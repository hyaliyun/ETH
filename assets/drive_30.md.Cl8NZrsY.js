Berlin, Ontario (now Kitchener, Ontario, and Preston, Ontario (now part of Cambridge, Ontario), were only apart, but the route required a bridge over the Grand River. Berlin's city council awarded the line a subsidy. The line operated for just three months. Ice flowing down the Grand River damaged piers of its bridge at Doon, Ontario. The bridge never re- opened. There were recriminations over the line's failure, and the satisfaction of those who inspected the line, and its bridge. Eventually, in 1863, an act in Canada's Parliament exonerated Berlin City Council. Edward Irving Ferguson acquired the line's assets, because he had held a mortgage on some of the line's property. He sold those assets to the Grand Trunk Railway, on November 14, 1865. The from Berlin, to the Grand River, at Doon, was incorporated into a route the Grand Trunk built from Berlin to Galt, Ontario.

The operation called for Allied forces to mislead the Wehrmacht into believing that the Allies were going to attack the island of Crete. Operation Rayon was successful in its aims and forced the Germans to divert forces from other fronts to defend Crete and Occupied Greece. The operation was planned and implemented by Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force.  Background  The Battle of Greece and the subsequent Fall of Crete resulted in the Allies being driven from Greece by a combined German and Italian force. Greece was brought under German occupation, with the industry and infrastructure of the country being used to support the German North African Campaign. The loss of Crete was a major defeat for the British Empire, which had used the island to support naval activity and to base aircraft. Considerations were made for an actual invasion to recapture the island, but these plans were abandoned as being too risky, and the British efforts to fight in North Africa were already taxing resources. As such, the Allies focused instead on disrupting lines of supply between the Italian colony of Libya and the European mainland to hinder the Axis armies in North Africa. On the opposing side, the Germans knew that Crete was of vital importance to the control of the Aegean Sea, and as such made efforts to defend the island from and Allied counterattack. In December 1941 Britain declared war on the Japanese Empire, leading to the opening of the Pacific War. As Australia and New Zealand were now threatened by the Japanese advance, many commonwealth soldiers were redeployed from North Africa to the Pacific. To cover the movement of these troops, the British conducted maneuvers designed to make the Germans think that an attack in Greece was underway. Communications were also leaked to Axis intelligence agencies to support this deception. British intelligence reports indicated an increase in German and Italian activity in Greece during the redeployment, with this reaction being the direct inspiration for what would become Operation Rayon.  Operation  In mid July 1942 Operation Rayon was implemented. Rayon was intended to draw Axis attention away from Allied convoys travelling to Malta and to divert forces from North Africa. The \\"Story\\" that was promoted to the Germans was that the Allies were preparing to launch an air and seaborne assault on the Island of Crete using British and Greek troops supported by American air power. False intelligence was planted with the intent to mislead the Germans. Rumors were spread by British intelligence among the Greek exile communities in the Middle East, hinting that the liberation of the Greek mainland was imminent. Greek soldiers and a Greek destroyer undertook actual assault drills in preparation for an invasion. Dummy landing craft and gliders were constructed and placed in areas that were known to be within the range of German reconnaissance planes. American aircrews deployed in Cyprus were put through drills. The result of these activities was mixed. A moderate increase in German activity on Crete was detected, and the operation succeeded in drawing attention away from a convoy bound for Malta.  Aftermath  Many of the 'A' force personnel involved in Operation Rayon were employed in Operation Zeppelin, another operation intended to mislead the Wehrmacht into believing an Allied invasion of Greece would occur. Dummy landing craft (dubbed \\"Drybob\\" and \\"Wetbob\\") used in Operation Rayon were later used in Operation Bodyguard.

Biography  Rosenthal AG (1951). Based on dancer Harald Kreutzberg in the dance Night Song to the music of Johannes Brahms. Waldemar Fritsch was born in 1909 as a tenth and last child in Altrohlau (today Stará Role, part of Karlovy Vary), part of the double monarchy of Austria-Hungary. His father worked as a fiacre in Karlovy Vary until the age of 75. After graduating from the Volks und Bürgerschule, Fritsch trained as a porcelain tool and mold founder in the \\"Viktoria\\" porcelain factory in Altrohlau. The area around Egerland, Karlovy Vary and Teplitz-Schönau were regarded as important sites of the porcelain and ceramics industry. Technical schools for the technical and artistic training of ceramists existed in Karlovy Vary (since 1925) and Teplitz-Schönau (1875), and in 1811 porcelain was produced in Altrohlau. Fritsch went to the Prague School of Fine Art from 1929 and the Porzellanfachschule Karlsbad-Fischern from 1926. In his creations, he drew attention by the artistic quality of small sculptures such as the terracotta-relief \\"Jugend,\\" a kitten and chicken group as well as a lying wolfshund. In Prague, he created porcelain sculptures of Saint Sebastian, a loreley, a cockatoos, and a woman with a child and a baby. In 1934, Fritsch received an assistant position at the state school for ceramics in Teplitz-Schönau, which he took over in the autumn of 1938. In 1939, he was awarded a professorship for applied sculpture to the State College of the Porcelain Industry in Karlovy Vary. After denouncing the Nazis, Fritsch was imprisoned in Dresden and Berlin by the Gestapo in 1939. When freed in 1940, he was forbidden to work. From 1943 and until the war ended, he served in the war service Wehrmacht. In 1946, he moved to southwest Germany with his 80-year-old parents, where he found a new home in Ansbach in 1947 after temporary stays in Stuttgart-Wendlingen and Ellingen. A period of great creativity followed after moving to Ansbach. His porcelain sculptures were in the Ansbach museum, which dedicated a special exhibition to Fritsch in 1963. He died 13 July 1978 in Ansbach and is buried in the cemetery of the church of St. Lambertus in Ansbach-Eyb.  Works  His works, in approximate chronological order are: *Scalare *Egerländer farmers couple *Girl with the carnation *Holy family on the run *Floating *Blessing Christ *Sinning youth *Venus in the arbor *Lying youth *Lying girls *Dreikönig's group *Listening *Christ's head *Young man's head *Allegory on Carlsbad *Day, night and morning *Night Song *Ecce homo *Xuchitl *Ixcauatzine  References   Further reading  ;By Fritsch: * Waldemar Fritsch: Porzellan, Keramik, Plastik.

Prelude In early February 1967, intelligence reported that the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 1st Division was operating in the Plei Trap Valley near the Vietnam-Cambodia border and the 10th Division was believed to also be nearby. The area of the operation was described as being \\"an area of almost continuous jungle with hardwood trees of several varieties up to six or seven feet in diameter and 200-250 feet in height. Where sunlight can break through the overhead canopy, the jungle floor is covered with thick, dense undergrowth restricting observation to a few meters and making movement extremely difficult. The area represents some of the most difficult jungle terrain in all of Southeast Asia. It is intersected by valleys and mountains with elevations varying from about 500 to nearly 600 feet, presenting additional difficulties to movement and maneuver.\\" Operation On 12 February, the 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division deployed two Battalions by helicopter into the Plei Trap Valley to establish operating bases. On 14 February Company C 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment (1-12th Infantry) discovered a series of new unoccupied bunkers near its landing zone (LZ) 501 North. The following morning Company C was engaged by PAVN forces who attempted to overrun the landing zone, but the attack was repulsed by air strikes and artillery fire. On 16 February as the rest of the 1-12th Infantry was being landed by helicopter they were fired on by the PAVN 8th Battalion, 66th Regiment, damaging 8 UH-1 Hueys. The PAVN continued to attack the LZ into the night but disengaged before dawn on 16 February. On the morning of 16 February, a platoon of the 2nd Battalion, 8th Infantry Regiment (2-8th Infantry) which was patrolling east of the Plei Trap was ambushed by the PAVN 32nd Regiment and forced to withdraw with gunship and artillery support. Inside the Plei Trap a company of the 22nd Infantry Regiment chased several PAVN soldiers who led them into an ambush and were unable to disengage until nightfall. By the end of 16 February, the 2nd Brigade had lost 55 dead and 74 wounded, while the PAVN had lost almost 300 by body count. Concerned about the high casualties, MG Peers ordered the units to stay near their bases for the next five days while the area was hit by artillery and air strikes, including nine by B-52s. Peers also received reinforcement by the 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division. On 21 February, a patrolling company from 2-8th Infantry was engaged by a PAVN heavy weapons position. US losses were 7 killed and 34 wounded, while PAVN losses were 43 killed. On 25 February, Company A 1-12th Infantry in the Plei Trap detected a PAVN ambush and called in airstrikes killing 48 PAVN and leaving three wounded behind for the loss of one US soldier killed. On 27 February, a US reconnaissance patrol from 1-12th Infantry was mistakenly inserted into Cambodia. The patrol killed two PAVN soldiers and observed numerous others before being extracted. On 2 March, a PAVN mortar attack on a 1-12th Infantry position killed two US soldiers and wounded two others. On 12 March, a company of the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment (2-35th Infantry) patrolling in the Plei Trap came under fire from a PAVN bunker complex. Two more companies were landed by helicopter but were quickly pinned down. As night fell the US force came under mortar fire from Cambodia, as flares illuminated the battlefield, the Americans observed that the PAVN were crossing the Se San river into Cambodia and helicopter gunships were called to attack the disengaging PAVN. By the following morning the PAVN had left the area leaving 51 dead, while US casualties were 14 dead and 46 wounded. On 13 March the PAVN launched a mortar attack on LZ 3 Tango in the Plei Trap, hitting it with over 300 rounds, killing 1 US soldier, wounding 87 and damaging 25 vehicles. On 16 March, the 2nd Brigade air-assaulted into the area of Plei Doc (), approximately 15 kilometres northwest of the Đức Cơ Camp. As the UH-1s carrying the 1-12th Infantry landed the PAVN triggered several command detonated mines destroying one UH-1D and damaging seven others and killing 5 US troops and wounding 13 others. The PAVN then engaged the infantry with rifle and machine gun fire before breaking contact as US air and artillery fire was brought to bear, leaving 10 dead. Also on 21 March, a long-range reconnaissance patrol from 1-8th Infantry operating near the Cambodian border lost radio contact with its headquarters and on 22 March Companies A and B 1-8th Infantry were sent to locate them. The US companies encountered a Battalion of the PAVN 95B Regiment and withstood several assaults before the PAVN withdrew into Cambodia leaving 136 dead. US casualties were 27 killed and 48 wounded. With the change of focus of the operation from the Plei Trap valley to Plei Doc and believing that the PAVN had left the area, the 1st Brigade began withdrawing from the Plei Trap. On 21 March a PAVN force ambushed Company C 2-35th Infantry in the Plei Trap killing 22 Americans and wounding 53 for the loss of 18 dead. Despite this evidence of continued PAVN presence and given the oncoming rainy season, MG Peers continued the withdrawal and 1st Brigade had left the valley by 28 March replacing the 2nd Brigade in Plei Doc. The operation finally concluded on 5 April 1967. Aftermath Operation Sam Houston appeared to end inconclusively like Operation Paul Revere IV in the same area. Total US casualties were 155 killed, while PAVN losses were 733 killed (body count). The PAVN were always able to control the place and timing of the fighting, withdrawing to their sanctuaries in Cambodia when American pressure became too great. Most of the engagements of the operation occurred within five kilometres of the Cambodian border. Rather than keeping large forces close to the Cambodian border, MG Peers decided to move his Battalions back from the border area which going forward would be patrolled by long-range reconnaissance patrols. The PAVN had developed effective tactics of \\"hugging\\" the US forces to reduce the effectiveness of B-52 strikes which could not take place within a safety margin of three kilometres of friendly positions. During the operation the XM148 grenade launcher was field-tested and found to be difficult to load in combat, while the XM576 40mm grenade was tested and found to be very effective for jungle use.

Kabir Khan engages in a love affair with Dimple Mirza and makes her pregnant. But Kabir later refuses to marry Dimple leading to the suicide of Dimple. Mirza Salauddin avenges death by killing Kabir and is sentenced to imprisonment. After he is released from prison, his son Raj falls in love with Reshma from the Khan family which resurfaces the old feud between the two families. Raj and Reshma elope to avoid the enmity between their families but this further complicates the situation.  Making  The production house Anandamela Cinema Limited bought remaking rights of three Hindi films including Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak and proposed the director Sohanur Rahman Sohan to make a film based on one of them. Sohanur Rahman Sohan decided to make a film with completely new leads. Moushumi, who was then an emerging model, was selected for the leading female role. Initially, Amin Khan was supposed to do the film as the lead protagonist in place of Salman Shah, but he was opted out of this film by director Sohanur Rahman Sohan and producer Sukumar Ranjan Ghosh and the leading male role was eventually given to Salman Shah after it was turned down by actor Tauquir Ahmed and model Adil Hossain Nobel. The film is also the playback debut of singer Agun.  Music  Alam Khan worked as the music director of this remake film while the original music in Hindi was composed by the Anand–Milind duo. Lyrics are written by Moniruzzaman Monir. Music was recorded in Anupam Recording Studio and singers were Runa Laila and Agun.

History  The Cyclone-4M is derived from the Tsyklon-4, which started its life as an all-hypergolic three-stage-to- orbit expendable launch vehicle planned for launch from a proposed site at the Alcântara Launch Center in Brazil. However, Brazil backed out of the partnership with Ukraine in 2015, citing concerns over the project budget, the ongoing financial situation in both countries, and the future of the commercial launch market. In March 2017, Canadian company Maritime Launch Services announced plans to begin launching a modified version, the Cyclone-4M, which features a Zenit-derived kerolox (LOXRP-1) first stage in place of the originally planned R-36 ICBM-based first- and second-stage.  Design  This new first-stage design would use four kerolox engines derived from the RD-120 used on the second stage of the Zenit. The standard RD-120, however, while manufactured in Ukraine, uses a number of Russian-made components which would have to be replaced with Ukrainian-made equivalents. It is also planned to fit each of these engines with a gimballing mechanism for steering (in the Zenit second stage the RD-120 is fixed to the frame while an RD-8 four-nozzle vernier engine takes care of the steering). Cyclone-4M is planned for launch from a site in Canso, Nova Scotia, with construction beginning in 2018. The second stage completed qualification tests in October 2019. The rocket's maiden flight is planned for late 2021. It's planned to launch up to 8 rockets per year from 2022.

The drama had its world premiere as part of the 2008 Adelaide Festival of Arts. It was written by renowned Australian playwright and screenwriter, Andrew Bovell. Synopsis The play opens to the sound of falling rain in the desert region of Alice Springs, Australia in 2039. Itinerant, eccentric wanderer, Gabriel York, is waiting for a visit from his adult English son, Andrew, after years of estrangement. Gabriel is keen to make a good impression. With an empty wallet, empty fridge and flooding barring the roads, Gabriel has no idea what to serve his son or where to find food. Suddenly a fish falls from the sky, landing at his feet. The action then shifts to the past, to a modest flat in London in 1959. The relationship between married couple Henry and Elizabeth Law (Gabriel York's grandparents) begins to suffer soon after their son (Gabriel Law) is born. In the same flat in 1988, Gabriel Law's relationship is strained due to his mother Elizabeth's refusal to shed light on his father's mysterious disappearance when he was only seven. Keen to retrace his father's footsteps and piece together his family's past, Gabriel Law journeys to Australia where he meets a vulnerable young roadhouse waitress, Gabrielle York. Gabrielle is troubled by her own tragic past, having lost both her parents in the aftermath of her brother's disappearance. The pair discover the truth about their family histories. Setting The play takes place in various timeframes between 1959 and 2039, in rural Alice Springs and Coorong, Australia and London, England. The 2039 scenes feel faintly apocalyptic. Much of the action is staged around a dining room table, where family members almost \\"catch glimpses of one another across time\\". Famous Australian landmark, Uluru can be seen as a surreal backdrop in several scenes. Characters The full list of characters is: * Gabriel York * Gabriel Law * Gabrielle York (younger and older versions) * Henry Law * Andrew Price * Elizabeth Law (younger and older versions) * Joe Ryan The original cast of the 2008 and 2009 production consisted of Paul Blackwell, Michaela Cantwell, Carmel Johnson, Kris McQuade, Yalin Ozucelik, Anna Lise Phillips, Neil Pigot and musician and composer Quentin Grant, who was a collaborator in the creative process and performed the piano music live. Structure The two hour full-length play is performed without an intermission. Its non-linear structure is unfolded in 22 scenes. The drama features several monologues. A critic from Time Magazine described the play as featuring \\"the most complicated time-shifting dramatic structure I've seen in years\\" due to the deliberately disorienting shifts in timeframe and characters from different periods often overlapping on stage. As the drama progresses, the connections between the interweaving stories and the characters become clear. Repetition and idioms, passed down throughout the generations, are devices used throughout the play. Described as a \\"poetic pretzel of a play\\", the drama has drawn comparisons to another structurally complex piece, Wajdi Mouawad's Incendies (also known as Scorched in English translation). Themes When the Rain Stops Falling explores themes relating to self- identity, abandonment, forgiveness and love and how inherited legacies shape our future in seen and unseen ways. The themes are referenced in Gabriel York's opening monologue as he nervously awaits his son: \\"I know what he wants. He wants what all young men want from their fathers. He wants to know who he is. Where he comes from. Where he belongs. And for the life of me I don't know what to tell him.\\" According to Time Magazine journalist Richard Zoglin, the time shifts throughout the play serve as metaphors for the \\"impossibility of escaping the past, for the way we are all shaped by what came before — and are living in the shadow of what comes next.\\" The drama poses the question of whether we have the capacity to correct the damage of the past in the present. For all its bleakness, there are surprising moments of humor. The play ends on a note of optimism and hope. Climate change and how it has reshaped the world is a major theme, with the textured soundscape and lighting design conveying both an ominous atmosphere and an unceasing tropical rainstorm in Alice Springs in 2039. In an interview, the playwright Andrew Bovell said the play depicted \\"the relationship between a family saga and the Anthropocene.\\" \\"We inherit what is unresolved from the past, and if we do not resolve it ourselves, we pass it on to our descendants. Are we prepared to pass on the damage from the past to our children?\\" An Australian ABC Radio review referred to the play as a universal quest for answers, tackling the scope of global issues about whether the environment will survive humankind to more personal questions about \\"how we can survive our own family histories and traumas\\". Premiere and production history The play was commissioned and originally produced by Brink Productions in Adelaide, South Australia, developed in collaboration with contemporary artist and designer, Hossein Valamanesh. When Rain the Stops Falling was first performed at the Scott Theatre, University of Adelaide, on 28 February 2008. Directed by Chris Drummond, the production was co-presented by Brink Productions, the 2008 Adelaide Festival of Arts and the State Theatre Company of South Australia. Australian productions have also taken place in Brisbane, Alice Springs, Cairns, Sydney and Perth. The play premiered in Europe at the Almeida Theatre, London, on 15 May 2009. This production was directed by Michael Attenborough and designed by Miriam Buether. In the United States, the play premiered at the Lincoln Center Theater, New York in March 2010 and was directed by David Cromer. In New Zealand, the Silo Theatre-produced drama premiered at the Herald Theatre, Auckland, in June 2010. The Canadian premiere was presented at the Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Canada. The show was directed by renowned Canadian director Peter Hinton to critical acclaim. The play’s development was supported by the Australia Council's New Australian Stories Initiative, Arts South Australia's Major Commissions, the Pratt Foundation and Brink Production’s Principal Benefactor Maureen Ritchie. Critical reception The Australian newspaper described it as \\"a spell binding saga\\" while the Sydney Morning Herald stated it was a \\"theatre of rare intimacy and resonance.\\" The Daily Telegraph commented that it was \\"Visually arresting, cleverly written and populated with interesting, gritty characters…a truly great addition to modern Australian theatre...\\" Time Magazine described it as \\"the best play of 2010\\". In contrast, the New York Times commented the \\"elaborate structure\\" made it \\"hard to fully immerse yourself in the destinies of the people onstage\\". Meanwhile, a Variety Magazine reviewer noted that the play \\"is likely to be a divisive work\\" due to its confusing narrative elements but acclaimed its \\"suspenseful and peculiar language, which is earthy and naturalistic but also intensely lyrical\\". Awards The play has won a number of awards including: * AWGIE Stage Award (2009) * Sydney Theatre Awards - Best new Australian work (2009) * Green Room Award - Best Production and Best New Writing for the Australian Stage (2009) * Louis Esson Prize for Drama (2008) * Queensland Premier's Literary Award - Best Drama (2008). The production at the Lincoln Center Theater, New York, in 2010 won in five categories at the Lucille Lortel Awards, including Outstanding Director, Outstanding Featured Actress, Outstanding Scenic Design, Outstanding Lighting Design and Outstanding Sound Design. The production at the Greenhouse Theater Center, Chicago won four awards at the 2013 Non-Equity Jeff Awards for Best Production, Best Director, Best Actress in a Supporting Role and Artistic Specialization.

P. gemmata was isolated from the gut contents of a marine invertebrate, specifically the detritivorous peanut worm Phascolosoma agassizii. P. gemmata’s growth under culture conditions, is through the development of a mature syncytial stage that undergoes sporogenesis and eventually releases endospores through one or more openings in the parent cell wall. Mature cells are multinucleated, with a cell wall, and can measure up to 200 μm. Endospores are amoeboid and some have pseudopod-like cell extensions.  Taxonomy  P. gemmata is a member of the Ichthyosporea clade, which is the earliest branching holozoan lineage.  Applications  P. gemmata can easily be cultured axenically in marine broth medium. Given its phylogenetic position as a close unicellular relative of animals, P. gemmata could potentially provide important insights into the origin of multicellular animals.

Recto Avenue corner Osmeña Street, Cagayan de Oro, in the city's central business district. It is owned and operated by SM Prime Holdings, the largest mall operator in the Philippines, and opened on May 12, 2017. The mall is the 2nd in Northern Mindanao and 61st mall in the Philippines by the SM Group. It is the 3rd SM Supermall to be called \\"Premier\\" after SM Lanang Premier and SM Aura Premier. It has a leasable area of 81,133 m2 and a gross floor area of 177,743 m2, making it the largest SM Supermall in Mindanao. History SM Prime Holdings President Hans Sy had previously disclosed that the site of the old Coca-Cola Plant along C.M. Recto Avenue cor. Pres. Osmeña Sts. will be developed into another SM mall. The mall would be called SM CDO Downtown Premier and be the second SM Mall in Cagayan de Oro. Construction of the mall started in March 2015. On March 15, 2017, tenant partners, retailers, food chains, service centers and merchants attended the tenant's preview of SM CDO Downtown Premier. On the same day, it was announced that the mall had an 85% occupancy rate. The mall hours before the grand opening On May 11, the mall held a blessing, mass and ribbon cutting, headed by City Mayor Oscar Moreno and some City officials; Hans T. Sy, Felicidad Sy and Jeffrey Lim, SM Executives; and Archbishop Antonio Ledesma, SJ. Shops were opened on that day for the invited guests. On May 12, SM CDO Downtown Premier opened its doors to the public opening only four levels of the mall with an 87% occupancy rate. On the mall's opening day, SM Cinema only opened 2 regular cinemas (Cinemas 3 & 4), and a large-format cinema (Megascreen). On May 30, it finally opened the two Director's Club Cinemas and the two other regular cinemas (Cinemas 1 & 2), opening all of its 7 cinemas to moviegoers. On June 9, almost a month after the mall's opening, SM opened the fifth level of the mall, making all levels open to the public. The opening was attended by City Mayor Oscar Moreno, together with some city officials, as well as some SM officials. The fifth level consists of shops, homegrown restaurants, along with the Sky Garden and Sky Hall. The Sky Hall is still closed to the public. The first bowling center in Northern Mindanao opened on the 5th level as well nearly two years later on May 4, 2019. On October 17, 2018, the BPO tower is finally open for leasing. Features The five-storey mall features anchor stores like The SM Store with three levels of shopping space, SM Supermarket, SM Bowling, and SM Cinemas, with seven theaters. It has service centers, specialty stores and restaurants and indoor parking spaces. Underneath the mall is a rainwater catchment basin measuring 75 x 40 meters floor area and as high as 6 meters which can hold up to 13,650 cubic meters of water to reduce the risk of flooding. One of the mall's main attractions is the first-ever large-screen format theater in Mindanao, called Megascreen, equipped with a Christie 6P laser projection system that produces the brightest images and most accurate reproduction of colors from the actual movie set and uses Dolby Atmos Sound System on Christie Vive Speakers,/ along with two Director's Club theaters for extraordinary cinema comfort and four digital cinemas offering 2D and 3D technologies to movie-goers. The mall also features a bowling center, a food hall, a sky hall with 800 seats, an al fresco dining and entertainment Sky Garden, and a central architectural feature called \\"Glass Curtain\\" which brings much of the natural light into the mall structure, and reflects lights from incoming cars on the CM Recto and Osmeña roads. This creates an effect that lights are falling down to a water fountain below it, leading to the main entrance. DSGN Associates, an award-winning architectural firm based in Texas, United States, designed the mall. = CDO Downtown Tower = The BPO tower is located along Osmeña St. The tower is a 12-storey building with helipad and 8 levels of office spaces for BPO companies.

Everest. It was originally a poem published in 1833 but was later altered to become a hymn. It was then edited by English hymnwriter Sir Henry Baker for inclusion in the Church of England's Hymns Ancient and Modern hymnal.  History  \\"Take Up Thy Cross, The Saviour Said\\" was written by American clergyman Charles William Everest (1814–1877) and was included in the Episcopal Watchman magazine titled \\"Visions of Death\\" in 1833. It was published in the United Kingdom a year later in The Tract magazine. It was first published as a hymn in the Union Sabbath-School Hymns hymnal in 1835. This hymn version of the poem later went back to the United Kingdom where it was published with alterations in the Salisbury Hymn Book in 1857. \\"Take Up Thy Cross, The Saviour Said\\" was eventually included in the Church of England's Hymns Ancient and Modern, being one of only two American hymns to make it into the first edition of the hymnal in 1861 (the other was \\"Thou Art The Way\\" by George Washington Doane). During editing of \\"Hymns Ancient and Modern\\", the editor Henry Baker made a number of alterations and added an extra verse to the hymn before inclusion. As a result, a majority of Baker's alterations continued to be used as the hymn crossed denominations including into the Methodist Church's United Methodist Hymnal.  Analysis  \\"Take Up Thy Cross, The Saviour Said\\" was written based upon Mark 8:34 where Jesus said \\"Whosoe'er will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me\\". It has been viewed as a \\"young man's hymn\\" because of vagueness in the wording. The hymn has commonly been used on Good Friday.  Music  A widely used tune is Breslau, a 15th-century German folk melody. Felix Mendelssohn wrote a choral arrangement of the tune for his 1836 oratorio, St Paul, and this harmony, or simplified versions of it, are frequently used.

Prelude After unsuccessful attempts to lure large enemy units into combat in Operation Crimp (8–14 January 1966) and Operation Mastiff (21–27 February 1966), Colonel William Brodbeck, commander of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division decided to reduce the size of units sent into the field in order to invite enemy attack. The plan called for a series of battalion sized operations around Bau Bang west of Highway 13, north of Lai Khê, where the Viet Cong 272nd Regiment of the 9th Division was believed to be operating. Operation On 3 March the 2nd Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment marched into the Lo Ke Rubber Plantation west of Bau Bang and established a patrol base. On 4 March patrols discovered trenches that could be used as jumping off positions for an attack on the patrol base. In the early morning of 5 March a patrol led by 2Lt Robert John Hibbs detected movement north of the base. At dawn they observed a supply column of children and armed women to the northeast of the base which met up with a company of Viet Cong coming from the north. The Viet Cong and some of the supply column moved south towards the patrol which then triggered two Claymore mines and began engaging the Viet Cong. The patrol then disengaged and moved back to the base, fighting through another enemy unit 100m from the base perimeter. 2Lt Hibbs and his sergeant stopped to help a wounded man, but were hit by Viet Cong machine-gun fire, 2Lt Hibbs then attacked the machine- gun position and was mortally wounded. The Viet Cong then launched an attack on the northern perimeter of patrol base but were repulsed and then started attacking from multiple directions. Airstrikes were called in and by mid- morning the Viet Cong withdrew. At 10:50 the 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment was deployed by helicopter to a landing zone 2 kilometres northeast of the patrol base in an attempt to block the retreating attackers. The Battalion moved southwest towards the patrol base engaging a small Viet Cong unit and reached the patrol base at 14:30. On 6 March the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment was also deployed into the area and the 3 Battalions swept the area finding only Viet Cong dead and equipment. The operation concluded on 8 March 1966. Aftermath Operation Cocoa Beach was a US tactical success. Total US casualties were 15 killed, while US claimed the Viet Cong losses were 199 killed (body count). 2Lt Hibbs was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor on 24 February 1967.

Originally conceived by Ethiopian artist Mihret Kebede during her art residency program between January to March in 2012 at the Deveron arts (Deveron projects) institute in Huntly, Scotland. The first successful event happened in March 2012 between Addis Ababa and Huntly. The idea of the Slow Marathon was to connect people in different worlds through art regardless of any paperwork and political discrimination that refrain people's mobility and integrity. The slow marathon participants walk at a pace that means they can take time to look at the landscape and consider a topic that is the focus of an associated discussion on the following day. The last person to finish the walk is deemed to be the winner.  History  Ethiopian artist Mihret Kebede created the project as part of a residency with Deveron Arts (now Deveron Projects). The artist had wanted to walk the 5850 miles from Ethiopia to Scotland, but this was not possible because of physical difficulties such as crossing deserts as well as closed borders and visa restrictions. Kebede calculated that if 225 people each walked 26 miles together they would have traveled the distance between Ethiopia and Scotland; in response, Mihret and Scottish artist Norma D. Hunter developed an accumulative marathon, which involved a 26-mile walk in and around the town of Huntly, and a parallel walk- in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The inaugural Slow Marathon took place on Saturday 17 March 2012. Kebede led the walk in Huntly, while in Addis Ababa it was led by artist Helen Zeru. Multiple Marathon World Record holder Haile Gebrselassie, participated in the walk in Ethiopia, as well as a shoelace exchange between participants in Scotland and Ethiopia. A discussion, Walk Sans Frontiers, was held on the day after the walk.  2013 - 2020  Slow Marathon 2013: Cabrach to Huntly Slow Marathon 2013 took place on Saturday 20 April as part of John Muir Day weekend; it served as the official launch of the Walking Institute. Walkers followed part of an original Hielan' Way crossing unexplored and remote countryside. Starting at the Upper Cabrach area the route went alongside the River Deveron and over the Clashmach hill to Huntly. Winning time for Slow Marathon 2013 was 12 hours and 45 minutes. A symposium entitled \\"Nature as Home\\", which commemorated John Muir, was held on the day after the walk. Speakers included Mike Daniels from the John Muir Trust, artists Penny Weir and Gill Russell and ornithologist, Roy Dennis. Slow Marathon 2014: Glenkindie to Huntly Slow Marathon 2014 took place on Saturday 10 May. The route went from Glenkindie past Kildrummy, Lumsden and Rhynie, through the Clashindarroch forest and over the Clashmach hill back to Huntly. It was inspired by the work of Scottish novelist and poet Nan Shepherd. Winning time for Slow Marathon 2013 was again 12 hours and 45 minutes. The walk was followed on 11 May by a Slow Day with the musician Jake Williams. Slow Maraton 2015: Portsoy to Huntly Slow Marathon 2015 took place on Saturday 25 April. It was led by artist Stuart McAdam as part of a project looking at the railway lines cut in north east Scotland following the Beeching Report. The walk took participants along the route of the former railway line from the coastal town of Portsoy to Cairnie junction before following the River Deveron back into Huntly. The winning team took just over 12 hours to complete the walk. The next day a Pathmakers Gathering discussed long distance walks and other pilgrimages with speakers including John Sparshatt, Christos Galanis, Marylin Lennon and Maureen Ross. Slow Marathon 2016: Along the River Deveron Slow Marathon 2016 took place on Saturday 16 April. The route followed the course of the River Deveron and was inspired by a project led by artist Anne Murray and musician Jake Williams called With and Against the Flow. In 2013 craft artist Anne Murray had walked along the side of the river Deveron from the sea via Turriff and Rothiemay to Huntly. Musician, Jake Williams, had walked in the other direction from the river's source at the watershed between Glenbuchat and the Cabrach to Huntly. The winner of Slow Marathon 2016 took just over 12 hours to complete the walk. On 17 April a Pathmakers Gathering led by broadcaster and film maker, Jasper Winn, discussed the significance of rivers. Other speakers included Richie Miller, George Rutton and Frank Henderson. Slow Marathon 2017: Correen Hills to Huntly Slow Marathon 2017 took place on Saturday 15 April, as part of a project by artist Andrea Geile looking at Energised Landscape. The route, which started in the Coreen Hills, took in places of energy from ancient stone circles to modern electricity pylons and wind turbines. An open discussion on sustainable energy was held on the following day. Slow Marathon 2018: Duffton to Huntly Slow Marathon 2018 took place on 22 April. The route started near Duffton along the river Isla, back to Huntly. As part of a project Walking Without Walls, Slow Marathon 2018 saw a collaboration between artists May Murad from Gaza and Rachel Ashton from Huntly. Inspired by the botanical collections of pacifist Rosa Luxemburg, the artists mapped out their routes by drawing inspiration from the wild plants they find in their respective places. Through the Walking Without Walls partnership Rachel and May found ways to collaborate artistically and socially despite restrictive political situations. Slow Marathon 2019: Route surrounding Huntly The Slow Marathon 2019 took place on 21 April 2019, and walked the local poem 'The Ba'Hill, the Battlehill, the Clashmach and the Bin, they all form a circle and Hunty lies within'. It was a circle of varied terrain - including woodland, farmland, hills, and along the river Deveron - started and finished in Huntly. During 20 April an open discussion took place about walking, poetry and the commons. Slow Marathon 2020: Under One Sky In May 2020 Deveron Projects announced that Slow Marathon could not take place as planned and instead called on people across the globe to come together and walk the world in an act of solidarity with communities suffering from the Covid-19 pandemic. The project is part of Under One Sky with artist Iman Tajik. https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/aberdeenshire/2222834/people- across-globe-encouraged-to-take-part-in-slow-marathon/ References 1  External links  * www.deveron-projects.com Walking art ","title":"Slow marathon"},{"id":"53501380","text":"Seven Princesses of Mediacorp (七公主) is a term referring to the seven most bankable young Mediacorp actresses from Singapore in the early 2000s, namely Jesseca Liu, Jeanette Aw, Rui En, Fiona Xie, Joanne Peh, Felicia Chin and Dawn Yeoh, then all in their twenties.

Thordis Elva Thorvaldsdottir () is an Icelandic author, speaker, playwright and activist for gender equality. In 2017, she gained world-wide recognition for writing the book South of Forgiveness. She was voted Woman of the Year 2015 by the Federation of Icelandic Women's Societies in Reykjavík. She specialises in violence prevention and digital rights, and has helped shape national policy on online abuse as well as gender-based violence. In 2017, Thordis Elva became one of the frontrunners of the #MeToo movement in Iceland, accepting the Person of the Year Award 2017 on behalf of the movement.https://www.ruv.is/frett/metoo-konur-eru-manneskjur-arsins She currently lives in Stockholm, Sweden.  Literary works  Thordis' most well known book is South of Forgiveness, a documentation of her sexual assault and journey to healing and freedom, in which Thordis collaborated with her perpetrator, making her the first rape survivor in the world to publicly do so. In 1996, Tom Stranger, aged 18, was offered a student exchange trip to Iceland where he met 16-year-old Thordis Elva at a theatrical event organized by the school they both attended. They began a romantic relationship in Reykjavík, and had been in a relationship for over a month prior to the sexual assault taking place. Stranger took Thordis Elva home on the night of a school Christmas dance where she had become intoxicated by alcohol. She was raped by Stranger in her home. Tom ended their relationship two days after the rape and returned to Australia when his exchange program was completed. Thordis Elva didn't press charges, explaining that she was \\"a 16-year-old kid with a head full of misconceptions ... I didn’t put two and two together and realise what I had been through was actually rape,\\" on the Australian talk show Q&A; in 2017. Nine years later at the age of 25, Thordis Elva, suffering from emotional trauma from the event, contacted Stranger by email and he responded. After 8 years of communicating via email, they arranged to meet in Cape Town, South Africa for a period of one week to \\"face their past, once and for all\\", discussing the impact of Tom's violent actions on both of their lives, in order for him to take full responsibility for it and for both of them to heal. In the months after returning home, they co-authored the book South of Forgiveness. Their aim was to contribute their story to the global dialogue about sexual violence, perpetrator responsibility and the importance of consent. Thordis also wrote the book, 'The Plain Truth' (Á mannamáli) about gender-based violence in Iceland and its status within the criminal justice system, the public discourse and the political landscape. The Plain Truth was one of the most critically acclaimed books published in Iceland in 2009, receiving a nomination to the Icelandic Literature Prize, amongst other awards. As a playwright, nine of Thordis Elva's plays have been professionally staged in some of Iceland's most prominent theatres. She was nominated to the Icelandic Theatre Prize as Playwright of the Year 2006, for her play 'Hunger'. She has also represented Iceland in conferences for the world’s best young playwrights (World Interplay, 2005 and Interplay Europe 2008).  Expert consultation work  Thordis has taken part in shaping national policy on gender-based violence, and was appointed by the Minister of Social Affairs to the committee that crafted Iceland's latest action plan to counter violence against women and children. She also contributed to the policy regarding abuse and ill treatment of children in Reykjavík municipality in 2015. After years of violence prevention work in the offline realm, she organised an awareness- raising campaign about image-based sexual abuse online (where intimate photos are shared without the photographed individual's consent, also known as revenge porn) and educated 18,000 people in a series of workshops across three countries in 2015 alone. She has spoken about the role of digital media in furthering gender equality at the UN and the Nordic Council of ministers and has contributed to anthologies about image-based sexual abuse online. In 2019, she was commissioned by Slovenian authorities to write recommendations as well as educate the country's policy makers and media professionals on violence against women and girls online. She was the keynote speaker at two of Europe's largest conferences on internet safety in 2019, the Safer Internet Forum and the Click Off Cyber Violence conference.  Public speaking  As an advocate for gender equality, Thordis Elva has spoken publicly for decades, serving as keynote speaker and expert panelist in various conferences and events in venues such as the UN Headquarters, the Sydney Opera House and the European Parliament. She has also toured with her co-author Tom Stranger and spoken publicly about their experiences, appearing on TED talks, BBC Newsnight and at London's Royal Festival Hall at the Southbank Centre.  Short films  Thordis Elva was commissioned by the Icelandic government to reshape the approach to violence prevention and sex education in elementary schools,https://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2012/09/12/fadu_ja_vitundarvakning_um_kynferdislegt_ofbeldi/ resulting in the short-films 'Get Consent' and 'Stand By Yourself', both of which were aired on national television and are still used in schools across Iceland with unprecedented results, according to a nation wide opinion poll. 'Get Consent' won first prize at the INSAFE conference in 2013 and has been screened in the UN and European Commission. 'Stand By Yourself' was also critically acclaimed, reaping a nomination the 2015 Edda Awards. In 2018, the short film 'Take My Picture' was released online, after receiving one of the largest grants from the Icelandic Equality Fund. All three films share the common themes of self-respect, bodily integrity and the importance of consent in all intimate exchanges, both online and offline.  Army of light  Thordis has created a large Instagram following, which she refers to as 'The Army of Light,' a term she coined during her high-risk pregnancy with her twins, Swan and Acer (born on May 8, 2018). She suffered PPROM in week 17 of her pregnancy, resulting in the rupturing of one of the twins' amniotic sacs. Doctors gave her a grim prognosis and a less than 1% chance of the twins' survival. She resisted doctor's recommendations to abort the pregnancy and remained confined to her bed for the following three months. She frequently refers to this as a very \\"dark period\\" of her life, but the support she received from strangers broke the isolation of her bedrest and lit up her days (hence the Army of Light reference). Born in week 28, the twins are healthy despite their prematurity and Swan, whose amniotic sac ruptured, has none of the respiratory problems that medical experts had predicted. Thordis Elva has paid tribute to her Army of Light in various interviews, saying that their support and light helped her stay strong when all hope seemed lost. She now uses this platform to spread awareness of others around the world who are going through a difficult time, encouraging solidarity and kindness. In January 2020, Thordis Elva announced to her Instagram followers that she was considering writing a book about the twins' survival and the role social media played in it.

In 1949, Emperor Bảo Đại gave the decree that all non-communist military forces in the country could function as independent armies within the main army in order to solve the problem of having the national army being too small. Shortly after, Bảy Viễn (Lê Văn Viễn), the leader of a major branch of the Bình Xuyên was given the rank of Major General of the Vietnamese National Army and his troops became the QDQG Bình Xuyên, which was a self-funded army with revenues that were derived from legally-run brothels and casinos; Bảy Viễn forcibly took control of the casinos from Macanese organized crime groups.Quân Sử 4, pp. 410-11La guerre d'Indochine, pp. 354-62 Despite being recognized as a legitimate military organization, by 1954, the Bình Xuyên had seized control over all of the opium dens in Saigon and dominated the distribution of opium throughout Southern Vietnam. The 60s and the era of the \\"Four Great Kings\\" Saigon, otherwise known as Ho Chi Minh City has had a long history of organized crime that often ran lucrative illegal activities within the city. During the 1960s period to before 1975, Saigon's underworld at that time was characterized by the era known as the \\"Four Great Kings\\", which referred to the four most dominant mobsters in the city, and whose names was immortalized by the infamous phrase \\"1st) Đại Cathay, 2nd) Huỳnh Tỳ, 3rd) Ngô Văn Cái, 4th) Ba Thế\\", with Đại Cathay assuming the role of \\"number one\\" or as the most dominant of the top four mobsters who collectively ruled Saigon. Đại Cathay at the time was known for running numerous illicit establishments, such as prostitution houses, night clubs, drug dens from between the first and third districts of Saigon, and through befriending various engineers, doctors, and artists, especially Hoang Sayonara who mentored Đại on the business strategy of organizing a casino for large profits, Đại continued to grow more wealthy, powerful and influential within the criminal underworld. Đại Cathay would go on to leave a lasting mark on Năm Cam, a mobster who would go on to later build his own fiefdom in Saigon during the 90s, and he did it mainly through his casino business, a method which he learned during his time of following Đại Cathay. = The \\"Mad Horse\\" of Chợ Lớn = In the fifth district of Chợ Lớn during the 60s, there were several different gang and mafia factions. One of the famous mobsters of Chợ Lớn was Tín Thầu Dậu or Tín Mã Nàm, nicknamed ngựa điên or the \\"Mad Horse\\", who was a famous mob leader of Hoa or ethnic Chinese descent, and was known as Hồng Trượng within the Triad, where he was the second highest-ranking member behind only Hoàng Long 黃龍 (meaning Yellow Dragon). Tín Mã Nàm once had his name listed among the Four Kings, Đại - Tỳ - Cái - Thế, which signified his role as a major player in Saigon's underworld along with the aforementioned Four Kings. Nàm made much of his fortune both through the supply of opium and heroin in Saigon along with other illicit activities and casinos. One of the major incidents that occurred during this time was a gang war between Đại Cathay and Tín Mã Nàm when Đại was trying to venture his lucrative activities into Chợ Lớn, which was in Nàm's territory. In 1964, a bloody gang battle ensued between the two gangs when Đại and his followers attacked the Great World quarters of Chợ Lớn with knives, swords, and bayonets. Though Đại's gang gained an early advantage during the fight, Mã Nàm's gang gathered their weapons and counterattacked, severely beating and bloodying Đại's gang, who were forced to flee. However, the battle had come at a great cost to Tín Mã Nàm; many people began to avoid his casinos and businesses, which was where the battle had taken place, causing his business to sharply decline. Tín Mã Nàm was then forced to call for a negotiation with Đại where he and many of the Chinese gangs in Chợ Lớn decided to give up away the areas between Nancy market and District 1 to Đại Cathay's gang.  The 90s Reign of Năm Cam  Trương Văn Cam, better known by his nickname Năm Cam was first initiated into the Saigon underworld by none other than Huỳnh Tỳ, who at the time was one of the \\"Four Great Kings\\" of Saigon. After the fall of Saigon in 1975 however, which ended the era of the Four Great Kings Đại - Tỳ - Cái - Thế, Huỳnh Tỳ turned into follower of Năm Cam in spite of being Cam's elder by 3 years. After spending years in a re-education camp, when Năm Cam was released, he quickly rose to the top of Saigon's underworld by amassing a substantial wealth around himself mostly through his illegal gambling activities. Using his wealth, Năm Cam was able to become nigh untouchable to authorities who were highly susceptible to his bribery, allowing him to operate freely and openly for much of the 90s until 2000, when Năm Cam ordered the murder of a rival female gangster named Dung Hà. Năm Cam would later be arrested and convicted of this murder in 2003, ending his reign over the city.

Synopsis Nina (Fanny Ardant), a French concert pianist, meets Ilan (), an Israeli computer specialist who is on vacation, in Paris. They fall in love, marry, and, move to Israel with their son, Gili (Daniele Napolitano). Not much later, Ilan is drafted into the Israeli military for compulsory military service, as the situation in the Middle East is worsening: Saddam Hussein has attacked Kuwait with his Iraqi forces and the Second Gulf War is imminent. After Nina is accepted into the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, she receives a call from the military and learns that her husband was wounded during a battle. She hurries to him and finds out, to her horror, that Ilan was not injured by enemy troops but by Israeli soldiers when he tried to leave his post illegally. While Ilan is wounded in a hospital and is unable to speak due to a state of shock, the accusations that he is a deserter, she finds out, are true. Despite this revelation, Nina continues to take care of him, breaks off an affair with another man, and tries to understand his motives. Their environment's reaction, however, extends not only to Ilan but also to Nina. When Nina's concert debut with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra is about to take place, symbolically, on the day of the United Nations' ultimatum to Saddam Hussein, the social pressure grows immeasurably.

Prelude On the evening of 27 November 1965 the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 7th Regiment, 5th Division operating in the Michelin Rubber Plantation was overrun by the Viet Cong (VC) 271st and 273rd Regiments, killing most of the Regiment (possibly up to 500 soldiers) and its 5 US advisers.. MG Seaman ordered Col. William Brodbeck's 3rd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division to rescue the shattered 7th Regiment. Several days later intelligence was received that the VC Phu Loi Battalion and the 272nd Regiment were operating in the area and the mission was changed to locating and engaging these units. The Viet Cong forces meanwhile prepared an ambush for the incoming assault planned by US forces. Operation Operation Bloodhound, later renamed Operation Bushmaster II, commenced on 1 December when the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment (2/2nd Infantry) was landed at Landing Zone Dallas () inside the Michelin Rubber Plantation. LZ Dallas was to serve as the command post for the two Battalions involved in the operation. From 2–5 December the US Battalions searched southeast of LZ Dallas in the VC base area known as the Long Nguyen Secret Zone. At midday on 5 December, three companies from the 2/2nd Infantry assaulted a VC base complex and were met by heavy fire from the entrenched VC. An American attempt to outflank the VC position was repulsed and the VC force then attempted to outflank and press the Americans who retreated into a defensive perimeter. The 2/2nd Infantry commander LCol. Shuffer called for air and artillery support and the 8th Battalion, 6th Artillery Regiment and 2nd Battalion, 32nd Artillery Regiment provided fire support on the southwestern perimeter, while air strikes were conducted on the east and helicopter gunships strikes on the north. The VC attempted to escape this firepower by \\"hugging\\" the American positions, but were forced back by small arms fire. The barrage continued for over 4 hours allowing the 2/2 Infantry to secure their position and to allow Companies A and C to move south behind a creeping barrage to overrun the VC bunkers. 18 aerial sorties were conducted alongside the artillery barrage, which prompted the VC to withdraw. By 14:30 the VC begun withdrawing, leaving behind their dead and wounded. LCol. Shuffer decided not to pursue the retreating VC fearing a further ambush and withdrew into a night perimeter. The 2/2nd Infantry spent the next few days policing the battlefield and destroying bunkers and Operation Bushmaster II ended on 6 December. Aftermath Total US casualties were 44 killed and 3 missing, while the US claims VC losses were 318 killed and 27 captured and 75 individual weapons were recovered. The 272nd Regiment disappeared for the next four months presumably to recover its losses.

Deliveries began in late 2017 for Continental European markets and in 2018 for the UK, Japan and Australia. Both in name and design, the new A110 harkens back to the original Alpine A110 produced from 1961 to 1977. Specifications Rear 3/4 view Interior with Sabelt seats Based on an all- aluminium construction, the A110 is powered by a 1.8-litre turbocharged gasoline direct injection 4 valves per cylinder inline-four engine mated to 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission manufactured by Getrag. Developed by Renault–Nissan and reworked by Alpine engineers, the engine has an output of at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 2,000–5,000 rpm. According to Alpine, the A110 can accelerate from in 4.5 seconds, and has an electronically limited top speed of . The A110 is available in three trims: Pure, Première, and Legende. The Pure cars, the base trim, have 17-inch alloy wheels. The Première trim cars are technically the launch edition models which were limited to 1,955 units and were equipped with amenities such as forged alloy wheels, quilted leather Sabelt bucket sports seats, a reversing camera, and metallic blue exterior colour as standard. The Legende trim cars come with six-way adjustable sports seats, black or brown leather interior upholstery, and an upgraded hi fi sound system along with specially designed wheels exclusive to this trim. All of the three trims share the same powertrain and transmission. A110S Introduced in June 2019, the A110S is a high performance and lightweight variant of the A110. The A110S benefits from increased power output (from ) from its 1.8-litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine as well as stiffer springs, new anti-rollbars, dampers, and carbon-ceramic brakes as sassed equipment. The ride height is lowered by and the car is fitted with special Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tyres having a stickier compound contributing to more grip on the tarmac. The engine was returned by installing a larger turbocharger. The peak power is achieved at 400 rpm higher than the standard engine. The 7-speed dual-clutch transmission remains unchanged. The new springs and anti-roll bars are 50 and 100 percent stiffer than the standard car. The ESC system has also been retuned to improve handling and comes with a full-defeat mode. Aesthetic changes include flag motifs, orange brake calipers and optional matte grey paintwork and lighter Fuchs alloy wheels. An optional carbon fibre roof with a gloss finish reduces from the total weight of the car which is . The A110S can accelerate to in 4.4 seconds (0.1 seconds faster than standard car) and has an electronically limited top speed of .  Motorsport  The Alpine A110 Cup was revealed in October 2017. This track-only version of the A110 utilizes the same chassis as the road car but has been modified to include a roll cage, adjustable suspension and racing brakes. The 1.8 L turbocharged engine is also similar to the street car but power has been upped to 270 hp that is transferred to the track through a bespoke racing sequential gearbox and Michelin racing tires. The car is designed for use in the new Alpine Elf Europa Cup series that will visit 6 tracks in Europe for its inaugural season. Only 20 cars will be built in its debut season and they are priced around €100,000 each. At the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, Alpine revealed a new GT4 version of the Alpine A110 Cup. This upgraded version of the A110 Cup comes with more power as well as revised aerodynamics highlighted by an extremely aggressive front splitter and a large rear wing. Customers of the original A110 Cup car are able to upgrade their cars to GT4 spec for a fee. The A110 GT4 began racing in the second half of 2018 so teams could test their new car in preparation for a championship hunt in the 2019 season. Other media The car attracted some attention in February 2018, when a company- provided car caught fire while being filmed for an episode of the British television programme, Top Gear. The responding fire personnel were not able to control the fire, and the car was burnt to destruction.\\"Top Gear Hosts Narrowly Escape Fire\\" This was due to a fuel failure when driver Chris Harris said, “There’s a red light on the dashboard, smoke, smoke, smoke!” James May remarked on the Alpine A110, pronounced (‘Alpeen’), \\"It has 248bhp, weighs the square root of diddly, and is the greatest thing to come out of France since the Mouli cheese grater.\\" May eventually bought an Alpine in mid 2018 referring to it as his car of the year. The A110 Premiere Edition appeared in Gran Turismo Sport via a February update alongside the original model. The 2017 A110 was introduced as a playable car to Forza Horizon 4 with the Season 17 Update which arrived on December 12, 2019. The A110 was runner up for the 2019 European Car of the Year award. It received the same number of points as the eventual winner (the Jaguar I-Pace) but with fewer first-place votes.

Gambierol is collected from the sea at the Rangiroa Peninsula in French Polynesia. The toxins are accumulated in fish through the food chain and can therefore cause human intoxication. The symptoms of the toxicity resemble those of ciguatoxins, which are extremely potent neurotoxins that bind to voltage-sensitive sodium channels and alter their function. These ciguatoxins cause ciguatera fish poisoning. Because of the resemblance, there is a possibility that gambierol is also responsible for ciguatera fish poisoning. Because the natural source of gambierol is limited, biological studies are hampered. Therefore, chemical synthesis is required.  Structure and reactivity  Gambierol is a ladder-shaped polyether, composed of eight ether rings, 18 stereocenters, and two challenging pyranyl rings having methyl groups that are in a 1,3-diaxial orientation to one another. Different structural analogues were synthesized to determine which groups and side chains attached to the gambierol are essential for its toxicity. Not only the fused polycyclic ether core is essential, but also the triene side chain at C51 and the C48-C49 double bond were indispensable. In the triene side chain, the double bond between C57 and C58 was essential. The C1 and C8 hydroxy groups were not essential, but they enhance the activity. The conjugate diene in the triene side chain also enhances the toxicity. Structure of gambierol with the stereocenters and atom numbers indicated.  Synthesis  The synthesis of gambierol consists of two tetracyclic precursor molecules, one alcohol and one acetic acid, that fuse together. The whole synthesis of gambierol is depicted in the figure below. After obtaining the octacyclic backbone, the tail is added via Stille coupling. The acetic acid (compound 1) and alcohol (compound 2) are converted to compound 3. The reaction of compound 3 with the titanium alkylidene from dibromide 1,1-dibromoethane, provides cyclic enol ether (compound 4). Oxidation of the alcohols gives majorly compound 5, but also compound 6. These are both ketones, but they have other stereochemistry. Compound 6 can be converted back in compound 5 with reactant c, thereby moving the equilibrium towards compound 5. This ketone can be converted further to produce reactive gambierol. By reductive cyclization of the D ring, the octacyclic core structure (compound 7) was made. Oxidation of compound 7 to the aldehyde was followed by formation of the diiodolefin. Stereoselective reduction, global deprotection and Stille coupling of compound 8 with dienyl stannane (compound 9) provide gambierol. Visual representation of the synthesis of Gambierol. The tetracyclic acetic acid and tetracyclic alcohol together, form the octacyclic backbone of gambierol. Stille coupling of compound 8 to dienyl stannane (9) results in the active, toxic form of gambierol.Reaction conditions: (a) Dimethyldioxirane, CH2Cl2, -78 to 0 °C; DIBAL, CH2Cl2, 90% (10:1 mixture).

It reduces the current through potassium channels irreversibly by stabilizing some of the closed channels. It acts as an intermembrane anchor where it displaces lipids and prohibits the voltage sensor domain of the channel from moving during physiologically important changes. This causes the channel to remain in the closed state and lowers the current. Gambierol also decreases the amplitude of inward sodium currents and hyperpolarizes the inward sodium current activation. Gambierol has a high affinity for especially K1.1-1.5 channels and the K3.1 channel. K1.1-1.5 channels are responsible for repolarization of the membrane potential. The K1.3 channel however, has additional functions by regulating the Ca2+ signaling for T cells. If they are blocked, the T cells at the site of inflammation paralyse and are not reactivated. K3.1 channels are responsible for the high frequency firing of action potentials. If the K channels are closed, the depolarized membrane cannot repolarize to its resting state, causing a permanent action potential. This leads to paralysis of, for example, the respiratory system and therefore suffocation of the organism. In neurons, gambierol has been reported to induce Ca oscillations because of blockage of the voltage-gated potassium channels. The Ca oscillations involve glutamate release and activation of NMDARs (glutamate receptors). This is however secondary to the blockade of potassium channels. The oscillations reduce the cytoplasmic Ca threshold for the activation of Ras. Ras stimulates MAPKs to phosphorylate ERK1/2 which induce outgrowth of neurites. This is however dependent on intracellular concentrations and interaction of the NMDAR receptors They both work bidirectionally. An increase in intracellular calcium concentration also activates the nitric oxide synthase to produce nitric oxide. In combination with a superoxide, nitric oxide forms peroxynitrite and causes oxidative stress in different sorts of tissues. This explains the toxic symptoms derived from intake of gambierol.  Metabolism  Metabolism of gambierol is not known yet, but the expectation is that gambierol acts almost the same as the ciguatoxins. Ciguatoxins are polycyclic polyether compounds. Their molecular weight is between 1.023 and 1.159 Dalton. Gambierol is structurally similar to ciguatoxins and it can be synthesized together with them. Excretion of these ciguatoxins is largely via the feces and in smaller amounts via urine. The compounds are very lipophilic and will therefore diffuse to multiple organs and tissues, for example the liver, fat and the brain. The highest concentration was found in the brain, but muscles contained the highest total amount after a few days. Because gambierol is lipophilic, it can easily persist and accumulate in the fish food chain. The detoxification pathways are still unknown, but it is possible to eliminate the gambierol. This will take several months or years.  Efficacy and side effects  The membrane potential and calcium signaling in T lymphocytes are controlled by ion channels. T cells can be activated if membrane potential and calcium signaling are altered, because they are coupled to signal transduction pathways. If these signal transduction pathways are disrupted, it can prevent the T cells from responding to antigens. This is called immune suppression. Gambierol is a potent blocker of potassium channels, which for a part determine the membrane potential. Gambierol is therefore a good option for the development of a drug that can be used in immunotherapy. This is for example used in diseases like multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus type 1 and rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment with gambierol is not being used yet, because the compound is toxic and also blocks other channels and thereby disrupts important processes. Intake of gambierol can also cause pain, because Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 channels are blocked and that increases the excitability of central circuits. It also causes illness for several weeks. This is explained by the fact that gambierol is very lipophilic. Lipophilic compounds have high affinity for the lipid bilayer of cell membranes. It is likely that gambierol remains in the cell membrane for days or a few weeks, which explains the long term illness associated with gambierol treatment. There are also other symptoms already explained by the mechanism of action of gambierol, for example difficulties with respiration and hypotension. Gambierol is also an interesting compound in research into treatments of pathologies like Alzheimer’s disease, which are caused by increased expression of β-amyloid and/or tau hyperphosphorylation. Increases in β-amyloid accumulation and/or tau phosphorylation affects neurons the most. The neurons will then be degenerated and therefore this process has effects on the nervous system. However, gambierol can reduce this overexpression of β-amyloid and/or tau hyperphosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Gambierols function in inducing outgrowth of neurites in a bidirectional manner can potentially be used after neural injury. After for example a trauma or a stroke, gambierol can be used to change the structural plasticity of the brain. The possibility of gambierol to cross the blood-brain barrier is very important in this case.  Toxicity  Poisoning by gambierol is normally caused after eating contaminated fish. Gambierol exhibits potent toxicity against mice at 50-80 μg/kg by intraperitoneal injection or 150 μg/kg when consumed orally. Symptoms resemble those of ciguatera poisoning. The symptoms concerning the gastrointestinal tract are: * Abdominal pain * Nausea * Vomiting * Diarrhea * Painful defecation The neurological symptoms include: * Paradoxical temperature reversion; cold objects feel hot and vice versa. * Dental pain; teeth feel loose.  First aid  Always contact a doctor. There is no antidote available for gambierol poisoning.

The scheme is also close to London Road, which has been long known for its large multi-cultural and Chinese community. The project is being developed by New Era Development (UK) Ltd, a private limited company that was registered with Companies House on 11 October 2013. The development has been dubbed \\"Sheffield's Chinatown\\" and \\"Sheffield's very own version of New York's Times Square\\" by the local media and has drawn the attention of the UK National press.  Development  The New Era Square development was conceived at least 9 years ago by UK-Chinese Sheffield businessman Jerry Cheung, who is prominent in the local community as a property developer, restaurant chain owner, Chair of Sheffield Chinese Community Centre and the winner of a 'Special Recognition' Sheffield Business Award in 2016. The project is being funded entirely by inbound Chinese investment into Sheffield, the numerous benefits of which have been reported by the local and business press. The architectural design for the project is being undertaken by Sheffield-based architects firm Hadfield Cawkwell Davidson Ltd. The initial planning application for a development at Boston Street, including \\"Demolition of existing buildings and erection of 3 buildings\\" was received by Sheffield City Council in Autumn 2014, including plans for a 21-storey tower. The application was granted conditionally for the demolition of existing buildings and the erection of a mixed-use development of 3 buildings comprising an oriental cash and carry supermarket, retail and commercial space, business accommodation and student apartments. Since the initial planning application, planning approval has also been requested for minor changes to the design scheme, including changes to the proposed office space in Phase 2 of the scheme. The proposed development, currently under construction (spring 2017), now consists of 5 blocks. The finished square will incorporate green roofs, outdoor lighting, leisure facilities for tenants and a pedestrianised plaza that will be open for public use, with landscaping by local Sheffield company Weddles. Work began on the construction of the development in late 2015, launching with a ground-breaking ceremony, for which event investors flew into the UK from China. The Derbyshire-based company Bowmer & Kirkland (B&K;) are the building contractors working on the scheme. The student accommodation, which includes studio apartments ranging in size in the first building of the development, is currently being let by the locally based Omnia Space agency and the first building is scheduled to open to student residents in September 2017.

Related to tambour lace, it was worked on very fine muslin, and used a variety of stitches to create motifs, usually depicting flowers and plants (hence its other name, flowered muslin). Sewed muslin industry in Scotland A notable developer of the industry in Scotland was Mrs Jamieson, the wife of an Ayrshire cotton agent. Seeing a philanthropic opportunity, she set out to teach local farmers' wives and daughters the trade, focusing on firm satin stitch, overcast fillings, and fine lace stitches in cut-out spaces. The designs were drawn up by professional draughtsmen in Glasgow before being sent out to be embroidered by outworkers. They were then bleached, made up, boxed and widely marketed, proving especially popular in North America.Margaret Swain, Ayrshire and Other Whitework (Shire Publications, 2001), p. 15. In 1791, the industry provided (often part-time) employment to as many as 105,000 women and children in Scotland, or approximately 86% of the entire workforce.Anthony Cooke, The Rise and Fall of the Scottish Cotton Industry, 1778-1914 (Manchester University Press, 2010), p. 42-3. The impact of the industry on the local population was noted by the minister of Houston, Renfrewshire in the 1790s, when he wrote that it allowed many young women \\"not only [to] maintain themselves, but [to] buy fineries.\\"Margaret Swain, Scottish Embroidery: Medieval to Modern (BT Batsford, 1986), p. 97. The muslins used in this industry came largely from local mills: the first cotton mills had been built in west Scotland in the 1770s, and by the 1780s the quality was high enough to supply the demand for fine white muslins, which became de rigueur to achieve the neo-classical style of dress.Heather Toomer, Embroidered With White (Heather Toomer Antique Lace, 2008), p. 106. The Ayrshire whitework industry was a victim of its own success, starting to decline from the 1830s onwards, after the patenting of the first embroidery machine in 1828,Margaret Swain, Scottish Embroidery: Medieval to Modern (BT Batsford, 1986), p. 21. which allowed similar motifs to be produced at a fraction of the cost. It continued in popularity until the 1850s, when a combination of over-production and cotton shortages imposed by the American Civil War saw to its demise. Sewed muslin from the wider Glasgow area came to be known as Ayrshire whitework, and is extremely similar to French whitework. The main difference between them is that French whitework is usually worked on cambric rather than muslin.Margaret Swain, Scottish Embroidery: Medieval to Modern (BT Batsford, 1986), p. 21.

Frye is known for her feminist literary criticism and interdisciplinary inquiry into motherhood. She specializes in research on fiction by and about women, such as the work of Virginia Woolf, Tillie Olsen, and Jane Lazarre. Frye's first book, Living Stories, Telling Lives: Women and the Novel in Contemporary Experience, was featured in Betsy Draine’s 1989 review essay, “Refusing the Wisdom of Solomon: Some Recent Feminist Literary Theory,” and in Ellen Cronan Rose's 1993 essay \\"American feminist criticism of contemporary women's fiction,\\" both in Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society. Draine cites Frye’s chapter on “Feminist Poetics” as an affirmation of “the explanatory possibilities of narrative, to develop new paradigms through which we can see our own experience” and notes the book’s emphasis on “the subversive first-person female” to move beyond the language of patriarchy. In the preface, Frye claims “a dual commitment: to the importance of affirming women’s own perspective on female experience and to the power of literature in shaping our culture awareness.” Rose notes this commitment to literature as “stimulus to personal and social change.\\" Frye has also been celebrated for her 2012 memoir, Biting the Moon: A Memoir of Feminism and Motherhood, in which she continues the concerns of her critical work and her past, which Frye situates in literary and cultural context. Frye married Ronald Tebbe in 1989. Her two daughters are teachers and writers; each is the mother of two sons.  Early life and career  Frye was born in South Bend, Indiana, to parents of Mennonite heritage. She attended Bluffton College in Ohio, studied modernist English literature in graduate school at Indiana University. Frye completed her dissertation on Virginia Woolf at Indiana University in 1974. In 1968, at age 23, a second- year doctoral student in English literature, Frye married Lawrence O. Frye, a German professor ten years her senior. While completing her dissertation, she lived on a farm and gave birth to two daughters, in 1971 and 1975. Following their divorce in 1976, Frye became a single mother to her two daughters. She writes in detail about her life in her memoir, Biting at the Moon: A Memoir of Feminism and Motherhood. Reviewer Marina DelVecchio describes Frye's memoir as a story that \\"introduces us to a woman who acts with feminist conviction before she even calls herself a feminist—before she establishes a successful Women’s Studies program her college.\\" Frye was hired into the English Department at the College of Wooster in 1976, where she taught courses in writing and literature, including single author courses on Virginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, and Charlotte Brontë; she chaired the English Department from 1991-94. In 1978, Frye led the Committee on the Status of Women in formalizing the Women’s Studies Program as a minor. In 1989, she led the program committee to faculty approval of a Women’s Studies major. Both proposals were collaborative efforts, building on the work of earlier faculty, including history Professor James Turner. Frye served as chair of the Women's Studies Program unofficially from 1978-1982 and again in 1983-84, and eventually as the first “official” chair of the Program from 1985-1989. In 2009, Frye retired from the College of Wooster, where she taught both English and Women’s Studies for thirty-three years. In a 2016 interview with College of Wooster student Alex Kauffman, Frye described her experience founding the Women's Studies Program (now Women's, Gender & Sexuality Studies [WGSS] Program): > Reflecting on these forty years of Women’s Studies at Wooster, I am acutely > aware of the ongoing importance of studying the force of gender and > sexuality in our lives, the intersecting powers of race and class, and the > ways in which culture moves in response to concerns with gender.

The title traces its origin from the times of the Old Pahang Sultanate, and was historically known as Seri Maharaja Perba. The traditional pegangan ('fief') of the nobility is the land from Tanjung Lindung, the entire Jelai River basin (roughly covering the Cameron Highlands and Kuala Lipis constituencies), to the borders of Perak and Kelantan, excluding the Tembeling. It is the largest fief in size and the farthest in distance from the royal court in Pekan, thus making the Maharaja Perba the most powerful among the four major chiefs. During the reign of Raja Bendahara Tun Ali, with the gradual centralisation of the royal court, the title was renamed 'Orang Kaya Indera Maharaja Perba' with the added 'Orang Kaya Indera' prefixes. In modern times, it was again renamed 'Orang Kaya Indera Perba Jelai'. Role Historically, the Orang Kaya Indera Perba was part of the Orang Besar Berempat ('four major chiefs') that wielded very wide powers in Pahang. They had the authority to impose taxation and to decide all criminal and civil cases except those which involved capital punishment. In fact, their power was limited only by the capacity of the monarch to restrain them, and it varied according to their proximity to Pekan, the further from the court, the greater their authority. They were obliged to appear at Pekan once a year to menjunjung duli ('pay homage'). They had to pay a form of tribute called banchi to the monarch. Their districts were subject to serahan; the obligation to buy, at exorbitant prices, goods the monopoly for the sale of which, in certain localities the ruler was in the habit of granting to one of his favourites. In the month of Muharram. they appeared at court with offerings. In the time of war they were required to take the field with men, arms and food. The installation of the monarch was incomplete unless the Orang Besar Berempat assisted thereat. The Pahang constitutional theory was that the Orang Besar Berempat and, to a lesser degree, the other chiefs were the foundation upon which the monarch's authority rested. During the time of Johor Empire, the four major chiefs gave allegiance to the Bendahara as representing the Sultan, but, in time, the sovereign being to them a nebulous figure, their allegiance tended to become more and more a matter of loyalty to the Bendahara personally. This became formally sealed with the establishment of Pahang Kingdom in the late 18th century. Succession The titles of the Orang Besar Berempat were hereditary. When a chief died, his successor, before approval of his appointment, was required to make a ceremonial offering to the monarch. This usually took the shape of gold-hilted kris, but other forms of offering were permissible. If the eldest son of a deceased chief were unfitted for the succession, it was proper to appoint a younger son, a brother, or a nephew to the chieftaincy. Genealogical tree There are varying genealogical accounts extant of the powerful family of the Jelai Chiefs. One of which, the oldest, was at one time in the possession of one of the eight nobles, Orang Kaya Maharaja Setia Raja Haji Wan Daud. It lay claim that the Jelai Chiefs family were of Minangkabau origin. Another account, collected by Arthur Furley Worthington from Che Sat of Penjom, attributes the family to Perak origin. According to another account possessed by the Jelai Chief family itself, which doesn't specify the family's origin, the first Maharaja Perba was said to have purchased from the Sultan of Johor territory in Pahang extending from Tanjong Lindong (above modern day Jerantut) to the boundaries of Perak and Kelantan. The price was a levelled (or full) gantang of gold, a coconut-shaped vessel filled with gold, and an arm-sleeveful of gold. This account is taken as the most faithful so far, since it is corroborated by Pahang tradition emanating from another source, Hikayat Pahang serta Johor.

It has since been renamed The Peace Diamond. Discovery The Peace Diamond was discovered on 13 March 2017 by a team of five diamond miners. The miners brought the diamond to Pastor Emmanuel Momoh, manager of the Majestic Exploration & Mining Company Limited and owner of the mineral concession licence. Momoh found the diamond while searching through river sediment in a community artisanal licence area belonging to the community of Koyardu Village within the mineral exploration concession licence of Majestic Exploration & Mining Company Limited. He is not a professional diamond hunter. He looks for diamonds as a freelancer or artisanal diamond hunter. Momoh said that he had the option of fleeing to Belgium with the diamond using the help of a local dealer. However, he handed over the diamond to the government with the hope that it would help increase recent development in the country, and especially the impoverished Kono district. The diamond The uncut found diamond is slightly smaller than a hockey puck. It is one of the twentieth largest ever found and the largest discovered in the past forty years. It is the second largest found in Sierra Leone, the largest being the Star of Sierra Leone, a 968.9-ct diamond discovered in 1972. The diamond appears to have a reddish stain coating it. The Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources has attempted to clean it by \\"boiling (it) in hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid for 72 hours\\". Auction Ernest Bai Koroma, president of Sierra Leone, stated that the Ministry of Mines was given \\"clear instruction to the Ministry of Mines that the evaluation, sale and distribution of the proceeds must be done in the most transparent manner.\\" He also said that Momoh, who is officially its present owner, would be given a certain amount of the proceeds after the diamond is sold at auction. Momoh has been involved in the weighing, cleaning, and bidding of the stone, and states that he is satisfied with the transparency of the process. The diamond is now in a safe at the Bank of Sierra Leone, Sierra Leone's central bank in Freetown. By April 5, 2017, there had only been six offers for the diamond. In response, the deadline was extended to May 10. Pastor Emmanuel Momoh Pastor Emmanuel Momoh was born on December 25, 1975. He comes from the Idah Local Government area in Kogi State, Nigeria, and is of the Igala tribe. Momoh graduated from Federal Polytechnic, Idah where he received a National Diploma in electrical and electronics engineering. He then graduated from Kaduna Polytechnic where he received his Higher National Diploma in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering. He currently owns and manages a computer service company in Lokoja and is an Evangelical preacher. On October 3, 2015, Momoh was ordained and became Pastor by the general overseer, Bishop (Dr.) John Ibenu. He is currently serving at the Headquarters Church, Adankolo New layout, Lokoja, Kogi state. Momoh is married to Rose I. Momoh. They have three children, Mercy, Deborah and Joan.

The deal was unique for a network in that the series was published by the independent Incorgnito Press, and was printed digitally on-demand. He is represented by CAA. In 2001, Eisenberg co-wrote Out of the Black with Karl Kozak, an independent feature that won 17 national film festival awards. The film starred Tyler Christopher, Jason Widener, Dee Wallace Stone, Sally Struthers and Sally Kirkland. In 2004, Eisenberg, an avid book collector, was hired by a private party to identify, organize and archive a substantial lot of unidentified handwritten materials. These materials were soon verified as original John Steinbeck writings considered \\"lost\\" to history, and have been since referred to by a noted historian as \\"one of the most important literary discoveries of the century.” In 2005, he wrote the non-fiction inspirational tome, How to Survive a Day Job, which featured contributions from established public figures as to how they survived the day job experience, en route to working professionally within the arts. Contributors included Clive Barker, Stephen J. Cannell, director Robert Wise (in his final interview), Brad Meltzer, Laurell Hamilton, Larry Hagman and others. Later that year, he co-founded All Cities Media with partner Eric Shaw, an entertainment-centric networking group hosted by Paramount Studios, Warner Brothers Studios, Sunset-Gower Studios and more. The goal of ACM was to level the playing field between filmmakers and finance. Eisenberg concluded his participation in the group in 2014. April Showers was a critically acclaimed feature film executive produced by Eisenberg, and released in 2009. Based on the Columbine School Shootings tragedy, April Showers was written and directed by Columbine survivor Andrew Robinson, and was awarded a special citation by the U.S. House of Representatives for its co-star Tom Arnold and his fight for the continuance of school safety standards. He is developing several film projects, including the Alzheimer's-themed January Rain as co- writer and producer, and Louis vs Schmeling, a boxing biopic co-written with Gilbert Adler, to be directed by Bill Duke. Eisenberg is also executive producing Then Again with Herbie J Pilato, an Inside the Actor's Studio-type talkfest focused on classic television, for Decades Network, a CBS and Weigel Broadcasting station, and Shadow Show with Vincent Price, based on the bestselling anthology edited by Sam Weller and Mort Castle, and the subsequent IDW Comics adaptation. For other networks, Eisenberg continues to develop several projects based on various pop-culture brands. Letters from a Drugstore Cowboy, based on the unpublished writings of James Fogle – the inspiration for the film, Drugstore Cowboy – was optioned to FOX Studios in 2013. Since 2014, he has been penning the eight-volume The Chronicles of Ara fantasy novel series with Steve Hillard, a continuation of Hillard's book, Mirkwood: A Novel About J.R.R. Tolkien. Eisenberg and Hillard formed Mirkwood Partners, LLC in 2015, a feature film and television development company. In 2017, the company was renamed Council Tree Productions. Co-Production deals set up through Council Tree Productions include the reality-based \\"Race For Space\\" with Roddenberry Entertainment, \\"Farway Canyon\\" based on the independent comic book of the same name with Buffalo 8, and \\"Terror Talk\\" with the Roku station Terror TV. Eisenberg has been writing professionally since 1986 in varied media, starting as a columnist for a series of national professional wrestling and martial arts periodicals. He has successfully marketed various projects to Public Television supporters for national and local program funding, including California's Gold with Huell Howser, American Playhouse, Masterpiece and The Puzzle Place.

The album features Amidon’s radical reworkings of traditional folk songs, with chamber-orchestra arrangements by composer Nico Muhly; multi-instrumental contributions from Shahzad Ismaily, and guest vocals by Beth Orton. It was produced and mixed by Valgeir Sigurðsson at Greenhouse Studios in Reykjavik and released on the Bedroom Community label.  Background and recording  The songs for I See the Sign consist primarily of Amidon’s reworked renditions of traditional American folksongs, drawing on shape note hymns, murder ballads, and singing games from the Georgia Sea Islands, as well as a cover of the R Kelly song Relief. The album’s recording emerged from the Bedroom Community label, with appearances from all of the members from the label at that time, and recorded entirely at Valgeir’s Greenhouse Studios in Reykjavik. In a 2010 interview with Popmatters, Amidon described how the process started with himself and Ismaily and went from there: \\"When Shahzad and I went into the studio in Iceland, we put many of the basic tracks down live together, with him playing bass or drums or percussion or strange noises or Moog or electric guitar, basically playing everything there was to play. Some he’d do live with me, and other parts he’d add later – he is able to play many instruments at once, but not all of them. He has many limbs. When he was playing his drum parts, I sat at a very large oak table in front of the drum kit and waved my arms in the air and drew diagrams for him to follow or disobey. After that point, it took on more of the shape of the way I made the last few records – Nico’s arrangements were added without my presence, I arrived last summer and there they were in all their mind-altering twinkling glory; and Beth Orton came with me to Iceland to sing on a number of songs and we did those together, and then Valgeir and I spent time carving things away from everything that had been added and figuring out what we had.\\"  Release and reception  I See the Sign received a strong reception from critics and appeared on many year-end lists, including Ben Ratliff’s Top 10 in the New York Times, and an honourable mention in Pitchfork’s year-end albums roundup. Discussing the songs of I See the Sign in the Times, Ratliff wrote, \\"Playing guitar or banjo as he sings, [Amidon] transforms all of them, changing their colors and loading them with trapdoors. He slows them down and rewrites their harmonies, making curious, arty, quiet pop in his own mood — ornery, sensitive, distant. I See the Sign is a seriously intelligent record, but never cute or overbearing; its Icelandic producer, Sigurðsson, has left it dry and full of space, so that you hear the seams.\\" Pitchfork’s review stated that \\"interpretations are so singular that it stops mattering how (or if) these songs existed before-- all that matters is how they exist now.\\" The All Music Guide review says that \\"Each of these collaborators adds to the album's rich, expansive, textural palette, allowing considerable psychological range within its generously subdued tone… But always at the forefront are Amidon's voice --which recalls Will Oldham in its restraint and slight rustic roughness -- and, especially, the songs he has chosen to make his own.\\" Amidon toured the album extensively, both on his own and as a member of the Bedroom Community Whale Watching Tour, which brought together Muhly, Frost, Sigurðssson and Amidon to perform a concert of each other’s music collaboratively. The experiences of this tour and its concerts were documented in the film Everything, Everywhere, All The Time.

History The cause which would eventually become Albany Road Baptist Church began in 1894 in nearby Cottrell Road, located in rooms above a stable. Initially, it was Particular Baptist, with Communion available only to those baptised by Immersion, and membership denied to anyone involved in the drinks trade. In 1898, the congregation moved to its present location on Albany Road, and founded a large school chapel, which is still in use. Th adjacent corner site was left empty, as it was desired to build the planned church free of debt. The church became 'open communion' in 1916. The building of the planned church was delayed through lack of funds and the First World War. It was eventually finished in 1932, though the tower was built far smaller than originally envisaged. In 1971, the school chapel was converted into upper and lower halls, and a coffee bar was added. A glass frontage and vestibule were added in the centennial year of 1994.Rose, J. Cardiff Churches Through Time. Amberley. 2013. p. 58 In the late 1960s, the church played a significant role in the founding of Christchurch United Church in Llanederyn. Albany Road presented proposals for the establishment of a new church in the expanding suburb, but the Roath Park Council of Churches to whom the plans were presented were unable to act on them. Being independent of any central control, Albany Road proceeded with the plans alone. It applied for one of the three sites on the estate which had been earmarked for church use. Several members of the church left to form the new congregation, which began worshiping in the hall of St Teilo's Church in Wales High School in 1967, then moving to a newly built hall in 1969 until the present church was completed in 1977. Present The church is said to have 156 Baptist members. The church is heavily involved with the local community and runs several creches, a youth group, arts and crafts classes and lunch clubs.

Following an earlier cold wave in the winter, the period of below-average temperatures contributed to an already unusually cold winter for the Eastern U.S. Several places broke their records for their coldest February on record, while some areas came very close. The cause of the cold wave was due to the polar vortex advancing southwards into the eastern parts of the U.S, and even making it as far south as the Southeast, where large snow falls are rare. By the beginning of March, although the pattern did continue for the first week, it abated and retreated near the official end of the winter. In addition to the extremely cold weather, multiple winter storms affected nearly the entire United States, especially in the snow-weary Northeast, which had already seen nearly of snow in the latter part of January; this was added to by roughly more snow, leading to Boston having its highest seasonal snowfall on record.  Origins  Like most normal cold waves, the cold wave was caused by the southwards movement of the polar vortex into the United States due to changes in the jet stream in early February 2015. However, unlike most which last for a few days, this one remained for much of the entire month. This was partly due to the Ridiculously Resilient Ridge, which persisted over parts of Alaska for much of the month, essentially keeping the jet stream pattern \\"locked\\" for several weeks. This allowed for bitterly cold air masses to migrate southwards into the eastern part of the country, leading to well-below average temperatures.  Record temperatures  The average temperature in Boston for January was below the 1981–2010 normal, and the average temperature in February was , which was below the 1981–2010 normal, making it the second-coldest month of any month all-time, behind February 1934. March was below average. By the end of a period spanning from the beginning of February to the end of December, Worcester, Massachusetts, saw a record of snowfall, breaking the record set in 2004–05, which was over the average. Hartford, Connecticut, and Providence, Rhode Island, saw similar below-average temperatures for the two months, with Hartford's February finish of besting February 1934 to become the coldest month of any month all-time in record keeping. The average temperature in Bangor, Maine, for February was , about below normal, breaking the old record of set in January 1994. Portland, Maine, also saw a record coldest average monthly temperature of in February. On February 24, 2015, the temperature at Dulles International Airport in Northern Virginia dipped to , breaking the previous daily record of set in 1967 (but not the all-time low at the airport of -18°F or -28°C set on January 22, 1984). Rutland, Vermont, saw a record averaged cold for February of , breaking its previous record of set in 1934. Montpelier, Vermont, realized its coldest February with an average temperature of , below the 1979 record of . The average February temperature in Syracuse, New York, was degrees below normal at , breaking by 3 degrees the record set in February 1934. The average temperature in Buffalo, New York, set a record in February for its all-time coldest month with an average temperature of . breaking the prior record set in 1934 of . Before that, the previous coldest February was in 1875 with an average temperature of . It was also the second time in history that the entire month of February was below freezing. Other cities that broke cold weather records for February included Cleveland, at , while Chicago tied its February 1875 record at . Rochester, New York, also set a record for coldest month overall. Ohio experienced the coldest winter since 1977–78 with an average temperature of below normal. Toronto recorded its coldest month on record in February with at Pearson Airport, tying with February 1875 (recorded in downtown) and beating the previous record of set in January 1994. In Quebec, Montreal experienced its coldest February on record with an extended cold spell and an average temperature of . Related weather  Most of the northern half of the United States and even parts of Canada saw several winter storms impact them; each of them had somewhat unique traits. At the start of the month, a major snowstorm was moving across the country, having previously brought blizzard conditions to the Midwest, especially in Chicago, Illinois, where more than a foot of snow was recorded. This storm continued to dump large amounts of snow as it progressed into the Northeast and New England, before finally exiting offshore.http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/winter_storm_summaries/event_reviews/2015/Southwest_Northeast_WinterStorm_Jan2015.pdf Less than a week later, another winter storm struck New England, with up to nearly of snow recorded in Boston, Massachusetts over a period of two days. This was the beginning of a three-week streak of winter storms that would progress into the Northeast (with the expectation of one system which went further south). Around the middle of the month, near Valentine's Day, a powerful blizzard struck the Northeast again, bringing strong winds and more heavy snowfall. Afterwards, as the storm exited, it ushered in the coldest air to impact the Northeast in decades, with temperatures dipping as far as below average. Several places broke record lows for February, and temperatures even dipped below in a good part of the Northeast.http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/winter_storm_summaries/event_reviews/2015/Northeast_US_WinterStorm_2_Feb2015.pdf Several more winter storms followed afterwards, but one of the more notable ones was the one that occurred from February 25–26. This particular storm took an unusual track into the Southeastern United States as the jet stream along with the polar vortex pushed even further southward, resulting in heavy snowfall in states that rarely see it at all, this included Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas.

Gamgee was educated at a number of institutions across Italy, Germany and Switzerland before graduating from the Royal Veterinary College in London in 1852. In 1855 he returned to London from the continent to lecture in veterinary medicine and surgery at Camden Hall in Camden Town. He was then living at 16 Upper Woburn Place. Following the death of John Barlow he was invited by William Dick to come to Edinburgh to lecture in animal anatomy and physiology.

Appointed by the Privy Council to study the problem of diseased meat being used for human consumption (especially in London), he identified the threat of rinderpest from imported Baltic cows, and other issues. In 1863, Gamgee organized the first conference of what would evolve into the World Veterinary Association. During a study trip to the USA to look at Texas fever in cattle he encountered and became fascinated by refrigeration. He was the developer of the Glaciarium, the world's first mechanically frozen ice rink in 1876. His investigations also led to the world's first refrigerated ships. He later became involved promoting refrigeration technology. He developed what was purported to be a perpetual motion machine known as the Zeromoter. The Zeromoter was intended to use ammonia within a refrigeration system to power ships. The technology gained the support of US President James Garfield, before being debunked.

This was shortly after he was crowned winner of the third season of the reality competition series RuPaul's Drag Race. Raja and Anthony Garza wrote the single in collaboration with its producers Eddie Amador and Josh Peace. Raja said that he recorded the song due to the close connection between drag and music and his desire to experiment in the medium. Backed by an electronic beat, it is a neo-pop track with lyrics revolving around sexuality. The song was noted by music critics for its combination of pop music, techno, and electro music. Critical response to \\"Diamond Crowned Queen\\" was mixed. Although its composition divided music critics, these commentators generally agreed that the song is one of the better tracks released by a RuPaul's Drag Race alumni. The single peaked at number 35 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart, making Raja the only RuPaul's Drag Race season three contestant to appear on a Billboard chart. Austin Young directed the song's music video, which featured Raja in various outfits both in and out of drag. American drag queen Raven makes a cameo appearance in the video. It received positive attention from media commentators for its style and Raven's inclusion. To further promote the single, two remix extended plays (EPs) were released and Raja performed it on the RuPaul's Drag Race tour.  Background and composition  After winning the third season of RuPaul's Drag Race, Raja released his debut single \\"Diamond Crowned Queen\\" on May 3, 2011, through the record label Citrusonic Flavor Recordings. It was the first single from the record company. Disc jockeys Eddie Amador and Josh Peace produced the three- minute, 51-second track, which features Raja singing a \\"a series of boasts\\" over an electronic beat. It was written by Raja and Anthony Garza in collaboration with its producers Amador and Peace. Raja said that he recorded a single as he felt that music was closely connected to drag, explaining: \\"[I]n this day and age, it’s like everybody has to put out a song. It’s kind of the next step: You were on a reality show, now you have to put out a song.\\" He said that he felt a personal connection with the recording process as he had \\"[his] own soundtrack to [his] life that [he] play[s] everyday\\". During an interview, he also described the single as a part of his experimentation with music. Adem Ali of Forté Magazine identified the song, along with Raja's subsequent releases, as exemplifying the singer's \\"blend of club-kid neo-pop\\" combining elements of pop, techno, and electro music. Raja said that his music was inspired by electro house and disco. \\"Diamond Crowned Queen\\" was called a \\"grungy dance mix\\" by WEHOVille's Whitney Friedlander. The instrumental is provided by \\"deep, throbbing beats\\" and electronics. Rolling Stones Lyndsey Parker described Raja's vocal performance as a \\"whole lot of groaning\\", and Bustles Anneliese Cooper classified it as an example of \\"crazy shit shouted to a beat\\". In the chorus, Raja sings \\"Follow me, follow me, I’m a diamond crowned queen. Come with me, to my pretty, pretty palace, Gonna lick on your trigger, every inch will make you quiver.\\" Other lyrics include other sexual references, such as: \\"S-E-X, sex for dinner / I'm a thunder-breathing dragon cat.\\"  Reception  \\"Diamond Crowned Queen\\" received mixed reviews from music critics on its release. Lyndsey Parker listed it as one of the eight listenable singles by a RuPaul's Drag Race contestant, describing it as \\"a deliciously trashy track\\". Comparing the song to The Normal's \\"Warm Leatherette\\" (1978), Parker wrote that \\"Diamond Crowned Queen\\" contained elements of \\"'70s sleazefeasts [...] '80s industrial, and mid-'90s house music\\". It was also positively received by Anneliese Cooper, who said it left her \\"gagging\\" noting its lyrics \\"will win my heart, every time\\". Patrick of Homorazzi.com described the song's chorus as \\"[d]irty and hot\\". While writing for Yahoo! Music, Parker included the single on her list of the seven \\"actually great singles\\" by RuPaul's Drag Race contestants. She described it as one of eight \\"listenable\\" singles released by the show's participants. FemaleFirst's Daniel Falconer agreed with Parker, placing the song on his list of the best music to come out of the reality television show. Several media commentators were divided on the single's composition. In his review of Raja's entire music catalog, Adem Ali observed that his sound was \\"an acquired taste\\". Bradley Stern of MuuMuse wrote that the song was too \\"erratic for [his] taste\\", but was more positive to the remix done by Prince Vince. Stern described the remix as \\"nothing but pure sweat and sex (for dinner!)\\". The Dallas Voice's Rich Lopez wrote that the song lacked a strong or memorable hook, but appreciated Raja's decision to experiment with music. He compared it to the early work of Nine Inch Nails and Jeffree Star. Stacy Lambe of BuzzFeed described the single as \\"unexpectedly more gothic\\" than fellow drag queen Sharon Needles' music and \\"club-friendly\\", but criticized the lyrics as a \\"hodgepodge of boasts\\". The single was poorly received by Mark Blankenship of NewNowNext.com, who felt it suffered from a \\"sludgy club beat\\". \\"Diamond Crowned Queen\\" debuted at number fifty on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart on the week of July 2, 2011.

Two remix extended plays (EPs) were released on June 28, 2011, and July 12, 2011. Raja positively responded to Peace's remix, saying that \\"[he] wish [he]’d made it [his] original\\" and he regularly lip- syncs it on tour. A music video, directed by Austin Young, for the original version of the song premiered on June 17, 2011. Raja is shown performing the single in various risqué outfits, such as a pair of white sunglasses and a leopard print body suit. He also appears outside his drag persona. He is seen wearing clown masks and wigs made from plastic and later kissing drag queen Raven. The music video received mostly positive feedback from media commentators. Patrick of Homorazzi.com described the video as a mixture of Lady Gaga, Marilyn Manson, and singer Peter Breeze. It was praised by Mark Blankenship as one of the three fiercest releases by a RuPaul's Drag Race contestant, describing Raja's fashion as \\"slutty-fabulous\\". He commended Raja for \\"challenging us to look, to lust, and then deal with it when shit gets crazy\\". Stacy Lambe positively responded to the video, calling it \\"a mix of amazing visuals with a fun, hardcore dance beat\\". Rich Lopez criticized Raja's decision to appear without drag as breaking the illusion, but he also wrote that \\"Raja creates striking looks that are easy to stare at.\\" Raven's cameo appearance was identified as one of the music video's highlights by Jjannise of Out and a writer from Queer Me Up. Jjannise of Out felt both repulsed and attracted by the image of Raven \\"[p]ainted like Raja's Leather Drag Barbie twin and gazing blankly at the camera\\".

Biography Al-Yazuri was born in Yazur where he later worked as a judge, before traveling to Ramla. When faced with the governor of Ramla, al-Yazuri fled to Cairo and entered service as a eunuch servant to the princess mother of al-Mustansir Billah called Rasad. In 1050, relations between the Fatimids and the Zirid dynasty were strained after the Zirids adopted Sunni Islam and subsequently recognized the Abbasid caliph. In 1052, Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis, ruler of the Zirids, put his own name before the name of the caliph in an official letter and came to the Arab tribes Banu Riyah and Banu Zughba who were plundering Egypt and sent requests for alliances to the tribes of Ifriqiya as well as the Banu Sulaym tribe of Cyrenaica. The Byzantine Empire and Egypt were at peace for some time, and had an agreement to lead each other aid in the event of famine due to lack of wheat in one of the two territories. In 1055, Fatimid exile al-Muayyad fi l-Din Abu Nasr Hibat Allah was able to intercept Byzantine reports that Seljuk sultan Tughril had made a pact with the Greeks against the Fatimids, before coming into contact with the Turkish forces who subsequently promised the help the Fatimid conquest of Baghdad. Shortly after al-Muayyad was sent to Iraq as a Fatimid delegation, and the Fatimid caliph agreed to send troops against Tughril to prevent the conquest of Syria and then Egypt. In 1058, al-Yazuri was arrested and accused of corresponding with Tughril and supporting Fatimid rivals and enemies of the state. He was taken to Tinnis where he was executed.

The plan was originally devised in the 1960s and is updated several times each year. It involves planning from government departments, the Church of England, Metropolitan Police Service, the British Armed Forces, the media, the Royal Parks, London boroughs, the Greater London Authority and Transport for London. Some critical decisions relating to the plan were made by the Queen herself, although some can only be made by her successor (the current heir apparent is her son, Charles, Prince of Wales), after her death. As of early 2017, the phrase \\"London Bridge is down\\" was expected to be used to communicate the death of the Queen to the prime minister of the United Kingdom and key personnel, setting the plan into motion. The codename Operation London Bridge primarily refers to events that would take place in the United Kingdom. In addition to the United Kingdom, other Commonwealth realms where Elizabeth II acts as monarch have developed their own plans for what will happen in the days after her death. These corresponding plans would run concurrently with Operation London Bridge. Background Funerals and coronations for the Royal Household are typically organised by the Earl Marshal and the officers in the College of Heralds. Pre- determined phrases have typically been used as \\"codenames\\" for plans relating to the death and funeral of a royal family member. Initially, codenames were used by key officials in an effort to prevent Buckingham Palace switchboard operators from learning of the death prior to a public announcement. When King George VI died in 1952, key government officials were informed with the phrase \\"Hyde Park Corner\\". Several codenamed funeral plans for royal family members in the late-20th and early 21st century have used the names of prominent bridges in the United Kingdom. Operation Tay Bridge was the phrase used for the death and funeral plans of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and was rehearsed for 22 years before its eventual use in 2002. The funeral plan for Diana, Princess of Wales, was also modelled after Operation Tay Bridge. As of early 2017, the phrase Operation Forth Bridge referred to funeral plans for Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Operation Menai Bridge referred to the funeral plan for Charles, Prince of Wales; and Operation London Bridge referred to the funeral plan for Queen Elizabeth II. Plan The Queen's private secretary will be the first official (i.e., not one of the Queen's relatives or part of a medical team) to convey the news. Their first act will be to contact the prime minister, where civil servants will convey the code phrase \\"London Bridge is down\\" to the prime minister using secure telephone lines. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Global Response Centre, based at a secret location in London, will communicate the news to the governments of the fifteen other countries of which the Queen was the head of state (the Commonwealth realms), and to the governments of the other countries of the Commonwealth of Nations. The media would be informed via an announcement to the Press Association and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) through the Radio Alert Transmission System (RATS) and to commercial radio on the Independent Radio News through a network of blue \\"obit lights\\" which will alert presenters to play \\"inoffensive music\\" and prepare for a news flash, while BBC Two would suspend scheduled programming and switch to BBC One's broadcast of the announcement. BBC News will air a pre-recorded sequence of portraits, during which the presenters on duty at the time will prepare for the formal announcement by putting on dark clothing prepared for this purpose. The Guardian has reported that The Times has eleven days of prepared coverage ready and that ITN and Sky News have long rehearsed her death, but substituting the name \\"Mrs Robinson\\". A footman would pin a dark-edged notice to the gates of Buckingham Palace. At the same time, the palace website would display the same notice. The Parliament of the United Kingdom would be recalled. If possible, it would meet within hours, and the prime minister would address the House of Commons. Local government buildings will fly flags at half-mast and books of condolence may be opened; ceremonial ornaments, such as ceremonial maces or council chains, are to be put in black purses. The day after the Queen's death, the Accession Council would meet at St James's Palace to proclaim the new monarch. Parliament would meet that evening when MPs would swear allegiance to the new monarch. Different arrangements for moving the Queen's coffin are planned depending on where she dies. For example, if the Queen dies at Windsor Castle or Sandringham House, it would be moved by car to Buckingham Palace within a couple of days. If the Queen dies overseas, it would be brought by No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron to RAF Northolt and then by car to Buckingham Palace. If the Queen dies in Scotland (for example, at Holyrood Palace or Balmoral Castle), the coffin would first lie in repose at Holyrood Palace followed by a service of reception at St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh. Following this, the coffin would then be transported to Waverley Station and then taken by the Royal Train to London. In all cases, the coffin would be taken to the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace. Four days after the Queen's death, it would be moved to Westminster Hall and lie in state for four days. The state funeral would be held at Westminster Abbey nine days after the Queen's death, after which her body would be buried in a prepared tomb at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. =Corresponding plans= Officials from Buckingham Palace and Clarence House, known as the Inter-Realm Working Group, have briefed representatives of the Commonwealth realms about the funeral, and succession plans surrounding Operation London Bridge. The governments of the Commonwealth realms will be informed of the death of the monarch from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Global Response Centre. These realms have devised their own plans for what will happen in their respective countries in the days after Elizabeth II's death, which would run concurrently with Operation London Bridge. Australia After the government receives the news, a flag notice will be issued instructing flags to fly at half-mast immediately for the next ten days, except on the day the ascension of the new monarch is proclaimed. After the death of the monarch of Australia, it is expected that the Parliament will meet for a condolence motion. A speech has been drafted for the prime minister. Current plans will see the governor- general of Australia issue the Australian proclamation of the accession of a new monarch at an appropriate ceremony. The Australian Defence Force will organise several gun salutes coinciding with events in London, and will participate in ceremonies in the United Kingdom. The Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom is expected to observe the Accession Council. In addition, Australian members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom are entitled to sit on the Accession Council. Canada In Canada, preparations were made as early as 2002, during the Queen's Golden Jubilee. Consultations over the plans have been made with the Canadian Armed Forces, the Canadian Privy Council Office, the Canadian secretary to the Queen, the office of the governor general of Canada, and the office of the Earl Marshal in the United Kingdom. Government Houses in Canada, such as Rideau Hall, will have black fabric hung on flagpoles and a book of condolences at the front entrance in the event of the Queen's death. Once the government has been informed of the sovereign's death, all staff of the governor-general, provincial lieutenant governors, and territorial commissioners will be immediately issued black ties and black armbands. Government Houses will have portraits of the Queen, and flagpoles draped in black fabric. A book of condolences will be laid out near the front entrance of Government Houses, with events previously planned at the Government Houses cancelled. It is also the governor general's job to recall the Cabinet to Parliament Hill and proclaim that Canada has a new \\"lawful and rightful liege.\\" Upon the death of the sovereign, the Manual of Official Procedure of the Government of Canada states the prime minister is responsible for convening the Parliament, tabling a resolution of loyalty and condolence from the Parliament to the next monarch of Canada, and arranging for the motion to be seconded by the leader of the Official Opposition. The Prime Minister will then move to adjourn Parliament. The Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom is expected to represent Canada at the Accession Council. The Privy Council for Canada will convene to perform the equivalent function of the Accession Council for the Crown in Right of Canada. The death of the sovereign will also be considered a \\"Broadcast of National Importance\\" by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), and a regularly updated plan is maintained. Regular programming would be cancelled, advertisements will be halted, and all CBC television and radio stations will shift to a 24-hour news format. The CBC also has a specially picked on-call squad of broadcasters in the event the sovereign's death occurs during a holiday. New Zealand New Zealand will receive news of the Queen's death via established communication channels between the Royal Household and New Zealand. Once informed, the head of the Ministry for Culture and Heritage will inform a list of government buildings and other facilities to fly the flag of New Zealand at half-mast. Twenty-one gun salutes will also be ordered \\"at appropriate times.\\" A state memorial service is expected, although decisions on accompanying events, as well as government protocol will be determined by the prime minister. Radio New Zealand (RNZ), the state-radio broadcaster, has a set of guidelines and instructions in the event of the death of the monarch of New Zealand. Across all RNZ stations, broadcasters will break regular programming to announce the death of the Queen, with rolling coverage to begin when ready. RNZ stations are instructed not to play punk music, or songs by the band Queen during this period.

Begun by three business partners, the company set up its manufacturing facilities in what is today the Arena District producing inexpensive buggies and dashboards, and quickly saw success. At its height it employed 1,200 people and was producing 100 buggies a day which were sold in every state in the United States. The company was one of the city's major employers and a significant portion of the city's buggy manufacturing economy. After the turn of the century it oriented itself toward production of electric vehicles and, later, of automobiles. Crippled by the Great Flood of 1913 and unable to compete with cheaper alternatives like the Model T, the company eventually went bankrupt in 1913, reorganized, and closed its doors a few years later. It influenced the early automobile industry production methods and several notable employees, including Eddie Rickenbacker and Harvey S. Firestone. The company buildings, after some time empty, have since been re- developed as office space in the Arena District.  History  = Origin = A drawing of the first home of the Iron Buggy Co., the predecessor of the Columbus Buggy Co., at 180 North High Street in Columbus. The Columbus Buggy Company was established by entrepreneur Clinton D. Firestone and brothers George and Oscar Peters. The three partners saw Columbus, Ohio as a ripe location for a business thanks to cheap labor as well as the recent network of railroads created during the American Civil War reducing the costs of goods. The completion of the Hocking Valley Railway also granted them ample access to coal, wood and iron from southeast Ohio. Before starting the company, the Peters brothers had worked in the leather trade, but had developed a process to produce cheap buggies for close to $150 apiece, using wood obtained from a company near the Ohio Penitentiary and building using a specialized manufacturing system. Before 1870 they produced 100 and sold them successfully at auction, though their business partners refused further work, leaving them in debt. In 1870, they were introduced to Firestone, a native of Canton, Ohio and who had operated a railroad business in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, moved to Columbus and financed the business with $5,000. Their first venture, Iron Buggy Company, launched in 1870 in a shanty built for $100, at 180 North High Street and focused it on selling cheap buggies. The business saw immediate success thanks to a design created by the Peters brothers and a system of labor that made production efficient, and it sold 237 buggies in its first year. The building it was housed in burnt down on May 27, 1874 and was rebuilt. In 1875 its owners sold the business to another buggy producer, H. K. Tuller of Buckeye Buggy Company. = Success = In 1875, the three formed the Columbus Buggy Company and Peters Dash Company, with $20,000 in capital. Its first facility was locating at Wall and Locust streets near the modern day One Nationwide Plaza building in the Arena District, immediately north of downtown Columbus, and near the Ohio Penitentiary and Union Station. His business specialized in making buggies that were affordable to people at all price ranges as well as dashboards, carriage fenders, washes and straps for carriage dealers and manufacturers. The company quickly saw success, drawing $50,000 in revenue in its first year, but sales quickly grew. By 1878 it had 250 employees and was making 100 buggies a week. In 1883, the company had 1,000 employees and was producing 25,000 buggies a year. That year it was struck with a patent infringement lawsuit from Timken Company, alleging the company had stolen the idea for an \\"automatic\\" spring part used in its carriages, and seeking $50,000 in damages. Columbus Buggy Co. filed a countersuit and the two businesses traded barbs in trade publications for two months before the courts decided in Studebaker's favor in December 1884. Columbus Buggy Co. was obliged to pay $3,000 in damages, though it began to use Timken springs in models starting in 1886, and the Timken and Firestone families maintained a friendly relationship during and after the litigation. The company continued to add buildings as it continued to expand along High Street until it became the largest manufacturer of buggies in the world. By 1888 it occupied an entire city block between High Street and Wall Street. In 1890 it pledged $5,000 to the creation of a YMCA building in downtown Columbus. In the meantime, it began advertising its vehicles and dash products heavily in magazines. At its height in 1892, the company employed 1,200 people and built 100 vehicles and 1,500 carriage dashboards a day, with its products exported to other countries around the world. Its revenue grew to $2 million a year on an active capital of about $1 million and about $300,000 a month in payroll. The company had a presence at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, where it boasted that it had dealerships in every state and shipped overseas. By that year, though, its buggies, which sold for $110, were considered overpriced. By 1900, about two dozen other buggy producers had formed around Columbus, with factories working day and night in the city, and an estimated one in six buggies in use around the world was built in Columbus. Some of these companies were older than Columbus Buggy Co, but the manufacturer remained one of the largest businesses in the city. Columbus Buggy Co. moved its production to a new plant at 400 Dublin Road in 1906 at Firestone's insistence. = Branching into automobiles = 1906 Columbus Electric Automobile An advertisement for a 1911 \\"Mechanical Greyhound\\" automobile produced by Columbus Buggy Co. With the advent of the automobile, Columbus Buggy Co. found itself at a competitive disadvantage to companies in Detroit, Cleveland and Chicago, which had a greater access to steel. In 1903, though, it opted to produce an electric vehicle to compete with these new and increasingly popular vehicles. The 400 Dublin Road facility began producing its first electric coupe in 1903, the Columbus Electric Model No. 1000. This would be one of several models of electric vehicle the company produced in larger scale beginning in 1905. The company advertised the vehicles as easy to operate, targeting women, and that they were quiet. But the vehicles were limited by a top speed of , limited range and a need to recharge batteries for several hours. Powered by Willard batteries, this car sold for about $1,000. It produced several models including the No. 3003 Firestone Motor Buggy: a light motor buggy, which it also marketed to physicians as a medical phaeton, as well as the Columbus Station Wagon No. 1102, which was to be driven by a chauffeur while its passengers rode in an enclosed compartment. In 1907, it bought the Springfield Automotive Company of Springfield, Ohio which had been manufacturing the Bramwell, a gasoline powered automobile. In 1909, the company hired Lee Frayer to design a full- sized car, with Eddie Rickenbacker as his assistant. The Firestone-Columbus, a gasoline-powered car geared toward families, began production in 1909. About 500 of the vehicles sold in the first year and it was generally well received in the market. Improvements were made to the vehicles continually as they were produced, as opposed to creating successive model years. There were a few different variations on the vehicle, including the model 76-A, an intermediate sized vehicle that could carry four passengers. The Columbus-Firestone was reported to be the first car with its steering wheel on the left side of the car. Introduced at the 1909 Chicago Auto Show, it became popular and sold 2,000 units a year, all made at the 400 Dublin Road plant. By 1912 there were more cars of this brand than any other in Columbus and the company was producing 2,000 a year. But it also struggled to compete with cheaper competitors, notably the Ford Model T. The company built a special racing buggy, the Red Wing, which it entered into the 1911 Indianapolis 500, designed by Frayer and Rickenbacker and driven by Frayer. Though the car didn't finish the race, it was credited with finishing 13th in the race. They subsequently entered a car into the 1912 Indianapolis 500, this time driven by Rickenbacker. It finished 21st. = Decline = The business was affected by the severe flooding of local rivers during the Great Flood of 1913 and it this damaged the business sufficiently for it to declare bankruptcy, with the company $624,000 in debt. Initially it was offered for sale for 25 cents on the dollar, but received only one offer, for less than $100,000, prompting its interests, headed by Frank L. Chase, to withdraw the offer. Under an order from a federal judge, $273,000, or 44 percent of the debt, was eventually paid to creditors. In 1914, a new entity, named the New Columbus Buggy Co., was incorporated with $500,000 in capital under a new ownership group, including C. A. Finnegan and E. D. Hoefeller of Buffalo, New York. This entity, controlled by the company's creditors, continued production at the plant. That same year, Firestone passed away. Both the Firestone Electric and the Columbus-Firestone vehicle lines were produced into 1915, when the company ceased operations, leaving an inventory of 35 new electric cars and 12 automobiles, as well as several used cars. Following the closure of the Columbus Buggy Co. The Allen Motor Co. of Fostoria, Ohio leased the plant and built automobiles there before closing in 1923. The building itself was home to Janitrol Corp. before being redeveloped as the Buggyworks building in the 1990s.  Legacy  Harvey S. Firestone was a salesman for Columbus Buggy Co. before he launched his own company, Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., in 1900. The company played a key role in shaping the early history of the automobile. Its manufacturing processes for efficiently producing vehicles were notable and ahead of many companies of its time. The success of the business brought attention to C. D. Firestone, who became a prominent figure in the carriage industry and he became president of the Carriage Builders National Association in 1888. Several of the company's employees rose to great prominence in the industry. Clinton Firestone's cousin, Harvey S. Firestone, was a salesmen for the company. During his time as a salesman, and racing buggies through the streets of Detroit, Michigan, Clinton Firestone met Henry Ford, who helped him obtain tires for custom-built racing carriages. Firestone, seeing the advantage of the buggies' thick rubber tires, left the company and in 1900 founded the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Akron to produce rubber tires for carriages and buggies. By 1904, it was the largest tire manufacturer in the world. Eddie Rickenbacker joined the company at the age of 17, and he quickly became an engineer and troubleshooter, dispatched to help owners when they had problems with their vehicles, and his service increased the reputation of the business among its owners. It was during this assignment that Rickenbacker, while serving as a test driver for the vehicles, developed an affinity for driving fast cars. Some of the original sales catalog promotional material of the company are still preserved in the Henry Ford Museum. = Buggyworks complex = The company's original buildings north of downtown Columbus were redeveloped as part of a larger revival of the industrial area north of Columbus — by then termed the Arena District — following the construction of Nationwide Arena. Nationwide Realty Investors, a development affiliate of Nationwide Insurance, acquired two of the production facilities at 390 and 400 W. Nationwide Blvd., termed the \\"Buggyworks,\\" and redeveloped them into 145,000 square feet of office space. The development project cost $10.5 million. The office buildings attracted a number of tenants, the first being Cameron Mitchell Restaurants. Another portion of the complex at 440 W. Nationwide Blvd., was redeveloped into loft condominiums.

He specialised in steeplechases over the minimum distance of two miles and was a confirmed front-runner who usually attempted to lead from the start. He scored his first major success in 2013 when he won the Maghull Novices' Chase and went on to win the Celebration Chase in 2015 and two editions of the Desert Orchid Chase. In March 2017 he recorded his biggest success when he took the Queen Mother Champion Chase at the fourth attempt. He was euthanized after sustaining an injury in the 2019 Dublin Chase at Leopardstown. Background Special Tiara was a bay gelding with no white markings bred in England by his owner David Young. He was sent into training with Henry de Bromhead at Knockeen, County Waterford. Special Tiara was sired by Kayf Tara, an outstanding stayer who won two Ascot Gold Cups and two Irish St Legers and was a three time Cartier Champion Stayer. His other offspring have included Thistlecrack, Planet of Sound (Punchestown Gold Cup), Blaklion (RSA Chase), Tea For Two (Feltham Novices' Chase) and Carruthers (Hennessy Gold Cup). Special Tiara's dam Special Choice was an unraced, Irish-bred, daughter of Bob Back and a member of the relatively obscure Thoroughbred family 4-e. Racing career =2011/2012 National Hunt season= Special Tiara began his racing career on the amateur Point-to-point circuit, finishing second at the Boulta meeting on 27 November 2011. He then moved to professional competition and was campaigned in novice hurdle races. He finished second at Killarney in May and Clonmel in June before recording his first success at Kilbeggan Racecourse in July, beating Tobar Na Gaoise by five lengths. =2012/2013 National Hunt season= In the 2012/2013 season Special Tiara was campaigned in novice chases and made a successful debut over fences when winning at Ballinrobe on 24 September. Sally Rowley-Williams then purchased him and nicknamed him \\"Mr T\\", believing this name was more suited to his physique and personality. When moved up in class he finished second to Baily Green in the Grade 3 Buck House Novice Chase at Punchestown in October. After a lengthy break he returned at Leopardstown Racecourse on 3 March and finished fifth of the six runners behind Savello. On 6 April Special Tiara was sent to England to contest the Grade 1 Maghull Novices' Chase at Aintree Racecourse and started the 28/1 outsider in a six-runner field. The Grand Annual Chase winner Alderwood started favourite ahead of Baily Green, Overturn and Sire de Grugy. Ridden by Bryan Cooper he led early in the race before settling in second behind Overturn. He moved up to challenge the leader at the final fence, took the lead on the run-in and won by one and three quarter lengths. Nineteen days later he lined up for the Ryanair Novice Chase at Punchestown, but after leading for most of the way he was overtaken four fences out and finished a distant third behind Arvika Ligeonniere and Ocars Well. =2013/2014 National Hunt season= After unseating his rider on his seasonal debut Special Tiara finished third to Kid Cassidy in the Shloer Chase in November on his first appearance at Cheltenham Racecourse. In February at Punchestown he finished last of four behind Arvika Ligeonniere in the Tied Cottage Chase. At the Cheltenham Festival on 12 March he made his first attempt to win the Queen Mother Champion Chase and led for most of the way before fading from the third last and finishing sixth behind Sire de Grugy. In the Celebration Chase at Sandown Park Racecourse in April he produced probably his best effort of the season as he finished third to Sire de Grugy and Pepite Rose. In the summer of 2014 he made one start under Flat racing rules and finished second to the Aidan O'Brien-trained three-year-old Tigris River at Killarney. =2014/2015 National Hunt season= Special Tiara was beaten at odds-on on his first two starts of the 2014/2015 season, finishing fifth in a hurdle at Cork and third in a steeplechase at Ballinrobe. After running fourth to Twinlight in the Fortria Chase at Navan Racecourse he was sent to England to contest the Desert Orchid Chase at Kempton Park on 27 December. Ridden by Barry Geraghty he started the 5/1 third choice in the betting behind Balder Succes (Maghull Novices Chase) and Hinterland (Henry VIII Novices' Chase). He went to the front from the start as usual, built up a clear advantage and held on over the last two fences to win by two and a quarter lengths from Balder Succes. The gelding then made his second bid for the Queen Mother Champion Chase in March and improved on his 2014 effort as he finished third behind Dodging Bullets and Somersby with Sire de Grugy fourth, Sizing Europe seventh and the favourite Sprinter Sacre pulled-up. The 2015 edition of the Celebration Chase on 25 April saw Special Tiara, ridden by Noel Fehily start the 3/1 favourite ahead of Sprinter Sacre, Mr Mole (Game Spirit Chase), Somersby, God's Own (Ryanair Novice Chase) and Vibrato Valtat (Henry VIII Novices' Chase). Although he was briefly led by Mr Mole, Special Tiara made most of the running, went clear of the field approaching the penultimate fence, and won by six lengths from Sprinter Sacre. =2015/2016 National Hunt season= Special Tiara began his 2015/2016 campaign with a poor effort in the Fortria Chase, but returned to form at Sandown in December when he finished three quarters of a length second to Sire de Grugy in the Tingle Creek Chase after being hampered at the final fence. Another attempt at the Queen Mother Champion Chase saw him finish third for the second consecutive year as he was beaten three and a half lengths and a nose by Sprinter Sacre and Un de Sceaux. On his only other run of the season he faded badly in the closing stages and came home last of the six finishers behind God' Own in the Punchestown Champion Chase. =2016/2017 National Hunt season= On his first appearance of the 2016/2017 season Special Tiara started favourite for the Cheltenham Chase but tired after the second last and finished a distant third behind Fox Norton and Simply Ned. The gelding was without a win in twenty months when he appeared at Kempton on 27 December and attempted to repeat his 2014 success in the Desert Orchid Chase and was made the 8/11 favourite. His task was made considerably easier when his chief rival in the betting, Sire de Grugy fell at the second fence. He led from the start and was never headed, holding off the sustained challenge of the Haldon Gold Cup winner Sir Valentino to win by half a length. In the Clarence House Chase at Cheltenham on 28 January he led for ten fences but then tired and came home last of the six finishers behind Un de Sceaux. On 15 March 2017 Special Tiara lined up for the fourth time in the Queen Mother Champion Chase in which he was sent off at odds of 11/1 in a ten-runner field. His old rivals God's Own, Fox Norton, Don Valentino and Simply Ned were again in opposition but the overwhelming favourite was Douvan who went off at odds of 2/9 after winning his last fourteen races. After taking the lead at the second fence, Special Tiara, ridden by Fehily, established a clear advantage over the field and jumped the last two lengths in front. Fox Norton launched a strong challenge on the run-in but Special Tiara \\"held on gamely\\" and won by a head. There was a gap of six lengths back to Sir Valentino in third while Douvan finished lame in seventh. After the race Fehily said \\"I got into a great rhythm down the back straight and my horse jumped better than he has ever done before. He’s a wonderful horse and deserved that because he’s been knocking on the door a few times. It’s difficult to make all in the Champion Chase, especially going at that speed, and you’re worried you’re a sitting target for something else. When I jumped the ditch at the top of the hill, I thought Douvan might come past me but I didn’t think anything else would\\".

Mary inherited the Gairbraid Estate from her father, Hew Hill, who had no surviving male heirs. In 1763, she married Robert Graham. Generally spoken of as Captain Graham, Robert had been captured by the pirates of Algiers and was their prisoner for some time, being treated as a slave. On his return home there was considerable interest in his adventures and it was said that Mary was so impressed by his romantic story that she chose him for her husband. Mary and Robert lived in Gairbraid House overlooking the River Kelvin. The original was built in 1688, but they replaced it one hundred years later when contemporaries described it as “a square house built by a square man”. It was demolished in the 1920s. The Grahams ran into money troubles after speculating in coal-mining for which their land proved to be too damp. However, these were reversed when parliament approved the planning of the route of the Forth and Clyde Canal in 1768, which went through the estate. They were compensated for this and once the canal was completed, around 1790, their land along the canal suddenly became much more valuable. A village began to grow up and the Grahams feued more land for its development “from Glasgow to Garscube Bridge” with the condition that it would be “in all times called the town of Mary Hill”. Mary and Robert had no male heirs either and their unmarried older daughter, Lilias, inherited the estate on Mary’s death. Their younger daughter, Janet, married Alexander Dunlop, a merchant in Greenock, and when Lilias died in 1836 it passed to their son, John Dunlop, who disposed of much of it.

A native of Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy, he participated in scientific expeditions sponsored by the Cleveland Museum of Natural History and the American Museum of Natural History. By encouraging John Sterling Rockefeller to purchase Kent Island as a bird sanctuary in 1930, he was instrumental in the revival of the Bay of Fundy common eider population. His taxidermy collection of over 300 birds, all mounted by his grandfather, father, or himself and now displayed in the Grand Manan Museum, is one of the largest in Canada. Family and early life Moses was born on the island of Grand Manan in 1881, the second of three children in his family. His father and grandfather were both taxidermists who collected and mounted birds as a hobby. His grandfather, John Thomas Chiselden Moses, was born in England, where he learned taxidermy before emigrating to Canada as a young man. He later lived in Maine and finally settled in the village of North Head in 1872 with his wife and several of their ten children. He compiled a list of Grand Manan birds for a book published in 1876, in which he was described as \\"our Grand Manan ornithologist\\", who \\"makes birds his specialty and his pastime\\". John Thomas Moses died in 1885. His son John Russell Moses, born in 1853, was Allan Moses's father. John Russell Moses learned taxidermy from his father and continued to build the family collection of mounted bird specimens, while prospering as a businessman. He was one of Grand Manan's major fish buyers, with a processing plant in North Head. Part of his business was selling the dried swim bladders of hake for the manufacture of isinglass. This was highly profitable, as the bladders were an otherwise useless by-product of processing. John Russell taught his taxidermy skills to his son, Allan, and to his daughter Sarah, Allan's older sister. Allan Moses left school early and worked in his father's fish plant before becoming a fisherman himself. Sarah, who wrote for local newspapers under the name Sarah E. M. Smith, dealt with her father's business and natural history related correspondence and later helped Allan with his scientific reports and edited his travel journals for publication. The albatross Grey-headed albatrossOn August 1, 1913 a Grand Manan fisherman named Ernest Joy shot a large seabird near Machias Seal Island. He did not recognize the bird and took it to Allan Moses, who identified it as a Grey-headed albatross, a bird normally found in the Southern Ocean. It was to be the first of its species ever recorded in the American Ornithologists' Union's Checklist of North American Birds. Joy gave the albatross to Moses, who prepared a study skin from it. The American ornithologist Leonard Cutler Sanford made two visits to Grand Manan, attempting to purchase the specimen for the American Museum of Natural History. For several years Moses refused to sell it, but eventually agreed to donate it to the museum in return for a chance to take part in a future scientific expedition. Cleveland Museum expedition Moses spent the summer of 1923 in Labrador as a warden, enforcing the recently enacted Migratory Birds Convention Act. While there, he was invited by the Cleveland Museum of Natural History to join a collecting expedition to the South Atlantic. Moses was one of two taxidermists and collectors on the expedition, which left Long Island in November 1923 on board a three-masted schooner called the Blossom. They spent five months in the Cape Verde Islands, where Moses collected birds on eight of the ten islands and made about 800 study skins. The expedition then went on to Africa, arriving in Dakar in May 1924 and spending another five months there before returning to Cape Verde and then sailing to the island of Trindade, where they arrived in December 1924. From there they sailed to Rio de Janeiro, where Moses left the expedition, arriving back on Grand Manan in April 1925. American Museum of Natural History expedition In 1928 and 1929 Moses served as the taxidermist on an ornithological expedition to Tanganyika and Belgian Congo to collect specimens for the American Museum of Natural History. The expedition was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and led by John Sterling Rockefeller, along with Rockefeller's friend and Yale University classmate Charles B. G. Murphy. Their main goal was to find and collect the rare Grauer's broadbill, which was known only by one 1908 specimen in the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum in England, and which had eluded collectors for twenty years. They arrived in Dar es Salaam in August 1928 by steamer after a voyage through the Red Sea and down the east coast of Africa. On July 26, 1929, in a mountainous area at the northern end of Lake Tanganyika, Moses was the first to find and shoot a Grauer's broadbill. The party collected several more broadbill specimens and spent a further three months collecting before travelling down the Congo River to the port of Boma. Moses arrived back in Grand Manan in January 1930. Kent Island Rockefeller held Moses in high regard and wanted to repay him personally for his work on the expedition, and particularly for collecting the first Grauer's broadbill. Moses suggested that Rockefeller buy a group of three small islands in the Bay of Fundy near Grand Manan and make them a bird sanctuary. By doing so, he could protect the eider ducks which nested there, and whose numbers had been declining seriously for several years until there were estimated to be at most 30 breeding pairs from the Gulf of Maine southward along the Atlantic Coast. Most of these nested on Kent Island, one of the three islands in question. Eider nestRockefeller agreed and authorized Moses, working through a local agent, to purchase the islands on his behalf, keeping the real buyer's name a secret in order to keep the price down. The owner of Kent Island, the largest of the three, sold it for $25,000, but the owner of the two smaller, Hay and Sheep Islands, refused to sell. He was a fisherman who continued to live on Hay Island. However, he agreed to allow access to his property for \\"scientific purposes\\", such as counting nests. Rockefeller hired two resident wardens for Kent Island, Moses himself and Ralph Griffin of Grand Manan. Each received an annual salary of $1000. They moved to the island in June 1930. Over the succeeding years, the eider population increased dramatically, reaching several hundred nesting pairs by 1935. In 1934, after visits to Kent Island by scientists including Ernst Mayr and Alfred O. Gross of Bowdoin College, Rockefeller decided to donate the island to Bowdoin College as a research station in exchange for the college's commitment to maintain it as a bird sanctuary. Moses left Kent Island and returned to his home in North Head in 1935. Later life His father died in 1936 and Moses sold the fish plant. Also in 1936, he married Mabel Claire Kent, a widow who had, with her late husband, owned the Marathon Hotel in North Head. Moses continued collecting professionally for natural history museums and adding to the collection of taxidermy birds begun by his grandfather and built up over three generations. It was housed in a separate building near his home and was known as the Moses Museum. In 1951 he donated the collection to the community of Grand Manan as a \\"gift to all present and future students of natural history\\". It was moved to the recently opened Grand Manan High School in the village of Grand Harbour, where it was named the Moses Memorial Museum of Natural History. Allan Moses died in hospital on Grand Manan on 23 March 1953. Legacy In 1967 the taxidermy collection of over 300 specimens was moved to the new Grand Manan Museum, where it became the museum's \\"feature exhibit\\". Now known as the Allan Moses Bird Collection, it is one of the largest in Canada. By influencing Rockefeller to purchase Kent Island as a bird sanctuary, Moses made possible the revival of the dwindling eider population. By the same act, he was instrumental in Bowdoin College's eventual acquisition of a field station in the Bay of Fundy. By 2008 research done on Kent Island had resulted in over 190 published scientific papers.

Hughes was carrying 535 letters, one to each member of Congress, protesting what he referred to as bipartisan corruption and dysfunctional government. He surrendered peacefully after landing to the Capitol Police.Former mailman Doug Hughes gets 4 months in prison for gyrocopter protest at U.S. Capitol (w/video): Gyrocopter reformer to be sentenced, Tampa Bay Times (April 22, 2016). Hughes was later charged with six crimes. Hughes pleaded guilty in November 2015 to one felony and was sentenced to 120 days plus one year of probation. Biography  =Early life= Hughes was born in San Mateo County, California, and grew up in Santa Cruz. He graduated from Holy Cross High School in Santa Cruz and enlisted in the U.S. Navy, serving aboard the USS Enterprise as an electrician's mate third class.Calvin Men, Gyrocopter pilot who landed in nation's Capitol has Santa Cruz roots, Santa Cruz Sentinel (April 16, 2015). A U.S. Postal Service official said that Hughes had become a rural letter carrier in 2003.Alexandra Jaffe, Man taken into custody after landing single-person aircraft on Capitol grounds, CNN (April 15, 2015). =Gyrocopter flight= Hughes was deeply affected by the suicide of his son, John, in August 2012. Hughes told the Tampa Bay Times that his protest had been a response to this, suggesting that his son had, \\"paid far too high a price for an unimportant issue, but if you're willing to take a risk, the ultimate risk, to draw attention to something that does have significance, it's worth doing.\\" According to Hughes, his intent was to deliver a political message by \\"delivering the mail.\\" Hughes carried 535 letters to Congress, individually stamped and addressed to each member of Congress. The flight was broadcast over the Internet to Hughes' web site \\"The Democracy Club\\". The flight from a small airport in Gettysburg, PA across Maryland finished on the west lawn of the US Capitol Building - a distance of about 70 miles and total flight time just under 90 minutes. In 2014, Hughes contacted a writer with the Tampa Bay Times to explain his non- violent protest. Interviews and video, including flight video, were arranged in advance with the understanding the story would be posted online at the Times web site as soon as the flight began. The reporter was in Washington DC and saw the take-off on Hughes' web site. At the time Hughes began the flight, an E-mail to the government through barackobama.com was sent automatically which explained the intent of the flight and where it was going. Dozens of emails were sent to the media directing them to the Tampa Bay Times web site for the story and the Hughes web site for the background. A few weeks after the flight, the Chairman of the US House Oversight Committee in an official hearing on the gyrocopter flight said, \\"The guy in the gyrocopter was livefeeding a stream. I have heard a story from one of the major networks where they were watching it in New York, called down to the Capitol, and had staff reporters and producers go down on the grass to watch it happen.\\" Seventeen months before the flight, Hughes was interviewed by the US Secret Service. In October 2013, he admitted to the US Secret Service owning a gyrocopter and identified where it was located but did not admit to specific plans for the flight. Hughes claimed this encounter with the federal police validated his non-violent inclination. In the letter to the government sent at the time of take-off and to the media, Hughes declared the investigation by the US Secret Service and lack of action by the authorities was proof that his non-violent political intent had been established in advance of the flight. Following his return to Florida, Hughes did a number of interviews from his home while under house arrest. These included interviews on \\"Good Morning America\\", \\"Hannity,\\" and Democracy Now,\\" among others. In the interviews Hughes argued for the need to reverse the Supreme Court decision, \\"Citizens United and reduce the influence of wealth on American politics. Hughes flight triggered media discussion on the subject of money in politics. In an editorial for Huffingtonpost, John Ennis presented asked, \\"what other recourse did he have?\\" while Jon Stewart declared \\"Kudos to that guy!\\" after dubbing the incident \\"Wack Hawk Down\\". The co-founder of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, Ben Cohen, wrote an editorial supporting Hughes' flight as a legitimate act of civil disobedience. Other political personalities, including Ralph Nader and former representatives Connie Morella (R-MD) and Dan Glickman (D-KS) teamed up to write an editorial \\"We Are Gyrocopter,\\" which decried \\"special interest\\" and \\"corrosive big money's\\" influence on American politics. Hughes also faced strong criticism for the flight. Representative Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) said that Hughes was \\"lucky to be alive\\" and \\"should have been blown out of the air,\\" while broadcaster Anderson Cooper expressed concern over the tax dollars that would be spent in law enforcement and prosecution for Hughes' 'stunt'. The US Postal Service was unhappy with Hughes' flight. His gyrocopter had carried the US Postal logo, and the Post Office determined that the use of two small corrugated trays to transport mail was misappropriation of government property. Hughes was suspended after the flight and fired in July 2015. He appealed the decision and retired in 2016.  Impact  The gyrocopter flight inspired art in a variety of venues. Soon after the flight, street art depicting the flight showed up in LA. Two different songs were written, \\"Ballad of Doug Hughes\\" by Paul Loether and \\"Superhero Autogyro\\" by Curtis Long. An award-winning video, \\"An American Mailman's Flight for Freedom\\" was produced by Joseph Huff-Hannon. In his last few weeks before retirement, David Letterman hosted President Obama and delivered the \\"Top 10 Questions Dumb Guys Ask the President\\". Number One, was the gyrocopter pilot purportedly asking the Chief Executive: \\"When will you return my gyrocopter?\\" Unknown pranksters announced the \\"Doug Hughes Commemorative Postal Stamp\\" to the press through a parody web site with a convincing photo of postal executives outside the US Postal Museum making the announcement. Exactly a year after the Hughes flight, a march from Philadelphia to the US Capitol kicked off a week of peaceful civil disobedience. In the protest dubbed \\"Democracy Spring\\" over 1300 arrests were made at the Capitol Building in a protest of \\"Citizens United\\". Hughes had little direct influence in \\"Democracy Spring\\", organized by 99Rise, which Hughes could not attend by court order but his influence was present. Among the groups supporting \\"Democracy Spring\\" was \\"Code Pink\\", the women's peace group. Media Benjamin, co-founder of \\"Code Pink\\" said of the assembly of thousands: \\"I think it's fair to say that this is his [Doug Hughes] baby.\\" Exactly two years after the flight Doug Hughes mailed the letters to Congress, conventionally at the Post Office he previously worked at. The letters had been impounded as evidence - Hughes recovered them after he finished his prison term. Within the limits of his probation, which limits his travel, he is active with other leaders in the movement to get big money out of politics. Federal authorities announced in October 2016 they would destroy the gyrocopter which Hughes was required to forfeit in the plea agreement. = Later life = Hughes finished his prison term in October 2016, then remained under federal probation until October 2017. Retired from the US Postal Service, he is reportedly engaged in writing a book and giving speeches. When probation finished he intended to return to national activism on the corrosive effect of big money in politics and the reform measures he believes are possible and effective.

From January 1999 to December 2004, she was a member of the Archbishops' Council, the central executive body of the Church of England. Early life and education Ozanne grew up in Guernsey, in a conservative and religious environment. She studied mathematics at St John's College, Cambridge, where she was one of the former all-male college's first female undergraduates. Church activism In 2014, Ozanne decided to become more publicly engaged with the sexuality debate within the Church. In 2015, she was elected back onto the Church of England's General Synod. She has since been heavily involved in campaigning for equal rights for the LGBTI community. She has been decided as \\"one of the Church of England's most influential evangelical campaigners\\". Ozanne has called for the anti-homosexual verses in The Bible to be looked at again. She believes that they have been misinterpreted, stating \\"Until William Wilberforce came along, many evangelicals fundamentally believed it was right to treat black people as slaves.\\" Personal life Having previously believed that being Christian and being gay was not compatible, Ozanne sought a deliverance ministry and underwent an exorcism. She also lived a celibate lifestyle, refraining from any sexual relationship. At the age of 28, having struggled with depression due to her repressed sexuality, she had a nervous breakdown which resulted in her being admitted to hospital. In 2009, after years of personal struggle as an evangelical Christian trying to reconcile her faith with her sexuality, Jayne came out as gay to her friends and family.

Early life  Graham was the eldest daughter of Robert and Mary Graham (née Hill). Her mother owned the Gairbraid estate (now the area of Glasgow known as Maryhill), which she inherited from her father, Hew Hill. Lilias had one sibling, a younger sister named Janet, who married Greenock merchant Alexander Dunlop. Their son, John Dunlop, went on to inherit the Gairbraid estate upon his aunt's death in 1836.  Temperance movement  She is credited with helping to form the first temperance movement in Scotland alongside her nephew John Dunlop and her companion Betsy Allan. Dunlop was inspired to establish British Temperance Societies in Greenock and Maryhill in 1829 after becoming aware of the differences between Scotland and other parts of Europe in attitudes towards alcohol. Alexander Thomson wrote: > \\"In a recent visit to France, Mr Dunlop had been struck with the sobriety > which seemed to prevail there amongst all classes; and he could not help > contrasting this state of matters with the painful scenes that might be > witnessed daily among his own countrymen.\\" Despite facing initial hostility and ridicule, Dunlop persisted in spreading the message of abstinence from alcohol throughout Scotland, and formed Britain's first temperance society in Gairbraid on 1 October 1829.

Amateur wrestling career  Prior to becoming a professional wrestler, Kitamura was a highly accomplished amateur wrestler, known for being one of the largest wrestlers in all of Japan. Because of his size and physique, he earned the nickname \\"Wrestling Monster\\". He attended Senshu University, where he was a part of their wrestling team. In 2006, he won the All Japan Wrestling Championship in the 120 kg category, and later on in the same year represented Japan in the World Championships. Throughout his amateur career, Kitamura would go on to win three national championships and represent Japan on a global level twice. As well as amateur wrestling, Kitamura took part in the 2015 Ganryū-jima fighting tournament, where he defeated a Mongolian Sumo wrestler. = Steroids and ban = On June 13, 2011, Kitamura was banned from amateur wrestling for two years after testing positive for anabolic steroids, specifically, the illegal muscle building drug drostanolone. Kitamura was being tipped as a possible member of Japan's Olympic wrestling team for the 2012 London Olympic Games, but the ban ruled him out of participation. He did not appeal against the ban, but said that he \\"took them by accident after buying some supplements from abroad\\".  Professional wrestling career  =New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2015–2019)= Kitamura began training in the New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) dojo in 2015. His first match in NJPW was not a traditional professional wrestling match, but rather a dark amateur wrestling exhibition at Lion's Gate Project 1, where he wrestled fellow trainee Tomoyuki Oka to a time limit draw. After undergoing further training, Kitamura wrestled his first ever professional match on September 1, 2016, at Lion's Gate Project 3, another dark match where he and Oka once again wrestled to a draw. On March 13, 2017, he made his televised debut, teaming with Oka in a loss to the Guerrillas of Destiny (Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa). The following day, Kitamura teamed with Katsuyori Shibata and Yuji Nagata in a loss to TenCozy (Satoshi Kojima and Hiroyoshi Tenzan) and Juice Robinson. The day after that, he once again lost to Tonga and Loa, this time teaming with Nagata. On June 24, 2017, three months after his debut, Kitamura won the first match in his career when he teamed with Tomoyuki Oka to defeat Manabu Nakanishi and Tetsuhiro Yagi in a tag match. Kitamura and Oka continued teaming regularly, eventually dubbing their team \\"Monster Rage\\". At the end of 2017, Kitamura took part in two tournaments held by NJPW; the 2017 World Tag League and the 2017 Young Lion Cup. In the World Tag League, Kitamura and fellow young lion David Finlay finished last in their block after losing all seven of their matches. Meanwhile, in the Young Lion Cup, Kitamura emerged victorious after winning all five of his matches. On January 5th at New Year's Dash, Katsuya began a Seven Trial series of matches where he would face seven different wrestlers. He lost his first of seven matches to Jay White at New Year Dash. At the New Beginning in Saporro he lost his second match of seven to Michael Elgin and his third the following day to Juice Robinson. At the Road to The New Beginning event from Korakuen Hall he lost his fourth match against Hiroyoshi Tenzan, and the fifth against Manabu Nakanishi. At The New Beginning in Osaka on February 10, he lost match #6 against Yuji Nagata. At The New Beginning in Hiroshima he was scheduled to face Manabu Nakanishi, but he suffered a cerebral concussion and was unable to compete. It was reported that the severity of the injury may force him to retire. After almost a year with little news or updates on his condition, Kitamura left NJPW on January 31, 2019.

Education and early life Born in Warsaw, Poland, Mazo migrated to the United States as a small child with his parents, Sonia and George Mazo. The Mazos settled in Charleston, South Carolina where they lived in the Hannah Enston Building. Mazo would later graduate from Clemson University. During World War II, he served as a public relations officer with the U.S. Army Air Force's 385th Bomb Group and was stationed in the United Kingdom. Career Mazo reported for Stars and Stripes, the New York Herald Tribune, the New York Times, the Reader's Digest, and served for one year during the presidency of Harry Truman as a deputy assistant secretary of defense. In later life, Mazo was employed as head of the professional staff of the United States Congress Joint Committee on Printing. In 1959, Mazo authored a biography of Richard Nixon, Richard Nixon: A Political and Personal Portrait. The following year, he published a series of exposés on serious voter fraud in the United States which, he believed, cost Nixon the 1960 U.S. presidential election. His reports prompted a successful appeal by Nixon to Mazo's editors to terminate the series of stories on the grounds that the U.S. could not afford a constitutional crisis at the height of the Cold War. Nixon allegedly said to Mazo that \\"our country can't afford the agony of a constitutional crisis – and I damn well will not be a party to creating one, just to become president or anything else\\". Mazo would later express his disappointment at the decision, believing the series would have put him in contention for the Pulitzer Prize. Personal life Mazo was widowed from his first wife, but later remarried. He died at a hospital in Bethesda, Maryland from complications resulting from a fall at his home in Chevy Chase.

In other parts of Corsica, they are known as canistrelli or cocciole, but these are all fundamentally the same product. The biscuits are made with local raw materials, including white wine from the Patrimonio vineyards, sugar, flour and oil. Cujuelle are typically rhomboid (diamond-shaped), and come in several flavor varieties including almond, anise, lemon and chocolate. They are typically consumed by dunking in milk or muscat wine. History Cujuelle biscuits have been produced commercially in an artisanal factory in Calenzana since 1984. A similar product, Cujuelle de Zilla, began production in 1997. The recipe has remained the same since the factories' founding. Little is known of the history of the recipe prior to that.  Evolution  Over the course of the years, many variations of the basic product have been invented, with some ingredients added and others left behind. For example, some varieties leave out the white wine and other varieties include ingredients such as chocolate chips, raisins and nuts, and consequently change the name of the product. For example, the variant that includes nuts is called biscuits aux noisettes [biscuits with peanuts], while another variant is named biscuits avec raisins, noisettes et amandes [biscuits with raisins, peanuts and almonds], while a third is named Canestrelli a l'Anis [canestrelli with anise].  Producers  Presently, several brands sell Cujuelle biscuits. The main producers are Christian Perrin and Franck Dupré, both local bakers operating out of the Haute Corse region. Perrin runs a small bakeshop in Calenzana, while Perrin runs a farm in the district and produces the Cujuelle as a side business.

He was also known as one of the 11 among the Fifteen Martyrs of Bicol who were executed in Bagumbayan (Luneta), now Rizal Park, by Spanish authorities at the end of 19th century during the Philippine revolution. Life Being a native, he grew up and was raised in Polangui, in the province of Albay. At the time he was implicated, he was already pursuing a career as a successful professional, and commercial photographer, thereby maintaining his photographic studio at Nueva Caceres, now Naga City. Since at that time, photography was considered as novelty and as one of the luxuries, it made him well known amongst clients who were from families of government officials and businessmen who wanted their portraits taken. Involvement in the Philippine Revolution The onset of Philippine revolution on the last part of 1896 raised concerns among the Spanish authorities of its possible outbreak in the Bicol region. Thus, those who were liberal-minded were bitterly persecuted on grounds of not just holding separatist ideologies but on advocating the overthrowing of Spain's authority in the Philippines. These persecutions involved businessmen and professionals, mostly adherents to Masonry and members of the clergy. Among the arrested was Vicente Lukban, head of Masonic chapter, Triangulo Bikol, belonging to the Masonic lodge, La Luz Oriente, which, upon interrogation, implicated Jacob as one of the active member and supporter of the Katipunan. Arrest, trials and execution On September 19, 1896, he, along with many others accused with rebellion and sedition, he was arrested. Upon arrest, each of them were hung by their thumbs of fingers and beaten up, starved and insulted. Then they were sent and brought to Manila, for trial by the Provincial Junta of Camarines Sur headed by then Governor Julian Ocampo, on board steamer Isarog and imprisoned in Bilibid only to be tortured again. Even so, they were tortured and all, Jacob remained an exemplary as \\"the prisoner who suffered the most torture with great fortitude\\". After they were sentenced on accusations against them, on January 4, 1897, 5 days after Jose Rizal's execution, Jacob, along with 10 others were marched to the site and was executed with firing squad, as their families stood watch amongst the crowd. Then the Spanish authorities immediately ordered the families to bury them on that day to prevent outpouring sympathizers. Commemoration On March 7, 2017, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) unveiled the Camilo Jacob Historical marker in Polangui, Albay and turned it over to the local government of Polangui.

He is best known for black and white graphics, particularly the Woolmark logo, which was voted 'Best Logo of all Time' by Creative Review Magazine in 2011. Grignani was born in Pieve Porto Morone, Italy. He studied architecture in Turin between 1929 and 1933. Early on, he became absorbed in experimentations in photography, and in optic and visual phenomena. He played a part in Italy's second Futurist and Constructivist movements. Subsequently, his work was more closely associated with Kinetic Art and Op Art. Based on theories of perception, particularly on the Psychology of Form and his knowledge of architecture, he created more than 14000 experimental works. He remains a powerful influence in the world of graphic design. In Italy, Grignani is well known as the master of optical graphic design and his firm together with Studio Boggier were the leading names in Op-Art-Graphics in the 1960s. Early career During the 1930s he founded Studio Grignani designing advertising for clients such as Boleti, Fiat, Domus, Dompé pharmaceuticals, Mondadori, Montecatini, and Alfieri & Lacroix for whom he designed numerous campaigns. He experimented in the fields of photography and photomontage, investigating theories of the psychology of form. In 1952 he created a new corporate identity for Arti Grafiche Alfieri & Lacroix in Milan, to which he added designs for 150 posters. His work was exhibited in many contemporary art exhibitions, including Documenta 3 in 1964, alongside Jasper Johns, Francis Bacon, Anthony Caro and others. Grignani worked as Art Director at Bellezza d'Italia and became art director for Pubblicita in Italia annuals in 1956, where he continued for 26 years. He was a member of the juries of \\"Typedomus20\\" and the Warsaw Poster Biennale in 1970. He had more than 49 solo exhibitions from 1958 in various countries including the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, the US and Venezuela. In 1959 he won the Palma d’Oro for advertising and the gold medal at the Milan Triennale. In 1965 he took part in \\"Vision 65\\", the first Congress on human communication, held at the Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. In 1966 he received an award at the Warsaw Poster Biennale and another at the Venice Biennale in 1972. In 1967 he won the Typomundus 20, awarded by the International Centre for the Typographic Arts in New York to Alfieri & Lacroix. His work is displayed in international museums including MoMa in New York, the Stedelijk Museum of Amsterdam and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. He wrote various essays and taught both in Italy and the U.S.A. Research and Optics Grignani’s projects are based on continuous research and experimentation in visual perception and the creative use of graphic, photographic and digital media. His work was often in black and white, crisply rigorous and precise. Early in his career he started playing with perception, experimenting with photo montages, frames, drawings and overlays. He focused on eliciting emotion from viewers through direct interventions of the image, distorting the plastically shaped using twist, rotation, warping and splits, or the dynamic, through progression, acceleration, and perspective reversals exchange. The Power of Graphic Design ”To affirm its useful role in visual communication, graphic art must rely on a large number of experiments in order to achieve perfect freedom, facing the routine daily activities.” Grignani believed in the significance of graphic art and its impact, both conscious and subconscious, on daily life. Grignani pushed the entire field forward through experimental work which often breached the boundaries of physicality and psychology. About the design of Logos he said: \\"The drawing of a logo for a designer is the most […] exciting assignment, because in that symbol he tries to pour all his graphic sensitivity.\\" The Woolmark Logo The Woolmark logo. His most well-known work is the Woolmark logo, applied to more than five billion products worldwide, which is frequently credited with being a concise and powerful symbol. In 1963 the International Wool Secretariat (now Australian Wool Innovation) launched an international competition for a visual design that would represent new standards of quality and help build consumer confidence. There is some doubt as to whether the winning design was by Grignani himself, as he later claimed; he was a member of the jury and could not use his own name, and is thought to have used the pseudonym \\"Francesco Saroglia\\". His daughters claimed, after his death, that the entry had been submitted on his behalf by a Mr Spiriti, an owner of an advertising agency, who had asked him to provide some sample sketches. Shortly afterwards, the artist was invited to participate as a juror, and was amazed to see his own drawing among the entries. His daughter stated that he tried voting against it as the winning design because he was embarrassed. His sketchbook of Monday 4 April that year reveal a page of precise sketches for the Woolmark logo, including the winning entry, and this page was exhibited in a show of Franco Grignani's work in 1995 at the Aiap Gallery in Milan. The Woolmark Company, commented that the logo \\"has helped reinvent the global perception of wool as a natural, contemporary and glamorous fibre\\". The flexible and elegant form, similar to a Möbius strip, is cited as portraying the quality of wool and expressing its softness and purity in a uniquely memorable image. Penguin Sci-Fi Book Covers In 1968, Penguin's new art director for fiction, David Pelham, commissioned Franco Grignani to create a set of sixteen covers for a Sci-Fi mini-series in 1969-70. *The Day it Rained Forever by Ray Bradbury *The Wanderer by Fritz Leiber *Davy by Edgar Pangborn *Rork! by Avram Davidson *The Reefs of Space by Frederik Pohl and Jack Williamson *Bill, the Galactic Hero by Harry Harrison *The Squares of the City by John Brunner *Time Out of Joint by Philip K.

History Layout of the castle Ruins of the palas The oldest parts of the castle were probably built in the 12th century for a local noble family. In 1248 Locarnus de Norantola is mentioned in a record and in 1295 Petrus de Norantola is mentioned. However, by around 1300 the castle was owned by the powerful Counts of Sax/Misox and the Norantola family vanished from historical records. In 1324 Ugolinus von Sax was listed as the owner of the castle. In the early 14th century, the original castle was completely rebuilt. The old ring wall was topped with swallowtail crenallations. A new tower was built on the wall. The north wing, with apartments and a throne room, and a south wing with stables were added. The original palas had a gallery added and became the east wing. The rulers of the castle became a cadet branch of the Sax/Misox family, known as Sax-Norantola. In 1439 the local court ruled in favor of the Sax-Norantola family during a family conflict. However, in 1452 Count Henri von Sax-Misox signed an agreement with the residents of the valley that overturned all agreements and traditional rights between Sax-Norantola and the residents. In 1480 Count Peter von Sax and Gian Giacomo Trivulzio quarreled over Mesocco, which eventually led to a war. It appears that the Sax-Norantola family supported Trivulzio and his ally, the Duke of Milan. After 1480 either Trivulzio or the Duke of Milan helped reinforce that castle. However, it was ineffective because in 1483, during fighting between the Duke and the Count, Norantola Castle was burned by Sax-Misox troops. The castle was never rebuilt and in the 16th century the Sax-Norantola family lived in Bellinzona.

For nearly forty years she was the medical director at the East German Government Hospital. In connection with this, for forty years she was a member of the National legislature (\\"Volkskammer\\"), representing not a political party but the Democratic Women's League (\\"Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands\\" / DFD). Although her medical abilities were evidently well attested, the length of her tenure at the hospital and the number of national honours that she accumulated over the years indicate that she was also highly prized by the authorities for her discretion and \\"political reliability\\". Many sources use her double family name \\"Mucke-Wittbrodt\\" which incorporates the names of her first and second husbands. However, some sources identify her simply as Helga Wittbrodt.  Life  Helga Nydahl was born in Altona, at that time (and until 1938), a resolutely independent city directly to the west of Hamburg (into which it has subsequently been subsumed). , her father, was a teacher and education reformer who after 1945 became a district mayor in the Tempelhof quarter of Berlin. Her father became a schools inspector in 1919 and, in 1921, the family relocated to Berlin when he was appointed to a senior role (\\" Dezernent für das Volksschulwesen\\") in the national schools administration. It was therefore in Berlin, at the girl's lyceum (secondary school) that she passed her school final exams (Abitur) which opened the way to a university level education. In 1929 she embarked on her medical studies, still in Berlin. In 1936 she passed her state medical exams and received her doctorate (in medicine). Even before embarking on her medical studies Helga Nydahl joined the Young Socialists (\\"Sozialistische Arbeiter-Jugend\\" / SAJ) in 1928. The SAJ was in effect the youth wing of the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD) of which her increasingly political father was already a member, and which she herself had joined by 1933. Between 1936 and\`1945 she worked her way up through the hospital system, identified variously a volunteer, helper and assistant doctor. In 1943 she was appointed senior doctor and specialist internist at Berlin's \\"Urban Hospital\\" (\\"Urban-Krankenhaus\\"). Meanwhile, through her second marriage, to the scientist Hans Wittbrodt, towards the end of the 1930s she came into contact with the resistance movement. She was able to help victims of government persecution by falsifying medical certificates. Military defeat in May 1945 put an end to the Nazi régime. A large region surrounding Berlin and the eastern part of the city itself were now administered as the Soviet occupation zone. Between 1945 and 1948 Helga Wittbrodt was employed as a senior doctor, and then as head doctor, at the \\"Urban\\" City Hospital in Berlin's Tempelhof quarter (in the \\"American sector\\" of Berlin). In 1945 she joined the Communist Party (KPD), and in April 1946 she was among the thousands of communists who lost no time in signing their party membership across to the new Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), which by October 1949 would have become the ruling party in a new kind of German one- party dictatorship. Between 1946 and 1948 she also represented the KPD/SED party on the Berlin city council (\\"Stadtverordnetenversammlung\\"). In 1948 she was dismissed from her position at the \\"Urban Hospital\\" (\\"Urban-Krankenhaus\\"). The division of Berlin into military occupation zones agreed in 1945 was by now acquiring a level of permanence that few would have anticipated three years earlier, and she now relocated from the American occupation zone to the Soviet occupation zone, taking a post as a senior internist at the Charité (hospital). Her move was attributed, by the West German pro-Western news magazine, Der Spiegel, to \\"Communist activities\\" (\\"Wegen Kommunistischer Umtriebe\\"). In October 1949 she was appointed head doctor and director at the East German government hospital. This establishment, which had been adapted from an existing military hospital along the Scharnhorst Street that had been used, most recently, by the Soviet army, played no role in the hospitals infrastructure of Berlin. It was reserved for senior members of the East German government. For the next forty years there would be rumours and reports (appearing outside East Germany) that its patients enjoyed a superior quality of treatment, with access to drugs from the west not normally made available for treating East German patients and even, as they recovered, access to West German newspapers. It was also noted that patients at the government hospital seemed never to die: in reality, when they did die, the bodies were removed using a well concealed entrance at the back of the building, far from prying eyes. When, unavoidably, patients died under circumstances that might embarrass the authorities, the hospital was able to put an appropriate gloss on the event. The suicide in 1965 of Dr. Erich Apel, head of the state planning commission, was reported by the hospital in a bulletin signed by its medical director, the party-loyalist Helga Wittbrot as a \\"short-circuit reaction\\" caused by \\"nervous overload\\" (\\"Kurzschlußreaktion [infolge] nervlicher Überlastung\\"). She remained in post for a couple of years before she died. Mucke-Wittbrodt was also more directly engaged in the national power apparatus. Between 1950 and 1952 she was a member of the party leadership (\\"SED Landesleitung\\") for Greater Berlin. She was a member of the National legislature (\\"Volkskammer\\") for forty years, between 1950 and 1990, representing not a political party but the Democratic Women's League (\\"Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands\\" / DFD). It was a feature of the Leninist constitution that the country had adopted that the national legislature included fixed quotas of members representing both the authorized political parties and certain mass organisations, of which the DFD was one. This was seen as a way to enhance the legitimacy of the overall government structure. By 1990 she had become one of the longest serving Volkskammer members. Although membership of the national legislature was not unimportant, the focus of political power in the Soviet style \\"Communist\\" states of Central Europe after 1945 lay not with the parliament nor, indeed, with government ministers, but with the Central Committee of the ruling party. The Central Committee was, in turn, steered by its Politburo. Helga Wittbrodt was never a member of the Central Committee. She was, however, a member of the Medical Commission that reported directly to its Politburo. After the changes that led, in 1990, to reunification she remained true to the East Germany's old ruling SED (party) as it rebranded itself and – not always smoothly – reinvented itself as the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), fitted for the democratic Germany.

A Townsman of St Albans, he was a substantial property owner there and has been described as a 'hero' of the revolt.  Life  His name implies that he was a miller of grain. He was one of a number of millers who took part in the revolt, and has been described as having been eloquent and literate. It has also been suggested that he was an excommunicate priest, possibly an alumnus of St Albans Abbey. It thus possible that he was motivated at least in part to rebel as a result of the pressures of papal taxation. Along with Wat Tyler and John Wrawe, he was one of the key leaders of the peasants during the revolt of 1381, leading the townspeople of St Albans on 15 June. He was executed in 1381 along with John Wrawe and John Ball. His trial and execution was overseen by Henry le Despenser.  Role in Peasants' Revolt  During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, he became well known for his actions against the high lord Thomas de la Mare, Abbot of St. Albans. He led a deputation to King Richard II, whom the rebels met at Mile End which 'extorted' a letter from the King to the Abbot forcing the latter to give up the royal charters he held to the rebels. They ultimately destroyed the charters and a portion of the abbey itself. He was executed along with other leaders of the Revolt, and although his trial was deemed to have been fair, it has also been described as being in the nature of a 'show trial.' It has been suggested that he made a speech from the scaffold implicating John Wycliffe in the rebellion.  Sources  Most of the details about his life have been derived from the writings of Thomas Walsingham, who was a monk resident in an abbey, and may well have witnessed Grindecobbe's execution.

Malcolm McDowell, Michael Ironside and newcomer Johnny Morina star in a modern-day adventure filled with medieval magic. Plot A boy named Alex Cole and his friends have fun participating in pretend medieval battles at a \\"castle\\" built from a shed. After one such battle, the kids gather around a round table and Alex tells his friends about the legend of King Arthur. A group of bullies led by James \\"Scar\\" Scarsdale arrives and intimidates Alex's friends into fleeing. Alex fights back by throwing a water balloon at Scar. The bullies chase Alex into the woods, but Alex loses them and encounters a sword lodged in a stone. He pulls the sword from the stone, at which point the wizard Merlin appears and brings Alex to his dwelling in a tree where he begins teaching Alex how to use the sword, which he reveals to be Excalibur. Alex befriends a new kid at school named Luke, whom he invites to visit the castle. When they arrive, they find that Scar and his bullies are harassing Alex's friends. Alex calls upon the power of Excalibur, allowing him to easily defeat Scar in a fistfight. Alex, Luke, and the other kids manage to intimidate the bullies into retreating. To reward Luke for helping them, Alex accepts him as one of the \\"knights\\". Afterwards, Alex visits Merlin, who advises Alex that he should never misuse Excalibur's power, since doing so would lead to him losing Excalibur. Scar's father Butch tells his associates Gil and Stu that he plans to commit a crime and then to flee town. Alex finds out that his friend Jenny, whom he has a crush on, is attracted to Luke. This makes Alex depressed and he avoids visiting Merlin that day. Merlin, however, visits Alex at night and advises him that young love can lead to pain. The next day, Alex's jealousy causes him to attack Luke. Luke initially overpowers Alex and tries to talk sense into him, but Alex draws power from Excalibur and punches Luke to the ground. Jenny tells Alex that she now hates him for what he did and that he is worse than Scar. Rejected by his friends, Alex goes to Merlin's tree but Merlin is not there. He goes home to check on Excalibur, but the sword is gone. Alex returns to the tree, where he hears Merlin's voice tell him that he has misused Excalibur's power and that he hopes Alex will learn from his mistake. Alex talks with his father, who advises him to apologize to his friends. Butch, Gil, and Stu rob the local bank. Jenny is having a party at her house with several other kids, including Luke. Meanwhile, her father, Sheriff Rick Ferguson, hears about the robbery and goes out to deal with it. After Ferguson leaves, Butch and his henchmen go to the house and hold Jenny, her mother, and the party guests hostage. Butch, who has a grudge against Ferguson, plans to wait until Ferguson returns and use him as a hostage to get them past police roadblocks during their getaway. Alex arrives at Jenny's house and discovers what is happening. He sabotages the crooks' getaway car by flattening its tires. Alex lures Gil and Stu to a nearby barn, where he outsmarts and traps them. Alex sneaks into the house and calls the police to inform them of the situation. Butch captures Alex and takes him to the getaway car, abandoning his henchmen and the hostages. Despite the car's flat tires, Butch drives off with Alex. When the car gets stuck in a ditch, Butch tries to flee on foot with Alex, but Alex escapes and the other kids arrive and pelt Butch with apples. Alex disarms Butch and incapacitates him by throwing an apple at his groin. Sheriff Ferguson and the police arrive and arrest Butch. Alex apologizes to Jenny and Luke for attacking Luke and for being jealous. Later, Alex goes into the woods. He encounters Scar and his friends, who make peace with Alex. He goes to Merlin's tree, where Merlin appears and reveals to Alex that he never really lost Excalibur because Excalibur is the good in him. Alex asks if he is King Arthur, and Merlin tells him that he can be Arthur if he wants to be, i.e. aspire to be everything Arthur represented, though he is not Arthur reincarnated. Merlin then vanishes. The film closes with a scene in Los Angeles, where another child encounters a sword in a stone.

Early life and education Bernstein graduated from William A. Shine Great Neck South High School in 2010. Bernstein attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison where she studied retail and then transferred to the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. She left school to devote more time to her blog and turn it into a career. Bernstein is Jewish.https://forward.com/schmooze/454126/influencer-whose-summer- socializing-sparked-backlash-contracts-covid/ Career In 2011, Bernstein started WeWoreWhat as a street style photographer, which soon after transitioned into a personal style blog, as her Instagram account @WeWoreWhat gained popularity. In 2016, Bernstein launched a line of overalls called Second Skin Overalls, a direct to consumer brand. In 2017 at the age of 24, Danielle was placed on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list. In 2017 Bernstein designed a swimwear collaboration with Onia that exclusively sold at Intermix and was their best selling suit that Summer. The collaboration followed with two others, which the second of the two, an Italy inspired collection, drove over $3 million in sales total. Because of the success of their collaboration, in 2019 she launched her own swimwear line with Onia as her partners. In 2019, Bernstein teamed up with premium denim brand Joe's Jeans to design and release a new style of jeans, called the Danielle Jean. She is the first blogger and influencer to have a product collaboration with the company, and it led to a second collaboration with them that had added styles. In 2020, she made the decision to bring all her brands under one roof with the launch of Shop WeWoreWhat which included swim, denim, overalls, and most recently added active. In the Fall of 2019, Bernstein launched a tech company named Moe Assist, after her longtime intern-turned assistant Moe Paretti. Moe Assist is the first product management and payments tool specifically geared for an influencer's workflow, created by an influencer. With the desire to legitimize the industry, Danielle raised $1.2 million in a friends and family round of funding In March of 2020, Bernstein launched a namesake brand exclusively at Macy's called, Danielle Bernstein. The debut Spring collection was all priced under $100 and had a size range of 00-24, becoming Bernstein's first size- inclusive line. Along with the launch, Bernstein had a campaign shoot modeled by real-life followers, featuring women with different body shapes and types so that anyone could see themselves wearing the line. The first collection sold $1 million in the first 2 hours, and $2 million after 24 hours. The Danielle Bernstein Summer line launched in June 2020, and featured vintage inspired dresses and cute sets. In May 2020, Bernstein published an autobiography, This is Not a Fashion Story: Taking Chances, Breaking Rules, and Being a Boss in the Big City. She wrote about her personal life and her entrepreneurial journey.The book appeared on the New York Times Best Sellers list and was featured on the 'Business List.' However, the New York Times has since placed a \\"dagger\\" symbol alongside the book, indicating its listing includes suspicious \\"bulk purchases.\\" As a response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Bernstein launched her charitable arm of WeWoreWhat called \\"WeGaveWhat.\\" The organization began as a platform to support other charities and highlight small businesses that are struggling during the pandemic. To date she has raised over $80,000 and donated thousands of masks and meals to frontline workers. WeWoreWhat also teamed up with artist Sara Sidari to create a coloring book where 100% of the proceeds went directly to the River Fund, which brought in another $10,000. In September 2020, Bernstein was diagnosed with the coronavirus. She previously had been socializing in the Hamptons without a mask, prompting criticism for failing to follow CDC guidelines. Controversies = Copying of designs = In multiple instances, Bernstein has been noted for copying others' designs. In 2018, Bernstein received attention for copying the designs of various jewelry brands when she launched a series of products with Nordstrom. Foundrae, a specialized jewelry line, said that she had created nearly identical pieces after an earlier visit to the company's studio. Bernstein subsequently apologized in a tear-filled Instagram post and withdrew the copied pieces from the collection. In 2020, Bernstein announced a design for a cloth face mask with a chain. Fashion watchdog group Diet Prada, an Instagram account dedicated to highlighting instances of design copying, observed the mask was nearly identical to a patent-pending model created by a Latinx brand called Second Wind. Bernstein had earlier requested free samples from the company. Bernstein denied that she had copied the design from Second Wind. Days later, Bernstein posted to Instagram a photo of herself wearing what she claimed were a vintage pair of gym shorts, writing in the caption that she would be remaking the shorts to sell. The shorts were actually from an Etsy shop run by an Australian brand, Art Garments. After the Etsy seller published a receipt showing Bernstein had purchased the shorts from their store, Bernstein edited the Instagram caption to read, \\"CORRECTION - these are from Etsy and I totally thought they were vintage but they are made to order - someone on my team ordered them for me a while back - I will not be making them!\\" In August 2020, a Brooklyn lingerie store alleged that Bernstein had copied their signature design, which they use on tissue packaging, and used it on swimwear and as print wallpaper. = Conflict with Poshmark reseller = In January 2020, a clothing reseller posted swimwear for sale on the Poshmark platform, not realizing it was unreleased samples of Bernstein's swimwear collaboration with Onia. The samples had been accidentally donated to Goodwill by a showroom employee, where the reseller purchased them to sell online. Bernstein and the seller came to an agreement in which the reseller would remove the pieces from her store and sell them back to Bernstein. However, they argued over whether Bernstein had agreed to reimburse the costs of the swimwear as paid to Goodwill, or the seller's listed resale prices. Fearing the release of her new line, Bernstein spoke to the Poshmark CEO to halt the sale of the swimwear was put back up for sale. A Change.org petition was created titled \\"Pledge to Boycott Poshmark if they Continue to Allow the Bullying of Small Business.\\" Eventually, Bernstein and the reseller met in person and came to an agreement where the reseller was given merchandise from the previously collection to sell at a greater value.

It is bounded on the north by South Street, on the south by the CSX Railroad and Adler Street, on the east by Madison Avenue, and on the west by the White River.  History  By the early 1830s, Irish and Germans arrived as builders of the Central Canal and workers on the National Road. Many of the early immigrants were of the Catholic and Jewish faiths. St. John's was the first Catholic church built in the mid-1850s, followed by St. Mary's. However the need was growing for another church, so in 1875 nine lots were purchased on the northwest corner of Union and Palmer streets for Sacred Heart Catholic Church. This was a rural location with farmland north of Palmer and extending east to Madison Gravel Road. An influx of African Americans into Indianapolis by the hundreds took place between the 1840s and 1850s. They settled on the south side and by 1875, South Calvary Baptist Church was erected. The influx of Jewish citizens into Indianapolis created a need for organizations designed to help them settle into their urban homes. In 1856, the first Jewish congregation, the Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation, was organized. In 1914, the Jewish Federation built a settlement house on the Southside on Morris Street. By 1890, Indianapolis' near south side was densely populated and had the highest percentage of foreign-born residents of any district in the city.

It was one of the six sestieri of ancient Genoa. At present it is part of the Genoa's city Municipio I (Centro Est). Located close to the old harbour it had been for many centuries the seat of the economical power of the city.  Etymology  Maddalena takes its name from the church of Saint Mary Magdalene, documented since the 12th century.  Demographics  On 31 December 2015 there were 5,572 people living in Maddalena, with a population density of 20,637 people per km².Comune di Genova - Statistical Bulletin - February 2016, page 16  Geography  The neighbourhood is located in the old town of Genoa, between Prè and Molo, in the semi-plain area immediately behind the harbour delimited by piazza Banchi at south-east and via Lomellini at north-west. A characteristic feature of this neighbourhood is the dense grid of alleys close via della Maddalena and via San Luca, upstream of which is via Garibaldi, the 16th-century \\"strada Nuova\\" (\\"new street\\"), with the luxurious palaces of the oligarchic families of the Republic of Genoa; the seafront of the neighbourhood is piazza Caricamento, in front of the old harbour. History The first settlings in this area dated to the 10th century, when some houses were built outside the walls, in areas at that time rural, around the churches of San Siro, the first cathedral of Genoa, and Santa Maria delle Vigne.La mia terra, Il Secolo XIX, Genova, 1982 The urban growth incorporated these early settlements and in the 12th century both \\"civitas\\" (current Molo) and \\"burgus \\"(current Maddalena) were included within the new walls, known as Barbarossa’s walls.History of Maddalena in www.guidadigenova.itTouring Club Italiano, Guida d'Italia - Liguria, 2009 The feudal families had a key role in the development of the neighborhood; these families, constantly fighting each other, had their own private citadels in the alleys, each with a palace, a central square and sometimes a noble church, such as Spinola in San Luca and Calvi-Pallavicini in San Pancrazio. Alongside the feudal families, since the 13th century grew the importance of Arts and Crafts Associations, that give the names to some streets in the old town: today again many streets where craftsmen and tradesmen had their workshops are named after them, as a reference via degli Orefici (goldsmiths), piazza di Pellicceria (furriers), via dei Macelli di Soziglia (butchers) and vico dei Droghieri (grocers). In the 16th century upstream the neighborhood a luxurious residential settlement have been built. Along the \\"Strada Nuova\\" (now Via Garibaldi), opened close to the city walls, at the foot of the hill Castelletto where six of the most important Genoese families of that era (Doria, Grimaldi, Lomellini, Lercari, Pallavicini and Spinola) built their palaces.F. Caraceni Poleggi, Genova - Guida Sagep, 1984. The neighbourhood had long the economical centre of the city, and its role was strengthened in the 19th century, when the 16th-century \\"Loggia of the Merchants\\" became the seat of the stock exchange. However at the beginning of the 20th century the business centre of Genoa moved to De Ferrari Square and a period of decline began for the whole old town. During World War II many buildings were severely damaged by bombings. After the war the lower-class district on the neighbourhood was populated by petty criminals and later by criminal organizations who made the neighbourhood the main prostitution centre in Genoa, causing the abandonment by most of the original inhabitants and the consequent degradation of the buildings.A. Dal Lago ed E. Quadrelli, La città e le ombre: crimini, criminali, cittadini (The city and the shadows: crimes, criminals, citizens), Giangiacomo Feltrinelli Editore, Milan, 2003, Article (in Italian) in www.casadellalegalita.info During the first decade of the 21st century restructuring programs took place, and after many years of decline also these areas of the neighbourhood are showing signs of recovery.The action plans for the recovery of degraded areas of the old town of Genoa During Genoa Expo '92 exhibition the area of the old harbour was redeveloped by Renzo Piano, making it suitable for public access and the Aquarium, the largest one in Italy, designed by Piano himself together with Peter Chermayeff, was opened.Genoa For Visitors: Aquarium  Architecture  = The \\"strade nuove\\" = The \\"strade nuove\\" (new streets) are a way crossing the whole neighbourdood upstrem the alleys of the old town. They were opened between 16th and 18th century to create a new upper class residential district. Along \\"Strada Nuova\\" (now Garibaldi street) and \\"Strada Nuovissima\\" (\\"very new street\\", now Cairoli street) the most important Genoese families built their palaces, among the most luxurious of the whole city. Due to the slope of the land, the upstrem palaces were built at different levels, typically with a marble staircase that from the entrance hall leads to a raised courtyard, generally surrounded by columns, from which other staircases reach the upper floors and the rear gardens. * Via Garibaldi, \\"Strada Nuova\\" par excellence (this was officially its name until 1882), designed by Bernardino Cantone, was built between 1550 and 1588. It is 250 meters long and 7.5 meters wide. It was named after Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1882, soon after his death. Along this streets thirteen luxurious palaces overlook, and twelve of these are inscribed in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Site. Among them Palazzo Doria Tursi, now seat of the municipality of Genoa, Palazzo Bianco and Palazzo Rosso, which host an important art museum. The street had international fame also thanks to the painter Peter Paul Rubens who drew many of these buildings in the book Palazzi di Genova, published in Antwerp in 1622.Vintage pictures of via Garibaldi * Via Cairoli (\\"Strada Nuovissima\\"), designed by Gregorio Petondi was opened in 1786 as a continuation to the west of \\"Strada Nuova\\". The road is curved and ends in Largo della Zecca, where it joins the 17th century \\"Strada Balbi\\" through the short via Bensa and Piazza della Nunziata.Via Cairoli in 1901 The street is now named after Cairoli brothers, patriots and politician in the 19th century. * Piazza della Meridiana joins \\"Strada Nuova\\" and \\"Strada Nuovissima\\" and takes its name by the 18th century Gerolamo Grimaldi Palace, known as \\"Meridiana Palace\\", due to the sundial (in Italian \\"Meridiana\\") painted on its façade. * Piazza delle Fontane Marose, at the eastern end of via Garibaldi, takes its name by a monumental fountain, no longer existing, called \\"fons marosus\\" for its raging waters.History of piazza delle Fontane Marose in http://genova.erasuperba.it On the square there are several historic buildings, which are also inscribed in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Site.Vintage pictures of piazza delle Fontane Marose File:Via Garibaldi Genova.JPGVia Garibaldi File:Palazzo Doria Tursi l'ingresso.jpgPalazzo Doria Tursi, internal courtyard File:Genova- AP-1010518.jpgPalazzo Bianco File:Genoa Spianata Castelletto Palazzo Rosso.jpgPalazzo Rosso File:Centre et vieille-ville Gênes 1860 (8379503639).jpgVia Cairoli File:Palazzo della Meridiana Facciata piazza.JPGPalazzo della Meridiana File:Piazza Fontane Marose Genova 01.jpgPiazza delle Fontane Marose = Piazza Caricamento and Sottoripa porches = Detail of Sottoripa porches Piazza CaricamentoPiazza Caricamento was opened in the middle of the 19th century as the terminal railway station used for loading (in Italian \\"caricamento\\") goods landed in the port. Many vintage pictures show the square full of wagons waiting for loading or unloading goods. In the Middle Ages this area was occupied by the port quays and the sea came to lap the porch of Sottoripa, now facing the square. At the square center there is a bronze statue of Raffaele Rubattino, one of the main Italian shipowners, work of Augusto Rivalta (1889). Sottoripa with Morchi tower Sottoripa is a colonnaded street on the upstream border of the square, but it is much older than this. The porches were built between 1125 and 1133 and they were at that time directly overlooking the harbour. The porches are about 300 m long and occupy the entire sea front of the neighbourhood. Sottoripa means \\"below the bank\\", because the porticos foundations were literally below the level of the sea. Under the porches there were shops, workshops and fondachi, warehouses to store goods. = Palazzi dei Rolli = The \\"Rolli di Genova\\" were, at the time of the Republic of Genoa, an official list of public lodging palaces of eminent Genoese families which aspired to host, by draw, foreign notable people visiting Genoa. Most of these buildings still exist, and in 2006 forty-two of them were inscribed by UNESCO in the list of World Heritage Site. In Maddalena are 49 of these palaces (29 of which included in the list of World Heritage Site, included most of those of the \\"new streets\\").

The sea front of Maddalena coincides with the quays in front of Piazza Caricamento. In the Middle Ages the harbour was strictly linked to the city, but in 1536 new city walls were built that divided for a long time the city and the port. Only in 1992, being unused this part of the port, in the meantime enlarged towards the west, this area was redeveloped by Renzo Piano and opened to public access during Genoa Expo '92 exhibition. The main tourist attraction in this section of the old harbour is the aquarium, in front of which there is the Biosphere, known commonly as la bolla (the bubble), a glass and steel structure hosting inside plants and animals of the rainforest, designed by Renzo Piano and built in 2001. Nearby the aquarium there is the Neptune, replica of a 17th-century galleon, built in 1986 for the Roman Polanski’s film Pirates and now moored in the old harbour of Genoa as a tourist attraction.The old harbour of Genoa in the site of Galata-Museo del Mare  Aquarium  Aquarium of Genoa is the largest aquarium in Italy and the second largest in Europe, following that of Valencia, in Spain. It was inaugurated in 1992 and after several enlargements occupies at present an area of 9,400 m², with tanks that host fishes and reptiles. Some wide tanks host dolphins, sharks, seals, manatees, turtles and jellyfishes.

The museum tour starts from Palazzo Rosso, with paintings from the 15th to the 19th century and furniture from the 18th to the 20th century. In the Palazzo Bianco are displayed works by Italian, Flemish and Spanish artist from the 15th century onwards, among them an Ecce Homo by Caravaggio; in Palazzo Doria Tursi a Penitent Magdalene by Antonio Canova is exposed, in addition to the collections of ceramics, coins and the Cannone, the Paganini's violin, an 18th-century work by the luthier Giuseppe Antonio Guarneri, known as Guarneri del Gesù. * ' is located in the Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria, a historic building in the alleys of the old town, donated in 1958 by the heirs of the Spinola to the Italian Government, with its furnishings and artworks.

The Basilica of Santa Maria delle Vigne (St. Mary of the Vineyards) was built by some ancestors of Spinola at the end of the 10th century in the same place where a 6th-century chapel existed, outside the Carolingian city walls, at that time a rural zone with vineyards (in Italian \\"vigne\\", hence the name). In the 12th century it was included within the new \\"Barbarossa's walls\\" and became a parish church. It was modified several times and in the late 16th century the original Romanesque church was transformed in Baroque style by Daniele Casella. The bell tower is the only preserved part of the original building. In the 19th century the church had a new Neoclassicist façade, designed by Ippolito Cremona. Many art works, mainly by Genoese artists from 17th to 19th centuries are preserved inside the church. * San Siro was also built in the same place where another 6th-century chapel existed. The church, devoted to the Holy Apostles, was later dedicated to Syrus, one of the first bishops of Genoa, who lived in the 4th century, and was the cathedral of Genoa until the 10th century, when the bishop's seat was moved to the new church of San Lorenzo, less exposed to Saracen raids because included within the city walls. At the beginning of the 11th century it was given to Benedictines who built a new Romanesque church. In the 16th century it was entrusted to the Theatines who rebuilt it in Baroque style thanks to the financing of the noble families who had the giuspatronato of the chapels inside of the church. In the 19th century the church had a new Neoclassicist façade. The Romanesque bell tower was demolished in 1904 because it was unsafe and never rebuilt.G.B.

Built in 1929, it is an unusual medieval-styled construction designed by New York architect Alfredo S.G. Taylor. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Tom Thumb House is located south of the village center of Norfolk, on the south side of Windrow Road. It is set on a hillside above the road, from which it and an adjacent later house are screened by trees. It is a single-story structure, consisting of two roughly square sections joined at a corner. The walls of each section are made of large boulders, and are up to thick. The pyramidal roofs of each section, framed with hand-hewn timbers recycled from old barns, are covered in thick slate. One of the squares has the main living space, while the other houses a sleeping and kitchen area. Exposed framing and rough paneling, also recycled, are the principal exposed woodwork. The building was built in 1929 to a design by New York City architect Alfredo S.G. Taylor. Taylor spent many summers in Norfolk, and is credited with more than thirty commissions in the community. A number of them share the medieval features used in this building: the rough rustic stone and wood finishes, and heavy slate roof. Details of the building were published in American Architect and Building News after its construction. Taylor's work for the Childs family also included the Starling Childs Camp on Doolittle Lake, and the Childs Sports Building; the latter in particular, located north of Windrow Road, has similar style and construction methods to this building, but on a larger scale. This house was referred to by the family as the \\"Teahouse\\"; its \\"Tom Thumb\\" name was applied in the American Architect and Building News article.

In 2015, she became the first and only Irish person honoured as Righteous Among the Nations by the State of Israel, in recognition of her work in the Spanish Civil War and World War II. Biography Winthrop Street in Cork's city centre. The pharmacy was located where McDonald's is shown (4 Winthrop Street) Elmes was born on 5 May 1908 in Cork, Ireland to chemist Edward Elmes and Elizabeth (née Waters). Edward Elmes was originally from Waterford, and moved to Cork after qualifying as a pharmacist, to run a pharmacy on Winthrop Street, while Waters grew up in Cork. She had one brother, John, who later took over the family business. Elmes attended Rochelle School in Cork and then in 1928 enrolled at Trinity College Dublin where she was elected a Scholar, and gained a first in Modern Literature (French and Spanish). In 1935, as a result of her academic achievements, Elmes was awarded a scholarship in International Studies to study at London School of Economics. She received a certificate in International Studies as well as a further scholarship to continue her education in Geneva, Switzerland. =Spanish Civil War= In February 1937, after the completion of her studies, Elmes joined the University of London Ambulance Unit and was sent to a children's hospital in Almeria in then war- torn Spain. =Saving Jewish Children= In 1942, the Vichy authorities made it clear that Jewish children were not legally allowed to be exempt from being sent to the concentration camps, as they had been. Elmes, with help from some colleagues, rescued dozens of children, taking them to safe houses or helping them flee the country altogether. Well aware that she was putting herself at risk, Elmes hid many children in the boot of her car and drove them to safe destinations. She aided many others by securing documents, which allowed for them to escape through the undercover network in Vichy France. She was not a Quaker herself, despite sometimes being described as the \\"head of the Quaker delegation at Perpignan,\\" but worked actively with local Quaker organisations. In January (or February) 1943, Elmes was arrested on suspicion of aiding the escape of Jews and was imprisoned in Toulouse, later being moved to the notorious Fresnes Prison run by the Gestapo near Paris, where she spent six months. Personal life Elmes married and had two children, and lived on after the war in Pyrénées-Orientales (Northern Catalonia) where she had been active, first in Perpignan and then in Canet-en-Roussillon and Sainte-Marie- la-Mer. La villa Saint Christophe à Canet Plage : le secours aux enfants du camp de Rivesaltes (1941-1943) on cultureetpatrimoinevillelonguet.blogspot.com She died in a nursing home there. Honours After the war Elmes was awarded the Legion of Honour (French:Légion d'honneur), the highest civilian award in France at the time, which she refused to accept on the grounds of unwanted attention for what she did. On 23 January 2013, 11 years after her death, having been nominated by one of the children she rescued, she was posthumously recognised by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations, her children and grandchildren receiving the award on her behalf, and on 30 September 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Trish Murphy Award at the Network Ireland Business Woman of the Year awards in Cork, which was accepted by her nephew, Mark Elmes, on behalf of her family. On the 25th of February 2019 it was announced by Cork City Council https://twitter.com/corkcitycouncil/status/1100099096017281026 that a new pedestrian bridge linking Patrick's Quay to Merchant's Quay would be named after Mary Elmes.

It was formerly classed in the genus Haworthia, as Haworthia minima. However this was not the correct name, as the name Haworthia minor in fact had priority.Haworthia minima - WCSPHaworthia minor - WCSP When the species was transferred to the new genus Tulista, a combination was first published for Tulista minima, which was likewise invalid.Tulista minima - IPNI A new combination was therefore needed for Tulista minor, which was accordingly published in 2018.Tulista minor - WCSPTulista minor - Phytotaxa 346(2) Description It is a small evergreen succulent plant, with hard, fleshy blue-green leaves that are covered in white tubercles. It offsets readily and can form clumps. It produces white flowers with pink tips in the summer (November to December). It is a variable species, with different populations differing in the leaf shape, colour, growth form and tubercles. Popular varieties include T. minima var. poellnitziana, as well as the opalina and obrata varieties. Naming and taxonomy Tulista minima in cultivation The elongated \\"poellnitziana\\" form, from the far west of the species range It was formerly placed in the genus Haworthia, along with the other large species (H. pumila, H. kingiana and H. marginata) in the \\"Robustipedunculares\\" subgenus. Following recent phylogenetic studies, it has been shown that these four species in fact constitute a distinct out-group, separate from other haworthias. They have therefore been classed as a separate genus, Tulista.Manning, J.C., Boatwright, J.S., Daru, B.H., Maurin, O. and Van der Bank, M. 2014. A molecular phylogeny and generic classification of Asphodelaceae subfamily Alooideae: A final resolution of the prickly issue of polyphyly in the Alooids?. Systematic Botany 39(1):55-74. , the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families does not accept the name Tulista minima. Its synonymy for the earlier combination Haworthia minima regards Haworthia minor as the correct name. On this basis the species should not be transferred to Tulista using the specific epithet minima, but rather as Tulista minor.Smith, GF; Figueiredo, E; Molteno, S. (2018) A new combination in Tulista, T. minor (Alooideae, Asphodelaceae). Phytotaxa, [S.l.], v. 346, n. 2, p. 201–202, apr. 2018. ISSN 1179-3163. Available at: . doi:https://dx.doi.org/10.11646/phytotaxa.346.2.8. Haworthia opalina has been treated as either part of Haworthia minima or, less often, as a separate species. In the second case, on transfer to Tulista, T. opalina is recognized in addition to T. minima. The name \\"minima\\" simply means \\"smaller\\" as it is not as large as its closest relatives, such as \\"Tulista pumila\\". In some old records it is also occasionally classed as Haworthia margaritifera. Two main varieties are recognised: the main variety minima, and the rarer variety in the far north-west of its range, poellnitziana (Uitewaal), which has longer slender leaves and grows in gravelly fynbos vegetation. Distribution The natural distribution of this species is in the far southern part of the Western Cape, South Africa. Its range extends from Botrivier and Agulhas, eastwards to Brandrivier, Herbertsdale and Hartenbos.Molteno, S.; Smith, GF (2019) A significant westerly extension of the natural distribution range of Tulista minor (Aiton) Gideon F.Sm. & Molteno (Asphodelaceae: Alooideae) in the Overberg, Western Cape Province, South Africa. Bradleya, v. 37, p. 201-211, may 2019. doi:https://doi.org/10.25223/brad.n37.2019.a18. Its habitat is usually coastal Renosterveld vegetation. It often occurs alongside other Tulista species and is known naturally to hybridise with Tulista marginata where the two species overlap near Heidelberg. Cultivation It is a very easy plant in cultivation, but is nonetheless very rarely grown. It requires well-drained soil, and tolerates both semi-shade and sun. It can be grown from seed, but it offsets and subdivides naturally so it can also be propagated simply by dividing the resulting clump.

However, the present structure is largely a result of 18th century renovations. The temple is still being visited today and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the town. This temple is considered as one of the oldest sun temples in India.  History  The Temple was dedicated to the Hindu sun god Surya. The walls in the temple are inscribed saying the creator of the temple was the ruler Devendra Varma, stating it was built in the time period known to them as the 7th century. The walls also state the temple was fixed and changed a bit to help with some of the sun temple's major flaws during their 18th and 19th century. A lot of these changes were contributed by the Dusi family. The temple fell into despair over the centuries and was reconstructed in 1778 CE by Elamanchili Pullaji Panthulu. Over the years the Sun temple has been an important landmark for many of the festivals celebrated in the town. Including the important festival Rathasaptami.

Except for illustration, the fields of her interest were book design, collage and papier-mache objects. She illustrated more than 50 books, and numerous book covers and magazine illustrations. Won 12 important Yugoslav national awards for illustration. Performed six one-man exhibitions. Ida Ćirić (1932-2007), a biography, Project Rastko  Biography  Her father Svetislav Vučković (1902–1973) was an engineer and before the 2nd World War one of the leaders of the Slavic \\"Falcon\\" gymnastic movement (Serbian Soko, Czech Sokol). Mother Slavka (1903–1983) was professor of gymnastic. Her older brother dr Vladan Vučković (1928–2006) was an engineer, a professor at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Belgrade, an excellent pianist and chess problemist, and her younger brother was Dragan Vučković (1930–1998) traffic engineer and multiple Yugoslav champion in rally. During the studies at the Academy of Applied Arts in Belgrade, she met her future husband Miloš Ćirić (1931–1999), with whom she got two sons, Rastko (b. 1955) and Vukan (b. 1959). It was the beginning of the artistic Ćirić family, today having the third generation of professional art creators. Upon graduation, Ida and Miloš Ćirić work and exhibit together. Ida specialized in children's illustration, which she will cherish incessantly for the next thirty years, up to the end of the 1980s, marking the whole period with her characteristic stylization of figures and rich color. Art historian Vesna Lakićević Pavićević, the specialist for Serbian illustration, says: \\"Ida Ćirić, during the four decades, worked as an illustrator and reached the results without which one can not make the real picture about the development of Serbian illustration of the second half of the Twentieth century.\\"Vesna Lakićević Pavićević: Illustrated Serbian journals for children /Ilustrovana štampa za decu kod Srba /, Ulupuds, Belgrade, 1994. Ida's simplified and optimistic illustrations for children, full of bright colours, raised the generations of children. She had used art techniques as colour markers, coloured inks, which enabled an intensive colour scale and joyful emotive charge. Her black and white illustrations have legible and strong graphism, \\"which does not fall behind the Miloš's in their energy\\".Rastko Ćirić: \\"Ida Ćirić – a sketch for biography\\" /\\"Ida Ćirić – skica za biografiju\\"/, catalogue of the posthumous retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Applied Arts in Belgrade, 2009.

The album was issued in December 2016 via House of Mythology.\\"Ulver to release Riverhead movie soundtrack\\". Team Rock, November 30, 2016. The music was composed by Ulver, this time consisting of Ole-Henrik Moe, Kristoffer Rygg, Kari Rønnekleiv, Jørn H. Sværen, and Tore Ylwizaker and recorded, edited, and mixed by Kristoffer Rygg and Tore Ylwizaker at Oak Hill studios, Oslo, between June–July 2016. The final recordings were mastered by Jaime Gomez Arellano at Orgone, London, in September 2016. The soundtrack has been described as “sparse and minimal as ever, but with a gentle drive to its arc.” Background Justin Oakey is an award-winning filmmaker from Newfoundland who had previously collaborated with Ulver. Writing about the soundtrack, Oakey says: Critical Reception Alex Lynham, writing for Prog magazine, says “their electronic and ambient influences shine strongly, and lend themselves well to the cinematic atmosphere, but perhaps less obviously where there are organic instruments there remains a strong folk influence.” Lynham concludes, “As a soundtrack album, it’s entirely possible that only hardcore fans of Ulver will find it essential; however, for those interested in the band beyond their early mercurial folk and black metal records, this is an interesting and captivating document of their electronic and cinematic work.” The Wire magazine’s review in their February 2017 issue explains, “The film deals with poisonous rivalry existing between two hierarchical neighbours over family and religion. It’s bleak and minimalist in its telling, and Ulver’s score accompanies the mood of the story perfectly, with sawing strings and frozen musical passages giving a sense of immediate danger as the plot unravels. Also impressive is the way the music entwines round the film’s snowy landscape, soughing through the trees like an ill wind to add an extra chill to the proceedings.” Track listing  Personnel  Ulver *Kristoffer Rygg – synth Pads, pedalboard, percussion *Jørn H.

The school is part of the Lester B. Pearson School Board offering secondary III, IV, and V education along with its partner Westwood High School Junior Campus which offers secondary I and II education. Approximately 90% of graduates continue their education at CEGEP and vocational schools. Location Westwood Senior High School is located in the town of Hudson, Quebec of the Montérégie administrative region within the Greater Montreal metropolitan area of Quebec – roughly 24 km west of Montreal Island. History Immigrant families from Cumberland, England first began to settle on this land in the early 1800s. Attracted by the rolling hills, fertile lands for farming, and proximity to the Ottawa River, families put down their roots along the Lake of Two Mountains. Beginning construction in 1919 and officially opening in February 1920, Westwood Senior High School, previously Hudson High School, is a school with a long history. Renovations first began when it became necessary to erect a fence in order to prevent cattle from wandering onto the yard during lunch. Since then, the population of Hudson and surrounding towns has continued to grow, leading to major renovations and additions in 1939, 1948–49, 1961–62, and in 1987-88. Due mainly to population growth, Hudson High School was renamed Westwood Senior High School on July 1, 2003. Divided into two campuses, Westwood Senior High School comprises secondary III, IV, and V students while the smaller campus Westwood High School Junior Campus comprises secondary I and II students. Programs and activities  Westwood Senior High School offers a variety of co-curricular programs which includes athletics, drama, music, art, cultural activities, debating, student government, community service, tutoring, and more. Clubs available to students include Journalism, Library Club, Art Club, Drama Club, Outdoors Club, Model UN, Sisterhood (a club that aims to bring together and empower girls through a safe community on campus), Brotherhood (a club that aims to improve the image that high school boys have acquired by engaging in positive school activities), Ceramics, Corporate Pitch (a club responsible for raising funds towards Bridge to Burundi), and Yearbook. Sport activities are available to students during the fall season: Soccer, Cross country running, Volleyball, and Softball; the winter season: Basketball, Curling, Cross-country skiing, and Wrestling; and the spring season: Rugby, Girls touch football, Lacrosse, and Outdoor track and field. A Word-Study Program is offered which allows students to work outside of school 1 day per week in order to practice a skill or trade which may interest them as a future career. This course counts for 4 credits, and students are expected to continue to take a full course load. Secondary V students have the opportunity to participate in the International Development Project which consists of a 2-3 week cultural exchange in a Central or South American country. The aim of this project is to expose students to global issues and encourage community involvement as well as fostering respect, responsibility, cooperation, and accountability. Bridge to Burundi The Bridge to Burundi project was started in October 2009 by students who were touched by a presentation given by one of the teachers, native Burundian Jean-Claude Manirakiza, about the state of education in his home country following the Burundian genocides. The students set out on the process of building an elementary school in Rwoga, Burundi and after 8 months opened the school to 60 1st graders. The project has continued to grow and now offers free education and supplies to more than 400 students, a medical center, a convenience store, a flour mill, solar panels, and drinkable water to the village. Funds for the project have been raised through bake sales, talent shows, dances, corporate sponsors, and in 2015 the students of Westwood Senior High School published their first children's book \\"Bakuru and the School on the Hill\\" The project has been officially endorsed by Lt.-General Roméo Dallaire, a former UN Commander; the Burundi government; Greg Mortensen (internationally-bestselling author of Three Cups of Tea); Primus Online, Aeroplan, and Facebook Canada. The project also won an award at the 2010 Quebec Entrepreneurship Contest.

After World War I the SMS Tegetthoff, SMS Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand, SMS Radetzky and SMS Zrinyi were ceded to Italy as war reparations. The four ships being scrapped in Italy between 1920 and 1926. The guns salvaged by the Italians were known as Cannon 305/42.In Italian nomenclature the first number indicates the caliber expressed in millimeters, the second the length in calibers. This second value is 42 calibers because the Italians calculated the length of the barrel excluding the firing chamber. Construction A total of sixty-five guns were built by Skoda. The first thirteen were for the Radetzky-class, while the last fifty-two guns were for the Tegetthoff-class. Only the Tegetthoff-class carried the K10 guns. The K10 differing from the earlier guns by having a longer firing chamber to accommodate a larger propellant charge. Otherwise weights, dimensions and ballistic performance for the two series of guns were very similar. Both guns used Krupp horizontal sliding breech blocks with separate loading metallic cased charges and projectiles. Unlike other large naval guns of the time which used separate loading bagged charges and ammunition, the 30.5 cm /45 used separate loading ammunition with charges inside of a brass cartridge case to provide obturation. Ammunition Ammunition was of separate loading type with a cartridge case which weighed and a bagged charge which weighed .

These included Trapani, Pantelleria, Tobruk, Ischia, Ponza, Leros and Capri. At the outbreak of World War II, only three guns on single mounts slated for Tobruk, were instead used to arm Battery Cattaneo near Taranto. These fortifications were still incomplete at the time of the Italian armistice in 1943. Another two guns were considered for the monitors GM191 and GM192. 305 mm /46 Model 1909 guns from the scrapped Dante Alighieri and the salvaged Leonardo da Vinci were also under consideration, but the 305/42 was considered to be less costly to build installations for. However a limited ammunition supply militated against widespread use of the 305/42.

Life The son of Lewis Meryon of Rye, Sussex, from a Huguenot background, he was born on 27 June 1783. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, from 1796 to 1802. Obtaining a Stuart's exhibition to St John's College, Oxford, he matriculated there on 29 March 1803, and graduated B.A. 1806, M.A. 1809, M.B. and M.D. 1817. He studied medicine at St. Thomas's Hospital under Henry Cline. With Cline's recommendation, Meryon was in 1810 taken on by the eccentric Lady Hester Stanhope, as her medical attendant, on a voyage to Sicily and the Near East. He was with her during her seven years' wanderings, saw her finally settled on Mount Lebanon, and then returned to England to take his medical degrees. Meryon revisited Syria at Lady Hester's request in 1819, and found that she had adopted local customs. A clash with one of her medical men ended his stay. Charles Lewis Meryon, portrait by Arminius Mayer Meryon was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 26 June 1820, and a fellow on 25 June 1821. Shortly afterwards he became domestic physician to Sir Gilbert Heathcote, 4th Baronet, but in 1827, at the request of Lady Hester Stanhope, he started again for Syria, with his wife and family. They were attacked and robbed en route by a pirate, and returned to Livorno, where they stayed for a time. In November 1830 they sailed from Marseille, and arrived at Mount Lebanon about 15 December. Lady Hester had a large household, with about 30 servants, and over time became house-bound. She would talk to Meryon for hours on end, into the night. She moved to Joun, and died in 1839. After disagreements, mainly centred on his wife, Meryon left Mount Lebanon in April 1831. He paid Lady Hester a fourth and last visit between July 1837 and August 1838. Settling in London, Meryon died there on 11 September 1877, aged 94. Works Courtyard, illustration from Travels of Lady Hester Stanhope, vol. 3 Meryon published in London Memoirs of the Lady Hester Stanhope, as related by herself in Conversations with her Physician, (1845, 3 vols.) They form, in effect, a sequel to his work of the following year, Travels of Lady Hester Stanhope, forming the completion of her Memoirs narrated by her Physician (1846, 3 vols. London). The 1860 poem The Origin of Rome and of the Papacy, by \\"Deuteros Whistlecraft\\", is attributed to Meryon. It is a translation from Giovanni Battista Casti. Family Meryon had a son with Narcisse Chaspoux, a French ballet dancer, the artist Charles Méryon. Edward Meryon M.D. was a nephew.

It was developed by Chris DelGuidice through his Florida- based company, Del American. Originally, DelGuidice planned to build apartments on the site around 2001, and he subsequently added a condominium component. The project was announced in August 2003, but the apartment aspect was removed from the project later that year because of rising construction costs. The project, to be known as Vegas Grand, was to consist of 880 condominium units. A class action lawsuit by condominium buyers was filed against Del American in 2005, after they were informed that the prices on their units would be raised in order to cover rising construction costs. The lawsuit was settled a year later. After several delays, construction began in March 2006. Lehman Brothers, which co-financed Vegas Grand, took control of the project in October 2007, after Del American defaulted on its loan. The project was ultimately opened around 2010, as a 212-unit apartment complex. Other buildings that had been planned for the project were never built. History The project was built by Chris DelGuidice through his company, Del American, based in Florida. It was built on located at the intersection of East Flamingo Road and Swenson Street. DelGuidice got the idea for the project around 2001, after reading an article about Las Vegas and the need for more apartment buildings there. DelGuidice chose the property because of its proximity to the Las Vegas Strip, although the site had been overlooked by other developers because of several issues associated with it. The land was located beneath a flight path, and it had washes going through it. DelGuidice initially planned to build apartments on the land, but he held off on the project because of the economic impact of the September 11 attacks. As time went on, construction costs began to rise, although apartment rents remained steady, which convinced DelGuidice to add a condominium component to his project. DelGuidice said, \\"We did market research and found a strong demand for condos, so we added that to the apartments.\\" DelGuidice announced the then-unnamed project on August 4, 2003. The project was to include 440 apartment units and an equal number of condominium units. Apartments were to be priced between $850 and $3,000 per month, while condominiums would range from $200,000 to $600,000. DelGuidice purchased the land for $4 million, after working for three years to acquire the property. The land had previously been owned by Nevada Power Company, and was appraised at $11.2 million. Originally, the project was to be built by Weis Builders of Minneapolis, at a cost of $225 million. Groundbreaking was initially expected to take place in February or March 2004, with the first apartment building scheduled to be completed within 15 months. The project's 12-story condominium building was expected to take approximately 21 months to construct. Within three months of the project's announcement, construction estimates had increased to $325 million. Because of the high costs, DelGuidice cancelled plans for the apartment units, opting instead for all 880 units to be used as condominiums. On November 9, 2003, Del American announced that the project would be named Vegas Grand, and that it would have an Italian theme. By that point, 102 units had been reserved through a party that DelGuidice held at the Bellagio resort. At the time, construction was scheduled to begin in spring 2004, with the first units available in fall 2005, and full completion in 2007. The project's 880 units would be located in 12- and 6-story towers. DelGuidice called the property an \\"extremely challenging site,\\" because of an adjacent power station and because of the Flamingo and Tropicana washes located on the land. Vegas Grand was designed by JMA Architecture Studios. The project was designed to avoid having an effect on the washes. DelGuidice said that the land had also been \\"rezoned from three units per acre to 45 units and engineered it to make it work for us.\\" Sales officially began in December 2003. =Construction= As of May 2004, construction was scheduled to begin later in the fall, with phase one consisting of a 12-story tower. Future phases were to add two six-story buildings and two four-story buildings. Completion was scheduled for 2007. In June 2004, Turner Corporation was announced as general contractor for the project, which was expected to cost $360 million. Construction was expected to begin that summer. In July 2004, Del American received a $240 million loan for the project, from Lehman Brothers and from Hypo Real Estate Capital Corporation. At that time, more than 800 of the project's units had been reserved, with construction scheduled to begin in September 2004. Construction was delayed by permitting issues. During the delay, Turner resigned itself from the project because of rising construction costs. Summit Builders became the new contractor. Grading and infrastructure work was underway in early February 2005. Plans at that time included the 12-story Villa d'Este building, the six-story Cipriani and Villaggio buildings, and the four-story Bella Venezia building. By May 2005, Del American was seeking approval from Clark County to add two additional stories to the project, for a new total of 994 units. DelGuidice said the additional units were necessary to keep up with demand and to cover the construction costs. Site preparation concluded that month, with construction possibly beginning in early June 2005. By December 2005, construction costs on Vegas Grand had increased to $650 million. That month, after extensive drainage and environmental work relating to the washes, a construction permit was issued for the project's 212-unit Bella Venezia I building. Bella Venezia I and II, to be constructed by Summit Builders, would have a total of 425 condominiums in two four-story buildings, totaling of residential space. The two buildings would also include two parking structures and retail space. Bella Venezia I was scheduled for completion in early 2007, followed by the scheduled completion of Bella Venezia II later that year. Summit Builders began construction on March 1, 2006, with Bella Venezia I expected for completion in May 2007. In August 2006, Del American announced that the second phase consisting of the 213-unit Bella Venezia II and a 12-story, 129-unit condominium tower would soon begin construction. When Del American defaulted on its loan, Lehman Brothers took control of the project for $55 million through an auction in October 2007. In May 2008, Lehman Brothers hired CB Richard Ellis to market the property. Bella Venezia I was near completion at that time, and was accompanied by of vacant land that was approved for an additional 782 units. Geoffrey West, First Vice President for CB Richard Ellis, said, \\"It was originally intended as a for-sale condominium project, but that market has all but disintegrated. This gives an opportunity to utilize it as luxury apartments, a nongaming hotel and resort or a time share. What it does is widen the range of possible uses and makes it more appealing.\\" Approximately $107 million had been spent on the first phase, which included the infrastructure for the 782-unit second phase. =Lawsuit= In April 2005, Del American notified approximately 800 potential buyers with existing reservations that the purchase price for their units would increase as a result of higher costs for concrete, steel, and labor. DelGuidice said that none of the reservations had been converted into contracts and were thus voidable by the buyers. In May 2005, a class action lawsuit was filed against Vegas Grand Condominiums Limited Partnership and Del American because of the price increases. The lawsuit consisted primarily of Nevada residents who purchased units and claimed breach of contract, fraud, deceptive trade practices, and other allegations. According to the lawsuit, buyers had signed reservation agreements and made deposits ranging from $10,000 to $25,000, possibly dating back to November 2003. The lawsuit alleged that the new prices were nearly doubled from the initial price and that \\"the defendants had no intention of selling the condominium units to plaintiffs and the class members for the original price.\\" More than 20 additional plaintiffs were added to the lawsuit a week later. By March 2006, negotiations were underway towards settling the lawsuit. In August 2006, a federal judge gave preliminary approval of a settlement deal. Del American settled the lawsuit in November 2006, and was ordered to pay 2.5 percent of gross sales proceeds into a common fund for 638 people who placed reservations. However, because the project entered foreclosure, DelGuidice never made a profit and the plaintiffs ultimately received no money. In 2016, DelGuidice referred to the project as a \\"big calamity\\" and said he would never develop condominiums in Las Vegas again. =Las Vegas Grand= The project was opened around 2010, as a 212-unit apartment complex called Las Vegas Grand. Only one of the originally planned buildings was finished; the other four never began construction. Joseph Daneshgar, a southern California investor, purchased Las Vegas Grand in November 2019, at a cost of $47.6 million. At the time, the complex was 96 percent occupied. Daneshgar also owned the nearby Boca Raton condominiums.

His football career ended in 2010 when he became paralyzed while making a tackle during a kick off in a game against Central College. He was given a 3% chance of ever regaining movement below the neck but has continued to recover some sensation and mobility throughout his body—including his hands, legs, feet and torso. Today he lives in Florida with his wife and 5 kids where he manages his non-profit foundation and works full-time as a motivational speaker.  Injury  On October 16, 2010, Norton fractured his C3 and C4 vertebrae in the 3rd quarter of play during a football game against Central College in Decorah, Iowa. The fracture occurred on impact as his head collided with the ball carrier's knee during a kick-off return. As the pile cleared, Norton lay face down, motionless on the ground. He was transported off the field via ambulance and taken for emergency care to Winnishiek Medical Center where doctors stabilized him for an airlift to neighboring Mayo Clinic. Later that night at Rochester's Mayo Clinic, Norton underwent surgery in which a piece of his hip bone was used to fuse together his C3, C4 and C5 vertebrae. Prior to the surgery doctors gave him a 3 percent chance of regaining any movement below his neck;. The surgery ended after three hours without any serious complications. = Recovery = The morning of October 17, 2010, Norton awoke with his neck immobilized and a tube placed in his throat to supplement oxygen flow. Although he couldn't initially speak he was able to shrug his left shoulder ever so slightly—defying the doctor's prognosis. He spent the next five days in the ICU before being transferred to rehab for near-daily occupational and physical therapy sessions over the next four months. Two weeks after the injury he regained enough movement in his hands to operate a power steering configuration for an electric wheel chair. Five weeks into his rehab he regained some movement and feeling throughout his upper body but still was unable to move anything below his waist. In March 2011 he moved into the Ronald McDonald house of Rochester and continued rehab in Mayo Clinic's outpatient program for the next three months. On May 20, 2011, Norton moved back home to Bondurant, Iowa and regained enough strength throughout his torso and arms to operate a power assisted wheel chair by the fall of 2017. He return to Luther College where he lived in campus housing with a group of former teammates. His sister, Alex, a registered nurse, moved close by to help. On May 24, 2015, he accepted his diploma in Business Management and was able to walk across the stage with assistance from his fiancée, Emily Summers. The video of his walk has reached over 300 million views. On April 21, 2018, Norton married Emily Summers in Jupiter, Florida. Norton sat in his wheelchair while exchanging vows, before being helped up by Emily and slowly walking up the aisle together with Emily's support. Their ceremony was filmed by People magazine, and video of Norton walking with Emily again went viral.  Foundation  In 2012, Norton and his family founded the SCI CAN Foundation, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization to raise money for individuals with spinal cord injuries in Iowa and the Midwest. It hosts annual fundraising dinners and various functions throughout the year pay for grant to rehab facilities, hospitals and individuals. As of 2017, the SCI CAN Foundation has raised over $600,000.  Speaking career  While still in college, he traveled around northern Iowa to speak with church groups, college clubs and local sports teams, and eventually also to corporations and conferences across the country. Along with his father, Terry, he published a father-son memoir, \\"The Power of Faith When Tragedy Strikes\\" in 2015. After college Norton started his own speaking company, Norton Motivation, operating out of Port St. Lucie, Florida.

As of September 2014, the project is on hold. The project was announced by chef Charlie Palmer as a boutique condo hotel in 2006, with groundbreaking scheduled for later that year. In 2007, the proposed location for the project was changed to Symphony Park, and the condominium was removed from the project. The opening had initially been scheduled for November 2011, but the start of construction was delayed several times between 2010 and 2014, due to the poor state of the local hotel market. History =Original project= The Charlie Palmer Hotel was announced by chef Charlie Palmer in April 2006. The project would have included a 35-story boutique condo hotel with 400 to 500 rooms, primarily consisting of studio and one-bedroom units that would range from to . The project was to be built on the three-acre site of the Golden Palm Hotel, located at the intersection of Tropicana Avenue and Dean Martin Drive. The project was to cost $400 million, and was scheduled to break ground later in 2006, with its completion expected for mid-2008. Palmer's partners in the project included Marvin Lipschultz, the owner of the property; Bill Richardson, the owner of W.A. Richardson Construction and a former executive for Mandalay Resort Group; and Dan Juba, the principal of the locally based Klai Juba Architects. Adam Tihany, who designed the interior for Palmer's Aureole restaurant in Las Vegas, was also involved in the new project. Palmer said the project would not include a casino or gambling: \\"Our focus is on the guest experience, not walking them through a casino and getting them to game.\\" The hotel was to have a sky lounge, event space on the top floor, a night club and cigar bar, and three restaurants, including the first sushi bar to be owned by Palmer. Amenities would include a health spa, a hair salon, sommelier service, and a 24-hour concierge service. =New location= By May 2007, the project's proposed location was moved to Union Park, an undeveloped 61-acre property in downtown Las Vegas that was subsequently renamed Symphony Park. In December 2008, Palmer still planned to proceed with the project, with an opening scheduled for November 2011, to coincide with the opening of the adjacent Smith Center for the Performing Arts. At the time, the project was to consist of 426 rooms; no condominium aspect was specified for the project. The hotel would be located on of land located north of the Smith Center. Richard Kaufman, the president of City-Core Development and a partner with The Charlie Palmer Group, was involved with the project at that time as a developer. In February 2010, the Las Vegas City Council allowed Palmer to delay construction for two to four years, due to a poor economy. Construction had been scheduled to begin later that year. Bill Arent, the director of the city's office of business development, said, \\"We believe this extension is in the best interest of making this project happen. This project was proposed as a hospitality project, a non-gaming hotel. The hospitality market right now in Las Vegas is struggling and is to experience some challenges in a few years to come.\\" Kaufman said, \\"The idea of this hotel is to bring an experience that I don't think exists in Las Vegas, and really concentrating on the non-gaming person who comes to Las Vegas, whether it's for business or recreation or what have you.\\" In March 2011, Kaufman said that the project would remain on hold because of the poor hotel economy. Kaufman also confirmed that condominiums were no longer a part of the project. In March 2012, Kaufman said the project did not have a start date, as he and Palmer were waiting for construction costs to decrease and for hotel-room rates to increase so the project could be financially viable. Kaufman said the project could be built in phases, with the first phase to consist of 50 to 100 rooms and a restaurant by Palmer. The project, at that time, was to include an ultimate total of 371 rooms. Kaufman said one problem in progressing the project was the uncertainty of what type of other nearby projects would be constructed at Symphony Park in the future. In March 2013, the Las Vegas City Council unanimously approved a one-year extension for the start of construction on the project, as Kaufman said room rates had not increased enough for the hotel to operate: \\"The problem is room rates are low so we need to spend less money because we can't charge more. How do we make it more affordable to build?\\" Kaufman said a potential solution would be the construction of a 100-room hotel with a restaurant, with the possibility of expanding the project as part of a later second phase. In September 2013, Palmer confirmed that he still planned to build the hotel but said, \\"The big question there is what's going to happen around that piece of land. Originally there were nine or 10 projects on the slate, and a lot of them fell out. There's been talk of a stadium on the land adjacent to our property. It's hard to build and spend $200 or $300 million on a project not knowing who your neighbors are going to be\\". In September 2014, the project was on hold until a decision was made regarding the proposed stadium in Symphony Park.

The project was announced in 1998, and began construction the following year. The property was developed by Irwin Molasky and Steve Wynn, and was completed in 2001. History The project was announced by developer Irwin Molasky in March 1998, as The Park at Hughes Center. Within a year, the project had been renamed as Park Towers. The project was planned as a $100 million, two-tower condominium project with 84 units; between 30 and 40 percent of the units were already sold out as of February 1999. The project was to be developed by Irwin Molasky and Mark Fine, along with Molasky's three sons, Steven, Andrew and Alan Molasky. The project would be built on of land at the Hughes Center business park on Howard Hughes Parkway, near Flamingo Road and Paradise Road, east of the Las Vegas Strip. Groundbreaking was originally scheduled for fall 1998, but was delayed until April 1999, with construction expected to take 15 months to two years. By July 1999, Steve Wynn had become a developer and designer in the project. Wynn had also purchased a $4 million Park Towers penthouse for himself and his wife, Elaine Wynn. Irwin Molasky stated that Wynn \\"helped with the design and placement\\" of the project. In September 1999, it was announced that French bank Société Générale, as well as the Bank of Nova Scotia, would provide $70 million in construction financing to the project, which was expected to cost $120 million. Construction was scheduled to begin that month, with completion expected in the fourth quarter of 2000. Site preparation was 95-percent complete. In February 2000, construction was scheduled for completion that September. The project's website featured 24-hour camera footage recording the towers' construction. Planned for the property were elevators that would not move before scanning each resident's security card. The first residents began occupying the property in March 2001. By May 2001, Wynn had sold his Park Towers penthouse to Marc Schorr, an executive for MGM Mirage. Completion of the project was celebrated in July 2001. The project was developed through Irwin Molasky's High Rise JV LLC. Portions of the project were designed by JMA Architecture Studios. $1 million was spent on landscaping. Prices for units at Park Towers ranged from $750,000 to $5 million. Shaquille O'Neal considered purchasing a unit at Park Towers. In July 2001, J.A. Jones Construction, the general contractor for the project, filed an arbitration claim and an $18.9 million lien on the project, alleging insufficient payment. High Rise JV stated that the work for which the construction company did not receive payment was either incomplete or not up to the developer's standards. John Bond, president of J.A. Jones Construction, denied the claims and said, \\"We complied with every direction of the developer from the inception to the completion.\\" Bond also said that several design plans for the project were changed late in development, increasing the cost and amount of work. In August 2001, after J.A. Construction cancelled a meeting that was to be held with High Rise JV, the development company filed a lawsuit to reduce the price of the lien to $3.2 million, the amount of money owed to the construction company. The lien was reduced in September 2001. Park Towers, along with Turnberry Place, inspired a condominium boom in Las Vegas that began in 2003. As of 2011, Irwin Molasky lived in a penthouse suite at Park Towers. In March 2013, Schorr, now the retiring chief operating officer for Wynn Resorts, listed his , two-story penthouse for sale at a price of $9.8 million.

Background The Syrian Army captured the Palmyra Triangle area, Palmyra Castle, Qatari Castle, and al-Amriyah village, as well as many hilltops including Jabbal Hayyal and Jabbal al-Tar after an assault on 1 March. On the same day, the Syrian army and allies backed by warplanes, had entered to the modern city of Palmyra and captured the al-Motaqadin street after captured the western and northern western sections of the city amid information about pulling back by ISIL from the city. On the next day, ISIL launched a failed counter-attack following which SAA attacked and imposed full control over Jabal al-Tar and Palmyra Castle. ISIL later withdrew from most of Palmyra, after they mined many points in the city. However, they left behind suicide bombers in the eastern districts of Palmyra, to cover the retreat of the ISIL militants, and to hamper the progress of the Syrian Army. On 2 March, the Syrian Army recaptured the entire city of Palmyra, after ISIL fully withdrew from the city. On the next day, the Syrian Army captured the Palmyra Airport, and completely secured it on 4 March, after ISIL was forced to retreat to the Palmyra Grain Silos to the east of the airport. The offensive =Army advances north of Palmyra; Jazal oil fields captured= On 5 March 2017, the Syrian Army captured all hills to the south of the Jazal oil fields, to the northwest of the city of Palmyra. They later attacked the oil fields as well, forcing ISIL to withdraw. The group set the oil fields on fire while retreating. On the next day, the Syrian army secured the entirety of the Jazal Oil Fields and captured the adjacent Jazal mountain. On 7 March, the Syrian Army captured Al-Amriyah Mountain and the surrounding hills, securing the fire control over the Palmyra Grain Silos. On 13 March, the Syrian army captured the Palmyra Electrical Station and Sabkhat al Muh area south of the city of Palmyra. On the same day, the Syrian army captured the Palmyra Grain Silos. They also captured the Wadi al-Ahmar area furing the same day. On 14 March, the Syrian Army captured the Mustadirah Mountains in northeastern Palmyra. Later, the Syrian army captured the Mustadirah Gas Fields during the early hours. On 15 March, the Syrian Army reached the strategic Talilah Crossroad where clashes took place. The next day, the Syrian Army captured the mountain of Jabal Mazar, the adjacent Hajjana Storage Base, Palmyra Gas Fields and officially secured all high points around the city of Palmyra. On 17 March, the Syrian Army launched another attack on the Al-Talilah Crossroad and Al-‘Antar Mountains. Two days later, government troops captured the mountain ridge located north of the recently captured Jabal Mazar. This gave them fire-control of the nearby Al- Hurm Mountains in the northern Palmyra countryside. Later in the day, the 5th Legion of the Syrian Army also secured the Talialh Mountains some 20 kilometres south-west of Palmyra. On 23 March, ISIL attacked one of the Syrian Army outposts to the east of Palmyra killing four soldiers. The attack was eventually repelled by the newly-created elite unit ISIL Hunters who killed 24 attackers and wounded 12. An ISIL vehicle was also destroyed. On 27 March, the Army captured four mountains and Brigade 550 Base and several other points to the north of Palmyra. These advances moved the government closer to resolving its long-standing energy crisis amid reports that ISIL had withdrawn from the Jirah and Sha’er Gas Fields not long after the Syrian Army captured the mountaintops northwest of Palmyra. It launched a new assault in the eastern countryside of Palmyra on 31 March, targeting the road to the strategic Arak gas fields. The SAA seized some points on the Palmyra-Sukhnah road during the day. The SAA captured the Abu al-Duhur mountain in eastern Homs on 2 April. The capture of Abu al-Duhur gave them fire control over Abu Qulah dam and Wadi Al-Hissu. Jabal al-Taj was also reported to have been captured by the Syrian Army. On 4 April, they captured an area of a mountain chain north of Palmyra overlooking the Arak gas fields. After the Tomahawk missile strike on Shayrat Air Base carried out by the United States, ISIL launched attacks on Syrian Army defenses in Palmyra, taking advantage of absence of Syrian Air Force in eastern Homs. It attacked the checkpoints outside the village of al-Furqalas, however the attack was repelled with the Homs-Palmyra road secured. =Army advances south of Palmyra= On 7 April, the Syrian Army advanced several kilometers along the M-90 highway, south of Palmyra, capturing farms, a quarry, and a racing runway. The advance cut one of ISIL's supply lines in the region. Three days later, the military captured the ISIL positions in the eastern parts of the Al-Abtar Mountains and reportedly reached the Sawwanah Junction, while pushing towards the Khunayfis Phosphate Mines. On 11 April, they advanced in the areas of Al-Abtar Mountains, Matla’ al-Sukkar and Qasr al-Halabat.Army establishes control over al-Abtar Mountain in Homs Countryside, inflicts heavy losses upon terrorists in different areas =Renewed northern advances; al-Shaer gas fields captured= Amaq News Agency claimed on 14 April that ISIL had killed 11 Syrian soldiers near Sabkha al- Mawah in eastern Palmyra. On 18 April, SAA's 5th Legion along with the 18th Tank Division captured the Abu Qilla Dam. On 24 April, the SAA led by the ISIL Hunters captured several points overlooking the al-Shaer gas fields. On 26 April, it captured al-Shawr gas fields as well as all the hills overlooking it. On 27 April, SAA led by the 5th Legion and assisted by Russian helicopters captured the abandoned Armored Battalion base, expanding on the gains made a day before when they captured Shaer Gas Fields. During the same day, the Syrian Army also took hold of entire Al-Bayda’a mountain range. On 28 April, the Army captured all of the oil wells in the Shaer Gas Fields. Government forces then started demining the gas fields which were also on fire. =Highway secured Homs-Palmyra; Fighting in the Shumriyah Mountains= On 30 April, the SAA backed by the NDF, captured six villages and two hilltops in northeastern Homs. The advance helped them in securing the Palmyra-Homs highway, the main supply line to Palmyra. ISIL carried out a counterattack on 2 May in the axis between Palmyra silos and Talilah crossroads, with Amaq claiming the group had captured several outposts and had killed 11 soldiers. On 3 May, the SAA captured the Shumriyah Mountains, west of Palmyra, as well as three nearby villages. The next day, pro-government forces captured four positions near the Talilah crossroads. Between 6 and 10 May, the SAA captured six hilltops east of Al-Shumriyah Mountains and near the al-Shaer gas fields.VIDEO: Syrian Army seizes three hills amid offensive pouncing through ISIS heartland in HomsRegime forces advance in areas in the eastern desert of Homs and clashes in the countryside of al-Salamiyah On 12 May, the SAA, backed by the Russian Air Force, captured the entire Talilah area. They also captured the quarries to the east of al-Shumriyah Mountains, in addition to the Maqla’ Al-Mushairifah Al-Janoubi area, thus imposing fire control over the road linking the villages of Jubab Hamad, Rasm Hamida and Habrah Al-Gharbiyah.

He was the Secretary of Housing of Puerto Rico until January 19, 2020. He was appointed in 2017 by Governor Ricardo Rosselló and fired for loss of Confidence by Wanda Vázquez in 2020, current Governor of Puerto Rico. Gil-Enseñat was born in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. Before being appointed Secretary, he served as the Associated Administrator for acquisition and contracting in the Public Housing Administration of Puerto Rico. Fernando Gil has a Bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez, a Juris Doctor from the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico and studies at master's degree in private international law at Washington College of Law. In February 2019, Gil-Enseñat was also answering questions as to why the Foundation for Puerto Rico received a large block of the grant money for rebuilding and reconstructing without going through a normal bidding process. As of September 2019, two years after Hurricane Maria, Gil-Enseñat was negotiating the distribution of funds for island reconstruction and relief for homeowners who lost their homes or home's roof. Release of funds has been mired in delays: first by a U.S. government shutdown, then by HUD wanting to audit the administration of funds after Governor Ricardo Rosselló's Telegate scandal and resignation. Recommendations for how to satisfy eligibility requirements for the CDBG-DR (what the grant is called) were recommended in a letter addressed to Gil-Enseñat, in March 2018, by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. While hundreds of thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed— repairing or replacing the roofs is a monumental undertaking in any situation, but one that is particularly daunting in Puerto Rico, where many homes are built “informally,” without permits or titles. Qualifying for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s individual assistance program requires proof of homeownership, leaving many hurricane survivors ineligible because they have no deeds, leases, or mortgages. Gil-Enseñat was quoted as saying that until a recent meeting, treatment of Puerto Rico seemed unfair and discriminatory and that many of the requirements make accessing the relief funds extremely difficult.

Park Towers and Turnberry Place, two high-rise condominium properties located near the Las Vegas Strip, were completed in 2001; they subsequently inspired a condominium boom that started in 2003, when various developers began announcing projects that were planned throughout the Las Vegas Valley. Many projects were ultimately cancelled because of a rise in construction costs, as well as a lack of skilled construction workers and contractors who were qualified to build high-rises; both reasons were attributed to the large number of projects being announced. The following list includes notable condominium projects that were both completed and cancelled, as well as projects that are on hold. History =Early history= Regency Towers, built in 1974, was the first high-rise condominium property to open in the Las Vegas Valley, with 226-units. The property was initially unsuccessful, selling only eight units before going into foreclosure. In the late 1990s, Las Vegas was the fastest-growing area in the United States. As a result, five new high- rise condominium projects were being planned for the Las Vegas Valley in 1998, for a total of 12 new condominium towers. Among the five proposed projects was Turnberry Place and Park Towers. =Condominium boom= High-rise condominiums became a popular trend in the Las Vegas Valley after the opening of Turnberry Place and Park Towers in 2001. Numerous high-rise condominium projects were subsequently announced beginning in 2003, starting a condominium boom. Real estate experts predicted that only 20 to 50 percent of the announced projects would actually get built. The condo-hotel concept was introduced in the Las Vegas Valley in September 2003, at MonteLago Village at Lake Las Vegas. At the end of the year, plans were underway for the first high-rise condominium in downtown Las Vegas: Soho Lofts. The condominium boom was sometimes referred to as the \\"Manhattanization of Las Vegas\\". The term was first used in 1999, by Steve Bottfeld, the owner of a Las Vegas real estate consulting firm. The term was popularized by Richard Lee – director of public relations for First American Title Company – after he used it during a presentation. Lee was a well-known local proponent of the high-rise condominium boom, and spoke frequently about it at local conferences and seminars. Lee had used the term as early as 2003; it was later used as the title for Manhattanizing Las Vegas, a 2005 book by Paul Murad that chronicled the Las Vegas condominium boom. A website called Manhattanization.com was also created to cover the local high- rise market. By January 2005, 122 high-rise condominium buildings with a total of nearly 17,000 units had been announced. The tallest proposed project was the 73-story Summit, which also had the most expensive price listed for a unit: $35 million. The lowest price was $139,900 for units at the 51-story Las Vegas Central. New condominium projects, when completed, were expected to create an increase in visitation to local casinos. Many of the proposed high- rise condominiums were to be built along the Las Vegas Strip in hopes of maximizing buyer interest. The Krystle Sands high-rise, to be built on the Las Vegas Strip, became the first of the newly proposed condominium projects to be cancelled, in March 2005. By May 2005, there were plans for approximately 25,000 condominium units and 8,300 condo-hotel units in the Las Vegas Valley. Some condominium projects were aided by the publicity of celebrities who purchased units in them. As of December 2005, at least 70 condominium towers had been announced for the Las Vegas Valley during the previous 12 months. Multiple projects had been cancelled up to that point. Some developers sold their land to make back a profit. Most of the surviving condo projects were those situated on and near the Las Vegas Strip. Many projects were cancelled because of rising construction costs, as well as a lack of skilled construction workers and contractors who were capable of building high-rise structures. The rising costs and limited workers were both attributed to the large number of high-rise condominium projects that were being planned. While most of the cancelled condominium projects did not have difficulty selling, their respective developers could not build the projects at a suitable cost due to construction expenses rising 30 percent to 50 percent. In February 2006, representatives from six projects announced the formation of the Las Vegas High Rise and Condominium Alliance, which would promote the mid-rise and high-rise condominium market in Las Vegas. In April 2006, Murad – who was planning the 39-story Gateway Las Vegas condominium tower – stated that Las Vegas had entered its second phase of \\"Manhattanization\\", saying, \\"This first phase of Manhattanizing is over. Now we're entering the second phase. What happened in Las Vegas over the last few years is amazing, going from a couple of high rises to a hundred. That hasn't happened anywhere else in the world.\\" The Platinum and The Signature at MGM Grand, the first projects near the Las Vegas Strip to offer condo-hotel units, were completed in 2006. By that point, after the cancellations of several high-rise condominium projects, banks had become more resistant to developers who were seeking construction financing for proposed projects. Two banks were heavily involved in Las Vegas' high-rise condominium market at that time: Corus Bank and Hypo Real Estate Corporation. Corus had $770 million of its loan portfolio allocated to Las Vegas condominium projects, while Hypo had approximately $850 million allocated to such projects. During 2006, multiple condominium projects were under construction in downtown Las Vegas. Mayor Oscar Goodman, who was elected in 1999, had made it a priority to revitalize the downtown area. Sky Las Vegas, finished in 2007, was the first high-rise condominium to be completed on the Las Vegas Strip. =Economic downturn and resurgence= Sales of high-rise condominiums began to decrease in 2008. The condo-hotel market, consisting of projects on and near the Las Vegas Strip, also suffered that year because of low sales; thousands of condo-hotel units had been cancelled up to that point. By the end of 2008, only three additional developers had successfully completed condominium high-rises near the Las Vegas Strip: MGM Mirage (The Signature), Donald Trump (Trump International), and Andrew Fonfa (Allure Las Vegas). In 2009, condominium and condo-hotel units on and near the Las Vegas Strip were still struggling to sell because of the financial crisis of 2007–2008. As of August 2009, less than 25 percent of the proposed condominium projects had been built, as predicted by some analysts; developers of projects that were completed were having difficulty selling their units as a result of the 2008 recession. Sales of high-rise condominiums increased seven percent in the third quarter of 2009, although condo-hotels continued to struggle. Poor condominium sales continued into the following year. In June 2010, there were 5,500 high-rise condominium units and 5,400 condo-hotel units in the Las Vegas Valley. By that point, developers of several high-rise condominium properties had begun renting their vacant units, which were left unsold because of the poor economy. Sales of high-rise condominiums had increased in 2011, with many units being sold at a reduced cost through bank sales, short sales, and foreclosures to investors, who would subsequently improve and flip the units. The largest increase occurred at properties on and near the Las Vegas Strip. However, sales of new condominiums were down, and the condo-hotel market also continued to suffer. High-rise sales were expected to increase in 2015 as the market continued to recover. By 2016, the construction industry in Las Vegas had been revived, although there were no plans for any new high-rise condominium projects. Prices for existing high-rise condominiums had increased by that time. Demand for high-rise homes on the Las Vegas Strip was projected to increase because of the opening of the T-Mobile Arena, as well as the announcement of an NHL expansion franchise and discussions about a potential NFL team in Las Vegas. Sales continued to increase through 2018, partly because of the relocation of the Oakland Raiders to Las Vegas. Completed projects =Allure Las Vegas= Allure began construction in 2005. Located west of the Las Vegas Strip, it was completed in December 2007, and was the tallest residential building within Las Vegas city limits at that time, standing 41 stories high with a total of 428 units. The tower was built at a cost of $150 million. A second tower was cancelled because of poor sales in the first tower caused by the Great Recession, and because of an oversupply of condominium high-rises on the Las Vegas Strip. =Boca Raton= Boca Raton consists of two seven-story buildings with a total of 378 units, located south of the Las Vegas Strip. Groundbreaking took place in 2004, and the project ultimately opened in 2007. However, sales were poor due to the Great Recession, and plans for two additional buildings were canceled. =Jockey Club= The Jockey Club is located on the Strip, surrounded on three sides by the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. It consists of two 11-story towers with a total of 348 units. Of those units, 78 are wholly owned as condos, and the remaining 270 are fractionally owned through a timeshare program. Development of the property began in 1972. Sales were initially sluggish, and most of the units were used as short-term rentals for several years. In 1977, the developers began converting units into timeshares. The timeshare program initially included 85 units, and later expanded to include most of the building. A second phase of construction was originally planned to add a third tower with 650 units on 30 floors, as well as a casino, restaurants, and showrooms. The casino was built in 1981, but never opened; instead, the developer went into bankruptcy, and the land was sold off. After a series of ownership changes, the land was bought in 2004 by the developers who would build the Cosmopolitan. They decided to build around the Jockey Club instead of attempting to buy and demolish it because of the estimated $400- to $500-million cost of buying out all of the condo and timeshare owners. =Juhl= Juhl is a mixed-use development project that includes a 15-story condominium tower, in addition to restaurants and retail. It is located in downtown Las Vegas. Construction began in 2006, but the opening was delayed by more than a year, due to construction issues. It ultimately opened in 2009, and buyers initially had trouble finalizing their purchases due to the effects of the Great Recession. Some units were temporarily turned into rentals. =Manhattan= Manhattan condominiums Manhattan is a 700-unit condominium property located on South Las Vegas Boulevard, south of the Las Vegas Strip. It was announced by Gemstone Development in 2004, and was built by Martin- Harris Construction. The project cost $250 million, and the first of several buildings was completed in 2006. The building exteriors were designed to resemble the various architectural styles present in the borough of Manhattan. Units were priced low to appeal to a broad customer base. =Metropolis= Metropolis is a condominium tower with 71 units, located at 360 East Desert Inn Road, east of the Las Vegas Strip. It was built on less than an acre of land, previously occupied by a closed low-rise timeshare known as Royal Aloha. Metropolis was developed by Randall Davis, who had previously developed other properties in Houston. He was attracted to the Las Vegas market following the success of Park Towers and Turnberry Place. The property is named after Davis' Metropolis condominium property in Houston, but it differs in appearance, featuring a 1920s Art Deco design inspired by the Argyle Hotel in California. Davis purchased the land in July 2003, at a cost of $1.9 million. He demolished the Royal Aloha and broke ground on Metropolis in September. Construction began in January 2004, and the project was originally scheduled for completion that November. Although concrete and steel prices increased during construction, Davis chose not to raise prices on the units, ultimately breaking even. The tower was topped off in December 2004, and was opened the following December. =Newport Lofts= Newport Lofts during construction, May 2006 Newport Lofts is a 23-story, 168-unit tower located at 200 Hoover Street in downtown Las Vegas. The project was co-developed by Sam Cherry, who also developed Soho Lofts. In August 2004, Cherry was planning Newport Lofts as a 17-story tower with 131 units, to be built at the northeast corner of Casino Center and Hoover Avenue. The project was a joint venture between Cherry and Seegmiller Partners, a company based in Newport Beach, California, with Clark and West Seegmiller as its principals. The property for the project had been purchased several years earlier by Clark Seegmiller. In October 2004, the Las Vegas City Council approved Newport Lofts as a 22-story tower with 168 units. Groundbreaking was to begin in late May 2005, with completion expected in fall 2006. Reservations began in January 2005, while groundbreaking began in early July 2005, with Breslin Builders as the project's general contractor. Completion was expected for 2007. That month, the project received $81 million in construction financing from George Smith Partners, based in Irving, California. In March 2006, the elevator shaft and center staircase had been built up to the 12th floor, while shear walls were up to the eighth floor. Newport Lofts in 2020 Construction was still underway in August 2007, although some new residents had already begun moving into the building by that time. More than 70 percent of the building's units had been sold up to that point. Construction concluded at a cost of $115 million. Corus Bank helped financed the project for $67.1 million. West Seegmiller said Newport Lofts was designed with a Southern California theme, as its target demographic was California residents who desired to purchase a second home in Las Vegas. In 2007, Newport Lofts won a Mayor's Urban Design Award. In January 2008, an auction of 60 units was cancelled after Pyramis Global Advisors – a division of Fidelity Investments – took over management of the building. Condo prices at Newport Lofts were decreased 30 percent later that year. At the end of 2008, artist Brett Sperry opened the Brett Wesley Gallery inside his penthouse at Newport Lofts. When Corus Bank failed in September 2009, the property was acquired by ST Residential. In April 2011, ST Residential announced that the last of Newport Lofts' units had been sold to buyers. =One Las Vegas= One Las Vegas consists of two 20-story towers, located south of the Las Vegas Strip.

A third tower, standing 45 stories, was renamed as The Martin in 2011, and received a $3 million renovation to increase sales. The complex is located west of Interstate 15 and CityCenter. =Park Towers= Park Towers is a two-tower, 20-story condominium property with 84 units, located east of the Las Vegas Strip. Park Towers was announced by developer Irwin Molasky in 1998, and began construction the following year, with Steve Wynn as a co-developer. The project was completed in 2001. =Regency Towers= Regency Towers is located at 3111 Bel Air Drive, at the Las Vegas Country Club in Winchester, Nevada. Regency Towers was built in 1974, and was the first high-rise condominium property to open in the Las Vegas Valley, standing 28 stories with 226 units. Only eight of the units sold after opening, before the property went into foreclosure. Irwin Molasky, who was among the eight buyers, later purchased the entire structure and renovated it before ultimately selling the remaining units. Regency Towers was designed by Las Vegas architect Homer A. Rissman, who also lived at the property for years. In March 2001, approximately 80 residents were evacuated after the explosion of a meth lab operated by a resident inside one of the condominiums. In March 2007, six weeks of filming began at Regency Towers for the second season of the television series HGTV Design Star. The season was shot inside the penthouse formerly owned by Molasky. Notable tenants at Regency Towers have included George Carlin, Don Miguel Ruiz, Hank Greenspun and his wife, Shaun King, musician Larry Hart, Norm Clarke, casino executive Burton Cohen, Russian-art collector Dr. Rupert Perrin, Sandra Murphy, and Anthony Spilotro. Moe Dalitz owned a penthouse unit until his death there in 1989; his unit, which included his furniture and books, was for sale in 2002 at a cost of $1.2 million. Also for sale at that time was Rodney Dangerfield's unit, at a cost of $275,000. Actress Debbie Reynolds, who purchased a condominium unit on the 12th floor in 1974, put her unit up for sale in 2011, at a cost of $269,900. La Toya Jackson owned a unit from 1996 until 2009, when it was foreclosed. =Sky Las Vegas= Sky Las Vegas is a 45-story tower with 409 condominium units that is located on the Las Vegas Strip. Sky Las Vegas was announced in July 2004, and was opened in May 2007, becoming the first high-rise condominium project to be completed on the Las Vegas Strip. =Soho Lofts= Soho Lofts in 2020 Soho Lofts, named after the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo, is a 16-story condominium tower with 112 units, located within the city's arts district at 900 South Las Vegas Boulevard in downtown Las Vegas. The project was developed by Sam Cherry, who also developed Newport Lofts. Cherry and his father-in-law, Harris Rittoff, were planning Soho Lofts in December 2003. JMA Architecture Studios designed the project. Soho Lofts was to be built at a cost of $40 million to $50 million, on of vacant property at the southwest corner of South Las Vegas Boulevard and Hoover Avenue. It was the first high- rise condominium project to be announced for the downtown area. Groundbreaking was scheduled for May 2004. The project was to include of ground-level retail space. The property was purchased in January 2004, at a cost of $1.2 million. The project's general contractor was Breslin Builders. Digging for the building's support columns began in July 2004. Construction was expected to cost $60 million. Crews were preparing to begin the structure's foundation work in October 2004. Occupancy was initially expected for early December 2005. Occupancy was later expected for February 2006, although construction was ongoing in April 2006. In May 2006, an automobile dealership – for Lamborghinis, Ferraris, and Rolls-Royces – was being planned for the building's ground floor, while residents were expected to begin occupying the building later that month. In December 2007, a lease was signed for the Dust Contemporary Fine Art gallery to occupy a space inside Soho Lofts. The gallery opened two months later. The Globe Salon was the first business to occupy Soho Lofts' commercial space, beginning in July 2008; the rest of the space remained vacant because of the poor economy. By 2009, the Naomi Arin Contemporary Art gallery was operating inside Soho Lofts. In January 2011, a small grocery store, Resnicks Grocery, opened inside a space inside Soho Lofts that was previously occupied by an art gallery. A lounge, known as The Lady Silvia, opened inside Soho Lofts in July 2011. The Amanda Harris Gallery opened inside Soho Lofts in January 2012. The Contemporary Arts Center later operated from within one of Soho Loft's ground-level spaces. =The Ogden= The Ogden, located in downtown Las Vegas, was initially opened as the Streamline Tower in May 2008. It opened with 275 condominium units in a 21-story tower, although sales suffered as a result of the weak local and national economy. The units were converted into apartments in 2010, and the property was renamed as The Ogden a year later. In 2014, The Ogden was converted back into condominiums. =The Platinum= The Platinum is a 17-story, 255-unit condo hotel built on of land, east of the Las Vegas Strip. The project was developed by Platinum Condominium Development, LLC, a joint venture of Diversified Real Estate Concepts, Inc. and Marcus Hotels and Resorts. Construction began in 2005, and the project opened in October 2006. =The Signature at MGM Grand= The Signature in 2015 The Signature is a condo hotel located near the MGM Grand Las Vegas resort. The project was jointly developed by MGM Mirage and Turnberry Associates, and opened in 2006, on the former land of MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park. =Trump International= Trump International in 2008 Trump International is located near the Las Vegas Strip. Groundbreaking took place in 2005. The 64-floor tower was built on of property that had been used as part of the Frontier's rear parking lot. The project cost $500 million, and was opened in 2008, with a total of 1,282 condominium units and hotel rooms. A second tower had been planned, but was postponed due to poor economic conditions. Construction of the second tower had been expected to begin in late 2008. =Turnberry Place= Turnberry Place in 2006 Turnberry Place was announced in June 1998, and consists of four 40-story condominium towers located east of the Las Vegas Strip. =Turnberry Towers= Turnberry Towers is a two-tower property near the Las Vegas Strip. The towers stand 45 stories and contain a total of 636 units. =Vdara= Vdara is a condo hotel located within CityCenter on the Las Vegas Strip. It opened in December 2008, and includes 1,495 units. =Veer Towers= Veer Towers, also located within CityCenter, consists of twin towers that stand 37 stories high and include 670 condominium units. The towers opened in July 2010. =Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas= The Waldorf Astoria hotel includes 225 condominiums and is located within CityCenter. It was opened in December 2009 as the Mandarin Oriental, and rebranded as the Waldorf Astoria in 2018. On hold =St. Regis Residences= An unfinished condominium tower, known as \\"The St. Regis Residences at the Venetian Palazzo, Las Vegas\\", is located on the Las Vegas Strip, between the Palazzo and Venetian resorts. Construction was underway in 2007, and the opening was eventually scheduled for March 2010. The tower was to stand 50 stories, with a total of 398 condominium units. The project was expected to cost $600 million, but construction was indefinitely suspended in November 2008 because of the Great Recession. In 2014, the project was no longer expected to be finished as a condominium tower because of uncertainty in the high-end, high-rise residential market. Up to that point, several other options had been considered regarding the building's future use. Cancelled projects =Ambling Development Company project= In 2004, the Atlanta-based Ambling Development Company held meetings with mayor Oscar Goodman, councilman Lawrence Weekly, and other city officials regarding a condominium project. Ambling was planning a complex of three 28-story condominium towers with a total of 840 units, to be built at a cost of $330 million on at the northwest corner of Alta Drive and South Martin Luther King Boulevard. The land had previously been occupied by a gas station, which was later burned down during a riot. Ambling invested $2 million to acquire the land, to open a Las Vegas office, and to perform initial design work. Months later, on December 15, 2004, the City Council voted unanimously to reject Ambling's project because of opposition from nearby residents, who believed that the tall modern-style glass buildings would not go well with the neighborhood's southwestern theme and its 600 single-story houses. Residents also believed the new project would create traffic problems and overcrowd nearby schools. Weekly criticized city staff members, alleging that they misled Ambling to believe that their project was guaranteed to be approved by the City Council. The manager of the city's Economic Development division, who had worked with Ambling on their project, resigned from his position two days after the vote. In June 2005, Ambling was unanimously approved by the City Council for a smaller version of its initial project to be constructed on the same property. The new project was to consist of three nine-story buildings and one five-story building, with retail space and a total of 664 condominium units. The project was to be built in phases, with construction planned to begin at the end of 2005, and the first phase being potentially completed in 2007. The project was ultimately cancelled due to further opposition from nearby residents. The land was subsequently sold in February 2006. =Aqua Blue= By December 2004, the newly created high-rise development division of Prudential Americana Group Realtors was planning Aqua Blue, a luxury condominium-hotel project. Aqua Blue was the division's flagship project, with gross sales expected to exceed $550 million. The project was approved that year, and was to be constructed east of the Las Vegas Strip near the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane, on of property that was occupied at the time by a Super 8 motel, located adjacent to the Ellis Island Casino & Brewery. The motel was to be demolished to make room for Aqua Blue, while Ellis Island would continue operations but would receive an exterior renovation to match the appearance of the new project. Aqua Blue would have included a casino that would be operated by Gary Ellis, who owned the Ellis Island. Ellis decided to become involved in the Aqua Blue after meeting with the project's developer, Michael Peterson, who had developed and owned condominiums and restaurants in Wisconsin and Chicago. Aqua Blue was to stand 46 stories, and would have included 825 units, priced between $399,000 and $1,125,000. The project's expected cost was $600 million. Construction was expected to begin in fall 2005, and its opening was expected to occur by fall 2007. In January 2005, retired basketball player Michael Jordan became involved in Aqua Blue. Jordan was to open two restaurants at Aqua Blue: Michael Jordon's Steak House and Michael Jordon's 23 Sportcafe. Jordan would also open the Michael Jordan Athletic Center inside the new building. In June 2005, Peterson began considering offers for the property. After three weeks, Peterson announced on June 29, 2005, that the project had been cancelled due to a large increase of proposed nearby condominium projects and a lack of buyers to sustain the increase. The property was sold to David Schwartz and his Chicago-based company, Waterton Associates, with plans to keep the Super 8 motel operational. =Champions of Las Vegas= Champions of Las Vegas was to consist of a 21-story tower with 844 condominium units that would be priced at approximately $1 million each. The project was being planned in 1995, and by March 1998, it had received approval by the Clark County Commission. The project was to be located near the southern entrance to Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. As of 1998, the project was scheduled for completion in 2006, because of the necessity to perform extensive infrastructure work on the property. =Charlie Palmer Hotel= The Charlie Palmer Hotel was announced by chef Charlie Palmer in April 2006. The project was to include a 35-story boutique condo hotel with 400 to 500 rooms, and initially was to be built at the intersection of Tropicana Avenue and Dean Martin Drive. The $400 million project was scheduled to break ground later in 2006, with completion expected for mid-2008. The project's proposed location was later changed to Symphony Park in downtown Las Vegas, with the condominium aspect removed. =Cielo Vista= In March 2005, the Seattle-based Northwest Resource Management Group filed plans with the city of Las Vegas for Cielo Vista, a 25-story condominium tower with 414 units, as well as of commercial space on the first floor. Above the first floor would be six floors used for parking, and 18 floors for condominium units. The project was designed by Las Vegas-based MWT Ofra, and was scheduled for a vote by the Las Vegas Planning Commission and the City Council in May and June 2005, respectively. Cielo Vista would have been the company's first Las Vegas project. The company had previously developed single-family residential homes in California, as well as an 11-story building in Seattle. Cielo Vista was to be built at the southeast corner of East Washington Avenue and Veterans Memorial Drive, west of Cashman Field and north of downtown Las Vegas, on a 2.8-acre site that the company purchased for $1.2 million on March 29, 2005. A local expert believed that the project was in a bad location: an older part of Las Vegas with little development. The area was also known for a high rate of crime and homelessness; Steve Hartley, a partner for Northwest Resource Management Group, said the company had previously developed a project in California that had similar demographics. The low price of the land allowed the company to sell condominium units ranging from to at a starting price of $295,000, and exceeding $500,000. Condominium units in the project could be reserved for a refundable fee of $5,000, compared to a $25,000 fee that was being charged by some other high-rise condominium projects in the city. Construction was expected to begin in late 2005, as long as the project received approval from the city. Completion was expected by early 2007. The project received unanimous approval from the Las Vegas Planning Commission in June 2005. At the time, 155 units had been reserved. Three months after the announcement of Cielo Vista, Northwest Resource suspended sales and delayed the project because of rising construction costs, choosing instead to wait until it was further along in the construction cost process before beginning sales; 300 units had been reserved up to that point, and some buyers received a refund. As final construction costs were being determined in March 2006, Eric Radovich, Northwest Resource's managing director of public relations and marketing, said, \\"We're getting close to a number and we think it's real. We didn't feel we could tell people truthfully what the product was going to cost and whether we can afford to build it.\\" The project never materialized. =Club Renaissance= Club Renaissance was announced in 2005, and would have been built in downtown Las Vegas. It would consist of a 60-story tower, and was planned as the least-expensive high-rise condominium in the Las Vegas Valley. The tower, expected to be 702 feet high, was one of the taller high- rise projects to be approved for the downtown area. The project was affected by rising construction costs, and it ultimately did not materialize. =Elysium= By 2008, ex-NBA player Jackie Robinson and real estate veteran Michael Bellon had teamed up to develop a multibillion-dollar project on Bulloch and Gaffin's property called Elysium. It called for condos and hotel rooms, a dome-covered ocean-beach swimming complex, and more. It was to be located on the southeast of the Las Vegas Strip.https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/abandoned-property-on-las-vegas- strip-for-sale-again-1950957/amp/ https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/jackie- robinson-1000-committed-to-las-vegas-strip-arena-hotel-project-1817247/ https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/tourism/california-developer-plans- luxury-hotel-on-south-strip-1959977/ =Fontainebleau Las Vegas= Fontainebleau Las Vegas was to include a casino, 2,871 hotel rooms, and 1,018 condominium units. Construction began on the Las Vegas Strip in 2007, but ceased in 2009, the year of its planned opening. Investment firms Witkoff Group and New Valley LLC purchased the unfinished resort in 2017. The following year, Witkoff and Marriott International announced a partnership to open the renamed project as The Drew Las Vegas. The resort will include a casino and three hotels totaling nearly 4,000 rooms, with the condominium aspect removed from the project. =Icon= In November 2004, Jorge M. Pérez and The Related Companies were planning Icon, a twin-tower condominium project to be built on of property, located on the Las Vegas Strip at the northeast corner of Convention Center Drive. The land was located east of a Ross department store, and the project would be built behind the store. Related purchased the vacant land in January 2004, at a cost of $15 million. The land had previously been owned by Luke Brugnara, who also owned the adjacent Silver City Casino. Initially, Icon was to include two 47-story towers, standing 500 feet, with a total of 502 luxury condominiums, all facing the Las Vegas Strip. Two-thirds of the project's units would include views on both sides of the buildings for views of the Las Vegas Strip and nearby mountains. Unit prices would start at $500,000. The $30 million project was designed by Bernardo Fort Brescia of Arquitectonica, which teamed up with interior designer Yabu Pushelberg for the project. Construction on the first tower was to begin in 2005, with work on the second tower scheduled to begin after the first was completed. By April 2005, the project had been redesigned after Lorenzo Doumani, developer of the adjacent Majestic Las Vegas, raised concerns about the Icon blocking views for tenants at the Majestic, among other issues. By that time, M.J. Dean had signed on as the general contractor for Icon, and the first tower was expected to take 18 to 24 months to construct. At that point, the towers were expected to be 48 stories high, with a total of 514 units. The Clark County Commission approved Icon in April 2005, despite objections from Doumani, who then filed lawsuits against Related. Later that month, a lawsuit was filed against Related by Sasson Hallier Properties LLC, developer of Panorama Towers. The two companies had previously negotiated a possible joint venture for the Panorama Towers project, and Sasson Hallier provided various database information – including contracts, financials, and marketing information – to Related as part of the negotiations. Ultimately, negotiations failed, and Sasson Hallier alleged that Related kept the database information to develop its Icon project. In January 2006, Related announced the cancellation of Icon despite that buyers had signed contracts for most of the project's 514 units. Related stated, \\"In the several months needed to resolve lawsuits and finally be in a position to break ground, construction prices had increased so drastically that after pursuing every possible way to move forward, Related was unable to build Icon based on original pricing without seriously impacting the integrity of the development.\\" A decrease in high-rise sales was also a factor in the cancellation. In May 2006, a lawsuit was filed by buyers against Related, stating that the company had no right to cancel purchase agreements for Icon's units. =Krystle Sands= Krystle Sands would have featured a 45-story condo hotel, to be built on the Las Vegas Strip. Construction was to begin in 2004, but developer F.W. \\"Freddie\\" Schinz eventually sold the land to Turnberry Associates, which used the site for part of its Fontainebleau resort. =Las Ramblas= Las Ramblas was announced in 2005, as a joint project between Centra Properties and The Related Companies. The $3 billion project was planned as a mixed-use complex that would have included 11 high-rise buildings, which would be used for hotel rooms and condominiums, with a total of 4,400 units. Las Ramblas was to be built east of the Las Vegas Strip on Harmon Avenue. Later in 2005, actor George Clooney and nightclub developer Rande Gerber announced that they would invest in the project. Because of a declining market and rising construction costs, Las Ramblas was cancelled in 2006, before the start of construction. =Las Vegas Plaza= Las Vegas Plaza was planned as a multibillion-dollar resort on the site of the demolished New Frontier hotel and casino. The project was to include 2,600 condominium units. The project never materialized, and in 2014, the property was sold to Crown Resorts, which planned to build the Alon Las Vegas on the site. =Liberty Tower / Monument / Stratorise= Liberty Tower was announced in June 2004, as a 21-story building to be built on at 1801 South Las Vegas Boulevard, at the southern end of downtown Las Vegas. The project would be located north of the Stratosphere tower and near the Las Vegas Arts District, on land that was purchased for $900,000. The project was designed by JMA Architecture Studios and was to be developed by Harvard Securities of Australia. Groundbreaking was expected by November 2004, with completion occurring a year and a half later at a cost of $35 million. In August 2004, the 21-story project was approved by the Las Vegas City Council to include 18 condominium units, 116 apartments, and of ground-level retail space. That month, it was announced that Australian developers Joseph Di Mauro and Victor Altomare would finance the project, which they also planned to do for The Summit. By January 2005, the closed Holy Cow Casino and Brewery (the planned future site of The Summit) had been converted into a $1 million sales office for Liberty Tower. At that time, construction on the project was expected to begin in July 2005, with a cost of $100 million. Construction of Liberty Tower never began. In December 2005, Altomare sold the property for $5.5 million to Stratorise South, a limited liability company based in Nevada. That month, plans were announced for a $105 million condominium project called Monument to be built on the property. The project was to be 22 stories, with 236 units, and was to be developed by Constellation Property Group, an Australia-based company owned by Eugene Marchese, with financing by partner David Rifkind. By August 2006, a new project known as Stratorise was being planned for the property. The project would stand 517 feet, and would include 45 stories. In September 2006, a hearing on the proposed project was delayed until November 1, 2006, at the request of the owner. =Majestic Las Vegas= Majestic Las Vegas was announced in 2004, and was to be built on the property occupied by the La Concha Motel on the Las Vegas Strip. Majestic Las Vegas initially was to consist of a 42-story tower, although the project later went through several redesigns, before being cancelled in 2007. =ManhattanWest= ManhattanWest was a mixed-use project that was to include 700 condominium units upon completion. It was proposed by Gemstone Development, which also created the Manhattan project. Construction was suspended in 2008, because of financial problems, and the project was ultimately finished as The Gramercy, with the condominium units opening as apartment rentals instead. =One Las Vegas / Vegas 888= In August 2004, Chris DelGuidice, who was developing Vegas Grand through his Del American company, announced plans for a second project to be known as One Las Vegas. The project would include a 565-foot 50-story condominium tower with 542 units, to be built at a cost of $500 million on 10 acres of land on Flamingo Road, east of the Palms Casino Resort. DelGuidice negotiated for a year and a half to purchase the property. Early design plans included a 400-foot waterfall, rooftop hot tubs, a dance floor, a gourmet grocer, restaurants, a pool with cabanas, a health spa on the 35th floor, valet and housekeeping services, 24-hour concierge, a pet park, and a business center. Sales were expected to begin in early 2005, with prices starting at $500,000 and exceeding $10 million. Groundbreaking was reported to be a year away. The following month, construction was scheduled to begin in summer 2005. The project was to be financed by Lehman Brothers, with a loan of up to $79.45 million. Lehman Brothers also financed Vegas Grand. Del American closed escrow on the property in January 2005, at a cost of $50 million. In February 2005, Amland Development took legal action against Del American to continue using the name for its own condominium project, also known as One Las Vegas. Amland Development won the right to use the name. In November 2005, Del American announced that the project would be named Vegas 888. The sales office for Vegas 888 closed in July 2006, at which point the property was reportedly for sale. Approximately $250 million worth of condominium units had been presold, with approximately $75 million spent on the project, most of which came from Lehman Brothers. In August 2006, Del American announced intentions to instead build a mixed-use resort, hotel and casino on the property. The new project remained un-built. In 2007, the property was foreclosed and acquired by Lehman Brothers. Christopher Beavor, a Las Vegas investor, purchased the property in 2016, at a cost of $13.5 million. Beavor's initial, unfinalized plans included retail space, a five-story apartment complex, and a hotel, with construction expected to begin in six to seven months. Ultimately, Beavor decided to build a Delta hotel on the property. Groundbreaking took place in 2019, with a scheduled opening in 2021. =Opus Las Vegas / unnamed mixed-use project= The Opus Las Vegas was approved in November 2004, and was announced on March 25, 2005, at a conference that was related to high-rise development and was held at the Bellagio resort on the Las Vegas Strip. The $550 million project would have consisted of two 50-story towers with 350 condominium units each, for a total of 700. The project, to be developed by The Congress Group of Boston, was planned for a property that was presently occupied by the city's Scandia Family Fun Center, located west of the Las Vegas Strip at 2900 Sirius Avenue. Up to that point, The Congress Group had spent a year determining construction costs. Scandia and The Congress Group agreed to delay the initial escrow closing date of May 2005, so that final costs for the new project could be completed. As part of the agreement, the Scandia fun center would remain open through the summer, its busiest period, before its scheduled closing date on September 6, 2005. At the time of the announcement, the property was in the process of being sold by Highrise Partners to The Congress Group for an undisclosed amount of money, with escrow expected to close in September 2005. Groundbreaking was expected to occur in the first quarter of 2006, with the first units available for occupancy in spring 2008. Opus Las Vegas would have featured 1,400 parking spaces spread across four levels, along with of residential retail stores. A pool would be located on the property's six-story deck. Floor plans would have ranged from , and would have come in one-, two-, and three-bedroom designs, while the top two floors would be occupied by two-story penthouses. Prices would have ranged from $200,000 to more than $4 million. Developer Michael Jabara said the project would offer \\"a metropolitan lifestyle for people who really want it all, great views, easy access to nearby neighborhood amenities, but at the same time it's an urban project.\\" In June 2005, Scandia said their fun center would remain open as the property had not been sold. On September 7, 2005, Fisher Brothers purchased the property occupied by Scandia, as well as nearby land. In December 2006, Station Casinos and Fisher Brothers announced a joint venture to develop a mixed-use project on up to of land, including the property of the closed Scandia fun center, which was demolished in 2007. As of July 2007, the mixed- use project was to be developed on nearly of land, which had been zoned for several thousand high-rise condominium or hotel units, and would have connected to Station's nearby Palace Station resort. Details about the new project's construction and costs were still undetermined at that time. In 2011, a business named Dig This opened on the vacant property, allowing customers to take control of an excavator on the dirt lot. =Paramount Las Vegas= Paramount Las Vegas was a casino, hotel, and condo resort with more than 1,800 units that was being planned by Royal Palms Las Vegas, a subsidiary of Royal Palms Communities. The project was to replace the Klondike Hotel and Casino at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip, beside the Las Vegas welcome sign. The resort was approved in October 2006, but an investor pulled out of the project in August 2007, and the land was put up for sale in May 2008. =Pinnacle= Pinnacle was to include two 36-story towers, near The Orleans hotel-casino. The project was announced in 2005, and was delayed several times before its cancellation in 2008, as a result of financial issues caused by the Great Recession. =Red Rock project= Announced in July 2005, as a joint venture between Station Casinos and developers Stephen Cloobeck and Steven Molasky. The project was to be built on the same property as the adjacent Red Rock resort, and was known under the names \\"Red Rock Residences\\" and \\"The Residences at Red Rock\\". The partnership dissolved in 2006, and the project was ultimately cancelled. =Rocker Tower= In 1995, Thomas Greenough relocated his bar and restaurant, Tommy Rocker's, to Dean Martin Drive, west of Interstate 15 and the Las Vegas Strip. In 2004, Greenough began receiving numerous offers from condominium developers for the one-acre lot that Tommy Rocker's occupied. Greenough, who was unable to work out a deal with potential developers that would incorporate Tommy Rocker's into any planned condominiums, later chose to build his own condominium on the property. In January 2006, Greenough received approval for a 46-story, 252-unit condominium tower, to be constructed on his property at a cost of $150 million. The structure was to be named Rocker Tower. The tower was expected to be the first in southern Nevada to feature a computerized automated parking structure, with the intention of saving space and decreasing pollution. Greenough had toured Viennese parking garages as part of his research into automated-garage technology. Greenough hoped that the building would be certified by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green Building Rating System. Construction was expected to begin approximately one year later, with completion expected in summer 2008. Later in 2006, construction was scheduled to begin in fall 2007, with completion scheduled for January 2009. By January 2007, Greenough had shelved his plans to build the condominium due to increasing labor and material costs in the Las Vegas Valley. =Sandhurst= The Sandhurst was announced in 2004. The project, to be located in downtown Las Vegas, would have included a 35-story tower with 398 units. The tower would have also included commercial space for shops and restaurants. Groundbreaking was initially planned to begin in March 2005, with completion expected by September 2006. However, construction was delayed several times because of rising construction costs. The project was ultimately cancelled in 2007. =The Harmon Residences= The Harmon hotel, located within CityCenter, initially was to include 207 condominiums. Construction on the building stopped in 2008, after structural defects were discovered. MGM later had the building demolished in 2015. =The Summit / Ivana Las Vegas= Originally announced as The Summit in August 2004, and renamed as Ivana Las Vegas in 2005, when Ivana Trump became involved in the project. Ivana Las Vegas would have consisted of a $500 million, 73-floor tower with 945 condominium units. The tower was to begin construction in summer 2006, at the north end of the Las Vegas Strip, on of land that was occupied by the closed Holy Cow Casino and Brewery at the time. Ivana Las Vegas had been scheduled for completion in December 2008, but was cancelled in December 2005, due to rising construction costs. =Vegas Grand= Vegas Grand was announced by developer Del American in 2003, and initially was to consist of 440 apartments and 440 condominiums. The apartment aspect was removed later that year because of rising construction costs, with all 880 units to be used as condominiums. Construction began east of the Las Vegas Strip in March 2006. Vegas Grand was co-financed by Lehman Brothers, which took over the project in 2007, after Del American defaulted on its loan. The project was ultimately completed as an apartment complex known as Las Vegas Grand. =W Las Vegas= W Las Vegas was announced as a condo hotel in 2005. The project was expanded in 2006, after the purchase of adjacent land that was to be used for Las Ramblas. W Las Vegas was cancelled in 2007, before beginning construction.

It comprises a permanent coastal lagoon of 7800 ha and 1.2 m of average depth, separated from the sea by a restinga or coastal barrier of 28.8 km long and 300–1000 m wide that was formed by the action of the sea current Which runs along the coast in an East-West direction. To the south of the lagoon extends an area dominated by dry forests and to the north, a marine area of 20,700 ha. In total the park covers 39,100 ha. Approximately 4,000 ha of the park are covered by mangrove forests that grow on the banks of the lagoon and even form dense islands towards the center. The lagoon is fed by fresh water mainly from the Guapo river but also from other tributaries such as Pirital, San Nicolás, San Ignacio and Chaguaramal streams. In its northwestern sector the lagoon communicates with the sea through a mouth. In times of severe drought in the Guapo river basin, the decrease in freshwater intake and the accumulation of sediments cause mouth filling, and consequently the increase in the salinity of the lagoon waters. The park comprises three main ecosystems: a shallow brackish lagoon, a dry forest area and a sandy beach barrier or reef.

Biography According to the documentary she was the protagonist of, #ChicagoGirl, Basatneh was born in Damascus, Syria and emigrated to the United States with her family when she was six months old. She lived in Chicago, Illinois, before moving to Miami, Florida. Basatneh graduated from Wright College and Northeastern Illinois University with a political science degree. She is a writer at Fusion focusing mostly on politics and the Arab world. Political activism Basatneh became a political online activist in 2011, after news reports regarding the arrest of 15 young students in Daraa. She organized her first protest in Chicago, demanding the end of the martial law in Syria. Later, using Facebook, she coordinated rallies in Syria, helping anti-regime activists on the ground, as well as distributing the digital footage to various media outlets. She also personally visited Syria to deliver medical supplies. She has met with Hillary Clinton at the United Nations, during Clinton's tenure of the Secretary of State, to discuss international intervention in Syria and possible application of a no-fly zone. Due to her influence and activism, she received a death threat from Syria, which was a reason she was contacted by director Joe Piscatella, who wanted to make a movie about the dark side of social media in revolutions. That project later became a 2013 documentary #ChicagoGirl: The Social Network Takes on a Dictator, which was screened at Seattle International Film Festival in 2014. In 2014, she attended an all-day protest summit RiseUp Summit.

Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003.p. 1502 was an English merchant banker and industrialist. An advocate of closer links between the UK and Germany, he was a prominent voice for co- operation between the countries in the years before the Second World War. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1919. Early years Tennant served in the First World War with the Intelligence Corps, rising to the rank of Captain. A merchant banker by profession, he was highly successful and developed extensive business interests in Germany.Sean Murphy, Letting the Side Down: British Traitors of the Second World War, Sutton Publishing, 2006, p. 3 He was associated with various financial institutions, including the Anglo-Palestine Bank.Brian Garfield, The Meinertzhagen Mystery: The Life and Legend of a Colossal Fraud, Potomac Books, 2007 p. 306 Links to Germany A frequent visitor to Germany, Tennant hoped to encourage greater trade links with the UK. He was initially enthusiastic about Nazism and in 1933 his article \\"Herr Hitler and His Policy: March 1933\\" was published in Douglas Francis Jerrold's The English Review, a journal that was otherwise sceptical about the Nazis despite largely admiring Italian fascism.Richard Griffiths, Fellow Travellers of the Right: British Enthusiasts For Nazi Germany 1933-39, Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 41 He wrote again for the journal in January 1935, claiming in his article \\"Herr Hitler's Constructive Policy\\" that many of the stories of Nazi excesses that appeared in the British press were exaggerations and part of \\"a smoke-screen of anti-Hitler propaganda\\".Griffiths, Fellow Travellers of the Right, pp. 77-78 In order to encourage links, he led a trade delegation to Germany on 9 May 1934. On 20 September 1934, he met Adolf Hitler as part of a further delegation to Germany, along with Robert Vansittart and other industrialists. He also accompanied Paul Rykens and Montagu Norman on trips to Germany and was, along with Lord Rothermere, Esmond Harmsworth and George Ward Price (foreign correspondent of The Daily Mail), one of four guests of honour at a banquet thrown by Hitler on 19 December 1934.Griffiths, Fellow Travellers of the Right, p. 123 During a trip to Germany in 1932, Tennant met Joachim von Ribbentrop and the two men became close friends, with Tennant regularly staying at von Ribbentrop's home in the exclusive Dahlem district of Berlin.Griffiths, Fellow Travellers of the Right, p. 117 Through a friendship with J. C. C. Davidson, Tennant was able to arrange a meeting between von Ribbentrop and Lord President of the Council Stanley Baldwin in November 1934. Accounts of the meeting vary, with Tennant claiming that Baldwin liked von Ribbentrop but Davidson suggesting the opposite. Tennant attempted to use the meeting as a basis for a Baldwin visit to Germany but, after some consideration, he declined the invitation and sent his Parliamentary Private Secretary Geoffrey Lloyd in his stead, a decision that Hitler interpreted as a snub.Griffiths, Fellow Travellers of the Right, p. 118 Tennant was able to arrange another meeting between von Ribbentrop and Baldwin in February 1935 but this was an altogether frostier affair, with Tennant condemning Baldwin roundly for what he considered the future Prime Minister's lack of diplomacy.Griffiths, Fellow Travellers of the Right, pp. 118-119 Anglo- German Fellowship Tennant dined with von Ribbentrop and several British businessmen at the Savoy Hotel on 26 November 1934 at which they decided to organise the pro-German interests on a more formal basis.Garfield, The Meinertzhagen Mystery, p. 181 The plans came to fruition in September 1935 with the establishment of the Anglo-German Fellowship (AGF), an organisation of leading political and business figures in the UK dedicated to the establishment of closer links with Germany. Tennant was appointed the first secretary of the new group.Martin Pugh, Hurrah For the Blackshirts: Fascists and Fascism in Britain Between the Wars, Pimlico, 2006, p. 269 He was also a prominent financier of the AGF and following its formation he was recognised as the main driving force behind the group, which for a time enjoyed widespread influence in the higher echelons of British society.Murphy, Letting the Side Down, p. 4 He was for a time close to Richard Meinertzhagen, having met him through his father and brother, both of whom were merchant banking colleagues of Tennant. Meinertzhagen was also a founder member of the AGF.Garfield, The Meinertzhagen Mystery, p. 305 Tennant was one of a group of prominent Britons who attended the Nuremberg rally in 1935. Unity Mitford, a virulent supporter of the Nazi movement, was also among those who travelled there.Pugh, Hurrah For the Blackshirts, Pimlico, 2006, p. 271 Tennant was not, however, a convinced Nazi and as early as 1935 had acknowledged that Nazi antisemitism was a source of embarrassment to those in the UK advocating closer links to Germany. He added that he intended not to listen to any specifically anti-Jewish speeches delivered at the rallies.Pugh, Hurrah For the Blackshirts, p. 272 Tennant also helped to facilitate David Lloyd George's visit to Germany the same year, with the former Prime Minister subsequently writing a favourable tribute to Hitler after the visit.Griffiths, Fellow Travellers of the Right, p. 222 Towards war Tennant initially accepted the German justification for their activities in central Europe - that they were merely safeguarding German minority populations - and wrote to The Times in defence of the march into the Rhineland in 1936.Griffiths, Fellow Travellers of the Right, pp. 191-192 He was still keen to stress however that he was not a Nazi, and rejected membership of the Link when it was established in 1937, reasoning that the group was too pro-Nazi.Griffiths, Fellow Travellers of the Right, p. 277 Having grown very close to the historian Philip Conwell-Evans - himself a leading AGF member - the two men became increasingly uneasy about Nazi Germany, particularly following the Anschluss.Griffiths, Fellow Travellers of the Right, p. 301 By 1938, he had grown disillusioned with Hitler and privately began to characterise German actions as simply expansionism.Murphy, Letting the Side Down, p. 13 Tennant was one of a number of leading pro-German Britons sent to Germany clandestinely with the approval of the British government in 1939 in an attempt to avoid war by conversing with Nazis considered sympathetic to the UK.Pugh, Hurrah For the Blackshirts, p. 282 To this end he met von Ribbentrop at his castle near Salzburg in July, with the Nazi ambassador telling Tennant that he considered the UK's Polish guarantee as a provocative gesture to Germany.Pugh, Hurrah For the Blackshirts, p. 283 At the meeting (which had the unofficial approval of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain) von Ribbentrop told Tennant that if the British wanted war with the Nazis then \\"Germany is ready\\". Following the war Tennant was subpoenaed to the Nuremberg trials to testify about von Ribbentrop. Personal life Tennant was the son of William Augustus Tennant and Agnes Gairdner and lived at Orford House, a country house that was already in his family. He was a cousin of Margot Asquith.Griffiths, Fellow Travellers of the Right, p. 182 He married Eleonora Fiaschi on 11 April 1912 and the couple had four children together before divorcing. On 15 February 1950 he remarried, this time to Irene Adelaide Gage, the daughter of Henry Gage, 5th Viscount Gage.

Grave plate of Magnus of Saxe-Lauenburg  Family  The father of Magnus was Duke Eric IV of Saxe-Lauenburg; his mother was Sophia, a daughter of Duke Magnus II of Brunswick. His brothers were Duke Eric V of Saxe-Lauenburg and Duke Bernard II of Saxe-Lauenburg.  Bishop in Cammin  He entered priestly service and was a canon in Cammin. Under a dispensation from having to attain the required canonical age, Magnus was appointed Bishop of Cammin in 1410 by Pope Alexander V. This appointment was a result of the Western Schism, because there was also a Bishop Nicholas in the Bishopric, a supporter of Gregory XII. Even though the latter died after a short period, Magnus' post was not undisputed. In 1415, Gregory XII assigned the Bishopric to the Bishop of Schleswig, John of Gudensberg. With the general recognition of Martin V as pope in 1418, Magnus was also accepted as the sole Bishop of Cammin. A short time afterwards he was officially ordained bishop. In the years that followed he concentrated on preserving the independence of the territory of the bishopric, the Stift. In 1417, he was enfeoffed with Cammin by King Sigismund; this came with its recognition as an Imperial Estate. In 1422, this found expression in its entry in the Reichsmatrikel. Magnus also tried to regain the estates of the Stift enfeoffed by his predecessors. Despite that, the position of the bishop was not recognised by Bogislav IX and other magnates, and the disputes continued.  Bishop of Hildesheim  In 1424, Magnus moved to the seat of the Bishop of Hildesheim. Previously, he had been appointed as coadjutor by Bishop John III. During his reign, the monastery's debts had risen sharply. He had also faced external threats. Magnus arrived in Hildesheim in 1425 and called for an extended electoral capitulation. He tried to strengthen his position as the territorial lord in the Bishopric of Hildesheim, securing and expanding its area. Internally, he was keen to end disorder and bring peace. To that end, he entered into alliances with neighbouring territories and cities. He tried to establish a good relationship with the city of Hildesheim. This was successful overall. But at times, however, there were conflicts between the city's aspirations for independence and his attempt to expand his territorial lordship. Magnus also tried to redeem the Bishopric's fiefs. However, this was only possible for Steuerwald Castle. The need for money led to the levying of taxes (Bede). This required the approval of the Landstände. In doing so, they expanded their influence. In addition, castles, districts Ämter, income and other legal rights had to be pledged. In return, parts of the lordships of Everstein and Homburg were acquired. Thus the Bishopric of Hildesheim reached its greatest extent. In the ecclesial life of the Bishopric, Magnus introduced a number of indulgences. The festival of the Presentation of Mary was introduced for the first time. He also supported monastic reform efforts. Where necessary, he also used his power as a territorial lord for this purpose. He supported Nicholas of Cusa. In 1452, Magnus appointed Bernard of Brunswick-Lüneburg as coadjutor and resigned shortly afterwards. In the same year he died and was buried in Hildesheim Cathedral.

Unlike Mega-Merger it has a trivial termination and cost analysis.  Introduction  Yo-yo was introduced by Nicola Santoro. It proceeds by consecutive elimination and a graph-reduction technique called pruning. The algorithm is divided in a pre-processing phase followed by a cyclic repetition of a forward phase, called \\"Yo-\\" and a backward one, called \\"-Yo\\".  Pre-requisites  Yo-Yo builds elects a minimum leader under the following premises: * Total reliability: No message is lost in transmission. * Initial Distinct Values (ID): Each node has a unique identifier. * Bi-directional communications channels: Each edge is bi- directional, communications can travel in both directions. No further restrictions are necessary.  Algorithm  = Preprocessing = The preprocessing phase is started with a broadcast. At awake state, each node sends its id to all of its neighbors and orients the edge towards the higher- degree node. Note as this is just a logical step, the bi-directional channel is not lost in the procedure. By convergecast the initiator is notified of the preprocessing termination. This process creates three categories of nodes: * Sources: nodes with outgoing nodes, but no incoming nodes. These are the least nodes in each neighborhood. * Intermediate nodes: nodes with both outgoing and incoming edges. These are neither the least nor the greatest nodes in each neighborhood. * Sinks: nodes with incoming edges, but no outgoing edges. These are the greatest nodes in each neighborhood. = Yo- = 201x201px The \\"Yo-\\" phase is initiated by the sources. A source sends its id through its incoming edges, and waits. The intermediate nodes wait to receive the respective ids from each of their incoming edges. Once all of expected values are collected, a minimum computation is performed and the minimum id is forwarded through the outgoing edges. Sinks are passive in this phase. The messages are sent through the oriented edges and reach the sinks, which trigger the \\"-Yo\\" phase. = -Yo = The -Yo phase pulls up positive/negative answers. Sinks initiate the \\"-Yo\\" phase by computing the minimum id received and sending a positive YES or negative NO through their incoming edges. A YES is sent through the edges carrying the minimum computed id, a NO through the remaining edges. The messages walk up the structure to the sources: the sources with at least one incoming NO become dead and lose their candidate status. The \\"-Yo\\" phase also comprises a re-structuring phase where the sources-intermediates-sinks is accommodated for the non-candidate sources. The edges carrying a NO are reversed and the losers candidates of the current stage become either sinks or intermediate nodes. = Pruning = Pruning is an optimization technique applied in the \\"-Yo\\" phase, and its message is usually incorporated with the positive/negative response. It deletes useless edges and nodes. The former are edges that receive the same value from u > 1 incoming edges: trivially u are useless and trimmed by the node. Such edges become dead and are ignored in the following iterations. The latter instead reduces the number of nodes by deleting unary sinks, that is sinks with v = 1 incoming edge. These edges will be forced to send back the (only) received minimum with a YES reply, hence they do not perform any computation useful to the minimum finding. Structure before and after pruning. First the top right-most node becomes a sink from receiving a NO. Being a sink with only one incoming edge, it is trimmed. Same goes for its parent and the central branch.  Cost  The pre-processing phase is composed of an exchange through each edge of the two nodes incident on the edge. Thus we have a cost of sum_{v in V} deg(v) = 2m. The Yo-Yo phases consist of a forward and backward scan of the structure, hence 2m_i messages, where m_i is the number of current active edges. The number of iterations is given by the number of iterations useful in order to delete each initial source. By hypothesis, each source is linked to at least another one by an intermediate node: if this was not the case then a disconnected component of the graph, but by definition the graph is connected. In the worst-case scenario intermediate n_i nodes are connected in pairs and at each iteration at most half of the sources are eliminated. By restructuring each of the surviving n_{i+1} sources will now be connected in pairs. As in the previous case, at most half will survive. Clearly the termination is met when only one source remains. The halving imposes a log_2 n number of iterations over the latest computation, i.e. the one between the two farthest away surviving sources, placed at diam(G). The total cost amounts to 2m log{n}.  Termination  Termination is guaranteed by the switch in directions performed in the YES/NO pull. The sources reduction in the \\"-Yo\\" phase is monotonic: by the previous observation each source is compared to at least one other source, and by uniqueness of the sources, one of them prevails while the others become dead. Since the number of initial sources is finite, the monotonic reduction will lead to a single source remaining.

It is part of the Amazon biome. The ecoregion covers a stretch of flat and relatively infertile land between the Purus and Madeira rivers, extending to the Solimões River (upper Amazon) in the north. It is isolated from other regions by the seasonally flooded várzea forest along these rivers, and has a high degree of endemism among its flora and fauna. The natural environment is relatively intact. The BR-319 highway was built along the length of the ecoregion in the early 1970s, but rapidly deteriorated and is now closed. Location The Purus-Madeira moist forests ecoregion lies to the east of the Carauari arch, an ancient uplift zone in Brazil. The ecoregion stretches from southwest to northeast between the Purus River to the west and the Madeira River to the east, both tributaries of the Solimões River (upper Amazon). In the south it is crossed by the Igapó-Açu River, Ipixuna River, Itaparaná River, Mucuim River, and Jari River. The large rivers that separate the ecoregion from surrounding regions prevent many species from migrating from or to other regions, making a distinctive environment with various endemic species. The Purus-Madeira moist forests are bounded by the Purus várzea ecoregion along the Purus and the Monte Alegre várzea along the Solimões and Madeira. The Madeira-Tapajós moist forests lie on the east shore of the Madeira. To the south there are stretches of Iquitos várzea in the Southwest Amazon moist forests. Physical The ecoregion covers an almost entirely flat area of in the lower Amazon basin. The plain holds large meandering rivers that have formed many oxbow lakes, and a great many small streams, all subject to annual flooding. Elevations range from . It is within the low Amazon Basin, an area of soft sediments that emerged from five to two million years ago. Soils are acidic and low in nutrients, mostly sandy podzols or hydromorphic clay soils. Ecology The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. =Climate= The Köppen climate classification is \\"Am\\": equatorial, monsoonal. Average temperatures range from with a mean of . Temperatures are fairly constant throughout the year. Average annual precipitation is . Precipitation is lowest in July with an average of and highest in March with an average of . =Flora= Most of the vegetation is seasonally flooded tropical lowland rainforest. The flora have high biodiversity and endemism. In the north the forest is dense with a canopy of and emergent trees of up to . There is a dense understory. In the south the canopy is more open and the understory less dense. In the extreme south the moist forest meets patches of wooded savanna. As with other forests of the Amazon basin the main families are Fabaceae, Sapotaceae, Lecythidaceae, Moraceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lauraceae and Myristicaceae. The most common species are Eschweilera alba, Eschweilera odora, Pouteria guianensis, Vantanea guianensis, Ragala sanguinolenta, Licania apetala and Iryanthera ulei. Four common species of palm are Astrocaryum vulgare, Oenocarpus bataua, Attalea maripa, and Socratea exorrhiza. The palm- like Spathelia excelsa fruits once and then dies. Couma utilis provides edible fruit. The Physocalymma scaberrim is a typical emergent with red hardwood timber used in furniture. =Fauna= The bare-eared squirrel monkey (Saimiri ustus) is endemic. There is diverse fauna with many endemic species. 165 species of mammals have been recorded, of which over 80 are bats. Primates include the bare-eared squirrel monkey (Saimiri ustus), white-fronted capuchin (Cebus albifrons), brown woolly monkey (Lagothrix lagotricha), and five species of titi monkey (Callicebus genus), of which Hershkovitz's titi (Callicebus dubius), ashy black titi (Callicebus cinerascens), and collared titi (Callicebus torquatus) are endemic. Other mammals include Hoffmann's two- toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni), brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus), silky anteater (Cyclopes didactylus), southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), red brocket (Mazama americana), gray brocket (Mazama gouazoubira), and South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris). Endangered mammals include Peruvian spider monkey (Ateles chamek), white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). Green iguana (Iguana iguana) and tegus lizards (genus Tupinambis) are common. Snakes include fer-de-lance (Bothrops asper), palm pit-vipers (genus Bothriechis), coral snakes (genus Micrurus), bushmasters (Lachesis muta) and boa constrictors (Boa constrictor). 572 species of birds have been recorded including migrant toucan (genus Ramphastos), Amazon parrot (genus Amazona), and macaw (genus Ara). Resident birds included tanagers (genera Tangara and Tachyphonus), woodcreepers (genus Xiphorhynchus), resplendent quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno), 15 species of curassows (genera Crax, Nothocrax, Mitu and Pauxi), and tinamous (genera Crypturellus and Tinamus). Endangered birds include wattled curassow (Crax globulosa), green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster) and red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus). =Status= The World Wildlife Fund classes the ecoregion as \\"Relatively Stable/Intact\\". Most of the environment is undamaged, apart from the south. A paved road (BR-319) was built along the length of the region from Humaitá to Manaus, but it proved impossible to maintain and was closed. The Trans-Amazonian Highway crosses the southwestern end of the region from Humaitá to Lábrea and has caused deforestation to create pasturage and agricultural fields. The southern area is threatened by controlled and uncontrolled fires. Mining in the upper sections of the Purus and Madeira rivers causes pollution and habitat destruction. During the period from 2004 to 2011 the ecoregion experienced an annual rate of habitat loss of 0.32%. Global warming will force tropical species to migrate uphill to find areas with suitable temperature and rainfall. Low, flat ecoregions such as the Purus-Madeira moist forests are extremely vulnerable.

Biography Clarke was born in Harrow in Middlesex. Her father, Joseph Thacher Clarke was an American architect. Clarke won a scholarship that allowed her to attend the Slade School of Fine Art. Aged fifteen, Clarke initially studied at the Slade on a part-time basis for three days each week throughout 1910 and 1911 but during 1915 and 1916 she studied sculpture there as a full-time student. Clarke first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1923 and continued to do so until 1959. In the early 1930s she was a regular exhibitor in group shows at the Goupil Gallery and in March 1937 had her first solo show at the French Gallery. She also exhibited at the Paris Salon and with the Royal Society of British Artists. Clarke's works included bronze castings, memorials and wood sculptures, often of African heads. For example she was commissioned to sculpt the posthumous portrait bust of Sir Walter Morley Fletcher. The most notable of her memorials is the panel and medallion tribute to Joseph Conrad at Bishopsbourne in Kent, which was unveiled in 1927. Clarke also wrote about, and promoted African art and spent a year, between 1927 and 1928 in Kenya, where she made many drawings which when she returned to London she used as the basis for wood carvings and bronzes of tribal figures. Wood carving became her technique of choice, often working with hardwoods and, on occasion, sperm whale teeth. Clarke married Admiral Gervase B Middleton in 1938 but rarely exhibited work under her married name. During World War II, Clarke was commissioned by the War Artists' Advisory Committee to produce a portrait medallion depicting a serviceman who had been awarded the George Cross. This proved to be the only portrait medallion acquired for the WAAC collection. Sculptures by Clarke are held in various museums, including the Ashmolean Museum which also holds a 1936 portrait of her by Orovida Camille Pissarro.

Dishwasher detergent is different from dishwashing liquid made to wash dishes by hand. Uses When using a dishwasher, the user must select a special detergent for its use. All detergents are designed for use after the user scrapes leftover food from the dishes before washing. To function, the user places dishes in the dishwasher in such fashion that the surface of all dishes is open to the flow of water. Most dishwasher detergents are incompatible for use with silver, brass, cast iron, bronze, aluminum, pewter, and goldleaf. They can also harm disposable plastic, anything wood, knives with hollow handles, and fine glassware. Types The best dishwasher detergents would be those that clean dishes the best, leave the least cleaner after rinsing, have versatility in cleaning various types of dish surfaces and food, are easiest to use, and the best value for price. There is variation in how effective different detergents are in removing dried food from glass and baked-on sticky food from pots. In the course of washing, a better detergent will both prevent washed-away food from redepositing on the dishes, and also prevent mineral accumulation or discoloration of the dishes. Composition Different kinds of dishwashing detergent contain different combinations of ingredients. Common ingredients include: * Phosphates ** Bind calcium and magnesium ions to prevent 'hard- water' type limescale deposits. They can cause ecological damage, so their use is starting to be phased out. Phosphate-free detergents are sold as eco- friendly detergents. * Oxygen-based bleaching agents (older-style powders and liquids contain chlorine-based bleaching agents) ** Break up and bleach organic deposits. * Non-ionic surfactants ** Lower the surface tension of the water, emulsifies oil, lipid and fat food deposits, prevents droplet spotting on drying. * Alkaline salts ** These are a primary component in older and original-style dishwasher detergent powders. Highly alkaline salts attack and dissolve grease, but are extremely corrosive (fatal) if swallowed. Salts used may include metasilicates, alkali metal hydroxides, sodium carbonate etc. * Enzymes ** Break up protein-based food deposits, and possibly oil, lipid and fat deposits. Proteases do this by breaking down the proteins into smaller peptides that are more easily washed away. * Anti-corrosion agent(s) ** Often sodium silicate, this prevents corrosion of dishwasher components. Dishwashing detergent may also contain: * Anti-foaming agents ** Foam interferes with the washing action. Foam may affect operation of the machine's water-level sensors and will leak past the door seals. * Additives to slow down the removal of glaze & patterns from glazed ceramics * Perfumes * Anti-caking agents (in granular detergent) * Starches (in tablet based detergents) * Gelling agents (in liquid/gel based detergents) * Sand (inexpensive powdered detergents) Dishwasher detergents are strongly alkaline (basic). Inexpensive powders may contain sand. Such detergents may harm the dishes and the dishwasher. Powdered detergents are more likely to cause fading on china patterns. Besides older style detergents for dishwashers, biodegradable detergents also exist for dishwashers. These detergents may be more environmentally friendly than conventional detergents. Hand-washing dish detergent (washing up liquid) creates a large foam of bubbles which will leak from the dishwasher. =Rinse aid= Rinse aid (sometimes called rinse agent) contains surfactants and uses Marangoni stress to prevent droplet formation, so that water drains from the surfaces in thin sheets, rather than forming droplets. The benefits of using it are that it prevents \\"spotting\\" on glassware (caused by droplets of water drying and leaving behind dissolved limescale minerals), and can also improve drying performance as there is less water remaining to be dried. A thinner sheet of water also has a much larger surface-area than a droplet of the same volume, which increases the likelihood of water molecules evaporating.

Assimilation of Jews in Venezuela was difficult, though small communities could be found in Puerto Cabello, Villa de Cura, Carupano, Rio Chico, Maracaibo, and Barquisimeto. =20th century= During World War II, the Venezuelan government broke relations with the Axis powers in 1942, with many groups consisting of hundreds of German-Venezuelans leaving Venezuela to be repatriated into Nazi Germany. In the early 1980s, Venezuela had invested much into the country's infrastructure and communications, though by the mid-1980s when Venezuela faced economic difficulties and inequality increased, some Venezuelans emigrated. Again, at the peak of Venezuela's socioeconomic difficulties in the late 1990s, Venezuelans began to emigrate once more, with some attempting to enter the United States legally and illegally. =21st century= Bolivarian diaspora Following the Bolivarian Revolution, many Venezuelans have sought residence in other countries.

El Universal explains how the \\"Bolivarian diaspora\\" in Venezuela has been caused by the \\"deterioration of both the economy and the social fabric, rampant crime, uncertainty and lack of hope for a change in leadership in the near future\\". In 1998, the year Chavez was first elected, only 14 Venezuelans were granted U.S. asylum. In just 12 months in September 1999, 1,086 Venezuelans were granted asylum according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. It has been calculated that from 1998 to 2013, over 1.5 million Venezuelans, between 4% and 6% of the Venezuela's total population, left the country following the Bolivarian Revolution. Many former Venezuelan citizens studied gave reasons for leaving Venezuela that included lack of freedom, high levels of insecurity and inadequate opportunity in the country. It has also been stated that some parents in Venezuela encourage their children to leave the country for their own protection because of the insecurities Venezuelans face.

Its site has since been taken over by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, and is home to the Mountain Home National Cemetery and the James H. Quillen VA Center. Also known as the Mountain Home, its campus was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 2011, as a well-preserved example of an early 20th-century veterans care facility. Description and history The National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers (NHDVS) was created by the United States federal government in the waning days of the American Civil War, as a means to provide needed support for Union Army veterans of the war. Between 1865 and 1930 a total of eleven branches of this service were founded. The Mountain Branch was established in 1901 by the NHDVS through the efforts of Congressman Walter P. Brownlow. Land for the campus was purchased soon after the enabling legislation was signed, and major development took place between then and 1903, when the unfinished facility opened its doors. The campus was designed by New York City architect Joseph H. Freelander, a proponent of the Beaux Arts style of architecture, and landscape designer Carl Andersen. The many surviving buildings that make up the core of the present VA campus are in the Beaux Arts style. The complex received notice in architectural publications, including criticism that it was overly exotic for its comparatively rural location. The NHDVS was absorbed in the Veterans Administration (now the United State Department of Veterans Affairs) in 1930, at which time another round of construction took place. A third major round of building occurred in the 1970s and 1980s, after the VA developed a master plan for the site. The Mountain Home National Cemetery was established in 1903, in a manner similar to other national cemeteries located adjacent to NHDVS facilities. Most of the surviving campus continues to be used by the Department of Veterans of Affairs as the James H. Quillen VA Center.
