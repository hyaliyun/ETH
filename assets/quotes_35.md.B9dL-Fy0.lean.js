Gyeney described the film as a cross between Die Hard, Gamer, and The Firm. The film stars Larenz Tate, Manu Bennett, Linden Ashby, and Yuji Okumoto. The film was released on July 22, 2016. Plot While testing the latest first person shooter from global game developer, Sentinel, video game champion Max Troy discovers the events happening within the game are being reflected in the real world. He soon determines that the game's protagonist is real-life Orson Creed, an ex-Sentinel employee who is being remotely controlled by the corporation for reasons unknown. As virtual and real worlds collide, Max and Creed must join forces to unravel the conspiracy before the game's sinister events escalate and overwhelm the city.

Gyeney provided information on the film stating \\"this film has 127 scenes and with [my] Type-A personality, I have a very specific vision.\\" Casting Gyeney stated, \\"I'm not Steven Spielberg,\\" while indicating that there would be no auditions or screen tests for the film. Scripts were sent out to actors whom Gyeney was familiar with, and those of whom liked the script with interest of being in the film were cast. Larenz Tate was cast as the protagonist, Max. Manu Bennett as the hero video game character, Orson Creed. And, Linden Ashby as Kincaid, the primary villain of the film. Filming Principal photography was conducted in Seattle, Washington. It took place over 19 days starting November 7. 2014 and finishing on November 26, 2014. Seattle was chosen as the place to shoot the film because it is Gyeney's hometown and he believed \\"shooting such a movie in the Northwest will diversify the local film community, which is mostly dominated by indie dramas. It could lead to an entire wave of action-oriented material being shot here, which would bring tons of work to local stunt teams and stuff that is totally nonexistent right now.\\" Gyeney stated, \\"the longest long-take fight sequence currently on record is three-and-a-half minutes, and it's held by the Korean movie 'Oldboy.' Our goal is to destroy that record.\\" Animation Video game footage was needed to be developed for the film after principal photography was completed. It began in December 2014 starting with the character, Creed. Release The film was released on July 22, 2016. In their review for The Hollywood Reporter, Frank Scheck praised the film for being \\"impressively choreographed and filmed\\", though criticized the film for choosing technology over realism, as well as exploiting real life tragedies such as 9/11. He also criticized the \\"outdated visual style\\" of the graphics, which would be noticed by hardcore gamers, whom this film is targeted towards.

There are many prominent people in Syria who are of Lebanese descent. Background On 1 September 1920, France reestablished Greater Lebanon after the Moutasarrifiya rule removed several regions belonging to the Principality of Lebanon and gave them to Syria. The exact population of Lebanese people in Syria is quite difficult to define. In terms of social consequences, the division of Bilad al-Sham presented many dilemmas for its inhabitants. For example, up until 1950, many Lebanese who were born before 1920 considered themselves Syrians; that is why a Lebanese‚Äîand a Christian‚ÄîFares al-Khoury, was able to assume the position of Prime Minister of Syria in the 1940s.The Origins of Syrian Nationhood: Histories, Pioneers and Identity Many who were considered Lebanese by the French mandate worked as Syrian educators, businessmen, traders, etc. and did not distinguish themselves from the Syrians as such. As to border lines, they were fictitious in the eyes of the population, especially for those who were living on one side or the other of the border. Hence, an extended family, tribe or clan, found itself divided by such lines, placing one part of the family within Syrian territory, and the other part within Lebanon. In addition, there are several towns and villages inhabited by a community of some 15,000 Lebanese Shiites who have lived for decades on the Syrian side of a frontier that is not clearly demarcated in places and not fully controlled by border authorities. They are mostly Lebanese citizens, though some have dual citizenship or are only Syrian citizens. Religious affiliations The Lebanese people of Syria are predominantly Lebanese Shia Twelver Muslim and Lebanese Christian (Greek Orthodox, Melkite, Maronite, Protestant) with a tiny minority that belongs to Sunni Islam in Lebanon. More specifically, most Lebanese people within the territory of Syria belong to either Twelver Shia Islam, Maronite or Greek Orthodox Christianity. The Lebanese Twelvers/Imamis in Syria, numbering about 750,000 or 3% of the population of Syria. In Damascus there are Lebanese Twelvers/Imamis living near to the Shia pilgrimage sites, especially in the al-Amara-quarter which is near to Umayyad Mosque and Sayyidah Ruqayya Mosque, and around Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque. Another important site is Bab Saghir Cemetery. The Shia Twelvers in Syria have close links to the Lebanese Shi'a Twelvers.Report: Hizbullah Training Shiite Syrians to Defend Villages against Rebels Twelver Shias are also found in villages in Idlib, Homs and Aleppo provinces. More specifically, the Lebanese Shiite enclave on the Syrian side of the border is near the central city of Homs and across from Hermel, a predominantly Shiite region of northeastern Lebanon. As a result of the Syrian Civil War many Lebanese people from Syria, mainly dual citizens of Lebanon and Syria, returned and continue to return to Lebanon.THE SITUATION & NEEDS OF LEBANESE RETURNEES FROM SYRIA Many of these are dual citizens from the so-called ‚ÄúLebanese villages‚Äù, predominantly Shiite villages just inside Syria, where the villagers are said to hold Lebanese citizenship. Also, Lebanese Shias try to defend the Lebanese Shias' area around the holy Shiite shrine of Sayida Zeinab, named for the granddaughter of Islam's Prophet Muhammad's, south of Damascus. Unfortunately, the conflict around these border areas with Lebanese minority populations is used to increase the Syrian Civil War spillover in Lebanon.

Reijtenbagh and Credit Suisse Strategic Partners settled the matter two months later in May 2009. In April 2009, JPMorgan Chase sued Reijtenbagh alleging Reijtenbagh defaulted on his obligations under a credit agreement as a result of the lawsuit filed by Credit Suisse Strategic Partners. The litigation was based on a material adverse change (MAC) in circumstances. Reijtenbagh reached a settlement with JP Morgan Chase in September 2009.Michael West, Dutchman set for record profit from a legal action, The Sydney Morning Herald, 5 November 2012. In October 2018, the Court of Antwerp approved a settlement between Reijtenbagh and the Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office of Antwerp (Belgium). The settlement is a legislated arrangement that provides a final and complete resolution of the dispute that concerned domicile-related tax and ancillary issues which allegedly occurred over a decade ago. The settlement did not constitute any conviction, nor any finding or admission of guilt, wrongdoing or misconduct whatsoever. Under the approved settlement, the Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office has discontinued the entire prosecution and dismissed all charges with prejudice. Accordingly, Reijtenbagh has been cleared of all charges and allegations.

Painter Run is slightly acidic, with pH values ranging from 5.99 to 6.88. The stream is in a narrow valley with several ridges nearby. Sandstone of the Pocono Formation occurs near it. At least two bridges have been constructed over the stream. Its unnamed tributary is considered to be Class A Wild Trout Waters. Course Painter Run above Oxhorn Run Painter Run begins in a small pond in a shallow valley in Davidson Township. It flows southeast for a few tenths of a mile and receives an unnamed tributary from the right. It then turns east for several tenths of a mile and its valley becomes deeper and narrower. The stream gradually turns south and receives an unnamed tributary from the left. After several tenths of a miles, it receives another unnamed tributary from the right. The stream then turns southeast for some distance and its valley continues to become deeper. It then receives another unnamed tributary from the left and turns southeast for approximately a mile, flowing alongside State Route 2003. It then gradually turns south-southeast and receives its only named tributary, Oxhorn Run, from the right.

It attains the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's standards. However, its tributary Oxhorn Run does not meet the standards and is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Painter Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. Painter Run is in a narrow valley between two mountains. There is also a ridge to the north of the stream. Another ridge lies between the stream and West Branch Fishing Creek. Sandstone of the Pocono Formation occurs near the headwaters of Painter Run. In most of the stream's valley, alluvium, alluvial terrace, alluvial fan, and a glacial till known as the Wisconsinan Till can be found. The Wisconsinan Bouldery Till occurs on the eastern side of the stream's valley in its lower reaches. Bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale can also be found in the vicinity of the stream. During the Wisconsinan Glaciation, tongues of ice flowed northwest up Painter Run. Watershed The watershed of Painter Run has an area of . The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Elk Grove. An unnamed tributary of Painter Run is considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters from its source to its mouth. The headwaters of Painter Run are in a pond. History Painter Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1183207. In 1864, it was alleged that an organization known as the Fishing Creek Confederacy constructed a fort in the upper reaches of the Fishing Creek watershed. The supposed remains of the fort are in the vicinity of Painter Run. Approximately a thousand soldiers searched the watersheds of East Branch Fishing Creek and West Branch Fishing Creek for deserters and any sign of a fort. However, they were unable to find any evidence of a fort and returned to Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge was constructed over Painter Run in 1930. It is long and carries State Route 2003. Another bridge of the same type was built over the stream west of Elk Grove in 1957. This bridge is long and carries State Route 2003. The latter bridge was listed as structurally deficient by 2012. In June 2012, there were plans to repair it in early July 2012.

Countries by Climate change performance Index The climate movement is the collective of nongovernmental organizations engaged in activism related to the issues of climate change. It is a subset of the broader environmental movement, but some regard it as a new social movement itself given its scope, strength, and activities. History The climate movement has rapidly evolved in the first decades of the 21st century, starting as one of the many causes of the environmental movement. Activism related to climate change began in the 1990s, when major environmental organizations became involved in the discussions about climate, mainly in the UNFCCC framework. In the 2000s several climate-specific organizations were founded, such as 350.org, Energy Action Coalition, and the Global Call for Climate Action. Mobilization for Copenhagen 2009 The 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen was the first UNFCCC summit in which the climate movement started showing its mobilization power at a large scale. Between 40,000 and 100,000 people attended a march in Copenhagen on December 12 calling for a global agreement on climate. And activism went beyond Copenhagen, with more than 5,400 rallies and demonstrations took place around the world simultaneously.  Activities  2014 People‚Äôs Climate March The People's Climate March 2014, brought together hundreds of thousands of people for strong action on climate change. The climate movement convened its largest single event on 21 September 2014, when it mobilized 400,000 activists in New York during the People‚Äôs Climate March (plus several thousand more in other cities), organized by the People's Climate Movement, to demand climate action from the global leaders gathered for the 2014 UN Climate Summit. Fossil Fuel Divestment The Fossil Fuel Divestment movement calls for colleges and universities, as well as cities, states, religious institutions, and pension funds to withdraw their investments from fossil fuel companies. 350.org launched its Go Fossil Free campaign in 2012 with Bill McKibben's \\"Do The Math\\" speaking tour around the country. 350.org explains that the reasoning behind this campaign is simple: \\"If it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from that wreckage.\\" The Fossil Fuel Divestment movement escalated tactics in the spring of 2015, with 19 students arrested at Yale University, a week-long blockade of Harvard University's administrative buildings, a 70-student sit-in at Tulane University, and other arrestable actions.McDonald, Michael. \\"Yale Students Cited at Fuel-Divestment Protest.\\" Bloomberg.com.

NOLA Media Group, 14 Apr. 2015. Web. 15 Apr. 2015. Climate Mobilization Since 2014, growing portions of the climate movement, especially in the United States have been organizing for an international economic response to climate change on the scale of the mobilization of the American home front during World War II, with the goal of rapidly slashing carbon emissions and transitioning to 100% clean energy faster than the free market is likely to allow. Throughout 2015 and 2016, The Climate Mobilization led grassroots campaigns in the U.S. for this scale of ambition, and in July 2016, activists succeeded in getting text adopted into the Democratic Party's national platform calling for WWII-scale climate mobilization. In August 2015, environmentalist Bill McKibben published an article in the New Republic rallying Americans to \\"declare war on climate change.\\"A school strike for climate in Berlin (2018).  School strikes for climate  Since August 2018, inspired by Greta Thunberg, children and students in at least 270 cities took part in school strikes for the climate.  Youth Climate Strikes  Organized by Isra Hirsi, Haven Coleman, and Alexandria Villase√±or, the Youth Climate Strikes US, encourages youth in the United States to protest on behalf of the environment. Paralleling the work done by Greta Thunberg, this organization encourages students to join the school strikes for climate, both in the US and globally. Isra Hirsi is the daughter of Ilhan Omar, a US representative from Minnesota, and an advocate for the strikes. Isra pushes the climate strikes to become more diverse, stating \\"Those that are disproportionally affected by climate change should be at the forefront of the issue, advocating for ourselves and our communities\\" and \\"A diverse group of organizers doesn't mean a diverse group of participants.\\" The Youth Climate Strike on March 15, 2019, included students from 47 countries and over almost all 50 States participating in the movement.  Global Climate Strike  Between 20 and 27 September, 2019 was the Global Climate Strike. This appeal mobilized a record 7.6 million people take to the streets and strike for climate action. The biggest climate mobilisation in history. The strike was followed in more than 185 countries. In some of these countries, the call exceeded the student character and was called at the labor level by some unions as happened in Italy. Roles of other movements The climate movement is closely connected to other parts of the environmental movement, in particular groups aiming for a sustainable society and sustainable energy. Also, the faith community has been active in the climate movement, both at an interfaith level (such as in Our Voices) and at the specific level of each denomination (such as the Global Catholic Climate Movement). With this movement, new youth international organizations have emerged to join the climate change movement such as Fridays for Future or Extinction Rebellion.  Methods  These are several approaches that have been used in the past by climate advocates and advocacy campaigns: * the provision of information, * framing of information about aspects of global climate change, and * challenging the terms of political debates. All three of these methods have been implemented in climate campaigns aimed at the general public. The information about the impacts of global climate change plays a role in forming climatic beliefs, attitudes, and behavior, while the effects of other approaches (e.g. provision of information about solutions to GCC, consensus framing, use of mechanistic information) is yet mostly unknown. The third approach is to create space for discussions that move beyond questions of economic interests that often dominate political debates to emphasize ecological values and grass-roots democracy. This has been argued to be crucial to bringing about more significant structural change. Targeting of activists The United States government through its domestic intelligence services targeted, as \\"domestic terrorists,\\" environmental activists and climate change organizations, including by investigating them, questioning them, and placing them on national \\"watchlists\\" that makes it more difficult for them to board airplanes and that could instigate local law enforcement monitoring.The Guardian, 24 Sept. 2019, \\"Revealed: How the FBI Targeted Environmental Activists in Domestic Terror Investigations: Protesters Were Characterized as a Threat to National Security in What One Calls an Attempt to Criminalize their Actions\\" Unknown actors also secretly hired professional hackers to launch phishing hacking attacks against climate activists who were organizing the #ExxonKnew campaign.The Guardian, 11 June 2020, \\"Hack-for-Hire Group Targeted Climate Activists behind #ExxonKnew Campaign\\" See also * Business action on climate change * Environmental movement * Ecological movement * Environmental racism * List of environmental protests References Category:Green politics Movement ","title":"Climate movement"},{"id":"44895975","text":"Albert Taylor \\"A.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Bot. Misc. 14 The epithet, lobulata is in reference to the lobed margins of the thallus branches. Distinguishing Features Niebla lobulata is distinguished by a thallus divided into mostly strap-shaped branches from a basal holdfast, the branches not more than 20 in number, wide spreading above a short tapered and narrow base, occasionally dividing into similar branches, the branch margins often wavy (undulate), and/or lobed, or lacerated, the whole thallus not more than 7 cm high. The species (N. lobulata) also recognized by containing sekikaic acid (with triterpenes), and by a relatively thin cortex, (0-)35‚Äì75(-100) ¬µm thick, eroding near base, covering a fistulose medulla (solid on Guadalupe Island), which seems related to the contorted appearance of the branches. The species (N. lobulata) is most similar to Niebla undulata, which differs by having the lichen substance of divaricatic acid, instead of sekikaic acid. Taxonomic History Niebla lobulata was first recognized as distinct from other species in the genus while collecting samples for chemopreventive agents and for anticancer screening on the Vizca√≠no Peninsula near Arroyo San Andr√©s. A 400 gram sample of (N. lobulata) was collected among flowering plants Pachycormus discolor, Encelia stenophylla, Eriogonum encelioides, Eriogonum pondii, Salvia cedrosensis, Petalonyx linearis, Rhus lentii and various other lichens and one desert mushroom identified as having affinity to Battarraea phalloides.Samples of lichens and flowering plants collected for John Cassady, Chairman of the Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy at Purdue University, and later Dean of the School of Pharmacy at Ohio State University. He and his graduate student, Thomas McCloud, had accompanied Richard Spjut on an expedition to Baja California during May 1986. A 400 gram sample N. lobulata was accessioned as WBA-385 (Spjut 9785, Niebla sp. (undescribed). Voucher specimens of the species cited were deposited at the United States National Herbarium (Smithsonian Institution. Samples at Purdue University were later retrieved by Thomas McCloud as manager of the Natural Products extraction lab at Frederick, Maryland. The NCI group maintains an inventory of natural product extracts with details on the collection data. The species (N. lobulata) was also found growing with Niebla usneoides, which also contains sekikaic acid but differs in having isidia (isidium).

History  Originally, Tetz was a Romano - Celtic settlement. The name is attributed to a \\"Deciacum\\", a \\"Good Roman.\\" Through different linguistic transformations, that name became Titzich, then Titze, and finally Tetz. Between the villages of Boslar and Tetz, remains of a former Roman manor were found. In the Middle Ages, Tetz first belonged to the Counts of J√ºlich. After several ownership changes, Tetz finally came into the possession of the Lords of Brachel. The last owner of the castle, Baron Maximilian Freiherr von Brachel, died in 1964. Tetz once had a church, the holy Consecrated Lambertus, that dated to 1291. It was destroyed by German soldiers in WW2 before their withdrawal and the occupation by American troops. The reconstruction of the church continued into the 1950s.  Clubs  Because of the municipal reorganization in 1969, the former municipality of Tetz is now part of the town of Linnich. The town has grown steadily in recent decades by the construction of numerous new business and residential areas. Many clubs have become established. There are modern sports facilities and a multipurpose hall, the Rurauenhalle, which hosts comedy acts and important meetings. Some of the other clubs include: * FC turf sports Tetz * Carnival society \\"Fidele Brothers\\" Tetz * Church choir of St. Joseph Tetz * Schutterij St. Lambertus Tetz * Tennis club green and white Tetz * TTC Tetz * Gymnastic club Tetz 1975 e.

He produced some of the only known images of the early black modern dancer, Edna Guy, and also photographed the modern dancer Harald Kreutzberg. Biography Born in Okayama Prefecture, Japan, on February 18, 1885, he emigrated to the United States in 1905. In 1907 he arrived in Seattle, where he worked alongside Wayne Albee and Frank Kunishige for photographer Ella E. McBride,http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file;_id=8513 the last two of whom were fellow members of the Seattle Camera Club, an association largely made up of Japanese-American immigrant photographers. He also won several awards from an art salon hosted by Frederick & Nelson, a local department store. By 1922, he had moved to New York City, where he briefly worked for photographer Nickolas Muray before enrolling at the Art Students League, alongside classmate Alexander Calder, under the primary tutelage of Ashcan painter John Sloan, after whom he would later name his son. It was in New York that he made the acquaintance of the author Ana√Øs Nin, and thereafter produced many of the photographs of her included in her books. For nearly forty years (from 1930 until 1968) he was the main archival photographer at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, a position that helped him avoid internment during World War II. His friends and admirers included artist Natalie Hays Hammond and MoMA founder Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. He became an American citizen on August 5, 1957, and died on November 12, 1971. Several members of his family followed him into the arts, including son John Soichi Sunami (a public artist), his son-in-law Robert Kopelson (pianist), his granddaughter Julia Kopelson (photographer), his granddaughter Jennifer Sunami (graphic design), his grandson Christopher Andrew-Soichi Sunami (organizer of the Columbus Invitational Arts Competition), and his granddaughter-in-law April Sunami (painter). Exhibitions Starting on October 11, 2018, Cascadia Art Museum of Edmonds, Washington, staged \\"Invocation of Beauty: The Life and Photography of Soichi Sunami,\\" one of the first major retrospectives of Sunami's work since his death. It was accompanied by a new book by art historian David F. Martin. Starting on November 30, 2018 a second retrospective of Sunami's work took place at the Cultural Arts Center in Columbus, Ohio, as part of \\"Generations of Art: The Sunami Family,\\" a group show also featuring work by Sunami family members John, Jennifer and April, and great-grandson River Soichi Sunami. The opening reception also featured a rare, authorized recreation of an original Graham dance, Heretic, as performed by the Columbus Modern Dance Company, as well as music by grandson Christopher (as performed by musicians from the Columbus Symphony Orchestra).

It was designed to provide a similar vehicle to the M2 half-track car. It had the same body and chassis as the M5 half-track (also built by International Harvester for lend-lease) but had the same stowage and radio fit as the M2 half-track. The M9 served for a significant amount of time. Three thousand five-hundred were produced by the end of World War II. It was used during World War II, the Arab-Israeli War of 1948, the Korean War, the Suez Crisis, the Vietnam War, the Six-Day War, and the Yom Kippur War. It had been used by eleven different countries by the end of its service.  Development  The United States adopted half-tracks in large numbers as they could be built more quickly and cheaply by civilian vehicle producers than vehicles from the established armored vehicle manufacturers. The M2 half-track car had first been intended as an artillery tractor, but was also used for carrying the machine gun squads of armored infantry regiments and for reconnaissance units until faster and better-armed M8 Greyhound armored cars were available.Zaloga (1994) p. 4. In order to supply U.S. allies, much more production was required than was possible through the firms producing the M2 (and the larger M3 half- track). International Harvester (IH) could produce half-tracks, but some differences had to be accepted due to different manufacturing methods and components. This led to IH producing for lend-lease the M5 half-track and M9 as equivalents for the M3 and M2 respectively.  Design  The M9 used the same chassis and mechanical components as the M5. It was laid out to provide similar stowage, access to the radios from the inside, rear doors, and a pedestal machine gun mount as with the M2.Berndt (1993) p. 147. The M9A1 variant of the M9 matched the improvements made to the M2, M3, and M5, changing to ring mount machine gun mount and three pintle machine gun mounts.Hunnicutt (2010), p. 46. As with the M5, due to the lack of face- hardened armor, homogenous armor was used. Although thicker, it gave less protection and could be penetrated by armor-piercing rifle bullets from rather than . The armor also made the vehicle heavier, though the performance was essentially similar.  Service history  The M9 started production in August 1942, at IH.Green (2014), p. 280.Foss, p. 421. The M9 and M9A1 were manufactured en masse and 2,026 were produced in total.Berndt (1994) pp. 28‚Äì30 According to American military historian and defense specialist Steven Zaloga, 2,026 M9s and 1,407 M9A1s were produced in 1943.Zaloga (1994), p. 42. The M9 was used in World War II, the Arab-Israeli War of 1948, the Korean War, the Suez Crisis, and many other conflicts. The production of M9s was leased to other countries, like most other IH half-tracks produced in World War II. This M9A1 was leased to both the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, with the latter providing it to other countries in the British Commonwealth.Zaloga (1994), p. 12.Ness (2002), p. 192.  Operators  The M9 was used by many countries but not the United States, as there was sufficient M2 and M3 production for U.S. needs. The UK leased some half-tracks to Free France and other governments-in-exile. The Soviet Union received them directly.Green & Green (2000) p. 147. Following World War II, the second-hand market was a source of supply for some countries, including Israel.Zaloga (1994), pp. 22‚Äì23.

Biography His father was a carpenter. In 1754, he became a student of the scenographer Giovanni Niccol√≤ Servandoni and, the following year, was certified as a \\"Painter of Architecture\\" by the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture. In 1757, he held his first exhibit at the Salon and continued to display his works there until 1802. He began teaching at the Acad√©mie soon after. Demolition of the Church of Saint-Barth√©lemy (1791) In 1764, his trompe-l'≈ìil paintings for the fa√ßade of the new Church of Sainte-Genevi√®ve (now the Panth√©on) earned him an appointment as the decorator of stage sets for the Menus-Plaisirs du Roi.C√©r√©monie de la pose de la premi√®re pierre de la nouvelle √©glise Saint-Genevi√®ve, le 6 septembre 1764 from the Mus√©e Carnavalet Four years later, the Russian Ambassador in Paris presented him with a commission for several tableaux from Catherine the Great. Upon the death of Jean-Fran√ßois Amand, Demachy was assigned his workshop in the Palais du Louvre. His classes were so popular that, in 1777, the Comte d'Angiviller wrote a letter to the Acad√©mie's Director, Jean-Baptiste Marie Pierre, complaining that Demachy's students were \\"polluting the corridors\\" of the Louvre. Ironically, six years later, Pierre asked the Comte to write a letter to Demachy, informing him that he had been granted an annual pension of 500 Livres. In 1784, Demachy took up residence on the first floor of the Louvre. The following year, he applied for and received the position of Professor of Perspective, recently left vacant by the death of Jacques-S√©bastien Leclerc (1734-1785). He would hold that office, with some interruptions, until his own death in 1807.Fr√©d√©ric Chappey, Les Professeurs de l'√âcole des Beaux-Arts ( 1794-1873), from: Romantisme, 1996. #93. pp. 95-101. He apparently weathered the Revolution with no serious consequences. In 1793 and 1794, he was appointed a Deputy to the \\"Commune G√©n√©rale des Arts\\" which temporarily replaced the Acad√©mie.INHA : Proc√®s-verbaux de la Commune g√©n√©rale des arts... Minutes of the Commune's meetings, with introduction and notes by Henry Lapauze He dutifully created a work depicting the \\"Burning of Feudal Titles and the Attributes of Tyranny\\".

Avonmouth Light Railway in blue The Avonmouth Light Railway (ALR) was a nominally independent railway company operating a short standard-gauge branch line from a point on what is now the Severn Beach Line near Avonmouth Docks station in Bristol to a Bristol Corporation electricity installation east of the main entrance to Avonmouth Docks. Its promoters had aspirations which were never fulfilled. History The ALR was a project of the Kingsweston estate owned by the squire of Kingsweston, Dr Philip Napier Miles, and its headquarters were in the Kingsweston estate office in High Street, Shirehampton.Letterhead of surviving correspondence. This estate had owned much of the land in the area; Dr Miles‚Äô father, Philip William Skynner Miles MP, had been responsible for promoting Avonmouth Docks, opened in 1877 on a large tract of his marshland. Acts of Parliament The plan for the line was deposited in November 1902,The National Archives [TNA] document MT 54/384; Bristol Record Office [BRO] document 07790/76. The official depositing of the plans for parliamentary scrutiny is noticed in The London Gazette, 30 June 1903, p. 4095, col. b. Objections and correspondence can be found in BRO document SMV/7/1/4/25. and an order for its construction was obtained in 1903 under the Light Railways Act of 1896; but with the task threatening not to be completed before the period specified in the Act expired, renewal was sought several times and obtained from 1909 to 1912, finally through the Avonmouth Light Railway (Revival and Extension of Time) Order of 1912, again under the Light Railways Act of 1896. The line was nevertheless not completed to the full original specification. Relation to other railway systems The ALR was planned to meet up with other industrial railways developing to serve enterprises further north in the Avonmouth area, but the intended contact never took place. The book of reference of the lineGloucestershire Archives [GA] document Q/RUm/567. specifies that it was to run from Shirehampton (of which Avonmouth was a part at the time) to Henbury, but it never crossed the parish boundary into Henbury.Coates, Richard (2016) \\"The Avonmouth Light Railway.\\" Transactions of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society 134, 231-250. Construction The ALR‚Äôs consulting engineers were Kirkland and Capper of Westminster. Operation The line eventually opened in 1908, probably on 1 April, and was closed on an unknown date but probably about 1931.Mitchell, Vic, and Keith Smith (2004) Branch lines around Avonmouth. Midhurst: Middleton Press, dates in notes to map XII. The line was operated from the start by the Great Western and Midland Joint Railway CommitteeMemorandum of arrangements between Great Western Railway Company, Midland Railway Company and Avonmouth Light Railway Company, Gloucestershire, for supply of rolling stock and through traffic, [to run from] 1 April 1908 to 31 July 1918. TNA document RAIL 252/1544 and transferred in 1927 to the ownership of the Joint Committee‚Äôs successor companies, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the (post-Grouping) Great Western Railway. The ALR never carried paying passengers, and must have been intended solely to transport coal from the Joint Committee‚Äôs sidings to the electricity installation, if this was indeed a generating station. Little is known about the locomotives and rolling stock, operational history or personnel of the line. There are occasional mentions of it in oral history memoirs,Helme, Judy, and Sue Davies, eds (1999) A mouthful of memories. An oral history of Avonmouth; and (2001) Another mouthful of memories. An oral history of Avonmouth. Privately published. but nothing that illuminates its business with precision. It appears that the Great Western Railway kept an engine in a shed by Portview Road to share the duties of servicing a coal yard and taking trucks along the ALR. It was distinguished by the fact that 100% of its staff were called up in the First World War ‚Äì that is, both of them. Route The line started from a Bristol-facing junction with sidings on the Clifton Extension Railway (which ran from Narroways Hill Junction and Kingswood Junction in north Bristol to the port of Avonmouth). This junction was located east of Avonmouth Docks joint station. The stub of the line at its southern end appears as a siding on an Ordnance Survey map of 1949. It crossed several streets on the level in the expanding suburb before setting out across the fields of Avonmouth farm in the direction of a facility variously described as a Bristol Corporation electricity sub-station and as a generating station, and terminating on the western side of this facility in what is now a widened St Andrew‚Äôs Road. It was about long. There is some doubt about whether it was ever extended further. Almost no trace of the line remains in 2015. Gaps between buildings in Portview Road, Davis Street and Avonmouth Road could be discerned by the knowledgeable and interpreted as the course of the line, but building has taken place in some gaps, and the only ones remaining are on both sides of Davis Street (west of numbers 28 and 31) and opposite the Miles Arms hotel in Avonmouth Road. The fields north of the village across which it went have all been built over with warehousing and other commercial development as Avonmouth has expanded, but the disturbed ground marking its course can clearly be followed in post-WW2 aerial photography, cutting across fields still showing the ridge-and-furrow pattern of pre-modern arable farming. The electricity station or sub-station which was its destination is still in existence but derelict.

He lived as a maroon in the mountains until that time. He also served in the war of independence in Cuba. He is known for having his biography published in 1966, in both Spanish and English, several years before his death and when he was already more than 100 years old. After being featured in a newspaper article, Montejo had been contacted in 1963 by Cuban ethnologist Miguel Barnet, who conducted a series of taped interviews with him. From these, he published a book about Montejo's life.Review of Biography of a Runaway Slave, H-Net Biography Esteban Mesa Montejo was born into slavery in 1860 on a sugar-cane plantation in Cuba. He grew up with the Afro-Cuban religion Santer√≠a, which combined Catholicism and elements of Yoruba religion. As a young man he was determined to be free and escaped from the plantation. He fled to the mountains, where there were communities of other maroons, refugee slaves who lived beyond the reach of planters. Cuba did not abolish slavery until 1886, when Montejo was about 26 years old. After that, he worked mostly on farms and plantations, which made up most of the Cuban economy. During the war of independence in 1898, he fought for an independent Cuba. In his last years, he lived in a Veterans' Home. 1962‚Äì1963 to 1970 In 1962 Montejo was one of two people featured in a newspaper article about Cubans who were more than a century old. Both were former slaves. He was contacted by ethnologist Miguel Barnet, who wanted to interview him about his life. Barnet edited the transcripts and published an account of Montejo's life in 1966, as Biograf√≠a de un cimarr√≥n. Montejo and Barnet's book includes descriptions of Afro-Cuban religious expression and of Montejo's life as a fugitive slave. He also recounted his memories of the Cuban war for independence from Spain in 1898, which he fought in. The United States intervened and its military forces occupied Cuba for several years. Barnet ends the book in 1905, following the US occupation of Cuba from 1898 to 1902. An English translation was published in 1966 in the United Kingdom and Australia as The Autobiography of a Runaway Slave.

Reception Reviews for the anime have been generally positive. Amy McNulty from Anime News Network gave the first three episodes of the series an \\"A\\" rating writing that: \\"Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE! should make any anime fan laugh, although long-time fans of magical girl shows will get the jokes better by default. As a parody of a genre that can still entertain in its own right, this series walks the line of critiquing and venerating the magical girl genre with finesse. It's comedic, but it's not a gag-a-minute affair. Yes, it has over-the-top situations, but it's just slightly less believable than the typical magical girl show, so it works. We're not laughing at the show, we're laughing with it.\\" When reviewing the ninth episode, to which she gave an A+ rating, McNulty later wrote that it: \\"demonstrates that the show entertains best when it's both a parody and a magical boy show in its own right. The fact that the boys are able to talk the melon monster down before they heal him with love is another fun twist on the give-speeches-about- justice-to-monster-then-heal-with-love formula. Overall, the viewers spend more time with this monster than any of the previous ones, paving the way for laughs aplenty.\\" Ian Wolf writing for Anime UK News gave the first two episodes a rating of 9 out of 10 saying: \\"Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE! has so far proven itself to be a highly entertaining show, mainly because of the knowing parody it contains. The series mocks all of the normal magical girl tropes, whether it is the poses, the lines that are spouted, the transformations, or the attacks. The only real difference is the fact that you have male characters instead of female ones.\\" He also stated comparisons to shows such as Ouran High School Host Club, a romantic comedy manga which also parodies romantic manga; and Free! in which he compares the similar fan-bases, namely fujoshi, saying: \\"Let's be honest, we all knew that as soon as the concept of five attractive boys akin to magical girls was revealed that every fujoshi and fudanshi was preparing to write quite a lot fan fiction.\\" In a review of the first three episodes Dan Barnett of UK-Anime Network gave the series 7 out of 10 claiming that: \\"Cute High Earth Defence Club Love is a series that has the potential to be a bit of a breakout hit if it plays its cards right. The series is undeniably hilarious as the characters take everything around them seriously, and sexual innuendo flies around so much that it's impossible to keep a straight face. The pains that Wombat must go through to try and avoid being cuddled by Yumoto are fantastically funny too! What might hold it back though is that three episodes in there's little evidence of a plot other than the bog standard 'bad guys make monster of the week' fare that's typical of the genre. ... It's a tricky line to walk if the series wants to keep as wide an audience as possible, though there are certainly fans around who'll happily pick-up another pretty-boy series to fill the void left by Free.\\" References External links  * Category:2015 Japanese television series endings Category:2015 comics endings Category:Anime with original screenplays Category:Diomed√©a Category:Parody anime and manga Category:TV Tokyo original programming Category:Animated television series about teenagers Category:Fictional wombats ","title":"Cute High Earth Defense Club Love!"},{"id":"44896437","text":"El Efecto is a Brazilian rock band, formed in 2002 by Tom√°s Rosati, Bruno Danton and Eduardo Baker.

In Spintires, players take control of off-road vehicles and drive them through muddy off-road terrain to complete objectives. The game was released on June 13, 2014, and has since sold over one million copies. A spin-off game called Spintires: MudRunner was released on October 30, 2017.  Gameplay  An example of gameplay in Spintires. Spintires is an all-terrain simulation video game which tasks driving through muddy unpaved Russian roads in aging Soviet vehicles with nothing but a map and a compass. The aim of the game is to transport cargo to its destination without depleting resources (such as fuel) or damaging the vehicle. There is both a single-player and multiplayer mode. The game takes into account several properties such as physics, mud, terrain deformation, as well as driving controls and a day/night cycle. Due to the challenging terrain, players must take all conditions into consideration and drive accordingly; for example, they cannot simply just press \\"forward\\" on their keyboard to drive straight. Players can choose between casual and hardcore mode. In hardcore mode, fuel consumption is increased and routes the player charts on the map won't be displayed as a guide on the road as they drive. The game's camera is positioned outside the vehicle and can be moved around using the mouse; there is no in-car view.  Development  The game initially raised $82,684 on Kickstarter in 2013. A few days following its release, Spintires briefly became the top-selling video game on the Steam platform, and a month after it still retained a position in the Steam Top 10, selling over 100,000 copies. In 2014, one of the developers Pavel Zagrebelny alleged that Oovee took the money and cut off communication, which left him unable to update it. Oovee, however, has denied the allegations, saying Zagrebelnyj has been paid in full for the work he completed and that there is no breach of contract on the side of Oovee. Later, both Oovee and Zagrebelnyj attributed the dispute to \\"communications issues\\", and said that an eventual sequel to Spintires was a possibility. In December 2015, Oovee opened up the game to its player base with Steam Workshop support, seeing the release of its truck and map editor. A news post on the Spintires Steam page by Oovee, suggested that Spintires was not over as many had suggested, and showed signs of further graphical improvements and additions to gameplay. Throughout 2019, Spintires has received numerous updates including fixes, graphical enhancements and DLC.  Release and reception  Spintires was released on June 13, 2014, and had sold more than 100,000 copies by July. Spintires has received mixed reviews. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer placed Spintires onto the site's \\"Games of 2014\\", writing, \\"Spintires can make a set-piece out of a puddle. Spintires can make precisely zero mph feel like knuckle-splintering stuff. Spintires is a roguelike in which you load the game up, roll a wheeled character, and see how far you can get on a single tank of gas\\", and that it was \\"ugly but beautiful, and fixated with the beauty of ugliness.\\" Andy Kelly, for PC Gamer, scored Spintires 60/100, commending the game's gameplay and variety of vehicles. However, he also found fault with the game's limited scope and camera system, writing, \\"[...] as endearingly bizarre as I find Spintires, and as much as I admire the technology, I can't say I really ever enjoyed it. There are moments of what I could loosely call excitement‚Äîlike almost rolling over and spilling my load just metres from the delivery point, or thinking I was crossing a shallow pond only to become totally submersed in a river‚Äîbut they're few and far between. Mostly I just find myself swearing at mud.\\" James Cunningham in Hardcore Gamer praised the game, stating, \\"[...] Spintires is a game that wants people to play rather than work. The great outdoors is big and beautiful, and the maps have plenty of personality and memorable locations, but they‚Äôre also the enemy. The inviting gameplay and lovely scenery make it easy to underestimate what an unforgiving bastard the great outdoors can be, but it only takes getting irretrievably stuck a couple of times before that illusion gets shattered. After that it‚Äôs time to stomp the scenery flat with the biggest earth-gouging, fume belching trucks Spintires has to offer.\\" Phil Hartup of New Statesman rated Spintires as the video game with the Best Visuals of 2014, claiming, \\"What I saw in Spintires was mud. The best mud I have ever seen in a game. I saw mud that splattered and squelched and I saw water that flowed around in the treads of the tyres of my truck and pooled in the mud furrows. I would stare at it, and not just because I was often hopelessly stuck. It might be a low key game about trucks and trees, but there are a lot that other games should learn from Spintires.\\" Controversy It was alleged by developer and publisher Oovee, that lead developer and original creator of the game, Pavel Zagrebelnyy, sabotaged the game code in retaliation for alleged financial misconduct by Oovee against the developer. Zagrebelnyy eventually cooperated with Oovee to fix game-breaking bugs and with both denying that the bugs were introduced deliberately.https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2017/11/02/the-story-behind-spintires- mudrunner-steams-newest-hithttps://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-02-24-the- bumpy-road-of-spintires-development However in 2015, Zegrebelnyy started working at Saber Interactive, a former employer of his, to aid development of Spintires: MudRunnerhttps://twitter.com/focushome/status/898526143002890241?lang=en and Oovee licensed some parts of the game to Saber Interactive.

The film stars Irene Fenwick, Owen Moore, Thomas O'Keefe, Eddie Sturgis, Harry Lee and John T. Dillon. The film was released on January 18, 1917, by Paramount Pictures. The film is now lost.The Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog:A Girl Like That Plot Nell Gordon (Fenwick) is unfortunate in her ancestry; her father is a crook, but she possesses qualities of resourcefulness and loyalty. Though she love her father, she detests his associates, particularly one, Bill Whipple (O'Keefe), who is her constant suitor, Joe Dunham (Sturgis), who does the scouting for the trio, finds a likely bank in the town of Wheaton, the fact that a new bookkeeper is needed there opening a way for the gang to get into the bank, as Nell is an expert. Working on her love for her father, who is a very sick man, Whipple and Dunham persuade Nell to go to Wheaton and take the position. Boarding with Rev. Dr. Singleton, Nell wins the confidence of Jim Brooks (Moore), the cashier of the bank, and of Tom Hoadley (Dillon), his best friend and sheriff of the country. What the girl is working for, of course, is the combination of the safe, but before she has a chance to get it, she begins to realize that she is in love with cashier. On the very day that she learns the combination and copies it. Jim proposes to her, and, after a mental struggle, she decides that her love for him is greater than her loyalty to the gang, and she surrenders, concealing her identity, she had come to the town under an assumed name. Becoming suspicious of Nell's Delay in forwarding word to them, Whipple and Dunham attempt to force her father to write a note ordering her to act quickly, but the old man refuses and is shot. The crook go to Wheaton and try to force Nell to rob the bank. She has undergone complete reformation and has even confessed her identity to Jim's friend and is planning to leave Wheaton rather than bring disgrace upon the man she love. She discovers that her father has been murdered by the crooks and decides to be revenged. Apparently consenting to their demands, she gets them into the bank, but not until she has warned the sheriff. Nell is wounded in the fight which follows, and when she awakens finds herself in the arms of the man from whom she attempt to escape because she loved him.

Family Peach was born in Toronto, Canada to parents from Nottinghamshire, England. When he was three years old, the family returned to Britain and lived in Oadby, Leicestershire where his father worked as an estate agent. He attended Wyggeston Boys‚Äô Grammar School and Oakham School. Peach married twice. With his first wife, Marina, he had six children, one of whom died in infancy. Marina died in 1913. In 1915, he married Mabel Watson. Peach died on 24 January 1936 at his home in Leicester. He had suffered from neuritis throughout his life and periods of ill health during the 1930s. Business Dryad advertisement from 1910 After leaving school, Peach worked with his father for a short time before opening a specialist bookshop in Leicester dealing in manuscripts and early printed books. By 1906, Peach's eyesight was failing and he gave up selling books. In 1907, he set up Dryad Furniture to manufacture cane furniture with his friend Benjamin Fletcher as the main designer and a workforce of four. ( He had been asked by his father-in-law for a cane chair for his billiard room) At the time the market was dominated by European manufacturers and Peach and Fletcher wanted to develop the local cane industry to compete and supply furniture suitable for the English market. Dryad supplied cane deck lounger chairs for White Star Lines ships, including the Titanic.personal research with the Titanic Museum. By 1912, the company had expanded to a workforce of 50 and moved into larger premises where he established Dryad Metal Works to supply architectural and household fittings manufactured in copper, brass and wrought iron. Fletcher had introduced Peach to the writings of William Morris and William Lethaby and other members of the Arts and Crafts movement and many of the Dryad designs were in the arts and crafts style. By 1914, the companies employed nearly 200 staff. During World War I, Peach began promoting craft work as a form of occupational therapy for wounded and disabled servicemen and donated large quantities of cane offcuts for this purpose. Identifying the growing demand for craft materials for domestic and educational purposes, Peach established Dryad Handicrafts to supply materials, instructional leaflets and designs and organise classes. By the time of his death, Dryad Handicrafts was the largest supplier of craft materials in the world. Following his death, the Dryad companies were run by his elder and younger sons, Geoffrey and Roger Peach. Public campaigns Peach and his first wife were involved in social reform and politics and were members of the Independent Labour Party. In 1906, to support Ramsay MacDonald's campaign to be elected as one of Leicester's members of parliament, Peach organised an exhibition on the poor industrial working conditions in the city. Marina Peach was also involved in the suffragette movement and campaigned for the improvement of health care for working class women. In 1915, Peach was a founder member of the Design and Industries Association (DIA). The DIA was set up to promote better relationships between manufacturers, designers and retailers and to \\"foster a more intelligent understanding amongst the public for what is best and soundest in design\\" and was inspired by the Deutscher Werkbund's 1914 Cologne exhibition. Peach was also active in campaigns to preserve the countryside and prevent the uncontrolled expansion of towns and cities and unregulated advertising. He was the secretary of the Leicestershire Footpath Association from 1912, a long-term member of the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Society and was the Honorary Secretary of the exhibitions committee for the Council for the Preservation of Rural England (now the Campaign to Protect Rural England), for which he organised many exhibitions and lectured. The DIA's 1930 yearbook edited with Noel Carrington and titled The Face of the Land brought his proposals together. Legacy Peach was involved in the founding of Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland University College (now Leicester University) and served on its board of governors. The College was founded on Armistice Day 1918, with seven original private benefactors, which is unique. He was a major benefactor of the college and material he donated to the college forms part of the University Library's core special collection. The School of Law's library is named after him. After his death a memorial fund was raised which funds the biennial Harry Hardy Peach Lecture, organised by the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society. A collection of handicrafts amassed by Peach was given to Leicester Museum in 1969. Pat Kirkham wrote a detailed biography .

Subterete: compressed along two side, elliptical in cross-section. Prismatic‚Äîshaped like a prism in cross section branches from a common attachment base (or holdfast); the primary branches often tubular inflated near base with a glossy smooth cortex, dividing frequently into equal secondary branches above, the branches wide spreading, arcuate or horseshoe shaped, densely tangled together, terminally flexuous or whip-like; the whole thallus to 15 cm in diameter and 6 cm high. The species (N. marinii) also recognized by containing salazinic acid, without triterpenes, but often with an unknown, possibly scabrosin derivative. PycnidiaPycnidium (pycnidia plural) is a small flash-shaped structure (200‚Äì450 Œºm wide near the base in N. homaleoides) that produces conidia, which escape through an opening (ostiole) at the top and function in reproduction, asexually or sexuallyBungartz, F. 2002. Morphology and anatomy of conidia- producing structures, Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 1: 35‚Äì40 are prominent at tips of branches and on the upper parts of branches. Niebla josecuervoi is similar, differing in the numerous short spine-like branchlets along the upper side of primary branches, the branches appearing comb-like. Niebla marinii‚Äîconsistent in its morphological features at specific locations but variable in cortical features when viewed collectively from all locations‚Äîmay possibly comprise two species, one of which has distinctly raised cortical ridges. This may be a hybrid with Niebla siphonoloba.Niebla siphonoloba, World Botanical Associates, retrieved 28 Dec 2014, http://www.worldbotanical.com/niebla_siphonoloba.htm Evidence for hybridization is seen by the same morphological variation in another species; one that has the bushy habit and smooth cortex of N. marinii, Niebla suffnessii as found at its type locality‚ÄîCerro Elefante on the Vizca√≠no Peninsula. Approximately 200 miles north of Cerro Elefante‚Äîwhich is about halfway up the northern Baja peninsula and just north of Punta Canoas‚Äîare both N. marinii and N. suffnessii that occur together on Mesa Camacho‚Äîa red lava mesa, 300‚Äì400 m in elevation. At this location, the thalli of both species have conspicuously raised sinuous (short wavy) cortical ridges; proposed species names have been suggested, one for the salazinic acid species,Niebla marinii, World Botanical Associates, retrieved 28 Dec 2014, http://www.worldbotanical.com/niebla_marinii.htm the other for the sekikaic acid species.Niebla suffnessii, World Botanical Associates, retrieved 28 Dec 2014, http://www.worldbotanical.com/niebla_suffnessii.htm Although the same species of Niebla can vary in a particular feature such as in its cortical ridge patterns, it may also retain other morphological and chemical taxonomic features at different locations; in this case, Niebla marinii has the wide angle branching (horseshoe-shaped branchlets) and prominent pycnidia at both locations, whereas N. suffnessii has inconspicuous pycnidia and long drawn-out branches at both locations. Sinuous cortical ridges are generally characteristic of the sekikaic-acid species Niebla siphonoloba throughout its geographical range, and it occurs frequently on Mesa Camacho. This species (N. siphonoloba) is recognized by its simple stubby branches in addition to having sekikaic acid and a prominent reticulated (honeycomb-like) cortex. A logical explanation for the occurrence of the distinct cortical sinuous ridges in N. marinii and N. suffnessii on Mesa Camacho is hybridization,Robinson, H.1975.

As a further example, in the Channel Islands (Santa Cruz Island), N. siphonoloba is suspected to hybridize with another sekikaic-acid species Niebla fimbriata as seen by their intermediates. The morphological variation in Niebla marinii, N. suffnessii and N. siphonoloba are just a few examples of the broad spectrum of morphological variation that can be found in each species, referred as morpho-syndrome variation, in contrast to chemo-syndromes recognized in the related genus Ramalina.Culberson, W.

It was built in the 1940s. It is also known as RAN Station 9, Myrtletown. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 July 2008.  History  The remaining built elements of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) Station 9, a World War II-era indicator loop and photo-electric (PE) beam monitoring complex, are located in Myrtletown Reserve, at the end of Gannon Road near Pinkenba. The concrete control and generator hut still stand at the southeast corner of the reserve, along with a number of concrete slabs from the quarters and mess building. The site of RAN Station 9, located on the northern bank of Boggy Creek where it joins the Brisbane River, was gazetted as a Reserve for Recreation in 1885. A Reserve for Landing was located just to the north, and both reserves were initially under the control of the Toombul Divisional Board. In January 1925 both reserves, now jointly known as Myrtletown Reserve (), were transferred to the Brisbane City Council, which remains the trustee. The Myrtletown area, formerly an agricultural district, is now an industrial zone, with large undeveloped blocks and few houses. Most residents left due to the closure of the local school in 1971 and the construction of Brisbane Airport nearby (which opened in 1988). During World War II the coastal artillery defences of Moreton Bay were upgraded. These included Fort Lytton (1880-1881) (now Fort Lytton National Park) on the southern side of the Brisbane River's mouth and Fort Cowan Cowan (late 1930s) (Fort Cowan Cowan), on the west side of Moreton Island. Fort Bribie (Bribie Island Second World War Fortifications), at the northeast tip of Bribie Island, was established in 1939 after Germany's invasion of Poland plunged the world into war. Japan's entry into the war on 7 December 1941, and the consequent perceived invasion threat to Australia, led to a further expansion of Moreton Bay's defences. Fort Bribie upgraded its two 6\\" gun emplacements in early 1942, and in June 1942, the Commander of the Allied Naval Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area requested as a matter of high priority that Moreton Bay be developed as a naval operating base. Later that year two American field guns were emplaced on Panama Mounts at Skirmish Point (Bribie Island Second World War Fortifications), at the south end of Bribie Island. In 1943 a similar battery was built at Rous, on the east side of Moreton Island. The major access route into the Brisbane River was the Northwest Channel, which ran from near Caloundra across the bay in a southeast direction (east of Bribie Island and towards Moreton Island) and then southwest towards the mouth of the Brisbane River, forming a Z-shaped route. This dictated the ideal positions for coastal artillery batteries, with the most effective sites for guns being the closest points to the channel bends. However, Rous battery was designed to deter ships from shelling targets within Moreton Bay from the ocean side of Moreton Island. During World War II, Moreton Bay was also protected by RAN stations numbers 1 through 10. RAN 1 was a Port War Signal Station at Wickham Point, Caloundra (not extant), and RAN 2 was a Controlled Mining and Guard Loop Station which was initially located at Fort Bribie (extant), before it was moved to Tangalooma on Moreton island in 1943 (not extant). RAN 3 was a Controlled Mining and Guard Loop Station at Cowan Cowan, and RAN 4 was the Indicator Loop and Harbour Defence ASDIC (anti-submarine detection sonar) Station at Woorim (Bribie Island Second World War Fortifications), on Bribie Island (extant). RAN 5 was the Combined Training Centre (Naval Wing), at Toorbul; RAN 6 was an Advanced Fairmile Base (AFMB) at Bongaree, Bribie Island; and RAN 7 was an Indicator Loop and Harbour Defence ASDIC Station at Bulwer on Moreton Island (extant). On the Brisbane River, RAN 8 was the Boom Defence Facility, an anti-submarine boom across the Brisbane River between Lytton and Bulwer Island (not extant); RAN 9 was the Indicator Loop and Photo-electric Beam Station, Myrtletown (extant); and RAN 10 was a Naval Store at Pinkenba (status unknown). Indicator loops were used to detect the presence of any submerged submarines. An indicator loop relies on the production of an induced current in a stationary loop of wire when a magnet moves overhead. Even if wiped or degaussed, submarines still have sufficient magnetism to produce a small current in a loop. The technology was developed by the British Royal Navy at HMS Osprey (Portland Naval Base) from 1915. If an indicator loop showed the presence of a vessel the two possibilities were \\"sub\\" or \\"non-sub\\". If no ship could be observed on the water, it was obviously a submarine, and a vessel could be despatched to drop depth charges. Alternatively, if an indicator loop was located next to a controlled minefield, in which the mines were connected by electrical cable back to a mine control hut on shore, the mines could be detonated manually if a submarine was detected. It had to be an enemy submarine as friendly submarines always entered port surfaced. The controlled mines in Moreton Bay were accompanied by \\"guard\\" indicator loops and mine loops. When a submarine was detected by the guard loop, the operator would wait until there was also a galvanometer \\"swing\\" on the mine loop and then the mines would be detonated by sending a current down the mine loop. RAN Station 9 was designed to detect any Japanese submarines or surface vessels attempting to navigate up the Brisbane River. By 1942, the navy had become aware of recent developments by Japan, Germany and Italy in the manufacture and use of miniature submarines and human torpedoes. Existing indicator loop systems had legs set at a 200-yard spacing which was fine for large submarines but useless for the miniatures. By September 1942 the RAN decided to lay a miniature indicator loop across the mouth of the Brisbane River. The indicator loop cables were laid in a miniature indicator loop pattern with legs apart, from RAN Station 9 to Fisherman Islands. If a submerged submarine was detected by RAN Station 9 a signal would be transmitted to RAN Station 8, the Boom Defence Facility at Fort Lytton, to raise the boom cable. HMAS Kinchela was permanently moored in the Brisbane River as part of this Boom Defence system. The indicator loop was completed by HMAS Bangalow by early March 1943. The indicator loop was supplemented with a photo-electric beam above the water, to detect the presence of surface vessels entering the Brisbane River. RAN Station 9 in Brisbane was one of only three photo-electric beam installations built in Australia during World War II, the others being between South Head and Middle Head in Sydney, and between Point Lonsdale and Point Nepean at Port Phillip in Melbourne. Lieutenant Colonel Buckland of the Australian Army was responsible for the installation of all three. The PE Beam equipment consisted of a transmitter on the Fisherman Islands side of the Brisbane River housed in a concrete hut, at a bearing of 68 degrees and 25 minutes from the receiver at Myrtletown. The current status of the transmitting hut is unknown, due to the development of wharfage facilities around that location. The PE beam transmitter consisted of a power valve that transmitted in the visible and infrared wavelengths. An infrared screen blocked out the visible light so that it couldn't be seen from the outside. The beam from the transmitter was directed at the reflector (a parabolic mirror) in the control hut at Myrtletown, which focussed the rays to a pin point on the cathode of the PE cell. Breaking the beam closed a contactor on to an 80 Volt DC supply and connected it in parallel with a service contactor. While the beam was in normal operation, a loudspeaker gave a buzzing note. When the beam was broken, the speaker reproduced the clicking of the receiver relay. An alarm buzzer also sounded and a flashing red light came on actuated by the relay. During this interruption, another contactor closed and a sentry (searchlight) was exposed across the river, on a bearing a few degrees inside the line of the infrared PE beam. The service contactor switch for the searchlight was then closed by the switchman, who carried out a quick search of the area; the control panel contactor being immediately reset by pressing a button on the control panel. Resetting stopped the alarm buzzer, flashing light and the clicking in the loudspeaker, leaving the apparatus ready to give another signature immediately. The PE beam was completed in September 1943 and on 23 October 1943 the first trial of the beam was undertaken. RAN Station 9 commenced operation in January 1944, after a construction cost of . Lieutenant Joe Duggan was the Officer in Charge. RAN Station 9 never detected any Japanese intruders, although submarines had been sighted east of Stradbroke Island (March 1942) and off Moreton Island (June 1942), and on 14 May 1943 the hospital ship Centaur was struck by a torpedo and sunk off the Brisbane coastline. The last attack to occur in the approaches to the Port of Brisbane took place on 4 June 1943 off Cape Moreton, when a Japanese submarine fired on the American ship MV Edward Chambers. The indicator loop in the Brisbane River was removed in June 1945. A 1946 aerial photograph of the RAN Station 9 facility shows that the quarters and mess building were located to the north of the control and generator huts (at the location of the existing concrete slabs and brick cisterns). Two outhouses were located northwest of the existing generator hut. The larger of the two remaining structures, the control hut, accommodated the indicator loop and PE beam instrumentation and was where the loop cables terminated. The smaller building housed the generator. The living quarters for officers and ordinary ranks were separated by a mess area.  Description  Control hut, 2015 The surviving structures of the former RAN Station 9 stand at the southeast corner of a reserve at the end of Gannon Road in Myrtletown. A rough dirt roadway continues from the end of Gannon Road along the southwest edge of the reserve, and Sandmere Road is gazetted but unformed along the northwest side of the reserve. The reserve contains two concrete buildings, with other ruined concrete structures and concrete slabs to the north. The wartime concrete structures contrast with the green and peaceful nature of the well-groomed riverside park. The buildings are single-storey rectangular concrete structures with flat concrete roofs concealed by the parapet edges formed by the perimeter walls. The structures were cast in-situ and the walls and ceilings display an off-form finish. Glazing has been lost to all the window openings and most doors are lost. Steel grill security screens have been fixed to all openings. The control hut is made of concrete thick and is approximately . It stands close to the park edge at Boggy Creek, aligned southwest-northeast. The rectangular plan is divided into even quarters with three enclosed rooms and an open entry courtyard in the southwest quarter. There are two doorways off the open courtyard, protected by a freestanding blast wall. The door to the northwest opens into a fully enclosed room (former workshop and store) which connects to a room to the northeast (former indicator loop room). The storeroom contains an uninstalled louvered timber door, leant up against the wall. The indicator loop room has a single narrow unglazed observation window at eye height on the northeast corner. This narrow opening is sheltered by an external cantilevered tapered concrete hood. The door to the northeast of the courtyard leads into a room at the southeast corner of the building (PE beam receiver room). The floor level of this room is below the ground level and is reached by a small flight of concrete stairs. The PE Beam receiver room has a large low unglazed window opening to the northeast (PE beam opening) and a larger window/doorway to the southeast. Many of the wall openings in the structure contain remnants of timber framing. A concrete slab and kerbing lie to the south and west of the structure. To the northwest of the control hut is the concrete generator hut, which is about by . The generator hut consists of a large rectangular room (generator room) and an adjacent smaller narrow rectangular room (store) both opening onto a small enclosed rectangular entrance corridor with an external door to the southwest corner. The generator room has long narrow unglazed windows at eye height to the northeast and southeast. Both openings have external cantilevered tapered concrete hoods. One opening contains the timber window frame. The interior of the generator room contains a concrete mounting on the floor, as well as some freestanding thick timber framing. Two rectangular concrete slabs lie northeast of the generator hut. Park and concrete slabs, 2015 There is a scatter of trees, a picnic shelter and barbeque facilities to the northwest of the two concrete huts, but these features are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. To the north of the huts is a rectangular raised area with remnant low concrete walls, with a concrete slab to its northwest. These features mark the site of the quarters and mess building. Located to the north and south ends of the quarters site, to its northeast, are two rectangular brick cisterns, rendered with concrete. Each has a round pipe opening on top of one end, and a modern metal cover with a hatch at the other end. The cisterns were probably the septic systems for the living quarters.  Heritage listing  RAN Station 9, Pinkenba (Myrtletown) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 July 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The surviving concrete huts and the concrete remnants of the quarters and mess building at RAN Station 9 at Pinkenba (Myrtletown) are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, being surviving evidence of the efforts made to defend Moreton Bay and the Brisbane River against enemy ships and submarines during World War II. The indicator loop and photo-electric beam installation at Myrtletown was part of an interlocking system of naval defences for Moreton Bay, which incorporated coastal artillery batteries, indicator loops, controlled minefields, ASDIC (anti-submarine sonar detection) devices, Fairmile anti-submarine motor launches, a photoelectric (PE) beam and an anti-submarine boom. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. RAN Station 9 was one of only three PE beam harbour defence installations constructed in Australia during World War II. The others were constructed between South Head and Middle Head in Sydney, and between Point Lonsdale and Point Nepean at Port Phillip in Melbourne. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. RAN Station 9, by its location, orientation to the river, and room layout, is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a World War II indicator loop and PE beam station, an anti-submarine defence. Its location next to the Brisbane River demonstrates the need to detect enemy vessels attempting to infiltrate upriver, and the placement of the control hut reveals the bearing of the PE beam transmitted from Fisherman Islands. The layout of the rooms in the control hut provide evidence of the functions of such a facility, with the indicator loop room having an observation window over the river and the PE beam room having a large window to receive the beam transmitted from Fisherman Islands. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. As incongruous concrete structures in a quiet area of flat, well maintained grassland along the north bank of Boggy Creek as it joins the Brisbane River, the remaining buildings and foundations of RAN Station 9 are a picturesque but poignant reminder of attempts to defend shipping in the Brisbane River from Japanese submarine attacks.

It has reportedly also been used in birth control pills. OHPA is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. OHPA was discovered in 1953 and was introduced for medical use in 1956. Medical uses OHPA has been used in the treatment of a variety of gynecological disorders, including secondary amenorrhea, functional uterine bleeding, infertility, habitual abortion, dysmenorrhea, and premenstrual syndrome. OHPA (100 mg) was reportedly marketed in combination with mestranol (80 Œºg) as a sequential combined birth control pill under the brand name Hormolidin. The preparation was available in the early 1970s. The firm that manufactured it, known as Gador, was based in Argentina. Available forms Side effects Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics OHPA is a progestogen and acts as an agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR), both PRA and PRB isoforms (IC50 = 16.8 nM and 12.6 nM, respectively). It has more than 50-fold higher affinity for the PR isoforms than 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone, a little less than half the affinity of progesterone, and slightly higher affinity than OHPC. Additional studies have reported on the affinity of OHPA for the PR. OHPA is of relatively low potency as a progestogen, which may explain its relatively limited use. It is 100-fold less potent than medroxyprogesterone acetate, 400-fold less potent than chlormadinone acetate, and 1,200-fold less potent than cyproterone acetate in animal assays. In terms of producing full progestogenic changes on the endometrium in women, 75 to 100 mg/day oral OHPA is equivalent to 20 mg/day parenteral progesterone, and OHPA is at least twice as potent as oral ethisterone in such regards. It is also reportedly more potent than OHPC. OHPA has been found to be effective as an oral progestogen-only pill at a dosage of 30 mg/day. Pharmacokinetics OHPA has very low but nonetheless significant oral bioavailability and can be taken by mouth. The pharmacokinetics of OHPA have been reviewed. A single intramuscular injection of 150 to 350 mg OHPA in microcrystalline aqueous suspension has been found to have a duration of action of 9 to 16 days in terms of clinical biological effect in the uterus in women. Chemistry OHPA, also known as 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone acetate or as 17Œ±-acetoxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is the acetate ester of 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone, as well as a parent compound of a number of progestins including chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate. Synthesis Chemical syntheses of OHPA have been described. History In 1949, it was discovered that 17Œ±-methylprogesterone had twice the progestogenic activity of progesterone when administered parenterally, and this finding led to renewed interest in 17Œ±-substituted derivatives of progesterone as potential progestins. Along with OHPC, OHPA was synthesized by Karl Junkmann of Schering AG in 1953 and was first reported by him in the medical literature in 1954. OHPC shows very low oral activity and was introduced for use via intramuscular injection by Squibb in 1956 under the brand name Delalutin. Although a substantial prolongation of action occurs when OHPC is formulated in oil, the same was not observed to a significant extent with OHPA, and this is likely why OHPC was chosen by Schering for development over OHPA. Subsequently, Upjohn unexpectedly discovered that OHPA, unlike OHPC and progesterone, is orally active and shows marked progestogenic activity with oral administration, a finding that had been missed by the Schering researchers (who were primarily interested in the oil solubility of such esters). OHPA was found to possess two to three times the oral activity of 17Œ±-methylprogesterone. Upjohn reported the oral activity of OHPA in the medical literature in 1957 and introduced the drug for medical use as Prodox in 25 mg and 50 mg oral tablet formulations later the same year. OHPA was indicated for the treatment of a variety of gynecological disorders in women. However, it saw relatively little use, which was perhaps due its comparatively low potency relative to a variety of other progestins such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone. These progestins were introduced around the same time and hence may have been favored. In 1960, OHPA was introduced also as Prodox as an oral progestin for veterinary use for the indication of estrus suppression in dogs. However, probably due its high cost and the inconvenience of daily oral administration, the drug was not a market success. It was superseded for this indication by medroxyprogesterone acetate (brand name Promone) in 1963, which could be administered by injection conveniently once every six months, although this preparation was discontinued in 1966 for various reasons and hence was not a market success either. Society and culture Generic names Hydroxyprogesterone acetate is the generic name of the drug and its . Brand names OHPA is or was marketed under the brand name Prodox initially for clinical use and then for veterinary use. Other brand names of OHPA include Gestageno, Gestageno Gador, Kyormon, Lutate-Inj, Prodix, and Prokan. OHPA may also be or have been marketed in combination with estradiol enantate under the brand names Atrimon and Protegin in Argentina and Nicaragua. Availability OHPA is no longer marketed and hence is no longer available in any country.https://www.drugs.com/international/hydroxyprogesterone.html See also * Mestranol/hydroxyprogesterone acetate References Category:Abandoned drugs Category:Acetate esters Category:Enones Category:Pregnanes Category:Progestogen esters Category:Progestogens Category:Veterinary drugs ","title":"Hydroxyprogesterone acetate"},{"id":"44897386","text":"Joe Ciaravino (born October 26, 1976) is a Canadian former soccer player who played as goalkeeper who played in the Canadian National Soccer League, USL A-League, and at the international level with the Canada men's national under-17 soccer team.

The main difference with traditional perimetry instruments is that, microperimetry includes a system to image the retina and an eye tracker to compensate eye movements during visual field testing. Usage Macular degeneration Visual field testing is widely used to monitor pathologies affecting the periphery of vision such as glaucoma. During a conventional test, patients are asked to look steady (fixate) at a visual target, while light stimuli are projected at varying intensities in different retinal locations. This process is not, however, considered accurate in the evaluation of pathologies affecting the central part of the retina (macula and fovea centralis) patients with these pathologies are often unable to fixate reliably. By contrast, fundus perimetry, produces reliable results even in patients with unstable or eccentric fixation., or advance macular degeneration. When central vision is compromised, as in the case of macular scotoma, patients develop an eccentric or extra-foveal vision, normally with unstable fixation. The retinal area used by eccentric viewers to substitute the foveal vision is known as the Preferred Retinal Locus (PRL) In Microperimetry systems, the fundus (eye) is imaged in real time, while an eye tracker compensates eye movements during stimuli projection, allowing correct matching between expected and projected stimulus position onto the retina. Simultaneously, the eye tracker plots the retinal movement during fixation attempt defining the PRL zone as well as fixation stability. Some microperimetry instruments calculate 2 different PRL zones during the examination. To create the fundus image an infrared telecamera is used, as in the case of the \\"Nidek-MP1\\", or a Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (SLO), as in the case of the \\"Centervue-MAIA\\". Microperimetry with Biofeedback In patients with central vision loss, microperimetry experts are able to analyse the eccentric retina in order to find zones with good retinal sensitivity. Once the best retinal area is selected, patients are asked to move their gaze towards that direction, while audio signals guide them to the desired target. This process is called biofeedback, and is based on the theory of brain plasticity. With several training sessions, some patients are able to gain better use of their peripheral vision.

She made two complete trips to India for the British East India Company (EIC) and was on her third trip, this one to China, when French privateers or warships captured her on 27 September 1793. The French Navy took her into service in the Indian Ocean as a 34-gun frigate under the name Duguay Trouin. The Royal Navy recaptured her and she returned to British merchant service. In 1797 she performed one more voyage for the EIC. She received a letter of marque in July 1798 but was captured in October 1799 off the coast of Sumatra. EIC Captain James Horncastle commanded Princess Royal on all three of her voyages, including her last. EIC voyage #1 (1787-88) Horncastle left the Downs on 6 January 1787, bound for Madras, Bengal, and Bombay. Capt James Horncastle. Princess Royal reached the Cape on 3 April, and arrived at Madras on 6 June. From there she sailed to Calcutta, arriving at Diamond Harbour on 18 June. For her return trip, she passed Saugor on 16 November, and reached Bombay on 12 February 1788. She reached St Helena on 12 June and arrived at the Downs on 22 August. During this voyage Horncastle and Princess Royal reportedly fought an action in the Straits of Malacca,Hardy (1835), p.160. though it is not clear against whom. EIC voyage #2 (1790-91) Horncastle left the Downs on 26 April 1790, bound for Bombay. Princess Royal reached Johanna on 12 August and arrived at Bombay on 3 September. From there she sailed to Tellicherry, which she reached on 7 October, Anjengo (27 October), and Tellicherry again (14 November), before returning to Bombay on 30 November. For her return trip she reached Tellicherry on 7 January 1791, the Cape on 3 March, and St Helena on 22 March. She arrived at the Downs on 13 May. EIC voyage #3 and capture (1793-capture) Horncastle left the Downs on 5 April 1793, bound for St Helena and China. The French Revolutionary Wars had begun two months earlier so Horncastle received a letter of marque dated 28 February 1793. This would permit him to engage in offensive action against the French should the opportunity present itself. Princess Royal reached St Helena on 11 July. Unfortunately, on 29 September three French warships captured her off Anger (or Anjere) Point while she was still on her way to China. H. Couperus, the Dutch governor of Malacca, wrote a letter on 15 December 1793 to the English captains there that a letter from Batavia dated 29 September reported that three French warships had attacked and captured Princess Royal. The letter further reported that the French ships mounted about 120 guns between them. Captain Bampton, of Hormazeer, arrived with a cargo of sugar from Batavia that he picked up after delivering a cargo to Botany Bay. He reported that he had seen three French ships at Batavia, two of 50 guns and one of 44 guns. Another report, this by Captain Simpson of Carron, stated that three French warships were cruising off the coast of Canton. He described them as a 64-gun, a 44-gun, and a 20-gun vessel; they had a large number of troops aboard and were believed responsible for Princess Royals capture.Houghton, Roger - A Peoples' History 1793 ‚Äì 1844 from the newspapers: Prize-taking, - accessed 29 December 2014. A later account reports that the three privateers were the 36-gun Dumouriez, 32-gun La Libert√©, and 28-gun √âgalit√©. Horncastle fought for an hour before striking. Princess Royal had two men killed and three wounded.Biden (1830), pp203-4. Her captors took Princess Royal to √éle de France. There she was sold; reportedly, \\"Prize-taking has become so lucrative on Mauritius that bidding for the fast-sailing Princess Royal was fierce and she sold for 2,400,000 livres.\\" Lloyd's List reported that she was in Mauritius being fitted out as a privateer.Lloyd's List, no.2589, - accessed 30 December 2014. The French Navy requisitioned her and renamed her Duguay Trouin. French naval service On 25 January 1794, Duguay Trouin, under the command of Julien Th√©rouart, was in the Sunda Strait as part of a French naval squadron from √éle de France, that also included the frigates Prudente and Cyb√®le, and the brig Vulcain, all four vessels under the overall command of Captain Jean-Marie Renaud. There they engaged a squadron of EIC ships consisting of the East Indiamen , , and , the country ship , the Bombay Marine (EIC) 14-gun brig Nautilus, and two recently captured French privateers, all under the overall command of Commodore Charles Mitchell. (The two privateers were the corvettes Vengeur and R√©solue. On 17 January they had attacked the EIC factory at Bencoolen, where the East Indiaman Pigot had repelled them. Mitchell's squadron encountered the two on 22 January and captured them.) For an hour the two squadrons continued a general exchange of fire at long-range, before Mitchell turned William Pitt, Houghton and Nonsuch towards the French at 09:30, the latter two both managing to hit Cyb√®le with destructive broadsides. Firing continued for another 18 minutes as Renaud withdrew, eventually anchoring off the island of Pulau Baby. Neither commander was keen to continue the action, Mitchell fearing that his undermanned ships would not be able to properly engage the better armed French vessels. Casualties among the French squadron are not known, but the only loss on the British ships was on Nonsuch, which had a man killed in combat with Cyb√®le.James (1837), Vol. 1, p. 199. In need of reinforcement and resupply, Mitchell drew his squadron back to Batavia and was there joined by the 36 gun Dutch frigate Amazone under Captain Kerwal and an armed merchant ship. Mitchell's ships then cruised the Sunda Strait for another two weeks without discovering any enemy vessels, before concluding the operation on 8 February and returning to the Indian Ocean via Bencoolen. Renaud used Mitchell's retreat to withdraw also into the Indian Ocean via Bencoolen. His squadron reached the British trading post on 9 February, where Pigot was still undergoing repairs. The French vessels' arrival took Pigot by surprise and they captured her. As the merchant ship was manoeuvred out of the bay, Renaud demanded the surrender of the small Fort Marlborough nearby and was informed that the fort was well armed and that the arrival of Mitchell's squadron was expected at any moment. Unwilling to reengage with Mitchell, Renaud withdrew immediately without assaulting the fort. The French squadron subsequently returned to √éle de France. Recapture , Captain Newcome, captured Duguay Trouin on 5 May 1794. In the action, Orpheus had a midshipman killed, and nine men wounded. French casualties amounted to 21 men killed and 60 wounded.Demerliac, p.74, no 409 Many of the French crew were ill and Newcome believed that they would not survive the voyage to Madras. Instead, he sailed to Mah√©, Seychelles, where he arrived on 16 May. It was a French possession but it made no resistance when he arrived. Newcome landed 200 sick and wounded prisoners, as well as the rest of Dugay Trouins crew on Ste. Anne Island, from where a brig later carried them to at Port-Louis, Mauritius. Newcome wrote to Malartic, the governor of Mauritius, asking him to release British prisoners equal in number and rank to those Newcome had landed. While it was in the Seychelles, the British squadron also captured the brig Olivette, which belonged to the French privateer Jean- Fran√ßois Hodoul, and Deux Andr√©s, a slaver from Mozambique under the command of Captain Hardy, with 408 slaves on board. On 20 May Newcome sent Olivette to Praslin to gather supplies for the squadron, Newcome left Mah√© on 1 June and arrived at Madras on 18 June, together with Duguay Trouin and Deux Andr√©s. Merchantman and capture On 2 August 1794, it was announced that friends of Captain Reid, of Madras, had purchased Duguay Trouin and appointed him her captain.Houghton, Roger - A Peoples' History 1793 ‚Äì 1844 from the newspapers: Asia 1796 - 1809, Part 2, - accessed 29 December 2014. Duguay Trouin sold for ¬£2900. Her purchasers renamed her Catherine and employed her in the coastal trade.Hackman (2001), p.179. John Reid had left Princess Royal by 4 May 1797. (He shipped on board the country ship Pearl for Bussora and may have died later that year.)Jackson (1799), pp.1, 104, & 108. She made one more voyage for the EIC. At some point Catherine reverted to the name Princess Royal. It is most likely that the name reversion occurred before she left for England. Captain John Wedgborough (or Wedgebrough) left Bombay on 9 August 1797. Princess Royal reached the Cape on 16 October and St Helena on 3 December. She arrived at the Downs on 31 January 1798.British Library: Princess Royal (5). Wedgebrough received a letter of marque on 14 July 1798. Lloyd's List reported in 1800 that a privateer had captured Princess Royal, \\"late Company's ship\\", in November 1799 off the coast of Sumatra.Lloyd's List, no.4040- accessed 6 September 2015. The captor was reported to be the privateer Malartic, of 12 guns.The Asiatic Annual Register: Or a View of the History of Hindustan and of the Politics, Commerce and Literature of Asia, (1801; Cadell and Davies), \\"Chronicle for October 1799\\", p.41. Malartics captain was the noted French privateer Jean-Marie Dutertre. Le Moniteur Universel reported on 2 flor√©al an VIII (22 April 1800) that two privateers had captured Princess Royal and 15 lesser vessels, with a note stating that the 120-man Malartic had alone captured Princess Royal.

The church M√ºnster Allerheiligen is the oldest building in Schaffhausen, and houses also the Museum zu Allerheiligen.  Geography  Today the convent houses the Museum zu Allerheiligen, an art museum and a natural history museum, the monastery garden, and the buildings of the former convent, including the library. The former monastery's building complex is located at the center of the historic old city of the municipality of Schaffhausen in the Canton of Schaffhausen, includes the oldest buildings that still exist in Schaffhausen.  History  grave of the Nellenburg family inside the church the former monastery's garden, as of today a herbal garden The development of the city of Schaffhausen is closely linked to the Nellenburg noble family who became extinct around 1100 AD. Various archaeological finds and the building of the present church of St. Johann (John) date back to around 1000 AD. The Earls (German: Grafen) von Nellenburg recognized the importance of the geographical area as a transshipment of goods on the Rhine river, and the order to bypass the Rheinfall waterfalls, controlled by the W√∂rth Castle. The monastery was founded by Eberhard von Nellenburg in 1049, on 22 November it was consecrated by Pope Leo IX, and in 1064 the construction works were completed. The church was dedicated to the Saviour, the Holy Cross, the Virgin Mary and All the Saints. In 1067 count Eberhard strengthened his rule in Schaffhausen, and received by Pope Alexander II comprehensive protection and sovereign rights for the monastery. Allerheiligen became, instead of the Reichenau Abbey, the new grave lay by the founding family, and various renovations and additions. Eberhard became after 1075 a Benedictine monk in the abbey, and died there in 1078 or 1079. He was buried in the outdoor crypt that was built for the family. In the so-called Investiture Controversy conflict between the Roman Catholic church in Rome and the secular power, the pope loyal Count Burkhard von Nellenburg, the son and heir of Eberhard, conformed in 1080 all of the rights of the monastery. The monastery was directly subordinate to the Pope, and received the vast estate of the family, the free election of the abbot, and the mint money market as well as the town of Schaffhausen. Thus the abbot became the new lord of the city. Burkhard remained the monastery's Vogt, and motivated the Abbot William to join with some monks from the Hirsau Abbey, to reform the monastery on the model of Hirsau. After more than four centuries of economic and political decline, Michael Eggendorfer, the last abbot of the monastery, initiated the last renovations in 1521/22. During the Reformation in Switzerland, the abbey was abolished, and the Cathedral became the second main city church in 1524.  Convent buildings  The first extensions of the abbey included the east wing of the convent building with the chapter house of the monks on the ground floor, and a dormitory with latrines upstairs. In the west, the monastery gate, a two-storey house for guests and lay brothers were added, built around the three-aisled Basilica with a three-apsed choir, a transept and a double tower facade to the west. The westerly courtyard was also built in the foundation era, preceded by a single goal, which was flanked by two chapels. About this door system, there was possibly the entrance to the Nellenburg Palatinate, once the residence of the family. The monastery was modeled on the church buildings of the Cluny Abbey. The monastery consists of a cloister, the garden, the two-winged, two-storey convent buildings and the domestic buildings. In the mid-1460s Abbot Berchtold Wiechser initiated the construction of the Bindhaus (cooperage) over the large wine cellar. In 1521/22 a new convent house with monk cells instead of the old hospital, as well as a Beguine house were built. In 1529 the convent buildings were redeveloped as houses. Twelve years later, the city council moved the municipal cemetery in the former eastern cloister garden. In the winter of 1543, a boys' school was established. The cloister garden was used from 1577 to 1874 as the cemetery for the privileged citizens of Schaffhausen.  M√ºnster Schaffhausen  Eberhard von Nellenburg also financed the monastery's church third central tower to the west, extended with a new chancel choir grown in the apex outdoor crypt, as a burial chamber, and a subsequent courtyard. Around 1090, the church was partially demolished to make place for a larger Cathedral. Late Romanesque expansions were added between 1150 and 1250. Abbot Ullrich initiated the construction of the cathedral tower, the present herb garden, the building of the hospital and the novitiate, as well as a loggia. The St. Johann's chapel was vaulted, and upstairs was a further chapel. The ornately decorated semi-circular arched lunettes of the former upper chapel, are among the finest examples of Romanesque architectural sculpture in the monastery, and are on display in the museum. In 1521/22 the old St. Mary's chapel was rebuilt into the Annakapelle. In addition, the small cemetery chapel in the now Oswaldkapelle, and the abbey's chapel of St. Michael and Erhard were built.

After the Reformation the books were placed in the sacristy of St. Johann. The collection increased by gifts and purchases since 1540, and it was called Bibliotheca publica or Liberey, but still mainly used by the clergy. In 1636 citizens founded the municipal library, geared towards the sciences and arts, the present Stadtbibliothe (city library). In the 18th century two private reading societies re-established the Ministerialbibliothek, being the book collection in the St. Johann church. Since 1923 the city library has been located on the M√ºnsterplatz Square, situated in a building that was built in 1554 as an urban granary. Between 1993 and 1995, the library was remodeled and expanded by an underground magazine, serving also as the cantonal library.  Museum zu Allerheiligen  The building complex was rebuilt between 1921 and 1938 into a museum, to house the great artistic and cultural historical collections, clubs, and private had gathered over decades, to be a place of storage and presentation. The museum exhibited during the first decades in the fields of archeology, history and art, focusing primarily on craft-oriented and categories as chronologically structured tours. An important extension was the integration of natural history collections and the construction of a natural history permanent exhibition. Since then, the museum also hosts regular natural history exhibitions. Its extensive permanent collections and temporary exhibitions, the museum provides a wide variety of topics: Interdisciplinary special exhibitions stimulate discussion with current cultural and scientific themes, as well by the universality of the medieval monastery, the imposing cathedral, the idyllic herb garden and the largest freely accessible cloister of Switzerland. It is operated by financial contribution of the canton of Schaffhausen, foundations, associations and sponsorships.  Facilities  Public transportation is provided by the S-Bahn Z√ºrich line S16 (ZVV), S22 (ZVV) and S33 (ZVV), or in general by SBB railway or Deutsche Bahn DB to Schaffhausen main station. Local bus lines provides the stops Rhybadi/IWC by line 5 and Schiffl√§nde by line 8. The museum is closed on Mondays, usually the museum is open from 11:00 (11 am) to 17:00 (5 pm); after hours visits are available by appointment, as well as guided tours for groups. The monastery's buildings houses the museum, as well as the museum's shop, a restaurant and rooms for seminars. The staff of the museum consists of approximately 25 employees.  Cultural heritage of national importance  The abbey and the library are listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as Class A objects of national importance.

Following the ratification of the first constitution in November 1844, Puello was made governor of the Santo Domingo Province. In the 1845 Haitian invasion, Puello had an important role in the Battle of Estrelleta that forced the Haitian retreat. However, his alignment with the liberals gained him enemies among the conservative-ruled government; the Consul of France, Eustache Juchereau de Saint-Denys, called him a prejudiced against France and an enemy of the whites. The Puello brothers were indicted on charges of instigating an anti- white revolution in the country and ingratitude to the white race; they were judged in absentia. Jos√© Joaqu√≠n and Gabino were sentenced to death by the twenty-five-man jury and executed by a firing squad on 23 December 1847; Eusebio was sentenced to three years in prison and the loss of his military rank (Lieutenant Colonel), however, shortly after he was released and reinstated into the military.

Tuel, 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 324 (1810), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that an assignee of a geographically limited patent right could not bring an action in the assignee's own name. It was the first published Supreme Court decision on patent law.Robert A. Matthews, Jr., 5 Annotated Patent Digest ¬ß 35:1, via Westlaw, retrieved 2014-12-30 (\\"perhaps the first published decision on a patent question by the Supreme Court\\").Malla Pollack, The Owned Public Domain: The Constitutional Right Not to Be Excluded - or the Supreme Court Chose the Right Breakfast Cereal in Kellogg v. National Biscuit Co., 22 Hastings Comm. & Ent L.J. 265, 291 n119 (2000). Like other Supreme Court patent cases prior to Evans v. Eaton, however, it did not deal with substantive patent law, but only with the law of patent assignment.Harold C. Wegner, Post-Merck Experimental Use and the \\"Safe Harbor\\", 15 Fed. Circuit B.J. 1, 37 (2005). Background Remains of a \\"wry fly\\" wheel according to Tyler's invention. On February 20, 1800, the Vermont inventor Benjamin Tyler obtained a patent on a new type of tub wheel, or horizontal water wheel, that he termed the \\"wry fly.\\" Tyler later became better known for his second patent on this basic concept, issued in 1804. Due to the later Patent Office fire, official records of these patents no longer survive. However, the invention was highly influential and anticipated many features of later turbines. Tyler assigned his right and interest in the 1800 patent to others for $6,000, but reserved to himself the right of use and sale within Chittenden, Addison, Rutland, and Windham counties in Vermont. Tyler's assignees brought suit against the defendant Tuel in the District of Vermont for infringing the 1800 patent. They won at trial, but after the verdict was issued, Tuel filed a motion in arrest of judgment, arguing that the assignees never had legal standing to bring the suit, because they were not the assignees of the entire original right and interest in the patent. The district judges were divided on whether to grant the motion or not, and therefore the question went to the Supreme Court on a certificate of division. Opinion of the Court As was common in the patent jurisprudence of the time, the court applied principles of property law to the issue.Adam Mossoff, A Simple Conveyance Rule for Complex Innovation, 44 Tulsa L. Rev. 707, 711-12 (2009). Under section 4 of the Patent Act of 1793,1 Stat. 318, 322. an assignee could bring suit against an infringer but a licensee could not.John F. Duffy, The Festo Decision and the Return of the Supreme Court to the Bar of Patents, 2002 Sup. Ct. Rev. 273, 288 n.51 (2002). Under the common law, an \\"assignment\\" only existed if the entire right and interest was assigned. The court's certified opinion therefore consisted of one sentence: > It is the opinion of the Court that the plaintiffs, by their own showing, > are not legal assignees to maintain this action in their own names, and that > the judgment of the circuit court be arrested.10 U.S. 324, 327. Subsequent developments Tyler has been cited in fewer than a dozen cases since it was written. The Tyler rule was abrogated by the Patent Act of 1836.6 Moy's Walker on Patents ¬ß 18:33 (4th ed.). In consequence, Tyler has seldom been cited since the 1830s, except in historical reviews. In 1868, the Supreme Court noted Tyler's obsolescence in Moore v. Marsh.. The 1836 act, however, only affected geographically divided interests. The Supreme Court therefore continued throughout the 19th century to hold that an assignment that was divided in any non-geographical way was a license rather than an assignment and did not confer standing.Roger D. Blair; Thomas F. Cotter (FNd1), The Elusive Logic of Standing Doctrine in Intellectual Property Law, 74 Tul. L. Rev. 1323, 1337-38 (2000). Under the Tyler rule, an assignee of a geographical part interest could not bring suit in the assignee's own name. Justice Story clarified the Tyler rule in a district court opinion in Whittemore v. Cutter, ruling that Tyler did not apply to the transferee of an undivided part interest.Whittemore v. Cutter, 29 F. Cas. 1120, 1120-21 (C.C.D. Mass. 1813).

The game is set almost entirely on a futuristic aircraft called Zenlil, manned by a crew with chess-themed ranks. The game was principally financed by the Canada Media Fund by awarding a grant for $500,000 CAD in 2010. After a first failed Kickstarter campaign in 2012, $70,435 USD was raised through Kickstarter on April 18, 2013. Consortium was released on January 8, 2014. A sequel, Consortium: The Tower, was released to Steam Early Access on September 21, 2017. Gameplay The game features conversational mechanics which allow gameplay to be uninterrupted by conversations: replies are bound to the function keys and an in-game device allows for semi-telepathic communication. The other major feature is a branching story, similar in execution to the Mass Effect trilogy, and a character alignment system: both of these allow for every playthrough to be different, even to the point of allowing the player to reveal the meta-plot of the game. While the game is a first-person shooter, combat can be entirely avoided, non-lethal or lethal (in a similar style to Deus Ex), and is limited due to the size of the game world. Plot The game is set in the mid-21st century, in a timeline where most world militaries have been disbanded in favour of a technologically advanced world police force called the Consortium. The player assumes control of Bishop 6, an elite Consortium soldier. The game's fiction acknowledges that the player and Bishop 6 are different characters, connected through the interdimensional link of the video game. Non-player characters may not be aware that Bishop 6 is being controlled from afar. During a flight from Bulgaria to Ireland on the aircraft Zenlil, Bishop 6 must deal with hostile mercenaries while trying to uncover the identity of a traitor within the crew. Reception The game received mixed reviews, with a score of 66/100 on reviews aggregation website Metacritic. Reviews praised the storytelling but noted the amount of software bugs in the game. Interdimensional Games sought to address those bugs with the Master Edition patch, released in April 2014. A retrospective at Rock, Paper, Shotgun reflected on the game's fourth wall breaking central conceit, and how it was supported by the conversation and dialogue options. It concluded that \\"None of this would work in another medium.

A substantial, three-storeyed building, it was designed by George Rae, a Brisbane-based architect who designed some of Brisbane's best interwar buildings, and built from 1934 onwards by Douglas Francis Roberts for Mr Sydney James Dove and his wife Audree Thomasina Dove. It was also known as Greystaines Flats. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 May 2006.  History  The land where Greystaines was built, along the southern slope of Hamilton Hill overlooking the Brisbane River and with frontage to the road along the river leading to Eagle Farm was first proclaimed for sale in September 1853. Allotments 6 to 9 of portion 1 (totalling just under ) were acquired by William Robert Howe Weekes. In 1857 access to the area was improved by the construction of a bridge over Breakfast Creek near the confluence with the Brisbane River. From the early 1860s many of the Hamilton allotments were subdivided into smaller parcels, attracting a number of prominent middle-class residents who built comfortable homes on the slopes of Hamilton (later Toorak) and Hemmant (later Eldernell) hills, overlooking the river. Weekes subdivided his land about 1865, creating much of today's pattern of subdivision and roads in the area, including Hillside Crescent, Eden Lane, Crescent Road (originally Weekes Street) and Arran Avenue (originally Robert Street). On the long strip of land at the foot of Hamilton Hill bounded by Hillside Crescent, Eden Lane and Crescent, Hamilton and Toorak roads, two substantial homes had been erected by 1883. \\"Braesid\\" occupied the western third of the site and \\"Norwood\\", the home of Brisbane dentist David Eden from the late 1870s, occupied the eastern two-thirds. The later site of Greystaines formed part of the Norwood Estate. By the mid-1890s a house extant to the east of Norwood, still within the Norwood estate appears to have occupied the later site of Greystaines. In 1906, Eden resurveyed the Norwood estate and sold off the eastern half, with boundaries to Eden's Lane, Hamilton Road and Crescent Road, in two parcels. The site of the flats was transferred to George Longland who occupied a residence at this location from at least 1908. An aerial photograph dated shows a large house on the site. Longland transferred his interest in this property to Jessie Jane Buchanan, as trustee, in 1918 and she transferred the property to Alan Gordon Corrie in 1923. Following Corrie's death in 1925, the property was transferred in late 1928 early 1929 to Sydney James Dove and his wife Audree Thomasina Dove, as joint tenants. In 1934 Mr and Mrs Dove commissioned Brisbane architect George Rae to design a modern block of six brick flats for the site. The site was well chosen for the construction of apartments, offering a number of attractions to potential tenants. The position was high, with extensive views overlooking the Brisbane River and adjacent suburbs; the tram service along Hamilton Road (later Kingsford Smith Drive) provided regular, reliable access to the Brisbane central business district and to inner city attractions such as theatres and restaurants. Two street frontages made for greater convenience of access. Given this prime location in one of Brisbane's premier residential suburbs, the site warranted a substantial, well-designed building that offered apartments of a comfortable size and convenience attracting middle class occupants who could afford a comparatively higher rent. At the time, George Rae was in his early thirties and one of Brisbane's most successful young architects. He had just established his own architectural practice in Brisbane (1933) after working in partnership in this city as Atkinson, Powell and Conrad 1927-31 and Lange L Powell and George Rae 1931-33, both among the most prominent architectural firms of the day. His more substantial purpose- designed aoartment buildings are amongst the most important of their type and their period in Brisbane and include: Carrington (corner of Warry Street and Gregory Terrace, Spring Hill) erected in 1933; Highview (on Dornoch Terrace, Highgate Hill) designed in 1933-34; Casa del Mar (44 Moray Street, New Farm) erected in 1934 and Green Gables (Julius Street Flats New Farm) (corner of Julius and Moray streets, New Farm) erected in 1935. By April 1934 Rae had completed the design Greystaines and was calling tenders for the construction. In mid-1934 the contract was let to well-known Brisbane master builder Douglas Francis Roberts, who resided nearby at Albion. When Brisbane City Council building approval was obtained early in June 1934, the flats were priced at . This represented a substantial investment for a Brisbane apartment building, where most of the better class of brick or concrete apartment buildings of this period cost between $3,000 and $6,000 to construct (exclusive land costs). In mid-1934 Mr and Mrs Dove took out a mortgage on their Hamilton Road property. This possibly financed the construction of Greystaines. Greystaines, 1934 Early in November 1934 the Courier-Mail reported that Greystaines had been completed and published a photograph of the new building. The design was considered very modern and \\"a Colonial adaptation of Mediterranean architectural style\\". The apartments were of a comfortable size, well appointed and finished; clearly intended for middle-class tenants. The building‚Äôs roofs were mottled tiles. When apartments, they had separate garages, two bedrooms, lounge, living room, laundry, kitchen, bathroom and balconies front and back. The interior wall decorations were wallpaper, the bathrooms tiled. Greystaines was erected during a revival of an apartment building \\"boom\\" in Brisbane in the interwar period, curtailed by the severe economic depression of the early 1930s. With the easing of the depression the construction of purpose-built flats led a recovery in Brisbane residential construction from 1933. In 1933-34 apartment buildings reputedly were returning up to 8-12% on capital and were one of the most attractive small investments of the day. Greystaines, constructed in 1934, was one of the first of the larger blocks of residential flats erected in this suburb. In the second half of the 1930s Hamilton became a popular venue for purpose-built apartment construction, rivalling New Farm. Many larger blocks of flats along the southern slopes of Hamilton, Toorak and Eldernell hills from the period 1934‚Äì41 survive. In the 1930s with no provision for strata title of property, the construction of apartment buildingss tended to be a long-term investment for developers, rather than a speculative venture aimed at rapid on-selling. Mr and Mrs Dove retained ownership of Greystaines Flats until the property was transferred to Guy Dart Atherton in July 1941. Ownership changed again in 1950, when sold to Thomas Keith Watson Muir or , who retained the property for nearly 30 years. Around 1950 part of the frontage of the building was resumed to allow widening of the road. It changed hands in 2005 for $2,550,00 and was converted into a single dwelling.  Description  Greystaines is situated on the south east slope of Toorak or Hamilton Hill, fronting Kingsford Smith Drive. It has views of the Brisbane River and across Bulimba, Newstead and the City centre. It had a multi-hipped roof of terracotta tiles. The central bay in the front elevation had a wide gable, below which, on each level, was arcaded verandas with barley twist columns supporting the arches opening onto exposed balconies with balustrades. Either side of the central front bay there were projecting bays with bay windows. Detailing was spare and well executed. Cornices were plain, skirtings simple. There was a wide plate rail in the halls. Doors had full height vertical recessed panels and the drawing rooms on the upper floors had wide doors with multiple rectangular panes of glass set in narrow cames.

She travelled alone through Spain, North Africa, and Indonesia. In the 1970s she published a number of historical works about royalty, two books about cats, and a novel based on the life of Jane Digby. Her greatest commercial success was a series of literary, historical and sociological books about amorous relationships: Love and the French (1959), Love and the English (1960), Love and the Spanish (1961). In various combinations these were translated into French, German and Spanish. All three were reprinted by Penguin Books in 1964‚Äì1965.

She was educated partly in England and partly in France, graduated from the University of Paris, and travelled widely.\\"A Pretty Explorer Will Set Off Again\\", Sunday Herald (Sydney), 5 July 1953.

Its Archeparchial seat is the city of Baalbek, where is the Saint Barbara Cathedral. In 2012 there were 20,000 baptized and its territory is divided into seven parishes. History Baalbek is an ancient seat, already known in the fourth century by the name of Heliopolis of Phoenicia. It has had a presence of Catholic Bishops since 1701, when its bishop sent a profession of the Catholic faith to the Pope in Rome. This profession is still preserved in the archives of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. Baalbek was a suffragan of the Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Damascus until it acquired its autonomy in 1849. The cathedral with the bishop's palace were built during the episcopate of Germanos Mouakkad; the church was consecrated by Eparch Agapitos Malouf in 1897. Bishop Germanos Mouakkad was the founder of the Society of the Missionaries of St. Paul. On November 18, 1964 this eparchy was elevated to the rank of archeparchy.

In the original timeline, Nobita experienced nothing but misery and misfortune manifested in the form of very poor grades and bullying throughout his life. This culminates in the burning down of a future business he sets up which leaves his family line beset with financial problems. In order to alter history and better the Nobi family's fortunes, Sewashi initially wanted to send a super-robot to protect Nobita, but with his meager allowance he could only afford an imperfectly-made factory-rejected toy: an anthropomorphic robot cat called Doraemon. Doraemon was created on 3 September 2112 by the . He has a from which he produces food, money, medicines, and desserts from the future. The 1995 film shows his original appearance; when first created Doraemon had ears and was painted yellow, but he turned blue after sobbing because rats ate his ears. According to 2112: The Birth of Doraemon, he is coated and scented with eggs.2112: The Birth of Doraemon Later on, Disney XD and Fujiko Fujio collaborated to make a TV show for the Japanese icon. The show was called Doraemon: Gadget Cat from the Future. The show's first episode aired on July 7, 2014. The show's last episode aired on September 1, 2015. Doraemon was voiced by Mona Marshall.  In other media  French actor Jean Reno portrayed Doraemon in several live-action television commercials throughout 2011 and 2016. The advertisement's were created by Toyota and depict the series' characters two decades after they \\"grow up.\\" Doraemon appeared at the Tokyo video showcase at the 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in anime form with his fellow anime characters Nobita, Shizuka, Gian, Suneo and other famous Japanese characters such as Captain Tsubasa, Pac-man & Hello Kitty. He later appeared at the video where he helped prime minister Shinz≈ç Abe (dressed up as Mario) by planting a Warp Pipe from Shibuya Crossing to Maracan√£ Stadium.  Reception  In terms of popularity the character has been compared to Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, and the character is considered to be an iconic figure in Japan. The character has received criticism in Chinese media outlets where they considered Doraemon to be a politically subversive character and that it was a tool of Japan's ‚Äúcultural invasion\\". In 2019, a resolution was made in the Pakistan assembly to ban Doremon claiming that it has \\"harmful impact on children\\". In his book Japan Pop: Inside the World of Japanese Popular Culture, author Timothy J. Craig wrote that the character of Doraemon \\"Though Doraemon is himself a high-tech product, he possesses an endearing personality that captivates young audiences. He is both a full member of Nobita's family and an intimate friend to Nobita and his companions. Portrayed in this way, Doraemon represents the optimistic view of the relationship between technology and humanity.\\" In a survey conducted by the Oricon in 2007 among 1,000 people, Doraemon was ranked as the second strongest manga character of all time, behind only Dragon Ball protagonist Son Goku. In 2008 the character of Doraemon was appointed as an \\"anime ambassador\\" to help promote Japanese anime worldwide and in 2013 Doraemon was considered to be the most popular character among Japanese children in a survey held by Video Research Ltd, a position the character had held in the survey since June 2009. On The Wall Street Journal's Japan Real Time, Toko Sekiguchi called it \\"arguably the most beloved cartoon character in Japan\\". Google Japan utilized Doraemon in its Google Doodle for 3 September 2009, in celebration of the character's 40th birthday. In 2012, Hong Kong celebrated the birthday of Doraemon 100 years early with a series of displays of the character. Politician Osamu Fujimura is known as the \\"Doraemon of Nagatacho\\" due to his figure and warm personality. Sumo wrestler Takamisugi was nicknamed \\"Doraemon\\" because of his resemblance to the character. ESP Guitars, have made several Doraemon shaped guitars. During 2014, Doraemon was featured on the cover of all 51 magazines published by Shogakukan.

The royal title Le'iato is second only to King (Tui) of Manu ªa of American Samoa. Tuli Le'iato is the ancestor to many prominent Samoan figures including multimedia activist and award-winning filmmaker Queen Muhammad Ali, and Oregon Duck's Football Linebacker Fotu T. Leiato II.

It was improvised and recorded in a twelve-day period without any overdubbing or repair. It earned generally positive reviews from critics upon release, holding an aggregate of 72 out of 100 on Metacritic. Production Beak was written and recorded between 5‚Äì17 January 2009, improvised live without any overdubbing, at State Of Art Studios in Bristol, England. The reason for the improvised recording was that, according to member Geoff Barrow, \\"We‚Äôve all played on really overdub-y records, but we felt like this wasn‚Äôt about that. We had enough of a sound between the three of us that we didn‚Äôt need to mess around with it.\\" However, in an L.A. Record interview with the entire group, they said there was might've been one tiny overdub, and that was done through discussion. The recording on each day would start at twelve PM, and last until six. Some songs were played ten times, while some others had two or three versions made, but usually the first take was chosen to be featured on the final product. The only tracks that were done in one take were \\"Backwell\\" and \\"Battery Point\\". Barrow said about the lyric writing, \\"I never wrote anything down. And what you hear is what happened in the [recording] room. Non-traditional vocals, really. I‚Äôm not a very lyrical person, and I‚Äôm definitely not a singer. I felt a little weird about it.\\" The album was engineered by Stuart Matthews, and finally mastered by Shawn Joseph at Optimum Mastering. Critical reception Critical reactions of Beak were generally positive, holding an aggregate score of 72 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on ten reviews. A highly favorable review came from Robert Ferguson of Drowned in Sound, who called the album \\"a cohesive, ambitious and thoughtfully-executed murky delight\\" and \\"A godsend of a record in these times of landfill indie\\". Andrew Perry of The Daily Telegraph gave it four out of five stars, writing that \\"Countless bands cite vintage German rock as an influence, but this lot actually sound out-there enough to justify comparison.\\" NME's Ash Dosanjh scored it a seven out of ten, noting \\"a doom- like quality\\" of the record. With a rating of four out of five, Resident Advisor reviewer Michaelangelo Matos praised the krautrock and goth elements as \\"less overly beholden to any one area than it might seem.\\" Ben Hogwood of musicOMH praised the album's variety, describing the LP as \\"a record that gradually gives up its secrets with each listen, in turns sombre, blissful, angry and energetic ‚Äì a record of moods and their transfer to disc\\". Allmusic journalist Heather Phares, in her three-and-a-half star review, opined that \\"at their best BEAK> are fascinatingly dour, and willing to challenge listeners in unexpected ways\\", while BBC Music writer Adam Kennedy found it \\"as eccentrically Bristolian as Aphex Twin‚Äôs works are Cornish or Mogwai‚Äôs are Scottish, with equally intrepid results\\", noting its \\"constant invention and genuine humanity characterising every whirr and warm glow\\". In more mixed reviews, Pitchfork Media's Jess Harvell described Beak \\"as full of odd, compulsive energy as you'd expect from something cranked out in two weeks, made by a guy who probably had creative fuel to burn, considering that his day job took 11 years between their second and third albums\\". Popmatters' Robert McCallum said the album, \\"can at times be a frustrating listen, but a frustrating listen that is certainly not without its fruits, and these fruits can far outweigh the frustration.\\" Ian Crichton of The Skinny opined it as \\"at times a little too familiar and static to fully lose oneself in\\": \\"at first feels exciting and accomplished, until the absolute adherence to well-worn formulas of taut motorik beats, Can basslines and ghost train organ drones begin to dull the edge.\\" Under the Radar writer Nick Hyman called the sounds \\"frequently surprising and refreshing to hear what comes around the dark corners created here\\", although felt the experimental nature went too far at some points of the LP.

Education Lynn was born in Wellington in 1931 and attended Wellington Girls' College from 1945 to 1948. She completed a Diploma of Fine Arts at the School of Fine Arts at Canterbury University College majoring in painting in 1952, and a Diploma of Teaching at Auckland Teachers' Training College in 1954. At art school her lecturers included Rata Lovell- Smith, Bill Sutton and Russell Clark. According to Lynn, the curriculum was focused on the history of Western art, with little attention given to New Zealand or contemporary art, although she did meet artists such as Colin McCahon, Toss Woollaston, Doris Lusk and Rita Angus and see their work in The Group exhibitions. Support for the Women's Art Movement Lynn was one of the first New Zealand artists to address feminist issues in their work, beginning in 1968. She was an active supporter of the women's art movement in New Zealand and in 1983‚Äì84 was involved in setting up the Women's Art Archive. Lynn was featured in a special issue of the New Zealand feminist magazine Broadsheet published in 1983, focused on feminist art. In an interview Lynn discussed how during World War II she had seen both her parents working in jobs, raising their children and sharing family chores. She continued: > There was value placed on women‚Äôs work because it was politically expedient > for it to be so in the early 1940s ... so I had formative years where I was > conditioned to expect equality. But social values changed after the War as > women were required to be wives and mothers again, rather than members of > the paid workforce. A profession and marriage were again presented as > mutually exclusive. Work Lynn worked across a wide range of media, including collages, drawings, paintings, prints, books, sculptures, photographs and installations. In 1972, Lynn spent a year in the United States, where she developed her interest in printmaking; throughout the 1970s she worked with this medium, producing works such as Book of Forty Images (1973‚Äì1974) and Playground,, which explore 'the reasons behind women's social and political oppression'. Between 1977 and 1979, Lynn produced a series of works on paper, now held in the Christchurch Art Gallery, in which she reworked drawings and life studies made at art school, in a comment on 'the sexual politics of the Western art historical tradition'. Lynn is probably best known for her large installation works of the early 1980s. Guarden Gates (1982) (first shown at the Janne Land Gallery, now in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa) is a sculptural installation of seven cyclone-wire mesh gates, woven through with human hair and ribbon. Each piece is titled to reflect cultural stages of a female life: Matrix; Daughter of the father; Sacrifice; Processual ground; Differentiation; Rebirth and Eyes of life, eyes of death. Lynn said, \\"In my hair pieces of 1982 I have come closer to the toxic object image I need. I want a toxic image that physically shocks - the conscious levels are split open - not the safe anchorage.\\" Lynn's contribution to the 1982 Wellington sculpture festival F1 Sculpture Project Mantle, was an installation based around a rectangular construction made up of hair collected over several weeks from local hair salons. Another work using hair, Stain, which gives the illusion of a stream of human hair trickling down the cathedral's marble steps, was installed for the 'New Art in Dunedin' project in 1984. Art historian Priscilla Pitts notes that 'Lynn frequently sought equivalents or proxies for the female body, and this led to a particularly inventive use of materials'. In Guarden Gates, in one work, she set up a frisson by including a small amount of processed animal tissue as a metaphor for the human body. In Lamella/Lamina (1983), a sculptural installation of 15 fragile columns, Lynn used architectural drawing paper processed to create texture, the work itself being installed at Anzart in Hobart in response to threatened rain forest on the Franklin River. The artist said that the columns were, amongst other things, 'a metaphor for vulnerability, sensitivity, and how one toughens up as one gets older ... Lamella/Lamina reflects the layering and interconnectedness, of nature and culture, of skin surface, mind and the political.' Gates of the Goddess ‚Äì a southern crossing attended by the Goddess (1986, first shown at the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery and now in the collection of the Auckland Art Gallery) consists of three large panels, two of which form a passageway for the viewer and the third being a focal point with the form of the goddess. The work brings together many of Lynn's concerns particularly healing the abject as in the 1982 work Mantle. By recovering destroyed and damaged tapa, drawing attention to the low status (craft) assigned to women's production and by analogy to reproduction Lynn creates a work of simple beauty. Between the late 1980s and 2008, Lynn worked with her own DNA imagery in Drawing Connections and her interest in the mind and brain with Rorschach imagery titled Your Mental Set and Mind Field. In 1997 her large installation, showing nine images of her brain, titled Spin: versor versa was shown at City Gallery, Wellington. A survey exhibition of Lynn‚Äôs work titled I, HERE, NOW: Vivian Lynn, curated by Christina Barton, was held at the Adam Art Gallery at Victoria University of Wellington in 2008‚Äì09. Lynn's work is held in public collections throughout New Zealand, including Auckland Art Gallery, the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and Christchurch Art Gallery.

It appeared as the 1966 Brown & Bigelow Boy Scout Calendar. Long-time Rockwell model James Edgerton and his son are depicted as a Scout moving through the stages of a man's Scouting career. Creation The Edgerton family lived next to Norman Rockwell for 10 years. During that time, four generations of Edgertons posed for Rockwell. The first time that James \\"Buddy\\" Edgerton posed for Rockwell was for the 1945 Boy Scout Calendar illustration, I Will Do My Best, in 1943. The final time was for Growth of a Leader, after Rockwell moved from Arlington, Vermont, to Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Of the four men depicted, three were modeled after Buddy and the fourth, the Cub Scout, was modeled after his son. Since no one in the Edgerton family was involved in Scouting, all of the uniforms were borrowed from friends. Composition The painting depicts the stages a man goes through as he moves through the Scouting program, in front of an American flag. The cycle starts with a young Cub Scout. As the boy becomes older he moves to the Boy Scout and then the Sea Scout/Explorer (modern day Venturing) programs. The Sea Scout has an Eagle Scout pin on his uniform. Finally, the man, with flecks of gray in his temples, becomes a Scoutmaster. Each of the figures is looking at a single point off of the canvasing, giving them the feeling of being united in a single purpose. Meaning The painting represents the increase in maturity a Scout gains as he goes through the program. This is shown by the physical changes to each of the figures and by the change in expression on each of their faces.

History The base was located on the peak of S∆°n Tr√† Mountain, overlooking Danang Harbour and China Beach In 1962, the U.S. Navy Officer in Charge of Construction directed the American construction contractor RMK-BRJ to build a new Air Control Radar Station atop the north peak of the mountain, including 12 buildings at the bottom of the mountain and 11 buildings atop the mountain, as well as the road up the mountain to the north peak. In May 1965, Navy Seabees from Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Three (NMCB 3) started work on a very difficult job to construct a road from the north peak to the south peak of Monkey Mountain, and then construct a U.S. Marine Light Anti-Aircraft Missile battery (LAAM) atop the peak. The south peak originally was the size of a desk, but the top was removed through explosives to provide 15 to 20 acres of space for the missile battery, shops, and living spaces. NMCB-3 was relieved mid-way through construction by NMCB-9. The USAF Detachment 2, 6925th Security Group established a signals intelligence (SIGINT) base on the mountain in 1962 to intercept North Vietnamese HF and VHF communications. The USAF 620th Tactical Control Squadron established a Control and Reporting Center (CRC) Call Sign Panama on the mountain in 1964 to control fighters operating in I Corps. Most of the fighters came from Da Nang Air Base or Phu Cat Air Base. On 14 February 1965 the Marine 1st LAAM Battalion established its anti-aircraft operations center colocated with the USAF CRP. The MIM-23 Hawk missiles of A Battery, 1st LAAM Battalion were also deployed on the mountain approximately 5 km south of the CRP. The USAF retained overall control of air defense around Danang and the CRC controlled when and if the Marine Hawk missiles could be fired. In August 1965 the 9th Marines assumed responsibility for the defense of the Monkey Mountain area. On 26 October 1965 two F-4B Phantoms of VMFA-115 returning to Danang Air Base from a mission crashed into the side of Monkey Mountain killing all four crewmembers. In late 1966 the USAF established a new tactical air control - north center (TACC-NS) at the base which controlled all air operations over North Vietnam. In July 1967 Marine Air Control Squadron 4 (MACS-4) established a new Marine Tactical Data System (MTDS) and Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC) allowing for the control of up to 200 aircraft at once and a direct link to the Seventh Fleet's Naval Tactical Data System. On 24 March 1968 an F-8 Crusader Bu 150306 from VF-53 crashed into the side of Monkey Mountain, the pilot ejected successfully and the rear fuselage of the jet which embedded in the mountain became a popular photo opportunity for military personnel. In July 1969 the 1st LAAM Battalion was withdrawn from Vietnam. In February 1971 MACS-4 was withdrawn from Vietnam, however 20 Marines from the Squadron remained at Monkey Mountain to man the Marine Tactical Data Communications Center (TDCC), an automated facility which linked the Air Force and Navy aircraft tracking systems and antiair warfare direction. In March 1971 the USAF SIGINT facility was closed and its operations were moved to Thailand. Current use The base has largely reverted to jungle although a modern radio tower has been built at the site.

Assassinations are performed by tapping the Action button when a nearby guard has the Hidden Blade icon over his head. During combat, players can attack, block attacks, use skills, or exit the fight. However, some skills cannot be used in combat, and exiting fights has a cooldown. The Assassin starts off at the Anonymous status, in which normal guards ignore him. If the Assassin manages to break hostile guards' lines of sight or is doing suspicious acts, the Assassin enters Alerted status, in which normal guards watch the Assassin closely, but do not do anything. During fights or when running from hostile guards, the Assassin is in Wanted status, in which all guards attack the Assassin on sight. Assassins can lower statuses by either breaking hostile guards' lines of sight for an extended period of time or by blending. However, the Assassin will always be attacked on sight in Restricted Areas, and by some Templar enemies. During combat, the player can also summon hirelings, which depending on class, have a skill and passive upgrade. However, if the player uses the hireling's skill, the hireling can no longer be used for the mission, and passive upgrade is nullified. Players can also use the iconic Eagle Vision and Leap of Faith during missions. Missions There are several types of missions. Campaign missions advance the storyline, and often have multiple parts (or multiple objectives), as well as side objectives. Campaign missions have objectives like Tail, Escort, Assassinate, and Courier, and side objectives are often assassinate special units, complete the objectives within a certain time limit, and more. Campaign missions give items, XP, and coins. Contract missions are side missions with a single objective, with objectives like Tail, Escort, Assassinate, Courier, Pursuit, Pillage, Recovery, and more. Contract missions give items, XP, and coins. Initiate and higher level Contract missions also give Tokens. Plot In Italy, an Assassin is patrolling Monteriggioni when he spots a group of Borgia mercenaries disguised as tax collectors. Although the Assassin kills all of the mercenaries, a thief escapes with the contents of a chest belonging to the Assassins. The thief is revealed to be Pietro de Galencia, a Borgia Agent working undercover in Monteriggioni. Pietro had captured an old man, who was the father of a Roman Assassin, and tortured him into revealing one of the secret entrances into Villa Auditore, which led Pietro to the chest. After the theft, the old man escapes and warns the citizens of Monteriggioni about Pietro's betrayal. The Assassin then hunts down and kills Pietro. However, when investigating Pietro's house, the Assassins can only find letters from Cesare Borgia, Captain General of the Papal Forces and leader of the Templars. Soon after, rumors begin circulating about mysterious men wearing black- feathered armor massacring people for sport. Afterwards, Leonardo da Vinci, an inventor and ally of the Assassins, suspects he is being followed and calls an Assassin stationed in Firenze. While escorting Leonardo, the Assassin senses danger and uses his Eagle Vision to find a man disguised as a civilian. The man was wearing black armor decorated with crow feathers. The Assassin kills the man and hurries toward the Assassin hideout with Leonardo, but are constantly stopped by Medici Guards, who were allegedly asked to arrest Leonardo. The Assassin manages to escort Leonardo to safety, but even more reports on the black armored men begin to circulate, describing them as having uniforms filled with crow feathers, a fighting style exactly like the Assassins', and using a modified version of the Hidden Blade. Later, an Assassin scout visits Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, an Assassin. The scout had been exploring a set of catacombs and found a tunnel blocked by grates. The scout saw several scrolls and manuscripts, but also saw a small chest with the Assassins' mark on it. Machiavelli then sends the scout, along with three Assassin apprentices, to retrieve the chest. However, after they fail to return, Machiavelli sends a scout to investigate. The scout tells Machiavelli that the Assassins were captured and killed by a group of Borgia Agents and their men. Infuriated, Machiavelli summons a veteran Assassin and tasks him to hunt down the Agents and recover the fallen Assassins' belongings. The Assassin retrieves the chest and kills the Agents before returning to Machiavelli with the chest. After examining the chest, Machiavelli discovers it was the chest Pietro de Galencia had stolen from Villa Auditore. The chest contained a modified copy of the original Hidden Blade blueprints, with a crow's head carved in the blade. Machiavelli then deduces that someone has successfully replicated the Hidden Blades. After a while, Machiavelli receives a short, mysterious letter from a man named Demetrio, who plans to murder Cesare Borgia during the night. In the letter, Demetrio requests Assassins to escort him to safety after the murder. Machiavelli and an Assassin wait for a night to no avail when they see Cesare Borgia commanding his guards to execute a man. The Assassin points out that the man to be executed is Demetrio, a blacksmith working for Cesare Borgia. The Assassin manages to rescue Demetrio and escort him to safety. Demetrio tells Machiavelli that after he refused Cesare's order to replicate even more Hidden Blades, he was tortured. Demetrio then tried to murder Cesare many times, but failed each time. When Machiavelli shows Demetrio the modified Hidden Blade blueprint from the stolen chest, Demetrio confirms that he was the one who made them, and calls them the Corvix Blades. Demetrio then reveals information on Cesare Borgia and the men with the crow feathers. Demetrio explains that after realizing that his guards cannot use the Corvix Blades, Cesare decides to make his own Assassins. Cesare finds a group of young men in an orphanage and sends them to Vallombrosa, an abbey near Firenze. He then uses his contacts to trick a Spanish Assassin named Raphael S√°nchez into training the men by making Raphael believe that it was the Assassin's Brotherhood that contact him. After the training is complete, Cesare sends a bald man to Vallombrosa. The bald man claims that Raphael's task is complete and that he needs to return to Spain immediately. After the confused Raphael leaves, the bald man calls the young men \\"The Crows\\". One day, Assassin scouts tell Machiavelli that something unusual was happening at the Borgia camp next to the Colosseum. Machiavelli sends an Assassin to investigate. The Assassin finds a huge load of weapons arriving from Firenze and opens one of the crates, which he discovers is filled with Corvix Blades. The Assassin then infiltrates the camp, which he discovers is full of members of The Crows. He then uses Eagle Vision and spots an ex-Borgia captain named Matteo conversing with a bald man. The Assassin eavesdrops on their conversation before tailing Matteo to the top of the Colosseum. After a brief fight, the Assassin kills Matteo. After the Crows leave the camp, Assassin scouts follow the Crows and find the bald man who had been talking to Matteo. His name was Sirus Favero, a weapons merchant from which Cesare was ordering special weapons. Sirus swears that he had no knowledge what the crates contained and agreed to help the Assassins against the Borgias. Sirus then proves to be a useful ally, as he provides the Assassins with information on Cesare's activities. He also gives Machiavelli a device used by Cesare's scribes to decrypt the messages used by Cesare's scribes and the Crows. Machiavelli then decides to chase one of Cesare's men, a bookkeeper running a ledger containing detailed information on Cesare's plans. Machiavelli sends an Assassin, who follows the bookkeeper to his hideout and steals the ledger. While reading the ledger, Machiavelli discovers the existence of Il Corvo, the Grandmaster of the Crows It also revealed that there was a Crow hideout in Rome, and that the Crows were planning something involving the nobles. Sirus then insists on staying in Rome, where he would intercept Crow messengers. A few months later, Sirus sends a letter saying he knows where Il Corvo is hiding, and requests an Assassin to help him gather more information. The Assassin arrives in Rome and, on Sirus's command, kills a Crow messenger and brings his letter to Sirus. Sirus then tells the Assassin to hide until he finds exactly where the Crows are. However, the Assassin happened to be the one who witnessed Sirus talk to Matteo at the Colosseum, and the Assassin decides to follow Sirus. While following Sirus, the Assassin is ambushed by several Crow Leaders. After realizing the Crows are losing, Sirus shouts, \\"My Crows will do to you exactly the same as what you did to my son! You and all your brothers will pay with blood!\\" before disappearing. Machiavelli then realizes that Sirus is actually Il Corvo. Later, Machiavelli is visited by Father Pio, a friend of his, who complains about a group of people with the Borgia seal locking down the courtyard of the Santa Croce Cathedral. Machiavelli then sends an Assassin to investigate. After learning that there was a Crow messenger in Firenze, the Assassin identifies the messenger and kills a Templar Agent in the cathedral courtyard, causing chaos. With the messenger kept from entering until the chaos settled, the Assassin uses a fake letter and persuades the terrified messenger to switch the letters. The Assassin then brings the letter to Machiavelli, who realizes that Il Corvo is calling all of the Crows to Rome to kill the Assassins. Machiavelli then rushes to Rome, where he summons an Assassin to help him find Il Corvo's hideout. After identifying the hideout, the two witness a large group of Crows on the street. Suggesting that Il Corvo had set a trap, the Assassin escorts Machiavelli to a nearby bridge before killing Il Corvo and his bodyguards. He then rejoins Machiavelli, and they search Il Corvo's hideout. They find a piece of paper with the painting of a cube on it. They also find a small chest, which contains a small shard. While investigating the letters, Machiavelli reads a letter on how an object called the Crystal Cube was important to the Templars. He also deduces that even Cesare hated Il Corvo. A few months later, one of Machiavelli's spies reports that The Crows had committed a string of ruthless murders in Forl√≠. After receiving the letter, Machiavelli is visited by Ezio Auditore, who possessed an artifact with supposedly magical powers. They decide to give it to Caterina Sforza, Countess of Forl√≠. Machiavelli then sends a message to his spy, asking him to meet him in Forl√≠. Machiavelli is escorted by an Assassin to meet the spy. While meeting with the spy, Machiavelli is ambushed by several Crows, who the Assassin fights off. Machiavelli then decides to eliminate the Crows. Machiavelli asks the Assassin to track down the Crows and kill them. The Assassin identifies an undercover Crow and follows him to a Crow meeting, where he kills all of the Crows. After the Assassin kills the Crows, Caterina Sforza and Machiavelli are told that the Borgia were attacking Forl√≠. During the attack, several of Machiavelli's spies are captured. However, the Assassin manages to free most of them before they are executed. Machiavelli then decides to watch the attack from a tower. However, he is hit by an arrow, which knocks him into the moat. Borgia guards then capture him and bring him to a small church outside of the city. However, one of Machiavelli's spies witnesses Machiavelli's capture and informs Ezio, who promptly informs the Assassin. While Ezio distracts the guards, the Assassin frees Machiavelli. Later, Machiavelli expresses his opinion that all of the remaining Crows were killed or scattered during the attack on the city.

It was built from to 1915. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 March 1994.  History  James Robert Dickson and family outside Toorak House, circa 1872 This two storeyed stone residence was erected at Breakfast Creek for Brisbane businessman James Robert Dickson. Dickson appeared to be living at Breakfast Creek by March 1865, and references to the Dicksons at Toorak appear later that year. Dickson arrived in Brisbane in 1862, and was in business with Arthur Martin as an auctioneer and land agent until August 1864 when the partnership was dissolved. Martin continued business under his own name, and Dickson formed a new partnership with James Duncan, as general auctioneers and land and commission agents. The firms of A Martin and Dickson and Duncan appear to have been responsible for much of the land subdivision and sales in Brisbane during the mid-late 1860s. Dickson entered the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1873 as the Member for Enoggera, and held various offices until he resigned in 1887. After failing to regain a seat in the 1888 colonial election, Dickson did not re-enter politics until 1892 when he won the seat of Bulimba. Dickson became Queensland Premier in October 1898, holding this position until December 1899. A strong advocate of Federation, Dickson was a member of the Australian delegation to England for the passage of the Commonwealth bill through the Imperial parliament. Dickson was a member of the first Federal Parliament and appointed the first Commonwealth Minister of Defence. Dickson was involved also in various companies including the Royal Bank of Queensland, the Brisbane Permanent Building and Banking Society, Queensland Trustees and the Queensland Insurance and Land Mortgage Company. Knighted on the day of Federation, he died 10 days later. William Robert Howe Weekes of Brisbane was granted almost 32 acres of land in 1864. This land included four (4) allotments in the Parish of Toombul, fronting the Brisbane River. Subdivision of this land appeared to commence the following year when Dickson acquired part of the land. By 1873, an area of just under ten (10) acres of land, which included Toorak and grounds, had been transferred into Annie Dickson's name (Dickson's wife). Following Annie's death in 1880, the land was held by Dickson, as trustee. Toorak was built of stone reputedly from the nearby Petrie quarries at Albion. The design and name of Toorak are believed to have been derived from a house at Toorak in Melbourne designed by a cousin of Dickson. The design of Toorak reflects the influence of the English Picturesque movement on Australian domestic architecture of the late nineteenth century. Toorak House, circa 1890 A photograph of Toorak taken shows that the house was originally single storeyed with a two level entry hall protruding through the verandah roof. The second storey appears to have been added by the 1890s. An upper section was added to the tower by the 1890s. Dickson, accompanied by four of his daughters, travelled to Europe in early 1890, returning to Brisbane in late 1891. It is believed that while Dickson was overseas, he acquired the two marble lions which stand at the entrance of Toorak, and that he hired Italian artists to undertake decorative work inside Toorak. Following Dickson's death in 1901, the land was transferred to Power and Agnes Dickson (two of his children) as trustees. By this time, Toorak stood on an area of just over four (4) acres. Toorak was leased by Eton High School (later St Margaret's Anglican Girls' School) run by the Sisters of Sacred Advent in 1907. Although Toorak was regarded as an ideal healthy environment for boarders, it was considered to be \\"too great a climb for day pupils\\", and the Sisters moved the school to Donatello . Additions to Toorak were undertaken by Richard Gailey in 1915. Toorak was acquired by grazier George Moffatt in 1916, and then in 1929 by John Gibson of the pioneer sugar family. Subsequent owners were Brisbane businessman Patrick Woulfe, prominent grazier, philanthropist and art collector Harold de Vahl Rubin, and pastoralist Sir William Allen in 1963. Since Allen's death in 1977 Toorak has remained in the Allen family, and stands on an area of .  Description  The building undergoing renovations, 2015 Toorak House is a substantial, Gothic-influenced, two storeyed sandstone residence with richly decorated interiors. It has steeply pitched shingle roofs and a single storeyed brick and corrugated iron wing attached to the rear. The house is impressively set within gardens containing mature trees and manicured garden beds, and sits on the crest of Hamilton Hill, commanding extensive views. The south, principal elevation has a strong formal presence, with a castellated square tower rising above the roofline flanked by two tall bay windows and steeply pitched dormer windows. The ground floor has a U-shaped timber verandah with a corrugated iron roof which has been enclosed with flyscreen to the west and glazing to the east. The main entrance comprises a flight of stone stairs guarded by a pair of lifesize marble lions, leading to an arched opening at the foot of the tower. The marble landing is inset with the word TOORAK. The east and west elevations of the sandstone house comprise two gables with tall bay windows; the southern gabled bays step out to align with the external face of the verandah. The first floor has small balconies with timber balustrades braced in diagonal patterns. The house has timber sash windows and French doors. The sandstone house has decorative external detailing in stone and timber trim. The square-snecked rubble stonework is dressed with projecting quoins, keystones, toothed windows surrounds and string courses and the tower has an arched cornice. The roofs are decorated with scalloped barge boards, finials, and carved eaves brackets. The verandah has chamfered timber posts and ornamental timber valances. The internal layout comprises four substantial and two smaller rooms either side of a central corridor on the ground floor, and four large and two small bedrooms on the upper floor. The entrance hall has frescos on the walls and ceilings, and is divided with a decorative arch. The rooms throughout the ground floor contain marble chimney breasts and rich plaster work and cornices. The joinery appears to be primarily cedar. Timber stairs with carved newels located at the end of the corridor give access both to upstairs rooms and a sheeted storage area at half-landing level via coloured glass doors. The ceilings throughout the upper level are half-raked and follow the lines of the roofs. The floor level steps up toward the south, accommodating higher ceilings below. The principal rooms have dormer windows expressed in the ceilings, French doors glazed in geometric patterns opening onto small balconies, and circular timber ceiling roses. A small room at the end of the corridor contains narrow timber stairs leading to a platform at the top of the tower. This vantage point offers 360¬∞ views of Brisbane and surrounds. The rear wing is a modest structure in Flemish bond brickwork, with timber windows and louvred French doors opening onto a verandah to the east. The building has been extended and modified to the north east, north west and west. It consists of a kitchen, several bedrooms and an office, also accessed from a central corridor. The corridor and the rooms to the west have flagstone floors, while the rooms to the east have timber floors. The western rooms have been extensively refurbished, while the eastern rooms retain their timber boarded and pressed metal ceilings. The gardens provide a picturesque setting for the house. To the south, an oval rose garden encircled by an oval drive reinforces the formality of the front facade. The eastern garden is terraced, and the northern garden has lawn, a mature hedge and a brick outhouse with a convex corrugated iron roof. The grounds contain many substantial and mature trees, including mature palms, camphor laurels, jacarandas, liquidambars, and Moreton Bay chestnuts.

It was built from 1860s to 1920s. It is also known as Balmoral, Langley Grove, and Runnymeade. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 May 1999.  History  Lochiel comprises a substantial timber and masonry residence together with associated outbuildings (the former stables, shed, and lych gate) set within substantial grounds on the lower reaches of Toorak Hill overlooking the Hamilton Reach of the Brisbane River. The house has evolved over several stages: its genesis is believed to be a two-story masonry house erected by John Francis Buckland in the 1860s. After the house was purchased by John Samuel Cameron (the younger) in 1899 two timber additions were undertaken: a museum wing by 1906 and a first floor addition over the eastern wing by 1927. The layout of the garden is also believed to date from Cameron's ownership. Lochiel remains in the ownership of the Cameron family; the house having been converted into flats after World War II. This history is based entirely on publicly held records. It is believed that further information is held by the Cameron family, which may well contribute further to its understanding. The land on which Lochiel stands forms part of an original deed of grant of (described as allotment 5 of portion 1) made in April 1855 to John James Perry and William Anthony Brown both of Brisbane. It is not known whether the land was occupied at this time, however Nehemiah Bartley writing in 1854 describes a foot track over Toorak Hill (then called Gage's Hill) to German Station at Nundah so avoiding the longer route by the river bank. Prior to 1845 squatting licences were known to have been granted in this vicinity (including to Gage who cleared land, and planted maize and vegetables). On the other side of Breakfast Creek, just three years after the declaration of free settlement and the first Brisbane land sales, land was offered for sale including the Newstead House, Brisbane parcel (house erected 1845/6). The value of the Breakfast Creek / Hamilton district had been recognised from the earliest settlement of Brisbane. In 1824, prior to the resiting of the Moreton Bay penal colony from Redcliffe to Brisbane, it was Breakfast Creek which was nominated by Governor Brisbane and John Oxley as a more suitable place for settlement with the rocky point now known as Cameron Rocks identified as having good anchorage and a natural wharf. The first known settlement in the district however came with the establishment in 1829 of Eagle Farm as an annexe to the penal colony. The construction of the Eagle Farm Road by convicts (later also called Breakfast Creek Road and Hamilton Road, now Kingsford Smith Drive) and a bridge across Breakfast Creek later providing impetus for the early development of the area. In 1865 allotment 5 was transferred to Peter Nicol Russell described on the title as of London but according to electoral records resident at New Farm. In the same year this was subdivided into 15 lots. An 1864 advertisement for sale of nearby lands describes the area along the Eagle Farm Road as \\"at all times the most favourite direction for suburban residence, it has of late been even more enquired after for similar purposes ... Very great improvements have attended the progress of this locality during the last twelve months\\". According to title's information, on 21 September 1867 (but possibly some two years earlier), three of the subdivided parcels of allotment 5 (subs 11, 12, and 13) containing were transferred to Ellen Gertrude Buckland. EG Buckland (?-1911) was the wife of John Francis Buckland (1832-1910). JF Buckland arrived in Queensland in 1862 from England establishing an auctioneering partnership with Simon Fraser (Fraser & Buckland 1863-1873); later in business on his own account as an auctioneer and broker. He was an original member of the Nundah Divisional Board (created 1880/1) until 1883 when he became the first Chairman of the new Toombul Divisional Board of which he remained a member until the late 1880s when, with the creation of the new Hamilton Divisional Board, he no longer resided within the boundaries of Toombul. From 1882 to 1892 he was the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Bulimba. The first Post Office Directories (1868) record Buckland as residing at Breakfast Creek (which the area was known as). Based on a combination of the Post Office Directories and photographic evidence, it is the Bucklands who are believed to have erected what was to become the first stage of Lochiel. A photograph dated 1868 shows the house at this stage believed to have comprised 2 rooms upstairs with kitchen area below fronting what is now known as Hillside Crescent. No architect or builder has to date been identified although in 1864 Brisbane architect WH Chambers erected the Queen Street premises of Fraser and Buckland. During the Buckland's residency the house appears to have been known firstly as Balmoral Cottage and from 1885 to 1886 as Runnymeade. The Bucklands' Toorak Hill neighbours at this time included several substantial residences: James Dickson's \\"Toorak\\" (Toorak House) erected , \\"Eldernell\\" (1869), \\"Waterview\\" (later 'Camden House'; demolished), and \\"Mt Pleasant\\" (on the western side of Toorak Rd). In 1889 a further was added to the Runnymeade holding with resubs 11-16 of subs 6, 7, and 8 (with frontage to Dickson Terrace) being acquired again in the name of Ellen Gertrude Buckland. (This land is no longer part of the Lochiel holding and does not form part of the entry in the Heritage Register). A photograph dating from this time shows Runneymede as a masonry house in cottage orne style comprising a simple gabled front section with verandahs facing south and a gabled brick wing to the northeast, which has apparently been added by this time. The house and extension have distinctive bargeboards with wavy edges. The photograph also shows a roof in the location of the existing small shed located to the east of the house and a mature garden. In the same year the Bucklands acquired a near neighbour to the east when Kate Quinlan erected \\"Maria Ville\\" (later called 'Eltham'). In 1892, Buckland became insolvent although according to the Post Office Directories he remained at Runnymeade until the mid-1890s. From 1895 to 1897 the house is listed as vacant, but was apparently occupied for a short time thereafter by Fred Lawson (of Lawson and Johnson fancy goods dealers) and renamed Langley Grove. In 1899 the property was transferred by the mortgagee to John Samuel Cameron who renamed the house Lochiel. Cameron (1868-1917), son of John Samuel Cameron (1834-1902) and Frances Spencer Cameron was a partner in the Brisbane auctioneering firm established by his father, (John Cameron & Sons, which remains a family firm). JS Cameron Snr and his family are believed to have resided nearby to Lochiel (then Runnymeade) in the 1880s at Greenbank. In 1884 the family moved to Doowabah at Ormiston. In a manuscript held by the John Oxley Library, one of John Samuel Cameron's three sisters recalls that the Camerons were very keen gardeners, and with the help of John Neish, the Scottish gardener Captain Hope of Ormiston House Estate had brought out with him, we soon had a wonderful flower and fruit garden which was greatly helped by the many sharks that were buried for fertilising purposes. In 1900 John Cameron jnr married Etty Florence Griffiths Higgins. The Lochiel household also included Marian Griffiths Higgins (later Brown; Etty's daughter from her first marriage to Ernest Higgins) and two sons John Griffiths Cameron (born 1903) and Stuart Francis Griffiths Cameron (b1904). Photographs show the house and grounds prior to the erection of the museum . The studio photographs which appear to be contemporaneous are taken from the south east and north east. They show the house prior to the enclosing of the verandahs as well as a good view of the eastern wing of the house (including a small separately roofed timber addition) prior to the addition of the upper story. The roofed area to the rear of the house is also shown. Garden structures including post and rail fences, trellises and a small building on the eastern boundary are visible. According to his sister Cameron was a keen collector, when young of Shells and Birds' Eggs and Native Weapons of all sorts but later became very interested in good China and Glass, particularly Bohemian and Venetian Glass, and his large collection contained many very beautiful specimens. Apparently to house his collection, by 1906, Cameron had added the museum to the western side of the house. Built of timber, the museum interior is shown in photographs as having decorative tie beams and hangers, high level windows, and a striped timber floor. The collection appears to have been highly personal and eclectic with aboriginal artefacts, oriental furniture, porcelain paintings, and sculptures filling the space. The purpose built museum is believed to be rare. To date only one other purpose built private museum has been identified: at \\"Beaufort Hill\\" Clayfield where in the 1920s Edward Hawkins had a museum room incorporated as part of a tower addition to an existing house. By 1906 the lychgate at the corner of Toorak Road and Hillside Crescent had also been erected. By this time Hamilton was well established as a suburb of Brisbane. In 1899 the electric tram service to Ascot commenced; subdivisions continued including that of the nearby Toorak Estate (following the death of James Dixon in 1901); in 1904 the town of Hamilton succeeded the Shire of Hamilton as the local authority area; and \\"the Rocky Wharf\\" (later called Cameron Rocks apparently in honour of JS Cameron), once described as the perfect landing place for a fledgling penal colony, was now a place for couples to \\"spoon\\" away the evening hours. A contemporary newspaper article describes the Hamilton township: \\"The mansions and villas of many of Brisbane's commercial men crown every green knoll, inviting the cool breezes of the eastern ocean ... Hamilton Road is a well-kept thoroughfare, and provides a much frequented drive, whilst the electric tramcars which traverse it are invariably filled on summer afternoons and evenings ... At the present time there are about 5,000 souls resident in Hamilton.\\" In 1916 Cameron appointed his brothers Waverley Fletcher Cameron, Stuart William Cameron, and his wife Etty Florence Cameron as trustees. They remained as trustees administering his estate after his death in the following year on 26 April 1917. Under the terms of Cameron's will, his wife continued to reside at Lochiel (including the enjoyment of the museum) until her death in August 1945 when Lochiel passed to their two sons. The Brisbane City Council Sewerage Detail Plan records that by 1927 an upper story had been added to Lochiel positioned over the early brick eastern wing, although based on photographic evidence this may have been as early as 1912. An undated photograph shows Lochiel after this addition which was detailed to match the museum wing. To date it has not been possible to identify who was responsible for this work. Based on drawings prepared by architects Job & Collins the upper floor was accessed by an internal stairwell from the existing eastern wing of the house. The 1927 sewerage plan shows Lochiel much as it is today although at this time the land holding still extended through to Dickson Terrace. The plan shows the small shed, garages (believed to be former stables) to the north west of the site, lychgate, and several other unidentified structures. In the 1930s half of the land holding (fronting Dickson Terrace) was reconfigured into three blocks ‚Äì subs 1 and 2 with frontage to Dickson Terrace; sub 3 with a narrow frontage to Toorak Road. None of these blocks were sold but remained (as required by Cameron's will) as part of the administered estate of John Samuel Cameron although sub 1 was leased from 1936 to one of the Cameron sons, John Griffiths Cameron. A house may have been erected on this site at this time. Following the death of Etty Florence Cameron in 1945, her two sons inherited the property as provided for under their father's will. At this time the contents of the museum were apparently dispersed and architects Job & Collins prepared drawings for the conversion of the house into flats. One drawing also shows the pre-flat layout of the ground floor: the early masonry core of the house contains the dining room and a bedroom; the eastern wing, a bedroom, stairwell to upper level, maid's room (in the timber portion), and bathroom on the verandah; to the rear of the house is the living room with stairs to basement level marked; kitchen, scullery, and associated service rooms to the west of the living room; the museum is shown with several entrances marked to other parts of the house. It is not known what use if any was made of the basement rooms (which in addition to the original kitchen rooms also includes a room under the museum). The second drawing documents the conversion of the house into the 6 existing flats. From 1947, the two Dickson Terrace blocks are separated from the main house block subs 11,12, and 13 and sub 3 (containing the house Lochiel) ‚Äì each son acquiring a block with the house block being held in joint ownership. After the death of Stuart Cameron in 1972, the whole of what is now considered the Lochiel house block is acquired by John Griffiths Cameron. Lochiel was acquired by the present owners following the death of their father in 1976. A 1997 application for demolition which was refused by the Brisbane City Council attracted a considerable number of objections. Lochiel remains on the market. A feasibility study for its reuse commissioned on behalf of the Queensland Heritage Council in 1998 has identified several potential uses. In 2001, Michelle Kleist restored the mansion in 2001 but argued with the Queensland Heritage Council over a number of aspects of the restoration, including its colour. She followed the directions of the Council and later said she was happy with that outcome. In June 2006, the real estate information service RPD bought Lochiel for $6.4 million. In October 2010, the company and its founder Raymond David Catelan were fined $250,000 and $100,000 respectively for conducting unauthorised building work on Lochiel, involving the removal of walls and foundations and widening the cellar.  Description  Street entrance gate, 2015 Lochiel is a two-storeyed with basement timber structure with a masonry core and a corrugated iron gable roof. It is located on the northeastern corner of Toorak Road and Hillside Crescent, on the south facing slope of Toorak Hill overlooking the Hamilton Reach of the Brisbane River to the south. Lochiel has substantial gardens/plantings, and ancillary structures including garages (former stables), shed, and lych gate. Lochiel was constructed as a private residence and underwent two major extensions before its conversion into six flats. The earliest section of the building consisted of the existing masonry core, which comprises a south facing wing with basement rooms, and a wing at the rear forming an L-shaped plan. A large timber \\"museum\\" wing was added to the western end of the building forming a U-shaped plan. This wing is high-set with a recessed masonry enclosed room below. The rear wing was extended to the north and a second storey added, and later the courtyard space at the rear was enclosed. The building was subsequently converted into flats. The main entrance to Lochiel, when still a single residence, was from the south fronting Hillside Crescent. The southern elevation is high-set and consists of the \\"museum\\" wing at the western end, with an enclosed verandah with a corrugated iron skillion roof and brick piers which returns along the eastern side of the building. A wide entrance stair, with rendered masonry upstands to either side, is located centrally. Non- original timber framed French doors with obscured glass panes and sidelights are located at the top of the stair, the verandah has been enclosed with glass louvres and compressed sheeting, and latticed timber panels are located between the brick piers supporting the verandah. The eastern gable end of the roof has decorative timber bargeboards, and a deck opening from the first floor of the rear wing is located adjacent to the gable end and is supported by timber posts above the enclosed eastern verandah. The deck has cross-braced timber balustrades and a decorative porch/aedicule forming the entrance to the first floor. The porch/aedicule has paired timber posts with cross-bracing, latticed timber valance, louvred timber shutters above balustrade height, and decorative timber gable with battens and curved timber elements. The decorative southern gable of the first floor is located above the porch/aedicule, and has a battened timber screen with an arched central section and curved timber trim. A sash window with corrugated iron sunhood is located adjacent to the porch/aedicule. The two-storeyed rear wing is constructed of chamferboard, and overhangs the ground floor of the early rear wing on the eastern and northern sides and is supported by timber posts with curved brackets. The eastern elevation of the first floor has centrally located French doors accessed via an external timber stair, and flanked by sash windows with timber shutters to either side. A continuous corrugated iron sunhood supported by curved timber brackets shades the first floor windows and doors. The northern elevation has a large L-shaped timber stair, which bridges a driveway, accessing a central first floor porch. The porch has paired timber posts with cross-bracing, cross-braced balustrades, and non-original French doors with obscured glass panes. The porch is flanked by sash windows, and a continuous corrugated iron sunhood supported by curved timber brackets shades the windows and porch. The stair has a stepped battened timber balustrade, and the southern gable has a battened timber screen with an arched central section at the base. The western elevation of the first floor has sash windows with timber shutters flanking a smaller non-original casement window. A continuous corrugated iron sunhood supported by curved timber brackets shades these windows. The northern rear side of Lochiel consists of the enclosed courtyard flanked by the two-storeyed rear wing to the east, and the \\"museum\\" wing to the west. The enclosed courtyard has a corrugated iron skillion roof supported by timber posts, with louvred glass panels and compressed sheeting forming the exterior wall. A recessed entrance is located centrally, with multi-paned bifolding timber doors. A rendered masonry chimney is located at the rear of the original section of the building adjacent to the enclosed courtyard. The \\"museum\\" wing is constructed of chamferboard and has a corrugated iron gable roof and is supported by brick piers with latticed timber infill panels. The southern elevation is highly decorative, with a central bay window flanked by non-original casement windows (with a corner window unit to the southwest corner) and surmounted by timber detailing to the gable. The bay has narrow sash windows with etched and coloured glass panes and timber shutters. The bay is crowned by a timber valance consisting of triple curved sections, and paired lancet windows with leadlight panels are located in the gable above. The gable has a metal finial, and a battened timber screen with an arched central section and curved timber trim supported by curved timber brackets. A non original door is located on the eastern side of the bay and is accessed via a timber stair. The rear elevation of the \\"museum\\" wing has a metal finial and a battened timber screen to the gable, similar to the front elevation however without any of the decorative timber detailing and trim. Paired lancet windows with leadlight panels are located in the gable above a lean-to addition, which consists of an early section at the western end (possibly part of the original \\"museum\\" wing), and later enclosures at the eastern end. The lean-to has louvred glass windows as well as a row of fixed glass high level windows. An entrance to the rear lean-to, with a corrugated iron hood with curved timber brackets, is located on the western side. A porch with decorative timber detailing protects a second entrance located mid-way along the western elevation (this entrance was possibly originally a bay window). The porch has a gable roof with latticed timber gable panel and balustrade, curved valance and paired timber posts with cross-bracing. A continuous window hood surmounts several non-original casement windows, and two dormer windows with arched leadlight panels are located on the western side of the roof. An internal lightwell, created during the conversion of the building to flats, is located on the eastern side of the \\"museum\\" wing. Internally, the earliest section of the building is of rendered masonry construction and comprises two large rooms either side of a wide central hall fronting the southern verandah. Both rooms have wide timber architraves and skirtings, French doors opening to the verandah, a panelled timber door with deep reveals opening into the central hall, and a fireplace with marble surround flanked by narrow windows (now closed over but originally opened to the rear courtyard) either side. The western room has an infilled opening on the western side and a coffered ceiling with timber beams and cornice, and the eastern room has a plaster ceiling and cornice. The central hall has a plaster ceiling and cornice, and the end has been partitioned off to create a storage cupboard and the original opening to the rear has been infilled, but its form is still visible from the rear. The enclosed verandah has a raked boarded ceiling, and the western end has been partitioned off with French doors accessing a bathroom with terrazzo floor. The enclosed eastern verandah houses a kitchen area at the northern end. Internally, the rear wing is also of rendered masonry construction and comprises two large rooms with plaster ceilings and cornices, and deep timber skirtings and a timber fireplace surround to the central room. Both rooms have non-original multi-paned doors opening onto the enclosed verandah/undercroft space of the two-storeyed rear wing. The northern end of this space houses a bathroom, and the northern end of the masonry rear wing has been extended with the addition of a kitchen (possibly a free-standing structure added prior to the construction of the second storey). This kitchen structure has a raked ceiling on either side to the underside of the collar-beam, two small centrally pivoted windows which open against the rear of the end wall of the masonry wing, and a door and sash window opening to the rear. The enclosed courtyard has been partitioned into several rooms, and has raked boarded ceilings and timber floors. The posts supporting the skillion roof have chamfered corners and are set back in line with the rear of the \\"museum\\" wing. Internally, the \\"museum\\" wing currently houses two flats, but originally consisted of predominantly one large room with exposed tie-beams and hammer- posts with decorative curved timber brackets and raked boarded ceiling. A non- original ceiling has been installed to the underside of the tie-beams, and the space above, which is lit by the leadlight gable and dormer windows, remains intact with evidence of the original location of exhibits being visible. The original timber floor, consisting of alternately dark and light timber boards giving a striped appearance remains intact. The \\"museum\\" has been partitioned into several rooms, with plaster ceilings and cornices, timber architraves and skirtings, and casement windows. A boarded ceiling with deep cornices and high level windows is located in the rear northeast room, which is the location of the maid's dining room and scullery prior to the building's conversion into flats. The rear room (within the lean-to) has boarded walls and raked ceiling, and was used as a work room at the rear of the museum prior to the conversion into flats. A lightwell has been inserted into the eastern side of the \\"museum\\" wing adjacent to the early section of the structure (in place of the original openings into the museum from the former dining room and courtyard), and provides light and ventilation to internal rooms adjacent. The basement of the early masonry core is constructed of painted stone with brick quoining, and comprises two large rooms either side of a narrow central room. The floor of the western room is below the adjacent ground level, and a doorway to the west is accessed via stone steps. A barred window with arched header opens to the south below the verandah, and a fireplace is located against the northern wall with a narrow window adjacent. The narrow central room opens off the western room via an adjoining doorway, and has a barred window with arched header to the south. The floor of the eastern room is at the adjacent ground level, and the room is accessed via a low opening to the east, with a window with arched header to the south. A flight of stone steps is located against the northern wall at the rear of the western room, and leads to the underside of the enclosed courtyard floor. A masonry room is located below the \\"museum\\" wing. This room is constructed of mostly unpainted brickwork, with some rendered brickwork at the front, and has tall sash windows opening to the surrounding below floor space. The room is accessed via a door in the eastern wall (adjacent to the door accessing the basement of the early masonry core) and a door in the western wall fronting the adjacent garden. A concrete path with brick retaining wall wraps around the rear of this room with a gate accessing the adjacent garden. Internally, this room has a ripple-iron ceiling and timber architraves. Lochiel has extensive gardens, particularly to the southern part of the property. A decorative lych gate is located at the southeast of the garden, on the corner of Toorak Road and Hillside Crescent. The lych gate has brick piers surmounting rendered retaining walls either side of a flight of concrete steps. The piers support a decorative hipped gable shingle roof, which has terracotta finials at the corners, and curved projecting rafters with shaped ends. Steel gates with a concave top edge are fixed to the garden side of the lych gate. The gates access a gravel path which leads to the southern entrance to Lochiel. Both Toorak Road and Hillside Crescent frontages have rendered brick retaining walls/fences, with a driveway gate at the northern end of the property. The gravel path from the lych gate leads to a circular area with a central tree. From this area, a set of concrete steps accesses a path/terrace surmounting an embankment, with a second set of concrete steps leading to the southern entrance to Lochiel. The circular area has a stone threshold and stone pillar, and the gravel path has stone edgings and stone garden features. The southwest section of the garden consists of a grove of mature trees with a wide terrace below a dry-stone embankment. A masonry retaining wall separates this area from a raised lawn and garden on the western side of the structure. The southeast section of the garden has an open lawn bordered by mature trees and shrubs. A masonry retaining wall separates this area from a raised lawn and garden on the eastern side of Lochiel. A storage shed is located to the east of Lochiel at the northern end of the lawn. The shed has a gable roof with ribbed pan and corrugated iron sheeting and chamferboard walls. The southern gable has decorative timber bargeboards surmounting a gabled porch with latticed timber gable panel and decorative timber detailing. Lean-to structures have been added to the sides and rear of this building. The rear of the property comprises an area of lawn with stone retaining walls to the rear boundary. Garages are located at the northwest corner of the property. The garages have a corrugated iron skillion roof supported by timber posts, with a weatherboard wall at the eastern end and timber garage doors. The garages contain part of the squared rubble-coursed sandstone structure of the original stables. The sandstone forms the rear wall of the structure, with three transverse wall sections, and the western end wall has a raked parapet. Brickwork surmounts the rear sandstone wall forming a parapet, and an early set of steps is located adjacent to the western end wall. The floor of the garage is concrete.  Heritage listing  Lochiel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 May 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Arguably unique and indeed highly idiosyncratic Lochiel comprises a substantial house, outbuildings, and large established garden situated on the lower slopes of Toorak Hill overlooking the Brisbane River. It is a rare, intact, and fine example of a suburban estate; its evolution over several stages (the earliest believed to date from the 1860s) well illustrating the development of Brisbane and one of its earliest suburbs, Hamilton. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.

The early masonry core of the house, with surviving lower service area, is both a fine and rare surviving example of its type. The more idiosyncratic nature of Lochiel is more particularly found however in the form, placement, and exuberant detailing of the substantial timber additions (museum and upper eastern wing by 1927) and in the very building of the museum room as a purpose built private exhibition space. The garden including structural elements (such as paths, steps, walls, and decorative features) and mature plantings is also considered a rare and intact example of a pre World War II garden. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. An investigation of the fabric of the house and garden and the publication of information believed held by the Cameron family have the potential to substantially contribute to the further understanding of the history of Lochiel.

Lochiel has considerable aesthetic qualities including the picturesque qualities of the house and garden (including garden structures) and the site itself with its views to the river The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Lochiel has a long association with JF Buckland, who was prominent in Brisbane's civic affairs.

The satellite was launched on 19 February 1960, at 20:15 GMT, from Vandenberg Air Force Base on the Thor-Agena launch vehicle. The booster began exhibiting abnormal pitch oscillations almost immediately at liftoff and Range Safety Officer sent the destruct command at T+56 seconds when allowable safety margins were exceeded. Most of the debris fell in and around launch complex LC 75-3-4. The failure was traced to a malfunction of Thor's guidance computer due to a suspected unauthorized repair modification. The first recovery of film from a CORONA vehicle occurred with the launching of DISCOVERER on 19 February 1960, but in a manner such that no one boasted of it. The THOR booster rocket began to fishtail not long after it left the launch pad and was destroyed by the range safety officer at 56 seconds after lift-off. The payload came down about 1 600 meters from Pad 5, was located by helicopter, and the recovery was made by a crew that rode to the scene by Jeep.https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi- publications/books-and-monographs/corona.pdf - 1995, p.20-21 DISCOVERER VII through DISCOVERER X carried only a quarter of a load of the film () to permit the carrying of additional instrumentation for testing vehicle performance. DISCOVERER 10 (NSSDCA ID: DISC10) was a US Air Force low-resolution photo surveillance satellite that was destroyed by Range Safety Officer before reaching orbit. The rocket had veered off course shortly after takeoff and was detonated by ground command at an altitude of at T+56 seconds after launch.https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=DISC10 - 5 September 2019 The DISCOVERER program was managed by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the Department of Defense and the U.S. Air Force. The primary goal of the program was to develop a film-return photographic surveillance satellite to assess how rapidly the Soviet Union was producing long-range bombers and ballistic missiles and where they were being deployed and to take photos over the Sino-Soviet bloc to replace the U2 spyplanes. It was part of the secret CORONA program which was also used to produce maps and charts for the Department of Defense and other US government mapping programs. The goal of the program was not revealed to the public at the time, it was presented as a program to orbit large satellites to test satellite subsystems and investigate the communication and environmental aspects of placing humans in space, including carrying biological packages for return to Earth from orbit. In all, 38 Discoverer satellites were launched by February 1962, although the satellite reconnaissance program continued until 1972 as the CORONA project. The program documents were declassified in 1995.

It was written by Baumbach and Greta Gerwig, and stars Gerwig and Lola Kirke. The film was released on August 14, 2015, by Fox Searchlight Pictures. Plot College freshman Tracy Fishko is having trouble adjusting to college life at Barnard. She eventually meets and befriends a fellow student, Tony, and even develops a crush on him, but when he begins dating another girl called Nicolette, she feels alone again. On her mother's advice, she contacts her soon-to-be stepsister Brooke, who also lives in New York. Tracy is immediately entranced by Brooke and her lifestyle. After spending a whirlwind night with her, she pens a short story and submits it to her college's prestigious literary magazine. Tracy continues to spend time with Brooke, who reveals her plans for a small and eclectic restaurant called Mom's after her dead mother; the restaurant is being financed by her partner. Upon returning home one night, however, Brooke finds herself locked out of her apartment and discovers that her boyfriend has withdrawn financial support. With massive bills for the restaurant coming due, Brooke visits a psychic with Tracy. Tracy interprets the psychic's words as meaning that Brooke should ask for the money from her former friend Mamie-Claire, with whom she had a falling-out after Mamie-Claire stole her idea for a business and married her former fianc√©. Tracy has Tony drive her and Brooke to Mamie-Claire's home in Connecticut, with Nicolette joining them to make sure that Tony and Tracy are not having an affair. At Mamie-Claire's home, Brooke and the others crash Mamie-Claire's book party, and Brooke pitches her restaurant to Mamie-Claire, hoping she will invest. Mamie-Claire, who confides to Tracy that she did steal Brooke's T-shirt idea to become rich, insists that she will have to talk to her husband, Dylan. While waiting for Dylan's arrival, Brooke takes a call from her father, who informs her that his wedding with Tracy's mother has been called off. When Dylan comes home, rather than dismiss Brooke, he asks her to pitch her restaurant. Brooke stumbles, but Tracy, still enthused by the project, helps her to pitch it. Dylan tells Brooke he will give her the money but insists that, rather than invest in it, he will give it to her to cover the debt she will have from dissolving the business. Seeing that Tracy is upset by this, and also the toxic effect the offer is immediately having on Dylan and Mamie- Claire's relationship, Brooke ultimately refuses the money. Meanwhile, Nicolette, who witnessed Tracy kissing Tony, confronts Tracy about her short story. The entire party reads it, and Brooke becomes offended by the brutal way in which Tracy characterized her. She informs her that they are no longer about to become sisters, as their parents no longer want to marry, and tells Tracy that she will sue. Upset, Tracy, sitting outside the house, takes a hit on the bong that Tony had earlier fashioned from an apple with her initial emblazoned on it, smoking weed that he had presumably stolen from Dylan's freezer. Tracy's story is accepted by the university's prestigious literary society, and for a while she joins the group. Still finding herself unable to fit in, she decides to start her own literary club, inviting both Tony and Nicolette to apply for membership. Finding herself alone on Thanksgiving, Tracy goes to Brooke's old apartment and finds her packing her things, about to move to Los Angeles. She learns that Brooke was able to cover her debts, as Mamie-Claire gave her what would have been her share of money from the T-shirt business. Brooke also tells her that she has passed the SAT and that she has been accepted into college and is considering going. Tracy invites Brooke to have Thanksgiving dinner with her.

The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States on December 1, 2015. Reception The film received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 81% of 180 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.35/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Mistress America brings out the best in collaborators Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig, distilling its star's charm and director's dark wit into a ferociously funny co-written story.\\" On Metacritic, it holds a 75 out of 100 rating based on 42 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Varietys review from Sundance read \\"Greta Gerwig shines in a tailor-made role in her and Noah Baumbach's spirited screwball follow-up to Frances Ha.\\" The central screwball-comedy section set in the Connecticut mansion divided critics. While conceding that the film's ending \\"resolves things on a basically satisfying, quasi-poignant note,\\" Todd McCarthy in The Hollywood Reporter stated that the \\"inconsistency of the approach overall, combined with Gerwig's maximum voltage performance, is disconcerting, even off-putting\\". Amy Nicholson, writing for LA Weekly, praised the casting of the section, and in particular the performance of Heather Lind, but found that the \\"clumsy\\" sequence \\"stops the movie cold\\". On the other hand, Peter Bradshaw, writing in The Guardian, praised the \\"outrageously farcical and funny extended sequence.\\" For Nigel Andrews in the Financial Times, the \\"neo-screwball\\" sequence exemplified the film's themes of love, art, and betrayal; he called the film \\"funny, witty, joyous, mischievous and casually profound.\\" References External links   Category:2015 films Category:2010s buddy comedy films Category:2010s female buddy films Category:2015 independent films Category:2010s screwball comedy films Category:American buddy comedy films Category:American female buddy films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American screwball comedy films Category:English- language films Category:Films about writers Category:Films directed by Noah Baumbach Category:Films set in Connecticut Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films set in universities and colleges Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films with screenplays by Greta Gerwig Category:2015 comedy films ","title":"Mistress America"},{"id":"44899778","text":"Yury Georgievich Gogotsi (born December 16, 1961, Kyiv, Ukrainian SSR) is a Ukrainian scientist in the field of material chemistry, professor at Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA since the year 2000 in the fields of Materials Science and Engineering and Nanotechnology.

History  Possibly originally known as Cassa Anna, this early Brisbane Spanish Mission style house was constructed for Mr and Mrs EF Powers. It was designed in 1927 by important Brisbane architect Eric Percival Trewern, who was instrumental in popularising the Spanish Mission style for domestic architecture in Brisbane. The builder was Burton Hollingsworth of Coorparoo, who constructed many of Trewern's residential designs. The site was first alienated from the Crown in 1853/54 by William Robert Howe Weekes of Brisbane, as part of a parcel of land which comprised the whole of Hamilton Hill through to what is now Crescent Road, and down to Eagle Farm Road (later Hamilton Road, then Kingsford Smith Drive) along the Brisbane River. In the 1860s Weekes sold much of this land to Brisbane auctioneer and politician James Robert Dickson, who erected Toorak House at the top of Hamilton Hill. By the mid-1870s Hillside Crescent had been formed, and the subdivision which was later the site of El Nido (subdivision 1 of allotment 6 of portion 1) had been created, with title held by Dickson. In late 1878 Dickson transferred title to subdivisions 1-3 of allotment 6 of portion 1 (three blocks between Hillside Crescent and Hamilton Road) to another Brisbane auctioneer and politician, John Francis Buckland, and an adjacent two blocks, also fronting Hamilton Road, (subdivisions 4 and 5) to dentist David Ralph Eden. Braeside House, a substantial two-storeyed residence, appears to have been erected on subdivisions 4 and 5, and was occupied by solicitor John Robb Baxter Bruce by 1883. In the early 1890s Bruce acquired title to all five subdivisions and part of the adjacent subdivision 6. The house stood about two-thirds of the way along the site, overlooking the Brisbane River. Braeside changed hands a number of times between 1902 and the 1920s, but remained on one title until the late 1920s. An aerial photograph of Hamilton Hill dated shows Braeside and its grounds very clearly. The main carriage drive led from a surveyed road (later closed) along the western boundary of subdivision 1 (near its intersection with Hillside Crescent), eastward across subdivisions 1-3 and parallel to Hillside Crescent, until it reached the house on subdivisions 4 and 5. Also evident in the photograph is a set of stairs leading south from the main carriage drive down the steep slope to another carriage drive running parallel to Hamilton Road. This second carriage drive led to two structures in the southwest corner of the estate (on subdivision 1), close to Hamilton Road, which may have been stables or garages. The stairs appear to be those still in existence at 25 Hillside Crescent, and shared by \\"gentleman's agreement\\" with the occupants of 19 Hillside Crescent, since the late 1920s. The Braeside Estate was subdivided during the 1920s economic boom, when rising Council rates combined with the lure of attractively increasing prices obtained for inner city suburban blocks in good locations, led to the subdivision of most of the remaining large suburban estates at New Farm, Hamilton, Ascot and Clayfield. Edward Ferdinand Powers acquired title to subdivision 1 in September 1927; title to subdivision 2 was transferred in 1928, as was that to Braeside on subdivisions 4 and 5 and re-subdivision 1 of subdivision 6; and subdivision 3 was transferred in 1932, although possibly sold in 1927‚Äì28. New houses on subdivisions 1-3 were erected and occupied by 1929. The block which Powers acquired in 1927 comprised of steeply sloping land with views over the Hamilton and Bulimba reaches of the Brisbane River, and east toward the mouth of the river. The site may also have contained the buildings associated with Braeside House, evident in the aerial photograph. In mid-1927 Powers commissioned architect EP Trewern to design a substantial Spanish Mission styled residence for this site, to take advantage of the views. The design was well publicised (likely by its architect) and attracted considerable interest at the time, being heralded in the Architectural and Building Journal of Queensland of 11 July 1927 as: > \\"The Spanish House Introduced to Brisbane Spanish architecture is to be > introduced to Brisbane in home designing. Mr EP Trewern, architect, has > received from a local medico a commission to erect a residence for him of > this type, and, as the location is on the Hamilton Heights, it will be seen > to advantage.\\" A similar claim that Spanish Mission design was being introduced to Brisbane was repeated in the Daily Mail newspaper of 28 October 1927:20, which published a sketch of the principal elevations. The same sketch also appeared in the Architectural and Building Journal of Queensland of 10 November 1927:54. Of particular interest were the Cordova-style roofing tiles, manufactured by the Shannon Brick and Tile Company (of Sydney and Brisbane) and reputedly used for the first time in Brisbane. Elements of Spanish Mission style were not new to Brisbane in 1927, having been used on picture theatre facades since the 1910s. Craigston Flats on Wickham Terrace, erected in 1927, employed elements of the Spanish Mission and/or Mediterranean styles. However, El Nido was the earliest or one of the earliest Spanish Mission style houses in Brisbane, and was designed by a prominent architect who subsequently popularised this style for domestic housing in Brisbane. Other important Spanish Mission style houses designed by Trewern include Santa Barbara at 209 Moray Street, New Farm (1929‚Äì30, cost ) and 17 Griffith Street, New Farm. EP Trewern's Brisbane architectural practice, established in 1920 and maintained until his death in 1959, proved highly successful. During the interwar years he was influential in popularising Georgian revival style in Brisbane commercial building, and Spanish Mission style in Brisbane residential architecture. He designed residences throughout Brisbane, and his interwar commercial work included business premises, flats and office renovations. His larger commissions included the Country Press Association Building at the corner of Elizabeth and Edward Streets (1924-25 - demolished); Heindorff's Building in Queen Street (1926-28 - demolished); Inchcolm Professional Chambers on Wickham Terrace (1929‚Äì30); and the new Surfers Paradise Hotel (1936-37 - demolished). Trewern was actively involved in furthering professional architectural standards in Queensland. He served as Vice- President of the Queensland Institute of Architects 1929‚Äì30, Member Board of Architects of Queensland 1929‚Äì35, Fellow of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects 1930, President Queensland Institute of Architects 1931‚Äì35, Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects 1931; Vice-President of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects 1932‚Äì33, and Federal Councillor 1932‚Äì35. Brisbane City Council building approval for El Nido was granted in November 1927. Expected to cost , the brick and stucco residence was one of the most expensive houses erected in Brisbane in the late 1920s. In 1927 Brisbane was experiencing \\"boom\\" economic conditions; even so, most houses were erected in timber, and in the financial year 1927‚Äì28, the average cost of an average 4-roomed timber house with kitchen and front and back verandahs was . In 1927-28 a very comfortable timber residence could be erected for between and , and more elaborate and stylish timber homes averaged between and . The 20th century construction of domestic dwellings in brick or concrete was still in its infancy in Brisbane, and El Nido was at the cutting edge of this movement. In the twelve months from November 1927 to October 1928, approvals were given for only four homes of greater cost than El Nido: a brick and stone house at Ascot to cost ; two brick houses at Clayfield priced at and respectively, and a timber residence at Clayfield costing . El Nido and its middle class contemporaries were as close to mansion status as Brisbane generated in this era. In February 1928 EF Powers took out a mortgage on his Hamilton Road property, which may have helped finance the construction of Cassa Anna (or El Nido), which appears to have been completed and occupied (possibly not by Powers initially) by 1929. The house and its garage, the latter accessed off Hamilton Road, figure prominently in an aerial photograph of Hamilton published in The Queenslander of 19 March 1931. Cassa Anna was considered one of Brisbane's most beautiful homes, and was featured in the January 1933 issue of the Brisbane society publication Steering Wheel and Society and Home, reflecting the social status of its owners. It is not clear whether Powers was a medical practitioner as reported in the Architectural and Building Journal of Queensland in 1927. He appears to be the Edward F Powers who married Olive MacDermott in Sydney in 1927, suggesting that Brisbane was not their home city. They did not occupy the building for any length of time, possibly not taking up residence there until . They undertook a world tour in 1932, during which time they lent the house to Sydney friends. Then in April 1933 title was transferred to medical practitioner Robert Graham Brown. In January 1937 Brown transferred the property to Norman Edward Gow of Brisbane, who retained the house for nearly 20 years. Gow also appears to have leased the house to other occupants for some years, possibly even to the former owner, Dr Brown, who remains listed in the Post Office Directories as resident here until at least 1940. By at least May 1938 the house was known as El Nido (meaning \\"the nest\\" or \\"the home\\" in Spanish). It was occupied at the time by JP Ragland, consul for the United States of America, and was a focus for \\"society\\" functions in Brisbane. During the Second World War (1939‚Äì45) a concrete air-raid shelter was erected along the northern boundary of the property. El Nido decorated for the royal visit in 1954 In honour of the royal visit of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh to Brisbane in 1954, the occupants of prominently- positioned El Nido decorated the front elevation of their house with the British Coat of Arms and the lettering \\"God Save the Queen\\". The elaborate decoration would have been seen from the river and from the Brisbane Airport approach to the city, along Hamilton Road (Kingsford Smith Drive). Between 1957 and 1975 the property changed hands three times, before sale to the present owners in 1978. It remains a private residence, and retains its views over the Brisbane River and eastward toward the river entrance.  Description  El Nido is a large, Spanish Mission style residence situated prominently on the steep southern slope of Hamilton Hill, overlooking the Hamilton and Bulimba reaches of the Brisbane River, with views south/southwest across the city centre and east toward the mouth of the river. The house is accessed both from Hillside Crescent and from Kingsford Smith Drive, but sits well above Kingsford Smith Drive. It is a landmark building, seen from the river, from the Bulimba and Newstead areas, and from along Kingsford Smith Drive. The house is a substantial, roughcast rendered brick building of two storeys with a sub-floor, taking advantage of the slope of the site. Elements of the Spanish Mission style include: a complex main hipped roof and small ancillary skillion roofs at various heights, all clad in Cordova style terracotta tiles; the use of colonnaded verandahs with semi-circular arches, barley twist columns and wrought iron balustrades; and the white roughcast exterior. The entrance is from the western side of the building; the southern elevation, overlooking the river, is considered the \\"front\\". The originally open verandahs on the southern elevation have been enclosed with glazing, but the colonnade effect has been preserved. Internally, the house remains substantially intact, with original timber wall panelling in the public rooms, and decorative leadlight windows throughout. Extensive views are obtained from the dining and living rooms on the eastern side of the house. At the southern end of the block is a garage, accessed off Kingsford Smith Drive. This building is similarly designed with a Spanish Mission feel, with its roughcast rendered exterior walls and Cordova tiled roof. The grounds also contain stone terracing (which may be remnants of the Braeside garden); concrete paving and stairs, including access to the stairs at 25 Hillside Crescent; and a private air-raid shelter of concrete construction at the northern end of the block, erected during the Second World War. This structure has been rendered to resemble the finish to the house. The concrete stairs at 25 Hillside Crescent which lead to Kingsford Smith Drive are included in the heritage register boundary, having been used as an alternative means of access to El Nido for over 70 years. The top of these stairs has been extended onto the El Nido property to facilitate this use, and there are two landings further down the slope which permit access from 19 Hillside Crescent.  Heritage listing  El Nido was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 February 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. El Nido, erected in 1928, was an important and expensive house of its era, which remains important in illustrating the pattern of Brisbane suburban infill in the 1920s and 1930s, when the large suburban estates of the 1880s and 1890s were subdivided for closer density middle class housing. The extent of this infill was not rivalled until the late 20th century. The house is illustrative of the new trend toward brick construction for Brisbane's more expensive homes, a reflection of a booming economy. Its design is credited with being instrumental in popularising Spanish Mission residences in Brisbane in the interwar period, and reputedly its construction introduced the Cordova tile to Brisbane. The grounds retain the original garage, a private Second World War air-raid shelter, and early terracing. Included in the heritage register boundary is an early set of steps located on the adjacent block to the eastern of El Nido. These steps, which lead to Kingsford Smith Drive, were associated with the suburban villa known as Braeside, and have been shared by the residents of 19 and 25 Hillside Crescent since the late 1920s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. El Nido is one of the earliest and best conceived of the interwar Spanish Mission style houses erected in Brisbane, important in illustrating the principal characteristics of its type: a substantial, decorative, middle-class residence designed in the Spanish Mission style to take advantage of a steeply sloping block with extensive views across Brisbane and along the Brisbane River. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Situated prominently along a major arterial road, the building was designed to be viewed and to impress. Building and grounds retain strong aesthetic value, and are significant for their landmark quality.

San Francisco, Underwood/Miller, 1983, page 219. It first appeared in book form in the anthology From Unknown Worlds (Street & Smith, 1948). It later appeared in the collections The Reluctant Shaman and Other Fantastic Tales (Pyramid, 1970), The Best of L. Sprague de Camp (Doubleday, 1978), and Aristotle and the Gun and Other Stories (Five Star, 2002), as well as the anthologies The Fantasy Hall of Fame (Arbor House, 1983), The Science Fictional Olympics (Signet, 1984), Mermaids! (Ace Books, 1986), Unknown (Baen, 1988) and The Fantasy Hall of Fame (HarperPrism, 1998) (a different anthology from the 1983 book of the same title). The story has been translated into French, German, and Italian. Plot summary Swimming coach Louis Connaught has entered his prize pupil Maria Santalucia in a women's swim meet in expectation of the usual victory; as Santalucia, born with webbed fingers, has an advantage over the other swimmers. Then his arch- rival coach Herbert Laird arrives, causing a strange commotion. When Connaught sees why he shouts a strenuous protest. The story flashes back to the previous evening, when Herb has his friend, lawyer Mark Vining, over to his house. He has a plan to beat Louis Connaught and wants Mark along \\"to think up legal reasons why my scheme's okay.\\" He introduces the lawyer to his proteg√©, Miss Iantha Delfoiros, a young woman in a wheelchair of strikingly exotic appearance. Mark is fascinated by Iantha, but she is evasive about her background. He learns only that she is from Cyprus and has surprising personal habits; for instance, she adds salt to her drinking water on the claim that fresh water makes her drunk, and eats all her food cold. Another layer of mystery is added when Herb asks Mark if he can legally accept gold coins hundreds of years old in exchange for ten thousand swimming caps; a deal supposedly proposed by Iantha. Increasingly concerned about this \\"crazy business\\" Mark demands to know what is going on before consenting to be party to it. Swearing him to secrecy, Herb and Iantha agree. Iantha pulls up the blanket covering her lower half to reveal a pair of horizontal flukes where her feet should be. When the next day they enter Iantha in the swim meet, Connaught is naturally outraged to discover his star pupil will be going up against a mermaid. He raises every objection he can think of, only to be countered by Mark, who calmly citing and interpreting the rules of the swimming association with his legal expertise demonstrates there is in fact \\"nothing in the rules\\" to prevent Iantha from competing. And the mermaid performs more than creditably, winning the first race in a record eight seconds. The second has to be redone when Iantha accidentally rams another contestant who strayed from her lane, but she easily comes in first both times. At this point, to Connaught's consternation but Herb's delight, Maria Santalucia refuses to swim in any more races with Iantha. But the conspirators' triumph is short-lived. Iantha is now behaving strangely, breaking out into song and flirting with Mark. Mark and Herb realize she is getting tipsy; it turns out that fresh water really does make her drunk. But she has two more races to go if she is to win the meet. She is sober enough to take the first. Then Connaught asks that the final event be held up a couple of minutes, as one of his swimmers has been \\"delayed.\\" Herb is suspicious, and justly so, as his rival comes back with a sea lion. With the rules already having been bent as far as they have, the judge allows the entry. Iantha and the sea lion are the only competitors in the final race, the other contestants refusing to get in the water with an animal. The sea lion, coaxed by rewards of fish at the end of each leg, proves much faster than even the mermaid. It is winning handily until Mark and a couple girls from Herb's swim team run in with bowls of goldfish. Spiking the pool with these, they completely distract the creature from any thought of finishing the race, with the result that Iantha is once again victorious. Connaught is livid, but, as with entering a mermaid, there is nothing in the rules against putting fish in the pool. Mark lets the referee and the coaches fight it out and attends to Iantha, now extremely inebriated, sitting on the edge of the pool, paddling her flukes in the water, and eating some of the goldfish. She whacks the sea lion across the head when it tries to steal some, and again breaks out into song. Mark convinces her to return to her wheelchair, albeit with difficulty, but in picking her up misjudges her weight; both fall into the pool, and Iantha, thinking he is being playful, nearly drowns him responding in kind. Early the next morning, before an expected swarm of reporters can converge on Herb's house, he and Mark drive Iantha back to the ocean. Mark has a long last talk with the mermaid and learns more of her background and how Herb convinced her to enter the meet. The merfolk, friendly with land people in ancient times, grew wary of them over the ages and now try to keep their existence secret except when they need to trade for goods they cannot make themselves, like knives and spears ... and now, swimcaps. Chosen as her people's representative in negotiating the swimcap deal, she only agreed to appear in Herb's competition because she hadn't realized how much fuss it would raise. She is contrite about having hurt Mark, whom she realizes has become infatuated with her. She returns his feelings, but aware that relationships between members of their two species never turn out well. The two do, however, share a farewell kiss.

History  The British entered Chin state in 1777 and began colonial administration in 1890. In 1892 the British called the Chin-Lushai conference for the Chin and the Lushai, both hill tribes. The British favoured uniting the Chin and Lushai into one administration, but the Lushai rejected the plan. The Lushai hill tribe then took a new name, Mizo, a poetic word for the Zomi. In 1933, Vum Thu Muang founded the Chin National Union. In 1944 the various groups, such as Sukte Independence Army were raised in Burma. In 1947 modern Burma was assembled from five countries, including Chin, Kachin, federated Shan state, Karen state and Burma according to the Panglong agreement. This agreement outlined each state's right to be self-administered after ten years from the date of agreement. However, the union of Burma was politically collapsing and the agreement fell apart. In 1960, the Chin Liberation Army was founded by Tun Kho Pum Baite to re-unify the Chin people while the Mizo National Front (MNF) strove for Mizo independence. MNF ended with the Mizoram state's creation by the Indian government. This movement did not cover all of Zogam. The Zomi Revolutionary Army was then created. Now the Hill people (Zomi) re-unification group is the Zomi Revolutionary Army. The 8888 uprising took place in 1988. Students were protesting against the Burmese government. Zomi students were involved and founded the Chin National Army (CNA). The CNA continued its campaign against the Burmese government for about six months, until it was destroyed and many corpses were recovered from their camps. Some members went into hiding, while others founded small armed groups. The CNA was rejected by the Zomi National Congress. After a few months, the CNA asked for a ceasefire agreement with the Burmese government.

The documentary details Estrada's childhood and acting career, his rise to political prominence as mayor of San Juan in Metro Manila and his election as Senator, and finally his rise to the presidency and his ouster in the Second EDSA Revolution. Originally set to be broadcast on two television networks, ABC and UNTV, the documentary was never aired publicly after it was controversially given an \\"X\\" rating by the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB). Synopsis To Live for the Masses is divided into four parts, each narrating Joseph Estrada's childhood, acting career and life as a politician, with the fourth part dedicated to events leading to and surrounding the 2001 EDSA Revolution as narrated from his point of view. Reception On August 28, 2006, the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board gave To Live for the Masses an \\"X\\" rating‚Äîreduced from the original \\"XXX\\" rating given on August 22‚Äîclaiming that film was libelous and served to undermine people's faith in government, which at the time was led by Estrada's successor and former Vice President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. The rating, which prevented the documentary's \\"public exhibition\\", was controversial, with Ronald Lumbao, spokesman of the People's Movement Against Poverty (PMAP), comparing the MTRCB's decision to a similar case in 1965 involving the alleged banning by Diosdado Macapagal, Arroyo's father, of the pro-Ferdinand Marcos film Iginuhit ng Tadhana (Drawn by Destiny), released prior to the 1965 presidential election which Macapagal subsequently lost. In response to the rating, Estrada supporters picketed the MTRCB offices on August 31, 2006. Senator Franklin Drilon, during deliberations for the board's 2007 budget, claimed that the MTRCB did not have the mandate to censor on the basis of libel, even going so far as alluding that the rating was a return to the era of martial law, when censorship was rampant. In the House of Representatives, Minority Floor Leader Francis Escudero claimed that only pornographic films received \\"X\\" ratings, and that there was nothing indecent about the documentary. Estrada's lawyers subsequently appealed to Arroyo, who convened a special committee chaired by Cecilia Guidote-Alvarez, chairwoman of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), ultimately referring the case back to the MTRCB on November 9, 2006, and suggesting that the film may be shown only after cutting around two-thirds of its original length. An MTRCB appeals committee decided in favor of lifting the ban on the film, but against immediate public exhibition, in January 2007. A case was later filed by the producers of the film with the Supreme Court, who later referred the case to the Court of Appeals (CA). While the court ruled in May 2007 that the MTRCB has to explain its decision, it ultimately affirmed the MTRCB's decision on December 1, 2008. The decision was criticized by Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel, Jr., who presided over Estrada's impeachment trial, saying that it violated his freedom of speech. Distribution and exhibition As the case was being heard by the MTRCB, the producers of To Live for the Masses nonetheless sought to show the film. Immediately after the release of the MTRCB's decision, the producers announced that they intend to show the film in Plaza Miranda owing to its status as a freedom park. Whereas the city government of Manila refused, deferring to the MTRCB's judgment. A screening of the documentary meanwhile was supposedly organized for members of the House of Representatives on October 12, 2006. However, it is not known whether the screening actually took place. VCD and DVD copies of the film were also produced, but owing to the MTRCB's ruling, distribution using that medium didn't occur. However, Artemio Raymundo, a first lieutenant with the Philippine Marine Corps, was arrested for distributing the documentary, which he claimed he did out of his own volition after chancing on copies of the documentary while riding the LRT, and was recommended for court-martial‚Äîostensibly on an unrelated case‚Äîin December 2006. Estrada's official website, erap.ph, featured a link to the documentary, saved as a Windows Media Video file.

He became Grand Mufti again after Afifi's death. Personal life Born in Binufar, Gharbia governorate, Egypt. Mohamed studied at the Al-Azhar University in Cairo, where he received his doctorate; he taught Islamic studies from 1988 to 1996 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. On 18 September 2011 he was appointed as Australia's Grand Mufti by the Australian National Imams Council (ANIC), replacing Fehmi Naji, who retired due to poor health. Activities After moving to Sydney in 1997, Mohamed founded a radio station soon called Quran Kareem Radio, broadcasting Koranic readings and other religious programs 24 hours a day. The radio station's content is mostly in Arabic; it relies on local donations and advertising for funding. In 2005, Mohamed founded a respite centre for Muslims with special needs, which he still manages. In 2012 Mohamed visited the Gaza Strip, where he met Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and told local news agencies, \\"I am pleased to stand on the land of jihad to learn from its sons\\". He is said to support Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who he met in Qatar in April 2013. Mohamed is member of a Tribunal which resolves disputes using Sharia Law based mediation. These mediation sessions are conducted weekly, from Mohamed's Fairfield office. Views Though Mohamed was once described as \\"a political moderate, [but] religiously orthodox\\" in a 2011 article in the Sydney Morning Herald,Zwartz, Barney. \\"The Man and the Mufti.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald. 20 October 2011. he was found on numerous occasions to promote anti-west and homophobic views sympathetic to radical Islamism while associating with the convicted terrorists. In 2011 Mohammed said that Sharia laws which call for \\"freedom, justice and right of speech\\" correspond with Australian laws. In response to concerns over the radicalisation of young Muslim men in Australia, Mohamed has stated that he believes that the cause is the spread of \\"backyard prayer halls,\\" run by self-styled imams preaching extremist ideologies. The solution to radicalisation, according to Mohamed, is for the Muslim community to build more traditional Islamic centres; his long-term vision, along with the ANIC, was to facilitate the building of mosques large enough to accommodate gyms, lecture halls and facilities for women and children. According to Mohamed, the Muslim community's building applications for new mosques are frequently met with rejection from local councils; he argues that existing mosques cannot keep pace with the community's growing needs, leading to increased feelings of isolation, rejection and anger among Muslims.YONI BASHAN. \\"Grand Mufti Dr Ibrahim Abu Mohamed believes more mosques are the solution.\\" The Sunday Telegraph. 26 May 2013. In his 1993 book An Invitation To Contemplate he said that non-Muslims wanted their women to walk around, ‚Äúexposed as a piece of sweet pastry ... devoured by the eyes of men\\" and he met Islamist terrorist Man Monis during a visit to the Villawood detention centre, along with the leader of radical Islamic group Hizb ut-Tahrir. Mohamed has defended Islam's \\"longstanding\\" anti-gay position here he claimed \\"no person can ever change\\", by describing homosexuality and lesbianism as 'sexual perversion' while also blaming low fertility rates in the West on 'loose extramarital sexual conduct'. He said that any attempt to call out these Islamic teachings could lead to radicalisation of Muslims. Lobbying In October 2014 Mohamed and the ANIC called for the offence of \\"advocating terrorism\\" to be removed from the \\"Foreign Fighters Bill\\", currently before the Australian Parliament, saying a cleric could fall foul of the law simply by \\"advocated the duty of a Muslim to defend his land\\" or if he referred to stories in the Quran, Bible and Torah in his sermons. In February 2015 Mohamed said the Australian Government should not ban Hizb ut-Tahrir saying the group is, \\"actually pro-freedom of speech\\". Tony Abbott, the Australian Prime Minister at the time, responded by saying the comments were \\"unhelpful\\". After the November 2015 Paris attacks, in a Press Release by the Australian National Imams Council, Mohamed made some controversial remarks that: \\"These recent incidents highlight the fact that current strategies to deal with the threat of terrorism are not working. It is therefore imperative that all causative factors such as racism, Islamophobia, curtailing freedoms through securitisation, duplicitous foreign policies and military intervention must be comprehensively addressed\\". He was later criticized for not directly condemning the Paris attacks. This led to a further statement: \\"We wish to emphasise it is incorrect to imply that the reference to causative factors provides justification for these acts of terrorism.\\" and \\"Dr. Ibrahim Abu Mohamed have consistently and unequivocally condemned all forms of terrorist violence.\\" In December 2015 Mohamed, along with other high-profile imams, issued a new year's message supporting a fatwa condemning Islamic State. In the message they stated that \\"most Islamic Legal Circles and Fatwa Boards have condemned ISIS\\", and warned young people to avoid the organisation's propaganda. Mohamed, in a submission to a federal government inquiry, has called for the Racial Discrimination Act to be updated to include protections against religious vilification. Liberal senator James Paterson, a member of the parliamentary joint committee on human rights said, ‚ÄúEffectively that would mean Australia has a national blasphemy law because criticising someone's religious beliefs in a way that offended them could breach the law\\". Defamation case In April 2016 Mohamed commenced civil proceedings for defamation, against News Corporation for alleged damages relating to the publication of two articles.

In contrast to the traditional football kick used at the time in which the kicker would approach the ball from directly behind and contact the ball with his foot, Bednarski approached the ball from roughly a 45-degree angle and made contact with the ball with the side of his foot, swinging his like in a \\"golf club\\"-like motion.

The film had its world premiere on 23 August 2013 at the London FrightFest Film Festival and centers upon a group of friends that finds themselves hunted by a sadistic killer. The film's title implies that it is the second film in a series but is actually the first film, as Entreinger thought that it would be interesting to film a \\"sequel\\" before creating the first film. Sadik 2 references the fictional first film by having the characters reference it by commenting that Sadik became popular due to rumors that it was a snuff film, as all of the actors were genuinely murdered on camera. Synopsis A group of friends has decided to head out to a secluded rental house in order to hang out and hold a New Year's Eve party. Each party goer has their own plans to make the night memorable, but they're ill-prepared for when one of the group goes missing and someone begins picking them off one by one.

He described it by saying that he \\"wanted to do a sort of soap TV show that goes into horror afterwards. So you have two stories; the TV show that looks like a TV comedy stuff, and then it goes into horror. Entreinger and his co-writer Jean-Nicolas Laurent wanted to make a film similar to the Scream and Saw franchises and they decided to make the film sequel before making the initial film, which is referenced in the film's title of Sadik 2. It took Entreinger AND Laurent about two to three weeks to complete the script for Sadik 2, which they wrote in Laurent's apartment. Filming took place over a seven-day period and the crew shot on average 10 sequences a day. This was made somewhat more difficult as part of the filming had to be shot in a basement that was not part of the house used for another location, necessitating that the crew move between the two locations.

It recounts the history of slavery in a global context. It was praised widely as a full and comprehensive rendering of the subject and won the 2007 Ralph Waldo Emerson Award. Davis, a leading authority on slavery in the western world, has said the impetus for the book began as a series of lectures for a course he taught on slavery at Yale in 1994. Davis' own interest in slavery began with his experiences with the segregation and sometimes mistreatment of black soldiers when he was stationed in Germany as an eighteen-year-old sailor during the last days of World War II. Premise Inhuman Bondage: The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World traces slavery from its ancient foundations through the long evolution of antiblack racism. Davis iterates time and again that slavery played a crucial role in the building of the United States, from the emergence of the American colonies to laying the foundation for ‚Äú...everything America was to become‚Äù. In laying out a more precise definition of the term slavery, Davis expands Orlando Patterson's definition--that of extreme \\"permanent, violent, and personal domination of natally alienated and generally dishonored persons‚Äù--to incorporate the attribution to humans of 'animalization', which allows the master to deny any redeeming rational and spiritual qualities to the enslaved that would otherwise bind the two together. Unlike many scholarly efforts, Davis does not devote the entire book to the Atlantic slave trade. Instead he highlights the international character of the slave trade through intervening perspectives and factors such as nations, politicians, the media, and both black and white abolitionism. Contents Relying heavily on the account laid out in Howard Jones' Mutiny on the Amistad: The Saga of a Slave Revolt and Its Impact on American Abolition, Law, and Diplomacy (New York, 1987; rev ed., 1988), as well as on court records, newspaper accounts, and other primary sources, Davis begins the book by using what happened on the 19th century ship, La Amistad, because he believes the case illustrated how the American justice system of the time dealt with the multinational character of the Atlantic slave trade. He goes on to cover slavery during antiquity, a comprehensive account of the origins of anti-black racism, slavery in Brazil and the Caribbean, American slavery in colonial America and Mexico, the French Revolution, the Haitian Revolution, the involvement of Africans in the slave trade, national politics of slavery in the United States, 2 chapters on the characteristic brand of 19th-century slavery in the southern United States, the Civil War, two chapters on British and American abolitionism, and emancipation. Critical reception The book received universal acclaim as a comprehensive and career capping effort on the part of the author and the subject matter. Pulitzer Prize winning author Eric Foner called Inhuman Bondage ‚Äúone of the finest one-volume histories of the rise and fall of modern slavery.\\" References External links * Yale University Department of History.

There is no scientific evidence about this female priesthood in the religion of ifa or ifaism. Only literature without any kind of proof, is what has been presented as bibliography. WIKIPEDIA. please take note on this. Iyalawo is a term in the Yoruba language that literally means Mother of Mysteries or Mother of Wisdom (√åy√°: ‚Äúmother‚Äù; aw√≥ ‚Äúmysteries\\"). Some adherents use the term \\"Mamalawo,\\" which is a partially African diaspora version of the Yoruba term, Iyal√°wo and Yeyelawo are two more versions of mother of mysteries. √åy√°n√≠f√° is a Yoruba word that can be translated as Mother (√åy√°) has or of (n√≠) If√° or Mother in If√°. Differences between terms While Iyal√°wo and √åy√°n√≠f√° are often used interchangeably, the terms have different denotations and connotations. The term Iyan√≠fa specifically relates to If√° and could indicate that a female undertakes Ifa divination or is a custodian of Ifa in a personal or professional capacity; the term may also indicate that a woman has had Itefa or itelodu initiation. The term Iyal√°wo indicates a woman who has knowledge of sacred wisdom that may include Ifa but goes beyond If√° . The significance of the Iyal√°wo in Yoruba cosmology is said to extend to its creator, Od√π. In The Architects of Existence: √Äj·∫πÃÅ in Yoruba Cosmology, Ontology, and Orature, Teresa N. Washington says of Od√π: ‚ÄúOd√π, as the √Äj·∫πÃÅ, is the consummate Iyal√°wo: The mysteries of the Cosmos swirl in the core of her being.‚Äù Another term, Apetibi , is sometimes confused with Iyanifa or Iyalawo but is not the same. An Apetibi is considered a wife of Orunmila or a Babalawo. An apetibi is not initiated into the mysteries of Ifa and has not received Itefa or itelodu levels of initiation. If√° is a divination system that represents the oracular utterance of Od√π, who is also known as Od√πduw√†. Linguist and cultural historian Modupe Oduyoye reveals that the meaning of Od√πduw√† is Od√π-√≥ d√° √¨w√† \\"Oracular utterance created existence.\\" The system that Od√π devised for human beings to manifest their destiny is called Od√π If√°, and the chief emissary of Od√π If√° is Orisha Orunmila. Both Babal√°wo and Iyan√≠fa use If√° and its tools, including the divining chain known as Opele or the sacred palm nuts called Ikin, on the traditionally wooden divination tray called Opon If√°, to help their clients better understand their paths in life. Historical accounts of Iyalawo and Iyanifa  According to Babalawo K. Ositola from Ijebu, Nigeria, it was a woman , Odu, who taught her husband Orunmila how to divine so that he could communicate with the spiritual world. The history of women casting Ifa is well-documented in the ese Ifa. Oyeronke Olajubu's Women in the Yoruba Religious Sphere analyzes an ese Ifa of Eji Ogbe in which Orunmila is asked why his daughter is not practicing Ifa. When he replies that she is female, he is informed that that is no taboo. Following this, Orunmila's daughter studied Ifa and \\"From then on women have studied Ifa / They prescribe sacrifice / They are initiated into the Ifa corpus.\\"Women in the Yoruba Religious Sphere, page 116 A verse in Iwori Meji mentions that Orunmila's daughter is named Alara and that she underwent an apprenticeship from Orunmila. When he had a son, she was responsible for a large part of her younger brother's training. The Arugba Ifa, mother of Onibogi, the 8th Alaafin of Oyo, is documented as introducing Ifa to Oyo . Arugba Ifa initiated the Alado of Ato into Ifa, as well. The Alado later initiated the priests of Oyo into Ifa. The sacred odu Oturupon Irete cites a woman named Oluwo being initiated into Ifa after giving birth to a son by Oduduwa. That son became known as the Ooni. The Ifa Odu Odi Ogbe speaks of a woman divining and performing ritual sacrifice for Orunmila by the name Eruko-ya-l'egan o d'Oosa also known as Orisa Oke. The Od√π If√° describes how an √åy√°n√≠f√° called Ugbin Ejo divines for √íf√∫n M√©ji and also eventually becomes the mother of √ígb√≥ni. Royal mothers of Yoruba rulers were also necessarily Iyal√°wo and √åy√°n√≠f√°. For example, Biodun Adediran in \\"Women, Rituals, and Politics in Pre-Colonial Yorubaland\\" reveals that the √åy√° M·ªçl·∫πÃÄ serves as the Yoruba rulers' ‚Äúpersonal Ifa priestess and head of all Ifa priests.‚Äù Another documented African Iyalawo was Agbaye Arabinrin Oluwa, who lived c. 200 AD in Nigeria.Iyanfia: Women of Wisdom, page 362 Chief Fama Aina Adewale Somadhi, a contemporary and prominent Yoruba born Iyalawo, was initiated in 1988 by Chief ‚ÄòFagbemi Ojo Alabi, the late Araba of Ayetoro town, Egbado, and the Oluwo (or High Priest) of Ogun State, Nigeria. The first documented American Iyalawo was Dr. D'Haifa Odufora Ifatogun, who was initiated in 1985.Iyanifa: Women of Wisdom, Chapter Historical Notes, pg 352 Mattie Curtis-Iyanifa Ifakemi Oyesanya, initiated in the Oyesanya Compound by Araba Oyesanya and Ayoka Oyesanya ,baptized into Yoruba Religion by pioneering Babalawo and Babalorisha Dr. Cliff Stewart (Oba Dekun) was the first African American women initiated into Ifa in 1993. The first Lucumi Iyaonifas initiatied were Mar√≠a Cuesta Conde and Nidia Aguila de Le√≥n in 2000.CITIZENSHIP, RELIGION AND REVOLUTION IN CUBA by Carolyn E. Watson, University of New Mexico, December 2009 Training Iyalawo undergo training in the memorization and interpretation of the 256 Odu or mysteries, as well as in the numerous verses or Ese of If√°. Traditionally, the Iyalawo usually have additional professional specialties. For instance, several would also be herbalists, while others would specialize in extinguishing the troubles caused by Ajogun. The Iyalawos are, however, generally trained in the determination of problems, or to divine how good fortune can be maintained, and the application of both spiritual and related secular diagnosis and solutions. Their primary function is to assist people in finding, understanding, and being in alignment with one's individual destiny until they experience spiritual wisdom as a part of their daily experience. The Iyalawo is charged with helping people develop the discipline and character that supports such spiritual growth called \\"Iwa Pele\\", or good character. This is done by identifying the client's spiritual destiny, or Ori, and developing a spiritual blueprint which can be used to support, cultivate, and live out that destiny.  Lineage variations of Iyanifa  The position of Iyalawo is found in both West Africa and in the Americas. Every town, country and lineage has different customs, although most towns in Yorubaland initiate women at present. The priesthood of women is denied by many in the Lucum√≠ tradition in Cuba. As with the various lineages throughout the Caribbean and the Americas, the Lucum√≠ lineage is distinct from African lineages, as can be seen in an accord reached by a group of Lucum√≠ Oba Oriat√©s, Babalaos, and Olorich√°s on June 2, 2010. Initially, the Cuban lineage dominated the United States due to the large influx of Cuban immigrants settling in its large cities. As a result, the position of Iyanifa did not become well known in the States until the 1990s, when African American women began to go to Africa for their initiations. In the book Orisa Devotion as World Religion, Dr. Eason recounts how in 1992, the King of Oyotunji, Adefunmi, under pressure from women at Oyotunji to allow them to be initiated as If√° priests, went to Benin, having assumed that Ile Ife did not initiate women at the time.Eason, Ikulomi Djisovi. ‚ÄúHistoricizing If√° Culture in Oyotunji African Village.‚Äù In Orisa Devotion as World Religion: The Globalization of Yoruba Religious Culture, edited by Jacob Kehinde Olupona and Terry Rey, 278‚Äì85. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2008. It is noted that women have always received Ifa initiations in West Africa through Ifa, Afa, or Fa, as it is known in various lineages. The pressure began in Oyotunji after Iyanifa Ifafunmike Osunbunmi was initiated in Osogbo, Nigeria, in 1995 by the babalawo Ifayemi Elebuibon, the Araba of Osogbo. In the book \\"Iyanifa: Women of Wisdom\\", she recounts the initial resistance of Oyotunji village because its people did not know women could be initiated up to that point. Ode Remo is an example of a Yoruba kingdom that does not currently offer Itefa to women. Ode Remo demonstrates a history of once having done so, as noted in the book \\"Women in the Yoruba Religion\\" by Ode Remo author Oluwo Olotunji Somorin. This claim is further substantiated by other sources. There are hundreds of women initiated as Iyalawos or Iyanifas in West Africa and the diaspora, according to the Ifa Women's Association. American women are the fastest growing group of priests in the tradition . This is due to American women having advanced degrees and the financial resources to support themselves and finance trips to Africa. They are still challenged by some houses in the Cuban Lukumi community, houses generally headed by males, which actively oppose their ministries. Many women have been reported to be ostracized, harassed, and stripped of credentials if they dare to pursue Itefa. Some have reported to have their lives threatened for doing so, creating fear among and compliance within the other women. There is a small community of Iyaonifas in the Cuban Lukumi community, however. Mar√≠a Cuesta Conde and Nidia Aguila de Le√≥n were the first Iyanifas initiated in Cuba by Victor Betancourt Estrada in March, 2000.El fen√≥meno Iy√≥nif√° en Cuba,‚Äù Consenso 1 (2005), available from www.consenso.org/01/articulos/02_01.shtml, internet; accessed 8 February 2006. Matanzas Babalawo Ernesto Acosta Cediez went on to initiate the Venezuelan lawyer, Alba Marina Portales, as an Iyanifa in 2002 with the help of Estrada.Mirta Fern√°ndez, ‚ÄúLas mujeres penetran en If√°,‚Äù El Caiman Barbudo 345, 14 March 2009 The following quote from Estrada explains his decision: \\"In the If√° room, initiation to the feminine orisha Od√∫, the mother of all living beings and the first woman diviner (she who married Or√∫nmila and had sixteen children who were converted into the sixteen Olod√∫ or major signs of If√°), is represented.\\" This demonstrates that to consecrate any diviner, masculine and feminine participation is required.Betancourt Estrada, ‚ÄúRespuestas a Felipe Ifal√°de,‚Äù 2 The If√° verse Oshe Tura requires that women and their power be recognized and specifically that it is forbidden to leave women out of religious activities. Oshun, a female Orisha who is featured in Oshe Tura, \\"encountered men who would not recognize her, so she established a sect of women called Iyami Aje to counterbalance the injustice. The male Orishas were rendered powerless, and were not effective until Oshun was included amongst their number. \\" See also *If√° *Babalawo *Iyami Aje References Bibliography Oyeronke Olajubu, Women in the Yoruba Religious Sphere Ayele Fa'seguntunde Kumari, Iyanifa:Woman of Wisdom Oluwo Olotunji Somorin, Women in the Yoruba Religion, Teledase Publishing, Ode Remo, Nigeria 2009 Category:Religious occupations Category:Iyalawos Category:Yoruba culture Category:Yoruba words and phrases ","title":"Iyalawo"},{"id":"44901478","text":"Sidh Gosti(Gurmukhi:‡®∏‡®ø‡®ß ‡®ó‡©ã‡®∏‡®ü‡®ø) is famous spiritual interfaith dialogue between Guru Nanak and Hindu Siddhas.

Biography  Tricaud got his interest in architecture from his uncle Pierre Prunet, who was Chief Architect for the Department of Historic Monuments. Prunet carried out restoration works on structures with important heritage, but his agency also designed many new projects. But his greatest satisfaction was to work on projects that combined the two. Tricaud's visits to Prunet's agency led to a strong interest in the art of building and an appreciation of a rigorous and restrained approach that he would subsequently refine while studying architecture under Roland Schweitzer. From this experience and his (dual) architectural training, Tricaud acquired the conviction that an informed project approach could only be based on a subtle marriage between architecture and engineering, both of which providing different yet complementary sources of creation in their relationship to reality. The result is an architecture aware of the uses to be made of the building and the identity of the setting, and an engineering based on the understanding and use of the laws of physics. In 1986, he met Jean-Marie Duthilleul who had recently joined the SNCF (French National Railways) to develop an architectural design policy for stations. They immediately realised that they shared the same approach to projects: a rational and contextual methodology with particular attention paid to the use and identity of the setting. The project for restructuring the Montparnasse station for which he was responsible served as an incubator, allowing them to form a team, an approach and an architectural vocabulary that they subsequently developed for the station programmes accompanying the TGV Atlantique, TGV M√©diterran√©e and TGV Est. AREP In 1997, Tricaud and Duthilleul founded AREP (, \\"Planning, Research, Interchange\\") in 1997, a company that brought together teams of architects and engineers. The experience acquired with AREP in the study of exchange hubs ‚Äì centres combining means of transport, movement and crowds of people ‚Äì proved to be adaptable to a number of different fields: public buildings, city spaces and complex urban programmes. Since AREP's foundation, the large number of projects carried out in other countries has allowed Tricaud to adapt his design approach to new contexts, especially through partnerships with other designers: Hadi Simaan in Doha, Carlos Zapata in Ho Chi Minh City, Cui Kai in Beijing, and Yves Feng in Shenzhen, among others.

She tells the following anecdote about her father, a deacon and teetotaler who worked as a merchant: > My father was very fond of his bees, and he and they were good friends. I > remember once he took me up with him to perform a curious little ceremony. > He had lost a cousin, and he told me he was going to inform the bees, and > they would say they were sorry.

Faced with their daughter's increasing desperation to learn how to read, Joseph and Rebecca allowed her to visit the pastor's daughter, Isabella, for basic lessons.

In 1866, after deciding to become a full-time writer, at the instigation of her Baptist pastor Jonathan Wittemore, founder of Christian World, she joined the staff of his publication. Hearn was to write for this publication for the rest of her life, her contributions forming the basis of nearly forty other works of poems, etc. These works were published under the nom de plume \\"Marianne Farningham,\\" a name derived from her birthplace and her forenames and suggested by Whittemore.Rosemary Mitchell, ‚ÄòHearn, Mary Anne [Marianne Farningham] (1834‚Äì1909)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 1 Jan 2015 She also wrote biographies of contemporary British heroes such as Grace Darling, David Livingstone, General Gordon and Queen Victoria under the name \\"Eva Hope.\\"Marianne Farningham, Linda Wilson, VictorianWeb In 1885, she became the editor of the Sunday School Times, which she had previously written for, drawing an annual sum of ¬£50.

Featherstone, an author frequently publishing works on Sunday Schools and Temperance Societies includes her in his lengthy \\"A Prologue to the Poets,\\" which references other English masters of verse from Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare and John Milton, to contemporary poets Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, John Keble, and Emma Tatham: \\"Then there's 'Darenth Vale with its 'Echoes' so sweet/ Come forth, Marianne, I've placed you a seat.\\"Featherstone, J.S. A Prologue to the Poets. Bromley, E. Strong, 1860, p. 7.  Hymns and social outreach  Farningham wrote a number of hymns of which \\"Just as I am, Thine Own to Be\\" is possibly the best remembered, although it is said to be a reworking of another hymn Just As I Am written by Charlotte Elliott in 1835.Just as I am, Thine own to be, Hymnology.co.uk, retrieved 1 January 2014 Passionate about education for the lower classes, she was acquainted with similarly minded female philanthropists Mary Carpenter and Frances Power Cobbe. In 1907, two years before her death, she wrote A Working Woman's Life, an autobiography (1907) at her friends' request. Her \\"Foreword\\" partially reads: \\"I have had frequent misgivings while writing this autobiography, for I know of no particular reason why it should have been written; and it has appeared very egotistic to do it...My hope is that it may be useful, especially to girls and women who are timid as to the years before them and the duties they have to face.

The film was released in Spain on 28 November 2014. Reewa Rathod makes her international debut with this film which has her composing one of the songs in the film, Tandaana. Plot The film begins in high drama as 6-year-old Mina (Vaibhavi Hankare) saves her newborn sister, Sita, from being drowned as an unwanted female, thereupon taking full responsibility for her care. But when their mother dies a few years later, their father hands them over to a woman from the city. Sita is left with nuns, despite her sister's frantic resistance, and young Mina is consigned to a brothel, from which she narrowly escapes. She finds work as a maid for a rich family, gaining an ally in Sanjay, the handsome son of the house. This melodramatic opener is suddenly revealed as a film-within-the-film, an autobiographical opus that Mina (Nandita Das), now a Bollywood superstar, is making with her director husband (the self-same Sanjay, now played by Subodh Maskara). The film marks the latest effort in Mina's unending 30-year search for her missing sister. Mina finally locates Sita in Barcelona and travels with Sanjay to be reunited with her. But little Sita has grown into a cold, remote scientist named Paula (Aina Clotet), who is totally unaware that she was even adopted, much less that she is of Indian descent. Flatly unreceptive, Paula angrily and summarily rejects Mina and her story. But a tense discussion with her adoptive parents and Mina's extensive documentation lead her to reluctantly entertain some curiosity about her roots and venture into an Indian video store. There, she meets Prakash (Naby Dakhli), who introduces her to her sister's films, and whose openness and quiet persistence, combined with Paula's sudden cinematic immersion in a vibrant culture, gradually wear down her defensiveness. Cast * Nandita Das as Mina * Aina Clotet as Paula * Naby Dakhli as Prakash * Vaibhavi Hankare as Young Mina * Subodh Maskara as Sanjay * Rosa Novell as Paula's Mother Music The score was composed by Zeltia Montes and Simon Smith, each composer dealing with different sections of the drama. The score was nominated for the Catalan Film Academy's Gaud√≠ award in 2015. The film won best picture at the same awards. The film also features several songs: \\"Far Away\\" by Anita Zengeza, \\"Vestida De Nit\\" by Silvia P√©rez Cruz, and Tandaana, especially composed for the film by the young composer and singer Reewa Rathod.

Malcolm J. Scoble combined it with Macrosoma in 1986. Distribution The species is recorded widely across the tropical South America: Colombia, Venezuela, French Guiana, across Brazil to Bel√©m at the mouth of the Amazon; south to the mid-west of Peru. Description Wings The wings are greyish brown in color. Forewing has white triangle on the costa. Hindwing is narrow translucent in the central area. The length of forewing can be 17‚Äì19 mm. Genitalia Male Following are the characteristics of the male genitalia: * Uncus is not notched in lateral view. * Gnathos has short, truncated lateral members. * The apex of the Valva is narrow with prominent inner lobe. Female The female genitalia has the following features: * The anal papillae is pointed. * Corpus bursae is globose; * Signum is a form of sclerotized, denticulate collar half encircling the neck of the corpus. Antenna The antenna is bipectinate in both sexes. Diagnosis M. heliconiaria is similar to M. semiermis, but the translucent area on the hindwing is less extensive, the ground color of the moth is more grey, and the apex of the forewing is not distinctly darker than the rest of the wing in terms of intensity. The shape of the gnathos and the presence of the lobe on the valva also distinguishes M. heliconiaria from M. semiermis, as does the globose corpus bursae with its collar like signum.

In other words, the cotangent sheaf is characterized by the universal property: there is the differential d: \\\\mathcal{O}_X \\\\to \\\\Omega_{X/S} such that any S-derivation D: \\\\mathcal{O}_X \\\\to F factors as D = \\\\alpha \\\\circ d with some \\\\alpha: \\\\Omega_{X/S} \\\\to F. In the case X and S are affine schemes, the above definition means that \\\\Omega_{X/S} is the module of K√§hler differentials. The standard way to construct a cotangent sheaf (e.g., Hartshorne, Ch II. ¬ß 8) is through a diagonal morphism (which amounts to gluing modules of K√§hler differentials on affine charts to get the globally-defined cotangent sheaf.) The dual module of the cotangent sheaf on a scheme X is called the tangent sheaf on X and is sometimes denoted by \\\\Theta_X.In concise terms, this means: :\\\\Theta_X \\\\overset{\\\\mathrm{def}} = \\\\mathcal{H}om_{\\\\mathcal{O}_X}(\\\\Omega_X, \\\\mathcal{O}_X) = \\\\mathcal{D}er(\\\\mathcal{O}_X). There are two important exact sequences: #If S ‚ÜíT is a morphism of schemes, then #:f^* \\\\Omega_{S/T} \\\\to \\\\Omega_{X/T} \\\\to \\\\Omega_{X/S} \\\\to 0. #If Z is a closed subscheme of X with ideal sheaf I, then #:I/I^2 \\\\to \\\\Omega_{X/S} \\\\otimes_{O_X} \\\\mathcal{O}_Z \\\\to \\\\Omega_{Z/S} \\\\to 0.https://mathoverflow.net/q/79956 as well as The cotangent sheaf is closely related to smoothness of a variety or scheme. For example, an algebraic variety is smooth of dimension n if and only if Œ©X is a locally free sheaf of rank n.  Construction through a diagonal morphism  Let f: X \\\\to S be a morphism of schemes as in the introduction and Œî: X ‚Üí X √óS X the diagonal morphism. Then the image of Œî is locally closed; i.e., closed in some open subset W of X √óS X (the image is closed if and only if f is separated). Let I be the ideal sheaf of Œî(X) in W. One then puts: :\\\\Omega_{X/S} = \\\\Delta^* (I/I^2) and checks this sheaf of modules satisfies the required universal property of a cotangent sheaf (Hartshorne, Ch II. Remark 8.9.2). The construction shows in particular that the cotangent sheaf is quasi-coherent. It is coherent if S is Noetherian and f is of finite type. The above definition means that the cotangent sheaf on X is the restriction to X of the conormal sheaf to the diagonal embedding of X over S. See also: bundle of principal parts.  Relation to a tautological line bundle  The cotangent sheaf on a projective space is related to the tautological line bundle O(-1) by the following exact sequence: writing \\\\mathbf{P}^n_R for the projective space over a ring R, :0 \\\\to \\\\Omega_{\\\\mathbf{P}^n_R/R} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbf{P}^n_R}(-1)^{\\\\oplus(n+1)} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbf{P}^n_R} \\\\to 0.

Drinfeld, Quantization of Hitchin‚Äôs integrable system and Hecke eigensheaves see also: ¬ß 3 of http://www.math.harvard.edu/~gaitsgde/grad_2009/SeminarNotes/Sept22(Dmodstack1).pdf There, the cotangent stack on an algebraic stack X is defined as the relative Spec of the symmetric algebra of the tangent sheaf on X.

He was born at Buntingford, Hertfordshire and died at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. His twin brother, Herbert Pigg, also played first-class cricket. Pigg was educated at Abington House School in Northampton and at Peterhouse, Cambridge. As a cricketer he was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm round-arm slow bowler. He matriculated at Cambridge University in the autumn of 1875, but in the 1876 season his only first-class cricket match was for an England XI against the university side: he scored one run and took one wicket. He played for the university team in a handful of matches in 1877, 1878 and 1879, but at a time when the team could call upon the services of players such as A. G. Steel, A. P. Lucas and Ivo Bligh, plus a smattering of Lytteltons, he did not warrant a regular place and he was not picked for any of the University Matches against Oxford University. Pigg graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1879; this converted to a Master of Arts in 1887. He became a schoolmaster at Blair Lodge School in Scotland for four years before taking up private tutoring, initially in St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex. From 1892 to 1922, he was a private tutor in Cambridge, coaching the duller students through the rigours of Cambridge exams and, according to a reminiscence in The Times at his death, a much-loved and respected character. \\"I should doubt whether any coach ever had pupils more numerous, more idle, and, on the whole, more pleasant,\\" wrote a correspondent calling himself \\"B. D.\\". \\"They loved him; they confided in him as to their adventures; they called him Charles; and they all felt for him complete respect as well as affection.\\" Pigg resumed his intermittent first-class cricket career from 1886 with occasional matches for MCC, many of them against Cambridge University, and for other amateur teams. His highest first-class score came in 1890 when he captained MCC against Cambridge at Fenner's and scored 48; he never took more than one wicket in an innings with his occasional bowling. From the mid 1890s he played regularly for Hertfordshire in the Minor Counties competition and from 1903 to 1911 he likewise appeared in Minor Counties games for Cambridgeshire, often acting as captain and sometimes with his sons, Charles and Bernard, playing alongside him. In addition to his cricket activities, he was also a keen golfer and was instrumental in securing permanent facilities for the Cambridge University Golf Club at a course near Newmarket. He retired to Cheltenham but had been present at the winter meeting of the golf club a month before his death.

Background and chart success Released in the US in 1967 on the Laurie label, in the UK in the 1970s, \\"I'm on My Way\\" came to the attention of Russ Winstanley, a disc jockey at the Wigan Casino. He began playing the record and it became one of the more popular records at the venue. It was re-released in 1975 on the UK Records label and was the last record to be played every week at the Wigan Casino. The single reached number 38 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1975. Wigan Casino's spin-off record label Casino Classics re-released it on the Three Before Eight EP in 1978 and Casino Classics: Chapter One compilation in 1979.

Unlike other faj√£s, Mero is situated at the top of asteep cliff, over the Faj√£ Ch√£. Mero is served by watercourses annually, with permanent ravines and Sete Fontes spring proving potable water. The spring was also captured by the municipality of Calheta in order to serve the communities of Norte Pequeno, Calheta and Ribera Seca, inaugurated by President Jo√£o Amaral on 17 July 1991. The path from Faj√£ da Penedia crosses natural vegetation, with many plants typical of endemic Macronesian flora, while providing picturesque views between sugarcane and Azorean juniper. Bird species in this area are limited to migratory and marine birds such as seagulls and shearwater, while the rocky beach also permits the capture of some fish. While at one time the area was inhabited constantly by a few tenant farmers, today the region is mostly abandoned, were a few agricultural activities still occur, owing to the difficult descent/ascent. The area was used to cultivate fava beans, grapes, potato, squash and local tarot, which was abundant in the margins of the ravine.

Vehicles *In 2010, Nissan has developed a GPS-enabled warning system to alert drivers travelling in the wrong direction on motorways. The first application is the Nissan Fuga hybrid luxury sedan. The system, uses GPS positioning data, map data and vehicle speed data to determine if the vehicle is travelling against the flow of traffic. The system identifies an area for determining the normal direction of flow, such as around junctions. When the vehicle passes through that area, the system records its direction of travel. If the vehicle enters that area again and the system determines that it's driving in the opposite direction it provides audible and visual warnings. *2011 Toyota introduced Wrong-Way Driving Alert incorporated into navigation systems (only in Japan). Gives on-screen and voice alerts to wrong-way drivers. The function monitors vehicle direction on highways and selected toll roads, including at tollgates, service area ramps, turn-offs and junctions. The new function was made possible by advances in communications-based map-updating technology and in pinpoint position- recognition technology that uses information from GPS, gyro1, vehicle-speed and other sensors to determine accurate vehicle movement. *In 2013 Mercedes- Benz introduced wrong-way driver warning function on the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222) and the facelift Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W212).

Formation On March 25, 1815, the mobile corps of the Kingdom of the Netherlands received its organizational details. The infantry of the army was divided into three divisions, each of them divided into two brigades. The 1st division was commanded by General Stedman, the 3rd by General Chass√©. The 2nd Division was to be commanded by General Perponcher, who was then Minister of the Netherlands in Berlin. His first brigade was placed under the orders of Colonel Bylandt. The brigade was the 1st Brigade of the 2nd Dutch Division (Baron de Perponcher-Sedlnitzky's) of the Anglo-allied I Corps (Prince of Orange's) in the Duke of Wellington's Anglo-allied army. On April 8, Colonel van Zuylen was appointed chief of staff. At the start of the Waterloo Campaign, the Brigade as part of the I Corps was cantoned to the south-east of Brussels. The brigade consisted of: * 27th Light Battalion (Bataljon Jagers, 550 men), commanded by Lieutenant Colonel J.W. Grunebosch * Dutch 7th Infantry Battalion (701 men), commanded by Lieutenant Colonel F.C. van den Sande * Dutch 5th National Militia Battalion (220 men), commanded by Lieutenant ColonelJ.J.Westenberg * Dutch 7th National Militia Battalion (675 men), commanded by Lieutenant Colonel H. Singendonck * Dutch 8th National Militia Battalion (566 men), commanded by Lieutenant Colonel W.A. de Jongh. Waterloo Campaign The brigade fought in both the Battle of Quatre Bras and the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815 against the French Army of the North commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte. On 15 June Nassau units of the 2nd Brigade were engaged by the vanguard of the French army's left wing; which developed into the Battle of Quatre Bras where the Brigade van Bylandt played a major role during the morning and early afternoon of 16 June 1815. As a consequence of their prolonged involvement in combat, the van Bylandt Brigade ended the engagement as the most battered and decimated unit among the Allies. After the battle the Anglo-allied army deployed at the escarpment near Mont-Saint-Jean. The Brigade van Bylandt was placed in front of Picton's division in an advanced position at the Battle of Waterloo. There has never been provided a satisfactory explanation, why this brigade was deployed in such a manner, that it was permanently exposed to French artillery fire. On the part of Wellington it was legitimate to be wary of the loyalty of the Belgian and Dutch troops, as some had fought in the ranks of the French army and the Swiss General Rebecque had disobeyed a direct order from Wellington at Quatre Bras. However, most of the non-British contingents of the Anglo-Allied had been placed in front-line positions, while the British units had deployed in the second line - relatively save from artillery - beyond the Mont St. Jean ridge. Many British historians and authors have repeatedly criticized the Dutch, Belgian and German troops for their, in opposition to the British contingents, low morale, shameful conduct in combat and even cowardice, generally based on the reports of British officers, such as Kennedy. The alleged retreat of parts of the van Bylandt's Brigade upon the French infantry attack at La Haye Sainte has been particularly condemned. However authors from other backgrounds have concluded, that with regard to their already weakened condition, Wellington's mistrust and the local isolation and exposure, these men fought indeed valiantly. Napoleon himself had observed...that heroic determination of the Prince of Orange as to be an essential force of conquest. At around 1:30 p.m. four infantry divisions of d'Erlon's I Corps advanced towards Picton's division and attacked the brigades of van Bylandt and Pack. Supported by massive artillery fire the French divisions of Donzelot and Marcognet drove right into the Dutch and Belgian defenders. As some troops were forced to fall back, the brigades stood their ground and stopped the French advance. Van Bylandt, van Zuylen and most of the division's commanders were wounded and the eventual counterattack was executed under the command of Captain Bast. After the Battle of Waterloo the Allied army marched on Paris, where Emperor Bonaparte would eventually abdicate which finally ended a 25-year period of war.

She went on to serve in public relations and communications positions from the inception, as well as during the ongoing operations, of such major Canadian arts activities as the Charlottetown Festival, the World Festival of Expo '67, the National Arts Centre, the Canada Council, the National Ballet of Canada, the O'Keefe Centre, the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts in Toronto and the Ontario Arts Council. Honours Jolliffe was appointed as a Member of the Order of Canada in 1985 and received the Silver Ticket Award in 1988. The Mary Jolliffe Fund was established by the Ontario Arts Foundation in her honour as an arts publicist.

The station was opened in 1864 by the North Staffordshire Railway on the company's Biddulph Valley Line. The line had opened in 1860 and was primarily concerned with mineral traffic, mostly coal and ironstone from the collieries and ironworks along the Biddulph Valley. Passenger services were of a much lesser interest to the NSR so it was not until a few years later that a number of stations were opened supported by an infrequent number of passenger trains. Passenger traffic was never intensive and by 1922 all the places along the valley were better served by bus services. Consequently, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway withdrew the passenger services in 1927. Faciliites for goods traffic remained until 1964.

Formation The 7th originated from the 2de Regiment \\"Vlaanderen\\" of the Belgisch Legioen. The Battalion was stationed in Ghent where it would also receive its colours. A lot of officers, Non- commissioned officers and men were veterans of the Grande Arm√©e of Napoleon Bonaparte. Waterloo Campaign The 7th played an important role in both the Battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte was finally defeated by the Anglo-allied army commanded by the Duke of Wellington and the Prussians under Prince Blucher. As a part of the 1st \\"Brigade van Bylandt\\" the Battalion first saw action at Quatre Bras on 16 June 1815, to counter the advance of the French Army. Two days later, on 18 June, during the Battle of Waterloo it had to endure the first massive attack by the French I Corps commanded by d'Erlon. When the Brigade had to withdraw through sheer weight of numbers, the 7th was able to hold up the French I Corps long enough for the neighbouring British 8th and 9th brigades to move in to fill the gaps. Even though the entire Brigade van Bylandt received heavy losses, they would remain in place for the entire battle. After the Battle of Waterloo the Wellington's Anglo-allied army, including the 7th, moved onto Paris. Merger After the occupation the Battalion returned to the Southern Netherlands. In December 1815 it would be merged with 3 Battalions of Nationale Militie (30, 31 and 32) into the 6de Afdeeling Infanterie.

They entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1885‚Äì86, were founder members of the Northern League in 1889, turned professional in 1908 and joined the North Eastern League, which they won in 1913 and 1921. The latter win preceded election to the Football League as members of its newly formed Third Division North. Runners-up in their first season, Darlington were Northern Section champions three years later, thus winning promotion to the Second Division. Their 15th-place finish in 1926 remains their best League performance, and they were relegated back to the Third Division the following year. After 68 years of continuous membership, they were relegated from the Football League in 1988‚Äì89. Having made an immediate return as Conference champions, they remained in the League until 2010, when they again dropped into the Conference. After Darlington failed to exit administration in a manner acceptable to the Football Association, that body treated it as a new club, required it to change its name (to Darlington 1883), and placed its team in the Northern League, the ninth tier of English football, for the 2012‚Äì13 season. Five years later, the FA approved the club's request to resume its traditional name. The club's first team have competed in numerous nationally organised competitions, and all players who have played in between 25 and 99 such matches, either as a member of the starting eleven or as a substitute, are listed below. Each player's details include the duration of his Darlington career, his typical playing position while with the club, and the number of games played and goals scored in domestic league matches and in all senior competitive matches. Where applicable, the list also includes the national team for which the player was selected, and the number of senior international caps he won.  Introduction  Of the more than 350 men who made 25 career appearances for Darlington in national competitions but fell short of the 100 mark, several hold club records. Jason de Vos was the first to play senior international football while a Darlington player, and Franz Burgmeier made most senior international appearances, with seven for Liechtenstein during the 2008‚Äì09 season. At 15 years 318 days, Curtis Main became Darlington's youngest Football League debutant when he entered the League Two visit to Peterborough United on 3 May 2008 as a second-half substitute. The sale of de Vos to Dundee United for ¬£400,000 in 1998 generated the club's record transfer fee received, and the record for fee paid, of ¬£100,000, was set in 2006 when Julian Joachim was signed from Boston United and equalled the following year with the purchase of Pawel Abbott from Swansea City. Others made an important contribution to the club despite relatively few appearances in national competition. Dick Healey's career was coming to an end by the time the club was elected to the Football League, but he was their top scorer with 41 goals as they won the North- Eastern League title in 1913 and captained the club to their second title in 1921, as well as scoring four goals in as many matches for the England amateur team and representing the Amateur XI in the 1913 FA Charity Shield.For 41 goals: For 1921: For Amateur XI: For Charity Shield: Dick Jackson played in 26 FA Cup matches while player- manager of Darlington either side of the First World War, and George Browna former England international and three-time League winner with Huddersfield Townhad a spell as player-manager in the 1930s. Lol Morgan, Mick Tait and Martin Gray went on to manage the club: Morgan managed the team to promotion from the Fourth Division in 1965‚Äì66, and Gray led the team to three promotions in four seasons after taking over as manager in 2012. Marco Gabbiadini was the only player with fewer than 100 League appearances to be voted by supporters into a \\"Dream Team\\" as part of the 2003 Farewell to Feethams celebrations (when the club left their long-time home). Other players took part in significant matches in the history of the club. Tommy Barbour, Percy Sutcliffe, Alf Dolphin and Arthur Wolstenholme played in Darlington's first match in the Football League, a 2‚Äì0 win at home to Halifax Town on 27 August 1921. Tommy Moran scored twice and created two other goals, one for Ron Harbertson, as Darlington eliminated Chelsea, League champions only three seasons earlier, in the fourth round of the 1957‚Äì58 FA Cup to progress to the last 16 of the competition for only the second time in their history. Gary Coatsworth scored the goal that confirmed Darlington as winners of the 1989‚Äì90 Football Conference title. John McReady, Gary Smith and Michael Smith played in Darlington's last match in the Football League, against Dagenham & Redbridge on 8 May 2010. After Tommy Wright struck the bar in the 120th minute of the 2011 FA Trophy Final, substitute Chris Senior was first to the rebound to head Darlington's winning goal. Jamie Chandler was man of the match, and the team included seven other men listed here. Still others earned their notability elsewhere. In Jack Beby's time as manager of AEKthe club's website dubs him the \\"great reformer\\"he led the team to successive victories in the Greek Cup in 1949 and 1950. Tom Burlison was an active trade unionist who became deputy general secretary of the GMB, treasurer of the Labour Party and, as Baron Burlison of Rowlands Gill, was the first former professional footballer to enter the House of Lords, where he was a Government whip.

Biography His father gave him the government of Hisar and Termez in 1459 (according to Babur Astarabad), but lost to Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqara according Babur gave two major battles: at Astarabad, where he was defeated and Chikman (Sarai) near Andikhud equally defeated, around 1465, returning to Herat. His father restored in 1466. His father made an expedition to the Azerbaijan in 1468, but was defeated in the winter of 1468 to 1469 and was taken prisoner and was executed on 5 February 1469. Sultan Mahmud left his government to Herat with the support of Qambar Ali Beg, Governor of Hisar, who had accompanied Abu Sa'id had returned to Iraq; Mahmud came to this city with an army on 16 March but approaching Prince Hussain Baykara, another branch of the Timurid, with the help of the Uzbeks, had to remove it and Baykara Sultan proclaimed the 24th of March 1469. Sultan Ahmad Mirza, who ruled in Samarkand where he was and had been proclaimed sultan brother (father and mother) of Sultan Mahmud, marched from the capital determined to reconquer Herat, but after an interview with his brother Mahmoud, who had arrived in Samarkand, withdrew. Then Amir Khusraw and Qambar Ali Shah, with the consent of Sultan Mirza Ahmad, took him to Hisar to rule there and later dominated the territories south of Quhqa (Quhlugha) and mountains to the Hindu Kohtin Kush Range, including Termez, Caghaniyan, Hisan, Khuttalan, Kunduz and Badakhshan. In 1470 Sultan Mahmud Mirza of Hisar and Umar Shaikh Mirza II of Andijan (Fergana) allied to attack Samarkand but through the mediation of a religious leader they have agreed to make peace. 1471 the hakim of Balkh, Ahmad Mushtak (or Mushtaq), known as Khoja Ahrar, revolted and Mirza Mahmud was going to support Balkh in person. Hussain Baykara besieged Balkh for four months. It is not known when Baykara recovered Balkh. In 1479 he killed his brother Mirza Abu Bakr, and took control of Badakhshan, Kunduz, Khuttalan and Caghaniyan. Upon the death of his brother Sultan Ahmad Mirza of Samarkand in the middle of July 1494, less than two difference in the death of another brother Umar Shaikh Mirza of Andijan and Ferghana Valley (8 June 1494), Mirza Mahmud was presented to Samarkand and proclaimed sultan. It was well known that there was no living children Ahmad Mirza either because they were too young, and ruled six months, dying of disease then in January 1495 at age 43 (within eight months died three brothers). According Baber was twice Kafiristan, south of Badakhshan, and made holy war and this was called Sultan Mahmud Ghazi. The emirs began to dispute the power to the middle of the sons of princes Umar Shaikh Mirza, including Babur, founder of the Mughal Empire, and the children of Mirza Mahmud. Death and aftermath Sultan Mahmud Mirza died in 1495. His son Mirza Baysoonkar, ascended the throne at Samarkand.

It is located about four kilometres north of Pfronten in the county of Ostallg√§u. The late mediaeval hilltop castle was abandoned during the Thirty Years‚Äô War and set on fire. From 1995 to 2006 the former aristocratic seat was comprehensively made safe and conserved as part of a closely observed \\"example of renovation\\".  Location  The ruins are situated at on a twin-topped, rocky ridge in front of the Tannheim Mountains. In the local vicinity there are many other castles, ruins, castle sites and fortresses on either side of the Austro-German border, including the famous Neuschwanstein Castle.  History  The castle was one of the last great castles of the German Middle Ages. Its lord based it consciously on the ‚Äì actually anachronistic ‚Äì design of a high medieval hill castle whilst, in other places, the first castles had been abandoned or converted into schloss-like country houses. Construction on the fortress was started in 1418 by Frederick of Freyberg zu Eisenberg, the eldest son of the eponymous lord of Eisenberg Castle. The work lasted until 1432, the funding coming from the income of the little barony that surrounded it, which the lord had bequeathed in advance of his death. The walls of the inner bailey with its bergfried-like main tower and large sections of the walls of the outer bailey go back to this first construction phase. The first castle gave the impression of a high medieval hilltop castle about 200 years older with an impressive bergfried and two palases. At a time when the nobility were waning and the bourgeois classes were in the ascendancy, Frederick of Freyberg clearly wanted to create a symbol of unbroken aristocratic power. He certainly was certainly influenced by the size and appearance of his ancestral castle which was only a five-minute walk away. The construction and huge maintenance costs forced his sons, George and Frederick of Freyberg-Eisenberg zu Hohenfreyberg, and their cousin, George of Freyberg-Eisenberg zu Eisenberg, who also owned estates of the Barony of Hohenfreyberg, to sell the castle in 1484 to Archduke Sigmund of Austria; they also lacked a male heir. The successor to the Archduke, later Emperor Maximilian I, enfeoffed Hohenfreyberg in 1499Tyrolean Provincial Archives, Kopialb√ºcher 20-22 TTT, fol. 40-42 to Augsburg merchant, Georg Gossembrot, the Pfleger of the nearby Tyrolean castle of Ehrenberg. He invested heavily in the fortress: the site was fortified militarily and modernised. Gossembrot married his daughter Sibylle to Lutz of Freyberg zu √ñpfingen-Justingen, a relative of the Freybergs at the neighbouring castle of Eisenberg. In 1502 Gossembrot died and his widow, Radegunda Eggenberger, gave the fief of Hohenfreyberg back to Austria in an agreement dated 9 May 1513. She stated her late husband had spent 17,000 to 18,000 florins for its purchase and construction.Tyrolean Provincial Archives, Innsbruck, Document I 915 The modernization of the fortifications by the castle's vassal lords paid off in 1525 during the German Peasants' War. The Austrian Pfleger was able to ward the rebels off successfully after he had requested reinforcements and soldiers (Kriegsknechte) from Innsbruck. In 1646, towards the end of the Thirty Years' War, the Austrian outposts of Hohenfreyberg, Eisenberg and Falkenstein were set on fire on the orders of the Tyrolean state government. The fortresses were not to fall intact into the hands of the approaching Protestants. However, the attackers changed their line of advance, so their destruction was needless. Since that time, all three castles have remained uninhabited ruins. After the Battle of Austerlitz, Austria had to cede its Allg√§u possessions to Bavaria. The Kingdom of Bavaria sold Hohenfreyberg in 1841 back to the Lords of Freyberg, to whom the castle still belongs today. In 1995, an extensive renovation started on the castle which had hitherto been left to decay unhindered. The Alp Action Foundation under the patronage of Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan enabled the start of the safety work that ended in 2006 for financial reasons. The aim of these measures was a historically faithful preservation of the state at the start of restoration, additions and larger archaeological intervention was excluded. The internationally acclaimed \\"conservation example\\" is a role model for similarly innovative historical monument projects across Europe. As part of the expansion of the Allg√§u Castle Region, in 2004 two educational displays and several information boards were put up at the castle. The planning concept of the Allg√§u Castle Region is an extension of the cross-border East Allg√§u-Au√üerfern Castle Region, which includes the spectacular fortress ensemble at Ehrenberg Castle near Reutte in Tyrol's Au√üerfern. Current owner is Baron Ernst von Freyberg - Eisenberg.  Construction phases  Information board by the entrance with details of the dates of construction zwinger with its flanking tower The large battery tower in the southwest (outer bailey) Educational motif of an arquebusier in the northwest of the outer bailey The castle was built mainly in three large construction phases. The original castle (1418‚Äì32) was somewhat smaller than the surviving ruins. It consisted of two angled residential buildings in the courtyard, a bergfried-like main tower in the east and a chapel tower. This inner bailey was surrounded by a short enceinte. The crenellated wall of the outer bailey was much lower than today. On the plateau of this outer ward were almost certainly a number of wooden domestic and residential buildings. The original gate of the outer ward was slightly wider, but situated on the same spot as the present entrance. Originally the castle track led around the north and east sides of the castle and met the one coming from the gate in the outer bailey. The gate of the inner ward was originally in the south wall. The outer wall guarded the main entrance in the manner of a gateway zwinger. In 1456 the two gateways were reinforced. On the west side of the inner bailey a low artillery hut was built, from which an attacking enemy could be fired upon with light firearms. The main gate was expanded into a massive gateway structure. Between 1486 and 1502 the castle was fundamentally remodelled and strengthened. At the southwest corner of the outer ward the mighty artillery roundel was built. The height of the enceinte was increased and designed with embrasures for arquebuses. The large battery tower guarded the new approach way, which was now on the southern side. The gateway to the inner bailey was moved to the west side and was given a new gate tower. This required the demolition of the northern half of the great west residence or palas, whose rubble was distributed to a depty of a metre in the inner courtyard. As a consequence even the smaller palas had to be remodelled. To the north and east the mighty zwinger systems were built with a semi-circular flanking tower in the far northeast.  Description  The main castle and inner gateway Access to the castle site today is through the gate in the outer bailey on the western side. The gate and enceinte belong to the first phase of construction (1418/32). To the right rises a mighty artillery roundel (built in 1501, but later increased in height), that was added under Gossembrot. After about 30 metres the main gate of the inner bailey is reached, in front of which wings were later added. The original entranceway was, however, in the middle of the southern side. Here, there is a gateway in front, which was subsequently converted into a cistern tower. Nessler claims wrongly that this gateway is the remnant of the bergfried. This gateway/tower lost its function when the castle entrance was moved under Gossembrot from the north to the south side of the castle and guarded by the aforementioned artillery roundel. The impressive zwinger system was built around the castle in 1486 under the vassal lord, Gossembrot. Around 1540, the western front of the inner bailey was reinforced by an artillery platform. The conception of this castle element was based on Albrecht D√ºrer's 1527 tractate, \\"Some Lessons in Fortifying the City, Palace and Town\\" (\\"Ettliche underricht zu befestigung der Stett, Schlo√ü und flecken\\"). The gun platform was made accessible again during the general renovation of the castle. The neighbouring castle of Eisenberg was also strengthened in the 16th century on the recommendations of D√ºrer. Two domestic buildings stood in the castle courtyard, which were joined together forming an angle with one another. The square walls of the smaller one have partially survived, the outer wall of the larger building was also the enceinte of the original castle, but the east wall has disappeared. At the southwest corner the round, vaulted, chapel tower has survived. The bergfried forms the eastern enclosure of the inner bailey with its balcony in front. The zwinger wall makes an acute angle around the eastern end of the inner bailey. In the northeast of the zwinger a round defensive tower rises from the line of the wall. The whole castle was built of limestone blocks. The construction material came from several small quarries in the immediate and near vicinity of the castle. Together with the surrounding palaces and fortifications the site offers an overview of the history of mediaeval fortifications over the last thousand years in what is known as the East Allg√§u-Au√üerfern Castle Region (Burgregion Ostallg√§u-Au√üerfern). Numerous artefacts from Hohenfreyberg Castle are on display in the castle museum in the village of Eisenberg-Zell.

Career Club career Borisov came through the youth system of Loko Sofia and made his A PFG debut on 25 April 1991, in the railwaymen's 3:0 home win over Chernomorets Burgas, impressing with his performance. In the summer of 1997, he was signed by Levski Sofia on the insistence of coach Stefan Grozdanov and manager & player's agent Andrey Zhelyazkov. Notable highlights during his stay with the \\"bluemen\\" included a strong performance in the 1998 Bulgarian Cup Final against archrivals CSKA Sofia, which Levski Sofia won by a score of 5:0, as well as the netting of three goals in the 8:1 rout against Belarusian side Lokomotiv-96 Vitebsk on 13 August 1998 (the second largest margin of victory in European club tournaments for the team) in a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup match. He is the second Levski Sofia player (after legend Nikola Kotkov) to score a hat-trick for the team in European competitions. However, shortly after that he returned to Loko Sofia and his career began to stagnate, with the footballer never reaching his previous heights. Borisov subsequently had a stint in Israel (first moving to the country in 2000) with Bnei Sakhnin and Hapoel Ramat Gan. He then played for Loko Sofia, Dorostol Silistra, Balkan Botevgrad, and Minyor Pernik before retiring. After the end of his playing career, Borisov studied to become a manager in Dimitar Penev's coaching school between 2007 and 2008, and also took a number of other jobs outside of sports. His current focus is his own private footballing school \\"Ferion\\", where he works with the children. Borisov is regarded as a very talented footballer who fell short of fulfilling his full potential. International career He made his debut for Bulgaria on 12 April 1995, in the 0:0 away draw with Macedonia in a friendly match.

She was honoured at a 2012 gathering in Ledo by the Assam Sahitya Sabha (Assam Literary Society). Deka promoted Assamese heritage, traditional customs, weaving and fabric art, cooking and folk music with her husband, Bhabananda Deka.

Deka was the first female editor and publisher of a children's magazine, Phul (Flower), and wrote 30 critically praised books. All India Radio broadcast Deka's radio plays on issues related to women and children. According to the Assam Tribune, Deka has \\"been like an institution to our society\\" and \\"has contributed immensely to the cultural and economic spheres of our state\\". Dainik Sankarjyoti, an Assamese daily published in Guwahati, described how she played a significant part in nurturing the traditional indigenous Assamese lifestyle and social ethos by promoting indigenous Assamese weaving traditions (maintaining taat xaal‚Äîhand looms for weaving mekhela sadawr and suriya chapkawn) and dheki (traditional Assamese crop grinders for rice and pithaguri. Deka died on 15 June 2014 in Guwahati. ChaiTunes released a music video as a tribute. Traditional Assamese lifestyle A poet, Deka inculcated the legacy of Assamese culture and heritage in her children. She set up an indigenous Assamese traditional hand loom (taat-xaal ) at her homes in New Delhi and Guwahati to produce hand-woven fabrics and garments. Deka wore her hand-woven mekhela-sadawr and wove suriya- sapkawns for her husband to wear. She set up a crop-grinding tool (dheki ) at home, using it to producing her family‚Äôs food from organic herbs. Raw paddy, including rice, wheat and lentils, was ground to produce traditional Assamese food and snacks such as saul, kumawl saul, bora saul, sira, aakhoi and xandawh. Deka demonstrated self-reliance, even in the city. Author Deka wrote and edited a total of 30 books, mostly in Assamese. Some of her writing, including short stories, have been translated into English. Deka's books have been reviewed by Maheswar Neog, Bhupen Hazarika, Pramod Chandra Bhattacharya, Sheelabhadra, Rammal Thakuria, Bhabananda Deka, Bisweswar Hazarika and Kanak Chandra Deka. She had a cordial relationship with Bhupen Hazarika and Mamoni Raisom Goswami (Indira Goswami), and Hazarika wrote an article about one of her books. A compilation by Deka and her husband entitled Sahityik Dampati Adhyaksha Bhabananda Deka‚ÄìNalini Prava Deka was introduced on 4 December 2014 in Guwahati. Another book (An Extraordinary Assamese Couple, about Deka and her husband) was introduced on 28 February 2015 by Dutch scientist and author Constantin Aurel Stere. She wrote three short-story collections, including 2011's Elandhu (Smut, with some English-language stories) and Ebigha Mati (A Plot of Land) (1990). Deka's short stories emphasized brotherhood and religious tolerance. Many of her poems were played and sung by Assamese musicians and singers. Deka began editing a popular children's magazine, Phul (Flower), in 1987 and printed and published the magazine for several years on her own printing press. Playwright Deka was a popular Assamese first- generation female radio playwright in Assam since the early 1970s. Her plays centered around issues concerning women and children, and many were broadcast on All India Radio from Guwahati. Deka acted in some of her radio plays and onstage.

Also a novelist, Taylor is the Professor of Christian Origins and Second Temple Judaism at King's College, London. She identifies as a Quaker. Early life and education Joan Elizabeth Taylor was born in Horsell, Surrey, England, on 13 September 1958. Her parents are Robert Glenville and Birgit Elisabeth (Norlev) Taylor. Her ancestry is English and Danish. In 1967, her family emigrated to New Zealand, where she grew up, attending school in Newlands and Lower Hutt. After a BA degree at Auckland University, New Zealand. Joan completed a three-year postgraduate degree in Divinity at the University of Otago, and then went to the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem (Kenyon Institute) as Annual Scholar in 1986. She undertook a PhD in early Christian archaeology and Jewish-Christianity at New College, Edinburgh University, as a Commonwealth Scholar. Career In 1990, she accompanied her husband, human rights lawyer Paul Hunt, to Geneva and then to Gambia, returning to New Zealand in 1992. She was lecturer, subsequently senior lecturer, at the University of Waikato, New Zealand, in the departments of both Religious Studies and History. In 1995 she won an Irene Levi-Sala prize in archaeology for the book version of her PhD thesis, Christians and the Holy Places (Oxford: Clarendon, 1993, rev. 2003). In 1996-7 she was Visiting Lecturer and Research Associate in Women's Studies in New Testament at Harvard Divinity School, a position she held in association with a Fulbright Award. She joined the staff of King's College London, Department of Theology and Religious Studies, in 2009, and in 2012 became Professor of Christian Origins and Second Temple Judaism. Research The Therapeutae Taylor travelled to Egypt in 1999 to research the area surrounding Lake Mareotis where the Therapeutae lived according to Philo of Alexandria.Contemp. III.21 Later, she published her archaeological findings beside her textual analysis of Philo's De Vita Contemplativa in her Jewish Women Philosophers of First-Century Alexandria: Philo's 'Therapeutae' Reconsidered. Taylor challenged the belief that the Therapeutae was an Essenic community Cf. Emil Sch√ºrer, 1979, A History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ, Bloomsbury Publishing PLC and showed that the Mareotic community belonged to the Alexandrian milieu with its Jewish Diaspora community. She argued that the best historical context to Philo's Contemp. is the bitter hostilities between the Jews and the Greeks of Alexandria.Taylor (2003:53) She also managed to discover the location of the community at a low hill, in the ridge which was called \\"the Strip.\\"Taylor (2003:81) Her findings were welcomed in scholarship.Adam Kamesar, The Classical Review, Vol. 55, No. 2 (Oct., 2005), pp. 596-597. See also Jorunn Okland, Journal of Biblical Literature, Vol. 124, No. 2 (Summer, 2005), pp. 378-381 Pieter W. van der Horst found her discovery and analysis thorough and convincing, which makes a shift in our understanding of the context of this group.Gnomon, 76. Bd., H. 7 (2004), pp. 634-635 The prominent Second Temple scholar John J. Collins also accepted the \\"richly documented\\" conclusions of Taylor.Dead Sea Discoveries, Vol. 12, No. 2 (2005), pp. 220-223 Yet, he shared van der Horst's reluctance to agree with Taylor's suggestion that the Therapeutae were associated with the extreme allegorizers in Philo's (Migr.Ab. 89-93) due to Philo's sympathy toward the Therapeutae. Her study also proposed a new view of first century Jewish women since the Therapeutrides (ŒòŒµœÅŒ±œÄŒµœÖœÑœÅŒØŒ¥ŒµœÇ) were highly educated philosophers. This view further supported the contribution of feminist observations to historical investigation, according to Annewies van den Hoek of Harvard Divinity School.The Journal of Religion, Vol. 86, No. 1 (January 2006), pp. 146-149 John the Baptist Taylor's ground-breaking work on John the Baptist situated John within the context of Second Temple Judaism and argued that his baptism should be understood in line with forms of immersion for ritual purity known at the time.Taylor, J. E., 1997, The Immerser: John the Baptist Within Second Temple Judaism, London: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company John's baptism rid the body of ritual impurity after the inner being had been cleansed by repentance, action and forgiveness, preparing people for the eschatological arrival of a coming figure. In her careful analysis of issues surrounding the traditions of the Baptist like purification, she showed that John's baptism should not be understood through the duality of outer symbolism and inner repentance, as John Dominic Crossan stated earlier, but outer and inner purity.Taylor, J. E., 1997, The Immerser: John the Baptist Within Second Temple Judaism, London: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, p. 69 The significance of the book, as Bruce Chilton puts it, is in treating the tradition of the Baptist in its own historical context, not under the shadow of New Testament Christology.Reviewed Work: The Immerser: John the Baptist within Second Temple Judaism by Joan E. Taylor, The Jewish Quarterly Review Vol. 90, No. 3/4 (Jan. - Apr., 2000), pp. 447-450 Her analysis instilled scholarly debates of the relationship between Qumran and John the Baptist as well as formative Christianity with a spectrum of opinions over her findings.See James H. Charlesworth review: Dead Sea Discoveries Vol. 8, No. 2, Qumran and Rabbinic Judaism (2001), pp. 208-211. See also Paula Fredriksen Journal of Jewish Studies 50.1 (1999) 160-161 Archaeology Since her PhD and early work on the archaeology of Christian holy sites, Taylor has ranged from studying the archaeology of the goddess Asherah to questions of archaeology and historical geography (in Eusebius' Onomasticon, and particularly to the excavations of Qumran and the Qumran Caves, particularly contributing to discussion of the relationship between literary and archaeological evidence for understanding the past (in On Pliny, the Essene Location and Kh. Qumran). Literature Joan Taylor is a writer of narrative history, novels and poetry (sometimes using her mother's maiden name of Norlev). Her first novel, Conversations with Mr. Prain, was published by Melville House Publishing in Brooklyn, New York, and Hardie Grant in Melbourne, in 2006, and republished by Melville House. Her second novel, kissing Bowie, was published by Seventh Rainbow, London, in 2013. In 2016 her historical novel Napoleon's Willow appeared. Jesus and Brian  Taylor organised an international conference focusing on the new hermeneutic of reception exegesis, by considering the historical Jesus through the lens of Monty Python‚Äôs Life of Brian in June 2014, involving the participation of John Cleese and Terry Jones, who were interviewed as part of the event. The papers are published in a book edited by Taylor, Jesus and Brian: Exploring the Historical Jesus and his Times via Monty Python's Life of Brian.  What Did Jesus Look Like?  Taylor‚Äôs book What Did Jesus Look Like? (Bloomsbury PublishingT&T; Clark, 2018) received considerable media interest on its release. In seeking to understand the appearance of Jesus, Taylor scoured western art and relics, memories and traditions, and ultimately relied on early texts and archaeology to create a visualisation of Jesus that she considered more authentic. In this reconstruction, she stresses that Jesus was not only a Jewish man of Middle Eastern appearance, with ‚Äòolive-brown skin‚Äò,Taylor: What Did Jesus Look Like?

Merab Abramishvili (; 16 March 1957 ‚Äì 22 June 2006) was a Georgian painter whose works were influenced by medieval arts and European neo-expressionism. Abramishvili was born in Tbilisi, the capital of then-Soviet Georgia. He graduated from the Tbilisi State Academy of Arts in 1981. His future aesthetics were influenced by medieval Georgian frescoes and Orientalist miniatures which were introduced to him by his father, Guram Abramishvili, an expert in Georgian medieval art at the Art Museum of Georgia. Impressed by the medieval frescoes from the Ateni Sioni Church, the artist adopted the gesso technique to create the texture of a mural in his easel painting as well. Due to his unique visual language and aesthetics, Abramishvili emerged as one of the leading Georgian artists, who went beyond the established Soviet-era clich√©s. In the period of post-Soviet political instability, Abramishvili became preoccupied with mystical imagery. His works were displayed as part of solo and group exhibitions in both Georgia and abroad. His paintings are treasured by the Art Museum of Georgia and National Gallery of Art in Tbilisi as well as Museum Ludwig, Cologne, and private collections in Finland and the United States.

After a management crisis in 1983 at the 'Watersportvereniging Monnickendam', Bolweg among others like Henri van der Lubbe and Kees Kooij took the initiative for the 'Surf, Zeil en Watersportvereniging Uitdam'. The goal for this yacht club is to focus on new developments in the sport of sailing. At first this yacht club gave one of the first platforms in the Netherlands for International Windsurf competitions on open water. Burgee of the Surf, Zeil en Watersport Vereniging Uitdam Later, Bolweg was the leading race officer in the first Match race event during the 1989 SPA regatta at Medemblik as well as many other sailing events in the Netherlands. Also the new development to introduce a new event for the former Olympic classes drew Bolweg's interest. He was race officer during the 2008 edition of the Vintage Yachting Games and International judge during the 2012 edition in Bellano (ITA). Bolweg was also during many sailing events 'the voice' of the event.

His mother, herself an experienced regatta sailor in the 12 foot dinghy, taught him how to sail. Bolweg moved in his early childhood to Laren, where he received his education. His father, who was working in the grocery business, tried to interest Bolweg for a study and career in that line of business as well. Since Bolweg had the ambition to go to drama school this made him leave the elderly house and find his own way in life. For over twenty years, during the European winter season, Bolweg went for study and meditation to Buddhist monasteries in Thailand. On the age of 25 Bolweg developed a cancer in his left eye.

He was born at Buntingford, Hertfordshire and died in Manitoba, Canada. His twin brother, Charles Pigg, also played first-class cricket. Pigg was educated at Abington House School, Northampton, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, Pigg was a right-handed middle or lower order batsman and a right-arm round- arm fast bowler. He was successful as a batsman in his second game for the university side, scoring 34 not out and 32 against the MCC. This led to his selection for the 1877 University Match against Oxford University, though he was not successful. He played only one further match for Cambridge University in the 1878 season. Pigg graduated from Cambridge University in 1879 with a Bachelor of Arts degree; this was converted to a Master of Arts in 1885. He appeared in first-class cricket matches at the Hastings end-of-season cricket festival from 1886 to 1891, and these included several games in the North v South and Gentlemen v Players series, though he did not play in any of the \\"major\\" London-based fixtures. In 1886, he scored 59 and took four second innings wickets when a South team played the Australians. And in 1889 he took seven second innings wickets for 55 runs (and 11 for 112 in the match) as the Gentlemen beat the Players by one wicket.

Built in 1785 by one of Hiram's first settlers, it is now the oldest building in the town, and is a well-preserved example of late Georgian architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history John Watson, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War, arrived in the area that is now Hiram in 1778, and established a homestead on the east bank of the Saco River. His first house was washed away by spring flooding in 1785, after which he built the present house on higher ground above the river. The main block of the house Watson built is a large rectangular timber frame structure, with a large central chimney, hip roof, and a cut granite foundation. The combination of hip roof and central chimney is particularly rare for houses of this period in Maine. The main facade is five bays wide, with a central entrance that has early 19th-century Federal style features, with sidelight windows above recessed panels, and a broad louvered fan above. The main block was extended in the early 20th century with 1-1/2 story Colonial Revival wings on either side, each with four round-arch windows. The wing on the right joins the house to a 1-1/2 story shed and garage, which were probably originally detached from the house. The interior of the main block has retained much of its original material. A narrow and winding staircase leads up the second floor between the entrance vestibule and the chimney, and there are large rooms on either side. The kitchen, with a large open fireplace, is a long room that extends the width of the block behind the chimney. There are four bedrooms on the second floor.

Used by British European Airways (BEA) and other European airlines between 1953 and 1957 when it was replaced by the West London Air Terminal. Passengers checked-in and were issued with a boarding card and transported to either London or Northolt Airports using a fleet of coaches. right South Bank In 1952 British European Airways announced that it was to build a new London air station to replace the premises at Kensington. The three-acre site had been used for the 1951 Festival of Britain and was adjacent to London Waterloo station and connected by escalator to Waterloo tube station. The terminal building was created by modifying the festival's Station Gate building. The site was owned by the London County Council and the airline took a five-year lease on the site, it was expected that the conversion of the Station Gate building and the preparation of a coach park would cost ¬£90,000. Operation The terminal began operation on 19 May 1953 with the first coach leaving for Heathrow, it was officially opened two days later by Alan Lennox-Boyd the Minister of Civil Aviation. The terminal allowed passengers to check in for flights of not only British European Airways but other European airlines and was designed to cope with 2,000 passengers an hour. In the first year 900,000 passengers passed through the terminal. Helicopter service right Before the site was completed British European Airways had completed trial flights in 1952 using a Sikorsky S-51 and Bristol Sycamore helicopters to prove that it could be used for helicopter operations. Because of the restriction on single-engined helicopters and the need to fly along the River Thames to get to the site the service used the larger Westland Whirlwind which was equipped with floats. On 25 July 1955 the S-55s started a regular service from London Airport to the Waterloo, the last flight was 31 May 1956. Site closure The London County Council had plans to re-develop the south bank site and BEA notified the council that it would hand back the site in 1957 when a new West London Air Terminal was built to replace it. The new terminal was opened on 6 October 1957 and the Waterloo Air Terminal was closed.

Estimated to have been built around 1870, it is a rare surviving element of a 19th-century private camp in the state, when most surviving period camps were commercially run. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. As of recent the porch has caved in and the structural integrity is questioned. Description and history The Birch Island House is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a rubble foundation and a red standing seam metal roof. A two-story porch extends across the front, and the roof in the rear slopes down to the first floor, giving the building a saltbox profile. The porch is supported by square posts with a decoratively sawn balustrade. The house is five bays wide, with doorways in the center bay (the lower one providing the main entrance, the upper one access to the upper balcony) and windows in the flanking bays. Each floor has four rooms, with living, dining, and kitchen space on the first floor and bedrooms on the second and in the half-story above. Original pine board finish has been covered over by plasterboard in many of these rooms. The date of construction of the house is uncertain; mention of it does not appear in either local histories or in period works on Maine's sporting camps, and its remote location (access today is still not particularly easy) means it escaped wider notice. Tradition ascribes its construction date to 1870, although there is no documentary support for this. The island was documented to be home to the \\"Birch Island Sporting Camps\\", run by a private association, by the early decades of the 20th century, and this building appears to have functioned as a central lodge for the other facilities on the island. The camp was apparently abandoned around the 1950s, and was revived in the 1980s when it was acquired by R. David Murphy through the purchase of Birch Island Sporting Camps. R.D. Murphy, formed the Birch Island Sportsman Association, restored the sporting camps on the island and subdivided the island ownership. The Birch Island House ownership remains in trust with the Murphy family today.

A member of a family of musicians, he was the only one with several orchestral scores to his credit. Another notable work is an opera on an Irish theme, performed in Boulogne in 1878. Life George O'Kelly was born as George Alexandre Kelly in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Unusually, his first name was spelled in the English way (without an 's' at the end). His father was an Irish emigrant, the Dublin-born pianist Joseph Kelly (1804‚Äì1856); his brothers included the composer Joseph O'Kelly (1828‚Äì1885) and the music publisher Auguste O'Kelly (1829‚Äì1900). Around 1835, when he was still very young, the family moved to Paris where he grew up in the Faubourg Poissonni√®re area of the 9th arrondissement. Nothing is known of his musical education, but it can be presumed that he received early lessons from his father and later some more advanced training from others. His earliest public record is his membership in the 'Association des Artistes Musiciens', where he is listed in the annual membership lists for the years 1848‚Äì52. For the last three of these years he was listed as pianist employed at the Th√©√¢tre Historique (1850‚Äì1) and its successor, the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique (1852). Together with another brother, the business man Charles (Fr√©d√©ric) O'Kelly (1830‚Äì1897), he returned to Boulogne- sur-Mer in 1852 and established himself there as a piano teacher and composer/performer. An 1851 concert review mentioned his impending move to Boulogne: \\"O'Kelly est une jeune pianiste qui est venu se fixer ici, et qui est arriv√©e pr√©c√©d√© d'une reputation qui la soir√©e de lundi n'a fait que justifier\\".Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris, 3 May 1851, p. 142. Frequently, George was involved in the activities of the local Soci√©t√© Philharmonique.See https://dezede.org/dossiers/boulogne-sur-mer-1853-1870-societe-philharmonique/ resp. https://dezede.org/individus/okelly/. In 1853, he seems to have persuaded the local music shop of B. Filliette to publish his first two piano compositions. Other early scores were an Overture (1853) for orchestra, performed by Soci√©t√© Philharmonique in April 1853,L'Impartial, 7 April 1853. and the opera Une Nuit au bal, performed at the Th√©√¢tre Municipal in December 1853.L'Impartial, 29 December 1853. George married a widow with two sons in January 1856 and had two sons of his own, born in 1858 and 1860. For many years, the family lived in the historic walled town centre of Boulogne, in Rue du Puits d'Amour (1861‚Äìmid-1870s) and Rue de la Balance (until c.1881). In 1871, two works for piano and orchestra were performed in Boulogne, but his largest works were two scores, both performed in September 1878 on the occasion of the laying of the foundation stone to the new deep-sea harbour of Boulogne. One was the one-act comic opera Le Lutin de Galway and the other the cantata Le Port en eau profonde for baritone, chorus and orchestra. Although both works were well received by the press they were not taken up again in the following years. Seeking more artistic success may therefore have been one of the reasons why he moved back to Paris around 1881. Although he had a number of performances of small-scale compositions in Paris, and although his brother Auguste published many of his songs and piano works, establishing himself in the highly competitive environment of Paris proved difficult. He ran a small Acad√©mie Artistique in the Ternes area of the 17th arrondissement, and the dedications on his published works indicate that he had a number of wealthy pupils. Yet, step-by-step he moved out of the city, probably due to increasing rents. Having been widowed in 1884, he married again in the same year. His works of the 1890s were self-published, and in his last creative years (1903‚Äì9) his compositional activity focused on music for children that was published in magazines such as the Journal des demoiselles and for which he wrote both music and words. He spent his last years in the Paris suburb of Asni√®res-sur-Seine, where he died in 1914. Music As a composer, George O'Kelly always stood in the shadow of his brother Joseph, to the extent that some of his works were perceived as works by the latter. For instance, Le Lutin de Galway appears in some contemporary operatic catalogues as a work by Joseph O'Kelly. This work plays in 18th-century county Galway in Ireland, although the plot is not particularly Irish.See Klein (2014), p. 255‚Äì263; see Bibliography. Unfortunately, the music has not survived, so it is not possible to say whether there were any Irish influences in the score. George was the only member of the O'Kelly family in France, who wrote orchestral music, but this music, too, does not seem to have survived. His published music includes 26 works for piano (dating 1853 to 1909) and 24 songs (1874 to 1909). His early piano music is quite attractive, although it quite strictly follows established role models (sonata form). It is in a romantic language and includes polkas, mazurkas, waltzes and marches. His most ambitious piano work is the Marche fun√®bre (1876), an extended work written in memory of his father.Klein (2014), p. 270‚Äì273. He clearly developed stylistically: his Fol√¢tres gazelles op. 20 (published in 1904), for instance, sounds as if influenced by Scott Joplin. Although he performed with singers from the early 1850s, George O'Kelly's songs constitute a considerably later part of his worklist, the earliest pieces appearing in 1874. He took a while to develop, his best vocal music can be found in Le Camo√´ns mourant (1880) and his 1890s settings of poems by Alphonse de Lamartine and Fran√ßois Copp√©e. For Le Camo√´ns mourant, a work commemorating the anniversary of the Portuguese poet Luis de Cam√µes, he was awarded the Brazilian national order of merit, the Order of the Rose. His last songs are attractive little miniatures that appeared in children's journals, often to his own words.

It is situated in the Lochend / Restalrig area, next to Lochend Castle and near Meadowbank Stadium. The loch with its wide range of waterfowl is the main attraction, but there are also historical buildings, a children's play area, and sports areas. The park was awarded a Green Flag in 2012 in recognition of it being a quality greenspace. Within the park there is a 16th-century doocot which is Category B listed. History Modern flats overlooking Lochend Park The park was originally the grounds of Lochend Castle, part of the feudal lands of Robert Logan of Restalrig. The original castle was replaced by Lochend House in 1810 and only the servants quarters and kitchen chimney remain from the original house. The Doocot was built in the 16th century to supply pigeons to Lochend Castle. In 1564 it was used as a \\"plague kiln\\" to burn clothes and bedding of infected people during an outbreak of plague. In the 19th century it served as a boat house for the Royal Humane Society who were set up to save people from drowning. The boat was also used in winter to check if the ice on the loch was thick enough for games of curling. Lochend Loch served as Leith's main water supply from around 1650. Originally gravity-fed, there is an early 18th century pump station, which facilitated the process, between the doocot and the loch. Leith shared Edinburgh's water supply from the mid-18th century and the final water supplies from the loch were sealed off around 1920. Railway lines were built to west and south in the mid-19th century, isolating the park from the city. Although the railways were closed in the Beeching cuts of the 1950s it was only in the early 21st century that improved links were made on these sides, being required with the development of the new flats that now overlook the park. Wildlife There are a range of habitats to be found in the park. The loch is home to a wide variety of wildfowl, including swans, geese, coots, moorhens, mallards and herons. A viewing platform and planting beds, funded by the City of Edinburgh Council and WREN, were created around the pond in the spring of 2011. The viewing platform gives people greater access to see the wildlife and allows local schools the chance to take part in pond dipping activities. The new planting, including yellow flag iris and water mint, will enhance the biodiversity of the pond by providing more habitats and food for the local wildlife. Friends of Lochend Park The Friends of Lochend Park is a group of local volunteers who help to administer and improve the park resources. In 2014 they bought the old police telephone box at the north-east entrance to the park, to be refurbished as a store for visitor materials.

They are most frequently used for Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE), producing raster images via either a Liquid Toner or a Dry Toner model. Liquid Toner models use toner that is positively charged and thus becomes attracted to paper's negative charge. This occurs after the toner particles pass through a line of electrodes in the form of tiny wires, or nibs. The spacing of the wires controls the resolution of the plotter; for example, 100 or 400 wires to the inch. Dry Toner models use a process similar to xerography in photocopiers. Unlike a laser printer or photocopier, there is no transfer drum used in most electrostatic plotters; the imaging paper is directly exposed to the charging electrode array. Electrostatic plotters can print in black and white or in color. Some models handle paper sizes up to six feet wide. Newer versions are large-format laser printers and focus light onto a charged drum using lasers or LEDs. The image quality produced by some electrostatic plotters was lower than that of contemporary pen plotters, but the increased speed and economy made them useful. Unlike a pen plotter, the plot time of a rasterized electrostatic plotter was independent of the level of detail of the image.

Uggen (born 1964) is a Regents Professor and Distinguished McKnight Professor of sociology and law at the University of Minnesota, where he also holds the Martindale Chair in Sociology. Uggen is best known for his work on public criminology, desistance from crime and the life course, crime in the workplace, sexual harassment, and the effects of mass incarceration, including Felon disenfranchisement, re-entry, recidivism, and inequality. Background and early education Uggen attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison for undergraduate and graduate school, earning his PhD in 1995. Career Uggen began his studies at University of Minnesota in 1995, and was chair of the University of Minnesota Sociology Department from 2006 to 2012. Uggen gained recognition in the early 2000s for his research on work opportunities and recidivism. He went on to author a 2003 American Sociological Review article with sociologist Jeff Manza, \\"Democratic Contraction: Political Consequences of Felon Disenfranchisement in the United States,\\" which gained significant attention after finding that the 2000 United States presidential election could have gone to Al Gore if felons were not disenfranchised. Uggen and Manza went on to author \\"Locked Out: Felon Disenfranchisement and American Democracy.\\" They found that US ex-felons who voted in the 1996 US election were much less likely to have committed crimes in the four years following the election. Uggen's research on workplace authority and sexual harassment, incarceration and health, race in the United States criminal justice system, employer discrimination against felons, and other collateral consequences of criminal conviction have been influential both in and out of the sociology discipline. Uggen will assume the office of Vice President of the American Sociological Association in August 2017, and has received the 2016 SUNY Albany Hindelang Speaker Award for career contributions to criminology.

Jumonville was born in Paincourtville in Assumption Parish in South Louisiana, to Enoul Adolph and Lilly Lucena Brown Jumonville. A former dredging contractor, he acquired great wealth in his otherwise poor Pointe Coupee Parish when natural gas was discovered on five thousand acres of land which he had purchased in 1947 for as little as $4 per acre. The land lies on the Tuscaloosa Trend, which stretches across Louisiana north of New Orleans to the Texas state line. Jumonville called his land purchase \\"the best real estate deal since the Indians sold Manhattan Island for $24.\\" In 1982, a year before Jumonville's death, two gas wells were producing annual income in royalties of $10 million. Jumonville ostentatiously displayed his wealth through the purchase of his own jet airplane and three Rolls-Royce vehicles. He married his second wife, the former Barbara Nations (1939-2001), formerly Barbara Estes, the daughter of Claude Benjamin Nations and the former Laura Ellen Boone, in Rayville in 1967. She sported a 16-carat diamond ring, the setting of which once came off and rolled under a nightclub table in Las Vegas, Nevada. Jumonville was known for his theatrics on the Senate floor. Once in the early 1970s, he pulled off one of his boots and threw it at the clock in an effort to stop time and prolong debate on the topic at hand. His fellow lawmakers were then known to drink alcohol and become rowdy during the proceedings. Jumonville was succeeded in the state Senate by his son from his first marriage, J. E. Jumonville Jr., also a businessman and horse breeder from Pointe Coupee Parish. The Jumonville-Memorial Technical Institute in New Roads is named in Jumonville's honor.
