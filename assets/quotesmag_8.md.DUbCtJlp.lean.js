It tells the story of Temple Drake, a reckless woman in the American South who falls into the hands of a brutal gangster and rapist. It was adapted from the highly controversial 1931 novel Sanctuary by William Faulkner. Though some of the more salacious elements of the source novel were not included, the film was still considered so indecent that it helped give rise to the strict enforcement of the Hays Code. Long unseen except in bootleg 16mm prints, The Story of Temple Drake was restored by the Museum of Modern Art and re- premiered in 2011 at the TCM Classic Film Festival. The Criterion Collection released the film for the first time on DVD and Blu-ray in December 2019. Plot Temple Drake, the reckless daughter of a prominent judge in a small Mississippi town, refuses to marry her lawyer boyfriend, Stephen Benbow. This earns her a reputation in the town as a seductress. On the night of a town dance, Temple declines Stephen's proposal for a second time, and instead goes out with one of her suitors, Toddy Gowan. Toddy, who has been drinking, crashes their car near a dilapidated plantation home occupied by a speakeasy run by a man named Lee Goodwin. Trigger, a gangster and bootlegger at the speakeasy, forces Temple and Toddy into the house. Toddy, drunk and injured, attempts to fight Trigger, but Trigger knocks him unconscious. Temple tries to flee, but Trigger insists she spend the night. Lee's wife, Ruby, suggests that Temple sleep in the barn, and arranges for a young man named Tommy to stand watch. At dawn, Trigger shoots Tommy to death before raping Temple in the barn. Trigger proceeds to kidnap Temple, making her his gun moll, and brings her to a brothel in the city run by a woman named Reba. Meanwhile, Toddy awakens in a warehouse and skips town. Newspapers erroneously report that the missing Temple has traveled to Pennsylvania to visit family. At the speakeasy, Lee is arrested for Tommy's murder, and Stephen is appointed as his lawyer. Fearing for his life, Lee refuses to implicate Trigger in Tommy's murder. Ruby, however, directs Stephen to search for Trigger at Reba's home. Stephen tracks down Trigger to Reba's address, and finds Temple there, dressed in a negligee. Fearing that Trigger will kill Stephen, Temple falsely assures Stephen that she willingly went with him. Stephen believes her, and serves them summons for Tommy's murder trial. After Stephen leaves, Temple tries to escape, only to be attacked by Trigger. In the melee, Temple wrests his gun and shoots him to death. Temple returns to her hometown, and near the conclusion of the trial, she begs Stephen to dismiss her from testifying. He denies her wish, and forces her to take the stand in court, but, out of his love for her, he is unable to question her about Trigger. Despite his lack of questioning, Temple openly confesses everything that happened, including her witnessing Tommy's murder, her rape, and her murder of Trigger. At the end of her confession, she loses consciousness, and Stephen carries her out of the courtroom. Cast Production =Development= The film is based on the novel Sanctuary, by William Faulkner (pictured) In 1932, Paramount Pictures acquired the rights to the film's basis, the controversial novel Sanctuary (1931) by William Faulkner, for $6,000. Faulkner's novel dealt with a young Southern debutante held captive by a gang member and rapist. As the public felt the novel had a racy reputation, the film received a new title as the plot had been made more mild and to avoid associating it with the source work. Despite this, even before filming had begun, it was publicly condemned by U.S. women's leagues, an article in The New York Times, as well as the Roman Catholic Church. The credits only stated that Faulkner wrote the original novel. Robert Litell, who wrote a review of the film published in The New Republic on June 14, 1933, stated that the film producers also consulted Faulkner; statements about this are not present in the credits. Deviations from novel Several alterations were made to the screenplay that deviated from the source material: For example, in the novel, the judge is Temple's father; Phillips stated that \\"presumably\\" to make it more believable that he is \\"ineffectual\\" with her, he was changed into being her grandfather. For a short period before the film went into production, it was tentatively titled The Shame of Temple Drake. The relatively upbeat ending of the film is in marked contrast to the ending of Faulkner's novel Sanctuary, in which Temple perjures herself in court, resulting in the lynching of an innocent man. E. Pauline Degenfelder of Worcester Public Schools wrote that the characterization of Temple differs from that of the novel version, and that the film gives her a \\"dual nature\\" of a dark nature and a light nature. Gene D. Phillips of Loyola University of Chicago wrote that she is \\"better\\" morally than the novel character. According to Pre-Code scholar Thomas Doherty, the film implies that the deeds done to Temple are in recompense for her immorality in falling into a relationship with the gangster instead of fleeing him. =Casting= Miriam Hopkins was cast as the titular Temple Drake George Raft was initially cast as the male lead of Trigger, but dropped out of the production, which resulted in his being temporarily suspended by Paramount. Raft felt taking the role would be \\"screen suicide\\" as the character had no redeemable qualities, and also demanded a salary of $2 million. He was ultimately replaced by Jack La Rue, then a bit player for Paramount who had garnered some notice for his performance in a Broadway production of Diamond Lil opposite Mae West. According to Filmink the fact the film ultimately \\"did little for La Rue’s career... served to give Raft a false idea of the quality of his instincts when it came to script selection. \\" Miriam Hopkins, who was cast in the titular role of Temple Drake, was a newcomer at the time of filming, and had only begun establishing herself in two Ernst Lubitsch films: The Smiling Lieutenant (1931) and Trouble in Paradise (1932). Hopkins' mother was reportedly upset that her daughter was portraying a rape victim. Hopkins herself would continually cite the role as one of her personal favorites due to its emotional complexity: \\"That Temple Drake, now, there was a thing. Just give me a nice un-standardized wretch like Temple three times a year! Give me the complex ladies, and I'll interpret the daylights out of them.\\" =Filming= Principal photography of The Story of Temple Drake began in mid- February 1933 on the Paramount Studio lot in Los Angeles, California. According to biographer Allan Ellenberger, the mood on the set was \\"gloomy\\" due to the dark subject matter, and the cast members frequently played pranks on one another to lighten the mood. Jean Negulesco, a sketch artist and technical advisor at Paramount, helped design and orchestrate the film's rape sequence. Though the film only suggests the rape, as the scene concludes with Trigger approaching Temple, followed by her scream, Hopkins recalled that Negulesco had extensively \\"planned how it could be done... If you can call a rape artistically done, it was.\\" Release =Censorship= Will H. Hays, who was in charge of the Motion Picture Production Code, had objected to any film adaptation of Sanctuary, and, after the film was made, forbade any reference to it in advertising materials. However, Joseph I. Breen, who was in charge of public relations for the Hays Office, stated the finished film was so tame in comparison to Faulkner's novel that patrons who had read it and watched the film would \\"charge us with fraud.\\" In March 1933, the Hays Office recommended several cuts be made before the film was released, with the central rape scene being of utmost concern. In the original cut (and in Faulkner's novel), Temple's rape occurs in a corn crib, and she is at one point penetrated with a corn cob during the assault. In the initial cut of the film, the rape took place in a corn crib, and featured shots in which a corncob is picked up by Trigger and examined after the rape. These shots were allegedly only supposed to be included in rushes and not in the final cut, but were considered obscene enough that the Hays Office ordered Paramount to reshoot the rape sequence in a barn, and mandated that no footage of a corncob could be shown. The scenes at Reba's home were also \\"portrayed too graphically,\\" according to the Hays Office, and they ordered Paramount to excise footage and dialogue that indicated that the home was a brothel. It was now portrayed, despite nude statuary, as a boarding house. Some lines were cut, while Ruby's use of the word \\"chippie\\" (a slang term for a woman of low morals) was occluded by a clap of thunder. Because the film was considered so scandalous, it has been credited with spurring the strict enforcement of the Hays Code. =Box office= The Story of Temple Drake premiered theatrically in the United States on May 12, 1933. According to film historian Lou Sabini, it was one of the highest-earning films of the year. =Critical response= Several protests and critical articles in newspapers appeared after the production company had purchased the rights before the release of the film. Phillips wrote that some critics, while acknowledging the murder of Trigger would be justifiable, believed that it was wrong for the film to justify it. A review published in The Washington Times lambasted the film, describing it as \\"trash,\\" while the New York American deemed it \\"shoddy, obnoxiously disagreeable... trashy, sex-plugged piece.\\" Edwin Schallert of the Los Angeles Times was similarly unimpressed, describing the film as \\"deliberately sordid, unsympathetic, and nearly offensive,\\" as well as \\"crudely realistic.\\" Some critics were more favorable in their responses, such as Martin Dickson of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, who deemed the film a \\"compelling, if not always pleasant, photodrama,\\" adding that Hopkins brings \\"a vital and credible characterization to the part.\\" The Atlanta Constitution also praised Hopkins' performance as \\"outstanding,\\" and also praised La Rue as \\"excellent.\\" Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times heralded the cast as \\"well chosen,\\" also adding that \\"Miss Hopkins delivers a capital portrayal.\\" =Home media= The Story of Temple Drake largely remained unavailable to the public after its initial theatrical release, never even receiving television airings in the United States. The Museum of Modern Art restored the film in 2011 and subsequently screened it to the public. The Criterion Collection announced they will be releasing the film on Blu-ray and DVD for the first time on December 3, 2019. Legacy Faulkner stated that initially he wished to end the plot at the end of Sanctuary but he decided that, in Degenfelder's words, \\"Temple's reinterpretation would be dramatic and worthwhile.\\" Degenfelder believes that he may have gotten inspiration for the sequel, Requiem for a Nun, from The Story of Temple Drake due to common elements between the two.

The region's intractable political problems, and the cost of maintaining Cuban troop support and equipping the MPLA-PT, weakened the Soviet commitment to the building of a Marxist-Leninist state in Angola. Angolan leaders, in turn, complained about Soviet neglect—low levels of assistance, poor-quality personnel and matériel, and inadequate responses to complaints. Angola shared the cost of the Cuban military presence and sought to reduce these expenses, in part because many Angolan citizens felt the immediate drain on economic resources and rising tensions in areas occupied by Cuban troops. Moreover, dos Santos complained that the Soviet Union dealt with Angola opportunistically—purchasing Angolan coffee at low prices and re-exporting it at a substantial profit, overfishing in Angolan waters, and driving up local food prices.http://countrystudies.us/angola/111.htm Country Studies Economic Relations Compared to the Soviet era, trade between Russia and Angola is now quite minimal.

The station's studio is located at the 7th Floor, Queensway Commercial Tower, 118 Amorsolo St., Legaspi Village, Makati City, while its transmitter is located at Gen. Alvarez Street, Barangay San Rafael III, Noveleta, Cavite. It operates Mondays to Fridays from 4:30 AM to 12:00 MN, Saturdays from 5:00 AM to 12:00 MN after the playback of the Saturday Weekly Family Appointment with El Shaddai, and Sundays from 5:00 AM to 11:30 PM. It also broadcasts 24 hours on special occasions especially during overnight celebrations in Christmas, New Year, Easter and Anniversary of El Shaddai. History DZSA was born in the late 1960s. Ernie Baron was part of the anchors of the fledgling station, before he returned to ABS-CBN in 1986. The station then aired an OPM format dubbed as Himpilang Sariling Atin DZSA 1230. It was then broadcasting on 1230 kHz until 1978, when it transferred to the present frequency of 1314 kHz, adopting the 9 kHz spacing for AM Broadcasting. In 1981, at the height of his real estate business expansion around what is now Ninoy Aquino International Airport, Velarde bought DZSA from the original owners of the Delta Broadcasting System, for P2 million, because he needed the parcel of land on which it stood. Besides, the owners would not sell the land unless the radio station was included in the deal. Later, the radio station alone would cost him millions more to sustain its operations. Upon acquisition, he started operating the station following his recovery from a heart ailment to propagate the healing message from the Word of God.\\"Pacman deep into Bible study.\\" Filipino Reporter 23 Mar. 2012: 21.

Merrie Melodies cartoon, directed by Chuck Jones and written by Tedd Pierce. The short was released on January 14, 1956. It features the voice talents of Mel Blanc, providing the voice of Bugs Bunny, as well as the uncredited performance of Arthur Q. Bryan (Elmer Fudd). Plot At the beginning, the narrator explains how clothes strongly affect people's behavior. For an example, a typical businessman's suit is replaced with a pirate outfit, causing him to act like one (\\"Batten down the keelhaul! Kill the women and children first! Blood!! Gore!! Spit 'em on the tatters!\\"). The narrator then adds how sometimes one piece of clothing, like a hat, can change somebody's behavior. Elmer Fudd is next seen in \\"boring regular old fashioned everyday clothes,\\" and have his bowler hat replaced with a hunter's cap, which makes him act like a hunter (\\"Bang! Bang! Bang! Come out of your holes, you cowardwy wabbits...and I'll bwow you to smitherweenies!!\\"). The scene then focuses on him chasing Bugs, wanting to see the color of Bugs' \\"spurting blood.\\" To allow the audience to explore this phenomenon some more, a truck for the \\"Acme Theatrical Hat Co.\\", going uphill, allows its loose doors to fly open, which in turn, allows all the hats inside to fly out all over the valley. An army helmet lands on Bugs' head, bearing Technical Sergeant stripes. Bugs suddenly adopts the authoritative behavior of such, proceeds to berate Elmer for hunting rabbits instead of the enemy, and orders Elmer to \\"forward march\\" off the river bank, where many of the hats are. Upon emerging from the river, Elmer comes up wearing the hat, glasses and corncob pipe of General Douglas MacArthur, paraphrasing his famous line by saying, \\"I have wetuwned!\\" When Elmer starts menacingly approaching him, Bugs quickly digs a hole into the ground and loses his sergeant helmet, which now straddles the rabbit hole. Elmer slips under water for a second, coming up wearing his hunter's hat again. Bugs emerges from burrowing under a game warden hat. Elmer shoots at the sergeant helmet, thinking Bugs is wearing it. Bugs, now a game warden, chastizes Elmer for shooting sergeants out of season.Notice that, when Elmer starts to explain (\\"Well, you see, sir, I...\\"), he enunciates the R in \\"sir\\". Arthur Q. Bryan's proper pronunciation of r and w was an unusual and recurring phenomenon in this film. A gust of wind blows both hats away. A pilgrim hat lands on Elmer, who explains: \\"I was just shooting turkeys for the first Thanksgiving dinner.\\"Elmer enunciates the r in \\"first\\" and \\"turkey\\" properly. Meantime, an Indian headdress lands on Bugs, who adopts a stereotyped Indian war whoop, takes the gun away from Elmer, and a short-lived chase ensues. During this, the hats fall off; Elmer, returning to his original form, snatches his gun back from Bugs, and gives chase; the chase continues to a busy highway. Bugs scampers across, with Elmer stuck on other side. Suddenly, a little old lady's bonnet lands on Elmer, making him act like one. Meantime, a Boy Scout hat lands on Bugs. Bugs announces his duties as a Boy Scout and helps Elmer cross the street. A passing car spins them both around, the hats fly off, and the chase resumes. Elmer blasts away at a crevice where Bugs is hiding. When Bugs comes behind Elmer from the other side of the rock, the rabbit is wearing a \\"gangster\\" fedora in the vein of Edward G. Robinson, and starts to threaten Elmer. Right then a cop's hat lands on Elmer, who then starts to collar Bugs; the \\"gangster\\" slips him $10,000 as a bribe. Elmer initially refuses the bribe, but before he can hand it back, Bugs' hat is replaced by a British judge's wig. In response to Elmer's \\"bribe\\", Bugs sentences Elmer to \\"only\\" 45 years and hard labor, out of consideration to his family. Shortly after Bugs walks away, lamenting how he cannot abide a dishonest police officer, Elmer calls out: \\"Oh, Judge, wiww you mawwy me?\\" Elmer is now wearing a bridal veil. A top hat falls on Bugs, and he accepts the proposal. As with Rabbit of Seville, the \\"Wedding March\\" by Mendelssohn plays in the underscore, as Bugs is carrying Elmer toward a cottage. Bugs says to the audience: \\"Ya know, I think it always helps a picture to have a romantic ending.\\" Iris out.  Voice Characterizations  * Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny (voice) * Arthur Q.

It features the opening title song, \\"Where My Heart Will Take Me\\", as sung by Russell Watson, alongside instrumental compositions by Dennis McCarthy. Background McCarthy first became involved in composing music for Star Trek with the first episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, \\"Encounter At Farpoint\\". He went on to work on several more Star Trek series, along with the film Star Trek Generations. He won an Emmy Award for his composition of the theme tune for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. He recorded the score for the pilot episode, \\"Broken Bow\\", with an orchestra on September 10 and 11, 2001. Despite an offer to postpone the recording on the second day because of the September 11 attacks, they decided to continue recording the music. McCarthy described this as \\"the hardest recording session of my entire career\\". It was rumoured that Jerry Goldsmith would compose the theme tune for Enterprise, having previously created the themes for both The Next Generation and Star Trek: Voyager. This was later denied on his official website, and series executive producer Rick Berman explained that they would be seeking to use \\"a little bit more contemporary kind of music\\". Release The album was released in the United States on May 14, 2002 on the Decca Records label. The release was an Enhanced CD featuring the music video of \\"Where My Heart Will Take Me\\". It included two versions of the title song of Enterprise, entitled \\"Where My Heart Will Take Me\\", which had been previously called \\"Faith of the Heart\\". The song was written by Diane Warren and sung by Russell Watson. A version of the song that had been re-recorded for Watson's album Encore appeared alongside the version that accompanied the opening credits of the television series. The remaining tracks on the album were instrumental music composed by McCarthy for the pilot episode of Enterprise, \\"Broken Bow\\". Reception In his review for Allmusic, Neil Shurley said that \\"Where My Heart Will Take Me\\" sounded better on the album than it did on the television show, but didn't tie in with McCarthy's work, whose work he described as an \\"orchestral tapestry\\". Overall he said that \\"There's nothing spectacular here, but Enterprise does make a representative and worthy addition to the Star Trek musical canon\\".

Dragon Half has a colorful cast with several of the characters named after famous RPG game mascots.Mita Ryusuke English page 2 March 2008 However, only the main cast are shown in the anime adaption.  Characters  From left to right: Pia, Lufa, Mappy, and Mink (the main character) ; : :Daughter of Ruth, a dragonslayer, and Mana, a dragon, and the star of Dragon Half. She is like your typical teenager except for the fact that she is half-dragon. She has dragon-red hair and eyes as well as horns and a tail, can fly with dragon-wings that appear when needed, can breathe fire, and is overall very strong and resistant to most forms of damage, including poisons. She also seems to be jinxed, bringing all sorts of misfortunes to herself and anyone around her and also inadvertently making herself a lot of enemies. In the manga, her main enemies are King Siva, Princess Vena, and Azatodeth. Mink is also infatuated with Dick Saucer, the handsome dragonslayer and popstar. However, because of her half-human/half- dragon heritage, she is actively seeking out the legendary , which would make her fully human. :As a part-dragon, she undergoes ecdysis, in which she sheds her skin and becomes more powerful. Her power continuously grows each day after her first ecdysis. She also experiences wild mood and personality swings around the time her ecdysis is supposed to occur. While the first ecdysis just made her stronger with minimal physical alterations (six horns instead of two), the second ecdysis would supposedly turn her irrevocably into a giant disfigured monster of terrifying strength. :According to a prophecy, one who shed their skin twice would gain power surpassing that of the demon gods (including Azatodeth) but would turn into a large black monster with ten legs and four eyes. This is prevented by an arm bracelet gotten from Mink's great- grandfather. The bracelet monitors and suppresses Mink's power. When it's turned off, the counter on the bracelet rises, showing Mink's rise in strength. If the counter ever reaches 999, the second ecdysis would occur. However, when the Demon Lord was released from the Gourd of Saints by one of his minions soon after he was sealed, he overpowered everyone until Mink turned off her bracelet, allowing the counter to reach 999. The foretold ten- armed, four-eyed monster did indeed appear, but it was in the form of a mark on Mink's backside. With her new power, she easily killed Azatodeth with the holy sword her mother made to combat the Demon Lord. :Notably, in order to eat during the quest, anything that is slain by her or the group, except Damaramu, is cooked and eaten shortly after the battle ends. :At the end of the manga she and Dick have a daughter named together. ; : :Mink's best friend. Being a physically weak elf, she relies on using (equally weak) magic. Her magical ineptitude also extends to the use of the Lightning Staff; she usually hits everything but the target. :Lufa has an extremely sadistic personality and is quite amoral and untactful, often making fun of the misfortune of others and receiving pleasure from causing it (in the OAV these traits are non-existent). Lufa has also a high sex drive, making advances onto nearly every visually attractive person she comes across, including Mink and other females. She becomes a human at the end of the manga, having been turned into a toad by Azatodeth and then drinking the \\"People Potion\\". :The original romaji of her name was \\"Rufa\\" but this was not revealed until much later in the manga, so the spelling \\"Lufa\\" was used. In the manga, she has a father named Link. She never mentions her mother, although later on, Link is seen with a female elf who is either Lufa's mother or a girlfriend. ; : :A human girl (who can be mistaken for a dwarf due to her short and stocky body) who is friends with Mink and Lufa, as well as a small fairy-mouse named Mappy. She constantly wears body armor, even forgetting to take it off before swimming, due to her overly-protective parents. ; : :Pia's pet . Mappy acts as Pia's bodyguard whilst traveling, able to transform to the size of a grizzly bear at will. This tends to deter Lufa from whacking Pia when she gets on her nerves, as Mappy often whacks Lufa straight back. He also reflects his mistress' moods; in the anime episode two he becomes dreamy-eyed just like the girls when Dick Saucer happens to come upon them, while as a mouse he shouldn't have any interest in him. :In the anime Mappy is present from the beginning, whereas the manga has him enter at the end of Volume 1. The name \\"Mappy\\" is a reference to the video game of the same name. ; : :Dick Saucer is a famous adventurer, having replaced Ruth as King Siva's official dragonslayer, as well as a pop idol. He is the epitome of a pretty-boy, walking around singing his own theme song, and is admired by many girls, especially Mink, Lufa, and Princess Vena. However, because King Siva tricked Saucer into thinking that Mink is a red dragon in disguise, he tries to kill her, much to Mink's disconcertion. :In the manga, the reason he slays dragons is because his parents were killed by a dragon fifteen years ago. Also he was born into royalty with his parents being the Sea King and Mermaid Queen. In the end, he learns the truth about his parents' murder and is about to marry Mink when Lufa interrupts with news about a new Demon Lord. But either way, this reveals that he now has a love interest in Mink. :At the end of the manga he and Mink have a daughter named Pink together. ; : :The slime-half daughter of King Siva (human) and Venus (a transformed slime), her mother's true nature was exposed when Vena was born a slime herself, the shock causing her father losing the last hair on his head and her mother to die of heartbreak. It was only by constantly studying black magic since birth that she was able to finally able to achieve a human form, but this form can be undone if she gets hurt sufficiently. :Her non-human heritage is, however, one of the biggest advantages over Mink that she has in battle due to being a slime despite her magically-effected human appearance, having a slime's oozing-gelatinous nature beneath and therefore no \\"vital organs\\" to suffer mortal damage from conventionally lethal physical attack (she was not harmed by Mink accidentally stabbing her through her torso) while being very proficient in magic at the same time. :Vena is Mink's rival for the affections of Dick Saucer. She will stop at nothing to achieve her goals, and goes out her way to make Mink's life miserable. She is also very defensive about her father, who has spoiled her rotten (most likely because her human form resembles her late mother's). :In the manga, Vena has studied magic since early childhood and can summon creatures. She plays an important role, but after an incident involving Mink and her father occurring midway through the manga, her role slowly fades away to nothingness. She has violet hair and eyes (as well as a violet slime-body) with a tiara in the OVA but in the manga, her hair and eyes (and slime-body) are pink (just like her mother) and the tiara doesn't come until chapter 37. :At the end of the manga she gives up on Dick and becomes Migu's girlfriend. ; : :The ultimate dumb muscle. He constantly brags about his (next to non- existent) greatness as a fighter, talking of himself in the third person, usually as \\"The Mighty Damaramu\\". On the DVD commentary for the anime, voice actor Brett Weaver states that the reason Damaramu talks in the third person is \\"not out of ego, it's just that he has to say it over and over so that he doesn't forget his own name\\". He is sent by King Siva to hunt Mink, but due to his considerable lack of intelligence — and Mink's jinx — it is a doomed prospect. :The first time he battled Mink, he ended up with his own laser sword running through his skull. However, during the Brutal Killer Martial Arts Tournament, it was revealed that Damaramu had in fact survived, mostly because of what he refers to as his \\"compact brain\\". Because his brain is much smaller than normal, his brain was only slightly scratched by the sword. Also, with a little help from Blacksmith Tony, he was resurrected as a cyborg. But before he and Mink went to battle, he stupidly wasted energy showing off his new abilities and was knocked by Mink into the lava pit below the fighting floor. In the ending credits, we see his next form as a head with little arms and legs. This is shown a lot more in the manga, as he starts to get dumber and works with Dug-Finn. ; : :Also simply known as \\"The King\\". His daughter, Princess Vena once described him as \\"balder than a baboon's ass with a face like a squashed frog\\". He is probably the least intelligent character of them all, save for Damaramu, and would go out of his way to please his spoiled daughter. He also has a desire to kill Ruth for betraying his duty as the kingdom's dragonslayer, and then to take Mana for himself. His favorite method of punishing insubordinates is a stone block alternately called \\"Super Crushing Press\\" or \\"The King's Anger\\". ; : :A priest-like figure, and probably the royal magician, Rosario is King Siva's right-hand man in dealing with Mink. Fortunately for her, he tends to use outdated or even downright silly methods, which (partly due to Mink's jinx) occasionally backfire, such as an attempt to feed Mink a laxative which is consumed by Dick Saucer instead. He fancies himself to be a great and powerful magician, but has absolutely no powers and often resorts to using cheesy special effects (such as the hot water and dry ice fog bit) to impress others. ; : :Damaramu's wyvern/dinosaur/bird-type thing which acts as Damaramu's mount, as it is large enough to carry him. It participates in Damaramu's first battle with Mink and company but is eaten after Damaramu's defeat. It's later resurrected as a cyborg like him. ; : :Mink's human father. He was once King Siva's dragonslayer known as , his nickname coming from his moving at speed in his bright-red armor, which allowed him to look like red lightning when fighting. Originally, King Siva had sent Ruth to slay the imperial red dragon (Mana) who had invaded the land but, instead, he fell in love with her at first sight and married her, running away with her to live in obscurity. :Ruth retired from the dragonslaying business, the couple living in a quiet valley where they raised their daughter, Mink. However, the human-dragon couple have long-since devolved into constant domestic strife as the unemployed adventurer has exposed himself to have also been a skirt-chasing layabout; Lufa misremembers his fame as . He disapproves of Mink's crush on Dick Saucer, mostly because of his ego as a fabled swordsman. :Although he is excessively perverted and lazy, he will jump in to save his wife and daughter if they are in immediate danger. His special attack (the \\"Ruth Crush\\") carves the letter \\"R\\" into his opponents. Although retired, he is still a great swordsman, once defeating a large group of monsters attacking Mana and Mink in the woods. When asked about it, he denies having done anything, to which Mana says that he is a good liar. He also still lives up to his nickname, being able to move faster than even Saucer when attacking a monster that had taken Mana hostage. ; : :Mink's mother. As an , Mana has the ability to change into human form (in the manga, she turns back into a dragon when she is angry). As a result, she can change her form into a beautiful blonde woman; the only evidence that she is a dragon are her small fin-like projections behind her ears. She also puts Ruth in his place whenever he freaks out or acts like a pervert. :Mana created the holy sword \\"Azatodeth-Buster\\" to combat the Demon Lord. It has the ability to make anyone thinking evil/perverted thoughts feel sick just by being in its presence. ; : :A slime who had fallen in love with King Shiva, ironically because he was (according to their daughter) \\"balder than a baboon's ass with a face like a squashed frog\\". In order to win his affection, she swallowed the legendary \\"People Potion\\" to change herself into a beautiful human female. Naturally, the King fell in love with Venus and the two married. She gave birth to his daughter, Vena, but died of a broken heart that she was born a slime (an incident which happened before the beginning of the story in the manga and the anime series). ; : :Master demon and the youngest of three sons of Azatodeth the Warlock (his elder brothers are Migu and Ruth). In the manga, his father is the series' main villain. Very skilled in magic, but is still a kid at heart and easily distracted by candy offerings. He's often bullied by Migu, who takes out his frustration and anger on him. ; :The main antagonist who is a gigantic three-eyed monster that orders his troops of monsters and kills people. He lives on a bizarre island known as the \\"Demon King's island\\". 2,000 years ago, he destroyed various cities. Mink's maternal great- grandfather Joseph and his minions tried to stop him but the minions got beaten up. Luckily, Joseph had \\"The Gourd of the Saints\\" - an item which took 200 years for him to make and could capture Azatodeth in there. The bad news was he had forgotten to wear his false teeth so he could not recite the spell properly. As a result, Joseph was nearly killed and the Gourd got broken, but the pieces had magic power left and they lived as three artifacts needed to reconstruct it. :He tries sacrificing his own sons to kill Mink by trapping them all in a room and filling it with lava. Fortunately, they are saved by Rogue, who had anticipated this event and set up a trap door in the floor beforehand in preparation for it. In the end, Azatodeth is killed by the holy sword wielded by Mink, after she had undergone her second ecdysis. :Although Azatodeth plays an important role in the manga, he does not in the anime, only mentioned and in a background. ;Blacksmith Tony :You never see this character, but he is important to the story. He is ingenious for making mecha-suits and creatures. He made many of Damaramu's prosthetic bodies. ;Gai :An stripy- headed warrior who participates in the Brutal Killer Martial arts tournament. = Manga-only characters = ; :Lufa's father. An elf wizard, but probably just as bad at magic as his daughter. He and Zelda along with Pia's parents are named after the famous Nintendo characters created by Shigeru Miyamoto which Ryūsuke Mita looks up to. ; :Lufa's mother. An elf who does not use magic like her husband or daughter. She completely dotes upon her husband, a fact that Rouce can't understand at all. ; :Pia's father (who can be mistaken for a Dwarf due to his short and stocky body) who faints when he hears bad news or jokes. In later volumes, he seems to faint all the time. ; :Pia's mother. She has a tendency to faint as well. Ruth once openly wondered, in front of his wife, why she married the \\"chubby dwarf\\" and thought it was because Mario was secretly rich. ; :The middle son of Azetodeth. Migu has a teddybear called \\"Kuma-san\\" and he wears teddybear underwear. He also has a variety of odd spells and a magic robot that his father gave him when he was a child. Later, in chapter 39, he is summoned by Princess Vena while he is putting his teddybear to bed and dressed in only his underwear; Vena takes a picture of this scene and blackmails him into serving her or she will reveal the photo to the whole world. Outraged, Migu destroys the photo in chapter 42 but it is revealed that Vena made many copies of it. :Appearing midway throughout the series, Migu dislikes Mink and Mink dislikes him back. Fortunately, they forgive each other towards the end of the season. :At the end of the manga he becomes Princess Vena's boyfriend. ; :Dug Finn and Migu's sensitive elder brother. Ruth claims he hates seeing people suffer and later is seen as someone who hates violence. Although he says this, he seems happy to fight Mink and often takes Migu into a special room for \\"chastisement\\". He has two pets known as \\"The God of Fire\\" and \\"The God of Thunder\\". He also has a talent for making robots, but one of them, a giant cleaner robot, went amok and destroyed one third of his castle. He is shown making three robots later; \\"Navel 08\\", \\"Dark Cherry\\", and \\"Apple\\". In the end, he joins forces with Mink against Azatodeth when the latter betrays him and his brothers. ;Navel 08 :A Gynoid whose attacks don't resemble their names at all; for example, her \\"Missile Punch\\" causes her head to fly off. She was created by Ruth and looks up to him. Her name refers to Cara cara navel oranges because she appears with orange hair on the back cover of Volume 6. Her body is stolen by Damaramu during the battle on Azatodeth's island. ;Dark Cherry :Another Gynoid with long, dark hair and a sweet personality, hence her name. Like the other robots created by Ruth, she is fairly useless. ;Apple :A small robot whose body is modeled after an army tank especially one from World War II. She bears an uncanny resemblance to My from the Moomin series which is popular in Japan. She can come up with perfect strategies for defeating opponents. Although her strategies have a 99.8% of success, she has no ability to carry them out, seemingly unable to even tell others what her plan is. She is broken when Migu accidentally punches her out of frustration for her uselessness. ;Meatball creatures :Meatballs with smiley faces and noodles as arms. A large group of them meet Mana and Mink in the woods one day and politely ask them for a bite of their hearts. When they are refused, they all attack the two of them. All of them are defeated by Ruth and his special attack, which carved the letter \\"R\\" into them. ; :An old man with a star on his forehead. He is the leader of Pido and the one that encourages Mink to slay down Azatodeth because three years ago he ruined Pido, taking away all the wealth for himself. Shortly after that, Pido became a market selling Manjū. ;Granny Ladora :A fortune- teller that was the lover of Starman when she was fifteen years old. She tells the group about where the three artifacts are. ;Suzuki :Azatodeth's beautiful private receptionist. She appears only once in the manga. She fights Mink because she was promised a special bonus and a three-week paid-leave vacation if she defeated her. ; :Dick Saucer's cousin. He was named after Sonic the Hedgehog. Like his namesake, he can run very fast. A running gag is that Sonic is girl-crazy and will take pictures of Dick Saucer in order to get dates. Twice, he disguises as him with a wig. ; :A mermaid, Sonic's mother and the aunt of Dick Saucer. Anna is extremely attractive. ;Rosa and Lydia :Two very beautiful mermaid sisters who protect their beach from intruders. Their beach leads to the Sea Kingdom. Named after the female characters Rosa and Rydia from Final Fantasy IV. ;Petit Cathy (Kathleen) :Big, horned, ugly female demon that has recently been hired by Azatodeth. She goes into multiple fits of rage when someone calls her actual name \\"Kathleen\\" or forget to call her \\"Petit\\". ;Paul :Long ago, he was a brave young warrior. Now he is an old man who likes to brag and tell exaggerated stories. He is initially seen serving Petit Cathy. After meeting Mink, Lufa, Pia, and Mappy, he regains his fighting spirit and protects a group of people from being taken hostage by Cathy. ;Vulconte :A Golden eagle unable to fly. He is one of Azatodeth's minions, but Vulconte is really weak and afraid of heights. Vulconte claims to have beaten Migu three times in a row, but only in a kids game. ;Azadeth :A triclops initially mistaken for Azatodeth and believed to be his son during the 28th Malice championship - until Dug Finn cuts him in two. ; :Mink's maternal grandfather, who is for a long time believed to have been the red dragon that killed Dick Saucer's parents, but very late in the manga it turns out he did not. In actuality, he was captured and cloned by Azatodeth years ago to create a rift between Neptune's and Kaiser's dragons. The clone was imprinted with the Demon Lord's personality and was the true murderer of Dick Saucer's parents. The clone is eventually killed by Ruth and Saucer. ;The God of Fire :A 12-feet tall Leopard-spotted creature with shark fins for ears. It can gout black clouds of smoke from its nostrils. ;The God of Thunder :A creature that looks like the God of Fire, only a foot shorter. ;The Temple Girl Twins (a.k.a. the Temple Women) :Twin sisters who wear turbans and take care of King Siva's castle. They also serve as Princess Vena's servants. ;Gaya :A red dragon that appears later in the manga. He met Mana many years ago and he wanted to marry her, but she married Ruth months later. When Gaya meets Mink and she tells him Mana is her mother, he gets so outraged for the fact Mana married a male human he attacks her several times until Saucer kills him with his signature attack, the \\"Saucer Special\\", while mistaking him for Mink. :Later on, he is resurrected by a vampire. However, Mink destroys him completely. ;Laura :After Gaya is killed, Pia finds Saucer's pendant on the ground. Mink disguises herself as a human called Laura before attending a special party for Saucer, then she returns the pendant to him. Vena discovers her tail coming out of Laura's dress and Mink is exposed. Vena freezes all the guests before a statue is thrown by Mink. Laura is never seen again except in flashbacks. ; :A green-haired mermaid in love with an orange-haired man called Adol. When they are introduced, Siren is kidnapped by a red octopus called \\"Tako\\" until it is apparently cooked by Mink and Siren is rescued. ; :Siren's crush. When Siren is kidnapped, he gets worrisome and cowardly until he gets Siren back. Adol is named for the main protagonist of Ys. ;Broud :A medium- sized talking plant that looks like a cross between a rose and a Cooktown orchid with eyes and vines who eventually gets squashed by Vena by accident. Later, he comes to back to life as a gigantic 6-feet tall flower calling himself \\"Great Broud\\". He has the ability to squash ladybugs with one of his vines. ;Dancing King Heartenberg :A king that lives in a castle in the sky and prefers to be called \\"Honey\\". Honey had a nasty argument with his wife, Sarah, after she served his least favorite food, a carrot, fifteen years earlier. The argument became a war which lasted 100 days; Sarah fled to the castle's underground chamber to end the fight. Honey was upset and decided to overcome his hate of carrots (which he accomplished in three years). As for Sarah, she was kidnapped by a knight calling himself the \\"Armored Lord\\". When Mink hears about this, she rescues Sarah from the Armored Lord, only to find out the Armored lord is really a mass of armor controlled by a midget and Sarah is the armored lord's wife despite being married to Honey which she still loves. When Sarah returned from the underground chamber, he accepts her and the daughter she had with the Armored Lord. The three of them are last seen dancing happily together as a family. ;Sarah :Honey's wife. She likes carrots. She was hypnotized by the Armored Lord and had a daughter with him. Her daughter has a horn on her head and is small enough to stand on the palm of Honey's hand. ; :A young king whose problem is that his land is covered with zombies. In his castle, there is a special sword that can get rid of the zombies and Deirdré Dead Lai, a vampire woman that has been responsible for the cause of the zombies (although Simon calls her \\"High Emperor Dead Lie\\" and believes she is male until later on). When he finally discovers Deirdré Dead Lai is female, he falls in love and asks her to marry him. Deirdré Dead Lai agrees and brings her four handmaidens along so they can live in the castle. :Simon has a tendency to shower gold coins around. ;Ralph :Simon sel Monte's younger brother. He is often crowned prince, but he refuses to inherit the throne. Ralph and Simon are named after two members of the Belmont family from the Castlevania game series. ; :An female Vampire. She was Azatodeth's lover until he dumped her. Now she lives all by herself with her four handmaidens who represent the four Classical elements. Dead Lai is a major villain for a couple of volumes and only found out to be female near the end of her story arc. ; :One of Deirdré Dead Lai's four handmaiden-generals. She is 26 years old. Associated with Earth. She was the first of the Generals to meet Mink and cared a lot about her looks. When Mink was fighting her and ripped her clothes, she felt Mink was trying to say how much better her body was. ; :Another one of Deirdré Dead Lai's handmaiden-generals. Associated with Fire. Has a pet lizard which turns into a giant monster when it sees anything sexy or perverted. ; :A fat, overweight brunette with braids and is one of Deirdré Dead Lai's handmaiden-generals. Associated with Air. Bufu has no expression change on her face and only talks with her name. Jasmine however can understand her and know what expression she is \\"meant\\" to be showing. Despite having a large protective layer of fat, she is knocked out in one hit by Mink. Bufu is in fact shown in the anime version. When talking about the Brutal Killer Martial Arts Tournament, a number of people and monsters are shown. To the right of the screen is Bufu. This is also seen in the Ending Credits. ; :An adorable airhead with cat ears and a pink heart on her forehead. She is one of Deirdré Dead Lai's handmaiden-generals. Associated with Water. She has unlimited tears, being able to cry enough to submerge a whole city. In the battle against Mink, she was fairly useless as her tears simply flowed back into Dead Lai's cavern. Though she acts all nice and sweet, this masks a somewhat nasty side. One example of this is the start of Chapter 34 where she is lying in an overly \\"cute\\"-style bed with her little bird tweeting to wake her up. She comments on this and then tells the bird (while still looking and acting cute) \\"Shut your rotting hole or else I'll gouge your eyes out!\\".

It provides an aerial link from the Oriental Village at Teluk Burau to the peak of Gunung Machinchang, which is also the location of the Langkawi Sky Bridge. The total length is , with a journey time from the base to the top of around 15 minutes. It was officially opened in 2003. Langkawi Cable Car is located just north of Telaga Harbour, Pantai Kok, with the entrance within 'Oriental Village' at the foot hill of the Mat Chincang mountain range. It is located to the north-west of the Langkawi International Airport, on the west coast of the main island of Langkawi. It is approximate 30 minutes drive from Kuah town and 15 minutes drive from Langkawi International Airport. Construction and design Langkawi Cable Car The Langkawi cable car project was first mooted in 1999 by the then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad when he flew over Gunung Machinchang in a helicopter during his visit to Langkawi. The project was a joint venture by Doppelmayr of Austria and a local company. After a survey of the mountain conducted in May 2000, the construction of Langkawi Cable Car began in April 2001. The gondola cable car system was selected as it permitted a long span of over 900 metres. There are three stations for the cable car; the Top Station is located at the peak of Gunung Machinchang which is the second highest peak of Langkawi. In the middle is an \\"angle station\\" where the gondolas make a 45-degree turn to reach the Top Station. As there is no road to the top due to the steepness of Gunung Machinchang, all the structural components needed to be lifted to top with helicopters in combination with an auxiliary working cable and then assembled on site. The gradient or the slope between the Base Station and the Middle Station is said to be the one of the steepest in the world at 42° It has the longest free span for a mono-cable car at . When there are strong winds, the cable car operation would be put on hold. There are 35 normal gondolas, each of these can carry six persons with total weight up to 480 kg, with a total maximum capacity of 700 to 800 passengers per hour. There are also 4 bottom glass gondolas which sit 6 passengers and 2 VIP gondolas each with 3 leather seats. The gondolas travel at a distance of some 70 meters above the canopy of forest of the Machinchang Range. The Langkawi cable car was completed in August 2002 at a cost of RM 46 million. The soft launch for the cable car was held for six days in October 2002 which was well-received, it then opened to the general public on 1 November 2002. It was officially opened in 2003. Stations View of the Base Station located at the Oriental Village from a gondola. =Base Station= The Base Station is located at the Oriental Village, a theme shopping centre housing 30 individually designed buildings showcasing Malaysian and Oriental architecture. From this base, visitors can take the ride to the Machincang range via the Langkawi Cable Car on gondolas. The SkyDome, a 360-degree panorama screen dome theatre located at the Base Station, offers visitors free viewing while they are waiting for their ride on the Cable Car. The gondolas arrive at the station around every 30 seconds. The cable car may be closed 2 days a month in predetermined maintenance schedule, and in bad weather condition. =Middle Station= View of the Middle Station from the Top Station An intermediate Cable Car station on the eastern ridges provides access to the eastern cliffs with its 3 vertical chimneys and the 360-degree views. The gondolas make a 45-degree turn at this \\"angle station\\" to reach the top. The journey from the Base Station to Middle Station covers 1,700 meters in length. The Middle Station is at an elevation of 650m above sea level, visitors can alight at the station and walk up to the viewing platform, or continue to travel on the gondolas for another 450 meters up to the Top Station. =Top Station= There are two circular viewing platforms at the top of Gunung Machinchang, which are both a short walk up the stairs from the top station and offer 360° views. The top station is located 708m above sea-level is about 5 °C cooler than the lowlands. Features Approaching the peak where the Middle Station is located The ride afford a view of the surrounding forest, the Telaga Tujuh (Seven Wells) waterfall, as well as the sea. From the top station there is an inclinator called SkyGlide and a mountain route that allow access to the Langkawi Sky Bridge. There are two viewing platforms at the top of Machincang mountain, and other amenities. There is a 2.5 km walking trail, the SkyTrail, through the forest from the top station that goes down to the middle station, and then the Seven Wells (Telaga Tujuh) waterfall, although walking unguided through the trail is not advisable as the trail is not well-maintained and there is a risk of getting lost.

Completed in 1947, the trail originally stretched from Diamond Hill to the Blue Hills Reservation in Randolph, Massachusetts, but encroaching development had truncated the route by the 1970s. Plans to rebuild that lost connection were put forward in 2003 as part of Massachusetts' Commonwealth Connections statewide greenway initiative. The Appalachian Mountain Club and the Friends of the Warner Trail maintain the Warner Trail. The trail passes through Cumberland, Rhode Island and the Massachusetts towns of Canton, Sharon, Foxboro, Wrentham, and Plainville. There are no overnight facilities on the Warner Trail. The Warner Trail connects to the Bay Circuit Trail.http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dcr/stewardship/greenway/pdfs/boston.pdf Route features White rectangles and metal disks mark the trail.

Route description Route 184 begins as a freeway from northbound exit 86 of I-95 just north of the city of Groton. It crosses over Route 12 later at an interchange and soon becomes a surface street after another quarter of a mile. The road continues east northeast towards the village of Center Groton, where it meets Route 117. It continues another via Burnetts Corner to the head of the Mystic River in the village of Old Mystic near the Stonington town line. Route 184 travels four miles (6 km) through the northern part of Stonington before entering the town of North Stonington. It has a junction with Route 2 at a rotary south of North Stonington center. Beyond Route 2, the surroundings become rural as Route 184 heads towards the Rhode Island state line. Route 184 ends just short of the state line at Route 216 near exit 93 of I-95. The roadway continues past Route 216 to the state line as State Road 626, which originally connected with Rhode Island Route 3 prior to the construction of I-95 in the area. Route 184 is also known as Gold Star Highway, New London Turnpike, and Providence-New London Turnpike along its lengths in Groton, Stonington, and North Stonington respectively. History In 1818, a turnpike was chartered to provide an improved road from the Thames River ferry (between New London and Groton, Connecticut) to the Hopkinton and Richmond Turnpike in Rhode Island, known as the Groton and Stonington Turnpike. The toll road ran more or less along the modern alignment of Route 184. The establishment of this road completed a continuous turnpike route from Providence, Rhode Island to New London. The turnpike corporation was dissolved in 1853, one year after opening continuous rail service from New York City to Boston via Providence.Frederic James Wood (1919), The Turnpikes of New England and Evolution of the Same through England, Virginia, and Maryland, Marshall Jones Company. Pages 315-317. The route from the borough of Groton to the town center of North Stonington was designated as State Highway 331 in 1922. Highway 331 used modern Route 184 to the junction with Route 201, then Route 201 until the intersection with Route 2. In 1932, Route 84 was established from part of old Highway 331 along the current routes of Route 184 to Old Mystic, then modern Route 234 to US 1 in Pawcatuck. In 1935, Route 84 was relocated to the current route along the old Groton and Stoninton Turnpike alignment to the Rhode Island state line. In 1958, Route 84 was renumbered to Route 95 to serve as a temporary link for motorists following I-95, which had not yet been completed in Southeastern Connecticut. In December 1964, Route 95 was renumbered as I-95 opened in the Groton area. The eastern terminus was also truncated from the state line to its current location.

He spoke seven languages and boasted of having experienced more adventure in a single year than most men had witnessed in a lifetime. He is known among sportsmen, claiming to have successfully hunted more than 300 jaguars — or \\"onças\\", as the big cats are colloquially known in parts of Latin America—in the Mato Grosso jungles of Brazil. Siemel's accomplishments in pursuing the large and often dangerous jaguar (the biggest cat in the western hemisphere and third largest in the world) are all the more impressive because on many of his hunts he was allegedly armed only with a spear.  Biography  Born in Riga, Latvia, Siemel moved to the United States in 1907 at the age of 17. Staying in the states for only two years, he subsequently headed for Argentina where he was employed in a Buenos Aires printing shop. In 1914 Siemel traveled to the jungles of Brazil where he worked as a gunsmith and mechanic in the diamond mining camps of the Mato Grosso. There he met a native who taught him to become a \\"Tigrero;\\" that is, a hunter who kills jaguars armed only with a spear. In the article \\"Interviewing the Tiger-Man\\", Siemel states: \\"… I learned the art from a poor native who had nothing but a home- made spear where I had my high-powered rifle. But I do think I was a good pupil and will admit that it calls for experience and judgment.\\"1 In the July 1937 issue of Ye Slyvan Archer, he wrote that: \\"It is only logical and natural that I should (prefer the bow to the rifle). The spear is a primitive weapon, so is the bow. While I would not want to say that hunting big cats with a rifle can not be plenty dangerous and exciting under all circumstances, particularly so in our Matto Grosso jungles, where vision is extremely limited, it seems to me that the bow complements the spear. If I now had any use for a shield besides, I should feel perfectly equipped.\\"2 With his skill as a hunter Siemel worked on ranches of the Pantanal hunting jaguars, or \\"onças,\\" hired by landowners to protect their livestock. In 1925, he killed his first jaguar using a zagya, a seven-foot spear, making him the first white man to accomplish such a feat. This did not long go unnoticed by the \\"civilized world.\\" By 1931 a monograph, Green Hell, by Julian Duguid, appeared. The book recounts a 1929 trip across the Pantanal where the author and two fellow adventurers employ Siemel as their guide. Here Siemel is first given the moniker \\"Tiger Man,\\" which went on to become the title of Duguid's 1932 biography of the hunter. Encouraged by Duguid, Siemel began to lecture at explorer clubs throughout the world. In 1937, while lecturing in Philadelphia, Siemel met Edith Bray, a young photographer, who later joined him in the Pantanal. Three years later, at the age of 47, he married Edith, and the two remained in the Pantanal and began raising a family. During this time, Siemel became an actor, appearing in the 1937 fifteen-episode Frank Buck serial Jungle Menace as Tiger Van Dorn. The serial was compiled into a feature film in 1946 and released under the title Jungle Terror. Sasha, Edith and their children, Sondra, Dora, and Sasha Jr. (Sashino), moved to southeastern Pennsylvania after purchasing a farm in 1947. Bom Retiro, as they named the farm, became Siemel's permanent residence for the rest of his life. Here the Siemels' second son, Carlie, was born in 1955, completing the family. Siemel led a quiet life, lecturing and continuing to lead expeditions to South America. He now spoke six languages: Latvian (learned in the streets in Riga), Russian (in the schools he attended as a youngster in Latvia), German (at home, his mother was German), English (in the USA), Spanish (in Argentina), and Portuguese (in Brazil). As an author, Siemel had been writing articles for various outdoor magazines, including National Geographic. In 1949, Sasha and Edith co-wrote the book Jungle Wife, an account of family life in the jungle. He penned his autobiography,Tigrero, in 1953. It was to be made into a movie by director Samuel Fuller. Instead, Tigrero is the subject of a 1994 documentary by Mika Kaurismäki. Tigrero: A Film That Was Never Made featured Fuller and Jim Jarmusch visiting the proposed Amazon locations of the film. In 1954, Siemel's book Jungle Fury was published. (Jungle Fury is the same book as Tigrero but retitled for the UK.) Siemel was interviewed by journalist Charles Collingwood for the Adventure series produced by the American Museum of Natural History and broadcast on the CBS television network in 1953. The family returned to Brazil briefly in 1959, when Sashino was thirteen years old. His adventure is told in the 1965 book Sashino. In 1963, The Sasha Siemel Museum and Store opened in Perkiomenville, Pennsylvania, in a century-old former story mill located on the Perkiomen Creek. The museum housed Siemel's collection of hunting trophies, works of art, curios, minerals, shells, coins, weapons, Indian utensils and many other items. \\"Among the most interesting of the displays are Sasha Siemel's mementos of his many years of daring adventures and explorations as the only white man to hunt jaguars armed with a hand-made spear. Here are the trophies of many exciting hunts and the equipment used in hunting and capturing jaguars.\\"3 Museum admission was 75 cents for adults and 25 cents for children. The museum closed in 1969 after Siemel's last trip to the Pantanal, in which he guided a group of geologists. Sasha Siemel died in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, in 1970 at the age of 80.

Wang was born in Haimen county, Jiangsu province, China, the son of a prosperous peasant farmer, and studied radio communications in Shanghai before entering the military academy in Chongqing (Chungking), (then the temporary capital of China) in 1939. Promoted lieutenant in 1941, he served in the intelligence section of the general headquarters. Following the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific, he was sent to Australia as a captain with the Chinese military mission.Biographical information from Australian Dictionary of Biography online In Melbourne in 1942 he met Mabel Chen, an Australian-born Chinese, who chose the English name David for him. In 1947 they were married in Singapore, where he opened a business importing woollen goods from Australia. These connections to Australia enabled him to gain a seven-year Australian business residence permit in 1948, despite the then-official White Australia Policy, which prevented Asian immigration.Building a New Community: Immigration and the Victorian Economy, Andrew Markus The permit was issued by the Immigration Minister Arthur Calwell, who became a close friend of the Wang family, despite his lifelong support for White Australia.Chinese family dream \\"It is not widely known that he [Calwell] was a long-time friend of the Wang family, supporting Wang’s application for a business permit to enter Australia in 1948 and nominating him to become a JP in 1964.\\" He opened his furniture business in Little Bourke Street in 1950. The business grew rapidly and by the 1960s Wang was a leading businessman and a leader of the Chinese community.

In 1969 he was elected to the Melbourne City Council, becoming the first Chinese-Australian to win a seat in local government.

Route description Route 185 begins as Hartford Road at an intersection with US 202 and Route 10 in the Weatogue section of Simsbury. The road heads east across the Farmington River and turns southeast, passing by Talcott Mountain State Park then heading into the town of Bloomfield, where it becomes Simsbury Road. In Bloomfield, it passes the western end of Route 178 and continues generally southeast across the southwestern part of town into West Hartford. At the Bloomfield-West Hartford line, the road becomes four lanes wide as it intersects with Route 218. The road runs for another in West Hartford as it continues southeast to end at an intersection with Route 189 near the University of Hartford. History In the 1920s, the Weatogue-Hartford route was a primary state highway known as Highway 115. It ran along modern Route 185 to Route 218 then used modern Route 218 to connect to modern US 44. Route 185 was established in 1932, running north-south from US 44 in West Hartford to the current western terminus. In 1935, Route 218 was established and took over the portion of modern Route 185 (former SR 920) east of modern Route 218. In 1963, the ends of Routes 185 and 218 were swapped resulting in the present configuration: the section south of the 185/218 junction was transferred to Route 218, and the section east of the junction was transferred to Route 185.Connecticut Routes, Route 185 Junction list References External links 185 Transportation in Hartford County, Connecticut ","title":"Connecticut Route 185"},{"id":"16048530","text":"The Uptown Theater is a historic theater located in Kansas City, Missouri. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as the Uptown Building and Theatre. History The original design for the Uptown was carried out by Kansas City architect Robert Gornall. Construction first began on the portion of the Uptown that would house offices and shops along Broadway. This office and retail portion of the Uptown was completed in November 1926. Gornall's plans also called for a theater to extend along the rear portion of the building, with a tower at the north end to serve as an entrance and foyer. As the office and retail portion of the Uptown was nearing completion, the footing was also poured for the theater portion of the Uptown; however work was halted until the Universal Film Company acquired the unfinished building in 1927. Austrian-born designer John Eberson was hired to complete the construction of the Uptown and oversee the decoration of the interior. Kansas City-based Fleming-Gilchrist Construction Company served as the general contractor for both phases of the Uptown construction. Eberson completed the design of the Uptown in Italian Renaissance style as an atmospheric theatre. It was the only one of its kind in Kansas City as well as the State of Missouri. The inside of the theater replicated an outdoor Mediterranean courtyard, complete with a nighttime sky ceiling with twinkling stars, clouds, and mechanical flying birds. The Uptown opened on January 6, 1928 to a film showing of \\"The Irresistible Lover\\". The Uptown was the first theater in Kansas City outside of downtown to show first-run films. In the summer of 1939, the Uptown copyrighted a Fragratone system, which funneled fragrances into the auditorium via the ventilation ducts at appropriate moments during films. The Uptown hosted movies as well as live vaudeville and stage productions through the 1970s. By the late 1970s, the theater began to function primarily as a concert venue, and it remained that way until it closed its doors in 1989 as a result of the owner failing to pay back taxes. During its later years, the interior had fallen into disrepair, and all of the original details were whitewashed.http://www.pitch.com/kansascity/larry-sells- uptown-theater-broadway-corridor-valentine-neighborhood/Content?oid=4025299 Redevelopment The theater's marquee from the final performance of The Get Up Kids. Following the closure of the Uptown Theater in 1989, the property was transferred to the Land Trust of Jackson County. The Land Trust was a governmental corporation established by state law to sell properties to satisfy unpaid taxes. At that time, Larry Sells was president of the Land Trust, and he spent a few years trying unsuccessfully to sell the vacant theater to developers. In 1994, Larry Sells resigned from the Land Trust and purchased the Uptown on his own with plans to restore the theater as well as the entire commercial corridor of Broadway between 38th Street and Armour Boulevard. Sells set up a corporation under the name UGA, LLC to complete the purchase for $7,500. Following the acquisition of the Uptown, a $15 million renovation of the theater was completed. The original splendor was restored in the details and colors of Eberson's original design. In addition, of new lobby, bar, office and banquet space was added. Because of the redevelopment, the Uptown remains one of the few remaining atmospheric theatres still in operation. Permanent seating remains in the balcony and rear half of the main floor. The front half of the floor nearest to the stage is now open for table arrangements and general admission standing for concerts. On July 2, 2005, native Kansas City band the Get Up Kids played their \\"farewell\\" show at The Uptown. The band re-united three years later.

ΔΗΜΟΣ ΚΕΡΚΥΡΑΙΩΝ Τελευταία ενημέρωση: 20 September 2005History of City Councils from the Municipality of Corfu website via the Internet ArchiveCorfu city hall website through Internet Archive Quote: The Capodistrias Museum – Center of Capodistrian Studies, was founded in 1981. It is a donation by Maria Desylla-Kapodistria, Mayor of Corfu during the period 1956–1959. The House and the estate are situated in Koukouritsa, near the village of Evropouli and were parts of the family property of the first Governor of Greece. The items that are exhibited in the Museum are personal belongings of Ioannis Capodistrias, as well as furniture and other objects from that period. donated the residence to the three primary cultural societies of Corfu specifically for that purpose. The museum also functions as a centre for Kapodistrian and Corfiote studies.Eleni Bistika Kathimerini 30 December 2007 ...στις τρεις ονομαστές πολιτιστικές εταιρείες της Κερκύρας, με την προϋπόθεση να λειτουργήσει ως Μουσείο Καποδίστρια και, μελλοντικά, και ως Κέντρο Κερκυραϊκών Μελετών. Translation: bequeathed it to the three famous cultural societies of Corfu under the condition it would function as a museum and in the future as Centre for Corfiote studies History Maria Desylla-Kapodistria, grand niece of Ioannis Kapodistrias, donor of the museum, past mayor of Corfu and first female mayor of Greece. The museum was the summer home of Ioannis Kapodistrias, first governor of Greece. In 1979 Maria Kapodistria bequeathed the estate under contract No. 4541/3.11.1979 to the Reading Society of Corfu, the Philharmonic Society of Corfu and the Society of Corfiote Studies. According to its charter, the museum is to house, curate and exhibit the personal effects and portraits of Ioannis Kapodistrias as well as the period furniture belonging to the family. Following the death of the donor the three societies created a foundation under the name \\"Kapodistrias Museum-Centre of Kapodistrian Studies\\". The Kapodistrias residence is located in the southwest corner of an area near the village of Evropouli nine kilometres from Corfu city. The area is called Koukouritsa meaning a geological rise or hill in the local dialect and denoting the top of the hill. The hill and the surrounding area belonged to the Kapodistrias family for centuries. In the middle of the 18th century a small summer cottage was built to serve as a summer retreat for the Kapodistrias family. In 1797 after the end of the Venetian occupation, Ioannis Kapodistrias' father, Antonios Maria Kapodistrias, representing the more conservative side of Corfu aristocracy quickly came to a dispute with the French occupiers and had to escape to the summer cottage at Koukouritsa. The family resided there until the early 19th century. Young Ioannis Kapodistrias followed his family to the retreat and stayed there for approximately three years. The three Corfu societies accepted the estate along with the exhibits but Maria Kapodistria did not provide an ongoing financial endowment. The Greek state and even the municipality of Corfu largely ignored the project. Nevertheless the three societies founded the Museum as a civil liability company. The three societies, however, did not have the finances to continue the day-to-day operations of the museum and soon they were forced to close it for an extended period of time.Political speech of George Papandreou in Corfu 7 October 2005 via the Internet Archive Ομιλία Γιώργου Α. Παπανδρέου σε ανοιχτή πολιτική εκδήλωση στην Κέρκυρα 7 October 2005 Quote: Να αξιοποιήσουμε τον πολιτισμό μας, να ανοίξει επιτέλους και το Μουσείο Καποδίστρια. Δεν μπορεί ο Υπουργός Πολιτισμού να βρει 40.000 ευρώ για να λειτουργήσει το Μουσείο Καποδίστρια που είναι ένα σημαντικό μνημείο για τη χώρα μας. Translation: We must take advantage of our civilisation, let the Kapodistrias museum be open at last. The Minister of Culture cannot find 40,000 euro for the operation of the museum which is an important monument for our country. The subject of the museum's closing and the indifferent reaction of the Greek government was actually raised by opposition leader George Papandreou in 2005 who characterised the museum as an important monument for Greece. The three societies applied to the Greek Ministry of Culture, other state organisations as well as to various municipal governments in Corfu, but were ignored. However Christos Fokas, a local businessman and industrialist but residing in Switzerland, owner of the Corfu Palace Hotel, informed the three societies that he was ready to cover the museum's operating expenses donating the sum of 20,000 euro per year. The donation enabled the Museum to open once again to the public and it operates on a daily basis from 10:30 a.m. to 2 pm. It is closed on Mondays.

His elder brother, father, and grandfather were all consuls.  Career  Atilius was consul for the first time in 257 BC, with the patrician Gnaeus Cornelius Blasio, and prosecuted the First Punic War against the Carthaginians. He defeated the Carthaginian fleet off the Liparaean islands, though not without considerable loss. He then obtained possession of the islands of Lipara and Melite, which he laid waste with fire and sword. On his return to Rome, he received the honour of a naval triumph.Polybius i.25; Zonar. viii.12; Orosius iv.8; Fasti Capitol. Atilius was consul a second time in 250, with his patrician colleague being Lucius Manlius Vulso. In this year, the Romans gained a brilliant victory at Panormus, under the proconsul Lucius Caecilius Metellus. Thinking that the time had now come to bring the war to a conclusion, they sent both consuls to Sicily with an army of four legions and two hundred ships. Regulus and his colleague undertook the siege of Lilybaeum, the most important Carthaginian possession in Sicily; but they were foiled in their attempts to carry the place by storm and, after losing a great number of men, were obliged to turn the siege into a blockade.Polybius i.39, 41—48; Zonar. viii.15; Orosius iv.10; Diod. Fragm. xxiv. According to William Smith, this Atilius is the first Atilius who bears the surname Serranus, which afterwards became the name of a distinct family in the gens. Caius Atilius Serranus, who was a praetor in 218 BC and a failed candidate for the consulship in 216, was his son and the ancestor of all subsequent praetors and consuls from this family. One of his descendants, Sextus Atilius Serranus, became a consul in 136 BC with Lucius Furius Philus (wrongly called Publius by Smith).

Mense was born in Rheine. He studied with Peter Janssen at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf from 1906 to 1908, and then with Lovis Corinth at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin in 1909. In 1913, he co-organized (with August Macke) the first exhibition of the Rhenish Expressionists in Bonn. In 1914, he spent some time at the artists' colony at Ascona, where he met Georg Schrimpf and Heinrich Maria Davringhausen. From 1921 to 1925, Mense lived in Munich, where he became associated with the New Objectivity style, in particular being heavily influenced by Schrimpf, as well as by the Italian Valori Plastici group, with whom he exhibited in Florence in 1922. In 1925, he was appointed professor at the Kunstakademie Breslau. Alexander Kanoldt, also associated with New Objectivity, was appointed professor at the same time, and the two attempted to establish a center of New Objectivity there, but came into conflict with the mainly avant garde circle centered on Oskar Moll. Mense remained a professor at Breslau until 1932; soon thereafter, his works were branded degenerate art by the Nazis, and 34 works were seized and destroyed. He lived from 1945 in Bad Honnef, and died in 1965 in Königswinter. He was awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz in 1961.

Anabare Bay is on the east side. Buada Lagoon is the darker region in the south west.Republic of Nauru. 1999. Climate Change Response Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change URL Accessed 2006-05-03 Nauru is positioned in the Nauru Basin of the Pacific Ocean, on a part of the Pacific Plate that formed at a mid oceanic ridge at 132 Ma. From mid Eocene (35 Ma) to Oligocene times a submarine volcano built up over a hotspot, and formed a seamount composed of basalt. The seamount rises over 4300 m above the ocean floor. This hotspot developed simultaneously with a major Pacific Plate reorganisation. The volcano was eroded to sealevel and a coral atoll grew on top to a thickness of about 500 m. Coral near the surface has been dated from 5 to 0.3 Ma. The original limestone has been dolomitised by magnesium from sea water. The coral was raised above sea level about 30 m, and is now a dolomite limestone outcrop which was eroded in classic karst style into pinnacles up to 20 m high. To at least a depth of 55 m below sea level, the limestone has been dissolved forming cavities, sinkholes and caves. The island was a seabird rookery and depressions on the surface of the island were filled by a phosphate rich guano layer up to several metres thick. Anibare Bay was formed by the underwater collapse of the east side of the volcano. The collapse formed an amphitheatre shape with the arc shaped block rotating outwards at its base from about 900 to 1100 m below sea level. Below 1100 m the slip bulges out down to 2000 m deep. In Ijuw District to the north of the bay there are lineaments trending inland to the north west. Buada Lagoon was formed by solution of the limestone when the sea level was lower, followed by collapse. Nauru is moving at 104 mm per year to the north west along with the underlying Pacific Plate. Streams and rivers don't exist in Nauru. Water is gathered from roof catchment systems. Water is brought to Nauru as ballast on ships returning for loads of phosphate. Fresh water can be found in Buada Lagoon, and also in some brackish ponds at the escarpment base in Ijuw and Anabar in the northeast. There is an underground lake called Moqua Well in Moqua Caves in the southeast of the island.

He began his junior career in 1999 at the age of 16 with the Brandon Wheat Kings in the Western Hockey League WHL. After two years he moved to the Vancouver Giants, where he was the point of best defenders. The 2003-04 season spent Ardelan at the Prince Albert Raiders, where he could show his offensive potential and also the second best scorer of the team was. Although Ardelan over five years in the WHL was one of the best defensive players, he was taken into account by any team of the National Hockey League Entry Draft. The Canadians, however, received after his junior years in 2004 an invitation to training camp of the San Jose Sharks, could there not prevail. Ardelan first professional team was finally the South Carolina Stingrays of the ECHL, where he was a rookie point right away the best defender in the league and also his first game in the American Hockey League played at the Portland Pirates partners.

Antoniazzi was born in Cremona, the sixth child and pupil of Gaetano, and was the ablest and most consistent violin maker of his family. Unfortunately he lived somewhat in the shadow of Leandro Bisiach and he did not sign many of the instruments from his best period. His instruments can be divided into three periods: from his apprenticeship and early development until about 1887–8, during which he made instruments similar to those of his father; his best period, which lasted until about 1904, during which he developed his own style and worked primarily for Leandro Bisiach; and the period from about 1904 when he worked for the firm Monzino and Sons, during which he made beautiful instruments although working with less care, especially with regard to the varnish. Today these are his best-known instruments. He had many students and followers. He died in Milan. Riccardo used a great variety of models, and his varnish was yellow- orange or at times dark red. He is known to have used four different labels, and he also used a brand during his time with Monzino, with his initials A.R. inside a double circle surmounted by a cross. This brand is often attributed to Romeo, but it seems that he never used it.

The game is essentially a home version of Konami's arcade game Run and Gun, which featured similar graphics and gameplay but no NBA license. Konami followed up Give 'N Go with Run and Gun 2 and the NBA In The Zone series. Gameplay NBA Give 'N Go screenshot - the Denver Nuggets play the San Antonio Spurs Similar to Run and Gun, the in-game camera is at one end of the basketball court. Gameplay is fast-paced, much like NBA Jam and Konami's own Run and Gun. Elements lifted from arcade basketball games included limited fouls (that automatically lead to free throw shots), faster than real time clock, and basketballs rarely travel out of bounds. Free throw shots are simply a manner of trying to get two dots in the center as possible. The shot always goes in as long as both dots are blue; otherwise the shot always misses. Gaming options include exhibition, regular season, playoffs, and arcade mode. Certain slam dunks and three-point field goal shots are replayed periodically. A play- by-play announcer comments on the in-game action. In addition to an arcade- style game, players can also customize in-game rules, or play a full-fledged simulation of professional basketball. Players who wish to play in the playoff mode can choose either to re-enact the 1995 NBA Playoffs, have their playoff tree randomized by the computer or customize their own NBA playoff experience. Regular season games can also be customized while games in the \\"arcade mode\\" use the 1995 NBA Playoffs. Players can be substituted before a game but not during it. All NBA players are evaluated on a scale of zero to three stars; with three stars being the highest rating. Shaquille O'Neal & Charles Barkley are missing from the game's rosters. Michael Jordan had retired from professional basketball at the time, so he also does not appear in this game. Differences between versions The game was released in Japan as . Localization and translation from Japanese to English were performed by veteran translator of Japanese television programs Jeremy Blaustein, while working in Tokyo as one of the staff members responsible for this game.

The application was introduced as open-source by Autodesk in November 2005, and the code was contributed to the Open Source Geospatial Foundation in March 2006 under the GNU LGPL. MapGuide features an interactive viewer that includes support for feature selection, property inspection, map tips, and operations such as buffer, select within, and measure. MapGuide includes an XML database for storing and managing content, and supports most common geospatial file formats, databases, and standards. The MapGuide platform can be deployed on Linux or Microsoft Windows, supports Apache and IIS web servers, and offers extensive PHP, .NET, Java, and JavaScript APIs for application development. History MapGuide was first introduced as Argus MapGuide in 1995 by Argus Technologies in Calgary, Alberta. In the fall of 1996, Autodesk acquired Argus Technologies and within a few months the first release under the Autodesk brand was introduced, Autodesk MapGuide 2.0. The software progressed through a number of releases leading up to the current Autodesk MapGuide 6.5. To this day MapGuide 6.5 and previous releases are known for ease of deployment, rapid application development, data connectivity, scalability, and overall performance. Despite its success, the MapGuide 6.5 architecture has some inherent limitations. To this day most MapGuide applications rely upon a client Plug-in, ActiveX Control, or Java applet with much of the application logic written in JavaScript using the APIs offered by the client-side plug-in. All spatial analysis is performed client- side on rendered graphics rather than on the underlying spatial data. And finally the server platform is very Windows-centric. In spring 2004 a team of developers at Autodesk began work on what is now MapGuide Open Source.

In urban areas, where 76% of Pernambuco's 8.4 million inhabitants live, access to house connections for water supply is 91% and access to sewerage is 49%. Concerning service quality, rationing is a constant reality in about 85% of the municipalities, including the Recife Metropolitan Region. This is primarily to a lack of water resources, particularly during the dry season, and frequent drought conditions. The State Secretariat of Water Resources (SRH) is in charge of both water resources management and water supply and sanitation policies. The State Water Company (COMPESA) is responsible for water and sanitation service provision in most of the state. COMPESA provides urban water supply and sewerage in 170 and 20 municipalities respectively, out of 189 in the State. The remaining municipalities are served by municipal public providers. COMPESA operates under concession contracts with municipalities and is regulated and supervised by the state-level multi-sector regulatory agency ARPE.

Antoniazzi was born in Cremona, where he learned his craft in the Ceruti workshop before establishing himself in Milan in 1870 and bringing with him the Cremonese tradition of his teachers Enrico and Giovanni Battista Ceruti. He died in Milan. It is only from this date until about 1890 that we find instruments signed by him. Gaetano Antoniazzi, along with his sons Riccardo and Romeo trained Leandro Bisiach, and together with the Antoniazzis, Bisiach influenced the creation of a workshop environment that was to dominate early to middle 20th Century Italian violinmaking. The result of this highly successful business model was that Milan became a hotbed of skilled violinmakers. Under this system, many important 20th Century Italian violinmakers received their early training, among them Gaetano Sgarabotto, Giuseppe Ornati, Ferdinando Garimberti, Igino Sderci, Rocchi Sesto, Cipriano Briani, Giuseppe Pedrazzini, Camillo Mandelli, Ferriccio Varagnolo, Camillo Colombo, Vincenzo Cavani, Pietro Paravicini, Albert Moglie, Andrea Bisiach, Carlo Bisiach, Pietro Borghi, Mirco Tarasconi, Leandro Jr. & Giacomo Bisiach, Iginio Siega and Carlo Ferrario. Gaetano's work is good, original and spontaneous, but not always very careful. The varnish is yellow-brown or sometimes red-brown in colour. His labels were generally handwritten.

Plot The episode begins inside the BET headquarters with fictional president of entertainment Wedgie Rudlin holding the Monday staff meeting on Thursday and calling himself the \\"new, super-duper smart, Harvard University-educated President of Entertainment.\\" After asking staff members why he was hired, Rudlin says it's time to take BET in a new direction. After firing a board member, Rudlin tells his staff to make \\"The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show\\" happen. Following the opening credits, Uncle Ruckus is shown chronicling his life. His day typically starts at 4:45am with him praying to \\"The White Man\\" and for blacks. Ruckus denies being black, stating that he suffers from \\"Re-vitiligo\\" (the opposite of what Michael Jackson claimed he had), and applies an ointment composed of bleach and sulfur. Ruckus goes on to talk about his shrines to his white heroes including John Wayne and George H. W. Bush. He also mentions he works 32 jobs, including bus driver where he is ignored and insulted by the suburban kids: \\"These kids are pure human race.\\" Ruckus stops the Freeman brothers (the only kids who show him a shred of respect) from boarding: \\"This bus is for kids with a future!\\" Next Ruckus is seen at J. Edgar Hoover Elementary, working as a janitor, mopping the hall, bemoaning desegregation, and ranting about black people in education and films. After school Ruckus approaches Jazmine and asks if she is waiting for her father Tom, explaining to the camera \\"He married to a white woman, lucky son of a bitch\\". Tom arrives in a kilt and tells Ruckus of his Scottish heritage and how he took a DNA test that revealed he was 32.5% Scottish. Ruckus then visits a scientist and receives the results of his ethnic makeup. Midway through the scene, the action pans back to BET where Rudlin tells Debra Leevil (the same parody of BET CEO Debra L. Lee seen in the previous episode) to start BET animation in order to destroy the minds of black kids at a younger age. A board member shows Leevil his creation: \\"Super Cyborg Mandigo Man\\", with the script in flipbook form, showing a stick figure throwing a spear. Leevil, unimpressed because the show isn't evil enough, summons her associates, \\"Big Nigga\\" and \\"Crazy Bitch\\" to beat up the board member, who screams unsuccessfully for Rudlin to save him. Leevil then asks about the Uncle Ruckus show and Rudlin tells her it is. Leevil issues a threat of killing, or at least serious injury. On the show, Ruckus receives his DNA test results, which reveal that he is 102% African with a 2% margin of error; he retreats into a bed-bound depression and quits all his jobs and contemplates selling \\"crack\\" and doubts he has re-vitiligo and calls on the Freemans for advice on how to be black. Robert points out there's nothing wrong with being black. In a sports store (probably Foot Locker), Ruckus complains about no shoes named after white men. Afterward, while getting his hair cut, Ruckus jumps to the defense of U.S. president George W. Bush. Meanwhile, Rudlin kidnaps the doctor who gave Ruckus his results and forces him to send new results after unsuccessfully torturing him (the power for the building and the 'torture machine' went out, since the electric bill wasn't paid). Ruckus tries everything to adjust to his new status including reading Ebony Magazine and drinking malt liquor. Ruckus contemplates suicide but Rudlin arrives and prevents it. The scientist arrives, blames the \\"mistake\\" on a black intern, and reveals new results: Ruckus is 50.07% Caucasian. The episode ends with Ruckus, as a crossing guard, stating he has a \\"whole new perspective on life\\" and \\"a lot more sympathy\\" towards colored folks. Huey and Riley walk past and Ruckus assures them it's safe to cross, then lets a large truck drive towards them. The truck narrowly misses them, prompting Ruckus to laugh at their misfortune. Airing and BET This show and its preceding episode (\\"The Hunger Strike\\") were not initially aired on Adult Swim. A Cartoon Network representative stated that BET had not contacted Cartoon Network regarding the episodes.Brodesser-Akner, Claude. \\"Net-Bashing 'Boondocks' Banned.\\" Advertising Age, February 4, 2008. Retrieved on 08-02-08. Sony Pictures Television, which produces the series, has not issued a statement on the matter. The episodes are said to specifically attack Reginald Hudlin, BET's president of entertainment, and Debra Lee, president and chief executive officer of BET Holdings (parent company of BET.) Lee is portrayed as Deborah Leevil, a parody of the character Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies, and Hudlin is portrayed as Wedgie Rudlin, a \\"culturally insensitive buffoon coasting on his Ivy League education.\\" In this episode, Leevil is portrayed to be much like Doctor Evil from the Austin Powers movies, by placing her finger near her mouth when excited or emphasizing a statement or using the word \\"evil.\\" Leevil also speaks in much the same way as Doctor Evil. It is noted that Hudlin was responsible for producing The Boondocks with McGruder before serving as president of BET from 2005 to 2008, effectively ending the partnership between the two. McGruder is known to be very critical of the television network's work and programming.

He was the eighth son and pupil of Gaetano Antoniazzi. Antoniazzi was born in Cremona. Initially he worked with his father and brother and like them made instruments (of the violin family) for Leandro Bisiach. However, depending on need or opportunity he worked in many different places. He worked on his own, with his brother, for Bisiach, for Monzino, or in Barlassina’s shop. The unsettled aspect of his life influenced his work which was highly uneven in quality. His most interesting instruments, like those of his brother Riccardo, are from the late 19th century. He trained a large number of pupils. Despite the fact that his violin making was less refined than his brother’s (especially during his last period), he made instruments with distinct personality and great spontaneity which today are much admired. His varnish varied in colour and quality depending on the period, going from a light orange-yellow to an orange-brown, sometimes dark brown (often the varnish of his last period faded and his instruments sometimes appear lacklustre). He used various labels. Later on he used one with ‘fece in Cremona’ and decorated with the Cremonese coat of arms on it even though he never returned to his native city to work (he probably introduced it for business reasons and to distinguish himself from his brother). He died in Milan.

Release  The film's overseas theatrical distribution rights were acquired by Asian Movies and CineGalaxy, Inc. The film was initially scheduled for a Sankranthi release i.e. in mid January 2015. However, the film's release was advanced to 25 December 2014 as a Christmas release to avoid clash with Gopala Gopala. The film was awarded an 'U/A' certificate by Central Board of Film Certification on 19 December 2014 and the release date was locked as 24 December 2014. The film released in 75 theaters across United States and premiere shows were held on 23 December 2014.

Y. Sunitha Chowdary of The Hindu wrote \\"Since most of the story centres on the debate and dialogue, rather than an expected logical ending, it is likely that many regular cine goers will go home dissatisfied. But for those who appreciate truth, facts of life and intelligent conversations, this is a film smartly interspersed with action and village politics for today’s youth\\". Hemanth Kumar of The Times of India rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote \\"Every once in a while there comes a film, which stands apart from the rest in terms of the subject it explores and the tone of narrative, although the nuances might not be blatant. You know it's different because it tries to break free from the template of an action comedy, a genre that has become synonymous with Telugu cinema these days. Mukunda is exactly that kind of film and much more. It's a film which is so aware of the milieu that it's exploring that you get sucked into the narrative to have a ringside look at the complex characters that inhabit the canvas the story unfolds on.\\" Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle rated the film 3 out of 5 and stated \\"Finally it’s not a regular commercial film, a typical Srikanth Addala kind of film, without the double meaning dialogues and vulgarity\\". In contrast, IndiaGlitz wrote \\"Sans loudness and crassness, Mukunda has a scent of SVSC.

United States, 633 F. Supp. 912 (D. Nev. 1986), was a federal tax refund case, decided in 1986, regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the gambling income of a professional gambler. Because of this case, gambling winnings in the United States can in certain cases be treated as business income for federal income tax purposes. This means that in some cases expenses and losses can be deducted from gambling winnings in arriving at the net earnings from self-employment, and that winnings can be placed into retirement funds. History William E. (Billy) Baxter, Jr., had been a gambler since the age of fourteen. For the tax years in question (years 1978 through 1981), both Baxter and the government agreed that Baxter was engaged in the activity of gambling as a \\"professional gambler.\\" The parties agreed that Baxter devoted a substantial amount of time to his gambling activity, which was poker. Baxter was a pioneer in professional poker who later went on to win seven World Series of Poker bracelets. He was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2006. Between 1978 and 1981, Baxter claimed $1.2 million in gambling winnings. Background To Baxter, the 50% versus 70% maximum marginal tax rates meant the difference of $178,000. At first, Baxter refused to pay. His Certified Public Accountant, E.J. Maddocks, advised Baxter that to avoid potential penalties and interest, Baxter should instead pay the tax asserted by the government, and later sue the government for a tax refund. The preliminary issue presented to the trial court was whether Baxter, as a professional gambler, was engaged in a \\"trade or business\\" for federal income tax purposes. If Baxter was engaged in a trade or business, then his income would be taxed at what was then a maximum rate of 50% for \\"personal service income\\" (as that term was defined in the Internal Revenue Code at the time). If, however, Baxter was not engaged in a trade or business, the income would not be \\"personal service income,\\" and the maximum tax rate would be 70%. The tax law at the time defined \\"personal service income\\" to be \\"earned\\" income within the meaning of what was then section 911(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. The court noted that \\"if Baxter derived his gaming income actively from his expenditure of time, energy, and skill rather than passively from his use of his property, then his gaming income constitutes 'earned income'.\\" The trial court analyzed two alternative tests for determining whether an activity constitutes a \\"trade or business\\" for federal income tax purposes: the \\"goods and services\\" test, and the \\"facts and circumstances\\" test. The government conceded that if the \\"facts and circumstances\\" test was the appropriate test, then Baxter's activity would constitute a trade or business, resulting in the lower tax rate and a lower tax liability. Trial court ruling The Nevada judge who heard the case ruled in favor of Baxter, declaring \\"I find the government's argument to be ludicrous. I just wish you had some money and could sit down with Mr. Baxter and play some poker.\\" The court stated: > [ . . . ] the Court finds that capital was not a meterial -income-producing > factor in Baxter's gaming income. In fact, the Court finds that Baxter's > income was derived entirely from his personal services and that the capital > he used to finance his poker playing was merely a \\"tool of the trade.\\" The > money, once bet, would have produced no income without the application of > Baxter's skills. [ . . . ] it was Baxter's extraordinary poker skills which > generated his substantial gaming income, not the intrinsic value of the > money he bet.Baxter, 633 F. Supp. at 918-19. The trial court ruled in favor of Baxter's claims for tax refunds. Appeal When the government appealed the ruling to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, that court ruled in Baxter's favor. The government threatened to take the case to the United States Supreme Court, but eventually backed down. Impact Because of this case, gambling winnings in the United States can be treated as earned income for federal income tax purposes, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case. This means that in some cases expenses and losses can be deducted from gambling winnings in arriving at the net earnings from self-employment, and that winnings can be placed into retirement funds. The case of Baxter v. United States is currently being cited by opponents of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). Opponents of the UIGEA argue that because poker is a game of skill, the UIGEA does not apply to online poker sites.Bromberg, Gene This Guy Is A U.S. Senator? GeneBromberg.com May 1, 2007 Accessed 1 March 2008. Other countries Russia and Denmark have similarly declared poker to be a game of skill. In the Gutshot Poker Club case in England, the court ruled poker to be a game of luck and so subject to the Gaming Act (though this is currently under appeal).Hintze, Haley.

Brecht reportedly did not write a complete shooting script, but rather produced \\"notes\\" and \\"parts of a manuscript\\" (according to Faber) for this short, silent film and intended the actors to improvise the action.See \\"A Brecht- Valentin Production: Mysteries of a Barbershop\\", by W. Stuart McDowell, Performing Arts Journal, Vol. 1, No. 3 (Winter, 1977), p 4. Although the film was not considered a success by any of its creative team, and consequently never released as a profit making film to the public, it has been recognized and acknowledged—since its re-discovery in a Moscow archive in the 1970s—as a considerably important German film.\\"A Brecht-Valentin Production: Mysteries of a Barbershop\\", W. Stuart McDowell, Performing Arts Journal, Vol. 1, No. 3 (Winter, 1977), pp. 5.  \\"A Little Joke\\" by Bertolt Brecht  In an interview with Erwin Faber, who played Dr. Moras—the \\"romantic star\\" of the film—it was clear that Mysteries of a Barbershop was intended by Brecht in this, his first attempt at filmmaking, to be nothing more than \\"just a little joke.\\"\\"Acting Brecht: The Munich Years,\\" by W. Stuart McDowell, in The Brecht Sourcebook, Carol Martin, Henry Bial, editors (Routledge, 2000) p. 71 - 83. Mysteries of a Barbershop was created during a month-long pause before the beginning of rehearsals for Bertolt Brecht's early drama, In the Jungle of Cities at the Munich National Theatre, in February 1923. Brecht and Erich Engel (the director of In the Jungle), assembled a cast that included Karl Valentin, Liesl Karlstadt (Valentin's cabaret partner), Erwin Faber (the leading actor in Munich at the time and star of Brecht's three staged plays in Munich - Drums in the Night, In the Jungle of Cities, and the forthcoming Edward II), Max Schreck (soon to be a leading film actor in such films as Nosferatu), comic actor Josef Eichheim, character actor Kurt Horwitz, Carola Neher (later to play the lead in Brecht's Happy End and the role of Polly in the film of Threepenny Opera) and the cabaretist (and wife of songwriter, Friedrich Hollaender), Blandine Ebinger. The group improvised a series of comic and mock-romantic scenes, which, according to one critic, \\"contains enough cruelty jokes to have made WC Fields envious.\\"Acting in the Cinema, James Naremore. (Performing Arts, 1988), 115.  Plot  The plot revolves around Dr. Moras (Faber) who visits a barber (Valentin), who accidentally shaves Moras to look like a Chinese person, and then mistakenly cuts off Moras' rival's head (photo, above, right), which is sewn back on by the barber's assistant (Ebinger), and ends with a sword fight - \\"The Duel\\" - and in which Faber is triumphant (actually saved by the girl) and Ebinger and Faber embrace in a happy ending in a mysterious Senegalese Salon. The finale of Faber and Ebinger kissing illustrates one of Brecht's first uses of the mock-romantic \\"happy ending\\" that would become a signature of Brecht's work throughout the years of the Weimar Republic.For a detailed account of the plot of the film, as well as its creation, see \\"A Brecht-Valentin Production: Mysteries of a Barbershop\\", W. Stuart McDowell, Performing Arts Journal, Vol. 1, No. 3 (Winter, 1977), pp. 2-14.

He was a pupil of Romeo Antoniazzi in Milan, then began to work on his own there. He quickly gained recognition and won awards at various exhibitions, including those in Rome in 1920 and in Cremona in 1937. He modelled his instruments after various patterns, especially those of Stradivari, G.B. Guadagnini and Amati, all of which he interpreted freely. Tonally his work is among the best of the early 20th- century Italian makers. He was a meticulous and elegant craftsman; the scrolls of his instruments are always deeply carved, and the symmetrically rounded curves of the bouts and flanks provide a distinctive touch. Besides new instruments, he made a number of skilful antiqued copies. He used a variety of different labels and, depending on the period, one of three different brands. A good part of his output was exported, and he had particularly close ties with Hawkes & Son (later Boosey & Hawkes) in London. Among his pupils and associates were Ferdinando Garimberti, P.

According to the stratigraphy, the kouloura were all constructed around MM II (1850–1750 BC). Etymology The name kouloura was coined by Arthur Evans during his expedition to Knossos in 1903. He named the pits after kouloura, the round Greek bread, because of the similar shape of the two objects. Discovery and locations The first four kouloura were discovered in 1903 at Knossos by Arthur Evans. Subsequently, discovered eight additional kouloura at Mallia, and the duo of Luigi Pernier and Doro Levi unearthed four at Phaistos. These pits have always been found within the confines of major sites, including the West Court of Knossos and the Upper Court of Phaistos. Function Multiple theories have been put forward regarding the function of these kouloura in Ancient Minoan Society. However, there are only three majorly supported theories. * Arthur Evans, the original discoverer of the pits, theorized that they were garbage pits due to the lack of cement walling to prevent water seepage. * Chapouthier and Pernier believed that they were actually ancient cisterns, based on the presence of a long water trough in one of the kouloura at Knossos. However, the flaw in this theory remains that most of the pits contained no form of waterproofing, a concept which was familiar to other civilizations around this time period. * The most commonly accepted theory is that the kouloura were a type of granary to store excess harvest. This belief grew out of the fact that kingdoms during the Minoan period grew largely out of ability to store, maintain, and distribute food goods.

The song was written by husband-and-wife team Stephanie de Sykes and Stuart Slater. It was finally placed eleventh of the 20 entries, which at the time was the worst showing ever for a UK entry. It would not be until 1987 that any British song fared worse in Eurovision. The group were originally called Mother's Pride. Eurovision At the time, the group consisted of Terry Bradford, Josie Andrews, Cheryl Baker, Keith Hasler and Paul Rogers. For their performance in Paris, a drummer named Charlie Brennan was added to the group. They won the preliminary heat A Song for Europe, having previously placed second, again as a quintet, but with only Bradford, Hasler and Baker in the original line-up, together with Peter Perrera and another female singer, Vivien Banks (who would later join The New Seekers) when they appeared in the 1976 UK final, singing \\"Wake Up\\" written by the Arrows \\"I Love Rock N Roll\\" songwriting team of Alan Merrill and Jake Hooker. Perrera appeared in the 1976 contest with a shaved head, having promised his bandmates he would go bald if they made the final. Additionally, the group returned as a quartet (minus Andrews and Rogers, but with a new female singer Helen Bailey) as The Main Event, for the 1980 A Song for Europe contest. Oddly, despite this new line-up, Josie Andrews still appeared on stage with the group, providing backing vocals to the main quartet. On this occasion they placed last with the song \\"Gonna Do My Best\\", written by Bradford. Bradford also wrote a song for the 1979 UK final, \\"Harry, My Honolulu Lover\\", performed by The Nolan Sisters, which placed fourth. Stephanie de Sykes and Stuart Slater also won the A Song for Europe contest a second time, in 1980, with the song \\"Love Enough for Two\\" performed by Prima Donna, ironically beating the new line up of Co-Co in the process. Cheryl Baker in Bucks Fizz In 1981, Cheryl Baker returned to the UK contest, as part of the group Bucks Fizz. When Bucks Fizz won the UK final, Baker thus became only the third singer ever to represent the UK twice, following in the footsteps of Ronnie Carroll and Cliff Richard. When Bucks Fizz went on to win the 1981 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"Making Your Mind Up\\", Baker became one of the few artists to take part in Eurovision to win at their second attempt. According to The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History by John Kennedy O'Connor, Baker also made the second biggest improvement by a Eurovision competitor in the contest, moving up from eleventh in 1978 to first in 1981.O'Connor, John Kennedy.

Background and usage F.R. Larson and J. Miller proposed that creep rate could adequately be described by the Arrhenius type equation: :r = A \\\\cdot e^{-\\\\Delta H/(R \\\\cdot T)} Where r is the creep process rate, A is a constant, R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and \\\\Delta H is the activation energy for the creep process. Taking the natural log of both sides: :\\\\ln(r) = \\\\ln(A) - \\\\Delta H/(R \\\\cdot T) With some rearrangement: :\\\\Delta H/R = T \\\\cdot (\\\\ln(A) - \\\\ln(r)) Using the fact that creep rate is inversely proportional to time, the equation can be written as: :\\\\Delta l/\\\\Delta t = A' \\\\cdot e^{-\\\\Delta H/ ( R \\\\cdot T )} Taking the natural log: :\\\\ln(\\\\Delta l/\\\\Delta t) = \\\\ln(A') - \\\\Delta H/(R \\\\cdot T) After some rearrangement the relation finally becomes: :\\\\Delta H/R = T \\\\cdot (B + \\\\ln(\\\\Delta t)), where B = \\\\ln(A'/\\\\Delta l) This equation is of the same form as the Larson–Miller relation. :LMP = T \\\\cdot (C + \\\\log(t)) where the quantity LMP is known as the Larson–Miller parameter. Using the assumption that activation energy is independent of applied stress, the equation can be used to relate the difference in rupture life to differences in temperature for a given stress. The material constant C is typically found to be in the range of 20 to 22 for metals when time is expressed in hours and temperature in degrees Rankine. The Larson–Miller model is used for experimental tests so that results at certain temperatures and stresses can predict rupture lives of time spans that would be impractical to reproduce in the laboratory. Expanding the equation as a Taylor series makes the relationship easier to understand. Only the first terms are kept. :\\\\Delta LMP = \\\\frac{\\\\partial LMP}{\\\\partial T} \\\\cdot \\\\Delta T + \\\\frac{\\\\partial LMP}{\\\\partial \\\\log(t)} \\\\cdot \\\\Delta log(t) +\\\\cdots :\\\\frac{\\\\partial LMP}{\\\\partial T} = 20 + \\\\log(t) \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\frac{\\\\partial LMP}{\\\\partial \\\\log(t)} = T Changing the time, by a factor of 10, changes the logarithm by 1 and the LMP changes by an amount equal to the temperature. :\\\\Delta LMP = \\\\frac{\\\\partial LMP}{\\\\partial \\\\log(t)} \\\\cdot \\\\Delta \\\\log(t) = T \\\\cdot \\\\Delta \\\\log(t) = T \\\\cdot 1 = T To get an equal change in LMP by changing the temperature, the temperature needs to be raised or lowered by about 5% of its absolute value. :\\\\Delta LMP = T = \\\\frac{\\\\partial LMP}{\\\\partial T} \\\\cdot \\\\Delta T \\\\qquad \\\\Delta T = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta LMP}{\\\\frac{\\\\partial LMP}{\\\\partial T}} = \\\\frac{T}{(20+\\\\log(t))} \\\\approx \\\\frac{T}{20} =5\\\\% T Typically a 5% increase in absolute temperature will increase the rate of creep by a factor of ten.

It was a social distinction that existed alongside the racial categories of the sistema de castas. Indigenous peoples (indios or \\"Indians\\"), who maintained their culture and lived in their legally recognized communities (the repúblicas de indios), and mixed-race people (the castas), especially the poor in urban centers, were generally considered not to be gente de razón. Etymology The term is ultimately derived from Aristotelian and Roman legal ideas about the use of reason in persons and the status of minority before the law. Under Roman law many adults (women, grown men who were not heads of household) were deemed legal minors under the protection of a tutor (usually the pater familias). Additionally, in the early establishment of New Spain, indigenous peoples who converted and were baptized into the Catholic religion often adopted Christian first names and Spanish last names as signs of outward transformation. Colonial leaders used the term \\"gente de razón\\" (\\"people of reason\\") to distinguish these converted natives from unconverted ones. In Spanish America Since the sixteenth century the Laws of the Indies categorized Indians as minors under the protection of the Crown (cf. Dhimmi status in the Ottoman legal system). Slaves, and by extension all Blacks, were also legally deemed not to belong to the gente de razón. These groups were also excluded from the priesthood for most of the colonial period. In frontier regions such as Chile, Río de la Plata or the Provincias Internas, the category of gente de razón gained additional importance and it was interpreted differently than in the areas with a longer Spanish presence. Since the term was used to distinguish between acculturated people who lived in Spanish settlements (the repúblicas de españoles) from the gente sin razón (\\"people without reason\\"), or Natives who had not accepted Spanish rule or who lived on missions, it often included acculturated people who normally might not have been included. These areas were settled by Hispanized Indians from the older areas of Spanish settlement, Mulattos, Blacks and Mestizos, all who usually became gente de razón. Because of this, in the frontier areas mixed-race people had a greater chance of social mobility, and their descendants often became the elites of the region.

Trained in Cesare Candi's workshop, Paolo DeBarbieri is now considered one of the best violin makers of the school of Genova. His style changes greatly during the years, but it is always easy recognisable for his unmistakable making technique, based on the 'continuous' linings (the linings are not mitred or set in the central blocks, but pass over - two pieces only per plate instead of six). His workmanship is fine and inspired, and reveal very good taste and good technique.  Biography  At the age of 13, he left a note on his kitchen table stating \\"be back in a minute\\".....leaving for six years to work as a sailorboy. Upon his return, he frequently visited the workshop of Cesare Candi, becoming his first true pupil (soon after which he married a cousin of Candi's wife, becoming a part of the family). During his military service (in the Navy) in 1912, he participated in the famous Dardanelli Battle for which he received a medal. During this time, he also made guitars for the soldiers. The real beginning of his own career was in 1918-1919 (after the Great War), in a workshop located at Piazza Paolo da Novi 5/14. He won a great many awards and prizes including a Gold Medal 1929 in Barcelona, Silver Medal 1931 Padua. At the 1949 Cremona competition / Stradivari exhibit, he exhibited two violins, one viola and a quartet. For the quartet he was awarded a silver medal and a special prize (Gold Medal) assigned by the Executive Committee for the \\"best quartet made by a living Italian Violin Maker\\". He also won two Gold Medals in Rome at the competition held by the Royal Academy in 1954 and 1955 and 1956, where he won two silver medals and a prize in the bow category (he was also a gifted bow maker). Candi left a permanent imprint on both professional and amateur 20th-century Genoese violin making. Paolo de Barbieri entered Candi’s workshop when he was about 30, having previously been a sailor and soldier. He learnt external mould construction from Candi, as well as the use of continuous linings, which he employed throughout his life. He made more than 360 violins, as well as violas, cellos and guitars. In his early period he used his master’s Strad model, followed later by a personal Strad model with narrow f-holes and round archings; but his main model was the ‘Cannon’ Guarneri ‘del Gesù’, which since Praga had been a steady reference for all Genoese makers. De Barbieri’s place in Candi’s workshop was taken in 1924 by a talented young woodworker called Giuseppe Bernardo Lecchi (1895–1967), originally from a southern Piedmontese village. \\"Lecchi proved the ideal partner for Candi and made a considerable contribution to his last series of decorated instruments, taking charge of the delicate inlays.\\"Alberto Giordano&C., Paolo de Barbieri It is necessary to point out the importance of the world-renowned 'del Gesù' of Paganini \\"Il Cannone\\" for every violin maker of Genoa. De Barbieri's interpretation/copy stands out amongst them. Paolo de Barbieri's son Renato de Barbieri (1929–1991) was a well-known concert violinist/soloist.

The main entrance is in Judd street with its northern elevation extending along Euston Road, opposite the main front of St Pancras railway station. It has been Grade II listed since 1996. History In the early 20th century the borough council was based at the 19th century vestry offices in St Pancras Way which had been commissioned for the Parish of St Pancras. After civic leaders found that the vestry offices were inadequate for their needs, they elected to construct a purpose- built facility: the site selected on Euston Road had previously been occupied by some Georgian terraced housing. The new building was designed by Albert Thomas, who also designed housing schemes for the St Pancras Borough Council, in the neoclassical style. The construction which was undertaken by Dove Brothers of Islington involved a steel frame clad with Portland stone and the work started in 1934. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with 13 bays facing onto Judd Street; the central section of three bays featured three doorways on the ground floor; there were three windows on each of the first and second floors flanked by huge Corinthian order columns supporting a pediment. A carving of the borough coat of arms was erected above the central window on the first floor. The design for the Euston Road frontage involved 23 bays with two sections designed in a similar style to the Judd Street elevation i.e. with windows flanked by huge Corinthian order columns supporting pediments. Internally, the principal rooms were an assembly hall on the ground floor in the east of the building and the council chamber and mayor's parlour on the first floor in the west of the building. The building was officially opened in October 1937. A \\"Caribbean Carnival\\", a precursor of the Notting Hill Carnival, was held on 30 January 1959 in the town hall, organised by activist Claudia Jones as a response to the 1958 Notting Hill race riots and the state of race relations in Britain at the time. A few months later, on 27 May 1959, Princess Margaret attended a meeting of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in the town hall. The building served as the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras and continued to operate as the local seat of government after the formation of the London Borough of Camden in 1965. An eight-storey extension designed by the borough architect's department was built to the east of the main building in 1977. It was designed in a modern architectural style and was clad in white pre-cast panels with curved window corners. A rooftop conservatory was added in the 1990s. In February 2020 the council started a programme of refurbishment works to plans prepared by Purcell. The works, which are being managed by Lendlease at an estimated cost of £40 million, involve restoration of the historic areas used by the council and the redevelopment of the basement and upper floors so those floors can be let out as commercial space.

Located just northwest of the mouth of the Columbia River, it is historically significant for several reasons. Captain Robert Gray, the first non-native to enter the river, saw it from Chinook Point in 1792. In 1805, it was the site of an encampment by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. It has been the site of military fortifications since 1864, most notably in the late 1890s, when most of the presently surviving Fort Columbia structures were built. The point, which constitutes the most developed portion of Fort Columbia State Park, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. and Description and history Chinook Point is a hilly promontory on the north bank of the Columbia River, roughly east of its actual mouth, which is marked on the north by Cape Disappointment and the south by Point Adams. The point is fortified with the remains of Fort Columbia, which include thirteen buildings erected in 1902, and three artillery emplacements installed between 1897 and 1900. The mouth of the Columbia River, the major river of the northwestern United States, was almost discovered several times before Captain Robert Gray spotted it in 1792. Spanish explorer Bruno de Heceta saw both Cape Disappointment and Point Adams, but illness aboard ship prevented him from exploring further, and his ship was then driven out to sea by currents. Heceta recorded his opinion that there was a river mouth in the vicinity. British Captain James Cook explored the coastline in 1778, but missed the entrance bay entirely due to bad weather. In April 1792, Captain George Vancouver also sailed the area, but did not see the river mouth. Also in April 1792, Captain Gray made note of the strong currents, but was unable to enter the river mouth. He returned in May, and succeeded in entering the river on May 11. This formally established an American claim to the region that withstood later challenges. Gray made a landfall near Chinook Point to trade with the local Chinook people, for whom the point is named. When the Lewis and Clark Expedition was organised in the early 19th century, the river named Columbia by Gray was one of its objectives. The expedition reached Chinook Point in November 1805. The area became of military interest in the 1860s, when the United States embarked on a systematic improvements to its coastal defenses, including in the Pacific Northwest. A military reservation was established at Chinook Point in 1864, but was not significantly developed. It was not until 1898, when both the Spanish–American War and heightened tension with Britain over the Alaska boundary dispute prompted formal development. Chinook Point is now part of Fort Columbia State Park, which is in turn part of the Lewis and Clark National Historical Park, a series of preserved sites commemorating the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

Serving with Honor: The Diary of Captain Eathan Allen Pinnell p.28Holliday, Hampden. Indianapolis and the Civil War p.28 Shoup was serving as a leader of an Indianapolis Zouave militia, but once the Civil War started, he moved to Florida to fight for the Confederacy, proclaiming he had \\"aristocratic inclinations and admiration for the South.\\". This shocked those in the Indianapolis militia, who had loved him as friend, and even gave him a special set of revolvers with holsters and trappings, believing he would serve in the Union army, and that officers would always ride horses and thus would need such a set. All Indianapolis reported of the incident was that Shoup had resigned from the militia.Francis Asbury Shoup, CsaHolliday 29 In 1860, he moved to St. Augustine, Florida, where the Governor commissioned him a Lieutenant. He was actually admitted to the bar in Florida, although whether he actually practiced law is obscure. War life At the Battle of Shiloh, he served as chief of artillery under William J. Hardee. In the summer of 1862 he started serving in Arkansas as Inspector General under Major General Thomas C. Hindman. On September 12, 1862, the First Confederate Congress made him a brigadier general, after which he commanded Hindman's Second Division. After the Battle of Prairie Grove, he went back across the Mississippi River. After he was captured in the Battle of Vicksburg, he met some compatriots from his Indianapolis militia days, but they rejected him for fighting for the Confederacy. After he was paroled, he went to Georgia and fought in the Battle of Atlanta. He designed a defensive line and, following its approval by General Johnston, oversaw the construction in late June 1864 of what would become known as Johnston's River Line. The Shoupades Riverline.org Shoup's design consisted of what would eventually total 36 unique forts later called \\"Shoupades.\\" While the River Line was deemed an engineering success, its potential force was negated when General Sherman's army crossed the Chattahoochee north of the line. Johnston's River Line is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. During the war, he wrote texts on infantry and artillery drill and advocated for blacks to serve in the Confederate Army. He also served as Chief of Staff for the commander of the Army of Tennessee, John Bell Hood.Banasik 39 Post-war After the war, Shoup became a professor at the University of Mississippi, and later, at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. Shoup was also an Episcopal rector and wrote books about mathematics and metaphysics. While he was a professor, Shoup wrote \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin, Forty Years After\\" (1893), an essay for the Sewanee Review that considered the impact of Harriet Beecher Stowe's antislavery novel. Shoup initially praises Stowe's book for its broad circulation, but then he laments the loss of a patriarchal system for controlling black people while also expressing relief that white southerners are free of the burden of their slaves.Elizabeth Ammons, ed.

Innovator, personality and pioneer of the great rebirth of contemporary Bolognese violinmaking, Fiorini was born at Musiano di Pian di Macina di Pianoro near Bologna. He spent his early years in Bazzano, where he learned the first elements of the craft while working with his father at the 'Mulino della Sega'. A famous violin player and teacher, Professor Verardi, induced him to start the 'Bolognese adventure' and to open a workshop in the Palazzo Pepoli, not far from the Liceo Musicale, in Bologna downtown. Fiorini quickly achieved a reputation in his new environment and was able to attract apprentices of great talent, including his son Giuseppe. Raffaele won a silver medal with praise during the International Music Exhibit of Arezzo in 1882, and a silver medal during the Torino Exhibition in 1884; he received also great acclaim for his restoration work. Modern Bolognese Violin-Making Table, doubleclick to enlarge it Biography Up to the first half of the nineteenth century, violin making in Italy had come to a standstill, but during the second half of the century, Raffaele Fiorini gave new impulse to it. Thanks to him, born in Musiano di Pianoro, the luthier's ancient Art was brought back to a new life. He took by himself several apprentices who, in their turn, continued his tradition with good success during the following century. One can say that today any Bolognese luthier has his roots in this school. These are among the best bowed instrument makers of the 20th century in Italy: Augusto Pollastri, first of this renowned luthier family, started his career as an apprentice in Raffaele Fiorini's studio. Augusto showed a remarkable artistic gift and took the firm's responsibility upon himself when Raffaele, towards the end of his life, could not manage the workshop. After Raffaele Fiorini's death Augusto Pollastri managed one of the most important luthier's Atelier in Bologna for thirty years, helped also by his brother Gaetano. Augusto's total production was not very high in number, yet it was of an astounding quality and class. Pollastri's instruments are today considered legendary and the model developed by him is one on the most copied in the world, besides the classical ones. In fact the number of fake instruments and imitations one could come across is much greater than the number of originals. Gaetano, Augusto's brother, continued after his death, reaching very good results too. Brothers Candi (Oreste & Cesare) worked in Genoa, yet they are considered Raffaele Fiorini's pupils in all respects; above all, Cesare who gained distinguished international fame not only in bowed instrument making but also in plucked instruments, refined inlaying and carving. Armando Monterumici was another Bolognese artist who apprenticed in the same workshop during the last years of the 19th century and who deserves to be known better; in fact his production is today quite rare to find. Giuseppe, son of Raffaele, quickly achieved a solid reputation and today he is certainly considered one of the most important Italian violin makers. Cremona too should be grateful to this scholar who, after forty years of essays, bought the rest of Stradivari's workshop (shapes, tools, original drawings, models) and donated them upon the city, in order to form a lutherie school which could bring again Italy at the top of the bowed instrument making world. Ansaldo Poggi was Giuseppe Fiorini's favourite pupil. His instruments are among the most sought-after and expensive instruments today on the market. Certainly this is also due to the school he had with Fiorini, to which Poggi, when alive, has always been proud to have been part of. Carlo Carletti of Bologna would have been one of Fiorini's last pupils. Fiorini mentored Carletti during the last years of his life. Carletti's instruments are well known for its rich sound and precise workmanship. Following Fiorini's death, Carletti formed a strong bond with Ettore Soffritti, Augusto Pollastri and Giuseppe Fiorini. Last but not least, Otello Bignami, teacher of the greatest part of the professional luthiers now living and working in Bologna; his memory is still very vivid among them who knew him.

From 1917 to 1919, she served as chair of the U.S. National Defense Advisory Commission's Committee on Women in Industry. 1919 to 1937 Harriman participated in the Versailles Peace Conference, and upon her return was an advocate for American participation in the League of Nations, and worked on behalf of world peace organizations.

One such cohabitant in the first year of the Roosevelt Administration was the first woman cabinet member, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins. As a member of the Democratic National Committee, Harriman was also a District of Columbia delegate to the Party's conventions. In 1932, when the Convention nominated Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harriman did not support him. According to Time, \\"she unfortunately held out for Newton D.

At the time of her appointment, she could hardly have known that this role would soon require her to draw on her experience in helping refugees in the previous World War. Consequently, increasing tension in Europe and the imminent death of Turkish reformer Atatürk, compelled her to advise Secretary of State Hull to install Ismet Inonu as President of Turkey to assure a protectionist ally in the region. In 1940, Germany invaded Norway with little warning, causing Harriman and the rest of the American legation in Norway to join certain members of the Norwegian royal family and other refugees seeking protection hundreds of kilometers away in Sweden.J. Michael Cleverley, \\"'The First American Official Killed In This War,'\\" Foreign Service Journal, December 2003 at 66; \\"'Daisy' Harriman Outruns Bombs,\\" Life, 1940-05-14, at p. 32. In the chaos and bombardment, America suffered its first military casualty when Captain Robert M. Losey, a U.S. military attaché assisting the evacuation while observing the war, was killed in a Luftwaffe attack on Dombås. The rest of the American legation ultimately arrived safely in Sweden. Harriman is credited with arranging for the safety of other Americans and several members of the Norwegian royal family -- Crown Princess Märtha and her children Ragnhild, Astrid and Harald.Norway.org - the official site in the United States: A New Princess in Town, 9/28/2005 She returned to the Nordic countries to complete the evacuation of current and future U.S. citizens through Finland on the United States Army transport in August 1940.SS American Legion,\\" in Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships; \\"'American Legion' Docks with Royal and Plebeian Refugees,\\" Life, 1940-09-09 at 30.

Her service in Norway, and the harrowing escape, became the subject of her next book, \\"Mission to the North,\\" published in 1941. In July 1942, King Haakon VII of Norway (then in exile) conferred upon Harriman the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav.\\"Norway's King Gives Honor to U.S. Minister,\\" Wisconsin State Journal, 1942-07-31 at p. 8. After the United States entered World War II, Harriman continued to write on causes important to her, and wrote the foreword to the English-language edition booklet of Natalia Zarembina \\"Oswiecim, Camp of Death,\\" originally published in occupied Poland in 1942 by the PPS WRN.Natalia Zarembina, \\"Obóz śmierci\\", Wydawnictwo WRN, Warszawa 1942.

And despite her decades of involvement in the Democratic Party, she joined a bipartisan (but unsuccessful) effort to persuade Roosevelt's Republican opponent in the 1940 election, Wendell Willkie, to run for Governor of New York in 1942.Ellsworth Barnard, \\"Wendell Willkie: Fighter for Freedom\\" 330-31 (U. Mass. Press 1971) . In 1952, she campaigned on behalf of her cousin by marriage, W. Averell Harriman, in his unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination for President.\\"Talking it Over: Pre-Convention Differences Bring Family Opinions to Attention,\\" Syracuse Herald-Journal, 1952-06-19 at 40. She served as the 3rd Vice President of the Board of Directors of the National Conference On Citizenship in 1960. Voting rights in the District of Columbia Harriman lived in the District of Columbia at the time of every presidential election since the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920, but the District received no electoral votes for most of her life, so she effectively could not vote in presidential elections for several decades.Associated Press,\\"'Daisy' Harriman Dies: Democratic Party Legend,\\" Meriden (CT) Journal, 1967-09-01 at p. 3. In 1955, at age 84, Harriman led a parade through the capital to protest \\"taxation without representation\\" in the District of Columbia. That year, she wrote in a New York Times letter to the editor that \\"the time has come for another Boston tea party\\" to end the disenfranchisement of the District's residents. The adoption of the Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1961 gave three electoral votes to the District, so in 1964, at age 94, Harriman cast her first vote in a presidential election – for Lyndon Johnson. In 1956, Life Magazine reported that, even at age 86, she continued to host dinners for twenty-two guests nearly every Sunday night.\\"Earned Place in Politics: Important Role of the Hostess,\\" Life Magazine, 1956-12-24 at p. 55. Citation of Merit Harriman received a Citation of Merit for Distinguished Service, presented by President Kennedy on April 18, 1963 (when she was 92 years old). It states: > In her illustrious career in public service, Mrs. Harriman has made singular > and lasting contributions to the cause of peace and freedom. . . . In all of > her endeavors, Mrs. Harriman has exemplified the spirit of selflessness, > courage and service to the Nation, reflecting the highest credit on herself > and on this country. She has, indeed, earned the esteem and admiration of > her countrymen and the enduring gratitude of this Republic.  Death and descendants  Harriman died at her home in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., on August 31, 1967. Her daughter died on July 4, 1953, at age 55. Her granddaughter, Phyllis Russell Marcy Darling, of Eugene, Oregon, died on December 18, 2007, at age 88.

It was founded in 1999 by Rachel Levitsky as a reading series at Bluestockings in New York, NY. The reading series quickly expanded to a matrix of readings, publications, and informal salons, featuring avant-garde feminist writing, with an emphasis on hybrid and language-focused writing. Currently, the press operates as a non-hierarchical collaborative, publishing books and hosting literary events with attention to diversity in its roster of authors and editorial board.  History  Belladonna* was started as a reading and salon series at Bluestockings (bookstore) on New York City's Lower East Side in August 1999. The first publications were postcards by kari edwards for the May 4, 2000 reading at Bluestockings (bookstore). Following the edwards postcards, and in collaboration with Boog Literature, Belladonna* began to publish commemorative \\"chaplets\\" (staple-bound pamphlets typically with fewer pages than a chapbook, produced in very small print runs) of its readers' work. In 2006 Belladonna* published chapbooks by Erica Hunt and Akilah Oliver and co-published its first full-length book, Four from Japan: Contemporary Poetry & Essays by Women, in collaboration with Litmus Press. The following year, Belladonna* published its first full-length books independently: Open Box by Carla Harryman and Mauve Sea-Orchids, a book of poems in Spanish and English with facing page translations, by Lila Zemborain (translated by Rosa Alcalá and Mónica de la Torre). In celebration of its ten-year anniversary in 2009, Belladonna* published The Elders Series—eight multiply authored perfect- bound books highlighting the continuity and transformation of the ideas, poetics, and artistic/political concerns of its poets' circle. Each book was conceived as \\"an anthology and a conversation between the guest curator and the elder(s) she hosts.\\" Since 2009, Belladonna* has published, on average, two full-length books and 14 chaplets a year.  Awards  In 2009, Bharat Jiva by kari edwards (co-published with Litmus Press) was a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award in Transgender Literature. Erica Doyle's Proxy was a 2013 finalist for the Lambda Literary Award in Lesbian Poetry and a winner of the Poetry Society of America's Norma Farber First Book Award in 2014. LaTasha N. Nevada Diggs was a winner of the 2016 Whiting Award for TwERK. Cancer Angel by Beth Murray won the California Book Award for Poetry in 2016. In 2015, Sophie Seita won a PEN-HEIM Translation Grant for her translation of Uljana Wolf's Subsisters. In 2016, an excerpt of Subsisters won second place in Asymptote's Close Approximations Translation Contest.  Readings  The Belladonna* reading series is foundational to the press's history and mission, predating even the first publications. The series is run by the reading series curators. Since 1999, curators have included Marcella Durand and Rachel Levitsky, erica kaufman, Emily Skillings, Krystal Languell, Jamila Wimberly, Cara Benson, Ariel Goldberg, LaTasha N. Nevada Diggs, Saretta Morgan, Chia-Lun Chang, Ana Paula, and Asiya Wadud. Belladonna* collaborates on the series with performance venues, academic institutions, arts and literary organizations, such as Abrons Art Center, Asian American Writers' Workshop, Berl's Brooklyn Poetry Shop, BGSQD, Bluestockings, Bowery Poetry Club, Brooklyn Art Library, Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Public Library, Bryant Park Reading Series, CUNY Graduate Center, Dixon Place, Eugene Lang College, Housing Works Bookstore, La Casa Azul Bookstore, Lambda Literary, The Lesbian Herstory Archives, McNally Jackson, The Poetry Project, Pioneer Works, Pratt Institute, Queen's College, St. Mark's Bookstore, Unnameable Books, and ZieherSmith. Belladonna* documents its reading series through audio and visual recordings, as well as through the production of short-run chaplets for each of its readers. There are over 230 individually numbered chaplets in the series. The majority are single-authored pamphlets of under 15 pages. Several chaplets are multiply authored and many contain both texts and images. The chaplets are produced in a limited run of 150 copies. When copies sell out, Belladonna* uploads a reading PDF of the chaplet so that the out-of-print work is freely available. All of Belladonna's readings are recorded and available for streaming or downloading at PennSound, an online project committed to preserving audio archives of poetry. Many of Belladonna's readers and chaplet authors are noted poets and writers, such as: Fanny Howe (#5), Mei-mei Berssenbrugge (#8), Lynne Tillman (#19), Anne Waldman (#26), Rosmarie Waldrop (#29), Alice Notley (#36), Lydia Davis (#40), Elaine Equi (#41), Maggie Nelson (#42), Anne Tardos (#47), Michelle Naka Pierce (#48), Leslie Scalapino (#50), Caroline Bergvall (#56), Susan Howe (#68), Lisa Robertson (#75), Ann Lauterbach (#85), Myung Mi Kim (#86), Dawn Lundy Martin (#89), Marjorie Welish (#91), Rae Armantrout (#92), Anna Moschovakis (#102), Evie Shockley (#104), Jean Day (#114), Dodie Bellamy (#116), Bhanu Kapil (#28 and #127), Eileen Myles (#38 and #128), Cecilia Vicuña (#131), Carmen Giménez Smith (#132), Renee Gladman (#65 and #133), Juliana Spahr (#144), and many others.

His work on molds was a precursor to the formal discovery of penicillin and resulted in compounds which he used to treat patients at least one year before the re-discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming. He wrote over 115 works, mainly books and monographs. Biography =Early life= Picado was born in April 1887 in San Marcos, Nicaragua to Clodomiro Picado Lara and Carlota Twight Umaña, who both had Costa Rican citizenship. In 1890, when Picado was 2 years old, he and his parents moved to Cartago, Costa Rica. He then attended San Luis Gonzaga high school, graduating in 1906. Due to his excellent grades, he was granted a scholarship to study in France, where he later studied at the University of the Sorbonne and received his diploma in Zoology in 1909. In 1910, he returned to Costa Rica, but left shortly after to continue his studies. He received his diploma with superior studies in Botany. Picado received the academic rank of Doctor in science in 1913, and that same year he was admitted to the Pasteur Institute and the Colonial Institute of Paris. In 1915, he published \\"Anales del Hospital de San José\\", a quarterly medical publication in Costa Rica.Dr. Clodomiro Picado Twight: Biografía =Death= In 1944, after an ailment Picado died. Dr. Picado was declared \\"Meritorious of the Motherland\\" () by the Costa Rican Congress, by means of decree no. 34 of 21 of December 1943. Investigation and findings The scientific work of Dr. Picado was prolific and very extensive; it is calculated that he wrote about 115 research papers in his lifetime, delving into nearly all aspects of his environment: soil, flora, fauna, human tissues, water, and others. Among them are included books and monographs. His work covered topics of zoology, botany of bromeliads, ophidism, physiology, phytopathology, industrial microbiology, medical microbiology, and immunology. In March 2000, doctors from the San Juan de Dios Hospital in San José, the capital of Costa Rica, published his manuscripts, in which he explains his experiences between 1915 and 1927 with the inhibiting action of fungi of the Penicillium genus in the growth of Staphylococci and Streptococci (bacteria that cause a series of infections). In 1927, he demonstrated the inhibitory action of the bacillus genus Penicillium on the proliferation of the bacteria Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Although, the discovery of penicillin has been attributed to Alexander Fleming, Picados' old laboratory notebooks from 1923 show records of the antibiosis of Penicillium sp. For this reason he is renowned as one of the precursors of the penicillin antibiotic. The report with the results of the treatments performed with penicillin by Dr. Picado were published by the Biology Society of Paris in 1927. Honors and recognition Statuette awarded to the winners of the Costa Rican National Award of Science and Technology \\"Clodomiro Picado Twight\\" In memory of Dr. Picado's outstanding scientific work, since 1977 the Costa Rican Ministry of Science and Technology (MICIT), together with the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport (MCJD) grant annually the National Award of Science and Technology \\"Clodomiro Picado Twight\\", as stimulus and recognition for the prominent scientific and technological work of Costa Rican citizens. The prize was modified in June 2000, and divided into the following two categories a year later: *National Award of Science \\"Clodomiro Picado Twight\\" *National Award of Technology \\"Clodomiro Picado Twight\\" Both prizes are awarded annually. The winners become creditors of a commemorative statuette of Dr. Picado, a parchment and a prize in cash. Picado was featured on the 2,000 colónes bill, banknote of Costa Rica. In 2000, Picado's daughter-in-law, Lolita González Picado, accepted the Gold Medal awarded posthumously to Picado by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). There are several institutions and places in Costa Rica named in Picado's memory: * Clodomiro Picado Research InstituteInstituto de Investigación Clodomiro Picado in Dulce Nombre de Jesús, Vázques de Coronado, San José.

He learned the Gwalior gharana (singing style) and brought it to Maharashtra. Early life and background Balakrishnabuwa Ichalkaranjikar was born in Maharashtra. He travelled to Gwalior, then the Mecca of Khayal genre of Indian classical music, and learned under Vasudeorao Joshi. He then returned to Maharashtra, and settled near Miraj because its climate suited him. Soon Miraj and the area near it became a major hub of Hindustani classical music and has remained so for more than 100 years. It is a combination of conducive cultural climate, the aptitude shown for classical music by people in the area, and tireless efforts of teachers among whom Balakrishnabuwa, being the first to bring the gayaki to western India, deserves to be put on a special pedestal. Disciples Buwa's slow, majestic singing was marked by gravitas. His chief disciples include Neelakanthbuwa Mirajkar, Vishnu Digambar Paluskar, his own son Annabuwa, Anant Manohar Joshi (Antu-buwa), Mirashi buwa and Vamanbuwa Chafekar. Annabuwa predeceased him. His son's death caused him great sadness in his final years. Legacy While he had some reservations about his disciple Paluskar's efforts towards popularising music, Paluskar played a major role in expanding the appeal of classical music to common folks. Most other styles of singing have had their origins in Gwalior Gharana because it was among the earliest styles to take root and enjoy wider popularity.

These tropical marine reef-associated fishes are omnivore, eating worms, mollusks, and tunicates, sponges, corals and algae, and they are also known to eat other fishes' eggs. Adults prefer areas with rich coral growth. The juveniles are particualrly common on shallow waters of reefs. In the aquarium In captivity they may reach a maximum size around 30 cm.

Dr. Louis La Caze (6 May 1798 – 28 September 1869Dates and other biographical details are drawn from the brief notice by C. Gavard, published in the Journal des débats (19 October 1869) and reprinted as an appendix to Frédéric Reiset, Notice des tableaux légués au Musée national du Louvre par M. Louis La Caze (Paris, 1875), pp 75ff.) was a successful French physician and collector of paintings whose bequest of 583 paintings to the Musée du Louvre was one of the largest the museum has ever received.The La Caze Collection, exhibition, Musée du Louvre, 2007. Among the paintings, the most famous are likely to be Pierrot (also known as Gilles) by Antoine Watteau,The painting had belonged to Dominique Vivant Denon, director of the Musée Napoléon, precursor of the Louvre. during the First Empire, or Rembrandt's Bathsheba at Her Bath. Born to a family of social standing, he retreated to simple rooms in the Latin Quarter of Paris. A dedicated student devoted to the theory of medicine, he demonstrated during the cholera epidemic of 1831-32 that cholera was not directly transmissible, by sharing the quarters of a dying patient. He was afterwards presented with a medal of honor. As he found himself in no want of fortune, he drew his practice from among the poor, pro bono, and lived a life of extreme simplicity and privacy. In 1852 he retired altogether from hospital work, discouraged at the lack of progress being made against tuberculosis and typhoid fever among the working class. In addition to his bequest to the Louvre, he left funds for the study of these two endemic diseases. The bequest to the Louvre did not come as a surprise. For decades Dr. La Caze, who was an amateur painter himself, had haunted minor dealers in second-hand bric-a-brac, paying modest prices for paintings that were not in the mainstream of fashion and were not easily nursed through the cumbersome vetting process that led to official purchases for the Louvre. His taste was for realists and for domestic subjects that were not among the theatrical conventions of official classicism that was in vogue. As the rest of the art world caught up, La Caze was to be seen haunting the Paris auction houses. La Caze's salon in the rue du Cherche-Midi was open to progressive artists such as Degas and Manet or François Bonvin, who were training their manner on close examination of painters like Velázquez, whose Portrait of the Infanta Marie-Therese (1653) was in La Caze's collection, and Jusepe de Ribera, at a time when the Spanish school of painting was largely ignored in French official circles.La Caze's mother was Spanish, a connection that might have triggered his interest in Spanish painting, suggests Guillaume Faroult, the curator at the Louvre who has completed a modern catalogue of the collection: (\\"Louis La Caze: Doctor who put Louvre's experts to shame\\" ). La Caze, who had four of Fragonard's fancy pieces, his Portraits de fantaisie, also had an eye for the still largely unappreciated work of Jean-Baptiste- Siméon Chardin: Chardin's Le Bénédicité, found in a quai-side flea market, was among the first purchases that hung on the doctor's walls, and Chardin's simple choices in still life and his sober colour, animated Dr La Caze's own efforts at painting. Some 250 of La Caze's paintings were retained at the Louvre, while the rest were distributed among the provincial museums of France.

West Virginia's geologic history stretches back into the Precambrian, and includes several periods of mountain building and erosion. At times, much of what is now West Virginia was covered by swamps, marshlands, and shallow seas, accounting for the wide variety of sedimentary rocks found in the state, as well as its wealth of coal and natural gas deposits. West Virginia has had no active volcanism for hundreds of millions of years, and does not experience large earthquakes, although smaller tremors are associated with the Rome Trough, which passes through the western part of the state. Precambrian origins Extent (orange regions) of the Grenville orogeny, after Tollo et al. (2004) and Darabi (2004). This illustration shows mountain building regions, but Grenvillian basement rock extends all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. The basement rock of West Virginia was formed during the Grenville orogeny, approximately 1,140 to 980 million years ago, when the land mass today known as Laurentia, the ancestral North American craton, collided with other land masses to produce the supercontinent known as Rodinia.Richard T. Williams, William M. Dunne, and Lynn Glover III, \\"Global Geoscience Transect 20–Central Appalachians: Cratonic North America to the Atlantic Abyssal Plain,\\" in International Geology Review, Vol. 41, No. 8, pp. 711–738 (1999). The heat and pressure of this collision melted the existing rock, some of which was pushed down into the mantle, while a high chain of mountains formed on the surface. As these mountains eroded, the underlying layers of granite and gneiss were pushed upward by heavier mantle rocks, and exposed at the surface. This Grenvillian basement rock underlies substantially all of the Appalachian region, from the Ohio valley to the sea, and extends north and south into eastern Canada and Mexico, as well as a part of the Scottish highlands.Thomas M. Gathright, II, \\"Geology of the Shenandoah National Park, Virginia,\\" in Virginia Division of Mineral Resources Bulletin 86, p. 47. (1976). Geological map of the Mid-Atlantic states Today, the crystalline igneous rocks of the Grenvillian basement form the core of the Blue Ridge Mountains, also known as the Pedlar formation, where they are exposed. To the west, they are hidden beneath the Valley and Ridge and Appalachian Plateau, while to the east they extend under the Piedmont, coastal plain, and continental shelf. Over hundreds of millions of years, erosion formed a layer of sediment known as the Swift Run formation, extending over substantially all of West Virginia.West Virginia Geological and Economic Survey, Generalized Stratigraphic Chart for West Virginia (2014). Although Rodinia began to break up between 850 and 750 million years ago, it was not until about 600 million years ago that the Iapetus Ocean began to open up between Laurentia and its neighbors along the region uplifted during the Grenville orogeny. At that time, the craton was rotated approximately 90° clockwise from its present orientation, and was located south of the equator. The rifting process thinned the crust and led to volcanic activity, resulting in a layer of basalt, today known as the Catoctin formation, burying the existing ridges and valleys.Richard P. Tollo, James McLelland, Louise Corriveau, Mervin J. Bartholomew (ed.), \\"Proterozoic tectonic evolution of the Grenville orogen in North America,\\" in The Geological Society of America Memoir No. 197, p. 454 (2004).John C. Reed, Jr., \\"Ancient Lavas In Shenandoah National Park Near Luray, Virginia,\\" Geological Survey Bulletin No. 1265 (1969). Little of West Virginia's ancient history can be seen at the surface. Only in the extreme eastern panhandle is the Precambrian core of the Blue Ridge Mountains exposed. Except for intrusives, all of the rocks occurring above the Catoctin and Swift Run formations are of sedimentary origin, and most date to the Paleozoic Era. Paleozoic Era By the Cambrian Period, approximately 541 to 485 million years ago, a shallow sea had spread westward over most of what is now West Virginia. Marine deposition took place throughout most of this and the succeeding Ordovician Period. During this total interval of about 370 million years, most of the rocks today exposed in Jefferson and eastern Berkeley counties and in scattered areas southwestward along the boundary were deposited. Rocks of the same age are found in abundance in the deep wells throughout the State. The Taconic orogeny near the end of Ordovician time formed a high mountainous area east of West Virginia. Near the end of Devonian time, the sea was rapidly retreating westward and the continental red beds of the Hampshire Formation were being deposited over most of the State. The last significant period of marine deposition was the Greenbrier Formation, predominantly limestone, approximately 330 million years ago. About 310 million years ago, the area of West Virginia was once again above sea level, but covered by vast areas of swamp. This condition prevailed for more than fifty million years, resulting in the deposition of thousands of feet of non-marine sandstone and shale, as well as the many important coal seams that we know today. The Appalachian Orogeny began roughly 270 to 225 million years ago, building the present-day Appalachian Mountains. Most of the state was uplifted, important deposition of sediments ceased, and a gradual process of erosion commenced. Details The Taconic orogeny near the end of Ordovician time formed a high mountainous area east of West Virginia. These highlands formed the main source of sediments for the succeeding Silurian Period and part of the Devonian Period. Both clastics and carbonates were deposited in a mixed marine and nonmarine environment, with clastics predominating in the eastern part of the State. Evaporites were deposited in northern West Virginia in Late Silurian time. During Middle and Late Devonian time the Acadian Orogeny, with the main uplift to the northeast, resulted in a further source for the predominantly clastic marine deposits of these epochs. However, near the end of Devonian time, the sea was rapidly retreating westward and the continental red beds of the Hampshire Formation were being deposited over most of the State. The sea made one more important intrusion into West Virginia during Middle Mississippian time, approximately 330 million years ago, resulting in the deposition of the Greenbrier Formation, predominantly limestone, the last marine deposit of significance in the State. At the close of Mississippian time, about 310 million years ago, West Virginia was essentially a land area, subject to erosion. Early in the succeeding Pennsylvanian Period, the area dropped to near sea level and for more than 50 million years continued to sink at about the same rate that deposition was taking place. Only occasionally and for very short periods of time did the area fall below sea level. Swamp conditions prevailed, resulting in the deposition of thousands of feet of nonmarine sandstone and shale and the many important coal seams that we know today. During the Permian Period, roughly 270 to 225 million years ago, the Appalachian Orogeny began. West Virginia was uplifted, important deposition of sediments ceased, and erosion began taking place. Much folding and thrust faulting occurred, especially in the eastern part of the State. This orogeny played a major part in the formation of the Appalachian Mountains as we know them today. Never again has the sea invaded West Virginia. Almost no sedimentary rock from the Mesozoic Era is present in West Virginia. In other parts of world, rocks of this age, which extended from 225 to 66 million years ago, contain the remains of countless species of dinosaurs and other reptiles; such fossils are virtually unknown in West Virginia. During the early part of the era, considerable igneous activity took place in neighboring states to the east. A few dikes of gabbro and other mafic rock from the Jurassic Period, 210 to 145 million years ago, are present in Pendleton and surrounding counties. In the Cenozoic Era, which extended from 66 million years ago to present day, igneous activity was renewed in the eastern part of the State. Approximately 45 million years ago, a complex of dikes and sills with compositions ranging from basalt to rhyolite were intruded into the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in the area in and around Pendleton County. These unusual igneous rocks are some of the youngest in eastern North America. Late in the Cenozoic Era, in fact extending to less than 100,000 years ago, glaciers covered the northern part of the North American continent, extending almost to the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia, but not into the State. Prior to the advance of these ice sheets, drainage of the Monongahela River was northward to the St. Lawrence River system. The ice sheet caused damming and a lake extended as far south as Weston. Important lake deposits, predominantly clay, were thus laid down in the Monongahela River basin. Drainage was diverted westward into the Ohio River system. Divergence of the New River system that formerly drained northwestward caused the deposition of similar deposits in the old Teays River channel between Charleston and Huntington. Except for recent alluvial deposits, there are no other known Cenozoic rocks. The oldest evidences of life found in West Virginia occur in rocks about 600 million years old, in the Antietam Formation of Lower Cambrian age. However, in this formation they are abundant and of forms that had already developed through a substantial part of all evolution that has taken place during the history of the earth. Evidences of life in other parts of the earth are found in rocks at least 3 billion years old. Fossils are found in increasing abundance and increasing stages of evolutionary development in the rocks of all ages since earliest Cambrian time.Article provided by the 'West Virginia Geological and Economic Survey.'

In addition the district operated two bus mechanic stops, with the Pine Bluff one serving the majority of the district and the Altheimer one moving children from the Altheimer area to the schools in Pine Bluff. The Arkansas Department of Education took control of the school district in 2012 due to failing to meet state education guidelines. In 2014 state control ended and the school board resumed operations. State control resumed in 2015 due to low test scores. The State of Arkansas designated the school district as being in \\"academic distress\\" from 2011 until 2016, and after an audit found issues in financial reporting, in April 2016 the Arkansas Board of Education also ruled that the district was in \\"fiscal distress\\". the Dollarway School Board exempted the district from a state law that normally allows parents in one school district to have their children sent to attend schools in another school district. Parents from seven families, including the president of the Dollarway Parent Teacher Organization, Annie Bryant, argued against the exemption; Bryant stated that due to the large number of students on free or reduced lunch, it was clear that the students had no other choice but to go to public schools, and therefore the district ought to allow transfers. As of that year there were no persons requesting that their children be transferred from another school district to the Dollarway district.

Early life Spindler was born in Łódź, Poland, to an ethnic German family. He was the son of Gertrud Alma (née Bernewitz) and Oskar Karl Spindler; his father was a businessman. Spindler was considered part of the Volksdeutsche by the Nazi regime, and after the German invasion of Poland in 1939 was required to join the Deutsches Jungvolk (part of the Hitler Youth). When Germany's Eastern Front collapsed in 1944, Spindler and other children of Łódź were evacuated to a rural estate north of the city. In January 1945, he and his companions were forced to flee west on foot to escape the advancing Red Army; many of them were killed by starvation, exposure, or bombing raids. Spindler was eventually reunited with his family in Magdeburg, and they settled in Weißenfels, Saxony-Anhalt, which became part of the Soviet occupation zone and later East Germany. He was blacklisted from attending university due to his anti-Soviet views, and at the age of 17 was granted permission to move to Australia, sponsored by a relative who had settled in Melbourne.SPINDLER, SIEGFRIED EMIL (1932–2008), Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate. In Australia, Spindler became an apprentice with a painting and decorating company. He became an Australian citizen in 1952. After completing his apprenticeship, he opened his own business, which rapidly grew in size. He also began studying part-time at the University of Melbourne, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1967. He sold his business in 1973 to become an administrator with the Outer Eastern Regional Council for Social Development, which had been created by the Whitlam Government. He moved to the Northern Territory in 1978, becoming business manager of the Alice Springs Community College; he later worked as a youth advisor for the NT government.

He was Victorian state president of the Democrats from 1985 to 1989 and a national vice-president from 1987 to 1990. He was elected as a senator for Victoria in 1990, serving from 1 July 1990 to 30 June 1996 and managing a range of shadow-ministerial portfolios, as was mandatory for all Democrat parliamentarians. In parliament he spoke in support of the rights of Aborigines, refugees, prisoners, pensioners, taxpayers and the environment. He also spoke and campaigned against child labour and sexual discrimination. He retired from the Senate at the end of his term in 1996. Spindler's relationship with Janet Powell, then leader of the Democrats, was used as leverage to remove Powell from the leadership in 1991. Later life Spindler and his family established the Towards a Just Society Fund in 2002, which distributes $200,000 annually to help Aboriginal students.

Converted from the captured German freighter Aenne Rickmers, the ship's two aircraft conducted aerial reconnaissance, observation and bombing missions in the Eastern Mediterranean and Red Sea during 1915–17 even though the ship was not commissioned into the Royal Navy until mid-1915. She was decommissioned in late 1917 and became a Merchant Navy collier for the last year of the war. Anne was sold off in 1922 and had a succession of owners and names until she was scrapped in 1958. Description Anne was long, had a beam of , and a draught of . She was rated at . The ship had one propeller shaft powered by one triple-expansion steam engine that used steam generated by an unknown number of coal-fired boilers. Anne had a maximum speed of .Gardiner and Gray, p. 67 Career The merchant ship SS Aenne Rickmers was built by Rickmers of Bremerhaven in 1911. On the outbreak of war in August 1914, she was seized whilst in Port Said, Egypt and was requisitioned for service under the Red Ensign of the British Merchant Marine in January 1915 to operate seaplanes. No special modifications were made to the ship; the aircraft were stowed on the aft hatch covers and handled with her cargo booms.Turncoat Carriers, p. 287 Aenne Rickmers operated two French Nieuport VI.H floatplanes that had been off-loaded by the ; they were flown by French pilots with British observers.Layman, p. 40 For the first two months of 1915, the ship and her aircraft supported Allied operations in Syria, Palestine and the Sinai Peninsula. Aside from reconnaissance duties, they delivered and recovered Allied agents as well as observed for ships performing coastal bombardments. On 4 March, Aenne Rickmers was ordered to join several Allied ships that were going to bombard Smyrna, Turkey. A week later, she was torpedoed by the Turkish torpedo boat Demir Hisar. The ship was hit by one torpedo in the Number 1 cargo hold; this was full of timber which limited water ingress and saved her from sinking. Aenne Rickmers arrived at Mudros the following day to begin repairs, but the repair crew was withdrawn a week later to work on the damaged battlecruiser . The seaplane carrier (another merchant conversion) arrived on 20 March to load her aircraft and crew, leaving only a five-person skeleton crew behind. During a storm on 6 April, the ship dragged her anchors and ran aground on a sandy beach. She was temporarily repaired there and refloated on 12 May, sailing to Alexandria, Egypt two days later for permanent repairs and to off-load her cargo. This was completed by 18 June, but the ship lay idle until the end of the month when she was provided with an Arab crew and sailed to Port Said. Aenne Rickmers rendezvoused with the French armoured cruiser on 18 July at Scarpanto and the carrier searched the Turkish coast for U-boat bases and observed while the French ship bombarded coastal installations. The ship then returned to Port Said where she was fitted with a 12-pounder gun. Aenne Rickmers was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 5 August 1915 and renamed HMS Anne the same day.Colledge and Warlow, p. 16 She rendezvoused with Jeanne dArc and the French pre-dreadnought battleship around 13 August and observed while they bombarded Turkish installations in Haifa. On 17 August, aircraft from both Anne and Raven II spotted for Jeanne dArc as she bombarded Tarsus and then assisted Jeanne dArc and Jauréguiberry on 30 August as they captured Ruad Island.Turncoat Carriers, pp. 287, 289 In early September, the ship assisted the French as they evacuated Armenian troops and civilians from Alexandretta and the surrounding area and then resumed her earlier work of reconnaissance and espionage. Anne lost her first aircraft when it suffered an engine failure whilst on a reconnaissance mission over Beersheba on 9 October. The ship had her bottom cleaned in Alexandria during November and lost another aircraft, again over Beersheba, on 22 December. In January 1916, she was assigned to the East Indies and Egypt Seaplane Squadron together with the carriers , and Raven II. The squadron was under the command of the General Officer Commanding, Egypt and its primary duty was to watch Turkish positions and movements in southern Palestine and the Sinai in early 1916. Around 17 April, Anne was attacked by two German aircraft, but was not damaged. A few days later, she discovered a U-boat base at Makry, whilst operating near Kastellorizo. The ship loaded aboard the French seaplane contingent in Egypt at the end of the month, and delivered it to Malta on 9 May for transfer, including her own Nieuports, to the . Her aircraft had made a total of 118 flights since she began operating them in January 1915 and only two had been lost.Turncoat Carriers, pp. 289–90 Later that month, Anne exchanged her existing 12-pounder for an anti-aircraft gun of the same calibre and was back at Port Said by 21 May. She lay idle there until mid-June when she began transporting military supplies between Port Said and several ports in the Red Sea. This lasted until 2 August when she embarked British seaplanes,Turncoat Carriers, p. 290 including Short Type 184, Sopwith Schneider and Baby floatplanes, and she observed for the on 10 August as the latter ship bombarded Mersina. The East Indies and Egypt Squadron reassembled in late August with Raven II, Anne and Ben-my-Chree and the aircraft from the three carriers attacked the Turkish supply dump at El Afule for thirty minutes. The squadron then steamed south along the Palestinian coast where they encountered two Turkish supply dhows. One was sunk by the escorting while the other was captured. The squadron flew off seven aircraft that attacked an encampment at Bureir and a nearby railroad viaduct. One of Annes seaplanes was lost during this mission and the pilot was captured. Despite the loss, her aircraft bombed Turkish installations at Tull Keram, Nablus, Ludd and Ramleh before returning to Port Said on 27 August.Turncoat Carriers, pp. 290–91 A few days later, Anne replaced Raven II, after that ship had been damaged by an air attack on 1 September, on an expedition into the Red Sea to support the Arab Revolt against the Turks. She rendezvoused with the elderly cruiser and Dufferin of the Royal Indian Marine (RIM) and they arrived at Rabigh on 9 September. The ship briefly ran aground off Yenbo, but got off and was able to observe for Fox and Hardinge of the RIM as they shelled Turkish positions near Wejh on 13 September. Aside one brief visit to Suez to recoal, Anne remained in the area while her aircraft flew bombing and reconnaissance missions until she was relieved by Raven II on 26 October. The ship was idle at Port Said for the rest of the year other than one trip to Cyprus transporting coal. In January 1917, Anne returned to the Red Sea and joined Hardinge and the Armed boarding steamer Suva. Together with some 500 Arabs, the crews of the three ships made an amphibious landing and captured Wejh. The ship returned to Suez on 27 January and seems to have been used only as a collierTurncoat Carriers, pp. 291–92 until she was paid off on 8 August.Layman, p. 41 =Commercial service= Anne served as a collier under the Red Ensign from 29 January 1918 until the end of the war under the management of F. C. Strick and Co. She was sold in 1922 to S.N. Vlassopoulos of Greece and was renamed Ithaki. The ship was sold to a Romanian company in 1939 and renamed Moldova; she was then transferred to Panamanian registry in 1942 with the same name. Moldova was sold in 1949 to Wallem & Co. and renamed Jagharat in 1954. She resumed her former name of Moldova in 1955 and arrived at Hong Kong to be scrapped on 8 November 1958.Turncoat Carriers, p. 294 Notes References   External links * HMS Anne on Hazegray.org World War I merchant ships of Germany Ships built in Bremen (state) 1911 ships Seaplane carriers of the Royal Navy World War I aircraft carriers of the United Kingdom ","title":"HMS Anne (1915)"},{"id":"16049896","text":"Tom Abdo (April 12, 1894 - March 1967) was a poker player inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 1982.

It also has jurisdiction over many political matters, such as the formation and closure of political parties, jurisdictional boundaries between government entities, and the eligibility of persons to stand for public office. It also adjudicates in disciplinary proceedings against judges and state prosecutors. It is the court of second instance in actions against the decisions of authorities. Similarly to other countries in Europe, administrative justice is considered a separate branch of the judiciary in the Czech Republic. History The modern SAC can trace its origins back to Bohemia and Moravia under the Austro-Hungarian Empire. From the mid-19th century until the formation of Czechoslovakia, Czech rights with respect to administrative law were safeguarded by the Verwaltungsgerichtshof, or Austrian administrative court, which sat in Vienna. The Administrative Courts of the Czech Republic and Austria thus have a common ancestor. The Czechoslovak Republic set up its own administrative court which continued to function until the Czech coup of 1948, whereupon it lingered as a theoretical institution for a few years until it was wholly disbanded in 1952. In 1991, the Czechoslovak Federative Republic implied that it would set up a new administrative court in Article 36 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms, but failed to do so in its brief existence. The government of the Czech Republic not only renewed their commitment to this Charter in the constitution, they also specified that the court of highest authority on administrative matters would be called the Supreme Administrative Court, as it had been in the Austro-Hungarian period. However, many of the specifics about the SAC were deferred to \\"later statutes\\". The Parliament did not bring such legislation into force until 1 January 2003, when it passed law 150/2002, the Code of Administrative Justice. It is this document, more than perhaps any other, which actually returned a working administrative court to the regions of Bohemia, Moravia and Czech Silesia. Since 2003, the SAC has been characterized by a growing case load amidst understaffing and the search for a permanent location. The latter was finally accomplished in late 2006, when the court moved out of rented office space and into its new, permanent headquarters on Moravian Square (') in Brno. Simultaneously, the Parliament has paid more legislative attention to the SAC, giving greater definition to the scope and powers of the court through several statutes.Official History of the Supreme Administrative Court References Government of the Czech Republic Administrative courts Judiciary of the Czech Republic ","title":"Supreme Administrative Court of the Czech Republic"},{"id":"16050043","text":"Paulina Eliana Veloso Valenzuela (born in Concepción, Chile, February 14, 1957) is a Chilean lawyer and Socialist Party politician who served as the Minister Secretary-General of the Presidency of Chile (also rendered as the president's Chief of Staff in English) from March 11, 2006 to March 27, 2007.

Life under the Pinochet regime After the Chilean coup d'état of Augusto Pinochet on September 11, 1973, Veloso's fiancé at the time (and later husband), Alexei Jaccard Siegler, was detained and tortured by agents of the DINA. In 1974, the two escaped together for an exile in Switzerland. On May 15, 1977, during a trip to Buenos Aires, Jaccard was detained in the name of Operation Condor for Chilean and Argentine agents. He was moved to the ESMA internment camp, tortured, and later was disappeared. Paulina Veloso lived in Switzerland for many years, where she obtained dual nationality, and finally returned to Chile in 1979. Veloso studied law at the Universidad de Concepción, graduating with the highest distinction. She was sworn in as a lawyer before the Supreme Court of Chile in 1987. Principally dedicated to the academic life, she has served as the chair of civil law at the Universidad de Chile School of Law in Santiago from 1991 until the present. She also served as member of the Council of the Faculty. Government service With the return of democracy to Chile at the beginning of the 1990s, Veloso began to work in various public offices, including Undersecretary of Labor and chief of staff in the Ministry of Labor and Social Security (Ministerio del Trabajo y Previsión Social) from 1990-1994, Deputy Director of the National Women's Service (Servicio Nacional de la Mujer) from 1994-1997.

Converted from the captured German freighter Rabenfels, the ship's aircraft conducted aerial reconnaissance, observation and bombing missions in the Eastern Mediterranean and Red Sea during 1915–17 even though the ship was not commissioned into the Royal Navy until mid-1915. She fruitlessly searched the Indian Ocean for the German commerce raider in mid-1917. Raven II was decommissioned in late 1917 and became a Merchant Navy collier for the last year of the war. She was sold off in 1923 and had a succession of owners and names until she was sunk during the Second World War while under Japanese ownership. Description Raven II was long, had a beam of , and a draught of .Layman, p. 41 She was rated at 4,706 GRT. The ship had one propeller shaft powered by one quadruple-expansion steam engine that used steam generated by an unknown number of coal-fired boilers. Raven II had a maximum speed of .Gardiner and Gray, p. 67 Career The German freighter SS Rabenfels was built by Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson and completed in December 1903. On the outbreak of war in August 1914, she was seized by the British authorities whilst in Port Said, Egypt and was requisitioned for service under the Red Ensign in January 1915 to operate seaplanes. No special modifications were made to the ship; the aircraft were stowed on the aft hatch covers and handled with her cargo booms.Turncoat Carriers, p. 287 Aenne Rickmers operated two French Nieuport VI.H floatplanes that had been off- loaded by the ; they were flown by French pilots with British observers. Later, the ship operated included British Short Type 184, Sopwith Schneider, Sopwith Baby and Short Admiralty Type 827 floatplanes.Layman, pp. 40, 43 For the first two months of 1915, the ship and her aircraft supported Allied operations in Syria, Palestine and the Sinai Peninsula. Aside from reconnaissance duties, they delivered and recovered Allied spies as well as observed for ships performing coastal bombardments. Around 20 March, Rabenfels arrived in Mudros to load the aircraft and crew of the damaged Aenne Rickmers (later HMS Anne). The ship was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 12 June 1915 and renamed HMS Raven II. On 17 August, both Anne and Raven II spotted for the French armoured cruiser as she bombarded Tarsus. In January 1916, she was assigned to the East Indies and Egypt Seaplane Squadron together with the carriers , and Anne. The squadron was under the command of the General Officer Commanding, Egypt and its primary duty was to watch Turkish positions and movements in southern Palestine and the Sinai in early 1916.Turncoat Carriers, p. 289 At the end of March, Raven II was sent to the Red Sea to attack Turkish troops threatening Aden; she carried one two-seat Short floatplane and five Sopwith Schneiders for this operation. After a preliminary reconnaissance mission, on 2–3 April her aircraft dropped ninety-one bombs as well as leaflets urging the Arab auxiliaries to desert. The ship returned to the Syrian coast for patrols and was transferred to Kastellorizo in early July to conduct aerial reconnaissance and bombing missions in that area. Raven II was transferred to the Gulf of Aqaba later that month to take aerial photographs of the head of gulf as well as the east coast of the Red Sea. Her aircraft observed for the monitor as she bombarded a Turkish encampment in the Sinai. One aircraft was forced to land, but it was taken in tow by the monitor and delivered back to Raven II.Turncoat Carriers, p. 290 The East Indies and Egypt Squadron reassembled in late August with Raven II, Anne and Ben-my-Chree and the aircraft from the three carriers attacked the Turkish supply dump at El Afule for thirty minutes. The squadron then steamed south along the Palestinian coast where they encountered two Turkish supply dhows. One was sunk by the escorting while the other was captured. The squadron flew off seven aircraft that attacked an encampment at Bureir and a nearby railroad viaduct. Raven II was then sent to the Adalia area on the Turkish coast where her aircraft bombed a factory at Fineka and searched for U-boat basesTurncoat Carriers, pp. 291 On 1 September, the ship was in Port Said preparing for another sortie into the Red Sea when she was hit by a bomb dropped by a German aircraft (probably the first successful air attack on an aviation vessel). Although Raven II was only lightly damaged, Anne was sent in her place. Raven II relieved Anne on 26 October in the Red Sea and her aircraft bombed Turkish forces advancing on Rabigh and Yenbo on 10 December. Shortly afterwards, the ship was transferred back to the Eastern Mediterranean where her aircraft attacked a bridge over the Ceyhan River with one bomb and eight bombs on 27 December. On 10 March 1917, Raven II and the sailed for the Indian Ocean to hunt for the German Q-ship Wolf. For this mission she carried a Short Baby and two Short 184s. The two ships searched the Laccadive Islands en route to Colombo, Ceylon, which they reached on 2 April. They then searched the Chagos Archipelago and the Maldive Islands and returned to Colombo. Engine problems forced a Short 184 to make an emergency landing on 21 April in the Maldives; the crew rejoined the ship on 6 May after a series of adventures that inspired Rudyard Kipling's story \\"A Flight of Fact\\".Turncoat Carriers, p. 292 Raven II recovered the floatplane and its aircraft continued to fly search missions from Colombo until 21 May. She then joined a convoy bound for Egypt and arrived back in Port Said on 10 June. In early November, the ship's aircraft observed fire for a variety of ships during the Third Battle of Gaza. =Commercial service= HMS Raven II was paid off shortly afterwards and, renamed Ravenrock, served as a collier under the Red Ensign from January 1918 until the end of the war under the management of Grahams & Co. She was sold to British Dominion Steamship Co. in 1923 and resold later that year to Karafuto Kisen Kabushiki Kaisha (KKK), which renamed her Heiyei Maru No. 7. In 1935, the ship was sold to Inuri KKK and she was renamed Heiei Maru No. 7 in 1938.

He won the FA Cup three times in the 1870s and made two appearances for England in 1874 and 1875. Career =Winchester College= Birley was born in Chorlton-on-Medlock, Manchester, the son of Thomas Hornby Birley J.P. (1815–1885) and Anne Leatham (1820–1866). His uncle was Hugh Birley, who became Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Manchester from 1868 to 1883. At the age of 13, Birley started at Winchester College where he remained until 1868. He was an all round sportsman who played for the school at both cricket and football. As a cricketer, in 1867 he took 7–73 as the college beat Eton College, and in 1868 as captain he took 4–41 and 2–25. He was also a keen athlete and was the school champion at the pole vault and high jump. =Oxford University= Oxford University's F.A.

He was one of the first to study Law separately at Oxford (it had previously been taught as a joint honours degree with modern history). He was not a great academic, achieving only a third class Bachelor of Arts degree in 1872, although he was more successful as a sportsman. In his time at Oxford he threw the hammer against Cambridge University in 1872 and represented the university at football. As a cricketer, although he played in the fresher's match he did not get a game for the University, although he did win a University College cup in 1871 for throwing the cricket ball with a distance of 107 yds 2 ft 1 inch.

The following year, he played for Oxford University in the first ever varsity football match against Cambridge University, finishing on the winning side in a 1–0 victory. In 1873–74, Oxford University again reached the final, and this time were victorious, defeating the Royal Engineers 2–0. The match was played at Kennington Oval on 22 March 1874, Birley's 22nd birthday. Birley's first England cap came against Scotland on 7 March 1874, when \\"the Scots managed a 2–1 victory to avenge their 1873 defeat\\". =Wanderers= By now, Birley was had joined the Wanderers side, making his first appearance for them on 21 October 1873. In 1875 he was one of several Wanderers players selected to meet Scotland at Kennington Oval on 6 March.

In 1875–76, he was a member of the Wanderers team that reached the FA Cup Final for the third time in its five-year history, scoring in the semi-final against Swifts. This was his only goal for the Wanderers. In the final, Wanderers met the Old Etonians at the Kennington Oval; Birley was now the captain of the team. The first match ended in a 1–1 draw, with the Wanderers victorious 3–0 in the replay on 18 March. The following season, Wanderers were again victorious in the Cup Final, defeating Oxford University 2–1, with Birley again the team captain. He made a total of 32 appearances for the Wanderers between 1873 and 1877; his last game was the 1877 FA Cup final. He also played representative football for London and Middlesex. =Cricket career= Birley was described as \\"a moderate right-hand batsman and a useful slow right-arm bowler, an excellent field. He was said to possess excellent judgement as a captain whilst at Winchester\\". Although he played in the fresher's match he did not get a game for Oxford University. He did however play for Lancashire, making his first appearance in a first-class match against Hampshire on 21 July 1870 when he took three wickets, helping Lancashire to win by ten wickets. He played twice more for Lancashire in the summer of 1870, and once in 1872. He also made one appearance for Surrey in 1879. His first-class career took in five matches and eight innings in which he scored 65 runs, whilst he took four wickets as a bowler. Most of his cricket was played for Cheshire.

Recurving to the northeast, the hurricane briefly threatened Louisiana before turning toward Florida. Early on September 29, the hurricane made landfall near Fort Walton Beach, Florida, with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). Once over land, the cyclone rapidly weakened and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before dissipating on September 30\\\\. Some islands in the Lesser Antilles experienced strong winds and heavy rainfall, including Dominica, Guadeloupe, and Saint Lucia. In Jamaica, the hurricane caused significant damage to banana and coconut plantations. Communications from Holland Bay were disrupted when the station was demolished.

In Nueva Gerona, Cuba, strong winds destroyed well-constructed buildings and all but 10 homes. The Isla de la Juventud overall experienced about $2 million (1917 USD) in damage and there were at least 20 fatalities. Orchards and crops were destroyed on the Pinar del Río Province. In Louisiana and Mississippi, impact was generally limited to damaged crops and timber stands. Ten deaths from drowning were reported in Louisiana. Farther east in Mobile, Alabama, portions of roofs, trees, and other debris littered streets. Communications were severed in Pensacola, Florida.

Once over land, the system rapidly weakened to a tropical storm within 12 hours. Early on September 30, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Georgia after merging with a frontal system. About six hours later, the remnants of the hurricane dissipated. The minimum atmospheric pressure of 928 mbar (27.42 inHg) established the cyclone as the third most intense landfalling Cuban hurricane. Deeper pressures of 921 mbar (27.23 inHg) and 915 mbar (27.02 inHg) were measured in the 1924 and 1932 hurricanes, respectively. The cyclone (949 mbar; 28.02 inHg) was also the most intense tropical cyclone in the Florida Panhandle until Hurricane Opal (942 mbar; 27.82 inHg). At the time, it was tied with an 1882 storm, which also had a central pressure of 949 mbar (28.02 inHg) at landfall in northwest Florida. Preparations and impact =Caribbean= On September 21, the United States Weather Bureau issued advisories because of strong swells in the Leeward Islands, indicating the presence of a tropical disturbance. The system produced heavy precipitation and strong winds in the eastern Caribbean islands. In Jamaica, the hurricane caused significant damages to banana and coconut plantations. Communications from Holland Bay were disrupted when the station was demolished. The greatest damages were reported from the northern half of the island. At Port Antonio, the custom house was destroyed, while a hotel was severely damaged. Nine deaths occurred in the city. In Nueva Gerona, Cuba, severe winds destroyed well constructed buildings, devastating the town. Only ten homes remained standing. At a large plantation, every building but the house was destroyed. Nearly all of the chickens on the property were killed during the storm. Throughout Isla de la Juventud, damage reached approximately $2 million. The island's food supply was also ruined. Offshore, a number of ships capsized or went missing, resulting in \\"many\\" deaths. There were at least 20 fatalities on the island, while other accounts state that there were hundreds killed. Orchards and crops were destroyed on the Pinar del Río Province. A relief committed issued an appeal for aid to then-Cuban president Mario García Menocal and Americans. At the Burnside Hotel, among few buildings were demolished, a soup kitchen was opened to feed storm victims. =United States= Rainfall totals (in inches) in the United States On September 23, northeast storm warnings were issued for the Florida coast from West Palm Beach to Boca Grande. On September 25, the Weather Bureau advised marine traffic to remain alert in the Gulf of Mexico, noting that the intensity of the storm was unknown. Later, hurricane warnings were issued from Apalachicola, Florida, to Mobile, Alabama, on September 25\\\\. Warnings were also released from Pascagoula, Mississippi, to New Orleans, Louisiana, on September 26\\\\. The warnings were briefly discontinued because of track uncertainties, but they were re-issued when the cyclone began to curve northeast. On September 27 and September 28, scheduled vessel trips were cancelled in New Orleans, Louisiana. Marine traffic resumed after the storm passed east of the city. The storm struck the Gulf Coast later than anticipated because of slow forward motion. In Louisiana, rain bands produced 6.40 in (160 mm) of rain in Burrwood. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad sent trains on alternate routes because of eroded tracks near Lake Catherine. The effects of the cyclone also damaged crops and timber stands in Louisiana and Mississippi. The storm surge associated with the hurricane moved several structures from their foundations in Buras, Louisiana. There, the storm was blamed for the death of an 8-year-old boy. Nine additional fatalities occurred near Houma after the fishing bark Wanna was wrecked. In Biloxi, warnings prevented considerable loss of shrimp boats. Street cars and other traffic were practically suspended in Gulfport. In Alabama, more than 5 in (125 mm) of rain was measured in Montgomery, prompting flood advisories for the lower Alabama River watershed. At Camp Sheridan, a United States Army World War I training camp, the streets were inundated with at least a few inches of water. In Mobile, trees and telephone and telegraph wires were downed, cutting off communications. Roofs were detached and the galleries of houses were torn away. Police stopped the streets cars were operating and shut off the electricity. No boats from the area were lost, and waterfront damage was negligible. The hurricane severed communication from Pensacola, Florida, though reports eventually indicated that the wireless radio plant was not destroyed. Several small watercraft washed ashore, including the USS Quincy, and numerous wharves, docks, and boat storages received damage. Total damages reached about $170,000 in the vicinity of Pensacola. Near the city, a portion of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad was underwater, while several of their bridges washed away. At Valparaiso, tides reached above normal. Significant destruction of timber occurred in Okaloosa and Santa Rosa counties, and crops, structures, and livestock were affected. Strong winds occurred along the southwest coast of Florida, and a wind gust of 44 mph (70 km/h) was reported in Jacksonville. A total of five people were killed in Crestview. The storm and its remnants also produced rainfall in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.

The western edge of the passage is a line from Cape Jervis on Fleurieu Peninsula to Kangaroo Head (west of Penneshaw) on Kangaroo Island.BIA, 2005, page 184 The Pages, a group of islets, lie in the eastern entrance to the strait. About 14 km wide at its narrowest, it was formed by the rising sea around 13,000 years ago, at the end of the Pleistocene era, when it submerged the land connecting what is now Kangaroo Island with the Fleurieu Peninsula. Backstairs Passage was named by Matthew Flinders whilst he and his crew on HMS Investigator were exploring and mapping the coastline of South Australia in 1802. Discovery and exploration Backstairs Passage was named by Matthew Flinders on 7 April 1802 whilst he and his crew on HMS Investigator were exploring and mapping the coastline of South Australia. Flinders noted that this body of water is separate from Investigator Strait and that \\"it forms a private entrance, as it were, to the two gulphs; and I named it Back-stairs Passage.\\"Flinders (1966) [1814], p. 262 On 6 June 1995, South Australian marathon swimmer Andrew Martin completed the first recorded solo crossing of Backstairs Passage, covering the 14.25 km distance in 4 hours 31 minutes 30 seconds.Bye, John A.

South Australian Geographical Journal, Vol. 95, 1996: 70-74. Like most Oceanic parts of South Australia, Backstairs passage is named after a part of a courtroom. Maritime history The coastal processes occurring in Gulf St Vincent and along the southern coastline of Fleurieu Peninsula are complex. Due to the relatively shallow Gulf St Vincent joining the Southern Ocean through the deeper Backstairs Passage, this narrow and dangerous channel is subjected to strong currents, heavy tidal swells and steep breaking seas. In the early years following European colonisation many of the nearly fifty vessels wrecked in the hazardous waters around Kangaroo Island were lost while crossing Backstairs Passage to and from the mainland. This led to South Australia's first lighthouse, the Sturt Light, being built in 1851 at Cape Willoughby on the eastern tip of Kangaroo Island. In addition to vessels navigating the treacherous crossing to and from the mainland, sailing ships (commonly wooden barques) making use of the Roaring Forties trade winds on voyaging to South Australia could be propelled by the prevailing winds into Backstairs Passage, or as far Bass Strait. =Shipwrecks= * San Pareille - brigantine wrecked between Cape Jervis and Lands End on 30 January 1855.Coroneos (1997), p. 57 * Vanquish - schooner wrecked near Fishery Beach in early December 1864.Coroneos (1997), pp. 75-76 * Thistle - schooner wrecked near Cape Jervis in 1866. * Hopper Barge No.3 - hopper barge sunk at Lands End on 21 October 1880 during the operation to refloat the stranded SS Sorata.Coroneos (1997), pp. 80-82 * Ferret - fishing cutter wrecked at Waitpinga Beach in December 1932.Coroneos (1997), pp. 91-92 * Grelka - schooner wrecked near Cape St Alban, Kangaroo Island, on 25 January 1955.Coroneos (1997), pp. 95-96 * Galini - crayboat wrecked near the Pages during November 1981.Coroneos (1997), p. 97 * Olive Florence - wooden sailing vessel started to leak and foundered in heavy seas, between Cape Jervis and Emu Bay, 30 May 1994.  2005 Sea Kayaking Tragedy  On 30 July 2005, two inexperienced sea kayakers drowned in Backstairs Passage.

Initially owned by SES Americom, AMC-14 was designed to be placed in geostationary orbit, following launch on a Proton rocket. Built by Lockheed Martin and based on the A2100 satellite bus, AMC-14 was to have been located at 61.5° west longitude for DISH Network service. It was launched atop a Proton-M/Briz-M rocket at 23:18:55 GMT on 14 March 2008, from LC-200/39 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The satellite was placed in an unusable orbit, following a malfunction of the Briz-M upper stage. Over a six-month period, it was maneuvered into a geosynchronous orbit, and is now near 35° East and in an inclined orbit.http://heavens- above.com/orbitdisplay.asp?satid=32708  Description  AMC-14 is based on the A2100AX platform, and includes 32 Ku-band transponders to provide 24 MHz of bandwidth each. The spacecraft antenna were originally designed to operate over either of two orbital arcs: 61.5°W to 77°W or 110°W to 148°W. AMC-14 carries an active phased array demonstration payload that allows coverage to be reshaped on orbit.  Launch anomaly  An anomaly occurred during the second burn of the Briz-M upper stage. As a result, the satellite failed to reach the planned orbit. The Russian commission investigating the anomaly determined the cause to be a rupture of the gas duct between the gas generator and the propellant pump turbine in the Briz M main engine, which caused the upper stage engine to shut down two minutes early. AMC-14 was the 36th A2100 spacecraft and was expected to provide more than 15 years of service life. SES and Lockheed Martin explored ways to attempt to bring the functioning satellite into its correct orbital position, and subsequently began attempting to move the satellite into geosynchronous orbit by means of a lunar flyby (as done a decade earlier with HGS-1). In April 2008, it was announced that this had been abandoned after discovery that Boeing held a patent on the trajectory that would be required. At the time, a lawsuit was ongoing between SES and Boeing, and Boeing refused to allow the trajectory to be used unless SES dropped its case. Another company had expressed interest in purchasing the satellite; however. SES began procedures to expedite the satellite's immediate de-orbit. While it is expected that the patent would not stand up to legal challenge, SES intend to de-orbit the spacecraft in order to collect the insurance payout. If this attempt had been successful, the extra use of fuel needed to correct the orbital error would have significantly reduced AMC-14's originally expected service life of 15 years to just four.  Satellite's fate  SES Americom told its insurers that the AMC-14 was a total loss because it was in the wrong orbit and could not be moved into correct orbit, according to Thomson Financial. The satellite was fully insured for about $150 million, so SES would not incur a loss. Officials stated that they had evaluated several options for recovering the marooned satellite. Saving AMC 14 would have used much of the satellite's operational maneuvering propellant, significantly reducing its useful life from the 15-year expectation before launch. On 23 April 2008, it was reported that SES was in talks with a United States Department of Defense agency, presumably the National Reconnaissance Office (the agency that operates satellites for the DoD), over purchasing the satellite. It was understood that several other bids, including one from Echostar, have been received. Most of the commercial companies were intending to use the Lunar flyby trajectory option to correct the orbital inclination of the satellite, while the US DoD planned to leave the satellite in an inclined orbit. It was understood that SES preferred the DoD bid, as they did not want a customer to prove to insurers that the lunar flyby option would have resulted in a commercially viable service life. There were some concerns over the legality of a purchase by the US Government, under the 1998 Commercial Space Act.H.R. 1702, The Commercial Space Act of 1997, Congressional Budget Office In anticipation of the US Government's offer being viewed as illegal, an independent European/Asian investment group made a counteroffer to the insurers that called for a minimum upfront cash payment of US$15 million with the intention of returning the satellite to a geosynchronous orbit using the lunar flyby mission and thereafter providing commercial services. Negotiations were slow to start in spite of the alternative $10M purchase proposal from the US Government which was 33% lower than the improved offer from the European/Asian investment group. The first signs of an orbital adjustment maneuver became evident one day after SES announced it was in sales negotiations on 24 April 2008, when the satellite's perigee rose by about to along with a slight rise in apogee to 35572 km. Also, for comparison, at the time Inclination was 48.989, Eccentricity was 0.708, and it had an orbital time of 638.12 min. As of 6 August, AMC-14 orbit is vastly different. Figures for perigee (periapsis), apogee (apoapsis) and Inclination are given in the info box at the beginning of this article, Inclination has dropped to 17.7 and Eccentricity has decreased to 0.199. As of January 29, 2009, after more than 6 months of low-thrust maneuvering, AMC-14 had finally reached an inclined (13.1°) geosynchronous orbit at 34.8°East under US DoD ownership.Gunter's Space Page AMC-14 See also *PAS-22  References  ;Notes  Communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit Partial satellite launch failures Spacecraft launched in 2008 SES satellites Satellites using the A2100 bus ","title":"AMC-14"},{"id":"16050270","text":"Émile Bongiorni (19 March 1921 – 4 May 1949) was a French association football striker of Italian descent.

Map of the Malheur Reservation drawn by the U.S. General Land Office The Malheur Indian Reservation was an Indian reservation established for the Northern Paiute in eastern Oregon and northern Nevada from 1872 to 1879. The federal government \\"discontinued\\" the reservation after the Bannock War of 1878, under pressure from European- American settlers who wanted the land, a negative recommendation against continuing it by its agent William V. Rinehart, the internment of more than 500 Paiute on the Yakama Indian Reservation, and reluctance of the Bannock and Paiute to return to the lands after the war. Establishment On September 12, 1872, a presidential order by Ulysses S. Grant set aside the Malheur Indian Reservation in Eastern Oregon for the Northern Paiute. It was intended for \\"all the roving and straggling bands in Eastern and Southeastern Oregon, which can be induced to settle there.\\" The goal was to reduce conflict between the Paiute, who were struggling to find enough food for survival, and the settlers, whose farms and ranches encroached on their territory. About 800 Northern Paiute were living in settlements and at Forts Harney and Klamath in Southern Oregon, Fort Bidwell in northeastern California, and Fort McDermitt in northern Nevada.Brimlow, George Francis. Harney County and Its Range Land, Portland, Oregon: Binfords & Mort, 1951, pp. 90-1. Three bands went to the reservation, led by chiefs Weahwewa, Watta-belly, and Egan.Gae Whitney Canfield, Sarah Winnemucca of the Northern Paiutes, University of Oklahoma Press, 1988, p. 94 In 1875, Old Winnemucca of the Paiute, his daughter Sarah and son Natchez Winnemucca went to Malheur Indian Reservation.Canfield (1988), Sarah Winnemucca, p. 92 In 1865 they had lost 29 of 30 people in a band in a raid by Nevada Volunteer cavalry, including the chief's two wives, one of whom was the mother of Sarah and Natchez.Canfield (1988), Sarah Winnemucca, pp. 44-45 The reservation covered roughly the drainage basin of the South, Middle and North forks of the Malheur River. It comprised approximately or . At that time, salmon still migrated up the Columbia and the Snake rivers into the North Fork from the Pacific Ocean. Reductions and incursions Almost immediately, European American settlers began requesting changes to the boundaries of the reservation in order to take over more land. In 1876, settlers asked for the exclusion of the Silvies River Valley and the Harney Lake Basin on the southwest edge of the reservation. In January of that year, President Grant, under pressure from settlers, ordered the northern shores of Malheur Lake open for settlement. This was a blow to the Paiute, because that was an area where the tribe collected wada (Suaeda calceoliformis) seeds, which they gathered as food.Treaties and Reservations Created., Paiute History , Burns Paiute Tribe, Burns, Oregon. Retrieved January 31, 2016. (The Paiute around Malheur Lake were known as the Wadatika: the \\"wada-seed-eaters\\".Census of Indians in Eastern Oregon, 1865., The Oregon Historical Project, January 31, 2016) Settlers along Willow Creek Valley on the eastern edge of the reservation also protested the boundaries. The reservation straddled trails between then northern Grant County, where Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce had received orders to move with his people to Idaho, and southern Grant County. With the completion of major portions of the transcontinental railroad in 1868, cattle ranchers in the former Nez Perce lands had begun to drive herds along those trails to Central Pacific railheads such as Winnemucca, Nevada, for shipment to the East. In the high desert country of Eastern Oregon, the ranchers considered the streams and pastures along those trails as highly valuable for sustaining the cattle on the drives.Brimlow (1951), Harney County, pp. 81-130 passim. But, the cattle consumed water and were pastured in lands that were reserved for the Paiute. Bannock War (1878) The outbreak of the Bannock War in May 1878 in Idaho led the Paiute to abandon the Malheur Indian Reservation and take refuge on Steens Mountain to the south of the Harney Basin. The mountain is a large block-fault formation, and its eastern escarpment rises almost straight up from the Alvord Desert, making it relatively easy to defend. They were later joined there during the summer by the Bannock coming west from Idaho. When U. S. Army units under the command of General Oliver O. Howard began moving toward their positions, the united Paiute and Bannock decided to move into the Blue Mountains to the north of the Harney Basin. They raided isolated ranches as they fled northward, killing some settlers, and taking horses and cattle.

In engagements with the Army, both Paiute and soldiers were killed, but casualties were few, given that hundreds of soldiers were operating on each side.\\"Bannock War\\" (mistakenly titled Rogue River War on the page), Global Security. Near the Umatilla Agency on the Columbia River, the Umatilla saw that the Paiute and Bannock were not going to prevail against the U.S. Army, which outnumbered the Native Americans. The Umatilla allied with the Army. Under the guise of negotiation, some warriors entered an encampment of Paiute and Bannock, where they killed Egan, one of the principal Paiute war leaders, and a number of his followers.\\"Native American History: The Bannock War\\". After that point, having lost their leader, scattered bands of Paiute took refuge in the mountains, and many of the Bannock tried to return to Idaho. Ultimately, most Paiute surrendered. Together with Bannock prisoners, they were initially interned at the Malheur Indian Reservation. Removal and discontinuation In November 1878, General Howard received orders to move about 543 Paiute and Bannock prisoners from the Malheur Indian Reservation to the Yakama Indian Reservation, in Washington Territory, to the north. Other Paiute and Bannock were scattered about Eastern Oregon, northeastern California and northern Nevada, working for settlers or engaged in subsistence hunting and gathering. More than a year after the war, most had not moved back onto the reservation, although the U.S. government had urged them to do so. Still others were interned at Vancouver Barracks in Washington. Ranchers and settlers had started to graze their herds on the best meadowlands of the Malheur Indian Reservation, and the U.S. Army had been reluctant to remove the trespassers. In his annual report in August 1879, Agent W. V. Rinehart, who had fought in the West under General Crook and held negative views of the Natives, opined that the reservation should be discontinued, in part because the support for all agencies in Oregon was spread too thin to be effective. In October of that year, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs discontinued the agency.\\"Settling Up the Country: Social Costs of the Cattlemen's Era\\", The Oregon History Project Burns Paiute Indian Reservation Today a small group of Paiute lives on a small allotment of , called the Burns Paiute Indian Reservation (or the Burns Paiute Colony) along the Silvies River, just north of Burns, Oregon.\\"The Fight to Regain the Land\\", Tribal History, Burns Paiute Official Website.

The suburb is named after the Mākara Stream (mā is Māori for white, kara is a kind of greywacke stone). The Wellington City Council regards the nearby Mākara Beach as a separate suburb. With winding road access from Karori or Ohariu, Mākara is a rural area with sparse development. It has attracted people who want rural living near Wellington.  History  In the nineteenth century there was a small amount of gold-mining at Terawhiti Station but no large-scale workable deposits were ever found. Tunnels associated with mining activity still exist on the hillside. In 1921 the Makara War Memorial was unveiled, built in memory of local residents who died in World War 1, and another name was added after World War II. There are gun emplacements at Fort Opau which still remain. These were built as part of the coastal fortifications of New Zealand due to fears of invasion during the second world war. A small foreshore reserve of sand dunes was bulldozed during this time as it was felt these could be hiding places for an invading army. This destroyed ecosystem is slowly being restored by local community groups. The Cook Strait Cable comes ashore from the South Island at Oteranga Bay in the suburb of Mākara. The HVDC line came into operation in April 1965 and was at the time the world's largest submarine cable. A radio receiving station was set up in 1944 in the region, at Quartz Hill, to receive overseas shortwave broadcasts for re-transmission by the New Zealand Broadcasting Service, close to the NZ Post Office Makara Radio receiving station. Subsequently from 1997 to 2007 the site was leased to a local amateur radio club, who installed equipment and multiple antennae to contact operators all over the world. West Wind, a proposal for a $380-million wind farm by Meridian Energy was approved by Wellington City Council in 2005. Opponents claimed that the project was too close to a populated area. In 2007 construction began on West Wind along Terawhiti Ridge. A temporary wharf was constructed in Oteranga Bay to move turbine parts into the area without going through Wellington's Central Business District. The 62 turbine farm was completed in 2009 and includes a recreation area. The turbines are 111 metres high and cover a 56 square-kilometre area including Quartz Hill and Terawhiti Station. In 2019, the name of the locality was officially gazetted as Mākara.  Facilities  = Parks and reserves = There is also a two-hour walk from Mākara to Boom Rock if the Mākara Stream is crossed. There is a small boat access at the north end of Mākara Beach into the river. = Churches and cemeteries = Mākara Cemetery is Wellington's largest cemetery. It was founded after Karori Cemetery edged towards full capacity in 1940, the first burial occurred in 1965. It is currently about one third full. The burial ground Ngā Iwi o Te Motu Urupā is open for Māori and their whānau in Mākara Cemetery. St Patricks Church was built in Mākara in 1873 by the Catholic Diocese. It is now a non-denominational, community owned church and often serves as a function area alongside the Makara Hall next door. Education Makara Model School, a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, is located in Mākara. It has a roll of as of . The school is a community emergency hub.

The ship spent the bulk of her career operating the North Sea, where she twice unsuccessfully attacked the German Zeppelin base at Tondern and conducted anti-Zeppelin patrols. One of her Bristol Scout aircraft made the first take-off from an aircraft carrier in late 1915. Another made the first interception of an airship by a carrier- based aircraft on 2 August 1916, when it unsuccessfully attacked the Zeppelin LZ 53 (L 17).

Initially she carried two dismantled single-seat aircraft in her small forward hangar and five floatplanes in the hangar aft. Both aircraft in the forward hangar could be reassembled and flown off in about ten minutes.

Local Government New Zealand is the local government association of New Zealand. The Association was formed in 1988 when, confronted with pending local government reform, the Municipal Association and the Counties Association agreed to merge into a single local government association. Two years later, in 1990, the New Zealand Regional Government Association (representing the nation's regional councils) agreed to join. In 1996 the amalgamated association adopted the brand name Local Government New Zealand. Local Government New Zealand is an incorporated society. Membership is voluntary and open to all territorial local authorities (cities and districts) and regional councils. All 78 local authorities are currently members. Policy and strategic direction is set by the National Council, a body elected by local authorities through a series of electoral colleges to ensure it is representative of the different types of councils as well as having representation from both North and South Islands. There are six geographical zones, which elect representatives to the National Council and meet regularly, as well as four sector groups, metropolitan, provincial, rural and regional, which also elect members to the National Council and meet regularly to discuss and provide feedback on policy issues. The National Council consists of 15 mayors, senior councillors and regional council chairs, including a directly elected president. Members serve a term of three years and elections are held immediately after the triennial local authority elections. It conducts its policy work through a number of established committees; an economic development committee; a community issues committee; an environmental committee and an infrastructure and transport committee. It also receives advice from a Māori Advisory Committee, Te Maruata (consisting of Māori elected members) and the Community Board Executive Committee (representing community boards, sub-municipal elected bodies found in just over half the cities and districts). The National Council employs a chief executive who operates a secretariat which advises the National Council; prepares submissions on relevant legislation and regulations; promotes good practice; leads strategic communication and provides a professional development program for elected members. Funding is primarily drawn from annual subscriptions. Local Government New Zealand has a single office located in the capital, Wellington. Its primary objective is to represent and advocate for the interests of local authorities in New Zealand. To be effective, the organisation must build meaningful relationships with the government of the day. Since the beginning of 2010, regular Central Government Local Government Forums have been held. These are half day meetings between the National Council of Local Government New Zealand and relevant members of Cabinet. Scheduled for a half day once a year, the fora are jointly chaired by the Prime Minister and the president of Local Government New Zealand. Agendas tend to deal with current issues of joint concern and future directions, and are designed to encourage dialogue between the two sectors. . In its policy work the key messages promoted by Local Government New Zealand are: *Local autonomy: councils should have sufficient autonomy to respond to community needs and preferences. *Local difference: One size does not fit all. New Zealand is a diverse country with differing local and regional needs, priorities and values, consequently as many decisions as efficiently possible should be made at the sub-national level. *Local regulations: more recognition needs to be given by governments to the cumulative impacts of regulation, especially the fiscal cost of implementation on councils and their citizens. This can be achieved by involving local government more directly when regulations are in the development phase. *Local funding: the current range of funding options for local government is too restricted and councils need additional funding tools. *Local infrastructure: local government's role as the provider of local and regional infrastructure needs to be given greater recognition and acknowledgement when national infrastructural planning is undertaken. *Local democracy: local government provides citizens and groups of citizens with choices over the ways their different needs are met and is accountable to these citizens through open and transparent processes. *Local partnerships: local government has the potential to break down government silos and facilitate a more seamless, place based and whole of government response to pressing local and regional issues.

It makes up the Wagait Shire local government area. The population was 461 in 2016. Wagait Beach is not part of Darwin, but many of its residents use the Mandorah ferry to travel to work in Darwin. Wagait Beach is on the north coast of the Cox Peninsula, which forms the western side of Darwin Harbour. It is part of the Hundred of Bray, as surveyed by George Goyder in 1869-70. \\"Wagait\\" (also spelled \\"Waugite\\") is a local Aboriginal language word meaning beach or salt water country. It also refers to the people from that country: i.e., salt water people. History In 1942, after the Bombing of Darwin, a military base was established at Waugite Point on the north east of the Cox Peninsula, and a huge observation tower was constructed, with a communications bunker underneath it. Waugaite tower was destroyed by Cyclone Tracy in 1974. The precise origin of the name of the community is unclear, but the beach adjacent to Wagait Point is called Wagait Beach. One source claims that the community was named after the tower, which is unconvincing as the tower was named after Waugite (Wagait) Point and so clearly is not the origin of the name. Whether or not the beach was known as Wagait beach before the tower was built is not known. The Wagait Community is home to many artists, musicians and writers. Wagait Beach hosts several annual cultural events. At Easter is the annual Wagait Beach Bicycle Carnaval & Mardi Gras. In July is the Mandorah Ukulele Folk Festival. In September is the annual Wagait Arts Festival. Transport Wagait Beach can be accessed by a 15-minute passenger ferry trip, from Cullen Bay (Darwin), to Mandorah which is 5 km from Wagait Beach. There is a bicycle path from Mandorah to Wagait Beach. It is a 128 km drive from Darwin via the Cox Peninsula Rd through Berry Springs. Facilities The Wagait Beach Supermarket, on Wagait Tower Road, is the only shop in the community. The Cox Country Club, on Cox Drive, is the local social club (open Thursday to Sunday). Meals are available from the Cox Country Club. Takeaway food is available from the Wagait Beach Supermarket. The Wagait Shire Council office is on Wagait Tower Road. A sports and recreation ground, operated by the council, is on Forsyth Road. Wagait Beach Bush Retreat offers holiday accommodation. Nearby locations Belyuen is a mainly Aboriginal community located 14 km to the south, via Cox Peninsula Road.

Born in North Carolina, he initially worked as a poet before moving into folk rock songwriting; by 1974, he had moved to Nashville. Initially, he did not plan to become a singer, although he eventually bought a guitar and took up singing as well, as he decided that singing was easier than reciting poetry. The Song \\"Lean on Jesus (Before He Leans on You)\\" co-written by Germino with Rob Stanley and sung by Paul Craft reached No. 55 on the Billboard country chart in 1977. Germino moved on to performing in Nashville clubs at night, while working by day as a truck driver. By 1981, he was signed to a songwriting contract; five years later, RCA Records signed him as a recording artist. Between 1986 and 1991, he recorded two solo albums for the label (1986's London Moon and Barnyard Remedies and 1987's Caught in the Act of Being Ourselves); a third album for the label, 1991's Radartown, featured a backing band called The Sluggers.

Completed in 1879, it cost more to construct than any other room in the building at about $33.50 per square foot (total $55,675.00). The room has been used as a library, but today is primarily used for meetings and receptions. The design of the room includes many nautical motifs, such as shells over the Italian and French marble panels; seahorses and dolphins in the cast iron railings on the second floor balcony; stars for navigation in the ceiling; and the compass in the center of the floor. The floor is the original English Minton tile floor. The room contains the only surviving original lighting fixtures in the building. President Dwight D. Eisenhower held the first televised presidential press conference in the room in January 1955. It was subsequently used for presidential press conferences from 1955 until 1961. On September 12, 2001, the room was used to host the American Red Cross for an emergency blood drive so the White House staff could donate blood in response to the September 11 attacks. In 2001-2002, the room was used for the White House's Coalition Information Center, which coordinated media relations and relief efforts during Operation Enduring Freedom. The name \\"Indian Treaty Room\\" was coined in the 1930s, and it is still not clear where it originated, despite extensive research. One theory is that it arose because the War Department stored papers there during the 1930s, including treaties with the American Indian nations. The Bretton Woods agreements, the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, and Romania after World War II, and the United Nations Charter were all signed in the room.

Ships For ships, the plane guard is positioned at least 500 yards behind the carrier and either to port and clear of the carrier, or at a point intersecting the carrier's final approach line. Ships in the latter position provide an additional point of reference to approaching aircraft. One of the ship's boats is prepared for launch and swung over the side, but not placed in the water. If an aircraft ditches or crashes, either while approaching the carrier to land or following a failed landing, the ship proceeds to the approximate position of the aircraft, and the prepared boat is deployed to rescue the aircrew. The plane guard role is dangerous for ships, as aircraft carriers must often change speed and direction to preserve optimum take-off and landing conditions for their aircraft, and a lack of awareness or any incorrect manoeuvres on the part of either ship can place a plane guard ship under the bows of a carrier travelling at full speed. Both HMAS Voyager (in 1964) and USS Frank E. Evans (in 1969) were lost while incorrectly manoeuvering during plane guard duties which resulted in collisions with the Australian aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne.

After World War II, plane guard duties and search-and-rescue roles were sometimes carried out by amphibious aircraft.

Location It is located in the Marne-la-Vallée University campus and offers seminars with the ENPC (École nationale des ponts et chaussées) which is one of the historically acclaimed engineering schools in France. The school was created in 1998 and designed by architect Bernard Tschumi. It epitomizes all that has to be taken into consideration for architecture students and is made of several materials and theories: steel, concrete, glass. Cantilevers, open space and the \\"box within a box\\". Student body The school accommodates about 500 students. Most of the students are in first year (about 90 to 120 depending on the years), this figure slowly evolves to about 30- 50 students in the final fifth year. Goals The school's goals strongly focuses, as its name suggests, on the city and its context, its territory and environment. Many town-planning classes and theories overlap with the main studio. Studio work is one of the most important features of the school. The school, although very new, is rivaling with other architecture schools that have had a high visibility in quality, knowing that since the May 1968 student riots in France, La Villette and Belleville architecture schools symbolised a very strong separation with the Beaux Arts school, and has since maintained a distinct reputation since. The architecture school of the city and its territories (ASCT) is slowly changing this. It has some of the most influent and important architects that practice in France and abroad as its teachers. Faculty Some teachers had the chance to have been influenced by Ciriani, who was a disciple of Le Corbusier. * Yves Lion, architect, is one of the founders of the school. * Jacques Lucan, architect & renowned French theorist is also a teacher at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland. * Marc Mimram, engineer and architect, studied at Berkeley, California, is a teacher at ASCT and ENPC, respectively. * David Mangin, architect and town planner, has widely published books on the matter.

Plot summary The plot centers on the eponymous hero, Savva Grudtsyn. Savva is the son of Foma Grudstyn-Usov, a merchant from the city of Velikii Ustiug in the northern Vologda region of Russia. As a young man, Savva goes to live in the town of Orel, where he is offered great hospitality by a friend of his father's, Bazhen Vtory. Bazhen is an old, respected, well-to-do merchant who is married to his third wife, a much younger woman who remained unnamed in the story. Savva is seduced by this woman and begins a sexual relationship with her: the narrator makes it clear that the woman and the Devil are primarily to blame rather than Savva himself. However, while attending church on the holy festival of the Ascension, Savva repents and refuses to continue the affair. Bazhen's wife, furious, poisons Savva's wine with a powerful aphrodisiac that causes his lust to return. However, she refuses to submit to him when he approaches him and drives him away from the house. Savva, still desperately lusting for Bazhen's wife, makes a Faustian bargain with the Devil: he realizes he would be willing to serve the Devil in order to sleep with this woman. Sure enough, a demon appears in the guise of a brother figure from Great Utsiug. He informs Savva that he can have his heart's desire if he writes a letter to renounce Christ and God, which Savva promptly does. The extent of Savva's consciousness in writing the letter is unclear: Savva visits a golden city with this demon, a representation of Hell, where he is treated to a lavish meal at the table of Satan and presents his letter to him. They continue their travels to the town of Pavlov Perevoz, where a holy beggar tries in vain to get Savva to repent. He gains the respect of the Tsar and fights against the Poles in the city of Smolensk. The demon tells him he will face and defeat three brave warriors, but the third will injure him; indeed this comes to pass. Shortly afterwards, in Moscow, Savva falls seriously ill while living under the care of a Captain and his wife. His wife calls a priest to get Savva's confession administer the Last Rites, in case he does not survive. He finally confesses to the priest, but a multitude of demons appear and he faces extreme pain and torture when doing so. However, Savva is eventually saved and sees a vision of the Virgin Mary, John the Apostle and Metropolitan Peter of Moscow. He fully recovers physically with the help of the Captain, his wife and the support of the Tsar. He is called by God, and a miracle occurs in church before the Tsar and the Metropolitan: his letter denouncing God becomes a profession of faith to the Virgin Mary and God. Savva renounces his wicked ways, distributes his wealth to the poor and becomes a monk. Historical setting The story is fictional, but is clearly situated in a particular time and space, and does contain references to historical personages: both the Grudtsyn-Usov and Vtory families were well-known merchant families.Zenkovsky, Serge. ‘’Medieval Russia's Epics, Chronicles and Tales’’. (New York: Meridian, 1974) pp. 452-3 The work is set during the Time of Troubles (1598–1613), a period of political instability in Russia as the line of succession to the throne was interrupted, Cossack rebellion occurred, and Russia had to fend off an invasion from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The opening paragraphs of the story refer to Grigorii Otrep'ev, the first of three False Dmitriis, impostors who attempted to claim the Dmitrii Ivanovich, son of the Ivan IV. The story also refers to the Devil takes Savva to fight against the invading Polish armies and he defeats three warriors. Genre and Literary Importance Many critics now consider the tale to represent a transitional period between medieval and modern Russian works of literature. Serge Zenkovsky notes that while hagiographical elements persist in the story of the conversion and the morally didactic conclusion, the fictional plot and vivid realism of the story break with tradition.Zenkovsky, pp. 452 Zenkovsky tentatively considers the work to be part of a Russian Baroque Literature, but this term remains controversial among Russian literary historians and has not been universally accepted.For a discussion of the debates on the 'Russian baroque', see 'Baroque' in Handbook of Russian Literature, ed. Victor Terras (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1985) Marcia Morris argues that the tale straddles the divide between the epic and novel, as set out by the literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin in his essay ‘Epos i roman’.Morris, 1992. She studies narrative voice in the tale and concludes that the opening and closing sections are typical of a medieval, or epic narrator: the moralizing spokesman for universal values; the creator of a closed world. However, the tale becomes more novelistic in the middle sections: time becomes open in the Bakhtinian sense and the narrator loses his omniscience during the middle section when Savva is adventuring with the demon. The tale, along with The Tale of Frol Skobeev has sometimes been compared to the picaresque mode found in Spanish Baroque literature and other elsewhere, insofar as it charts the adventures of a rogue anti-hero.Morris, Marcia A. The Literature of Roguery in Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century Russia. (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 2000) The theme of making a pact with the devil has led some commentators to compare the work to Goethe's Faust.Gonneau, Pierre. \\"Le Faust russe ou L’Histoire de Savva Grudcyn\\", Journal des savants, juillet-décembre 2004, pp. 423-484. Interpretations Morris has argued that the references to Grigorii Otrep'ev (False Dmitrii I) in the opening section are not coincidental and argues that the tale is a re-writing of the story of the False Dmitrii I. She argues that Savva’s sexual licentiousness and defiance of morality and social convention resonate with sixteenth-century writings on Otrep'ev, and points to a number of place names and characters in the tale which corresponds to Dmitrii’s story. She explains the final conversion and redemption of Savva as an attempt to ‘reverse’ or re-write the real story of Otrep’ev. His salvation symbolizes the salvation of the Orthodox Church and Russian state.Morris, 2000. Adaptations A modern re-telling of the Tale was published in 1951 by the émigré Russian writer Aleksei Remizov. Translations An English translation is available in Serge A.

The \\"Illyrian type helmet\\" (or \\"Greco-Illyrian\\" type helmet) is a style of bronze helmet, which in its later variations covered the entire head and neck, and was open-faced in all of its forms.. It originated in Peloponnese, ancient Greece, and was developed during the 8th and 7th centuries BC (700–640 BC)..; . Accurate representations on Corinthian vases are sufficient to indicate that the \\"Illyrian\\" type helmet was developed before 600 BC.. The helmet was misleadingly named as an \\"Illyrian\\" type due to many early finds coming from Illyria.; : \\"Figure D2, based on a Lakonian warrior statuette from Dodona, wears a helmet of the Illyrian type, so-named because many early finds came from Illyria. However, it is now clear that it was also extremely popular in the Peloponnese, which is the most probable area of origin.\\"Naming conventions and typology of ancient helmets are of modern origin and do not reflect contemporaneous usage. ( Archaeology According to archaeological evidence, the \\"Illyrian\\" type helmet evolved from the Kegelhelm (or Kegel type) of the Archaic Period found in Argos. The earliest \\"Illyrian\\" type helmets were developed in a workshop located in the northwestern Peloponnese (possibly Olympia), although the first Type II \\"Illyrian\\" helmets were created in Corinthian workshops. The first Type III helmets were created in workshops situated somewhere on the Illyrian coast of the Adriatic. The \\"Illyrian\\" type helmet did not obstruct the wearer's critical senses of vision though the first two varieties hampered hearing. There were four types of these helmets and all were open faced: *Type I (c. 700–640 BC) left the neck unprotected and hampered hearing. *Type II (c. 600 BC) offered neck protection and again hampered hearing. *Type III (c. 550 BC) offered neck protection and allowed better hearing. *Type IV (c. 500 BC) was similar to Type III but hearing was not impaired at all. The Illyrian type helmet was used by the ancient Greeks, Etruscans, Scythians,. and became popular with the Illyrians who later adopted it.. A variety of the helm had also spread to Italy based on its appearance on ivory reliefs and on a silver bowl at the \\"Bernardini\\" tomb at Praeneste. The helmet became obsolete in most parts of Greece in the early 5th century BC. Its use in Illyria had ended by the 4th century BC..

It is the seat of the administrative district called Gmina Żarnów. It lies approximately south-west of Opoczno and south-east of the regional capital Łódź. Between 1415 and 1876 the village had a status of a town. The village has a population of 870 and belongs to historic province of Lesser Poland. Its name most probably comes from the phrase miejsce żarne - burned-out area, and refers to burning of forests in ancient times, to make fields. Żarnów has a long history, in the early years of Polish state it was a major urban center of the country. The first written mention of the village dates from 1065. It was the site of a major battle during the Swedish invasion of Poland in 1655.  History  Żarnów was founded before 1065, as the first written mention of the village comes from that year, and it had already existed. It was home to one of the oldest Polish castellanies, with a church founded in 1111 by prince Bolesław III Wrymouth as a votum for his victories in a war with Pomeranian tribes. In 1136, a papal bull of Innocent II mentioned Sarnov as one of major grods of Central Poland, together with other administrative centers of the area - Skrzynno and Małogoszcz (the three towns made the so-called Pilica castellanies). In 1191 Żarnów's parish church (most likely founded by Prince Casimir II the Just) was mentioned among seven major churches of the Sandomierz collegiate church. In the 12th century Żarnów was an important urban center of northern Lesser Poland, with its own gord and church. In 1415 Żarnów received a town charter, and despite losing its importance to the nearby town of Opoczno, the title of Castellan of Żarnów remained in use until the Partitions of Poland. In 1795 Żarnów was annexed by the Austrian Empire. In 1815, it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Like many other towns of northern Lesser Poland, Żarnów lost its town privileges in 1876. The Russians reduced it to the status of a village for residents’ participation in the January Uprising.  Points of interest  * St. Nicholas parish church (12th century). Its western wall, with a Romanesque structure, has preserved the original shape. Also, Romanesque are the church round tower and the matroneum. In the Middle Ages, Żarnów's church was located by a busy merchant road from Sandomierz to Greater Poland. The town itself was at that time located to the south and west of the church. In 1510, a Gothic presbytery was added, * remains of the 11th century Slavic gord, located in central part of the village. Żarnów at that time was a fortified settlement, with the castle of the castellan, and a moat surrounding the gord. Currently, the locals call the gord the Swedish Mountain, as here King John II Casimir observed the September 16, 1655 battle between the Poles and the Swedes. On the top of the Swedish Mountain there is a monument with a Polish eagle, erected on May 3, 1923. * central part of the ancient town of Żarnów. The village originally was a defensive gord, located on a hill, with round shape and a diameter of some 50 meters. Most probably, it was the capital of early Western Slavic princes, out of whom the noble family of Odrowaz (see Odrowąż coat of arms) emerged. * wooden bell-tower (early 19th century).

At least 112 Palestinian militants and civilians, along with three Israelis, were killed, and more than 150 Palestinians and seven Israelis were injured. There was some international concern over the scale of the operation, with the United States Department of State encouraging Israel to exercise caution to avoid the loss of innocent life, and the United Nations criticising Israel's \\"disproportionate use of force\\". The European Union demanded an immediate end to Palestinian militant rocket attacks on Israel and also Israel's \\"disproportionate use of force. Background After the Gaza-Egypt border breach by Hamas during an Israeli blockade of Gaza, Shin Bet officials concluded the Palestinian militant groups had smuggled large numbers of longer-ranged missiles, such as Katyushas and Grads into the strip that were capable of reaching Ashkelon, a city six times as large as the rocket-battered town of Sderot. On February 27, 2008, Hamas, the Popular Resistance Committees and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad fired a rocket barrage, in which they fired for the first time six Grad missiles at the industrial city of Ashkelon. While only a few people were lightly injured, the attack had a profound psychological impact. The Israeli Prime Minister and several other minister vowed a tough response. The next day, the IDF started an operation to halt, or at least decrease the rocket fire. Operation According to the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), the operation was aimed at disrupting terrorist infrastructure in the Gaza Strip. One of the targets was Hamas prime minister Ismail Haniyeh's office. Troops from the Givati Brigade, Combat Engineering forces and the Armor Corps are also known to have been involved in the ground operation. The Israeli Air Force was also involved, carrying out airstrikes and providing tactical support for the ground troops. A source in the IDF said that the cooperation between ground and air forces was satisfactory. From February 29 to March 1, Israel mostly carried out airstrikes at ammo warehouses, rocket factories, rocket warehouses and launching cells, combined with small incursions close to the border. Despite the IAF presence in the whole Gaza Strip and the IDF presence in the border areas, the Palestinian militants managed to fire more than 200 rockets during the operation, most of them at Sderot, but at least 20 at Ashkelon and 1 at Netivot. After a day in which 50 rockets were fired, IDF decided to change its strategy on March 2 and sent a whole regiment (about 2,000 men) into northern Gaza Strip to occupy Jabalia and Shuja'iyya but met stiff resistance from the Palestinians. Military deaths totalled 4 Palestinian fighters and 2 Israeli soldiers. Weapons that the IDF reported were found inside a mosque. The weapons included an explosive device that could be activated by phone, coils for an explosive, a mortar bomb, hand grenades, and cartridges. On March 3, 2008 Israel, according to the IDF, was free to search for factories, terrorist infrastructure, Qassam warehouses and rocket launchers in the two towns. In the evening, Israel pulled out its troops from the Gaza Strip, but Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said the operation ended but Israel would soon return to counter the rocket firing and said the airstrikes \\"would continue\\". Casualties As of March 4, 2008, 110 Palestinian fatalities have been reported.Abbas calls for Middle East truce. BBC News. Tuesday, 4 March 2008 While Israel claims that most casualties were militants, Palestinians say more than half of the killed were civilians.Kershner, Isabel. \\"Abbas suspends contacts with Israel,\\" March 2, 2008, International Herald Tribune. March 1 has been noted as \\"the bloodiest day for Palestinians\\" since the Second intifada began in 2000, when almost half the dead were civilians including children. Israeli human rights movement B'Tselem expressed its grave concern at \\"the large number of children and other uninvolved (Palestinian) civilians among those killed and wounded in the Gaza Strip\\". According to B'Tselem, there were 54 civilian casualties. Civilian casualties included children, women and even infants. A 13-year-old Palestinian youth was also killed in the West Bank in the demonstrations staged by West Bank Palestinians in support of Hamas in Gaza. Militant deaths were mostly Hamas members, as well as some Islamic Jihad members, and one member of the PRC. The Associated Press and other news outlets did not report that civilians accounted for the majority of Palestinian casualties, but that they accounted for \\"dozens\\". Israel's attacks in Gaza aired prominently on Arab TV news channels. While expressing regret for civilian casualties, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak blamed \\"Hamas and those firing rockets at Israel,\\" his office said in a statement, pledging to continue the offensive to protect Israeli towns and cities. The Israeli army said it was targeting rocket squads, and blamed militants for operating in populated areas. Associated Press photos showed rockets being launched from densely populated areas in northern Gaza. On 5 March 2008, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's office announced that Israel would maintain its pressure on Hamas. Olmert did leave the door open to an unofficial truce with Hamas. \\"If there is no rocket fire at Israel, there won't be Israeli attacks on Gaza,\\" he told reporters. Israeli government spokesman David Baker said Israel was \\"compelled to continue to take these defensive measures\\" to protect more than 200,000 Israelis living under the threat of Palestinian rocket barrages.Militants \\"hide behind their own civilians, using them as human shields, while actively targeting Israeli population centers,\\" Baker said. \\"They bear the responsibility for the results.\\" Israeli military spokeswoman Maj. Avital Leibovich called Saturday's action a \\"pinpoint operation\\" provoked by the rocket attack on Ashkelon earlier in the week. She blamed the high civilian toll on Hamas' practice of using homes to store and produce projectiles. \\"We are not targeting homes and we have no intentions of targeting uninvolved civilians,\\" she said. \\"We will target launchers and Hamas militants, and bunkers.\\" In Washington, National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe expressed regret for loss of civilian life on both sides but put most of the blame on the Palestinians. \\"There is a clear distinction between terrorist rocket attacks that target civilians and action in self-defense,\\" he said in a statement. One Israeli 8 year-old had his leg amputated in a rocket attack. One Israeli civilian was killed in a rocket attack in Sderot. Two Israeli soldiers were also killed by Hamas forces during an incursion into the Gaza Strip. Soldiers from the Givati infantry brigade were wounded. A much larger number of civilians have been wounded or treated for shock. The rocket attacks have caused widespread fear and hardship in Israeli border towns and have damaged millions of dollars worth of property, including schools.

His father was Antonio, Marquis of Montebello, whose uncle, Gian Pietro Carafa, ascended the papal throne in 1555 as Pope Paul IV. Biography Alfonso entered the Roman Curia in the household of Gian Pietro Carafa in 1548. His great-uncle continued to show him favour as pope, appointing him as an apostolic protonotary and insisting that the young boy sleep in his own private chambers. In March 1557 he was promoted to the cardinalate and a few weeks later made archbishop of Naples. After the disgrace of his uncles Carlo and Giovanni in January 1559, Alfonso assumed the role of Cardinal Nephew for the last few months of Paul's pontificate. In June 1560 he was arrested on the instructions of the new pope Pius IV and along with his two uncles was imprisoned in the Castel Sant'Angelo on charges of corruption and the theft of papal property. However, receiving considerably more sympathy than his despised uncles, Alfonso was spared the execution that was their fate. In April 1561 he was released and in 1562 returned to his archdiocese. He died of a fever on 29 August 1565 aged only twenty-five years.

Serving as commanding officer of the Tambor class submarine USS TritonTriton at Dictionary of American fighting ships during the Second World War, Lent made the first torpedo attack against the Japanese of the war. Early life Lent was born in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, and graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1925.Willis Lent at the Arlington National Cemetery, retrieved March 2, 2008 On August 15, 1940, he assumed command of Triton (SS-201) as she was commissioned. First patrol Upon the outbreak of World War II, Lieutenant Commander Lent and Triton were assigned to Submarine Division 62. Triton made a training cruise to Midway from August 30 to September 15, then participated in local and fleet operations in the Hawaiian area. On November 19, Lent headed west to conduct a practice war patrol and arrived off Wake Island on November 26. On December 8, he saw columns of smoke rising over the island but assumed it was caused by construction work being done ashore. That night, when he surfaced to charge batteries, he was informed by radio Wake and Pearl Harbor had been bombed and was ordered to stay out of range of Wake's guns. The next morning, Lent observed the Japanese bombing the island. On the night of December 10, he was surfaced, charging batteries, when flashes of light from Wake revealed a destroyer or light cruiser on a parallel course. The submarine was silhouetted against the moon, and the enemy ship turned towards. Lent went deep and began evasive action. When the Japanese ship slowed astern, Lent came to and fired four Mark XIV torpedoes – all his stern tubes, the first American submarine torpedo shots of World War IIBlair, p.105. – on sonar bearings (in keeping with prewar doctrine).Blair, pp.18 & 119. He heard a dull explosion 58 seconds later and believed one torpedo had hit, then went to and cleared the area. (No sinking was recorded, and Lent was not credited with one.) After their initial repulse on December 11, the Japanese returned with two aircraft carriers, Hiryū and Sōryū; thanks in part to the confusion at Pearl Harbor, Lent was not informed,Blair, p.123. and Triton made no attacks on them, so any chance to delay or prevent the invasion was lost, as was a chance (always exceedingly rare) of sinking or damaging a Japanese aircraft carrier. Neither did he make any effort to evacuate the 350 Marines. On December 21, he was ordered to return to Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on December 31. Second patrol Lent, with exec John Hollingsworth,Blair, p.208. was sent by Admiral Withers, COMSUBPAC, to the East China Sea in January 1942,Blair, 1996, p.205. where he met filthy winter weather patrolling between Nagasaki, Shanghai, Dairen, and Korea. Lent made fourteen contacts, firing twelve torpedoes, earning credit for sinking two ships totalling 12,000 tons (reduced to 5982 tons JANAC postwar)Blair, p.907. Withers was praiseful, but nitpicked Lent's \\"squandering\\" torpedoes (as critical as he had been with Joe Grenfell and Dave White before),Blair, p.120. because production from Newport Torpedo Station was running drastically behind use.Blair, p.120-1. He also criticised Lent's failure to follow up attacks and undue caution around Japanese aircraft. This was following prewar doctrine, however.Blair, pp.19 & 57. Third patrol After his return, Lent was transferred to command of the Tambor class submarine Grenadier (SS-210), departing for the East China Sea in April 1942.Blair, pp.224–5. He found a convoy of seven ships, including the \\"magnificent passenger freighter\\" Taiyo Maru (14,500 tons) (built in Germany in 1911 as the Cap Finisterre).Blair, p.226. Lent fired four torpedoes, two for influence, two for contact; the influence feature failed to function, but the other two sank Taiyo Maru, sending over a thousand oil field technicians with her. Lent then went to , where he suffered 36 depth charges over the next four hours, so he did not observe the sinking, and on his return to Pearl Harbor, joined the chorus of complaints about the Mark XIV torpedo and its Mark VI exploder. He was echoed by his division commander, Marmaduke O'Leary; Admiral English, COMSUBPAC (replacing Withers), \\"[s]tubbornly following the policy of his predecessors -and the Gun Club line\\", instead blamed his skippers and crews.Blair, p.227.

In 1916, she was commissioned by the Royal Navy as HMS Manxman and saw action as a seaplane carrier during the First World War, after which she was acquired by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company. On the outbreak of the Second World War she was again requisitioned as a troop ship, until she was commissioned and her name changed to HMS Caduceus. She never returned to Manx waters, and was scrapped in August 1949. Construction and dimensions Manxman was built at the yards of Vickers Sons and Maxim at Barrow-in-Furness and her keel was laid in 1903. She was a steel; triple-screw turbine vessel, which had an original tonnage of 2030 GRT; length 330 feet; beam 43 feet; depth 18 feet. Her engines produced a boiler pressure of 200 psi and generated 10,000 indicated horsepower. This gave Manxman a service speed of 22 knots. She was certificated to carry 2,020 passengers and had a crew complement of 80. Service Midland Railway publicity poster; advertising passage to the Isle of Man via Heysham aboard the Manxman. =Midland Railway= Upon her completion in 1904, Manxman entered service with the Midland Railway on the Heysham to Douglas run. She gave reliable service until she was purchased from the Midland Railway by the Admiralty in January 1915. =First World War: HMS Manxman= Manxman was converted for her wartime role at Chatham Dockyard. The conversion included two aircraft hangars and a flying-off deck. She was commissioned as HMS Manxman on 17 April 1916. Her operating aircraft included Sopwith Baby, Sopwith Pup, Sopwith Camel and Short Type 184. She served with the Grand Fleet until October 1917, and was then transferred to the Eastern Mediterranean.HMS Manxman pictured during her Great War service. Manxman lacked the speed of her fellow seaplane carriers and Viking, and she had lost her place in the entourage of the Grand Fleet because her conversion had made her just too slow. The C-in-C of the Fleet, Admiral Sir David Beatty, wrote a letter from on 11 January 1917, in which he said that the Manxman was unfit for service with the Battle Cruiser Fleet \\"owing to her lack of speed\\" - these last six words were added in Beatty's own handwriting. However, Manxman made one contribution to aviation history. She had introduced the Sopwith Pup single- seat fighter, and this aircraft could take off from her launching platform in only 20 feet in a 20-knot wind. The mathematics were in the fighter's favour; its wing loading was only five pounds per square foot and its power loading 16.4 pounds per horsepower; thus producing a significant power-to-weight ratio. This small machine had a Le Rhone engine of 80 hp, giving it a speed of 112 mph at sea level and 103 mph at 9,000 feet. Flotation bags were used to enable it to land alongside the Manxman, and it was then hoisted aboard. At the war's end she was sent down to East Africa, arriving in Zanzibar on 22 November, before returning to Britain, where she arrived at Plymouth on the same day as the Viking. HMS Manxman was paid off in May 1919, and released from requisition on Christmas Eve of that year. =Isle of Man Steam Packet Company= Passengers disembark from the Manxman at the Pier Head, Liverpool.Of eleven Steam Packet ships either purchased or chartered by the Admiralty during the Great War, only four returned to service with the company after the cessation of hostilities, and consequently, new ships were going to be needed to handle the resumption of peacetime traffic. However, industry as a whole was in a disorganised and seriously run-down state after the challenges of the war years, and new vessels could not possibly be built in time for the tourist influx of 1919. The company compromised, and starting with the purchase of , they set about redressing their wartime losses. Manxman was purchased by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company from the Admiralty in March 1920, and she was the first vessel in the line's history to be so named. She was no stranger to the Isle of Man and it was unnecessary to change her name. Upon her purchase, being the largest steamer in the fleet, Manxman became the Commodore Ship under Captain Cain, a position she retained until the introduction into service of the in 1927.Ships of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company (Fred Henry) p.27 She was converted to an oil burner in 1921, and was the first company ship to use oil fuel. Manxman and her sister , were at first the only two ships sailing in 1926, the year of the General Strike, when the miners' dispute made it nearly impossible for coal-fired ships to operate. Manxman operated to every one of the numerous ports then served by the Steam Packet. Known as a reliable ship, she enjoyed a trouble free life until she once again found herself at war. =Second World War: HMS Caduceus= The Manxman had started the Great War in the colours of the Midland Railway Company, and had been converted to a seaplane carrier. During the Second World War, however, she was requisitioned by the Ministry of War Transport as a personnel ship. Manxman served alongside seven of her Steam Packet sisters during Operation Dynamo. On 29 May, she was one of ten personnel ships which together took off 14,760 troops from the East Pier. She returned to Dunkirk on the morning of 2 June, when the operation was getting near its close, and embarked 177 troops. In all, Manxman evacuated 2,394 men. No sooner had she returned from her final journey to Dunkirk, she was ordered west to Dartmouth, where she had the ironical experience of being fired on by a small guard boat that had obviously not been alerted to her arrival. Within a few hours she was redirected to Southampton, and this was to be the start of the most active phase of Manxmans war. The evacuation of the ports of north- west France was beginning, and Manxmans crew knew the coast well, having spent some months before Dunkirk carrying troops to Le Havre and Cherbourg. Within what seemed a few days she made a succession of trips to the French ports under the command of Captain P. B. Cowley. At Cherbourg she embarked retreating Allied troops as the enemy approached the port, and returned to Southampton, often under air attack. Once back on the South Coast of England she disembarked the men she had brought back, refuelled, and was off again almost at once. It was dangerous and sleepless work well remembered by veterans from the Manxman's officers and crew, among whom were Chief Officer Lyndhurst Callow, and Second Officer A. W. G. Kissack, who later became the company's Marine Superintendent. As the days advanced the shelling came nearer, the raids more frequent, and the Cherbourg harbour area necessarily more congested with survival boats, wrecks and the debris of battle. It was \\"Dunkirk\\" again, but on a smaller scale. Meanwhile the Manxman, with no protective armament of her own, continued to venture in and out of the firing. As conditions became desperate and further Allied evacuation became impossible, the destroyer L.11. was specifically sent at full speed of 36 knots from Portsmouth to help cover the Manxmans escape. Chief Officer Callow, who survived to become Commodore of the Steam Packet Company fleet, vividly recalled how the ship eventually pulled out from Cherbourg: Despite the odds, Manxman escaped, with her crew having been forced to cut her mooring ropes with axes. The Manxman then pulled out, thanks to fire cover from a Royal Navy destroyer, which had turned her forward guns on to the German tank column as it advanced down the quayside. Rommel is even said to have referred to her in his papers, describing her as a \\"cheeky two-funnel steamer\\". When Manxman pulled out for the last time, Rommel's main army was only a few miles away.Isle of Man Times. Saturday, 30.05.1953 Page: 3 The Manxmans main duties were at Cherbourg, but she was also deeply involved at the small port of St Malo, to the east, where she was the last ship to leave the shattered harbour. In October 1941, she was fitted out as an RDF – Radio Direction Finding Vessel – and having been taken over for the second time by the Admiralty, she was commissioned as HMS Caduceus. She was then ordered to her former home port of Douglas, where on Douglas Head there was situated one of the early radar training stations - . From Douglas she spent some time on patrol in the Irish Sea, while naval personnel were initiated into the workings of radio direction finding. Her work was not without its mishaps, and Caduceus was twice damaged when colliding with the Victoria Pier, Douglas, and was sent to Belfast for repairs. Following her repairs, the Admiralty removed her from the station as it was decreed that Douglas Harbour was not suitable for a vessel of her size - a strange finding, bearing in mind that Douglas had for so many years been her home port. Caduceus made passage to the River Clyde and continued her radar training duties, only to be driven ashore near Greenock in a fierce gale in February 1943. She was reconditioned with her own name restored, and Manxman then returned to personnel vessel duties. She acted as a troop carrier and eventually moved to the traffic between Harwich and Tilbury and the Belgian and Dutch ports, bringing over service personnel, civilians and displaced persons. The ship's bell of Manxman exhibited at the House of Manannan, Peel, Isle of Man Disposal Transferred to Ministry of War Transport in 1945, she worked as a troop carrier in the English Channel. Transferred to British Army of the Rhine (B.A.O.R.) military service as \\"Manxman\\", troop carrying on the Harwich-Hook of Holland service. She was never to return home to Manx waters, and after a somewhat punishing but nonetheless adventurous life, she was withdrawn in February 1949, no longer fit for use, and was subsequently laid up at Barrow-in-Furness. Manxman was scrapped in August 1949 at Preston, Lancashire. Trivia Life buoys displaying the name \\"SS Manxman\\" are featured in the 1935 film No Limit, starring George Formby. In the film the main character is sailing to participate in the Isle of Man TT. As Formby's character approaches the Prince's Landing Stage at Liverpool, the ship seen at the berth is not Manxman, but adorned in the Steam Packet's summer livery of white and green – this livery was only ever applied to , and . During a following scene, Formby is required to retrieve the hat of a lady, which he had inadvertently knocked over the ship's side. In his attempt to return the hat, Formby falls into the water and people on board the ship throw life buoys to him with \\"SS Manxman\\" clearly visible.

They were primarily divided by geographic, dialectal, political, and cultural criteria, as well as distinct traditions in mythology and religion. Some groups were of mixed origin, forming a syncretic culture through absorption and assimilation of previous and neighboring populations into the Greek language and customs. Greek word for tribe was Phylē (sing.) and Phylai (pl.), the tribe was further subdivided in Demes (sing. Demos, pl. Demoi) roughly matching to a clan. With the dominion of land passing on from one tribe to the other, cultural exchange through art and trade, and frequent alliances toward common goals, the ethnic character of the different tribes had become primarily political by the dawn of the Hellenistic period. The Roman conquest of Greece, the subsequent division of the Roman Empire into Greek East and Latin West, as well as the advent of Christianity, molded the common ethnic and political Greek identity once and for all to the subjects of the Greek world by the 3rd century AD.

Soon enough, in 1927, The Los Angeles Times praised Dorothy Yost as being Hollywood’s youngest and most successful scenarist.“Scenarist Cites Most Essential Parts of Play.” Los Angeles Times (April 10, 1927) By 1927, Yost joined the writing staff of the Film Booking Offices of America Pictures, the same year she married her husband, Dwight Cummings. Cummings was also part of the writing staff and worked with Yost on Fangs of the Wild in 1928. Her goal In her writing, Yost included a focus on Hollywood’s representation of ethnic and racial minorities as well as regional settings. Her films taught lessons for life and often highlighted moral principles. Yost held onto a conservative point of view on gender relations, in part because of the societal times but also because of her strict upbringing and involvement with the Unity Church. Aside from her screenplays, Dorothy published her novel, Prodigal Lover.Pritchard, Sally. “Contributions of the Yost Family to American Literature.” Unpublished family history, ca. 1958.

Empress Euphemia is credited with the ecclesiastical policies of Justin and she founded a Church of Saint Euphemia, where she was buried following her death, probably in either 523 or 524. Justin was buried by her side in 527. Early life According to the Secret History of Procopius, Lupicina was both a slave and a barbarian. He asserted that she had been the concubine of her owner.Procopius, \\"Secret History\\", Chapter 6.17 The information from the Secret History was published posthumously. The seven volumes of histories that were published in his lifetime were the antithesis of this published work, being most laudatory of the new dynasty. Critics of Procopius (whose secret history reveals a man seriously disillusioned with his rulers) have dismissed his posthumously published work as a severely biased source, being vitriolic and pornographic, but without other sources, critics have been unable to discredit some of the assertions in the publication. Although its motives are suspect and it can not be verified, its titillating nature has kept it as a popular reference. The marriage of Euphemia and Justin is estimated to have occurred during the reign of Anastasius I (reigned 491–518) when Justin had a prosperous career in the Byzantine army. New royal names Originally named Istok, the man who would become Justin I was a Thracian or Illyrian peasant from the Latinophone region of Dardania, which is part of the province of Illyricum. He was born in a hamlet near Bederiana in Naissus (modern Niš, South Serbia). As a teenager, he fled from a barbaric invasion, took refuge in Constantinople, and rose in the ranks of the army of the Eastern Roman Empire. In Justin, the First: An Introduction to the Epoch of Justinian the Great (1950), Alexander Vasiliev theorised that the original name of his wife may indicate a linguistic association in another language, with prostitution. Vasiliev connected the name to the Latin word \\"Lupae\\" (she-wolves).Geoffrey Greatrex, \\"Euphemia, Wife of Justin I\\" While the word in its singular Latin form \\"Lupa\\" could literally mean a female wolf, it also was the epithet or disparaging slur for the lowest class of Roman prostitutes.Judy Grahn, \\"Blood, Bread, and Roses: How Menstruation Created the World\\" (1994), Chapter 9 The derivative Latin word \\"Lupanar\\" was the name of a brothel in Pompeii.W. C. Firebaugh, \\"Terms for Ancient Roman Prostitutes and Brothels\\" Many of these denigrating uses may have origins in derisive comments about the priestesses of a cult of the Etruscan religion that predated the Roman, in which the deity was represented as a she-wolf (similar to Artemis in Greek Mythology), which would imply a quite different derivation and make greater sense of the choice of Euphemia, hence a euphemism, as an alternative name for the empress. The wolf, Lupa, who nursed Romulus and Remus is related to the cult of this wolf-goddess and the matrilineal, Etruscan civilization that preceded the Roman. Acca Larentia is another name for the wolf or the deity represented. Emulation of the cultural hero, the religious martyr Saint Euphemia, may have had a more contemporary association and reason for selection as the royal name for the empress, especially given the religious changes taking place in Constantinople at the time and the apparent interest of the empress in the veneration of the saint. Succession of Justin I By 518, Justin had risen to the position of comes excubitorum (\\"Commander of the Excubitors\\", the imperial bodyguard). On the night hours of 8 July 518 - 9 July 518, Anastasius died and his silentarii summoned Justin and Celer to his deathbed. Celer was the magister officiorum and commander of the palace regiments of the Scholae palatinae. By morning the event had been announced through Constantinople. The high officials, including the recently appointed John of Cappadocia, Patriarch of Constantinople, were summoned to the Great Palace of Constantinople for the election of the new emperor. Meanwhile, the people were gathered in the Hippodrome of Constantinople and awaited the proclamation of a new emperor.James Allan Evans, \\"Justin I (518–527 A.D.)\\" Anastasius died childless, but had several known relatives. His brother Flavius Paulus had served as Roman consul in 496. A sister-in-law, known as Magna, was mother to Irene and mother-in-law to Olybrius. This Olybrius was the son of Anicia Juliana and Areobindus.Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World (by G.W. Bowersock, Oleg Grabar). Harvard University Press, 1999. Pages 300-301. The daughter of Olybrius and Irene was named Proba. She married Probus and was mother to a younger Juliana. This younger Juliana married another Anastasius and was mother of Areobindus, Placidia, and a younger Proba.Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, vol. 3 Another nephew of Anastasius was Flavius Probus, consul in 502.Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, vol. 2 Caesaria, sister of Anastasius, married Secundinus. They were parents to Hypatius and Pompeius. Anastasius Paulus Probus Moschianus Probus Magnus, Roman Consul in 518 also was a great-nephew of Anastasius. His daughter Juliana later married Marcellus, a brother of Justin II. The extensive family may well have included viable candidates for the throne. Nonetheless, Justin was elected as the new emperor by the council. According to John Malalas, the praepositus sacri cubiculi, Amantius, had intended to elect a comes domesticorum, commander of an elite guard unit of the late Roman Empire, by the name of Theocritus to the throne.Rodolphe Guilland, \\"Eunuchs in the Byzantine Empire\\" His election is described as the result of a combination of commanding the only effective troops within the capital and buying the support of the other officials. Supposedly Amantius had given a substantial sum of money to Justin in order to buy his support, however, Justin used the sum to buy support for himself. Both Amantius and Theocritus were executed nine days after the election. On 1 August 518, Justin sent a letter to Pope Hormisdas where he claimed he was an unwilling participant in his own election. As Justin I, he was proclaimed emperor in the Hippodrome in accordance with tradition. Lupicina became his empress consort under the name Euphemia. The name was probably chosen for reasons of respectability. The original Euphemia was a Christian martyr during the Diocletianic Persecution. She was a local saint of Chalcedon and the Council of Chalcedon (451) had taken place in a cathedral consecrated in her name. An alleged miracle in her grave had supposedly confirmed the decisions taken.\\"The Miracle of Saint Euphemia the All-Praised\\" The selection of this name is suspected to be an early indication of both Justin and Lupicina being fervent Chalcedonian Christians. Anastasius had supported Monophysitism and his succession marked a change in religious policies. Empress Euphemia Although Procopius states in his Secret History that Euphemia was unacquainted with affairs of state and thus unable to take part in government,Procopius, \\"Secret History\\", Chapter 9.47 an official church source which dates to 540, the Chronicle of Edessa, attributes the ecclesiastical policies of Justin to Empress Euphemia. Procopius also claims that both members of the imperial couple attained the throne in the closing years of their lives. Being childless, their heir was Justinian I. He was the nephew and adoptive son of Justin. Procopius implies that Euphemia opposed the marriage of her nephew to Theodora as she was opposed to the supposed vice of her prospective niece-in- law. Procopius clarifies that only following her death was Justinian able to arrange his betrothal and marriage to Theodora. The widowed Justin proceeded to pass a law allowing intermarriage between social classes,M. Meier, Justinian, p. 57. presumably for the sake of his heir. Vasiliev estimated the death of Euphemia to have occurred in 523 or 524. The marriage of Justinian and Theodora has been estimated to 525. She became an equal ruler with her husband and was greatly admired by many. References * Continuité des élites à Byzance durante les siècles obscurs.

She was laid down in Scotland in 1914 as TSS Nairana for the Australian shipping line Huddart Parker, but construction was suspended after the outbreak of the First World War. Following resumption of work, the ship was launched in 1915, and converted to operate wheeled aircraft from her forward flying-off deck, as well as floatplanes that were lowered into the water. She saw service during the war with the Grand Fleet, and in 1918–19 supported the British intervention in the Russian Civil War. Nairana was returned to her former owners in 1921 and refitted in her original planned configuration, and spent the next 27 years ferrying passengers and cargo between Tasmania and Melbourne. She was twice struck by rogue waves in Bass Strait, and nearly capsized on both occasions. Nairana was the only Bass Strait ferry not requisitioned for military service in the Second World War, and so became the sole passenger ship with service to Tasmania during the conflict. She was laid up in 1948, wrecked in a storm three years later and scrapped in situ in 1953–54. Background and description =Original design= In December 1913, negotiations between the Australian shipping line Huddart Parker and the British shipbuilders William Denny and Brothers began for a passenger ship with some cargo capacity to serve in the Australian coastal trade.Lyon, pp. 679–680. The shipping line wanted a vessel that would improve on their earlier ferry Loongana, which had also been built by Denny's.Plowman, p. 53. Huddart Parker decided on a design that could carry of cargo on a draught of and could maintain for 12 hours. The ship was ordered on 22 January 1914, at a cost of £129,830, for delivery in May 1915. She was named Nairana (an Aboriginal Australian name for the \\"golden eagle\\" or \\"eagle of the sun\\"). Nairana was designed to accommodate 280 first- class and 112 second-class passengers, and had a crew of 26 officers, 42 crewmen and 25 stokers. She had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of . Designed to displace Lyon, p. 679. Nairana had tonnages of ,Gardiner & Gray, p. 69. 1,118 long tons DWT, and 3,311 tons Builder's Old Measurement. The ship was launched 21 June 1915 at the Denny shipyard in Dumbarton, Scotland. The launch had been delayed nine months, after the British Government ordered that all construction workers be pulled from non- military vessels after the start of the First World War, and work had been resumed only to make her slipway available for warships. She remained at anchor for the next year and a half. The Royal Navy purchased her on 27 February 1917 for completion as a combined landplane and seaplane carrier. The price of £138,118 included the cost of conversion to her new role. The ship was nearly complete when requisitioned, although her propelling machinery was not yet installed. Consequently, only limited internal modifications, notably the addition of three large workshops, could be made. =Military configuration= HMS Nairana in 1918 HMS Nairana displaced in RN service. She was long overall, had a beam of , and a mean draught of .

Two of these were mounted on the forecastle as low-angle guns, and the other two were mounted on the rear hangar roof as anti-aircraft guns.Friedman 1988, p. 51. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; this gave a maximum range of .Friedman 2011, p. 114 Nairana was fitted with a flying-off deck forward, intended for aircraft with wheeled undercarriages, and a prominent hangar aft. A massive latticework gantry crane protruded aft from the hangar roof and a twin-boom derrick forward were fitted to handle her aircraft. The smaller forward hangar was built under the ship's bridge and the aircraft were raised to the flight deck overhead by a lift, one of the first in the RN. The forward hangar could fit four single-seat fighters and the rear hangar had a capacity of four floatplanes. The ship could lower them into the water while steaming at and recover the floatplanes at . She carried of petrol for her aircraft.Friedman 1988, pp. 51–52, 365. During her service, Nairana carried Beardmore W.B.III, Fairey Campania, Short Type 184, and Sopwith Baby, Pup, and 2F1 Camel aircraft.Davis, pp. 38, 110, 118. Career =Military service= Upon commissioning on 25 August 1917, Nairana was assigned to the Battle Cruiser Force of the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow,Plowman, p. 54. carrying four Short Type 184 floatplanes and four Beardmore W.B.III aircraft. She saw little operational use as she was employed for pilot training and ferrying aircraft to ships equipped with flying-off decks. In 1918, Nairana participated in the North Russia Campaign in support of the British intervention in the Russian Civil War. On 1 August she took part in what was probably the first fully combined air, sea and land military operation in history, when she and her Campania seaplanes joined Allied ground forces and other ships in driving the Bolsheviks out of their fortifications on Modyugski Island at the mouth of the Northern Dvina River.Dobson & Miller, p. 63. Nairana used her own guns on the Bolshevik batteries. She and her aircraft then scouted ahead of the Allied force as it proceeded up the channel to Arkhangelsk. The appearance of one of her Campanias over Arkhangelsk caused the Bolshevik troops there to panic and abandon the city.Dobson & Miller, pp. 63–64. Nairana sustained no damage during the assault. As of October, the ship was carrying five Campanias and two Sopwith Babys, although these last two aircraft were replaced by Sopwith Camels in 1919. By May 1919, Nairana was refitting in Rosyth.Royal Navy Log Books She then ferried a flight of Fairey IIIC floatplanes to North Russia for use by the Royal Air ForceDobson & Miller, p. 228. later in the month. She remained at Murmansk for several weeks before proceeding on to Kem. There the ship was inspected by Rear-Admiral John Green, Rear-Admiral Commanding in the White Sea, on 29 July. At the end of August, Nairana proceeded to Onega where her aircraft observed for the monitor as the latter bombarded the town for several days before returning to Kem. She departed Russia on 8 October and arrived back at Rosyth four days later. Later that month the ship was transferred to Devonport to begin the process of decommissioning from naval service. =Ferry service= The British Government sold Nairana to William Denny and Brothers after her service in Russia to be rebuilt to her original plans, and the ship was handed over to Huddart Parker in January 1921. Nairana arrived in Melbourne in March, after a two-month voyage from Plymouth, and commenced her first Bass Strait crossing on 18 April 1921. She was registered in Melbourne under the British flag and was allocated the United Kingdom official number 143765, and the code letters THPM. Transferred to Tasmanian Steamers in January 1922,Plowman, p. 57. she operated the Bass Strait run from Launceston, Devonport, and Burnie to Melbourne for the next 26 years. She accommodated 250 passengers in first class and 140 in second, and generally cruised at .Plowman, p. 55. She was withdrawn from service for overhaul at Sydney's Cockatoo Island Dockyard in October 1922, and again in September–October 1923.Plowman, pp. 57–59. In January 1925 Nairana was chartered by the Federal Government and crewed by non-union labour, following a strike by shipping workers.Plowman, pp. 60–64. She was taken out of service for a major overhaul at Cockatoo Island from May to October 1927. On the night of 24 January 1928, she was struck by a rogue wave in heavy seas, and almost capsized; one woman, already ill when she boarded in Launceston, died.Plowman, p. 65. alt=Black and white photograph of passenger ship with twin funnels, under steam As well as passengers, Nairana regularly carried cargo, including gold bullion, and live animals such as horses and cattle between Tasmania and the mainland. A Tasmanian devil being transported to Melbourne Zoo in a wooden crate placed in one of the ship's four horse stalls escaped by chewing a hole through its box, and was never seen again.Plowman, p. 67–69. In 1934, her code letters were changed to VJGY. Nairana was withdrawn from service in December 1935 as a result of a ship workers' strike, returning to the Bass Strait run in the new year. As she neared Port Phillip Bay on 12 April 1936, on a clear day with apparently calm seas, she was again struck by a rogue wave and rolled onto her port side before swinging back over to starboard and eventually righting. The impact injured most of her 88 passengers and killed four, including a family of three who disappeared after being swept overboard. Despite this, she proceeded to her berth in the Yarra River, having sustained only minor damage.Plowman, p. 84. After war was declared in September 1939, Nairana began carrying military personnel as well as commercial passengers. Her hull, previously black, was painted grey, and she was fitted with paravanes to defend against mines, a BL (breech-loading) 4-inch Mk VIII anti-submarine gun on the aft promenade deck, and a 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft gun on her deckhouse. She also carried some .303 rifles for shooting at mines.Plowman, pp. 57, 90–91. As a coal burner that emitted tell-tale black smoke visible for miles, Nairana was not considered for war service, the only Bass Strait ferry not to be requisitioned. She thus became the sole commercial passenger vessel to operate between Tasmania and the mainland through the war years, maintaining a heavy schedule. The ship underwent repairs for 13 days at Williamstown, Victoria, after running aground in the Tamar River in 1943.Plowman, pp. 92–93. Nairana had her final overhaul at Cockatoo Island between February and April 1944. By mid-1947, airlines had captured a significant portion of the passenger trade across Bass Strait, and Nairanas schedule was reduced. On 31 December, her captain collapsed and died as he was speaking to two of his officers while the ship was alongside in Burnie; a post-mortem examination attributed the death to heart disease. Nairana made her last crossing from Tasmania to the mainland on 13–14 February 1948, after which she was retired and laid up in Melbourne. Sold for scrap to William Mussell Pty Ltd, Williamstown, Nairana broke her moorings during a gale on 18 February 1951 and was driven ashore off Port Melbourne. Unrecoverable, she was broken up in place in 1953–54.Plowman, p. 95. Legacy Throughout her career as a Bass Strait ferry, Nairana had displayed a commemorative plaque and a photograph from her days as a carrier, presented by the British Admiralty in recognition of her service in the First World War, and especially her part in the fall of Arkhangelsk. After she was retired, the plaque went on display at the Museum of Wellington City & Sea, New Zealand, and the photograph at the Launceston Maritime Museum, Tasmania.

Leading architects criticized the buildings as \\"imported imitation architecture\\" and \\"faceless yard ware\\", while local residents expressed concerns related to the skyscrapers destroying the traditional cityscape.

Horton is an American engineer and founder of a company producing sensor technology and sensor-based systems. Biography Mike Horton was born October 23, 1973 in Austin, Texas, the second of two children of Claude Wendell Horton, Jr. and Elisabeth Alice Becker. Horton earned a B.S. and an M.S. in electrical engineering from the University of California at Berkeley.  Company Following his graduation, Horton co-founded Crossbow Technology in 1995 with his advisor A. Richard Newton. In 2003, MIT’s Technology Review magazine named Mike Horton one of the top young innovators under 35. After exploring potential uses of silicon microelectromechanical systems sensor technology and experimenting with early acceleration sensors from the Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Sensor as well as commercial prototypes from Analog Devices, Horton and Newton decided to form a company to design and build products based on MEMS sensor technology. Crossbow Technology was founded in August, 1995. The company's initial vision was to leverage microelectromechanical systems based sensor technology for motion-based input devices which are now popular in video game systems such as the Nintendo Wii. The company refined the technology for application in commercial aerospace, and it became the first company to be approved by the FAA as a TSO (Technical Standard Order) holder FAA for a silicon microelectromechanical systems based attitude and heading reference systems. An AHRS provides a solid-state replacement of unreliable mechanical gyroscopes as primary flight instruments thereby increasing the safety of general aviation aircraft. The company's MEMS-based inertial systems are also used in automated guidance of farm tractors and unmanned aerial vehicle systems. Starting in 2001, Mike Horton worked with UC Berkeley professor's Kristofer S. J. Pister and David Culler to develop and produce commercially available hardware for the Smartdust and TinyOS research community. These hardware platforms became known as \\"motes\\". The company produced several generations of \\"Motes\\" including the Mica2, Micaz, IRIS, iMote2, and TelosB. Applications range from crop monitoring to homeland security. Horton was the company’s CEO from its inception until it was sold to Moog Inc. in 2011. The company’s systems were predominantly used in personal aircraft, construction and farming equipment, military weapons, and video game consoles. He later became the CEO of Yabberz, along with his wife Melissa Horton. He holds over ten patents. Horton’s first two issued patents, 5,615,132 and 5,819,206, describe a motion-based computing system, using accelerometers.

Architecture and history In 1960 there were the first thoughts to centralize the headquarters of Hypobank, which was located to twelve different locations at that time. In 1970, concrete planning for the construction of the hypo-house at the Arabella Park started in cooperation with the architectural firm Betz. The construction preparations began in September 1974 with the excavation. For the low-rise buildings and the pillars of the tower, construction work began in April 1975. In November 1978, the new offices were occupied in the low-rise buildings. The skyscraper was completed in 1981 and opened officially on November 16, 1981. Today it is part of the administrative center of HypoVereinsbank at the Arabella Park. The ensemble also includes two low-rise buildings (North and South) and the later built \\"Hypo-House East\\".The building is located at the Richard-Strauss-Straße, corner Denninger Straße, right on the arterial road \\"Mittlerer Ring\\" (district Bogenhausen, subway station Richard-Strauss-Straße on line U4). It is 113.7 meters (374 feet) high and was designed and planned by architect couple Walther and Bea Betz. The static calculations were very complicated due to the unusual architecture and included 100,000 pages. The builder-owner was \\"Hypo- Bank Verwaltungszentrum GmbH & Co. KG\\", Held & Francke Bauaktiengesellschaft were the general contractor. HVB Tower was the first building in Munich with a height of about 100 meters (328 feet).The complex consists of a tower with 27 floors above ground, four underground floors and two low-rise buildings associated with the tower. The net floor area (NFA) is 100,000 m² (1,076,391 squarefeet) gross floor area of approximately 140,000 m² (1,506,947 squarefeet). As an architectural feature five floors are hanging in the Tower (5th-9th floor), which are suspended from a central support frame. Since 2006, the HVB Tower is a listed building. Until the completion of Uptown Munich in 2004, the 27-storey HVB Tower was Munich's tallest office building. Utilization  HVB Tower is a central administrative building of the HypoVereinsbank with offices, conference area, trading floor, computer center and canteen (about 3,000 workplaces). As part of the renovation, a modern office space concept is introduced (Smart Working) at HVB Tower. In addition, the HVB Tower will be the company's headquarters and domicile of the management board Board of HypoVereinsbank in the future. Energy renovation  Worm's-eye view In March 2011, HypoVereinsbank (UniCredit Bank AG) announced that the HVB Tower will be redeveloped the coming years (until approx. 2015) and so should be converted to a \\"green building\\" according to LEED. Construction works began during the year 2013. Important components of the energy-efficient renovation is the renewal of the entire facade while maintaining the outer listed appearance. In addition, the building will be completely renovated, building fire protection will be adapted for today's standards, and use of geothermal energy and rainwater will be implemented. =Renewal of facade = The existing two-pane insulating glass facade is replaced by a box-window facade with four layers of glass, which is state of the art. Glazed External hard disks (one layer of glass) with defined vents allow air exchange with the outside air by opening the internal three-pane casement windows. The coating of the glass allows optimal use of daylight while minimizing solar heat input. Thus cooling loads in summer and in winter the heating energy demand can be reduced. A computer-controlled sun protection in the box window is responsive to both the changing position of the sun as well as to the individual needs of users, it is integrated into the control of the technical equipment. Waste heat generated by solar radiation is dissipated in the box on the window vents to the outside and relieves the building cooling. =Building technology= HVB Tower and \\"Mae West\\" at dusk The from today's perspective outdated and energy-intensive technical building equipment and building technology will be replaced. New heating and cooling systems increase operational efficiency and improve comfort for building occupants. The new building technology is closely coordinated with the new facade as \\"Climate skin\\". =Updating fire safety concept= The creation of a new fire protection plan provides an optimization of the escape ways and fire extinguishing. Among other things, a staircase-pressure ventilation, and a highly efficient smoke removal is realized in the Tower. =Rainwater usage= By installing a rainwater tanks, water consumption can be reduced. The watering of the plants will be supplied from this reservoir. =Geothermal energy= The installation of a fountain cooling enables the use of groundwater as a source of energy and can be realized through the heat exchange principle to reduce the energy consumption for cooling in summer and heating in winter. The redevelopment of the northern low-rise building will be undertaken from 2016.

Composed of both live and studio recordings, it was released on September 13, 2000 by Toshiba EMI / Virgin Music. The RIAJ certified Ze-Chyou Syuu as a gold certified album for 200,000 copies shipped. Background After releasing her debut album Muzai Moratorium in February 1999, she toured the album on her six-date Senkō Ecstasy tour in April 1999, with her band Gyakutai Glykogen. After finishing the tour, Sheena recorded her second album Shōso Strip. After the recording sessions were finished, Sheena embarked on the four date Manabiya Ecstasy tour performed with Tensai Präparat in November, in which Sheena toured university campuses: Tokai University's Shonan Capus in Hiratsuka, Kanagawa, Showa Women's University in Tokyo, Seinan Gakuin University in Fukuoka and Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto. After the singles \\"Honnō\\" (1999), \\"Gips\\" (2000) and \\"Tsumi to Batsu\\" (2000), Sheena released Shōso Strip on March 31, 2000. It was a great success, being certified for two million copies shipped to stores by the RIAJ. From April to June, Sheena embarked on her 16 date third national tour, Gekokujō Xstasy, starting in Utsunomiya, Tochigi and finishing in Morioka, Iwate. In June and July, Sheena quickly toured again, with a band called Hatsuiku Status. The band performed secret lives and they were not widely publicised. \\"So Cold,\\" \\"Mellow\\" and \\"Fukō Jiman\\" were first performed at November 2, 1999 at Tokai University's Shonan Campus. \\"Yattsuke Shigoto\\" and \\"Gamble\\" were first performed on April 17, 2000 on the first date of the Gekokujō Xstasy tour. \\"Onaji Yoru,\\" a song originally appearing on Muzai Moratorium (1999), was first performed on April 1, 1999, on the first date of her Senkō Ecstasy tour in Fukuoka. The Hatsuiku Status songs were all brand new, and had not been performed before their June and July 2000 tour.  Concept  A promotional poster for Ze-Chyou Syuu, showing Sheena with a headache and the medicine concept. The box set was created to look like a medicine case. As the set was composed of 8cm singles, Sheena thought back to the 1980s, the era of 8cm singles and thought of idol Hiroko Mita, who had appeared on many posters for medical products, acting as if her stomach or head hurt. So for the promotional posters, Sheena stood with her head or stomach in pain, with the Ze-Chyou Syuu case advertised on top, as if it were medicine. The set is composed of three 8cm CDs, each featuring a performance from a different band. Disc 1 features performances by Gyakutai Glykogen from Gekokujō Xstasy. Disc 2 is a collection of studio recordings with Tensai Präparat. Sheena intended for these to be live recordings from their Manabiya Tour, but as the sound quality was not what she wanted, she decided to re-record them. Disc 3 contains three songs from the Hatsuiku Status: Gokiritsu Japon tour. Two of the songs were given mojibake titles in the Ze-Chyou Syuu booklet: \\"Onaji Yoru\\" was written as , and \\"So Cold\\" as .  Promotion  \\"Yattsuke Shigoto\\" from given a music video to promote the release. It was shot on the day of the dress rehearsal of the one-night stand live Zazen Ecstasy performed at Kaho Theater of Iizuka- shi, Fukuoka in 2000. All extras playing spectators in the theater were her fans, and they were chosen from her fans who drew a blank in the lottery of the live ticket. The parody of the news report of the various countries in the world at the beginning is used as the introduction part of the music of different arrangement recorded in her third album Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana (2003). In 2006, \\"Yattsuke Shigoto\\" was covered by Kera and the Synthesizers on their third album Tonari no Onna.

Green Hills is a private members-only country club located on the San Francisco peninsula approximately 20 minutes south of the city. Green Hills was originally known as the Union League Golf and Country Club of San Francisco when it was built in 1929, opening to great fanfare in 1930. The Union League golf course was designed by famed architect Alister MacKenzie, who was responsible for Cypress Point, Augusta National and many others. The golf course was built upon a fertile hilly area that was used as nursery land to grow flowers and vegetables. Flowers grown on the property were used by famed horticulturist John McLaren, to decorate the 1915 Pan Pacific Exhibition, or World's Fair. In 1929, when MacKenzie was shaping the land into what is now Green Hills he said “When the Millbrae course is completed it will rank with the first three in the San Francisco district and will be one of the sportiest in the entire state.

It is located on the Ararat plain. Archaeology A neolithic-chalcolithic tell is located south of the town. The first occupation phase at Aratashen was preceramic, going back to 6500 BCE. Parallels are found in the southeastern Trans-Caucasia, and in the northeastern Mesopotamia, especially based on the construction techniques and the lithic and bone tools. Also the pottery, after it appears, is somewhat similar. The best parallels are with Kul Tepe of Nakhichevan to the south, and with the northern Near East, such as the lower levels of Hajji Firuz Tepe, at Dalma Tepe, and at Tilki Tepe. The Shulaveri-Shomutepe culture, that developed in the neighbouring Kura basin and the Karabakh steppe, does not have close parallels with the early Aratashen artifacts.Ruben BADALYAN, Pierre LOMBARD, THE NEOLITHIC AND CHALCOLITHIC PHASES IN THE ARARAT PLAIN (ARMENIA): THE VIEW FROM ARATASHEN (PDF file) 2004 First pottery appears at the end of the fifth millennium BC.

It is also special in its references of localities in Crete and the central Greek mainland. Nikon himself was special in that he was represented as a missionary monk, one who was constantly preaching rather than constantly praying.. Biography Nikon, of Greek origin, was born in Pontus (modern north-eastern Turkey) or in Argos.: \\"...Nikon, surnamed Metanoeite, or 'Repent ye', a man of Armenian origin, born at Argos...\\" When he was young, Nikon went to a monastery known as Khrysopetro (\\"Golden Stone\\") located on the borders of Pontus and Paphlagonia. He spent twelve years there, living an ascetic life of prayer and penance, so extreme that his brothers tried to persuade him to lessen his regimen. His abbot, impressed by his spiritual conferences and worried that his newly returned father would draw him from the ascetic life, sent him out into the world to preach. After his departure, he traveled to Asia Minor and preached repentance there for three years before moving on. Following the expulsion of the Arabs from Crete in 961 by Nikephoros Phokas, he became active as a missionary preacher on the island, struggling to return recent converts of Islam back to Christianity. The area had been a Muslim emirate since the 820s, and in that time Christianity in the area weakened, many former Christians having converted to Islam. Even those who remained faithful to Christianity had somewhat lost contact with the living tradition, churches and monasteries having fallen into decay. The people in the region were, quoted from Nikon's biography, not Islamic, but rather Christians who had been corrupted \\"by time and long fellowship with the Saracens.\\" Nikon was forced to change his tactics on Crete, now having to use his wit to lead his listeners to repentance, rather than just preaching the message of repentance. It was there that he acquired the nickname metanoite (Greek for \\"penitent/repent\\") for his habit of using it as a preface to all his sermons. After spending five years on Crete, Nikon went on to Epidauros, Athens, and Euboea. He then travelled to Thebes and Corinth, and finally down into the Peloponnese, particularly to Sparta, which he reputably saved from a plague. While in Sparta, Nikon constructed three churches and a monastery and continued his preaching and teachings, which were reportedly confirmed by miracles. The Peloponnese is represented as a land full of demons, of which Nikon is constantly struggling against. He ended his life in mainland Greece, in the province of Lakonia, where he exerted considerable influence on both clergy and laity, founding a large number of churches. As a result, after his sanctification by the Greek Orthodox Church, he eventually became patron saint of the town of Sparta and the region of the Mani Peninsula (southern part of Ancient Sparta) where he brought Christianity to Mani and preached it to the Maniots. The Maniots began to convert to Christianity in the 9th century AD, but it wasn't until 200 years later in the 11th century AD that the Maniots had fully accepted Christianity. His feast is celebrated each year on November 26. After thirty or so years of preaching in the Peloponnese, he died in a monastery there on November 26, 998. According to his biography, Nikon continued to grant miracles posthumously, in fact, much of the account deals solely with these posthumous miracles. Nikon is pictured in mosaics in the monastery of Hosios Loukas, or Saint Luke. Legacy As a result of his actions, after his sanctification by the Orthodox Church he became the patron saint of the city of Sparta. His holiday is celebrated there annually on 26 November.

The 38-storey tower is the tallest skyscraper in the city. The building's glass facade wraps the structure of the building like a tensioned membrane. Circular ventilation elements in the form of individually opening windows enable natural ventilation and provide a reference to the outside world by making the background noise noticeable even on the upper floors. The tower with is flanked by four seven-storey buildings (approximately each) referred to as \\"campus\\" which are connected by a transparent roof. A fifth building houses 139 apartments. With its simple rectangular shape, the tower was perceived by some as anti-aesthetic. In particular, it provoked criticism that it interfered with the historic vista from Nymphenburg Palace. Uptown Munich was probably one of the main triggers for the efforts of the initiative \\"Our Munich\\" initiated by ex-mayor Georg Kronawitter, which culminated in a citizens' vote on November 21, 2004 preventing the construction of other buildings of this height in Munich. It was planned by the architects Ingenhoven, Overdiek (Düsseldorf) and built from 2001 to 2004. The cuboid structure has been much disputed. In November 2004, a referendum in Munich was held to decide whether the construction of high-rise buildings in the inner city should be prohibited; as a result, several building projects had to be changed substantially or given up completely. However, , due to the very close result of the referendum and because the referendum's result was binding only for one year, there is an ongoing discussion in the city council on how to proceed with future building plans. In August 2006, the skyscraper and one of the campus buildings was bought by the Government of Singapore for more than €300 million. In 2017 the building was sold to Europa Capital and Bayern Projekt.Europa Capital and Bayern Projekt buy Telefonicas Muich HQ, on www.property-magazine.deMunich: Telefonica-Zentrale sold, on www.immobilienmanager.de Tenants Telefónica Europe (O2) is the building's anchor tenant.

Lichk (, formerly known as Gyol) is a major village located south of Lake Sevan in the Gegharkunik Province of Armenia.

There are also the ruins of the early Tsaghkavank (meaning \\"Flowering Monastery\\") which sit adjacent to the church of S. Astvatsatsin at the hilltop cemetery. Tsaghkavank overlooks the village of Lichk, and the remaining lower walls are cylindrical walls with a very small entry. The reasoning behind this is that one would technically be forced to bow in respect upon entering the church. The church of S. Astvatsatsin is a small basilica with some broken khachkars and gravestones embedded into its walls. It is currently in disrepair as the roof has collapsed. Surrounding the two churches is a 13th-century cemetery with numerous interesting khachkars. Nearby is a cyclopean fort. Between 1950–60, an Aramaic inscription was found nearby.  Education  Primary School of Lichk, Sept. 2014 Two public educational facilities currently serve the village. The Primary School was constructed in 1930 and served as the original school for Lichk. For a number of years, it was the only educational center for the village and those surrounding it. The school still provides education to some of the nearby communities and has an enrollment of 110 students. The regional government has recently proposed closing the Primary School due to its state of disrepair. If the government goes through with its plans, students will face a lack of education due to the distance of the other public school, and 25 teachers and 10 staff will become unemployed.Virág Gulyás, \\"Children Fighting for Their Schools: Armenia’s Rural Areas are Left With No Support\\" (August 01, 2014). .

Artesian Well Controversy  Residents attempt to repair damage to the village spring On August 7, 2013 a spring that had supplied mineral water for the village of Lichk (; meaning sour water) was demolished without the consent of the townspeople. The artesian well had been drilled approximately 40 years ago by Soviet engineers, and was used by residents of the village since then. Many had used the naturally carbonated spring daily, as a main source of drinking water or in hopes of curing certain ailments. A contract was secured through the local government by a businessman to construct a bottling plant at the site to produce soft drinks. Construction began in early-August and the dome of the spring, created by minerals in the water, was destroyed. Residents protested the move made by the local government and took back control of their water source. Restoration efforts were soon underway so that residents could once again use the source of water again. On June 12, 2015 the artesian well was uncapped through the efforts of residents in Lichk and is once again open for use.

The Perpetual Union is a feature of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, which established the United States of America as a national entity. Under modern American constitutional law, this concept means that U.S. states are not permitted to overthrow the U.S. Constitution and withdraw from the Union. Historical origins The concept of a Union of the American States originated gradually during the 1770s as the struggle for independence unfolded. In his first inaugural address on March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln stated: A significant step was taken on June 12, 1776, when the Second Continental Congress approved the drafting of the Articles of Confederation, following a similar approval to draft the Declaration of Independence on June 11. The purpose of the former document was not only to define the relationship among the new states but also to stipulate the permanent nature of the new union. Accordingly, Article XIII states that the Union \\"shall be perpetual\\". While the process to ratify the Articles began in 1777, the Union only became a legal entity in 1781 when all states had ratified the agreement. The Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for ratification by the sovereign States on November 15, 1777, which occurred during the period from July 1778 to March 1781. The 13th ratification by Maryland was delayed for several years due to conflict of interest with some other states, including the western land claims of Virginia. After Virginia passed a law on January 2, 1781 relinquishing the claims, the path forward was cleared. On February 2, 1781, the Maryland state legislature in Annapolis passed the Act to ratify and on March 1, 1781 the Maryland delegates to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia formally signed the agreement. Maryland's final ratification of the Articles of Confederation and perpetual Union established the requisite unanimous consent for the legal creation of the United States of America. The concept of a perpetual union appeared earlier in European political thought. In 1532, Francis I of France signed the Treaty of Perpetual Union (fr. Traité d'Union Perpétuelle), which pledged the freedom and privileges of the Duchy of Brittany within the Kingdom of France. In 1713, Charles de Saint-Pierre presented a plan \\"A project for settling an everlasting peace in Europe,\\" where in it is stated in Article 1: By itself the word perpetual appears much earlier in the history of political thought. In January 44 B.C., Denarii coins were struck with the image of Julius Caesar and the Latin inscription \\"Caesar Dic(tator in) Perpetuo\\". Significance From the start the Union has carried with it importance in national affairs. There was a sense of urgency in completing the legal Union during the American Revolutionary War. Maryland's ratification act stated, \\"[I]t hath been said that the common enemy is encouraged by this State not acceding to the Confederation, to hope that the union of the sister states may be dissolved\\"Papers of the Continental Congress, No. 70, folio 453 and No. 9, History of the Confederation The nature of the Union was hotly debated during a period lasting from the 1830s through the American Civil War. During the American Civil War, the U.S. was called \\"the Union\\". Constitutional basis When the United States Constitution replaced the Articles, nothing in it expressly stated that the Union is perpetual. Even after the Civil War, which had been fought by the U.S. to prevent eleven of the southern slave states from leaving the Union, some still questioned whether any such inviolability survived after the U.S. Constitution replaced the Articles. This uncertainty also stems from the fact that the Constitution, technically an amendment of the perpetual Articles, was not ratified unanimously before going into effect, as required by the Articles (two states, North Carolina and Rhode Island, had not ratified when George Washington was sworn in as the first U.S. President). The United States Supreme Court ruled on the issue in the 1869 Texas v. White case. In that case, the court ruled that the drafters intended the perpetuity of the Union to survive: During the ratification of the Constitution, ratifications by New York, Virginia and Rhode Island included language that reserved the right of those states to exit the U.S. federal system if they felt \\"harmed\\" by the arrangement. In Virginia's ratification the reservation is stated thus; \\"...the People of Virginia declare and make known that the powers granted under the Constitution being derived from the People of the United States may be resumed by them whensoever the same shall be perverted to their injury or oppression ...\\" However, in a 1788 letter to Alexander Hamilton, James Madison disapproved of the language, and stated in regards to it that: Hamilton and John Jay agreed with Madison's view, reserving \\"a right to withdraw [was] inconsistent with the Constitution, and was no ratification.\\" Also located here. The New York convention ultimately ratified the Constitution without including the \\"right to withdraw\\" language proposed by the anti-federalists. Gouverneur Morris, often called the \\"Penman of the Constitution,\\" by contrast argued during the War of 1812 that States could secede under certain conditions.Forrest McDonald, Novus Ordo Seclorum: The Intellectual Origins of the Constitution, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas: 1985, 281. In his first inaugural address, George Washington referred to an \\"indissoluble union\\", and in his farewell address to the country, telling Americans that they should maintain \\"the security of their union and the advancement of their happiness.\\" In his farewell address, Washington stated that the union of states was \\"your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual\\", and in urging Americans to maintain it, stated that \\"you should properly estimate the immense value of your national Union to your collective and individual happiness.\\" Patrick Henry, shortly before his death, urged Americans not to \\"split into factions which must destroy that union upon which our existence hangs.\\" Constitutional scholar Kevin Gutzman took an opposing approach, arguing that in the 1700s many treaties were purported to be \\"perpetual\\", but this did not preclude either side from bringing the agreement to an end thus \\"perpetual\\" only means that there is no built-in sunset provision.Kevin Gutzman, The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Constitution, Regency Publishing, Inc., Washington D.C.: 2007, 12. For example, the Treaty of Paris called for a \\"perpetual peace\\" between Great Britain and the United States,Treaty of Paris (1783), http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/paris.asp but less than three decades later the two nations warred again in the War of 1812.

The artifacts, found preserved in soil under a later lava flow and dated at 325,000 – 335,000 years old, were a mix of two distinct stone tool technology traditions: bifacial tools and Levallois tools. Daniel Adler suggests that the coexistence of bifacial and Levallois tools at the site provides the first clear evidence that local populations developed Levallois technology out of existing bifacial technology and that the artifacts found at Nor Geghi reflect the technological flexibility and variability of a single population. He further concludes that this challenges the view that technological change resulted from population change and suggests instead that Levallois technology developed independently from existing technology within different human populations who shared a common technological ancestry.

It currently plays in Serie D, the fourth tier of the Italian league system. Its colors are orange and black. History The club was founded in 1927 as Unione Sportiva Mestrina. The club made their first Serie C appearance in 1938, winning the league in 1946 and subsequently taking part to the 1946–47 Serie B season, on what it was the highest moment in the club's history. In the following years, Mestrina played mostly around Serie C and Serie D level. In 1980 the club was renamed to Associazione Calcio Mestre, and played in the Serie C1 and Serie C2 leagues on a regular basis. In 1987 the club was acquired by Maurizio Zamparini, who had already bought Venezia, in order to merge the two clubs together under a new denomination of Venezia- Mestre Calcio and a choice of team colours that combined together Mestre's orange and black with Venezia's black and green. In 1989, following the club's change of name to Venezia 1907 (thus excluding any past reference to Mestre altogether) and the club's decision to move out of the Mestre-based Stadio Francesco Baracca in 1991, attempts were made to refound the original Mestre club, with Eccellenza club Malcontenta moving to the Venice suburb and changing its denomination to Malcontenta-Mestrina and finally back to Mestre Calcio. In 1995, Mestre Calcio returned to Serie D, and won a second consecutive promotion the next year, thus bringing Mestre back to professionalism already in 1996. The club were relegated in 2003 and went bankrupt afterwards. The club resumed activity from Terza Categoria and reached Prima Categoria in 2010. A minor club in town, called Mestrina F.C., were playing in Eccellenza at the time; due to a number of legal loopholes, the two clubs merged together in 2015 to acquire the footballing rights of Mogliano-based club Union Pro, who were playing in Serie D at the time. Through all this, Mestre managed to return to Serie D for the 2015–16 season, and won promotion to Serie C in 2017 under head coach Mauro Zironelli. After the 2017–18 Serie C season, Mestre attempted to enroll in the next championship at the last minute. However, anticipated new financial backers walked away from the club, citing concerns over infrastructure. After the Serie C registration was rejected, Mestre had no better option but to play the 2018–19 season in Eccellenza. Mestre were immediately promoted back to Serie D on their first Eccellenza season, winning the national playoff tournament in 2019.

Shnogh is a village in the region of Lori in Armenia at 41°9'0\\" north of the equator and 44°50'24\\" east of the Greenwich Prime Meridian. The population is approximately 3250 (870 families)(1996). Shnogh is a big village. The name comes from Armenian roots with the meaning abundant soil. Shnogh has rich agricultural potential. It is one of the old, known and prosperous settlements in the region. Shnogh has middle and art schools, culture house, library, cinema, kinder garden, hospital, ambulatory, drug-stores, museum of history etc. Shnogh is in the east part of mountain area named Gugarq, at the right site slope of river Debed, in a very complex geographical relief (which makes very beautiful and unusual view of village). The weather is mild, close to dry subtropical, annual mean temperature is 11.1 C, maximum recorded 38C, and minimum recorded 22C. In the surrounded mountains are many different mines such as copper, molybdenum, iron, which were mined in ancient times. The forests are abundant with rich and valuable trees, grass, wild berries and fruits. The agriculture is developed from ancient times.  History  The history of Shnogh is closely related to the fortress named Kaitsoon (10th-11th centuries). The name change Kaitsoon-Shnogh was made in later times (19th century). Shnogh has shared the difficult and dramatic history of Armenia. In the 10th and 11th centuries in this area were under the rule of the Kyurikian princes; in 1118, Kaitsoon was attached to Georgia by David Builder King of Georgia. In 13th-15th centuries, the fortress was under Zakarian princes (Armenian), since the 13th century it was attacked many times by Seljuk-Turks and Mongol-Tatars. Since the 17th century, the Persian King Abas has continually removed the Armenian and Georgian natives from this area and sending there Turk nomads. The area was attacked many times further. In 1919, Lori region was declared as neutral zone to protect area from Turkey. In the end of 1920 to prevent the progress of Turkish army, Georgia sent his armies to Lori and declared army regime in region. After ending the Armenian- Turkish war, however, Georgia claimed the region and did not remove his armies from Lori. In November 1920, the natives with the help of army removed Georgian forces from region and Lori region within Armenia entered Soviet Union. After the independence declaration of Armenia on September 21, 1991, the village entered the new times with many economical problems and continues to recover its welfare.

There is no administrative district in Chiyoda called \\"Hibiya\\". Hibiya is used in some local place names such as Hibiya Park (Hibiyakoen) and Hibiya Station (administratively in Yūrakuchō). Hibiya was part of the old Kōjimachi ward in Tokyo City, before it was transformed into a metropolis. The outskirts of this district are reclaimed from the ocean, so the name of \\"hibi\\" of Hibiya is derived from the facility for the laver of nori made of bamboo whose name is also \\"hibi\\". This effectively makes 日比谷 (Hibiya) an ateji, kanji characters used to phonetically represent native Japanese words. History In the era of Tokugawa shogunate, the Tokugawa bakufu worked out of Edo castle and the area surrounding Edo castle was developed and landfilled and the fishing village became an urban area where many Daimyō live.

He was a Nationalist Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1917 to 1922, representing the electorate of Illawarra. Early life and career Lamond was born at Broughton Creek, near Berry, New South Wales and educated at public schools. He was apprenticed as a printer to the Carcoar Chronicle when he was 14 and was its editor at 25. He was involved in the establishment of the Australian Labor Party between 1895 and 1900. In 1902, he married Gwynetha, the daughter of Australian Workers' Union president, William Spence. From 1905 to 1916, he was editor and manager of the Australian Workers' Union's The Australian Worker. During World War I, he came to be opposed to labor radicalism, and in particular to the Industrial Workers of the World. He became a strong supporter of Billy Hughes, and followed him out of Labor and into the new Nationalist Party in the 1916 Labor split. As a supporter of conscription, he was obliged to resign from the Australian Worker. Lamond made a succession of unsuccessful Labor candidacies between 1896 and 1914, for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Cowra at the 1894 election, 1896 by-election and 1898 election, and at the 1904 election for Goulburn, then for the Australian House of Representatives seat of Lang at the 1913 and 1914 elections. Political career He won the seat of Illawarra as a Nationalist at the 1917 election, and was appointed assistant minister for repatriation in December 1921. The seat of Illawarra was abolished before the 1922 election and he stood unsuccessfully for Barton. Later life In 1923 Lamond bought The Southern Mail and three other rural newspapers, which he edited and published in Bowral. He died at Bowral, survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter.

Biography Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Elliott grew up in a strict Catholic home in the Franklin Town area of the city, along with eleven brothers and sisters, moving to Eastern Kingston when he was ten. His father and older brother played the guitar; with his older brother accompanying Elliott's early singing efforts. Like many of the Jamaican solo singers of the 1970s, Elliott began his career in the 1960s as part of a vocal harmony group, in his case a group he formed in secondary school, The Flames, and in 1966 The Lyrics, who recorded for Coxsone Dodd in the late 1960s, with tracks such as \\"A Get It\\", \\"Girls Like Dirt\\", and \\"Hear What The Old Man Say\\".Campbell, Howard (2012) \\"Black Star Liner - Fred Locks recalls tribute to Garvey\\", Jamaica Observer, 17 August 2012. Retrieved 1 September 2012 They later moved on to Vincent Chin's Randy's setup, recording \\"Give Thanks\\", \\"East to the Right\\", and a cover of Simon & Garfunkel's \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\", also working with Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, and released the self-financed \\"Sing A Long\\" in 1971 on their own Lyric label. Disillusioned by the financial side of the Jamaican music industry, Elliott immersed himself in the Rastafarian faith, living on the beach at Harbour View. Elliott allowed his locks to grow to a great length, giving rise to his nickname of 'Fred Locks'. During his time living on the beach, he continued to write songs, one of which, \\"Black Star Liners\\", written with Owen Goode and referring to Marcus Garvey's shipping line (Black Star Line) intended to transport black Americans to Africa as part of the Back-to-Africa movement, came to the attention of producer and Twelve Tribes member Hugh Boothe. Boothe persuaded Locks to record the song, and it was released in 1975 on the Jahmikmusic label in Jamaica, and on Grounation in the United Kingdom, propelling Locks to cult status. This was followed up by \\"The Last Days\\", which had a lesser impact. Grounation offshoot Vulcan issued the debut album Black Star Liner/True Rastaman in 1976, an album that has remained popular with roots reggae audiences ever since, with the title track regarded as a roots anthem. In the late 1970s, Elliott was also a member of the vocal trio Creation Steppers, along with Eric Griffiths and Willy Stepper, releasing records in Jamaica on their own Star of The East label, and having a hit in Jamaica with \\"Stormy Night\\". In 1980, the trio travelled to the UK for a small tour, and began an association with London-based sound system operator and producer Lloyd Coxsone, who released a number of singles by the group, and also some Fred Locks solo records. These were collected on the album Love and only Love in 1982. In 1982, Locks married an American woman and moved to the United States, recording only sporadically until the mid-1990s, when he recorded an album, Culturally, for Phillip Smart. followed by albums on Philip \\"Fatis\\" Burrell's Xterminator label and on VP.

Moore; 25 June 1905 – 8 March 1960) was a British Theravada Buddhist monk and translator of Pali literature. Biography Born in Cambridge, Osbert was the only child of biologist John Edmund Sharrock Moore and Heloise Moore (née Salvin). He was named after Heloise's father, the naturalist Osbert Salvin. He studied modern languages at Exeter College, Oxford. He helped a friend to run an antiques shop before joining the army at the outbreak of World War II, joining the anti-aircraft regiment before being transferred to the Intelligence Corps officer-cadet training camp. He was posted to a camp on the Isle of Man to help oversee Italian internees. In 1944 he was posted to Italy serving as an intelligence officer interrogating spies and saboteurs. During this period he discovered Buddhism via Julius Evola's The Doctrine of Awakening a Nietzschean interpretation of Buddhism. This work had been translated by his friend Harold Edward Musson, also an intelligence officer serving in Italy. After the war Moore joined the Italian section of the BBC. Moore and Musson, who shared a flat in London, were quite disillusioned with their lives and left to Sri Lanka in 1949 to become Buddhist monks. On 24 April 1949 they received the novice (samanera) ordination or going forth, pabbajjā, from Ñatiloka at the Island Hermitage. In 1950 they received their bhikkhu ordination at Vajirarama Temple Colombo. Ñāṇamoli spent almost his entire monk life of eleven years at the Island Hermitage. After having been taught the basics of Pali by Nyanatiloka Mahathera, Ñāṇamoli acquired a remarkable command of the Pali language and a wide knowledge of the canonical scriptures within a comparatively short time. He is remembered for his reliable translations from the Pali into English, mostly of abstruse texts such as the Nettippakaraṇa which are considered difficult to translate. He also wrote essays on aspects of Buddhism. By 1956 he had translated Visuddhimagga into English and got it published as The Path of Purification. He also compiled The Life of the Buddha, a reliable and popular biography of the Buddha based on authentic records in the Pali Canon. His notes with his philosophical thoughts were compiled by Nyanaponika Thera and published as A Thinker's Note Book. His handwritten draft translation of the Majjhima Nikaya was typed out after his death and edited by Bhikkhu Khantipalo, and partly published as A Treasury of the Buddha's Discourses and then edited again by Bhikkhu Bodhi and published as Middle Length Length Discourse of the Buddha and published by Wisdom Publications in 1995. Other draft translations, edited and published after his death, are The Path of Discrimination (Paṭisambhidāmagga) and Dispeller of Delusion (Sammohavinodanī). While on a pilgrimage he died suddenly due to heart failure at the hamlet of Veheragama near Mahawa. His body was brought to Vajirarama Temple in Colombo and cremated at a nearby cemetery.

The circumstances were described by The Economist as \\"an extraordinary example of the little trouble the public take to think for themselves\\".Economist, 22 June 2013 p. 29 The eight surviving directors—among them Henry Dunning Macleod—were put on trial in February 1858 (the bank's founder, John MacGregor, Member of Parliament for Glasgow, had died in 1857). They were tried for conspiracy to defraud the bank's customers at the Court of Queen's Bench before the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Campbell. On the first day of the trial the Prince of Wales attended and sat on the bench next to the Lord Chief Justice. The jury found each of the defendants guilty of the charges and they were given sentences ranging from a nominal fine of one shilling to imprisonment for up to one year. By July 1858, however, only one of the convicted, the former manager of the bank and arguably the least influential person among the convicted, remained in prison; the contrast with the treatment of the directors in the City of Glasgow Bank collapse is perhaps instructive. The collapse gave rise to a new legislation tightening banking regulation, including the publication of balance sheets and the auditing of accounts.

The estate mainly comprises council housing built in the 1950s and owned or formerly owned by the London Borough of Camden. It stands on land sold in 1951 by the Crown Estate to the Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras, following the destruction of most of the buildings in the area during the London Blitz. New blocks are planned to be built on-site to replace the 182 homes (136 for social rent and 24 privately owned under Right to Buy) that are to be lost with the demolition of the Eskdale, Ainsdale, and Silverdale blocks (possibly followed by the demolition Landale, Coniston, and Cartmel blocks) located on the northwestern edge of the estate next to the railway line as part of the construction of the new London- Birmingham high-speed rail line (known as HS2) and an expanded Euston Station. Camden Council, which consistently objected to the demolition, has produced area plans for regeneration that include a mix of infill development of new tower blocks and creating additional floors on existing buildings, as well as the replacement of local amenities such as a local pub and shops that will be lost to demolition in the area.

Founded in 1946 as a charter member of the Basketball Association of America, the Celtics then moved into the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1949, as said league was formed by the merger of the BAA merged with the National Basketball League. Currently playing in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference, the Celtics have the most NBA titles with 17 championships. Eleven of those occurred between 1957 and 1969, with a dynasty led by center Bill Russell and coach/general manager Red Auerbach. The Celtics won two more titles in the 1970s under coach Tom Heinsohn, and three more in the 1980s under the leadership of forward Larry Bird. After a 22-year drought, the Celtics got their latest title in 2008. 1946–1956: Building the dynasty The 1956–57 team that won the first championship for the franchise. The Celtics were formed in 1946 as a team in the Basketball Association of America, and became part of the National Basketball Association after the merger of the BAA and the National Basketball League to form the NBA in the fall of 1949. In 1950, the Celtics became the first franchise to draft an African American player, signing Chuck Cooper. The Celtics had struggled during their early years, but the hiring of Coach Red Auerbach would change their fortunes. One of the first major players to join the Celtics was Bob Cousy, whom Auerbach initially refused to draft. Cousy eventually became the property of the Chicago Stags. When that franchise went bankrupt, Cousy was acquired by the Celtics in a dispersal draft. He would become a huge part of the Celtics' success and eventually became good friends with his new coach. Under Auerbach the Celtics improved dramatically, becoming a consistent threat to win in the NBA's Eastern Division in each of his first six seasons, although they fell short each time. After the 1955–56 season, Auerbach made a stunning trade. He sent perennial All-Star Ed Macauley to the St. Louis Hawks along with the draft rights to Cliff Hagan in exchange for the Hawks' first round draft pick, the second overall.Official Website of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame – Hall of Famers After negotiating with the Rochester Royals, Auerbach used the pick to select University of San Francisco center Bill Russell. Auerbach also acquired Holy Cross standout, and 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year, Tommy Heinsohn. Russell and Heinsohn worked extraordinarily well with Cousy, and they were the players around whom Auerbach would build the Celtics for more than a decade. Russell, who delayed joining until the middle of the 1957 season in order to play for the U.S. Olympic Team, had an immediate impact. 1957–1969: The dynasty Bill Russell and Red Auerbach won 11 titles with the Celtics; Auerbach was the general manager and coached the first 9 titles, while center Russell served as player-coach in the last two championships. Russell joined the Celtics in December 1956 and went on to play most every game during which the Celtics advanced to the NBA Finals and defeated the St. Louis Hawks in seven games, giving the Celtics the first of their record 17 NBA Championships.NBA.com: Bob Pettit Bio In 1958, the Celtics again advanced to the NBA Finals, this time losing to the Hawks in 6 games. However, with the acquisition of K.C. Jones that year, the Celtics began a dynasty that would last for more than a decade. In 1959, with Cousy at point guard, Russell at center and Heinsohn at forward, the Celtics won the NBA Championship after sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers.LAKERS: Los Angeles Lakers History Still coached by Auerbach, the Celtics won seven more consecutive championships, extending their streak to eight in a row. During that timespan, the Celtics met the Lakers in the Finals six times, starting an intense and often bitter rivalry. In 1964, Auerbach made the Celtics the first team to have an all African American starting lineup. After the 1966 championship, Auerbach retired as coach and Russell took over as player-coach. With his appointment, Russell also became the first African American coach in any sport. Auerbach would remain the general manager, a position he would hold well into the 1980s. However, that year the Celtics' string of NBA titles was broken as they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals. The aging team managed two more championships in 1968 and 1969, defeating the Lakers each time in the NBA Finals. Russell retired after the 1969 season, effectively ending a dominant Celtics dynasty that had garnered 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons. The streak of 8 consecutive NBA championships is the longest streak of consecutive championships in U.S. professional sports history.\\"Unbreakable\\" Sports Records (The World Almanac) Other important players during this era included Sam Jones, John Havlicek, Bill Sharman, Frank Ramsey, and Satch Sanders. 1970–1978: Rebuilding the dynasty The 1970 season was a rebuilding year, as the Celtics had their first losing record since the 1949–50 season, the year prior to Auerbach's arrival. However, with the acquisition of Dave Cowens, Paul Silas, and Jo Jo White, the Celtics soon became dominant again.Bio at BlinkBits After losing in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1972, the Celtics regrouped and came out determined in 1973 and posted an excellent 68–14 regular season record. But the season ended in disappointment, as they were upset in 7 games by the New York Knicks in the Conference Finals and became the team with the best record ever to have failed to make the Finals. The Celtics returned to the playoffs the next year, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA Finals in 1974 for their 12th NBA Championship.Bucks NBA The teams split the first four games, and after the Celtics won Game 5 in Milwaukee they headed back to Boston leading three games to two, with a chance to claim the title on their home court. However, the Bucks won Game 6 when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar nestled in a hook shot with three seconds left in the game's second overtime, and the series returned to Milwaukee. But Cowens was the hero in Game 7, scoring 28 points, as the Celtics brought the title back to Boston for the first time in five years. In 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the Phoenix Suns in 6 games. The Celtics advanced to the 1976 NBA Finals, which featured one of the greatest games in the history of the NBA. With the series tied at two games apiece, the Suns trailed early in the Boston Garden, but came back to force overtime. In double overtime, a Gar Heard turn-around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime, at which point the Celtics prevailed. Tommy Heinsohn coached the team for those two championships. After the 1976 championship and a playoff appearance in 1977, Boston went into another phase of rebuilding. In the 1977 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted a young forward from the UNC Charlotte named Cedric Maxwell. Maxwell did not contribute much in his rookie season, but he showed promise. Auerbach's job became even tougher following a horrible 1977–78 in which they went 32–50 as John Havlicek, the Celtics All-Time leading scorer, retired after 16 seasons. 1979–1992: The Larry Bird era Larry Bird got the Celtics to five finals and three championships in the 1980s. Thanks to a trade and their poor record in 1977–78, the Celtics owned two of the top eight picks in the 1978 NBA draft. Since the Celtics had two draft choices, Auerbach took a risk and selected junior Larry Bird of Indiana State with the 6th pick, knowing that Bird would elect to remain in college for his senior year. The Celtics would retain his rights for one year, a rule that was later changed, and Auerbach believed that Bird's potential would make him worth the wait. Auerbach also felt that when the college season ended the Celtics would have a great chance to sign Bird. Auerbach was right and Bird signed soon after leading Indiana State to the NCAA Championship game, where they fell to a Michigan State University team that was led by Magic Johnson. Prior to the 1978–79 season, the Celtics changed ownership, as Irv Levin was looking to move to his native California, and entered an arrangement with John Y. Brown, Jr., who at the time was the owner of the Buffalo Braves. Brown traded ownership of the Braves for Levin's stake in the Celtics, thus allowing Brown to remain as a team owner and freeing up Levin to make the move he desired to make. Thus, Brown became the new owner of the Celtics while Levin moved the Braves to San Diego, California, where they became known as the San Diego Clippers. As part of the deal, trades were made between the Braves/Clippers franchise and the Celtics franchise which resulted in many former Braves joining the team. One of these trades led to Brown's first of many ongoing disputes with Auerbach, that where franchise center Bob McAdoo joined the Celtics for three first round draft picks that Auerbach had planned on using for the future rebuilding project he was trying to undertake. The dispute nearly led Auerbach to resign as general manager for a position with the New York Knicks. With public support strongly behind Auerbach, Brown elected to sell the team rather than face the wrath of the city for being the man who drove Red to a hated rival. During his short ownership, Brown orchestrated a trade for Bob McAdoo that Auerbach despised, and the team unraveled. The Celtics would struggle through the season, going 29–53 without Bird. Newcomers Chris Ford, Rick Robey, Cedric Maxwell and Tiny Archibald failed to reverse the team's momentum. Bird would debut for the Celtics during the 1979–80 season, a year after his selection. With a new owner in place, Auerbach made a number of moves that would create a whole new dynasty. Auerbach traded the unhappy McAdoo, a former NBA scoring champion, to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for guard M.L. Carr, a defensive specialist, and two first-round picks in the 1980 NBA draft. He also picked up point guard Gerald Henderson from the CBA. Carr, Archibald, Henderson and Ford would form a highly competent backcourt, with their unique skills blending in perfectly with the talented frontcourt of Cowens, Maxwell and Bird, who would go on to win NBA Rookie of the Year honors. The Celtics improved by 32 games, at the time the best single-season turnaround in NBA history, going 61–21 and losing to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals. After the season, Auerbach completed what may be the most lopsided trade in NBA history. Auerbach had been known for stockpiling draft picks, so even after the success of 1979–80 the Celtics had both the 1st and 13th picks in the 1980 NBA draft left over from the M.L. Carr trade. Auerbach saw an opportunity to improve the team immediately, sending the two picks to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for center Robert Parish and the Warriors first round pick, the 3rd overall. With the draft pick, Auerbach selected University of Minnesota power forward Kevin McHale. The acquisitions along with Bird gave the Celtics three future Hall of Famers, forming a core that became known as the \\"Big Three\\" while leading the Celtics to three NBA championships in the 1980s. The Celtics went 62–20 under coach Bill Fitch in 1980–81, despite losing center Dave Cowens to retirement late in training camp. Once again the Celtics matched up with the 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Celtics fell behind 3 games to 1 before coming back to win a classic 7th game, 91–90. The Celtics went on to capture the 1981 NBA Championship over the Houston Rockets, just two years after Bird had been drafted. Maxwell was named NBA Finals MVP. The Celtics only reached the Eastern Conference finals in 1982, losing to Philadelphia in 7 games. The following season culminated in an embarrassing second round playoff loss in the 1983 NBA Playoffs to the Milwaukee Bucks, 4 games to 0. Ford had retired after 1982 and Archibald's age, declining skills and injury problems led to his release after the 1982–83. Fitch was fired, and K.C. Jones was named head coach. Archibald was replaced when popular reserve forward Rick Robey, a close friend of Bird, was traded to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for point guard Dennis Johnson, a former Finals MVP himself. With Johnson starting alongside ex-CBA player Gerald Henderson, and former Toronto Blue Jays third baseman Danny Ainge, veterans Quinn Buckner and M.L. Carr coming off the bench, the Celtics once again had the backcourt depth to complement their talented frontline. In 1983–84 the Celtics would go 62–20 and finally get back to the NBA Finals after a three-year hiatus. In the final, the Celtics came back from a 2–1 deficit to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers, winning their 15th championship. Bird renewed his college rivalry with Lakers star Magic Johnson during this series. After the series the Celtics traded Henderson, whose dramatic steal in game 2 altered the course of the series and gave the Celtics a chance, to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for their first round pick in the 1986 NBA draft. In 1985, the Lakers and Celtics would meet again, but this time the Lakers would take the championship. During the following offseason the Celtics acquired Bill Walton from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Cedric Maxwell. Walton was a star with the Portland Trail Blazers, but injuries had kept him from living up to expectations. He was also a lifelong Celtics fan and willing to come off the bench, deferring to the three big men already with the team. Walton would be a big part of the Celtics' success in 1986. In 1985–86 the Celtics fielded one of the best teams in NBA history. The 1986 Celtics won 67 games, going 40–1 at their home, the Boston Garden. Bird won his third consecutive MVP award after having arguably his finest season, and Walton won the Sixth Man of the Year Award. They would win their 16th championship, easily defeating the Houston Rockets in the NBA Finals. =Drafting of Len Bias, his death and aftermath= Thanks to the 1984 trade of Gerald Henderson and the subsequent fall of the Seattle SuperSonics, at the end of the 1985–86 season, the Celtics not only had the best team in the NBA, but they also had the second overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft. The Celtics drafted Len Bias with the pick and had high hopes for the young University of Maryland star. Fans believed Bias had superstar potential, and that he would be the perfect complement to the aging, but still strong, Celtics. The hope was that his presence would ensure that the franchise would remain a powerhouse after Bird, McHale and Parish retired. However, Bias died 48 hours after he was drafted, after using cocaine at a party and overdosing. Despite the loss of Bias, the Celtics remained competitive in 1986–87, going 59–23 and again winning the Eastern Conference Championship. However, in the Finals the tired, aging, and injured Celtics ran into perhaps the best Los Angeles Lakers team of the decade. The biggest injury was yet another foot injury for Bill Walton, who only played 10 regular season games in 1986–87 after playing 80 games the year before. Walton fought through the injury, playing 12 games (out of 23) in the playoffs, but was not the same player as he was the year before. McHale, Parish and Ainge were also fighting injuries, forcing reserves Darren Daye and Fred Roberts to play larger roles in the series, which the Celtics lost 4 games to 2. The Celtics started the 1987–88 season without Kevin McHale, who was recovering from a foot injury that had hobbled him in the 1987 playoffs. Bill Walton was also recovering from injury, and while Walton stuck with the franchise for the 1987–88 and 1988–89 seasons, he had played his last game in the NBA in the 1987 NBA Playoffs. The Celtics did add some new players in the 1987 NBA draft. In the first round, the Celtics selected a promising guard/forward out of Northeastern University by the name of Reggie Lewis. The Celtics also added Brad Lohaus in the second round, giving head coach K.C. Jones a few more weapons to choose from. Jones was not one to play rookies, however, and both Lewis and Lohaus spent much of the 1987–88 season on the bench while Jones continued to play his veterans. The team won another division title, finishing 57–25 and earning home court advantage throughout the playoffs. Jones' reliance on his veterans came back to haunt him in the playoffs, as the Celtics appeared tired and worn down. Danny Ainge had played the most minutes of his career, and Bird's body was starting to wear down after averaging 39 minutes per game. The Celtics struggled to defeat the Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, needed a 20-point 4th quarter from Larry Bird in the decisive game 7 to finally put the Hawks away 118–116. Emotionally and physically drained from the Hawks series, the Celtics fell in the Eastern Conference Finals to the Detroit Pistons, 4 games to 2. After the 1987–88 season, head coach K.C. Jones retired. Jones' teams had had the best regular season record in the Eastern Conference in all five of his seasons as coach. In addition, he led the Celtics to four NBA Finals appearances and two NBA Championships. Jones was replaced as head coach by assistant Jimmy Rodgers. Rodgers faced immediate trouble in 1988–89 when, 6 games into the season, Bird decided to have surgery to remove bone spurs in both feet. The injury was expected to sideline Bird until well after the All-Star Break, when presumably he would be able to return. However, he was unable to make it back as the Celtics stumbled to a 42–40 record and a first round playoff defeat to the Detroit Pistons. Bird returned in 1989–90 to play in 75 games and led the Celtics to a 52–30 record. The season was not completely smooth sailing, as second year guard Brian Shaw caused a stir when he held out of the season for a bigger contract, instead playing the entire season in Italy. However, in the playoffs, after winning the first two games of a Best of 5 series against the New York Knicks the Celtics collapsed, losing 3 straight, including the decisive 5th game at the Boston Garden. In the wake of the defeat, Rodgers was fired and replaced by assistant coach (and former Celtic player) Chris Ford. Under Ford's leadership, the Celtics improved to 56–26 in 1990–91, recapturing the Atlantic Division title even though Bird missed 22 games with a variety of injuries and Parish and McHale's skills had begun to decline. McHale was never the same after playing through the 1987 Finals with a broken foot. Most significant were the developing back problems that hobbled Bird, causing him to miss one playoff game. Reggie Lewis blossomed into a star, and swingman Kevin Gamble provided a consistent scoring presence when Bird was out of the lineup. Shaw returned from Italy and teamed with rookie Dee Brown at the point guard spot. In the playoffs, the Celtics First round series against the Indiana Pacers was highlighted by a climactic game 5 win in the Boston Garden. Bird left the game midway through the second quarter after hitting his head hard on the parquet floor while diving for a loose ball. He sustained a concussion & a broken eye socket, though he returned in the third quarter and electrified the crowd after the Pacers had grabbed the lead. The Celtics won the game behind Bird's 32 points and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semi-finals, where they lost to their longtime nemesis, the Detroit Pistons, 4 games to 2. In 1992, a late- season rally allowed the Celtics to catch the Knicks and repeat as Atlantic Division champions. The team finished 51–31 and again matched up with the Indiana Pacers in the first round, this time sweeping the series 3 games to 0. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Celtics lost a grueling 7 game series to the Cleveland Cavaliers, 4 games to 3. Due to back problems, Larry Bird played in only 45 of the 82 regular season games, and only 4 of the 10 playoff games. After thirteen seasons with the club and winning a gold medal in the Barcelona Olympics with the Dream Team, Bird retired in 1992 primarily due to his back injuries. 1993–2001: Tragedy and decline At the time of Bird's retirement former Celtics guard Chris Ford was the coach of the Celtics. Twenty-six-year-old Reggie Lewis (out of Boston's Northeastern University) was seen as Bird's successor as the franchise player for the Celtics. In Bird's final season it was Lewis who led the team in scoring, and he made his first All-Star appearance in the 1992 All-Star Game. Lewis, a small forward, fainted during a 1993 first round playoff matchup with the Charlotte Hornets. It was later revealed that Lewis had heart problems, yet he was able to get doctors to clear him for a comeback. He died of a heart attack after participating in a pickup basketball game during the offseason. The Celtics honored his memory during the following season by retiring his number 35. The team took another hit after the season, as Kevin McHale retired after 13 seasons in the NBA. The Celtics were now down to one member of the \\"Big Three\\" for the 1993–94, as well as without Lewis, their captain and young star. The Celtics drafted Acie Earl in the first round of the 1993 NBA draft, and planned on making him Parish's successor in the middle. After missing the playoffs for the first time since 1978–79, the year before Bird joined the franchise, Robert Parish left as a free agent to join the Charlotte Hornets. The time of \\"Big Three\\" was officially over. In 1994, the Celtics hired former player M.L. Carr to be the team's new G.M. In his first draft in charge of the Celtics, he drafted University of North Carolina star Eric Montross with his first round draft pick. The Acie Earl era was already nearing an end, as Montross became the new heir apparent in the paint. 1994–95 was the Celtics final season in the Boston Garden. The Celtics signed the aging Dominique Wilkins as a free agent, and he led the team in scoring with 17.8 PPG. Second- year player Dino Rađa, a power forward from Croatia, added an interior presence to the team that had been lacking in 1993–94. The Celtics made the playoffs, losing to the heavily favored Orlando Magic in 4 games. In 1995, the Celtics moved from the Boston Garden into the Fleet Center (renamed the TD Banknorth Garden in 2005). Carr fired Chris Ford and took the coaching reins himself. After drafting Providence College star Eric Williams, the Celtics struggled to a 33–49 record. Things got worse in 1996–97 as the Celtics lost a franchise record 67 games, winning only 15 times despite the emergence of 1st- round draft pick Antoine Walker. =Pitino years= Carr stepped aside to another job in the organization when the Celtics convinced Rick Pitino to join the franchise as the team's president, front office manager, and head coach. Pitino had led the University of Kentucky to an NCAA Championship and was a very successful head coach at the college level, with a short NBA stint with the New York Knicks several years prior. Some controversy was generated when Pitino was given the title of team \\"President\\", taking such title away from Red Auerbach (Auerbach, who by 1997 was holding the title in a \\"ceremonial\\" way, became the \\"Vice Chairman of the Board\\") Unfortunately for the Celtics, Pitino was not the savior everyone expected him to be, although he did acquire several talented young players during his tenure. The Celtics, after going 15–67 in 1996–97, had the best chance at winning the NBA's draft lottery in 1997. Their odds were augmented even further by a 1996 trade that sent Eric Montross to Dallas in exchange for the Mavericks 1st round pick in 1997 (as well as a swap in draft picks in 1996 that allowed the Celtics to move up to select Walker), which gave the Celtics a second lottery pick and more chances to win the coveted first pick. The San Antonio Spurs won the lottery and selected Tim Duncan first overall in the 1997 NBA draft. The Celtics received the third and sixth picks, and used the picks to select a brand new backcourt through Chauncey Billups and Ron Mercer. Much of the young team that lost 67 games the year before was dismantled: David Wesley and Rick Fox were let go, and Williams was traded to the Denver Nuggets for a pair of second round draft picks. Walter McCarty was also acquired in a trade with the Knicks. The Celtics seemed ready to pair Billups and Mercer with Antoine Walker, the second-year player out of Kentucky who was coming off a solid rookie season. Unfortunately, two of these players would not remain as fixtures on the team in the long term: Billups was sent to the Toronto Raptors by the trade deadline, and Mercer was traded to the Nuggets during his third season. What the Hell Happened to ... Ron Mercer?, celticslife.com May 25, 2012. Retrieved June 13, 2012. The team still had a promising start, upsetting the defending champions Chicago Bulls at home on opening night, and hard play from the youngsters that led to leaderships in turnovers and steals, improving its victories from 15 to 36 despite many losing streaks. The following year the Celtics drafted Paul Pierce, a college star who had been expected to be drafted much higher than the Celtics' number 10 pick overall. Pierce had an immediate impact during the lockout-shortened 1998–99 NBA season, being named Rookie of The Month in February as he led the league in steals. However, the team continued to struggle, finishing only fifth in its division with a 19–31 record. The following season, Mercer was sent to the Nuggets in return to Danny Fortson and a returning Eric Williams, who had only played 42 games in two seasons in Colorado following a knee injury. Pitino's promises of improvement still did not realize, with a losing season in 1999–2000 and a bad start to the 2000–01 season that led to record low attendances at the FleetCenter.PRO BASKETBALL; Pitino Still Searching for Right Formula, The New York Times. December 21, 2000. Retrieved January 9, 2001. Eventually Pitino resigned in January 2001, leaving the Celtics in the hands of assistant coach Jim O'Brien, a friend of Pitino's who had followed Pitino to the Celtics.Pitino's resignation doesn't mean an end to his career, sportsillustrated.cnn.com January 8, 2001. Retrieved January 9, 2001. Chris Wallace became the general manager of the team and the title of \\"Team President\\" was returned to Red Auerbach. 2001–2006: Attempts to rebuild =Back to contention – O'Brien years= Following the resignation of Rick Pitino, the Celtics improved greatly under coach Jim O'Brien. Paul Pierce matured into an NBA star and was ably complemented by Antoine Walker, along with the other role players acquired over the years. The team finished the season going 24–24 under O'Brien (after going 12–22 before Pitino's resignation) and following the 2000–01 season O'Brien was given the job of head coach on a permanent basis. As a result of numerous trades, the Celtics had three picks in the 2001 NBA draft, a luxury that seemed to set the franchise up well for the long term. General Manager Chris Wallace used the picks on Joe Johnson, Joe Forte (a favorite of Red Auerbach) and Kedrick Brown. The Celtics entered the 2001–02 season with low expectations. The team's success in the latter stages of 2000–01 was largely forgotten, and critics were surprised when the team (along with the New Jersey Nets) surged to the top of the Atlantic Division ahead of teams like the Philadelphia 76ers, who were fresh off a trip to the NBA Finals. A trade at the February trade deadline sent Joe Johnson, who was having an inconsistent rookie season, along with little-used bench players Randy Brown and Milt Palacio to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Tony Delk and Rodney Rogers. The season salvaged by the trade, the Celtics went on to win 49 games. The 49 victories were the franchises most since 1992, when Larry Bird was still playing, and the Celtics made the playoffs for the first time since 1995. The Celtics won a hard-fought five game series with the 76ers in the first round, 3 games to 2. Pierce scored 46 points in the series-clinching blowout at the Fleet Center. In the conference semifinals the Celtics defeated the favored Detroit Pistons 4 games to 1 in a series best remembered for the Celtics low-scoring (66–64) game 3 victory. In their first trip to the Eastern Conference Finals since 1988, the Celtics would jump out to a 2–1 series lead over the New Jersey Nets (after rallying from 21 points down in the fourth quarter to win game 3) but would lose the next three games to fall 4 games to 2. Following their defeat at the hands of the Nets, the Celtics once again overhauled their roster. Gone were Rodney Rogers, who signed with new rival New Jersey as a free agent, Vitaly Potapenko, Kenny Anderson and Joe Forte, who were sent to Seattle in a five- player trade that brought Vin Baker and Shammond Williams to Boston. In 2003, the Celtics were sold by owner Paul Gaston to Boston Basketball Partners LLC, led by H. Irving Grousbeck, Wycliffe Grousbeck, Steve Pagliuca, Robert Epstein, David Epstein, and John Svenson. The team made it back to the playoffs but were swept by the Nets in the second round, despite bringing Game 4 to double overtime. Before their elimination, the team hired Danny Ainge to take over the front office, pushing Chris Wallace to another job in the organization. Ainge believed the team had reached its peak and promptly stunned the team by sending Antoine Walker to the Dallas Mavericks (along with Tony Delk). In return, the Celtics received the oft-injured Raef LaFrentz and a first-round draft pick in 2004. =Rebuilding anew – Ainge years= On the heels of the off-season Walker trade, Ainge continued to dismantle O'Brien's team with a midseason trade that sent Eric Williams, Tony Battie, and struggling Kedrick Brown to Cleveland in exchange for troubled guard Ricky Davis, center Chris Mihm and center Michael Stewart. Reportedly distraught by this trade, O'Brien stepped down during the 2003–04 Season and was replaced by interim coach John Carroll. Davis proved to be an exciting player, and Welsch an offensive threat from three-point range (albeit an inconsistent one), but neither was capable of playing the tenacious defense that had become a trademark of O'Brien's teams. Vin Baker proved to be not up to the task of playing near his home state of Connecticut; alcoholism forced the Celtics to first suspend him, then void his contract. He played only 37 games for the Celtics in 2004, and 17 more with the New York Knicks in a minor role. The acquisition of LaFrentz also proved problematic, as LaFrentz's chronic knee problems acted up and forced the big man to miss all but 17 games. Still, with Pierce playing at his usual level, Davis providing a second scoring punch, and occasional help from rookie Marcus Banks at point guard the Celtics prepared for yet another playoff run. In February, the Celtics helped their former nemeses, the Detroit Pistons acquire Rasheed Wallace for their own title run, sending Mike James off to Detroit in exchange for a 1st-round pick as well as Chucky Atkins, who would provide the Celtics with a stabilizing veteran point guard to go with the inconsistent Banks. The Celtics made the playoffs only to be badly swept in the first round by the Indiana Pacers losing all 4 by blowout margins. Ainge received a lot of criticism for dismantling the previous team, but he attempted to redeem himself in the draft. After selecting Banks and center Kendrick Perkins in 2003, Ainge added high school power forward Al Jefferson, St. Joseph's University standout Delonte West (with the Mavericks pick from the Antoine Walker trade), and the athletic Tony Allen (with the Pistons 1st-round pick acquired in the Atkins-James swap) in 2004. During his second off-season, Ainge was able to unload some payroll when he acquired veterans Gary Payton and Rick Fox from the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Mihm, Atkins and bench player Jumaine Jones. Fox retired rather than rejoin the team and Payton threatened to hold out of training camp, but he eventually ended up playing for the team during the 2004–05 Season. The Celtics were a young team under new coach Doc Rivers, yet they seemed to have a core of good young players, led by rookie Al Jefferson, to go along with a selection of able veterans (Paul Pierce, a now-healthy Raef LaFrentz, and Ricky Davis). Before the trading deadline in the winter of 2005 the Celtics re-acquired Antoine Walker when they dealt Gary Payton to the Atlanta Hawks (Payton would re-sign with the team after being released from the Hawks a week later). With Walker back in the fold, the Celtics improved enormously. The Celtics went 45–37 and won their first Atlantic Division title since 1991–92. The Pacers defeated them in the first round yet again, with the series culminating in an embarrassing 27 point 7th game loss at the Fleet Center. At the conclusion of the 2004–05 season Payton and Walker both became free agents. Walker was sent to the Miami Heat in a multi-team sign-and-trade deal (the largest trade in NBA history) that brought the Celtics Qyntel Woods and Curtis Borchardt, both of whom would later be released, two future second- round draft picks, the rights to Spanish center Albert Miralles, and cash. Payton later chose to sign with the Heat as well. Ainge brought in a few more young players during the draft, including Gerald Green, Ryan Gomes, and Orien Greene. Ainge also added the veteran Brian Scalabrine, signing Scalabrine to a 5-year/$15 million contract. Celtics in a game versus the Miami Heat at the TD Banknorth Garden in April 2006 During the 2005–06 season, Ainge traded Davis, Blount, Banks, Justin Reed, and two conditional second-round draft picks to the Minnesota Timberwolves for forward Wally Szczerbiak, centers Michael Olowokandi and Dwayne Jones, and a first-round pick. Many were skeptical about this decision. However, Ainge stated more than once that he was committed to continuing the rebuilding process under team captain Paul Pierce, who played some of the best basketball of his career in 2006. Despite Pierce's excellence, the Celtics missed the 2006 playoffs with a 33–49 record. =2006 off-season= The Boston Celtics continued to rebuild on the night of the 2006 NBA draft. Danny Ainge traded the rights to seventh overall pick Randy Foye, Dan Dickau and Raef LaFrentz to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Sebastian Telfair, Theo Ratliff, and a future second-round pick. A subsequent trade with the Philadelphia 76ers for Allen Iverson was reported as a potential move beneficial to each team, although such a trade never happened and Iverson was shipped to the Denver Nuggets in December. Orien Greene was waived, and the Celtics replaced him by trading a first-round pick in the 2007 NBA draft to the Phoenix Suns for the rights to Rajon Rondo. In the second round the Celtics added Leon Powe to the team, and later signed Villanova star Allan Ray as an undrafted free agent. =2006–07 season= The 2006–07 season was a gloomy one for the franchise. The season began with the death of Red Auerbach at the age of 89. Auerbach was one of the few remaining people who had been a part of the NBA since its inception in 1946. The Celtics went 2–22 from late December 2006 through early February 2007 after losing Paul Pierce to injury, the result of a stress reaction in his left foot (he would later miss the latter part of March and all of April because of swelling in his left elbow). At first, the Celtics received a much needed boost from guard Tony Allen but he tore his ACL on a dunk attempt in a game vs. the Indiana Pacers on January 10, 2007. The Celtics recorded a record of 24–58, second-worst in the NBA, including a franchise record 18-game losing streak that lasted from January 5 to February 14. As the streak grew, some suggested that Pierce sit out the rest of the season to the let the young players such as Al Jefferson, Gerald Green, Rajon Rondo and Delonte West get more experience. Green became the second Celtic, joining Dee Brown, to capture the Slam Dunk Contest during All-Star Weekend. On February 22, 2007, former Celtic Dennis Johnson died at the age of 52. Johnson had been coaching the franchise's NBDL affiliate in Austin, Texas at the time of his death. Johnson was honored at the very next Celtics game, even though it was against the Lakers in Los Angeles. The Celtics also held a special ceremony for him at the Garden on February 28, 2007, before a game against the New York Knicks. One bright spot of the season happened on St. Patrick's Day against the eventual champions San Antonio Spurs. The Celtics beat the Spurs 91–85, ending the 17-year away drought at San Antonio, as well as the 10-year drought against the Spurs (Boston's first victory against Tim Duncan). On April 18, the team promoted COO Rich Gotham to President. 2007–present: Back to relevance =2007–08: Back to glory= On May 22, the Celtics were assigned the 5th overall selection in the NBA Draft Lottery, essentially losing their chance of drafting either Greg Oden or Kevin Durant, who both were considered to go 1st and 2nd in the Draft. The 5th pick was the worst-case scenario for the Celtics, who had a 19.9% chance of obtaining the 1st overall selection. However, on June 28, the day of the 2007 NBA draft, the Celtics traded the 5th pick along with Wally Szczerbiak and Delonte West to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for All-Star 3-point specialist Ray Allen and the 35th overall selection prior to the event, and with the 5th pick selected forward Jeff Green for Seattle. In the second round of the Draft, the Celtics selected guard Gabe Pruitt with the 32nd pick, which was their own, and forward Glen \\"Big Baby\\" Davis with the 35th pick, previously obtained from Seattle. On July 31, the Celtics traded for 10-time All-Star and 2004 MVP Kevin Garnett in the single largest trade for one player in NBA history. He was acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Al Jefferson, Ryan Gomes, Theo Ratliff, Gerald Green, Sebastian Telfair, Boston's 2009 first-round draft pick (top three protected), the return of Minnesota's conditional first-round draft pick previously obtained in the 2006 Ricky Davis-Wally Szczerbiak trade and cash considerations. By adding Garnett to All-Stars Paul Pierce and Ray Allen, the trade brought a new era of relevancy to the long struggling franchise, but it also left the roster short- handed. Adding depth became an immediate concern. The Celtics followed the Garnett trade by signing guards Eddie House and Jackie Manuel,Celts sign Eddie House, Boston HeraldChris Sheridan, Boston starts to rebuild roster, signs House to one-year deal, ESPN.com and later center Scot Pollard.Pollard solidifies bench, Boston Herald Later, Ainge called and asked 5-time All-Star Reggie Miller to return from his 2-year retirement and join the roster in a reserve role.J.A. Adande, Celtics call Miller, who is considering return to NBA, ESPN.com, August 10, 2007 Miller strongly considered the possibility of playing alongside Garnett, but ultimately decided not to join the Celtics. On August 27, forward James Posey signed with the team and was considered a decisive signing which instantly gave the Celtics a drastic improvement to their bench. On September 26, center Esteban Batista and guard Dahntay Jones signed non-guaranteed contracts with the Celtics, two days before the beginning of training camp and the team's departure to Rome for the 2007 NBA Europe Live Tour.Peter May, Camp Roster Set, The Boston Globe Curiously, Jones was involved in a trade back in the 2003 NBA draft, in which the Celtics drafted him with the 20th overall selection, but immediately traded him with the 16th pick, Troy Bell, to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for the 13th pick, Marcus Banks, and the 27th pick, Kendrick Perkins. Ultimately, the Celtics waived Batista on October 16, and Manuel and Jones on October 25, bringing the roster down to 14 players, one shy of the league maximum of 15 players, in order to have roster flexibility and be able to sign another player midway through the season.Marc J. Spears, Wallace in, Jones and Manuel out, The Boston Globe The Celtics started the season hot, winning their first eight games, and going into 2008 with a 26–3 record. Before 2007 closed, Brandon Wallace was released in order to have even more roster flexibility, bringing the roster down to the league minimum of 13 players.Peter May, Rookie Wallace gets cut loose, The Boston Globe, December 19, 2007 During the 2008 NBA All-Star Weekend, Allen and Pierce invited resting center P.

Spears, Cassell update, The Boston Globe, March 4, 2008. The regular season had the Celtics finish with a league-high 66–16 record, which was also the most wins in a single season since their previous championship season of . Their record guaranteed them home court advantage for the entire playoffs. The 2008 NBA Playoffs, however, were bumpier than many believed they should be. Their First round series was against the eighth-seeded Atlanta Hawks. At home, the Celtics were dominant: their lowest home margin of victory against the Hawks in the playoffs was 19, in Game 2. However, the Hawks were able to beat the Celtics in Atlanta. The series went seven games, with the home team winning each game. The second round against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers also went to seven games, with each match won by the home team. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics faced Chauncey Billups, Richard Hamilton and the Detroit Pistons. In Game 2, the Celtics finally lost at home, and rumors began to fly that the Celtics had gotten too tired from consecutive seven-game series to pull off a title, especially with the Pistons having taken their first two series in six and five games, respectively. But the Celtics bounced back to win Game 3 on the road in Detroit. The series continued, and the Celtics took down the Pistons in six games, winning the deciding game on the road. The 2008 NBA Finals were contested with Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom and a Los Angeles Lakers team in the middle of a dominant playoff run. They swept the Denver Nuggets in the first round, took the Utah Jazz in the second round in six games, and extinguished the repeat hopes of the defending-champion San Antonio Spurs in five games in the Western Conference Finals. The first few games of the series started with the Celtics once again dominating at the TD Banknorth Garden, the Celtics home turf. Game 1 saw Paul Pierce come back after apparently suffering a knee injury earlier in the game, and taking over the game for a 98–88 Celtics win. But in Game 2, Boston nearly lost a 20-point lead, ultimately winning, 97–91. Squandered leads would later become the story of the series. When the Lakers returned to Staples Center and won Game 3, 87–81, then took a 24-point lead in the second quarter of Game 4, some believed momentum in the series had shifted the Lakers' way. However, the Celtics did not give up. Led by a bench that outscored the Lakers bench by 20 points, they fought back. The Celtics locked up their defense and took over Game 4 with a crushing 97–91 victory, the biggest comeback in NBA Finals history. Although the Lakers took Game 5, 103–98, the series went back to Boston for Game 6, and the Celtics finished it off with a dominating 131–92 victory. This game would mark the largest margin of victory for a clinching finals game in NBA history. The \\"Boston Three Party\\", as Garnett, Allen and NBA Finals MVP Paul Pierce became known, had finally brought a 17th banner to Boston, the first new banner for the new Garden and the first such win in 22 years. Indicating the bumpy the playoffs were for the Celtics, they had to play 26 playoff games, the most a team had ever endured in a single postseason, surpassing the 1994 New York Knicks, whom Celtics Coach Doc Rivers played for, and the 2005 Detroit Pistons, each of whom played 25, but lost their respective finals in seven games (Knicks in , Pistons in ). This record was set in Game 6 of the Finals. It was also the most a team needed to win a championship, surpassing the 1988 Los Angeles Lakers, who needed 24 in order to win the championship that year. =After the championship= 2008–09 season. Clockwise from top: Paul Pierce (34), Kevin Garnett embracing Rajon Rondo, Ray Allen (20) and Tony Allen (42). The Celtics followed up the championship season with more dominance, winning the Atlantic Division with a record of 62–20. Unfortunately, it was announced just before the playoffs that Garnett would miss the entire post-season. In the first round of the 2009 NBA Playoffs, the team faced the seventh seed Chicago Bulls. Although the Celtics were favored, the Bulls surprised them with overtime wins in games 1 and 4. Thanks to Ray Allen and Paul Pierce, Boston had a 3–2 advantage going back to Chicago. In game six, though Ray Allen scored 51 points, the Bulls would win in a dramatic triple-overtime victory thanks to John Salmons, Ben Gordon and eventual NBA Rookie of the Year Derrick Rose. The Celtics, however would ultimately prevail in game 7. In the second round, Boston faced the Orlando Magic in a series that would also go to seven games. However, aided by Hedo Türkoğlu's 25 points, the Magic would defeat the Celtics in Boston 101–82, ending their bid for a second straight title. Prior to the 2009–10 NBA Season, Boston signed Rasheed Wallace. Wallace had had a major impact in his 5½ seasons with the Detroit Pistons, where he had won the 2004 NBA Championship. They won the Atlantic Division with a record of 50–32, then beat Miami 4–1 in the playoffs, followed by the Cavaliers 4–2. After a 4–2 series over the Magic in the ECF, the Celtics once again contested the Finals with the Lakers, but fell to them 4–3, with games 1, 2, 6, and 7 played in Los Angeles. The 2010 off-season saw the Celtics make the controversial move of signing veteran center Shaquille O'Neal for the veteran minimum salary, as he added still more age to a roster with most of its players over 30. They won the division again with a 56–26 record and acquired the No. 3 playoff seed. After sweeping the Knicks 4–0, they faced the now LeBron James-led Miami Heat, but the age of the Celtics' roster finally caught up with them as Miami won the series 4–1. Shaquille O'Neal, who had been injured much of the season, retired shortly afterwards, ending a nearly two-decade HoFer career. At the 2011 NBA draft, the Celtics selected Providence swingman MarShon Brooks with the 25th overall pick then immediately traded his rights to the Brooklyn Nets for the rights to the 27th overall pick, power forward JaJuan Johnson. Then the Celtics selected E'Twaun Moore with the 55th overall pick in the 2nd round (reason being for his choice of #55), which reunited the Purdue teammates. During the short preseason following the 2011 NBA lockout, the Celtics signed free agents Marquis Daniels, Chris Wilcox, Keyon Dooling and Greg Stiemsma, while acquiring Brandon Bass from the Magic for Glen Davis and Von Wafer. They also re-signed Jeff Green, only to have it voided after a physical revealed that Green was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm, forcing him to miss the season. The Celtics started the season 0–3 with Paul Pierce out with a heel injury. To fill the void, the Celtics signed French swingman Mickaël Piétrus, but did not make his season debut until January 6, 2012 against the Indiana Pacers. The Celtics, however, continued to struggle, at one point posting a five-game losing streak that was the longest in the 'Big Three' era. At the All Star break, the Celtics were below .500 with a 15–17 record. However, they were one of the hottest teams after the break, going 24–10 the rest of the year and winning their 5th division title in a row. The Celtics would end up making the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference in the 2012 NBA Playoffs. In the playoffs, the Celtics faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, beating them in six games led by strong play from Pierce and Garnett. In the Conference Semifinals the Celtics faced the Philadelphia 76ers led by Doug Collins and a young group of promising players that would push the Celtics into a full-seven game series. Following a Game 7 85–75 win the Celtics faced the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, who had defeated them in the playoffs the previous year. After losing Game 1 93–79, Boston fought back, pushing Miami into a Game 2 overtime, but ultimately fell short losing 115–111. Facing a 0–2 deficit heading back to Boston, the Celtics would come back with a strong 101–91 Game 3 win and then a hard-fought 93–91 Game 4 overtime win, with Dwyane Wade missing a potential game-winning three- point shot at the buzzer. The C's then won Game 5 in Miami 94–90, giving them a chance to take the series back at the Garden. The Celtics couldn't close out the series however. Game 6 ended up in a blowout home loss of 98-79 taking the series back to Miami for Game 7, where the Celtics built an early lead but eventually lost 101–88; Miami would go on to defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Finals. End of the \\"Big Three\\" Rajon Rondo became the Celtics' leader once the Big Three left. 2012 was a pivotal year to Danny Ainge's Celtics, as both Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett became free agents and In the 2012 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted three players, Jared Sullinger, Fab Melo and Kris Joseph with their 21st, 22nd and 51st picks respectively. While Garnett renewed, Allen chose to sign with the Miami Heat for less money, bringing the five-year \\"Big Three\\" era to a somewhat acrimonious end. The Celtics also signed free agents Jason Terry, Jason Collins, Leandro Barbosa and Darko Miličić, acquired Courtney Lee in a three-team sign and trade – where Johnson, Moore, Sean Williams and a future second round pick were sent to the Houston Rockets and the Portland Trail Blazers got Sasha Pavlovic – and renewed with Brandon Bass and Keyon Dooling along with Chris Wilcox and Jeff Green, who both were returning to play after sustaining season-ending heart ailments. Dooling wound up waived, and briefly hired as player development coordinator for the Celtics before a half-season signing with the Memphis Grizzlies. Later in the season, it was announced that Miličić would return to Europe for a family matter. On December 24, the Celtics signed forward Jarvis Varnado of the NBA D-League team Sioux Falls to a deal. He was then waived on January 6 along with rookie forward Kris Joseph. On January 27, 2013, it was revealed that Rajon Rondo had torn the ACL on his right knee and would miss the rest of the season along with part of the next season. On February 2, it was announced that Jared Sullinger would also miss the rest of the season due to back surgery. Despite losing Rondo and Sullinger to injury, the Celtics compiled a seven-game winning streak, including victories over the Heat in double overtime and the Nuggets in triple overtime. The winning streak was snapped on February 12 when Leandro Barbosa suffered a torn ACL; he would miss the rest of the season as well. Then on February 18, the Celtics signed swingman Terrence Williams to a deal. On February 21, the Celtics traded Leandro Barbosa and center Jason Collins for Washington Wizards guard Jordan Crawford. On February 28 and March 21, respectively, the Celtics signed forwards D. J. White and Shavlik Randolph. The Celtics finished the season with 41 wins, but played only 81 games after a home game against the Indiana Pacers on April 16 was cancelled following the Boston Marathon bombing; the game was not made up with both teams already assured of their playoff positions. The 41 wins were the lowest totals the Celtics achieved as a playoff-bound team since 2004. The Celtics trailed 3–0 to the New York Knicks in the first round of the 2013 NBA Playoffs, before losing the series in six games. In Game 6, the Celtics nearly completed a comeback when they went on a 20–0 run to cut the lead to 4, but that was the closest they got as the New York Knicks would take over to win. On June 3, 2013, head coach Doc Rivers was allowed out of his contract to coach Los Angeles Clippers and the Celtics were given a 2015 unprotected first round pick as compensation. A few days later, Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett (after waiving his no-trade clause), along with Jason Terry and D. J. White, were traded to the Brooklyn Nets for Keith Bogans, MarShon Brooks, Kris Humphries, Kris Joseph, Gerald Wallace, and three future first-round draft picks (2014, 2016, 2018), with the option of swapping 2018 pick with Brooklyn's 2017 pick. The deal was later approved by the league on July 12, 2013, effectively ending the 'Big 3' era and marking the start of a youth movement for the team. One of the leaders of said movement was 2013 draft pick Kelly Olynyk. = 2013–2016: Rebuilding/Brad Stevens era= Brad Stevens is the Boston Celtics current head coach. On July 3, 2013, Butler University head coach Brad Stevens was hired to replace Doc Rivers as head coach. On January 15 the Celtics traded Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for future first and second round picks as well as Miami Heat center Joel Anthony. On January 19th, Rajon Rondo made his return from an ACL tear. He was named the new Captain of the Boston Celtics, the 15th Team Captain in team history. The 2013–14 season marked Boston's first failure to qualify for the playoffs since 2007. The next off- season, the Celtics drafted Marcus Smart with the 6th overall pick and James Young with the 17th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft. The Celtics would also sign Evan Turner. On December 18, 2014, Rondo and rookie Dwight Powell were traded to Dallas for center Brandan Wright, forward Jae Crowder, veteran point guard Jameer Nelson, and future picks. The Celtics would make several roster moves the next few months acquiring Isaiah Thomas, Luigi Datome, and Jonas Jerebko. On February 23, it was announced that Sullinger, the team's leading scorer and rebounder, would miss the remainder of the season with a left metatarsal stress fracture; Sullinger returned on April 3, 2015, on limited minutes. The Celtics finished the season with a 40–42 record, but still managed to clinch the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs. The Celtics were swept by the second seeded Cleveland Cavaliers, in the first round of the 2015 NBA Playoffs In the 2015 NBA draft Boston selected Terry Rozier, R. J. Hunter, Jordan Mickey, and Marcus Thornton with the 16th, 28th, 33rd, and 45th selections respectively. In the 2015–16 season, Boston once again made the playoffs under Stevens. They were the fifth seed, finishing 48–34, and they faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round. Boston still couldn't get past the first round, as the Hawks beat them in six games. = 2017-present: Championship contenders = The next season, Boston took the league by storm. They had a hot start, led by Isaiah Thomas. He truly emerged as a star, and with the help of Boston's excellent depth, Boston finished as the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference, with a 53–29 record. Just before the Celtics' first round playoff series against the Chicago Bulls, Thomas' sister Chyna died in a car crash. That led to Thomas being even more dominant, and Boston took the series in six after losing the first two games. That series win was the first since 2012. In the second round, Boston faced the Washington Wizards. Thomas dropped 33 and 53 points on them in Games 1 and 2, respectively. Boston took the series in 7. In the Eastern Conference Finals, Boston faced the Cleveland Cavaliers. Thomas got a hip injury and was ruled out for the season, and the Cavs won the series in five.

It can also be called drift fencing or temporary amphibian fencing (TAF). It consists of a low fence of plastic sheeting, buried a short way into the ground and supported by lightweight posts usually made of wood or plastic. It is used to keep animals out of working areas, to keep them inside safe areas of their habitat, to intercept migration routes, or to control their movement to help their capture for translocation. It may be used in conjunction with pitfall traps placed at the foot of the fence. It is most commonly used in connection with building projects, to minimise harm to protected species. Background =Legislation= The great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) is an amphibian native to the United Kingdom but also widespread across Northern Europe. Whilst it is relatively widespread in the UK (in fact the UK hosts one of the great crested newt's most significant populations), it is rare on a European wide basis. The great crested newt is listed as a \\"strictly protected fauna species\\" under appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats:Annexe II: Strictly protected fauna species Retrieved on 15 September 2008 and consequently is protected under UK legislation through the Wildlife and Countryside Act and the Conservation (Natural Habitat) regulations 1994. Under these regulations it is an offence to intentionally disturb, injure or kill any great crested newt, or disturb or destroy its habitat. Likewise, the Habitats Regulations 2010 do not apply to all newts, and in the case of e.g. smooth newt species, they are protected differently, under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended). =Habitat= The great crested newt's natural habitat requirements are standing fresh water for breeding purposes, but the majority of its time is spent on dry land. They favour semi-natural habitats such as rough grassland, hedgerows and scrub woodland. An individual newt tends to have a range centred upon its breeding pool. The breeding stage of the life cycle takes place in spring, from February through to April. After this it spends much of its time on land, usually within from the breeding pond, but sometimes ranging up to . Unfortunately this life cycle and the use of both terrestrial and aquatic habitas may put the newts into conflict with humans. Brownfield sites often contain very good terrestrial habitat for great crested newts, and land within from newt breeding ponds includes a significant proportion of the UK. =Planning= As part of the planning process for any development, an environmental impact assessment should include an ecological survey, which should in turn identify the potential for loss of habitat and the impact on the local population of great crested newts. If the assessment identifies possible loss of habitat or the potential to kill or disturb individual newts, it will be necessary for the developer to apply to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for a licence. The licence application should set out what measures will be taken to ensure that the local population is not threatened, and how potential loss of habitat can be mitigated. Fencing and trapping To ensure that individual newts are not injured or killed by development activities, it may be necessary to enclose the site in a newt proof fence, trap the individuals within the site and/or remove them to a suitable release site. As the great crested newt is a European strictly protected fauna species, erection of newt fencing or any capture of the animals requires a licence. =Construction= The newt fence usually consists of a plastic membrane partially buried in the ground (usually to about ) The above ground portion being supported by timber stakes placed at regular intervals along the line of the fence. The fence normally has a below ground horizontal return facing out of the site to minimise the risk of newts re- entering the site through the disturbed soil layer. It usually has some form of overhang along the top edge to reduce the possibility of newts climbing over the fence. =Newt fencing types= Fences tend to fall into three basic categories, temporary (less than two years lifespan), semi-permanent (two to five years lifespan) and permanent (greater than two years lifespan). The materials used to construct them tend to vary with the length of time the fence is to remain operable. A temporary fence is normally constructed from UV-stabilised polythene sheet or woven geotextile. Semi-permanent fences are usually constructed from 1mm thick plastic panels. Permanent fences are usually constructed from rigid plastic or galvanised steel panels. In the case of temporary fencing materials, the underground return is created by folding the material at a ° angle along the base of the trench, and the top overhang by rolling the top edge of the membrane over a number of times to create a roll. For permanent fencing, the underground return is sometimes omitted and instead the fence is buried deeper (usually ). The top overhang is created by making a fold in the material at the manufacturing stage. =Newt collection and trapping= Trapping is undertaken through the use of buried buckets (pitfall traps) placed alongside the fence material. The idea being that the newts follow the fence along until they fall into the open bucket. Carpet tiles (terrestrial refuges) may be used in conjunction with or instead of pitfall traps. Again these are placed alongside the fence and provide ideal shelter for newts whilst they are resting (daytime and during dry or cold periods). Once an ecologist is satisfied that all of the newts have been trapped from the site and that the terms of the licence have been met, construction work can begin.

The formation of ice in clouds is required for snow and most rainfall. Dust and soot particles can serve as ice nuclei, but biological ice nuclei are capable of catalyzing freezing at much warmer temperatures. The ice-nucleating bacteria currently known are mostly plant pathogens. Recent research suggests that bacteria may be present in clouds as part of an evolved process of dispersal. Ice- nucleating proteins derived from ice-nucleating bacteria are used for snowmaking.  Plant pathogens  Most known ice-nucleating bacteria are plant pathogens. These pathogens can cause freezing injury in plants. In the United States alone, it has been estimated that frost accounts for approximately $1 billion in crop damage each year. The ice-minus variant of P. syringae is a mutant, lacking the gene responsible for ice-nucleating surface protein production. This lack of surface protein provides a less favorable environment for ice formation. Both strains of P. syringae occur naturally, but recombinant DNA technology has allowed for the synthetic removal or alteration of specific genes, enabling the creation of the ice-minus strain. The introduction of an ice-minus strain of P. syringae to the surface of plants would incur competition between the strains. Should the ice-minus strain win out, the ice nucleate provided by P. syringae would no longer be present, lowering the level of frost development on plant surfaces at normal water freezing temperature (0°C).  Dispersal of bacteria through rainfall  Bacteria present in clouds may have evolved to use rainfall as a means of dispersing themselves. The bacteria are found in snow, soils and seedlings in locations such as Antarctica, the Yukon Territory of Canada and the French Alps, according to Brent Christner, a microbiologist at Louisiana State University. It has been suggested that the bacteria are part of a constant feedback between terrestrial ecosystems and clouds. They may rely on the rainfall to spread to new habitats, in much the same way as plants rely on windblown pollen grains, Christner said, with this possibly a key element of the bacterial life cycle.

Causes From case histories it is known that the toxin is stable as four- month-old pickled quail have been poisonous. Humans vary in their susceptibility; only one in four people who consumed quail soup containing the toxin fell ill. The toxin is apparently fat-soluble as potatoes fried in quail fat have proved poisonous. Coniine from hemlock consumed by quail has been suggested as the cause, though quail resist eating hemlock. Hellebore has also been suggested as the source of the toxin. It has also been asserted that this evidence points to the seeds of the annual woundwort (Stachys annua) being the causal agent. It has been suggested that Galeopsis ladanum seeds are not responsible. Epidemiology Migration routes and season may affect quail risk. Quail are never poisonous outside the migration season nor are the vast majority poisonous while migrating. European common quail migrate along three different flyways each with different poisoning characteristics, at least in 20th century records. The western flyway across Algeria to France is associated with poisonings only on the spring migration and not on the autumn return. The eastern flyway, which funnels down the Nile Valley is the reverse. Poisonings were only reported in the autumn migration before the quail had crossed the Mediterranean. The central flyway across Italy had no associated poisonings. Migrating quail used to be caught and eaten in prodigious numbers (150,000 quail exported from Capri in 1850) but modern farming and droughts in the Sahel have led to a vast reduction in the size of the migrations. Conservation efforts and the availability of farmed quail have also reduced the consumption of these wild birds. Coturnism may well disappear before it is understood. History The condition was certainly known by the 4th century BC to ancient Greek, and subsequently Roman, naturalists, physicians and theologians. The Bible (Numbers 11:31-34) mentions an incident where the Israelites became ill after having consumed large amounts of quail in Sinai. Philo gives a more detailed version of the same Biblical story (The Special Laws: 4: 120-131). Early writers used quail as the standard example of an animal that could eat something poisonous to man without ill effects for themselves. Aristotle (On Plants 820:6-7), Philo (Geoponics: 14: 24), Lucretius (On the Nature of Things: 4: 639-640), Galen (De Temperamentis: 3:4) and Sextus Empiricus (Outlines of Pyrrhonism: 1: 57) all make this point. Central to these ancient accounts is the thesis that quail became toxic to humans after consuming seeds from hellebore or henbane (Hyoscyamus niger). However Sextus Empiricus suggested that quail ate hemlock (Conium maculatum), an idea revived in the 20th century. Confirmation that the ancients understood the problem, comes from a 10th-century text Geoponica, based on ancient sources. This states, \\"Quails may graze hellebore putting those who afterwards eat them at risk of convulsions and vertigo....\\".

History The disease was first described in 1924 in the vicinity of Königsberg, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia) on the Baltic coast, in people staying around the northern part of the Vistula Lagoon (German: Frisches Haff). Over the subsequent fifteen years, about 1000 cases were reported in people, birds and cats, usually in the summer and fall, and a link was made with the consumption of fish (burbot, eel and pike). Since that time, only occasional reports have appeared of the condition, mostly from the Soviet Union and Germany. In 1997, six cases of Haff disease were reported in California and Missouri, all after the consumption of buffalo fish (Ictiobus cyprinellus). In July and August 2010, dozens of people contracted rhabdomyolysis after eating Procambarus clarkii in Nanjing, China. A month later, the Chinese authorities claimed they were victims of Haff disease. An outbreak was reported in Brooklyn, New York on 18 November 2011, when two household members were stricken by the syndrome after eating buffalo fish.https://a816- health29ssl.nyc.gov/sites/NYCHAN/Lists/AlertUpdateAdvisoryDocuments/2011%20DOHMH%20Haff%20Disease%20advisory.pdf (sign in may be required) On February 4, 2014 two cases of Haff disease were reported in Cook County, Illinois following the consumption of buffalo fish. A group from Brazil identified a Haff disease outbreak in the State of Bahia that lasted from December 2016 to April 2017,FIOCRUZ, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (in Portuguese), \\"Estudo descreve surto de enfermidade conhecida como “doença da urina preta” em Salvador\\"; 28 July 2017, https://portal.fiocruz.br/noticia/estudo-descreve-surto-de-enfermidade- conhecida-como-doenca-da-urina-preta-em-salvador with 67 cases identified. In August 2018, a couple from São Paulo, southeastern Brazil, fell ill and needed semi-intensive hospital care after eating fish of the species known in Portuguese as \\"arabaiana\\" or \\"olho-de-boi\\" (ox-eye), possibly the southern yellowtail amberjack, Seriola lalandi, which they had bought in the city of Fortaleza, State of Ceará, northeastern Brazil, and, according to them, looked \\"perfect\\". The day following their admission to hospital the patients already presented an alteration of their urine, which, according to the woman who fell ill, \\"was very dark, indeed looked like Coca-Cola\\".Folha de S. Paulo (in Portuguese), \\"Carne de peixe contaminada provoca doença rara em casal de São Paulo\\", 04 October 2018; https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2018/10/carne-de-peixe- contaminada-provoca-doenca-rara-em-casal-de-sao-paulo.shtml =Poison= The exact nature of the poison is still unclear. In the U.S. outbreak, the source of the fish was traced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and studies of other fish from the same sources showed a hexane-soluble (and hence non-polar lipid) substance that induced similar symptoms in mice; other food- borne poisons commonly found in fish could not be detected. It cannot be inactivated by cooking, as all six CDC cases had consumed cooked or fried fish. Palytoxin has been proposed as a disease model. It has also been suggested that the toxin may have thiaminase activity (i.e. it degrades thiamine, also known as vitamin B1). References Secondary sources * Jürgen W.

The academy's principal is Andrew Fowler who began his headship in June 2019. It was most recently inspected by Ofsted in February 2017 where it was assigned a 'Requires Improvement' grading (or 3/5 stars) in all areas of the framework with the exception of 16-19 study programmes.https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection- report/provider/ELS/137942  Jack Lawson  The school is named after Jack Lawson, an influential British trade unionist and Labour politician, serving as Secretary of State for War during the 1940s. Consequently, the school has been associated with left-wing politics, particularly relating to its connections to the mining industry and trade unionism, as well as Lawson's refusal to join Ramsay MacDonald's National Government due to his reluctance to work alongside Conservatives. The school motto, \\"each other...and our dreams\\", is a quotation from Lawson's autobiography, A Man's Life.  Subjects and courses  Between year 7–9 students study a range non-optional subjects including, but not limited to: English, Mathematics, Science, History, IT, Geography, French, German and Art. In year 10 students are given the opportunity to drop certain subjects and take on new subjects e.g. Psychology, whilst core-subjects such as Maths and English are still mandatory requirements. In Sixth Form students are given the chance to study between 3 and 5 subjects which include ECDL courses.  School houses  The school is broken up into four house-blocks for years 7–11. Named after prominent areas in the North East, they are all assigned a colour and community space. Each house-block is led by a Head of House and a Deputy Head of House, with students selecting their own Head Boy, Head Girl and Prefects. The house- blocks are: *Brookside (Blue) *Fleet (Yellow) *Talbot (Red) *Turner [formerly Grove] (Green) *Sixth Form (Purple)  Sixth form  The sixth form is led by a Head of Sixth Form, Mrs. Jordan and a Director of Post-15 Education, Miss. Nellist. Mrs. Jordan and Miss. Nellist. Furthermore, there are student- assigned Head Boy/Girl positions as well as a student council. Ofsted noted in their most recent report that “The effectiveness of the Sixth Form is good and the vast majority of students go onto higher education, training, or employment.” They also reported that “Students are well known and the courses they take are well matched to their needs.” The sixth form was given a grade 'good' whilst the main school achieved a rating of 'requires improvement' At the end of Year 13, a leaver's ball is usually held at Lumley Castle, attended by both pupils and staff. New academy extension An extension to Lord Lawson was completed in April 2014. It includes an independent learning centre, designed for sixth form students. The construction was carried out by Sir Robert McAlpine and Pinnacle Schools. The extension is expected to accommodate eight further class rooms.

The model suggests that anonymity changes the relative salience of personal vs. social identity, and thereby can have a profound effect on group behavior. The social identity model of deindividuation effects (or SIDE model) is a theory developed in social psychology and communication studies. SIDE explains the effects of anonymity and identifiability on group behavior. It has become one of several theories examining technology that describe social effects of computer- mediated communication. With advancing technology it is becoming increasingly researched what the effects of having the control of being incognito on the web, and also having profiles that represent ones person is doing to relationships and communication in our lives. The SIDE model provides an alternative explanation for effects of anonymity and other \\"deindividuating\\" factors that classic deindividuation theory cannot adequately explain. To understand the model of deindividuation, it is described by scholarly articles as \\"the situation in which individuals act in groups and do not see themselves as individuals, thereby facilitating antinormative behavior\\" . Furthermore, research on social identity model of deindividuation investigates prosocial behavior, prevent social disturbance and prevent child prejudice. It is said that conformity to group norms is a large part of deindividuation when understanding social identity with in it. The model suggests that anonymity changes the relative salience of personal vs. social identity, and thereby can have a profound effect on group behavior. While other studies on this suggest that the identification of self through online groups lessens ones actual idea of personal identity outside of online spaces; concluding that even when personal identity is seemingly salient in online spaces it still further disassociates the person with themselves outside of online communities.  Background  SIDE developed as a critique of deindividuation theory. Deindividuation theory was developed to explain the phenomenon that in crowds, people become capable of acts that rational individuals would not normally endorse (see also Crowd psychology). In the crowd, so it would seem, humans become disinhibited and behave anti-normatively. Early versions of deindividuation theory saw this as a consequence of reduced self-awareness and accountability. Diener and others later focused more exclusively on loss of self as the core psychological process underlying deindividuation. ReicherReicher, S.D. (1982) The determination of collective behaviour. In Tajfel (Ed.) Social Identity and Intergroup Relations Cambridge, CUP, and Paris, Maison des Sciences de l'Homme. criticized deindividuation theory for several reasons. Among others, historical evidence and case studies strongly suggested that the psychological process proposed by deindividuation theory (a loss of self) did not occur in the crowd.McPhail, C. (1991). The myth of the madding crowd. New York: de Gruyter. A meta-analysis of empirical deindividuation research confirmed there was no consistent empirical evidence for the processes it proposed.Postmes, T., & Spears, R. (1998). Deindividuation and anti-normative behavior: A meta-analysis. Psychological Bulletin, 123, 238–259. To the contrary: anonymity and reduced self-awareness enhanced sensitivity to local norms. SIDE researchers concluded that there is no good empirical support for the process of deindividuation, and factors that should produce deindividuation have highly variable effects on behavior.Reicher, S., Spears, R., & Postmes, T. (1995). A social identity model of deindividuation phenomena. European Review of Social Psychology, 6, 161–198. To account for this, SIDE proposes that there are no blanket indiscriminate effects of anonymity, but that anonymity effects are influenced by, and can only be understood through, their interaction with the social context. ReicherReicher, S. (1987). Crowd behaviour as social action. In J. C. Turner, M. A. Hogg, P. J. Oakes, S. Reicher & M. S. Wetherell (Eds.), Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory (pp. 171–202). Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell. also challenged the conceptualization of deindividuation as a loss of self. This process assumes that individuals have a unitary self-concept that they can be more or less aware of. Reicher and others argued that individuals do not have a unitary sense of self. Social identity theory, for instance, points out that one's sense of self is made up of personal identity and multiple social identities, all of which combine to shape one's personality. Social identities are likely to become the basis for self-definition when that social identity is salient, such as when making comparisons between \\"them\\" and \\"us\\". One consequence of salience is \\"depersonalization\\". Note that in research on social identity, depersonalization is not the same as deindividuation or a loss of self (cf. the entry on Depersonalization to read up on what it is not). In social identity research, the term depersonalization refers to a switch to a group level of self-categorization in which self and others are seen in terms of their group identities. According to self-categorization theory,Turner, J. C., Hogg, M. A., Oakes, P. J., Reicher, S., & Wetherell, M. S. (1987). Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory. Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell. depersonalization makes perceptions of the outgroup more stereotypical. Self-perceptions also shift: self and other ingroup members become interchangeable, and the individual self-stereotypes in terms of group attributes. Depersonalization thus transforms individuals into group members who regulate their behavior according to in-group norms. Importantly, and in contrast to deindividuation, the psychological state of depersonalization does not imply a loss of rationality or behavioural disinhibition; rather, the individual behaves rationally and regulates behaviour according to ingroup standards. These ideas from social identity theory and self-categorization theory provided not only key ingredients for Reicher's critique of deindividuation theory, they are also the foundations upon which SIDE was modelled. Deindividuation is basically when one person does not think of themselves as an individual being, but rather as a group or more than one being. This does not necessarily mean bad or inappropriate behavior. This means that the group norms are changed. There has been recent studies on the SIDE model may put an end to racism in growing children, as well as social awkwardness. With fresh minds and our growing world of technology, the SIDE model is becoming a more researched topic. The SIDE model tells us that people change their behavior when introduced into groups. For example, when one person engages in an activity, such as a party or social event they change their behavior. They become less individualized and unique and merge themselves with surrounding people to become almost one person. They can act and do things as one group.  Development  The model was first named by Lea and SpearsLea, M., & Spears, R. (1991). Computer-mediated communication, de- individuation and group decision-making. International Journal of Man Machine Studies, 34, 283–301. and later developed in a series of publications.Lea, M., & Spears R. (1992). Paralanguage and social perception in computer-mediated communication. Journal of Organizational Computing, 2, 321–341.Postmes, T., Spears, R., & Lea, M. (1998). Breaching or building social boundaries? SIDE- effects of computer-mediated communication. Communication Research, 25, 689–715.Spears, R., & Lea, M. (1994). Panacea or panopticon? The hidden power in computer-mediated communication. Communication Research, 21, 427–459. The SIDE model took Reicher's ideas about the crowd, and applied and extended them to computer-mediated communication. Early research in this domain suggested that, similar to deindividuation theory, users of online computer were prone to flaming and other disinhibitions due to a reduction in social cues.Kiesler, S., Siegel, J., & McGuire, T. W. (1984). Social psychological aspects of computer-mediated communication. American Psychologist, 39, 1123–1134. The SIDE model was developed, in first instance, to account for contradictory effects of social cues in online groups. SIDE thus assumed that effects in the crowd and in online environments showed some similar properties. The first comprehensive statement of SIDE was by Reicher, Spears, & Postmes. According to SIDE, a social identity approach can account for many of the effects observed in deindividuation research and in crowd psychology, as well as in computer-mediated communication. For example, deindividuation has been found to foster group identification and to induce greater opinion polarization in small groups communicating online. In order to understand effects of factors such as anonymity and reduced cues on group behavior, one needs to take the social and inter-group context into account. SIDE argues that anonymity and social context in interaction have cognitive and strategic consequences.  Cognitive SIDE  Group immersion and anonymity have cognitive consequences that affect the relative salience of personal and social identities. These factors do not produce a loss of self as proposed by deindividuation theory. Rather, anonymity and immersion in the group can enhance the salience of social identity and thereby depersonalize social perceptions of others and the self. SIDE argues this occurs principally because (visual) anonymity obscures individual features and interpersonal differences. As a result of the decreased visibility of the individual within anonymous groups, the process of depersonalization is accentuated, and cognitive efforts to perceive the group as an entity are amplified. Provided that there is some basis to perceive self and others as members of one group, anonymity therefore enhances the salience of the shared social identity. The net result is that people will tend to perceive self and others in terms of stereotypic group features, and are influenced accordingly. It is important to note that anonymity does not automatically or mechanically influence the salience of social identities. An individual can be identified in such a way that it promotes a more individuated person-perception or alternatively that it promotes a stronger social categorization. In a few instances, making the individual more identifiable may strengthen social categorization. This may happen particularly in contexts within which these social categories are potentially meaningful and therefore accessible, and when group memberships are visually clearly identifiable (as is the case for gender, certain racial characteristics, disabilities, etc.Spears, R., Postmes, T., Lea, M., & Wolbert, A. (2002). The power of influence and the influence of power in virtual groups: A SIDE look at CMC and the Internet. The Journal of Social Issues, 58, 91–108.). SIDE thus describes the cognitive process by which the salience of social identity is affected by the absence or presence of individuating information. It is important to note that this process can only operate to the extent that some sense of groupness exists from the outset. If individuals interact anonymously in the absence of any specific social identity or group boundaries, anonymity would have the reverse effect of accentuating one’s isolation from the group or by further obscuring group boundaries.Postmes, T., Spears, R., Sakhel, K., & De Groot, D. (2001). Social influence in computer-mediated communication: The effects of anonymity on group behavior. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 27, 1242–1254. Juxtaposing the two possibilities, anonymity in the group either has the effect of amplifying a shared social identity that, however rudimentary, is already in place, or it can amplify the individual independence which exists in contexts in which no shared identity is available. The latter process, whereby anonymity provides the opportunities for people to express and develop identities independent of the social influence of the group, is further elaborated in the Strategic SIDE.  Strategic SIDE  Anonymity also has strategic consequences: it affects the ability to express personal and social identities. Strategic concerns come into play when an out-group has more power than the ingroup, and where the norms of both groups are at odds with each other. In such cases, the identifiability of ingroup members towards the outgroup will shift the power balance between groups: identifiability towards a more powerful outgroup limits the degree to which the ingroup's identity can be expressed freely and without sanction on those dimensions where ingroup norms conflict with out-group standards and values, and which are punishable or otherwise sanctionable. Conversely, anonymity towards a more powerful outgroup may be a convenient instrument for the ingroup to express itself on those same dimensions. The strategic SIDE thus proposes that anonymity may be \\"used\\" by less powerful groups to express aspects of their identity. This may appear to be similar to the effects that anonymity has for accountability in classic deindividuation theory. However, unlike deindividuation theory, SIDE takes account of the inter-group context within which identifiability and anonymity occur. By implication, a loss of accountability does not result in the disinhibited or random anti-normative behaviour of individuals that deindividuation theory is concerned with. Rather, according to SIDE, anonymity affects the ability for a group to express its identity, and thus to engage in targeted and ingroup normative behaviour, thereby changing power relations between groups. The close connection between identity expression and power proposed by SIDE may explain the patterned and targeted behaviour of crowds whose violent actions (if they occur) are very often symbolic, not random. In addition to anonymity between groups, SIDE also considers strategic effects of anonymity within groups. Here, SIDE has particularly explored the consequences of anonymity (as well as isolation) from other ingroup members: On the one hand this deprives individual group members of social support from their fellows, and this may hinder their ability to express their ingroup identity in the face of a powerful and unsympathetic outgroup. On the other hand, the knowledge that other ingroup members are unable to identify the self may have consequences for (in particular) low identifiers to feel less committed to ingroup norms. Applications Today, SIDE is used to explain the effects of anonymity and social isolation in various contexts. Research on SIDE has particularly focused on crowds and collective action,Chan, M. (2010). The impact of email on collective action: A field application of the SIDE model. New Media & Society, 12(8), 1313-1330. on online teams,Lea, M., Rogers, P., & Postmes, T. (2002).

Social information processing theory explains online interpersonal communication without nonverbal cues and how people develop and manage relationships in a computer-mediated environment. While the term has traditionally referred to those communications that occur via computer- mediated formats (e.g., instant messages, e-mails, chat rooms), it has also been applied to other forms of text-based interaction such as text messaging.Thurlow, C., Lengel, L. & Tomic, A. (2004). Computer mediated communication: Social interaction and the internet. London: Sage. In computer- mediated environments, interpersonal relationship development may require more time to develop than traditional face-to-face (FtF) relationships. Social information processing theory argues that online interpersonal relationships may demonstrate the same relational dimensions and qualities as FtF relationships. These online relationships may help facilitate interactions that would not have occurred face-to-face due to factors such as geography and intergroup anxiety. Overview = Origins = At the start of the 1990s, after the advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web, interest grew in studying how the Internet impacted the ways people communicate with each other. Joseph Walther, a communication and media theorist, said that computer- mediated communication (CMC) users can adapt to this restricted medium and use it effectively to develop close relationships. Walther understood that to describe the new nature of online communication required a new theory. Social information processing theory focuses on the social processes that occur when two or more people are engaged in communication, similar to theories such as social presence theory, social penetration theory, and uncertainty reduction theory. What makes SIP different from these theories is its distinct focus on communication mediated solely by information and communications technologies. While other media theories exist, such as media richness theory and uses and gratifications theory, SIP specifically focuses on relationships entirely mediated online. This theory takes influence from the theory of managerial media selection, originally titled Social Information Processing Theory by Salancik and Pfeffer (1978). They state that a manager's perception of organization is attributed to the social information that is generated by a coworker in relation to the manager. This variation of the theory is well before the time of CMC and social media, to it emphasized real life qualities on how managers perceive reflections of others. This was later applied to the richness of email when that became available in the late 1980s. The latter part of this later became known as social influence theory of CMC. = The cues filtered-out theories = Unlike some theories that are rooted in other theoretical perspectives from various fields of study, SIP was conceptualized, in part, by addressing the shortcomings of other theories that addressed communication mediums. These theories are termed cues filtered-out theories. Cues filtered-out theories refer to theories that address the lack of nonverbal cues as being detrimental to online relationship development. Walther's research critiqued past methodological and conceptual problems with theoretical thinking. He subsequently worked toward establishing an interpersonal communication theory that more accurately reflected the intersection among communication, online environments, the self and relationships. Two of those theoretical perspective that influenced Walther's theory are social presence theory and media richness theory. Walther believes that both SPS and MRT suffer from a limited understanding of relational life online. He argues that if interactants communicate enough times and with sufficient breadth and depth, nonverbal communication does not remain paramount in relationship development. = Forms of Self = One of the most important aspects of online interaction is the presentation of Self. Tory Higgins (1987) described three main forms of self: actual self, ideal self, and ought self. Actual self is the set of qualities and characteristics that person actually possesses, the ideal self contains the attributes that a person hopes to someday achieve, and the ought self contains the attributes that a person believes he/she should possess. Carl Rogers (1951) posited that there was another form of self, one that is not concerned with the future like the ideal and ought self. He called it the true self: a present form of self that exists psychologically and is not always fully expressed within social settings like the actual self. Bargh, McKenna, and Fitzsimons (2002) conducted an experiment to test how the actual self and true self are expressed by people in face-to-face and computer-mediated interactions, and found that the actual self was more accessible following an initial face-to-face interaction, while the true self was more accessible following an initial interaction online. From the results of their study, the researchers concluded that people tend to like each other better when they meet online instead of meeting face- to-face. = Assumptions = Social information processing researchers like Joseph Walther are intrigued by how identities are managed online and how relationships are able to move from one of superficiality to one of intimacy. Three assumptions related to the SIP theory are listed below: * Computer- mediated communication provides unique opportunities to connect with people. The first assumption rests on the premise that computer-mediated communication is a unique opportunity to build interpersonal relationships with others. The CMC systems are vast and almost always text based. It has been identified as \\"an organic setting\\" and it can be both synchronous and asynchronous. CMC is clearly different than face-to-face communication, but it offers an unparalleled opportunity to meet someone whom you would never meet FtF. Moreover, relationships established via CMC systems also prompt emotions and feelings we find in all relationships. Finally, since CMC systems are available around the globe, the uniqueness of being able to cultivate online relationships with someone who is very far away cannot be ignored. * Online communicators are motivated to form (favorable) impressions of themselves to others. The second assumption alludes that impression management is essential in online relationships and participants undertake efforts to ensure particular impressions. Researchers have found that social networking sites (SNS) like Facebook are filled with people who wish to provide a number of different self-presentations to others. Thus, how others present and manage themselves online remains important on various SNS and on numerous CMC system platforms. * Online interpersonal relationships require extended time and more accumulated messages to develop equivalent levels of intimacy seen in FtF interpersonal relationships. The third assumption of SIP states that different rates of information exchange and information accrual affect relationship development. Social information processing theory is suggesting that although the messages are verbal, communicators \\"adapt\\" to the restrictions of online medium, look for cues in the messages from others, and modify their language to the extent that the words compensate for the lack of nonverbal cues. This third assumption reflects Walther's contention that given sufficient time and accrual of messages, online relationships have the same capacity to become intimate as those that are established face to face. In addition, online comments are usually delivered rather quickly and efficiently. Further, these messages \\"build up\\" over time and provide online participants sufficient information from which to begin and develop interpersonal relationships.  Key concepts and features  = Hyperpersonal perspective =  Three phases of CMC  Social information processing theory describes computer- mediated communication as a process including three phases: impersonal, to interpersonal, and finally to hyperpersonal. In the impersonal phase, due to the lack of nonverbal cues, CMC is believed to be more task-oriented than traditional face-to-face communication. Since the content is not influenced by social and emotional influence, it can avoid overly personal interpersonal interaction, promote rationality by providing essential discipline, facilitate the efficiency of group work through getting rid of peer pressure and hierarchy, and ultimately, create a more \\"democratic\\" atmosphere within organizations. In the interpersonal phase, the nonverbal cues are lean and as the communication time increases, the exchange of social information increases accordingly. The anticipation of future communication may make communicators to look for more information about the other. This mechanism leads to similar immediacy, similarity, composure, and receptivity as in FtF communication. In the hyperpersonal phase, The sender uses the process of selective self- presentation. People who meet online have a better opportunity to make a favorable impression on the other. This is because the communicators can decide which information they would like to share about themselves by controlling their self-presentations online, giving them the power to disclose only their good traits. SIP has, at its core, impression management. Communication Scholars define impression management as either a strategic or unconscious effort to influence another's perception. Much of the earlier research on impression management focused on FtF communication and the nuances with meeting someone. A person's self-image was viewed as important in relational development. Later applications of impression management were undertaken once online communication began. Selective-Presentation is not as likely to occur in FtF communication due to the ability to observe all the obvious traits in person. The receivers may idealize the senders based on making attributions from available paralingual cues found in the message. This process is enhanced with asynchronous exchanges, letting both sender and receiver have ample time to consider the messages sent and received. In the absence of FtF contextual cues, the likelihood of over-attributing given information of the sender is increased, often creating an idealized image of the message sender. For example, over-attribution is also found in online dating. While reading a perspective date's profile, the reader is likely to see themselves as similar to one another and therefore become more interested than they originally would have been. Finally, the feedback process addresses the reciprocal influence of the senders and the receivers. They develop impressions and intimacy as a result of their interaction.  Four elements of hyperpersonal model  The hyperpersonal perspective is more than saying that an online relationship is intimate. Walther, in a number of different scholarly venues, articulated its complexity and some other scholars elucidate the four components he studied: senders; receivers; channel; and feedback. These four also constitute many of the models of communication. * Sender: Selective Self-Presentation According to Walther, senders have the ability to present themselves in highly strategic and highly positive ways. This self- presentation is controlled and it serves as a foundation for how CMC users get to know one another. The fundamental underpinning of this component of the hyperpersonal perspective is affinity seeking. That is, senders provide information online that prompts affinity in others. * Receiver: Idealization of the Sender At the core of this component in the hyperpersonal perspective is attribution. Attributions are those evaluations and judgements we make based on the actions or behaviors of others. The receiver tends to attribute and, according to the theory, the receiver may \\"overattribute\\", which means that a receiver is likely to think that a sender has more similarities than differences. Further, a receiver may experience an overreliance on the minimal cues available online and forget that the relationship he or she has with a sender is based on words. * Channel Management The asynchronous nature of CMC allows online participants to think about texts or emails before sending them. Further, prior to sending messages, you can rewrite them for clarity, sense, and relevancy. Online asynchronous experiences allow for \\"optimal and desirable\\" communication, ensuring that the messages are of high quality. Walther contends that the more relational the affection or more desirable the other communicator is, the more editing in message composition. * Feedback Walther interprets feedback as behavioral confirmation, which is a \\"reciprocal influence that partners exert\\". In communication theory, we refer to this as self-fulfilling prophecy. This prophecy essentially is a tendency for an individual's expectation of a target person to evoke a response from that person which, in turn, reaffirms the original prediction. Walther's hyperpersonal perspective acknowledges a feedback system this way: \\"When a receiver gets a selectively self-presented message and idealizes its source, that individual may respond in a way that reciprocates and reinforces the partially modified personae, reproducing, enhancing, and potentially exaggerating them\\". Because cues in an online environment are limited, the feedback that does occur is often exaggerated or magnified. The four components—sender, receiver, channel, and feedback—suggest that the hyperpersonal perspective is a process which is ongoing and dynamic. Walther concludes that SIP is a \\"process\\" theory because both information and interpersonal meaning is accumulated over time, providing online partners an opportunity to establish a relationship.  Experiments  Two researches were carried out by Walther and his colleagues from 1992 to 1994, focusing on the channel management of the computer-mediated communication. Summary of the two experiments are as follows. Around the time in 1992 when Walther produced and published the Social Information Processing theory, he and his colleagues conducted an experiment, examining the effects of time and communication channel—asynchronous computer conferencing versus face-to-face meetings—on relational communication in groups. Prior research on the relational aspects of computer-mediated communication has suggested strong depersonalizing effects of the medium due to the absence of nonverbal cues. Past research is criticized for failing to incorporate temporal and developmental perspectives on information processing and relational development. In this study, data were collected from 96 subjects assigned to computer conferencing or face-to-face zero-history groups of 3, who completed three tasks over several weeks' time. Results showed that computer-mediated groups increased in several relational dimensions to more positive levels and that these subsequent levels approximated those of face-to-face groups. Boundaries on the predominant theories of computer-mediated communication are recommended, and principles from uncertainty reduction and social penetration are discussed. Later, Walther and his colleagues did follow-up research. Previous research on the interpersonal tone of computer-mediated communication shows different effects using longitudinal computer-mediated groups than are found in research using one-shot groups, even before the developmental aspects associated with time can accrue. One factor distinguishing these approaches is the anticipation of future interaction experienced by longitudinal groups. This research reports an experiment assessing the relative effects of anticipated future interaction and different communication media (computer-mediated versus face-to-face communication) on the communication of relational intimacy and composure. Asynchronous and synchronous computer conferencing and face-to-face groups were examined. Results show that the assignment of long-term versus short-term partnerships has a larger impact on anticipated future interaction reported by computer-mediated, rather than face-to-face, partners. Evidence also shows that anticipation is a more potent predictor of several relational communication dimensions than is communication condition. Implications for theory and practice are identified.  Evaluation of SIP: Intimacy  Several theorists have explored the differences in intimacy developed through CMC versus face-to-face communication. Walther is convinced that the length of time that CMC users have to send their messages is the key factor that determines whether their messages can achieve the same level of intimacy that others develop face-to-face. Over an extended period the issue is not the amount of social information that can be conveyed online; rather, it is the rate at which the information builds up. Any message spoken in person will take at least four times longer to communicate through CMC. When comparing 10 minutes of face-to-face conversation with 40 minutes of CMC, there was no difference in partner affinity between the two modes. Anticipated future interaction is a way of extending physiological time, which gives the likelihood of future interaction and motivates CMC users to develop a relationship. Relational messages provide interactants with information about the nature of the relationship, the interactants' status in the relationship, and the social context within which the interaction occurs. The \\"shadow of the future\\" motivates people to encounter others on a more personal level. A chronemic cue is a type of nonverbal cue not filtered out of CMC and indicates how one perceives, uses, or responds to issues of time. Unlike tone of voice, interpersonal distance, or gestures, times is the one nonverbal cue that cannot be filtered out of CMC. For example, a person can send a text message at a certain time of the day and when a response is received he or she can gauge how much time elapsed between messages. Social information processing theory says that a prompt reply signals deference and liking in a new relationship or business context. A delayed response may indicate receptivity and more liking in an intimate relationship; partners who are comfortable with each other do not need to reply as quickly.GRIFFIN, E. M. (2009). A first look at communication theory. (seventh ed., p. 486). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Meanwhile, Walther, with his colleagues, conducted another investigation which examined how computer-mediated communication (CMC) partners exchange personal information in initial interactions, focusing on the effects of communication channels on self-disclosure, question-asking, and uncertainty reduction. Unacquainted individuals (N = 158) met either face-to- face or via CMC. Computer-mediated interactants exhibited a greater proportion of more direct and intimate uncertainty reduction behaviors than unmediated participants did, and demonstrated significantly greater gains in attributional confidence over the course of the conversations. The use of direct strategies by mediated interactants resulted in judgments of greater conversational effectiveness by partners. Others, such as Dr. Kevin B. Wright, examined the difference in developing and maintaining relationships both exclusively and primarily online. Specifically, Wright has found the effectiveness of \\"openness and positivity\\" in online communication versus avoidance in offline relationships. = Warranting =  Origin  Walther and Parks noticed that people often meet offline after having first met online. Sometimes these experiences are positive, and other times negative. They are dissatisfied with existing theories' ability to explain these phenomena. To fill in the theoretical gap, Walther and Parks adopt the original concept of warranting presented by Stone, describing connections between one's self and self-presentation as a continuum rather than a binary, moderated by anonymity. They suggested that the potential for anonymity resulted in the potential for a discrepancy along this continuum. The greater this potential discrepancy, the more compelling it is for observers to be skeptical of information provided by the individual about the self. Warrants, as described by Walther and Parks, are perceived reliable cues that observers use to gauge how one's true identity matches that which is presented online. According to Walther, \\"Warranting pertains to the perceived legitimacy and validity of information about another person that one may receive or observe online.\\"Walther, Joseph B., and Eun-Ju Lee. \\"23. Computer-mediated Communication.\\" Interpersonal Communication (2014): n. pag. Web Over the years, individuals have come to learn a lot about each other through online discussion groups or online role-playing games. Many have also started to gain an understanding of another person through \\"personal homepages and other forms of online interaction and self-presentation, including online dating sites.\\" However, with the introduction of many online social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, there are many opportunities for people to interact using CMC. As such, there are many factors – photographs, videos, and the ability to build your own profile – that set social media apart from the text-only CMC that Walther originally studied. For example, if a person describes him or herself as a quiet, reserved person but friends add pictures of him or her out at a bar with a large group of people. These two ideas contradict each other. How the person processes this contradiction is the main idea of Walther's warranting theory. \\"If the information we're reading has warranting value, then it gives us reason to believe it is true.\\" This value is defined as the extent to which the cue is perceived to be unaltered by the target. Warrants that are very difficult to manipulate by the user are considered high in warranting value. They are more likely to be accepted as truth. An example of this is information added to your profile by others because the owner cannot easily change it (Others-generated warrants). Partial warranting is another example. It is information that, though provided by the user, contains easily verifiable facts. The numerical information, such as height, weight, age, or address constitutes as partial warranting, as these figures are easily checked and provide little room for gray area. Low warrant information is easily manipulated and therefore less believable. It is much more questionable in terms of accuracy (Walther & Parks, 2002). An example of this is information self-reported on personal profile pages. These can range from interests and hobbies, to other personal details (also known as constraining information, which is not easily verified but restricts identity).  Experiment  Walther, Van Der Heide, Kim, Westerman, and Tong (2008), wanted to explore if the attractiveness of friends, as well as what these friends said on an individual's profile, had an effect on social attraction. They investigated the topic by assigning random participants to view fake Facebook pages. This experiment had two phases. In the first phase, researchers displayed two comments from friends of a profile with neutral content. The small profile pictures of commenting friends were either attractive or unattractive, and the comments suggested either socially desirable or socially undesirable behaviors. It was found that social attractiveness was positively correlated with the physical attractiveness of commenting friends (Walther et al., 2008). This indicates that the simple observable presence of others in one's social network may be enough to make social judgments. In the second phase, researchers tested the effects of self- generated information against information generated by others. Walther et al. (2009) compared subjects reactions to fake Facebook profiles and their judgments of extroversion and introversion. Profiles contained either self- generated information suggesting the profile owner was introverted or extroverted, and others-generated statements suggesting the owner was introverted or extroverted. Information suggesting introversion was considered negative while information suggestion extroversion was considered to be positive. Walther et al. (2009) found that while others-generated statements do indeed have an effect on observer judgments, the effect did not override self-generated information or negativity effects. His experiments confirmed that people value high warrant information. It found that credibility levels and attractiveness were swayed by comments made on the profile by people other than its owner. It also confirmed his beliefs by comparing high and low warrant information and finding that friends' remarks were valued higher than the owner's claims in regards to physical attractiveness and outgoingness. These studies have found that, unlike email, communication comes from both the owner and other users of social media and viewers do not give these two opinions equal value. = Synchronous and asynchronous communication = Synchronous communication refers to interactions that occur in real-time, where participants in a conversation are actively communicating while online at the same time. Examples of online synchronous communication would be text messages and other instant messaging platforms, as well as internet telephony, such as FaceTime and Skype. Asynchronous communication, on the other hand, occurs when conversation participants are not online at the same time, and messages are left for the other to receive. Examples of online asynchronous communication include voicemails, emails, blogs, and social media sites. A 2011 study in Finland suggested that it is synchronicity, not online social use in general, that separates generations in the Digital Age. The study collected data from a survey of over 600 people, ranging from age 15–65, and categorized its participants by 3 distinct generations: Digital Immigrants, or DI (born before 1989); the First Digital Generation, and 1DG (born between 1980–1989, who were exposed to early digital technologies at a relatively young age), and the Second Digital Generation, or 2DG (born after 1990, who mostly grew up with digital technologies). A survey revealed multiple differences in online communication methods between 1DG and 2DG. First, 75% of 1DG reported using online blogs (an asynchronous method), while 59% of 2DG reported using it. Also, 48% of 1DG reported using instant messaging (a synchronous method), while 77% of 2DG reported using it. Of the other 3 online methods tested (internet calls, social networking sites, and discussion forums), 2DG had the highest usage rate of the three generations. DI had significantly lower results for each method except internet calls, which was within 12% across all 3 generations. This data reveals that everyone is using the internet for social purposes, but that younger generations of the Digital Age prefer synchronous communication methods, while older generations tend to use asynchronous communication more often. Burgoon, Chen, and Twitchell (2010) also conducted an experiment to test how synchronicity affects online interactions. They had their participants conduct team-oriented tasks, and used different methods of communication to observe how people perceived their fellow team members. They proposed that synchronicity affects interactivity, and the results of the experiment supported their hypothesis. They observed that synchronous forms of communications allow for increased mental and behavioral engagement between parties, allowing participants to feel a stronger sense of connection, presence, identification, and social awareness in the conversation. Research and applications Social information processing theory has been used to study online relationships in a variety of contexts. Since the late 1990s, the Internet has increased the amount of totally-mediated interactions making the possibility of developing and sustaining an entire relationships online more possible. = Application in online dating = Some early studies looked at e-mail discussion groups while more contemporary research has found a great deal attention placed on social media networks such as Facebook and online dating sites. These situations are significant to observing SIP and the hyperpersonal perspective in action. In relation to romantic relationships, several studies and subsequent theories have stemmed from SIP, combining it with theories such as Social Penetration Theory (SPT) or Relational Dialectics to further examine how modern day relationships are formed and sustained. Scholars Nicole Ellison, Rebecca Heino, and Jennifer Gibbs conducted such a study and formed their own theory in their article Managing Impressions Online: Self-Presentation Processes in the Online Dating Environment which utilized both SIP and SPT to examine the development of modern relationships from online acquaintances to intimate partners. Scholars James Farrer and Jeff Gavin from Sophia University in Japan examined the online dating process and dating relationship development to test the SIP theory. This study examines the experiences of past and present members of a popular Japanese online dating site in order to explore the extent to which Western-based theories of computer-mediated communication and the development of online relationships are relevant to the Japanese online dating experience. Specifically, their study examines whether social information processing theory is applicable to Japanese online dating interactions, and how and to what extent Japanese daters overcome the limitations of CMC through the use of contextual and other cues. Thirty-six current members and 27 former members of Match.com Japan completed an online survey. Using issue-based procedures for grounded theory analysis, they found strong support for SIP. Japanese online daters adapt their efforts to present and acquire social information using the cues that the online dating platform provides, although many of these cues are specific to Japanese social context. In 2011, scholar Daria Heinemann analyzed the effects of SIP in the 1998 movie You've Got Mail, and developed an activity to foster the teaching of SIP to students. Throughout the You've Got Mail movie, the two main characters virtually meet in an online chat room, and end up falling in love throughout all of their communication, which leads them to adapt their communication style and presentation in real life. For this activity, Daria suggests watching two specific scenes, 2 and 21, and comparing and contrasting them to see the implication and representation of SIP. Following the viewing of these two scenes, she suggests some debriefing questions to be able to further understand and analyze SIP in the context of this movie. These two specific scenes focus on the introduction of the online relationship between the two characters, and also demonstrate the hyperpersonal perspective of this theory. As well as online dating, SIP can additionally be related to detachment and extramarital attachment unconsciously, which is an area that Zackery A. Carter looked into. Carter claims that casual communications through Facebook have the potential to lead to a more emotional/sexual based relationship regardless of their current status. If people have a long tiring day and utilize Facebook to relax and unwind at the end of the day, they may present themselves in an entirely different way, along with being more open and invoking self- disclosure. Talking to someone online can be an entirely different feeling than talking to someone in person after a long day, which is what Carter was looking to demonstrate with this study. = Application in online marketing = In business contexts, social information processing has been used to study virtual teams as well as the ways viral marketers influence the adoption of products and services through the Internet. Mani R. Subramani and Balaji Rajagopalan pay special attention to the SIP applied to real-world online marketing and promotion activities. The background which stimulate their academic interests is that online social networks are increasingly being recognized as an important source of information influencing the adoption and use of products and services. While the potential of viral marketing to efficiently reach out to a broad set of potential users is attracting considerable attention, the value of this approach is also being questioned. Social information-processing theory provides a useful lens to examine the interpersonal influence processes that are the hallmark of viral marketing since it views the social network as an important source of information and cues for behavior and action for individuals. Prior studies examining the diffusion of innovations and the transmission of ideas in social networks have viewed the interpersonal influence as occurring largely from face-to-face interactions. However, interpersonal influence in viral marketing occurs in computer-mediated settings and is significantly different from that occurring in conventional contexts in several ways. There needs to be a greater understanding of the contexts in which this strategy works and the characteristics of products and services for which it is most effective. What is missing is an analysis of viral marketing that highlights systematic patterns in the nature of knowledge-sharing and persuasion by influencers and responses by recipients in online social networks. To this end, they propose an organizing framework for viral marketing that draws on prior theory and highlights different behavioral mechanisms underlying knowledge-sharing, influence, and compliance in online social networks. = Application in online education = SIP has also been used to study learning in entirely online classes examining the ways that students develop relationships with the instructor and with each other. Dip Nandi, Margaret Hamilton, and James Harland from RMIT University did research on asynchronous discussion forums in fully online courses. Their study focuses on the online discussion process between the students and the instructors, as both senders and receivers, through the CMC channel with the asynchronous nature. Fully online courses are becoming progressively more popular because of their \\"anytime anywhere\\" learning flexibility. One of the ways students interact with each other and with the instructors within fully online learning environments is via asynchronous discussion forums. However, student engagement in online discussion forums does not always take place automatically and there is a lack of clarity about the ideal role of the instructors in them. In their research, Dip Nandi and his colleges report on their research on the quality of discussion in fully online courses through analysis of discussion forum communication. They have conducted the research on two large fully online subjects for computing students over two consecutive semesters and used a grounded theoretic approach for data analysis. The results reveal what students and instructors consider as quality interaction in fully online courses. The researchers also propose two frameworks based on our findings that can be used to ensure effective online interaction. Yonty Friesem discusses the use of SIP within the book 'Emotions, Technology and Behaviors', and more specifically in the chapter titled 'Empathy for the Digital Age: Using Video Production to Enhance Social, Emotional, and Cognitive Skills'. Throughout this chapter, Yonty discusses using filmmaking to assist in learning and teaching in an academic setting. He talks about the richness of the digital media that is present within SIP and how the medium that is used can help people to demonstrate their emotions, which can be amplified through the use of video production as it provides a completely different perspective and format. = Application in child development = SIP has also been used to examine the development of aggressive behavior in children in recent years. Theories of aggressive behavior and ethological observations in animals and children suggest the existence of distinct forms of reactive (hostile) and proactive (instrumental) aggression. Toward the validation of this distinction, groups of reactive aggressive, proactive aggressive, and nonaggressive children were identified. Social information-processing patterns were assessed in these groups by presenting hypothetical vignettes to subjects. Kenneth A. Dodge and Nicki R. Crick from Vanderbilt University did research on the social information bases of aggressive behavior in children. In their study, the ways that basic theories and findings in cognitive and social psychology (including attribution, decision-making, and information- processing theories) have been applied to the study of aggressive behavior problems in children are described. Following an overview of each of these theories, a social information-processing model of children's aggressive behavior is outlined. According to this model, a child's behavioral response to a problematic social stimulus is a function of five: steps of processing: encoding of social cues, interpretation of social cues, response search, response evaluation, and enactment. Skillful processing at each step is hypothesized to lead to competent performance within a situation, whereas biased or deficient processing is hypothesized to lead to deviant social behavior. Empirical studies are described in which children's patterns of processing have been found to predict individual differences in their aggressive behavior. The implications of this body of work for empirically based interventions aimed at reducing children's aggressive behavior are discussed. The reason why some children develop aggressive behavior can be traced back to how these particular children deal with different social cues. Some children participate in something known as social withdrawal meaning that they avoid involvement or are not involved in social or group activities. This is due to either rejection-aggression or rejection-withdrawal. In rejection- aggression, the child is rejected from a peer group due to their aggressive behavior. Rejection-withdrawal is when the child rejects the peer group and separates themselves from them. = Application in leadership = SIP has become more prominent in today's society with the addition of using computers in an online setting to communicate with someone. This is also apparent in the area of leadership and telecommuting. Paul E. Madlock from Texas A&M; International University has conducted a variety of research in organizational communication, where he also implemented the ideas of Walther into some of his work. In his article titled 'The Influence of Supervisors' Leadership Style on Telecommuters' he talks about the most effective style of leadership in today's Digital Age, which is focused on the use of technology. SIP can be related to the style and content of the message, as well as the timing that the message is presented, whether that be synchronously or asynchronously. In this study, Madlock got organizations that utilize telecommuting to fill out a survey because on their job satisfaction and the satisfaction that they feel when leadership is communicated through a computer, whether that be something like Skype, Instant Messaging, cell phones, email and via voice. Employees were able to develop a better connection with their leadership team through telecommuting, if it was task orientated and the information was presented in a realistic format that represented who they were, as opposed to a fake personality. = Application in blogs = Blogs have great potential to display attributes of SIP, as it is purely a non-verbal way of communicating. Yanru Guo and Dion Hoe-Lian Goh conducted a content analysis on posting on microblogs in China, where individuals discussed having an STI, and more specifically having AIDS. They were attempting to display the transformation of messages over time and how intimate relationships were developed through the use of the blog. They compared over 1250 messages at the beginning of their time period to over 900 messages at the end of the time period, to see the difference between the depth of communication each user provided. They found that the level of details shared and intimacy between individuals increased between the two time periods, demonstrating the SIP and how it can be utilized to develop a relationship. = Application in social media = Social Media is a huge platform for SIP to happen, as a lot of people spend a lot of time talking to other individuals via social media. This is predominantly in a personal based setting, but it can additionally be used in other settings such as journalism. Rosie Mi Jahng and Jeremy Littau conducted an experiment on how people gather their information from journalists on social media, specifically related to Twitter. Some of the information that they discussed was the responsiveness of a journalist on their Twitter page, and the information that they provided on their bio page, as that can instantly give a sense of connectedness and reputability. Their study involved around 150 participants looking at a variety of fake Twitter accounts representing journalists who provided different levels of information and news within their tweets. They found out that the more a journalist posted and also responded to people's tweets, the more trust and reputation they built up, increasing the level of connection and relationship present. SIP can also be applied to law enforcement and how they utilize social media strategically to present a good public image. Angela Coonce discusses a variety of different communication theories, including SIP, in her thesis on this topic. SIP provides the option for law enforcement to be able to develop a reputable and healthy relationship with the public in addition to the opinions and structure that they present in a non computer setting. Academic integration While the theory revolves around the basis of interpersonal interaction from a socio-psychological perspective, communication scholars and academics use a positivistic (or empirical) approach to knowing in their study of SIP theory, meaning they rely heavily on numbers and data sets when striving to reach conclusions. Criticisms Despite the fact that social information processing theory offers a more optimistic perspective through which to perceive of and analyze online interactions, the theory is not without its criticisms. Even though Walther proposed that users of computer-mediated communication (CMC) have the same interpersonal needs met as those communicating face-to-face (FtF), he proposed that the lack of visual cues inherent in CMC are disadvantages to be overcome over time.Walther, J. B., & Parks, M. (2002). Cues filtered out, cues filtered in. Handbook of interpersonal communication. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. Thus, more time is needed for interactants to get to know one another, although he maintains that the same intimacy can be reached, just over a longer amount of time. In their research on social cues and impression formation in CMC, Martin Tanis and Tom Postmes found that when initial impressions in CMC are negative, it is questionable and not guaranteed that people will pursue future interaction which negates the idea that more personal and positive relationships will develop over time in CMC relationships. Many of Walther's initial hypotheses relied on the assumption that positive social behaviors would be greater in face-to-face interactions than those in CMC. In a 1995 study, Walther used this hypothesis but added that any initial differences in socialness between the two media would disappear in time.Joinson, Adam. (2003). Understanding the psychology of Internet behavior. Palgrave Macmillan. Walther was surprised to find that his results turned out to be contrary to this prediction. The results showed that, regardless of time-scale, CMC groups were rated higher in most measures of relational communication than those participating in the FtF condition. Robert Tokunaga has presented a cultural value flaw in the SIP theory. An additional support for this claim is that there is research on intercultural communication that suggests the amount of exchange of self-disclosures in CMC is shaped by cultural values. Also, Tokunaga's study found that individualistic cultural values were able to fit inside the SIP theory while collectivist cultural values did not. Some originally argued that the scope of SIP Theory was too broad, since the realm of CMC is so expansive. However, the theory has evolved and been refined over years of research, and has developed more specificity within the discussions of online relationships, such as the topics of warranting and hyperpersonal perspectives. Another area of SIP that has received some criticism relates to its testability. Walther has been a self-reflective critic of his own theory. First, Walther acknowledges that SIP has not fully acknowledged nor clarified the role of the issue of time in CMC relationships. Second, in discussing the hyperpersonal perspective, Walther admits that not all of the theoretical components of his hyperpersonal approach have been researched sufficiently. Third, in examining the warranting hypothesis, Walther, Brandon Van Der Heide, Lauren Hamel, & Hillary Shulman accept the fact that high warranting value may exist on those matters that have strong social desirability. For example, physical attractiveness is a highly desirable trait in the United States, making it socially desirable. So, as Walther accepts, online communicators would seek corroboration for those qualities that society deems important or desirable. Whether or not other less socially desirable qualities are prone to warranting overtures is not fully explained. To summarize, social information processing theory arrived in the communication discipline at the time that the rest of the research world was starting to examine the Internet for its possible influence on interpersonal communication and human relationships. Thus, Joseph Walther is somewhat of a scholarly prophet, forecasting the importance of looking at online relationships in the early 1990s. Although a few criticisms emerge in SIP, people cannot ignore the fact that Walther's theory remains a pivotal framework to consider as we envision future relationship development in an uncertain technological time.  New technologies  The label 'social media' has been attached to a quickly growing number of Web sites whose content is primarily user-driven.Lerman, Kristina. \\"Social Information Processing\\". Google. Retrieved November 2011. These communities are large-scale examples of SIP. Navigating the 'social' world of information online is largely a product of interpersonal connections online, and has prompted the creation of aggregating, or collaborative sources, to help assist collective groups of people sort through information. Learning about others through the concept of \\"seamless sharing\\" opens another word for SIP. Some computer tools that facilitate this process are: * Authoring tools: e.g. blogs * Collaboration tools: e.g. Wikipedia * Social networking: Facebook; Twitter; Instagram; SnapChat * Collaborative filtering: Reddit; the Amazon Products Recommendation System; Yahoo Answer! The process of learning from and connecting with others has not changed, but is instead manifested on the Internet. There are many different opinions regarding the value of social media interactions. These resources allow for people to connect and develop relationships using methods alternative to the traditional FtF-exclusive past, thus, making CMC more prevalent amongst social media users.

Kaspar Brunner (died 1561) was a Swiss mechanic best known for his construction of the clockwork of the Zytglogge, Bern's medieval clock-tower, in 1527–30. Of unknown origins, Brunner is first recorded in 1526 on the occasion of being appointed zitgloggenrichter, or timekeeper of the Zytglogge. After the previous clockwork broke down beyond repair, the city council commissioned Brunner in 1527 to build a new one for the sum of 1.000 gulden. In the following three years, Brunner built the massive mechanism that continues to operate the tower's astronomical clock to this day. After the successful installation of his clockwork, Brunner appears to have risen fast in Bernese society. He was admitted into the Gesellschaft zu Schmieden, the blacksmiths' guild, in 1530, thus fulfilling the prerequisite for holding public office. He was elected Büchsenmeister or arsenal chief in 1537 and married a patrician's daughter, Anna von Graffenried, in 1541. In the same year, he was called to Nuremberg, then the Holy Roman Empire's largest city, where he headed the urban arsenal until his death in 1561. As far as we know, Brunner never built another clockwork. Having worked as locksmith, blacksmith, engineer, gunsmith and clockmaker at various times during his life, Brunner is a characteristic representative of the type of mostly self-taught engineers that emerged at the threshold of the early modern period in Europe and who built most late medieval clockworks. It was not until the second half of the 16th century that watchmaking came to be regarded as a distinct profession.

The hyperpersonal model demonstrates how individuals communicate uniquely, while representing themselves to others, how others interpret them, and how the interactions create a reciprocal spiral of FtF communication. Compared to ordinary FtF situations, a hyperpersonal message sender has a greater ability to strategically develop and edit self-presentation, enabling a selective and optimized presentation of one's self to others. Communication professor Joseph Walther is credited with the development of this theory in 1996, synthesizing his and others' extensive research on computer-mediated communication.  Conditions and Key Components  = Conditions = The hyperpersonal model addresses three questions: 1) when is mediated interaction impersonal; 2) when is CMC interpersonal; and 3) when is CMC hyperpersonal? Hyperpersonal communication, according to Walther, is \\"more socially desirable than we tend to experience in parallel FtF interaction\\" (p. 17). Combinations of media attributes, social phenomena, and social-psychological processes may lead CMC to become \\"hyperpersonal\\", that is, to exceed face-to-face (FtF) communication. This perspective suggests that CMC users may experience greater levels of intimacy, unity and liking within a group or dyad than similar groups or dyads interacting FtF. = Key Components = Senders This component refers to \\"selective self-presentation\\". In CMC, message senders have a greater opportunity to optimize their self-presentation. Walther argues, \\"[CMC participants] were better able to plan, and had increased opportunity to self-censor. With more time for message construction and less stress of ongoing interaction, users may have taken the opportunity to objective self-awareness, reflection, selection and transmission of preferable cues.\\" Message senders use the process of selective self-presentation, which refers to CMC users' ability to manage their online image. Being able to self- censor and manipulate messages is possible to do within a CMC context to a greater extent than in FtF interactions, so individuals have greater control over what cues are sent. Walther point out that asynchronous messages and reduced communication cues contribute to selective self-presentation. In CMC, communicators may inflate attributions about their communication partners. When communication partners are geographically dispersed, individuals are likely to make positive attributions if group salience is high. As a result, members are more likely to make attributions of similarity that lead to greater liking for partners. Paralinguistic cues are used as part of assessing communication partners when using CMC. Selective self-presentation provides an avenue for people to manage their image in a manner that FtF interaction does not. Reduced communication cues and potentially asynchronous communication are both common in CMC. Reduced Cues: CMC reduces cues present in normal FtF interactions. In CMC, first impressions aren't based on physical, and instead rely on information and personality. Senders impressions are more malleable than in an in-person interaction. Walthers cites a study by Chilcoat and DeWine (1985) in which three interpersonal perceptions were examined (attractiveness, attitude similarity, and credibility) against three asynchronous communication vehicles (FtF, videoconferencing, and audioconferencing). One would expect FtF to produce higher ratings for the interpersonal characteristics, but the opposite was true: audioconferencing partners produced higher ratings of their partners' attractiveness, attitude similarity, and credibility than in videoconference or FtF interaction. Receivers This component refers to \\"idealization\\". Walther argues that receivers have an \\"idealized perception\\" of the message sender in CMC. He says that the social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE) predicts that subtle context cues take on a strong value in CMC. The absence of FtF cues leads to the fact that receivers may be very sensitive to any subtle social or personality cues that occur in CMC communication this way, CMC partners build impressions of one another on minimal cues. With fewer cues on which to base their perceptions, receivers have to \\"fill in the gaps\\" of their understanding of the other interactant and often assume more positive characteristics of them. In other words, without FtF cues to mediate the interaction, participants may assume their partner is a \\"better person\\" than they actually are. Asynchronous channel Since CMC doesn't require copresence the way FtF communication does, members can take part in activities at their own convenience, taking advantaged of disentrained communication channels. Walther cites a relaxation of time constraints in CMC, often allowing for an asynchronous mode of communication. For example, with group communication, \\"...Making temporal commitments becomes discretionary. Group members may attend to the group process independently in time. When partners may attend their groups at their convenience, limitations on the amount of partners' mutual time available for meetings are less problematic.\\" Disentrained channels—most often asynchronous communication, via email or forums—gives individuals a way to manage their relationships within groups more efficiently than via FtF. Using asynchronous communication, such as email, individuals are able to manage group relationships in a way that maximizes time spent on group tasks. Through the process of entrainment, people synchronize their activities to meet the requirements of the group's needs, which is constrained by each individuals time and attention. Entrainment can make it difficult for groups to complete tasks together since it requires FtF, and thus synchronous, communication, which may include off-topic discussions that hinder productivity. Asynchronous communication may mitigate entrainment associated with group interaction. According to Walther, asynchronous group interaction may not be constrained by time and/or competing commitments. Group members using asynchronous communication can devote their full attention to the group when they have the opportunity. Greater attention can be spent focusing on tasks related to the group rather than spending time and effort on communication that is irrelevant to the goal. According to Walther, CMC removes temporal limitations, thereby freeing time constraints. \\"Both task- oriented and socially oriented exchanges may take place without one constraining the time available for the other. Feedback processes Walther argues that the behavioral confirmation - \\"reciprocal influence that partners exert\\" in sender-receiver roles — is magnified in minimal-cue interaction like CMC. In other words, in CMC communication, we behave based on the expectation of the other and the social data occurring in communication process is selectively sent and perceived by communicators. Feedback between sender and receiver is a critical part of the communication interaction for relationship development in either FtF or CMC relationships. However, feedback in a minimal-cue environment may be magnified. Behavioral confirmation is the process of communication partners developing impressions and intimacy as a result of interaction. In CMC, behavioral confirmation along with magnification can become idealized, leading CMC partners to develop greater affinity for CMC partners than he or she might develop in a FtF context. This kind of CMC interaction fosters the development of an intensification loop, explaining the hyperpersonal relationships that develop in a cues-limited environment. As the last component of hyperpersonal model, it is conceptualized as reciprocal interaction with others that strengthens one's online performance by bringing together the identity transforming potentials embedded within the other theoretical components.  Foundations of the Model  =FtF vs. CMC= In face-to-face communication, physical features such as appearance, facial expressions, gesture and postures is exposed to others, which can help to convey nonverbal information to help with the communication. Face-to-face communication is formed naturally in emotional, cognitive and physical aspects. Those nonverbal languages are the cues that lack in CMC communication. Some argue that the lack of nonverbal cues in CMC may decrease one's capability of fostering and managing accurate impression on others. Additionally, the lack of nonverbal cues leads to the fact that CMC communication involves less emotional elements than FtF communication does, which contributes to less richness and interpersonal and expressive cues that may provide more positive impression. While other holds the opposite opinions. Walther suggested in his research in 1996 that CMC can actually improve the interpersonal bond between senders and receivers because of the lack of nonverbal cues and demographic messages. Walther argued that nonverbal and demographic cues that occur in FtF communication play a distracting role; while in CMC communication, hyperpersonal interaction is created in which senders pay more attention on the strategy of delivering message so that the self-presentation is enhanced and optimized, which eventually improve the interpersonal interaction. =Social information processing (SIP)= Walther developed an alternate approach to the cues-filtered-out approach. From the social information-processing (SIP) viewpoint, Walther states that people naturally want to develop social relationships. With SIP, the idea of the rate at which social information is exchanged is introduced. Additionally, SIP looks at verbal strategies used in mediated communication. Individuals strategically use language to convey a myriad of information about the sender, enabling the receiver to make attributes about the sender. Yet if CMC really was impersonal, why were so many people adopting CMC for social purposes, such as online gaming, bulletin boards and online chat groups? Walther advanced a different model to explain the growing trend toward the use of CMC for social interaction. When media attributes, social phenomena and social-psychological processes are integrated, the result is what Walther called \\"hyperpersonal.\\" Development of the Model = Three Phases of CMC: Impersonal, Interpersonal, Hyperpersonal = According to Walther's research(1996), the study of CMC went through three phases: from impersonal, to interpersonal, and finally to hyperpersonal. First, because CMC reduces nonverbal communication cues, some argued that CMC was more task-oriented than was FtF. The reasons are: # The concentration on the content of communication will not be distracted by social or emotional influences, so that CMC can \\"promote rationality by providing essential discipline.\\" # CMC is also advantageous in group decision making since it avoids the influence of pressure of peers and status. # CMC can facilitate the efficiency of group work since it saves time when irrelevant interpersonal influence decreases. # Group members can enjoy more \\"democratic\\" atmosphere in CMC than that in FtF communication. In addition, anonymity, which can result in more freedom for members to verbalize without feeling pressure from high-status members, is one of the most important features of CMC. Early CMC group research suggested that CMC groups were better for task-oriented interactions than their FtF counterparts. In task-oriented situations, where overly personal interpersonal interaction is not desired, then impersonal interaction is the appropriate kind of interaction, because the communication exchanges are more focused on the group's task. For example, a geographically dispersed technology team tasked with solving a software application bug may be more productive when the communication is task focused rather than interpersonal in nature. This doesn't mean that all CMC is impersonal, but points out that specific contexts may be better suited for impersonal interaction rather than personal exchanges. Then, Walther stated that CMC is not always impersonal; instead, it can also develop social relationships. Although there is less social information exchange in CMC because of the absence of nonverbal cues, as the communication time increases, the exchange of social information is increasing accordingly. And the anticipation of future communication may make communicators to look for more information about the other. This mechanism leads to similar immediacy, similarity, composure, and receptivity as in FtF communication. However, there is a shortcoming. Since it takes time for CMC to achieve consensus, if the time for CMC is limited, the information exchanged will be much less than do FtF, which may impact the efficiency of group work. Finally, Walther brought up the concept of hyperpersonal communication, which demonstrates that \\"CMC that is more socially desirable than we tend to experience in parallel FtF interaction.\\" Walther proposes that CMC users do take part in hyperpersonal communication. Senders and receivers engage in the process of selective-self presentation through the message they create and send. This can lead to the idealization of the sender by the receiver based on making attributions from available paralingual cues found in the message. This process is enhanced with asynchronous exchanges, letting both sender and receiver have ample time to consider the messages sent and received. Hyperpersonal interaction would be excessively or above normal personal interaction. In other words, online relationships can develop into hyperpersonal that is excessively personal. When users experience commonality and are self-aware, physically separated, and communicating via a limited-cues channel, they can selectively self-present and edit their communication, enabling them to construct and reciprocate representations of their partners and relations without the interference of environmental reality. Hyperpersonal communication can thus be defined as computer-mediated interaction that is more attractive than experiences in similar FtF exchanges. The hyperpersonal model can be understood by looking at the established communication processes that include sender, receiver, channel, and feedback. The sender uses the process of selective self-presentation; this refers to CMC users' ability to manage their online image. Being able to self-censor and manipulate messages is possible to do within a CMC context to a greater extent than in FtF interactions, so individuals have greater control over what cues are sent. He made this argument in four aspects of the communication process: receivers, senders, characteristics of the channel, and feedback processes. = Relationship between Hyperpersonal Model and CMC = There are results showing that under CMC, relational intimacy increased faster than FtF. One of the logics behind this finding is that hyperpersonal model is determining the inflated nature of feedback in CMC. Online communication behaviors have the possibility to exaggerate the influence on self-expression or self- presentations and following internalization. The theoretical assumption of the inflated interpersonal feedback in CMC pointed out in the hyperpersonal model by Walther is advanced by this research. Hyperpersonal model can be deemed as the theoretical framework for the research on exaggerated social process in CMC mainly from the following perspectives: 1)selective presentation, 2)Impression management, 3)Impression management in CMC, 4) idealized interpretation, 5)interpersonal feedback loop, 6)Identity shift, and 7) influence of feedback on identity shift. Examples and application = Relational Intimacy Comparison between CMC & FtF = * Hian, Chuan, Trevor and Detenber's 2006 study shows support for the hyperpersonal model. They found that relational intimacy increased at a faster rate in CMC than in FtF interactions. * The hyperpersonal theory is also confirmed in a study of the disclosure-intimacy link in CMC vs FtF communication. Research proved that CMC \\"intensified the association between disclosure and intimacy relative to face- to-face interactions, and this intensification was fully mediated by increased interpersonal (relationship) attributions observed in the computer-mediated condition.\\" *Walther J.B. also explored in a study the effect of CMC on international collaborations and further affirmed the theory of hyperpersonal model. The results showed that relationships were fostered better in computer- mediated environments versus other mediations. *Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock use the hyperpersonal model to indicate the understandings of intimacy interpersonal relationships through CMC. In their study, the three researchers established \\"some online relationships tend to be more intimate than FtF relationships and CMC interactions are often rated as significantly more intimate than FtF counterparts. One approach to explain this phenomenon is the hyperpersoanl model, which highlights the cognitive and behavioral processes and CMC affordances that can contribute to greater online intimacy\\". They depicted that people tend to \\"put their best foot forward\\"while engaging in CMC relationships. They found that CMC allows a person to self-present themselves. One thing they studied throughout this research was the context of online dating. Online dating allows a person to post a picture of themselves that they chose and avoid a less attractive photo of them. Jiang, Bazarova and Hancock discovered that \\"related to the sender's behavior in CMC, people appear to be more comfortable disclosing personal information in CMC than FtF\\". Jiang, et al. argue this may lead to a \\"more positive hyperpersonal relationship” = Online Relationships =  Online Friendships  * In the article titled \\"'I've never clicked this much with anyone in my life': Trust and hyperpersonal communication in online friendships\\", Samantha Henderson and Michael Gilding (2004) explored the development of trust in hyperpersonal communication. They found that, in hyperpersonal communication, 1) online trust depends on the reputation of pseudonymous identities; 2) the online communication performance is essential in building up online trust; 3) hyperpersonal communication and online trust can be facilitated by pre- commitment; 4) situational factors in Western societies can help to promote the active trust in hyperpersonal communication.  Online Romantic Relationships  * Anderson and Emmers-Sommer used hyperpersonal theory to test their predictors of relationship satisfaction in online romantic relationships. Based on hyperpersonal theory, it's likely that users of CMC would feel more satisfaction in an online relationship since the communication is enhanced and there is a reduced number of cues on which to base the relationship. *In another study titled \\"Predictors of relationship satisfaction in online romantic relationships\\" hyperpersonal model was affirmed by predicting a high rate of satisfaction in relationships fostered online. *Another research of \\"modality switching\\" between online and offline dating elaborates the role of hyperpersonal model takes in providing clues of self-presentation and self-disclosure in online dating. In terms of the self- disclosure, in online dating which is hyperpersonal communication, there is a perceived anonymity which can accelerate the rate of self-disclosure. As for self-presentation, online daters portray idealized versions of selves. * Hyperpersonal model is used by Gentile to examine relationship maintenance, satisfaction, and affectionate communication in romantic relationships, along with attachment theory. This research is different from the traditional ones but focusing on already-established relationships. Based on the background of university students increasingly use SNS(social network sites) in their romantic relationships maintenance, this research use hyperpersonal model and attachment theory to examine how they maintain their relationship satisfaction. = Application in Social Media = * In an article titled \\"The Implications of Heavy and Non-use of Social Media: An Auto-Ethnographic Approach\\", Adam Whiteside looked into the difference in attitudes and opinions between heavy and non-users of social media.  Facebook as an Example  *Wang et al 2010 affirms the \\"Hyperpersonal Model\\". More males & females showed a preference for attractive profile pictures when it came to initiating friendships.Thus non-verbal cues played an important role in this study. The emotions in virtual communication theory is also thus reaffirmed through this study as well. * In their study \\"Mirror Mirror on my Facebook wall: Effects of exposure to Facebook on self esteem\\" authors Amy Gonzales & Jeffrey T. Hancock used the hyperpersonal model to study whether Facebook usage enhanced self- esteem or not. The results of this study showed that participants became self- aware once they were on their individual profile pages. Once participants edited their Facebook profile they reported high levels of self-esteem. These findings suggest that selective self representation in digital media leads to intensified relationship formation. Thus a high involvement on social media definitely enhances self-esteem. *In a comprehensive study for exploring the social media such as Facebook, focusing on identity shift in CMC and other channels of the model. = Lies on the Internet = *In their book \\"Truth, Lies & Trust on the Internet\\" authors Monica Whilly and Adam Johnson also affirm the hyperpersonal model. They talk about the formation of hyperpersonal relationships being formed on the Internet due to extreme proximity and closeness. In this book they go one step further and talk about the issues of truth, lies and trust in these relationships. Several stories in the book talk about how the Internet's anonymity basically enables high levels of self disclosures in relationships which can in turn possibly lead to deception and flaming. * In a study titled the \\"Perceptions of trustworthiness online : the role of visual and textual information by Catalina L. Toma looks at the role of textual information available in a profile versus the images on an individual's profile. The findings were that textual information generally elicited more trustworthiness among profile browsers and the addition of an image reduced it. *In another study titled \\"The lies we tell and what it says about us: Using behavorial characteristics to explain Facebook activity\\" further breaks down online participants of communication into communicators (one to one) & broadcasters (one to many). They hyperpersonal model was affirmed in the communicators group who reported high group cohesion. *In a research on \\"An Examination of Deceptive Self-Presentation in Online Dating Profiles\\", the relationship between online self-presentation, deception, and romantic relationships are examined using a novel cross-validation technique. It focuses on the separation between the self presented online and the embodied self, as the computer-mediated-communication creates chances of hyperpersonal communications of misrepresentation in the online dating profile among genders. = Application in Medical Treatment = * Jeanine Warisse Turner, Jean A. Grube, and Jennifer Meyers discussed in their work, titled 'Developing an optimal match within online communities: An exploration of CMC support communities and traditional support', the application of hyperpersonal model in the context of cancer treatment. They found that: 1) CMC can play a significantly important role for patients to seek support, which confirmed the hyperpersonal model in the context of patients' communication; 2) the experience of face-to-face communication with a partner will enhance the relationship of hyperpersonal communication; 3) a deep face-to-face relationship may lead to an indirect way of communication since partners are concerned with offending others even though they still want to offer support, while CMC communication is more able to focus on a specific goal. * In 2003, James D. Robinson and Jeanine Turner published a research titled 'Impersonal, interpersonal, and hyperpersonal social support: Cancer and older adults'. This study focused on the social support and supportive communication of the old with cancer. They explore this fact from the optimal matching perspective brought up by Cutrona and Russell (1990), which demonstrate that \\"successful socially supportive interactions ... occur when the type of support desired by the individual is of the same type as the social support efforts of the provider.\\" In this article, the authors cited several previous studies to confirm that hyperpersonal communication is helpful for the olds with cancer illness in seeking social support. = Application in Group/Community Activities = * The hyperpersonal model posits that in the absences of cues available in FtF encounters, distributed partners form exaggerated impressions other group members. Pena, Walther and Hancock (2007) looked at perceptions of dominance in collocated virtual groups versus distributed groups. The results indicate that collocated groups perceived member dominance to be less extreme than in distributed groups. But there appeared to be no difference in the way collocated group members and distributed group member's perceived dominance. This supports the assertion that CMC environments intensify impression development, as suggested by the hyperpersonal models element of selective self-presentation. * One study looking at perceived behaviors of assigned versus emergent leaders in CMC groups found that the \\"reification of behavioral stereotypes through hyperpersonal CMC allows emergent leaders to develop greater recognition\\" (p. 2). The question posed by these authors was under which conditions, having an assigned group leader or an unassigned group leader, would a leader emerge in a CMC context. They speculated that leaders emerge in CMC groups, as suggested by the hyperpersonal model, through the development of online behaviors. Wickham and Walther found that in CMC groups, there is greater consensus among group members about the group leader when the leader emerges from the group opposed to leaders being assigned to the group. Within assigned leader groups, leaders were not rated as being more intelligent than other group members. In contrast, in unassigned leader groups, there was a strong associated between perceived intelligence and leader emergence. *In another study by Anita L. Blanchard titled \\"Testing a sense of a model of a community\\" talks about group salience being higher on a virtual community, thus, reaffirming the hyperpersonal model assumptions. = Social Anxiety = * Andrew C. High and Scott E. Caplan(2008) explore the application of hyperpersonal model in the context of mitigating social anxiety caused by the \\"desire to create a positive impression in social settings along with a general lack of self-presentational confidence.\\" The result indicated that the association of social anxiety and people's perception of social anxiety and the association of social anxiety and one's partner's conversational satisfaction are contingent in CMC. = Application in Traditional Communication Tools = * In a 2006 study on politeness of requests made via email and voicemail, Kirk Duthler determined that emails were ranked more polite because users had more time to compose their requests compared to the voicemail user. Duthler's study supports hyperpersonal theory. He said: \\"The filtering of nonverbal cues advantages communicators. Communicators are strategically enabled to manipulate their identity, time the transmission of their messages, and plan, organize, and edit their communication in pursuit of relational goals. Such strategic control in CMC can facilitate negotiation, relationship development, and social tasks.\\" *In his thesis \\"Text messaging: The new venue of self-disclosure\\" in 2010, Steven Brunner thoroughly studied the text messaging as a relational enhancing device, from the perspectives of hyperpersonal theory, social penetration theory, and others. = Marketing = * The evolution route of marketing has gone \\"from big and broad to small and hyperpersonal\\". The interaction between customers and business processes in microlevel conversation through a hyper- personalized experience. Critique Joyce Lamerichs and Hedwig F. M. Te Molder from the department of communication science at Wageningen University and Research Centre evaluate the ways in which computer-mediated communication (CMC) has thus far been conceptualized, proposing an alternative approach. They argue that traditional perspectives ignore participants' everyday understanding of media use and media characteristics by relying on an individualistic and cognitive framework. The social identity model of deindividuation effects model totally disregards identity construction in daily communication activities like talk, text & email. In order to understand this they tried to re study online interaction and specifically studied an online forum on depression. It is shown that participants' identities do not so much mirror their inner worlds but are discourse practices in their own right. Sonja Utz examined friendships in the virtual world and revealed a high level of skepticism in participants when it came to CMC using social information processing theory. Related theory = Daft & Lengel's Media Richness Theory = Daft and Lengel's Media Richness theory first began in the setting of organizations to evaluate media channels within. The theory describes having a set of organizational communication channels with objectives that enable researchers to determine the capacity of rich information. According to Daft and Lengel, they believe communication channels such as email and phone recede the necessary abilities to convey messages that use rich information. = Kock's Media Naturalness and Channel Expansion Theory = Ned Kock, is a researcher of the Media Naturalness and Channel Expansion theory (CET). In 2004, Kock originally argued that humans were not equipped to deal with CMC when compared to \\"richer\\" forms of communication like FtF interactions. He reasoned this by stating that people evolved in FtF communication and have not had time to evolve into being equally adequate CMC communicators. The Channel Expansion Theory challenges Kock's view of evolutionary changes. CET illustrates how a person is able to develop certain perceptions of a new media channel. In contrast, in 2011, Kock revisits the issue of Media Naturalness in light of the Channel Expansion theory and, in turn, argues that Media Naturalness and CET can co-exist. Kock finally concludes that CMC interactions can achieve \\"positive effects\\" when compared to an equivalent FtF interaction, in the case of distance learning. =SIDE model= SIDE model is a recent development of deindividuation theory, refers to social identity/deindividuation model. It demonstrates that it is that the property of group identity increases, rather other that individual identity loses, that leading to the occurring changes of CMC users. SIDE model predicts that in CMC, the sense of self diminishes, while the sense of group increases. SIDE model is distinguished from classical deindividuation theory which put its focus on the sense of self rather than the sense of group identity. =Impression management= In the work titled 'The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life' (1959), Goffman demonstrated that in FtF communication, people use verbal and nonverbal languages to present appropriately and favorably to others since they care about the image or impression they leave for others and others' perception towards them. This phenomenon is called impression management. While in text-based CMC, the modification of impression is limited to \\"language, typographic, and chronemic information.\\" = Deindividuation = Deindividuation is a social psychology theory being generally thought as the loss of self-awareness in groups, though this is a matter of contention. = Interpersonal communication = Interpersonal communication is a process of information exchange between two or more people. This research generally contributes to six categories of inquiry: 1) how humans adapt their verbal communication and nonverbal communication during face-to-face communication, 2) the message production processes. 3) how uncertainty influences our behavior and information-management strategies, 4) deceptive communication, 5) relational dialectics, and 6) social interaction that is mediated by technology. = Media richness theory = Media richness theory, also sometimes referred to as information richness theory/MRT, is introduced by Richard L.

He caught the attention of President Woodrow Wilson in 1914 after being one of the few newspaper reporters to correctly predict that the German Empire would go to war with Serbia over the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (which caused the start of World War I). Expressing a desire to put into practice many of the administrative practices he had reported on from Europe, Brownlow sought and won from President Wilson appointment in 1915 as a commissioner of the District of Columbia, serving until 1920.The Constitution of the United States gives the United States Congress the authority to govern the District of Columbia. Between 1874 and 1952, Congress delegated that authority to a three-person Board of Commissioners. One of the Commissioners would serve as President of the Board.

The station is owned by Horizon Christian Fellowship of Fitchburg. History The station went on the air February 15, 1950 as WFGM at 1580 kilohertz. WFGM's original studios were located on the 3rd floor of a downtown building at the corner of Main and Prichard Streets in Fitchburg. The original transmitter included one broadcast tower on Lunenburg Street near the current intersection of John Fitch Highway. The station had a power output of 1,000 watts. Several years later, new studios were constructed in a renovated townhouse at 170 Prichard Street, which was then renamed Broadcast House. A new 4-tower transmitter was constructed atop Alpine Hill and the station's frequency was changed to 960 kHz. In 1960, the station was granted a license for FM station WFGM-FM (104.5), which later became WBNE, WFMP and eventually WXLO. On November 1, 1962, the stations were sold to local businessman George Chatfield who in turn acquired a local newspaper, The Montachusett Review. The AM's callsign was changed to WFGL in 1967. WFMP-FM became popular for featuring country music in the 1970s featuring the legendary Gene LaVerne and Dave Brown. In 1979 both stations were sold to Montachusett Broadcasting. During this time period it featured the on-air talents of Dave Svens, Scott May, Paul Belfay, Greg Vine, Gail Dussault and Al Brodie, among others. Over the years the station had an adult contemporary format but in 1982 switched to a standards format featuring big bands from the 1930s and 1940s as well as easy listening hits of the 1940s and 1950s, non-rock songs from the late '50s and '60s, and an occasional easy listening song from the '70s. The station focused on big bands and standards from the mid-'40s to late '50s. The station ran the syndicated format Stardust on overnights only initially. By 1986, they were using the satellite format middays, evenings, overnights, and weekends after noon. The music also gradually was modified both on satellite and locally as soft rock songs from the '50s to the early '80s were being mixed in. By 1990 the station was playing about half baby boomer pop and half standards both locally and on the satellite format. WFGL was granted a power increase to 2,500 watts in 1984. In 1991, the station shut down locally, the station was renamed to WXLO, and programming was converted to a simulcast of WXLO-FM. Soon afterward, the station went silent; during the silent period, the WFGL callsign was reinstated. The station was then sold, and resumed broadcasting in October 1994 with the current Christian format. In 2001, the studios moved to their current location in a refurbished brick mill building. WFGL went silent on November 8, 2018 while the station's transmitter was being repaired; after repairs were completed, it resumed broadcasting January 26, 2019. Programming Throughout its initial years WFGM and WFGL were considered full service radio stations, providing news and current affairs programming to the Fitchburg area communities. Among the programs carried was Frankly Speaking, a telephone call-in talk program that ran in various forms for over thirty years. The station also broadcast a middle of the road music format, featuring popular vocalists of the time. On-air talent in the mid-1960s included Ed Broughey, Bill Sterling, Ron Morgan, and Jerry McRell. Walt Clancy and Tom Conry did the news. Jim Chalmers was General Manager and sports announcer. Don Coleman was Chief Engineer, assisted by Jim Sullivan and Mal Coburn. Ray Loter programmed and was on-air for WBNE in the evening, when it did not simulcast WFGM. The stations owned an Amphicar, which made frequent appearances in parades as well as in Lake Whalom. As did many radio stations, in the 1980s the music format shifted to what became known as adult contemporary. The station also featured many popular local personalities including Tal Hood, Ed Broughey, Dick Ziegler. Chester Gaylord and, in the earlier years part-timer Jeff Mitchell. In 1985 the station returned to its musical roots by switching to a traditional pop music format, once again featuring popular vocalists and instrumentals from the 1930s through 1960s, while also serving as a full service outlet carrying live local sports and news. At this time the station was an affiliate of the CBS Radio Network.

Kickoff specialists are members of the special teams. They are responsible for kicking the ball in the kickoff. These players tend to have a strong leg, often capable of making touchbacks, and capable of keeping a ball in the bounds of the field of play but do not have the accuracy or technique required to be a full-time placekicker or punter. Some kickoff specialists later become full- time placekickers, while some are marginal placekickers who are soon out of football. Due to modern roster restrictions (and a 2016 rule change discouraging the kicking of touchbacks by awarding the receiving team possession at the 25-yard line instead of the 20), most NFL teams do not elect to have a kickoff specialist, and instead use their placekickers (or, less often, punters) on kickoffs. The most recent NFL kickoff specialist was Jordan Gay, who played the position for the Buffalo Bills under special teams coach Danny Crossman from 2014 to 2016. Prior to Gay's being claimed off waivers, Buffalo's kickoff duties were handled by Billy Cundiff and John Potter, who likewise were kickoff specialists during their time in Buffalo; for 2017, the team brought in former high school kicking phenom Austin Rehkow as a contender for the position but opted not to use a kickoff specialist that year. Other players who have spent at least some time as kickoff specialist for an NFL team since 2006 include Steven Hauschka, Rhys Lloyd, David Buehler, Todd Carter, and Brandon McManus. As of the end of the 2014 NFL season, punters Thomas Morstead, Matt Bosher, Sam Martin, Pat McAfee, and Michael Koenen handle kickoffs. There is at least one example of a backup quarterback serving as a kickoff specialist; in 1965, Bob Timberlake did so for the New York Giants. In high school football and most other professional leagues, such as the Arena Football League and, until recent roster expansions, the Canadian Football League, one kicker handles all three kicking positions. Even college football teams usually do not use kickoff specialists, despite the much larger rosters at that level; however, if an underclassman has a stronger leg than the upperclassman kicker, but is not yet ready to assume placekicker or punter duties, they will handle kickoff a while being the primary backup to the other positions.

A former principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre, he has served as the company's artistic director since 1992. Education The youngest of 11 children, McKenzie began taking dance lessons at the urging of his father, who was eager to see his son become the next Fred Astaire. Shortly after his first lesson at the O'Brien School of Dance, he found that he was drawn more to ballet than to tap dancing. After being informed of their great talent, his mother sent him and his sister to study at the Washington School of Ballet under the directorship of Mary Day. Mary Day created an environment where dancers were able to explore their own opinions. It is because of her training that he became interested in story telling and developing characters, which led him to be intrigued with ballet theater. Following a year long bout of ulcerative colitis, McKenzie spent his senior year on preparing for the Varna International Ballet Competition. At the 1972 edition of the competition, he was awarded the silver medal for his performance in the junior division. As a professional dancer, he trained with Maggie Black in addition to other professionals including Georgina Parkinson, Twyla Tharp, and Anthony Dowell. He also worked on acting with Mary Day throughout his career. Career After his win, McKenzie joined The Washington Ballet, making his professional debut at the Kennedy Center in Les Sylphides. He left the company in 1974 to join the Joffrey Ballet, where he performed as a principal dancer. He turned down Joffrey at first to see if he could get into Ballet Theater, but eventually accepted Joffrey's offer after getting advice from a colleague. In regards to his time as a professional dancer at Joffrey, he has said he \\"learned how to learn there.\\" He believes his experience at Joffrey is what shaped him into an adult. In 1979, he departed to join American Ballet Theatre as a soloist. The following year after joining ABT, he was promoted to principal dancer. During his time at ABT, McKenzie danced all of the major roles in the repertoire, but he performed best in princely roles. As a principal dancer in ABT, some of the roles he performed include Solo in La Bayadere, Don Jose in Carmen, the Prince in Mikhail Baryshnikov’s production of the full-length Cinderella, Franz in Coppélia, the Gentleman With Her in Dim Lustre, Basil and Espada in Don Quixote (Kitri’s Wedding), Albrecht in Giselle, a leading role in The Garden of Villandry, Her Lover in Jardin aux Lilas, the leading role in The Leaves Are Fading, the Friend in Pillar of Fire, the leading role in Raymonda (Grand Pas Hongrois), a featured role in Requiem, the Champion Roper in Rodeo, Romeo and Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet, Prince Desire in The Sleeping Beauty, Prince Siegfried in Swan Lake, James in La Sylphide and the leading roles in Other Dances, Paquita, Les Sylphides, the Sylvia Pas de Deux and Theme and Variations. He created the role of Amnon in Martine van Hamel’s Amnon V’Tamar and a leading role in Clark Tippet’s S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A. Retiring from ABT in 1991, he returned to Washington Ballet to assist Mary Day as her associate director. The following year he returned to ABT to take over as artistic director. McKenzie has a deep regard that ABT needs to \\"have the best it can possibly have,\\" in terms of faculty members and administration. During his professional dance career, McKenzie performed in cities across the world including Italy, Paris, London, Tokyo, etc. He had the opportunity to dance with the London Festival Ballet, the Bolshoi Ballet, the National Ballet of Cuba, and the Universal Ballet in Seoul. McKenzie was given the role of permanent guest artist with The Washington Ballet in 1989. In 1991, he became the Associate Artistic Director of the company. He was also Associate Artistic Director and a choreographer for Martine van Hamel's New Amsterdam Ballet. Before becoming Artistic Director of ABT in 1992, his choreographic credits include Groupo Zambaria (1984) and Liszt Études (1991), which were both choreographed for Martine van Hamel’s New Amsterdam Ballet. He had also choreographed Lucy and the Count (1992) for The Washington Ballet. For American Ballet Theater, he choreographed The Nutcracker (1993), Don Quixote (1995, in collaboration with Susan Jones) a new production of Swan Lake (2000), a new production of Raymond (2004) with choreography by Anna-Marie Holmes, and a new production of The Sleeping Beauty in 2004 with Gelsey Kirkland and Michael Chernov. In 2014, he staged a new production of Raymond Divertissements with Irina Kolpakova. At the time that he took over, ABT was $5.7 million dollars in debt and on the brink of collapse. Revitalizing the repertoire with new versions of The Nutcracker and Don Quixote, the company's fortunes were further strengthened by the arrival of Paloma Herrera and Angel Corella whose performances proved box-office gold. Adopting a new guest-star strategy, McKenzie gathered the strongest roster of male ballet stars in the world to continue the company's box-office success. By the end of the 90's, performances from Julio Bocca, Jose Manuel Careno, Vladimir Malakhov, Corella, Ethan Stiefel, Alessandra Ferri, Julie Kent, Herrera, and Irina Dvorovenko ensured that the company's fortunes remained high. Though a few dancers, such as Gillian Murphy, David Hallberg, Marcelo Gomes, and Herman Cornejo were promoted naturally through the ranks, this star-casting scheme had the unfortunate side effect of suppressing opportunities for the upcoming generation of dancers With the retirement of this wave of leading dancers over the course of the late aughts, McKenzie changed course on the company's policy of importing established stars by opening the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School to nurture the company's homegrown talent and appointing Alexei Ratmansky as Artist in Residence to shape ABT's future choreographically. In recent years, while the company continues to perform McKenzie's versions of Don Quixote and Swan Lake, his Nutcracker and The Sleeping Beauty have been replaced by Ratmansky's restorations. Even as he has continued to support Ratmansky's choreographic endeavours, McKenzie has also invested in commissioning new work from female choreographers, particularly Jessica Lang. McKenzie stresses the importance of versatility in dancers, and being open to new ideas and training. He has stated it is crucial to \\"produce a dancer who is thoughtful, well-developed, but in the absence of style.\\" He also believes that individual teachers create great dancers, not necessarily schools or training programs as a whole. McKenzie stresses the importance of dancers bringing their own unique style to pieces. He calls on music a lot as a dancer and a choreographer. McKenzie usually works with dancers on the classical ballets, but believes dancers have to find what is universally truthful about their interpretations.

It concerns the armed conflicts of the Illyrian tribes and their kingdoms in the Balkans in Italy as well as pirate activity in Mediterranean. Apart from conflicts between Illyrians and neighbouring nations and tribes, numerous wars were recorded among Illyrian tribes themselves. Illyrians were renowned warriors, according to ancient sources. They were known as skilled craftsmen and shipbuilders in ancient times and controlled much of the Adriatic and Ionian Sea using their numerous warships. Illyrians had effective weapons such as the sica, a curved-tip sword that originated in Illyria and was eventually adopted all over the Balkans and used later by the Romans. Mythological Instances of Illyrians engaged in armed conflict occurred in Greek mythology and specifically in the legend of Cadmus and Harmonia, where Cadmus led the Illyrian EncheliiApollodorus, Library, 3.5.4. \\"As the Encheleans were being attacked by the Illyrians, the god declared by an oracle that they would get the better of the Illyrians if they had Cadmus and Harmonia as their leaders. They believed him, and made them their leaders against the Illyrians, and got the better of them.

The Encheleans had been promised victory by an Oracle if Cadmus and Harmonia would lead them and as this condition was fulfilled they were indeed victorious.\\" If the legend is true this war would have occurred around 2000 BC, the time when Cadmus has been claimed to have lived. Tribal conflicts Illyrian tribes were reluctant to help each other in times of war and even fought amongst each other and they sometimes allied with the neighbouring RomansThe Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 98, ...North of Dassaretis in the middle and upper valley of the Genusus was the territory of the Illyrian Parthini, likely to have been part of the Taulantii until they first appear as Roman allies late in the third century ...\\" and Greeks:Arthur Edward Romilly Boak and William Gurnee Sinnigen. A History of Rome to A.D. 565, page 111, The island of Pharos and some adjacent territory in Illyria were given to a Greek adventurer, Demetrius of Pharos These conflicts happened because of land, pastures and areas of natural substances such as iron and salt. The Romans, before they conquered Illyria, were involved in tribal conflicts and used them to their advantage. The most known incident is the involvement of the Romans in a war between the Dalmatians and the Liburnians over Promona, which in the end were encouraged to take peace. Commonly the Romans were ordered to act as referees in their bloody fights. The tribe of Autariatae fought against the Ardiaei for control of valuable salt mines.The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 223, \\"The salt source that was a cause of conflict between the Illyrian Ardiaei and Autariatae may be that at Orahovica in the upper Neretva valley near Konjic.\\" The Ardiaei were notorious before being defeated by the Romans.The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 216, The Ardiaei, or Vardaei as they were known to the Romans, once the ravagers of Italy and now reduced to a mere... The Daorsi had suffered attacks from the Delmatae to the extent that they requested Roman aid. States The earliest recorded Illyrian Kingdom was that of the Enchele in the 8th century BC. The Enchele held dominance for two centuries until their state crumbled from the start of the 6th century BC.Aleksandar Stipčević – Illyrians, The Illyrian Art, The Illyrian Cult Symbols page 46-47. After the Enchelii the Taulanti formed their own state in the 7th century BC. The Autariatae under Pleurias (337 BC) were a kingdom.. The Kingdom of the Ardiaei began at 230 BC and ended at 167 BC.. The most notable Illyrian kingdoms and dynasties were those of Bardyllis of the Dardani and of Agron of the Ardiaei who created the last and best-known Illyrian kingdom.. Agron ruled over the Ardiaei and had extended his rule to other tribes as well.. As for the Dardanians, they always had separate domains from the rest of the Illyrians.. The Illyrian kingdoms were composed of small areas within region of Illyria. The exact extent of even the most prominent ones remains unknown.. Only the Romans ruled the entire region. The internal organization of the south Illyrian kingdoms points to imitation of their neigh boring Greek kingdoms and influence from the Greek and Hellenistic world in the growth of their urban centres.. Polybius gives us an image of society within an Illyrian kingdom as peasant infantry fought under aristocrats which he calls in Greek Polydynastae (Greek: Πολυδυνάστες) where each one controlled a town within the kingdom.. The monarchy was established on hereditary lines and Illyrian rulers used marriages as a means of alliance with other powers.. Pliny (23–79 AD) writes that the people that formed the nucleus of the Illyrian kingdom were 'Illyrians proper' or Illyrii Proprie Dicti.. They were the Taulantii, the Pleraei, the Endirudini, Sasaei, Grabaei and the Labeatae. These later joined to form the Docleatae. Liburnian thalassocracy Map of Corfu, the Liburnians most southern recorded outpost Navigable skills and mobility of the Liburnians on their swift ships, the Liburna allowed them to be present, very early, not only along the Eastern Adriatic coast, they reached also the opposite, western, Italic coast. This process started during great Pannonian- Adriatic movements and migrations at the end of the Bronze Age, from the 12th to 10th century BC. In the Iron Age, they were already in the Italic coast, establishing colonies in Apulia and especially in Picenum, where specific Iron Age cultures developed.Š. Batović, Le relazioni culturali etc., 30, 42; La “koine” adriatica e il suo processo di formazione, Jadranska obala u protohistoriji. From the 9th to the 6th century BC there was certain koine – cultural unity in the Adriatic, with the general Liburninan seal, whose naval supremacy meant both political and economical authority through several centuries. Some similar toponyms attested not only Liburnian but also other Illyrian migrations to the central and south Italy, respectively Apulia and Picenum.M. Zaninović, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc.

According to Strabo,Strabo, Geography, 6.2, \\"While Archias was on his voyage to Sicily, he left Chersicrates, a chief of the race of the Heracleidæ with a part of the expedition to settle the island now called Corcyra,62 but anciently called Scheria, and he, having expelled the Liburni who possessed it, established his colony in the island.\\" the Liburnians became masters of island of Corcyra, making it their most southern outpost, by which they controlled the passage into the Adriatic Sea. In 735 BC, they abandoned it, under pressure of Corinthian ruler Hersikrates, during the period of Corinthian expansion to South Italy, Sicily and the Ionian Sea. However, their position in the Adriatic Sea was still strong in the next few centuries. Corinth was the first that went up against the Liburnians.

They planted a colony at Epidamnus and drove the Illyrian fleets back to the region of Scodra.\\" for the aid of Corinth and Corcyra against the Liburni. The Greeks were victorious. Liburnian control of the Adriatic Sea coasts started to decrease in the 6th century BC. According to Pliny the Elder, the Liburnians lost supremacy in the Western Adriatic coast due to invasion of the Umbri and the Gauls, obviously caused by strengthening and expansion of the Etruscan union in the 6th century BC, whose rich material presence in the basin of Po river, undoubtedly meant weakening of the Liburnian thalassocracy influence in the north-west of Adriatic. Celtic breaks to the Italian peninsula, after 400 BC, significantly changed ethnic and political picture there, it directly imperilled remaining Liburnian possessions on the western coast. Unlike at the western Adriatic coast, Celtic raids to the narrow Liburnian region at the eastern Adriatic coast were peripheral in geographical meaning. Despite of recorded material exchange, Celtic archaeological forms are marginal and secondary in regions settled by Histri, Iapodes, Dalmatae and are especially rare in Liburnian Iron Age heritage. Iapygian–Tarentine Wars The Iapygian- Tarentine Wars were a set of conflicts and wars between the Greek colony of Taras (Taranto) and the three Iapygian peoples, Messapians, Peucetii and Daunians. Conflicts started immediately after the foundation of Tars in 706 BC over domination of the fertile adjacent plains in southern Italy. The expansion of Taranto was limited to the coast because of the resistance of the populations of inner Apulia. In 473 BC, Taranto signed an alliance with Rhegion, to counter the Messapii, Peuceti, and Lucanians, but the joint armies of the Tarentines and Rhegines were defeated near Kailìa (modern Ceglie), in what HerodotusHerodotus, vii 170. claims to be the greatest slaughter of Greeks in his knowledge, with 3,000 Reggians and uncountable Tarentines killed. In 466 BC, Taranto was again defeated by the Iapyges; according to Aristotle,Politica, v 1303a. who praises its government, there were so many aristocrats killed that the democratic party was able to get the power, to remove the monarchy, inaugurate a democracy, and expel the Pythagoreans. In c.440 BC the Messapian city-state of Brindisi entered into an alliance with Thurii. The Brindisi-Thurri army had a leadership advantage in the form of Cleandridas, an exiled Spartan general who had been banished from the Peloponnese for accepting an Athenian bribe as an advisor of the Spartan king Pleistoanax. Taranto supported the Peloponnesian side against Athens in the Peloponnesian War, refused anchorage and water to Athens in 415 BC, and even sent ships to help the Peloponnesians, after the Athenian disaster in Sicily. On the other side, Athens supported the Messapians, in order to counter Taranto power. After 330 BC the Messapians joined forces with the Tarentines against an even greater force, that of Rome. The alliances with Taras and with Cleonimus of Sparta in 304 BC was an anti-Roman campaign. Thus towards the end of the fourth century Rome had become a common enemy for both the Iapygians and the Tarentines, even as far as ending the prolonged battles and causing them to make an alliance.Diodorus, XVI, 63. Illyrian expansion In the 4th century BC Bardyllis became king of the Illyrians and creator of a new dynasty after overthrowing Sirras, the previous Illyrian king, who had entered in a peace treaty over the control of Lyncestis. Bardyllis succeeded in bringing various tribes into a single organisation and soon became a formidable power in the Balkans, resulting in a change of relations with Macedonia. Using new war tactics in 393 BC the Illyrians won a decisive battle against Amyntas III, expelling him and ruling Macedonia through a puppet king. in 392 BC Amyntas III allied himself with the Thessalians and took Macedonia under his rule, taking it from the Dardanians. After continuous invasions Bardyllis forced the Macedonians to pay him an annual tribute in 372 BC. Military expeditions of Bardyllis in Epirus In 385 BC Bardyllis raided Epirus which was under Molossian rule. This time the Illyrians were allied with and aided by DionysiusHammond, N. G. L.

Thus their attempt to control Epirus failed. In 360 BC, another Illyrian attack forced the Molossian king Arymbas to evacuate his non-combatant population to Aetolia and let the Illyrians loot freely. The stratagem worked and the Molossians fell upon the Illyrians who were encumbered with booty and defeated them.Diodorus Siculus. Library, Books 14.92, 15.2, 16.2. In the same year Arymbas of the Mollosians defeated the Illyrians after they raided and looted Epirus. In 360 BC the southern Paeonian tribes launched raids against Macedonia in support of an Illyrian invasion. In 359 BC Bardyllis won a decisive battle against the Macedonian king Perdiccas III in which the king himself was killed along with 4,000 of his soldiers and the Illyrians occupied the cities of upper Macedonia.The Cambridge ancient history: The fourth century B.C.

Gallic invasions From the 4th century BC, Celtic groups pushed into the Carpathian region and the Danube basin, coinciding with their movement into Italy.

By the 3rd century, the native inhabitants of Pannonia were almost completely Celticized.Pannonia and Upper Moesia. A History of the Middle Danube Provinces of the Roman Empire. A Mocsy, S Frere The Illyrians had been waging war against the Greeks, leaving their western flank weak. Whilst Alexander ruled Greece, the Celts dared not to push south near Greece. Therefore, early Celtic expeditions were concentrated against Illyrian tribes.The Illyrians. A Stipcevic. Noyes Press. pg 44 We have little information about the affairs in the Illyrian hinterland, but we do know that the first Balkan tribe to be defeated by the Celts was the Autariatae, who during the 4th century had enjoyed a hegemony over much of the central Balkans, centred on the Morava valley. An interesting account of cunning Celtic tactics is revealed in their attacks on the Ardiaei. In 310 BC, Celtic general Molistomos attacked deep into Illyrian territory, subduing the Dardanians and the Paeonians. In 280 BC they moved in three directions: toward Macedonia and Illyria, toward Greece, and toward Thrace. The main army according to Diodorus, of 150,000-foot soldiers equipped with great shields and 10,000 horsemen was followed by 2,000 wagons transporting food and equipment. All the states of the Balkans at this time looked at this movement with apprehension. Ptolemy, the king of Macedonia, took the news of the Gauls casually. He looked down with derision on the proposal of the king of the Dardanians possibly Monunius who sent delegates to say that they could offer 20,000 warriors to assist him. In an insulting manner, he said that the work was for the Macedonians to do. When the king of the Dardanians was told of this, he replied that the soon glorious Macedonian kingdom would fall because of the immaturity of a youth. And so it happened, for in the battle that took place a few days later in Macedonia, the Macedonian army was routed and Ptolemy was wounded and taken prisoner. After continuing south and raiding the Delphi the Gallic army decided to return up north to their homeland but were all wiped out by the Dardanians, through which they had to pass.The Illyrians to the Albanians by Neritan Ceka – 2005 Illyrian wars In the First Illyrian War, which lasted from 229 BC to 228 BC,Wilkes, J.

It had originally been joined to Illyricum, but after the great Illyrian/Pannonian revolt of A.D. 6 it was made a separate province with its own governor.) was a major conflictThe Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 183, ...Pannonian Illyrians between Italy and the East. That could only be done at a great cost and not before a rebellion of Illyricum brought the regime of Augustus to the brink of disaster. between an alliance of Illyrian communities and the Roman forces that lasted for four years beginning in AD 6 and ending in AD 9. In AD 6, several regiments of Daesitiates, natives of area that now comprises central Bosnia and Herzegovina, led by Bato the Daesitiate (Bato I), were gathered in one place to prepare to join Augustus's stepson and senior military commander Tiberius in a war against the Germans. Instead, the Daesitiates mutinied and defeated a Roman force sent against them. The Daesitiates were soon joined by the BreuciWilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, p. 207, . The rising began among the Daesitiates of central Bosnia under their leader Bato but they were soon joined by the Breuci. The four-year war which lasted from AD 6 to 9 saw huge... led by Bato of the Breuci (Bato II), another community inhabiting the region between the rivers Sava and Drava in modern Croatia. They gave battle to a second Roman force from Moesia led by Caecina Severus (the governor of Moesia). Despite their defeat, they inflicted heavy casualties at the Battle of Sirmium. The rebels were now joined by a large number of other communities. At risk was the strategic province of Illyricum, recently expanded to include the territory of the Pannonii, an indigenous communities inhabiting the region between the rivers Drava and Sava, who were subjugated by Rome in 12–9 BC. Illyricum was on Italy's eastern flank, exposing the Roman heartland to the fear of a rebel invasion. Augustus ordered Tiberius to break off operations in Germany and move his main army to Illyricum. Tiberius sent Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus (the governor of Dalmatia and Pannonia) ahead with troops. The panic broke out in RomeVelleius Paterculus, 2.110–111; Dio Cassius, 55.30,1 and Augustus raised a second task force under Tiberius's nephew Germanicus. He resorted to the compulsory purchase and emancipation of thousands of slaves in order to amass enough troops. This happened for the first time since the aftermath of the Battle of Cannae two centuries earlier. At one moment, in winter AD 6/7, 10 legions were deployed and an equivalent number of auxilia (70 cohors, 10 ala and more than 10,000 veterans).Velleius Paterculus, Historia Romana 2.113. In addition, they were assisted by a large number of Thracian troops deployed by their King Rhoemetalces I, a Roman amicus (\\"ally\\") a grand total of some 100,000 men.Rhoemetalces's kingdom was later annexed by emperor Claudius.

It took them three years of hard fighting to quell the revolt, which was described by the Roman historian Suetonius as the most difficult conflict faced by Rome since the Punic Wars two centuries earlier. Tiberius finally quelled the revolt in AD 9. This was just in time: that same year Arminius destroyed Varus's three legions in Germany. The Roman high command did not doubt that Arminius would have formed a grand alliance with the Illyrians.Dio Cassius LV.29–34; Suetonius Tiberius 16, 17. The fighting of the Illyrian Revolt had lasting effects on Roman soldiers. Unhappy with their payment of swampy and mountainous Pannonian lands for such harsh military service, and with abuses relating to their pay and conditions, Roman soldiers staged a mutiny in AD 14 demanding recompense. Tiberius dispatched his son, Drusus, to pacify the mutineers. Tactics and troop organization Illyrians in ancient sources were known as brave and skilled fighters. The Illyrians appeared in war as free warriors under their rulers or kings. Similar to other societies the status of a leader was determined by the number of warriors who followed him. Obedience to a higher authority such as a king was channelled through the collective loyalty of a tribe to the chief. In historical sources they are described as a peasant infantry fighting under aristocratic proprietors (polydynastae) each one controlling a town within the kingdom. The Dalmatians were known to use Partisan tactics against the Romans which were successful in inflicting serious defeats on the best of the Roman legions. Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC) writes of the Illyrian military formation in this battle that was an attempt for a coordinated stance by forming a square.Diodorus Siculus, Library,16.4 His exact words are: \\"Ἰλλυριοὶ συντάξαντες ἑαυτούς εἰς πλινθίον ἐρρωμένος\\". > \\"But the Illyrians, forming themselves into a square, courageously entered > the fray. And at first for a long while the battle was evenly poised because > of the exceeding gallantry displayed on both sides, and as many were slain > and still more wounded, the fortune of battle vacillated first one way then > the other\\" In the 2nd century BC the army of Agron and Teuta is no more represented in phalanxes but in smaller troops, armoured well and fast moving. These tactics also used in Roman times were ready for independent operations and so were more effective than earlier phalanxes. These exact tactics were agile for quick and surprising actions and soon showed to be superior against Greek tactics and as a result the Illyrians achieved victories over the Greeks. On the sea the Illyrians used guerrilla tactics with their sophisticated navy. These sea tactics made the Illyrians masters of the Adriatic Sea for many centuries. Their ships, which were relatively small were not capable of direct naval battle with the heavier war-ships of the Greeks and Romans and most of the time were defeated. An exception is the victory over the island of Paxoi, where the Illyrians used a new form of tactic which involved connecting their ships in groups of four in order to attack Greek ships.. Weaponry The fact that Illyrian warriors were buried with their weapons has resulted in an abundant amount of surviving intact. The works of ancient authors fail to provide a clear picture on Illyrian weapons and the only true contributor to this matter was the Roman poet Ennius (239 BC – 169 BC) who was of Messapian origin. Weaponry was very important to the Illyrians in the time of war however sometimes only the rich and nobles could afford some types such as greaves and helmets. A lot of armour was imported to mainly from the Greek mainland proved by the findings of Greek weapons in the Glacinac graves dating from the 7th century BC. Shields were used among the Illyrians as early as the Bronze Age. In the Iron Age two types of shields were used, the Illyrian circular shield and the oval/rectangular type used by the northern Illyrians. The most common was the circular shield, which was made of wood and leather with a bronze boss and was like a mostly light pelte.The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 240 The Illyrian circular shield resembled the Macedonian version but differed from the number of circular decortication. Their shapes with either round (peltes), rectangular or oval. A type of wooden oblong shield with an iron boss was introduced to Illyria from the Celts.The Illyrians: history and culture, History and Culture Series, The Illyrians: History and Culture, Aleksandar Stipčević, , 1977, page 174, \\"Resembling the northern Illyrian oval shield was one introduced into Illyria by the Celts. Apart from the iron boss, nothing was preserved from these Celtic shields. It is known though that they were oblong shaped and made of wood with an umbo in the center...\\" This type of shield resembled the Illyrian oval shield used in northern Illyria. Breast-armour and greaves were a speciality for the rich only in Illyrian society. Bronze breast-armor was used very rarely by the northern Illyrians and only three examples have been discovered so far in Slovenia. However another form of body armor was a bronze pectoral that may have protected part of the back as well. It was more like a disc \\"breastplate\\" of 10 cm in diameter. Greaves to protect the legs were used from the 7th century BC and probably even earlier. They first appeared in Illyria from its southern borders and are found only in princely graves. Illyrian chariots from Vace – 6th century BC In northern Illyria the bronze helmet was employed. The bronze helmet developed into the common Conical helmet which sometimes contained a plume. The most intriguing of all Illyrian helmets developed, the Shmarjet helmet, was made by the Japodes in the Lika valley. It was made from wicker and chain-mail while metal plates around the sides were optional. Under influence from Illyria's northern neighbours, the Italic peoples, the Negau helmet was used from the 5th century BC to the 4th century BC. The most widespread helmet was the Illyrian helmet with its use beginning from the 7th century BC. The Illyrian helmet was made from bronze and consisted of a great, crested plume on the top. The origin and the time period this helmet used has been a subject of much debate. Some experts allocate its origins in Corinth and claim it went out of use in Illyria in the 4th century BC. Others claim that the helmet has its origins in Illyria and that it was used up to the 2nd century BC, proven by depictions on Illyrian city coins of the time. The principal sword of the Illyrians was the sica, a single-edged curved sword similar to the Greek machaira.The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 238, \\"Their principal offensive weapon was the single edged curved-sword, similar to the Greek machaira, a form of weapon that can be traced back to Bronze age times...\\" The sica was developed during the Bronze Age. The sica's blade was about long. It became widely used and adopted by other peoples such as the Thracians, Dacians and the Romans. The Illyrians also used the fighting sword short curved swords, long swords in addition to various knives. According to historian John Wilkes:The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 238-239, \\"Although a short curved sword was used by several peoples around the Mediterranean the Romans regarded the sica as a distinct Illyrian weapon used by the stealthy 'assassin' (sicarius)\\" > Although a short curved sword was used by several peoples around the > Mediterranean the Romans regarded the sica as a distinct Illyrian weapon > used by the stealthy 'assassin' (sicarius) The Illyrians also used a variety of other weapons, like javelins, long metallic spears called SibynaThe Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 239 (Ancient Greek Σιβύνη) that resembled boar spears,Illustrated Dictionary of Words Used in Art and Archeology by J. W. Mollett, , 2003, page 296, \\"Sibina, Sibyna, Gr. and R. σιβύνη. A kind of boar spear deployed in hunting\\" short thrusting spears, battle axes, single-handed axes that could be hurled and also bows and arrows which were used from the start of the 2nd millennium BC. Mercenaries Illyrians acted as mercenaries on several occasionsThe Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, , page 168, \\"Like Thracians to the east the Illyrians were an important source of military manpower, and often served as separate contingents under their own leaders...\\" whether on the side of the Greeks or the Romans. Perdiccas II of Macedon had hired Illyrian mercenaries in the 5th century BC but they betrayed him, allying with his enemy, Arrhabaeus of Lyncus. In another incident, Lysimachus killed all of his 5,000 Illyrian mercenaries (of the Autariatae tribe) to the last man, because he was convinced that they would join the enemy.The legacy of Alexander: politics, warfare, and propaganda under the successors, , 2002, page 248-249, \\"It concernes 5,000 Illyrian troops whose baggage Demetrius had captured 'in the battle around Lampsacus'. They had lost everything and Lysimachus was seriously worried they would mutiny. He therefore took preventive action, withdrew them from the front on the pretext of issuing their rations and killed them to the last man.\\" Previously in 302 BC 2,000 of his Illyrian mercenaries had defectedThe legacy of Alexander: politics, warfare, and propaganda under the successors, , 2002, page 249 to Antigonus. Illyrians were not considered as reliable mercenaries, in the ancient worldThe legacy of Alexander: politics, warfare, and propaganda under the successors, , 2002, page 248, \\"The Illyrians moreover had not been reliable auxiliaries in the recent past\\" but were at the same time acknowledged as a skilled fighting force Nobility Illyrian king or noble, 500 BC – 100 BC The nobility had access to breastplates and greaves whilst the bulk of the army did not. The kings did not resemble the rest of the army and were the only ones with full body protection which was a rarity.Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, , page 240, \\"Body armour, breastplates [...] greaves and helmets were the privilege of a minority with a few examples of full body protection being known only in the Dolensko region of Slovenia.\\" Illyrian kings and rulers wore bronze torques around their necksThe Illyrians by J. J. Wilkes, 1992, , page 223, \\"Illyrian chiefs wore heavy bronze torques\\" and were heavily armoured in antithesis to the bulk of their armies. A number of weapons and armaments were imported from GreeceWilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, , page 54, \\"A double edged Greek sword and two pairs of greaves also imports were recovered \\" including helmets.Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, , page 54, \\"there were imported helmets Corinthian type and an early version of the 'GraecoIllyrian helmet'\\" Armaments were mostly made of bronze.The Cambridge Ancient History, Cambridge University Press, , 2000, page 261. Another form of body armour was a bronze pectoralGreece and Rome at War by Peter Connolly, , 2006 (that may have protected part of the back as well). It was more like a disc \\"breastplate\\" of 10 cm in diameter. Local greaves made of bronze were strapped on the legs.The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, , page 42, \\"Chieftain burial\\" Metal riveted belts were used as well. Illyrian navy The Illyrians were notorious sailors in the ancient world. They were great ship builders and seafarers. The most skilful Illyrian sailors were the Liburnians, Japodes, Delmatae and Ardiaei. The greatest navy was built by Agron in the 3rd century BC. The Illyrian tactics consisted of lashing their galleys together in groups of four and inviting a broadside attack from a ram. The Illyrians would then board the enemy craft in overwhelming numbers. Illyrian war ships were adopted by many peoples especially the Greeks and Romans. Illyrian craftsmen were even hired by the King of Macedon to build 100 ships in the First Macedonian War because to him they bore a special gift of ship building. The earliest evidence of Illyrian ships is from the design of a ship incised on bronze greaves from Glasinac dating from the 8th century BC to the 7th century BC. The front of this ship is constructed in the form of an animal probably a horse. Illyrian ships were a favourite depiction on Illyrian coins especially on the coinage of the Labatae. The type of war ships presented on the coins is hard to determine. However, all the depictions show a similarity in which the bows of the ships were shaped in the form of a serpents head. The Byzantine author from the 6th century wrote that the Adriatic was a sea in which serpents swam.left The Liburnians were renowned seafarers dominating the Adriatic and Ionian Sea from the start of the 1st millennium to the 5th century BC. The Romans knew them principally as a people addicted to piracy. The major harbour of Liburnian navy since the 5th century BC was Corynthia at eastern cape of Krk island, including 7 unearthed docks, marine arsenal, and stony fortifications; this early harbour persisted in ancient and medieval function to the 16th century. Liburnians constructed different ship types; their galaia was an early prototype of transport galleys, lembus was a fishing shipHans Krahe, Die Sprache der Illyrier, I. Teil, Wiesbaden, 1955, p. 114.H. Krahe, Griech. λέμβος, lat. lembus – eine illyrische Schiffsbezeichnung?, Gymnasium, 59/1952, H. 1, p. 79.L. Casson, Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World, Princeton, 1971, pp. 141–142. continued by the actual Croatian levut, and a drakoforos was apparently mounted with a dragon head at the prow. Remains of a 10 meters long ship from the 1st century BC, were found in Zaton near Nin (Aenona in Classical Liburnia), a ship keel with bottom planking made of 6 rows of the wooden boards on each side, specifically joined together, sewn with resin cords and wooden wedges, testifying the Liburnian shipbuilding tradition style, therefore named \\"Serilia Liburnica\\". Deciduous trees (oak and beech) were used, while some climber was used for the cords. The Illyrians were often referred to as pirates, raiding Greek and Roman vessels. Illyrian's indulgence in piracy was one that brought them infamy and invited their downfall. Their rugged broken coast with its screen of islands formed a perfect base from which their light and speedy little to attack unwary ships. The Illyrians piratical career reached its zenith under Queen Teuta. The Illyrians practised boarding tactics against enemy vessels. Although this view was widely accepted at first this connection is not completely true. Ancient Greek and Roman authors often attacked Illyrians in their works merely because they saw them as enemies and so many sources may be heavily exaggerated. The three main types of Illyrian warships were the Lembus, the Liburna and the Pristis.The Greek State at War, William Kendrick Pritchett, , 1991, page 76, \\"Similarly the pirates on the Illyrian coast are said to have developed vessels that were named after their tribes, the lembus, pristis and liburna\\" =Lembus= The lembos (from , \\"boat\\",λέμβος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus romanized as lembus), was an ancient Illyrian warship, with a single bank of oars and no sails. It was small and light, with a low freeboard. It was a fast and manoeuvrable warship capable of carrying 50 men in addition to the rowers.Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, , page 157, Polybius, 2.3.Casson (1995), p. 162 It was most commonly associated with the vessels used by the Illyrian tribes, chiefly for piracy, in the area of Dalmatia.Casson (1995), p. 125 This type of craft was also adopted by Philip V of Macedon, and soon after by the Seleucids, Rome, and even the Spartan king Nabis in his attempt to rebuild the Spartan navy.Casson (1995), pp. 125–126 In contemporary authors, the name was associated with a class rather than a specific type of vessels, as considerable variation is evident in the sources: the number of oars ranged from 16 to 50, they could be one- or double-banked, and some types did not have a ram, presumably being used as couriers and fast cargo vessels.Casson (1995), p. 126 =Liburna= Romanized Liburna during Trajan's Dacian Wars. The most known Liburnian ship was their warship, known as a libyrnis to the Greeks and a liburna to the Romans, propelled by oars. According to some thoughts, liburna was shown in the scene of naval battle, curved on a stone tablet (Stele di Novilara) found near Antique Pisaurum (Pesaro), outlined to 5th or 6th century BC, the most possibly showing imaginary battle between Liburnian and Picenian fleets. Liburna was presented as light type of the ship with one row or the oars, one mast, one sail and prow twisted outwards. Under the prow there was a rostrum made for striking the enemy ships under the sea. By its original form, the Liburna was the most similar to the Greek penteconter. It had one bench with 25 oars on each side, while in the late ages of the Roman Republic, it became a smaller version of a trireme, but with two banks of oars (a bireme), faster, lighter, and more agile than biremes and triremes. The Liburnian design was adopted by the Romans and became a key part of Ancient Rome's navy, most possibly by mediation of Macedonian navy in the 2nd half of the 1st century BC. Liburna ships played a key role in naval battle of Actium in Greece, which lasted from August 31 to September 2 of 31 BC. Because of its naval and manoeuvrer features and bravery of its Liburnian crews, these ships completely defeated much bigger and heavier eastern ships, quadriremes and penterames. Liburna was different from the battle triremes, quadriremes and quinqueremes not because of rowing but rather because of its specific constructional features.C.G. Starr Jr., The Roman Imperial Navy 31 B.C. – A.D. 324, West-port, Connecticut 1975, page 54M. Zaninović, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43–67 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13)>>65<<, pages 46, 47 It was long and wide with a draft. Two rows of oarsmen pulled 18 oars per side. The ship could make up to 14 knots under sail and more than 7 under oars. Such a vessel, used as a merchantman, might take on a passenger, as Lycinus relates in the 2nd-century dialogue, traditionally attributed to Lucian of Samosata: \\"I had a speedy vessel readied, the kind of bireme used above all by the Liburnians of the Ionian Gulf.\\" Once the Romans had adopted the Liburnian, they proceeded to make a few adaptations to improve the ships’ use within the navy. The benefits gained from the addition of rams and protection from missiles more than made-up for the slight loss of speed.Morrison, J. S., and J. F. Coates. 1996. Greek and Roman Warships 399-30 B.C. Oxford. pgs 170, 317. Besides the construction, the ships required that the regular Roman military unit be simplified in order to function more smoothly. Each ship operated as an individual entity, so the more complicated organization normally used was not necessary.C. G. Starr, The Roman Imperial Navy 31 BC-AD 324, 3rd ed., Chicago, 1993, p. 59. Within the navy, there were probably Liburnian of several varying sizes, all put to specific tasks such as scouting and patrolling Roman waters against piracy.J. S. Morrison and J. F. Coates, Greek and Roman Warships 399-30 B.C., Oxford, 1996, p. 317.

Gradually liburna became general name for the different types of the Roman ships, attached also to the cargo ships in the Late Antique. Tacitus and Suetonius were using it as a synonym for the battle ship. In inscriptions it was mentioned as the last in class of the battle ships: hexeres, penteres, quadrieres, trieres, liburna.M.

Most enclosures were round or oval with very few exceptions for other shapes and the largest two were 200 meters across while most are not anything more than fortified blockhouses. The Castellieri were fortified boroughs, usually located on hills or mountains or, more rarely (such as in Friuli), in plains. They were constituted by one or more concentric series of walls, of rounded or elliptical shape in Istria and Venezia Giulia, or quadrangular in Friuli, within which was the inhabited area. Some a hundred of castellieri have been discovered in Istria, Friuli and Venezia Giulia, such as that of Leme, in the central-western Istria, of the Elleri, near Muggia, of Monte Giove near Prosecco (Trieste) and San Polo, not far from Monfalcone. However, the largest castelliere was perhaps that of Nesactium, in the southern Istria, not far from Pula. External influences =Hellenistic influence= Illyrian helmet from Argolis. 6–5th century BC The graves of Illyrian nobles (early Iron Age, 7th century BC – 5th century BC) contained a great number of Greek imports including weaponry.European Journal of Archeology volume 5(1);70–88,Sage publications and European association of Archeologists(1461-9571-2002045:1;70-88;0221771) This includes finds at Glasinac (Bosnia and Herzegovina), Lake Ohrid in North Macedonia, Dolensko in Slovenia and various sites in Albania. The Glasinac culture encompasses eastern Bosnia, south-western Serbia, Montenegro and northern Albania. Ancient Greek Illyrian type helmets either as imports or later copies had spread throughout Illyria and one was found as far as Slovenia (though again in the grave of a king) not only in the Glasinac cultural area like the helmet found in the grave at Klicevo, Montenegro.

A typical adoption of the symbol in the Hellenistic period from Illyrians is seen on an iron round pelte with similar decorations and a diameter of 35 cm.

It belonged to the Hellenistic civilization and sphere of the Greek culture. Its 46 meters of the old fortress are preserved\\" =Roman= Illyria became a Roman province at 168 BC. The Illyrians, that were eventually Romanized rebelled in AD 6. Nearly two hundred years of Roman rule changed the weapons of the Illyrians by the time of the rebellion and they resembled those of Roman legionaries. The tribes that rebelled had been Celticized by the time Romans conquered Illyria in 168 BC and their equipment reflected this. Inhabitants of Roman Dalmatia applied a poison on their arrows called ninum.The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, , page 222 This was not a Roman influence but was mentioned during that time.

It stands four km north west of the city centre on Middlewood Road across from Hillsborough Park at grid reference . The church has a website and can be viewed at the address, www.hillsboroughtrinity.org.uk .  History  The church was built at the beginning of the 20th century by John W. Firth to cater to the increasing population as it expanded into the countryside around Sheffield. The site was purchased from J. Willis Dixon of Hillsborough Hall (now Hillsborough library) in December 1898 for £547. An “Iron Church” was erected on nearby Leader road and was used for temporary worship while the church was being built. Hillsborough Trinity was designed in the Gothic style and cost £5,500, opening on 1 September 1902. The church was originally designated as Methodist New Connexion, one of the many factions of the original Wesleyan Methodist church, it merged into the main Methodist Church of Great Britain in 1932. Methodism reached its peak at the beginning of the 20th century when there were eight Methodist churches in the Hillsborough area. However, Hillsborough Trinity is the only one remaining, as the other seven have been demolished or now being used for other purposes. The church has changed very little externally over the years, although a new church hall was added in 1963. The interior of the church has been modified to cater for the needs of modern worship, the original balcony is now not used because of safety concerns.\\"The Complete Hillsborough by her people\\", Mick Drewry, Pages 59 Gives historical information.  Present day and future  The church has extensive adjoining buildings (AD 1901 and 1963) which are still used for Sunday School as well as Brownies, Boys' Brigade as well as many other community events such as coffee mornings, Polly's Parlour (community cafe), toddler groups, craft group, lunch club and other community group meetings. The church is undergoing extensive structural work for the future to make the church a major community building. The plans, form three phases, with phase one having completed in 2014. Phase two began in January 2015 to create a new entrance to church, the church office and improved toilet and shower facilities.\\"Profile Hillsborough\\" (Magazine) Gives details of history present day and future. Previous refurbishments includes the hall's stage being removed to extend the space; the size of the kitchen was increased by moving the wall separating it from the beginners room. As well as a re-size, the kitchen had a full new fit out of equipment and work-surfaces. Two new rooms were added in the loft space above what was the stage. and the whole of the church was re-painted.  Youth Groups  The 20th Sheffield Company - Boys Brigade is based at the church and runs the Anchor, Junior, Company and Senior Sections on Thursday evenings. Scouts, Cubs and Beavers meet on a Monday evening and Guides, Brownies and Rainbows meet on a Tuesday evening. In addition to this, regular church services for the Uniformed Groups (i.e. Boys Brigade, Guides, Scouts et al.) are held throughout the year.

Published anonymously in 1953 under Edmonds' nickname, which was coined by a lover who likened her to \\"the sleek body and class of his Cadillac motorcar\\", Caddie attracted wide critical acclaim upon its original publication in London, and became a bestseller when it was adapted into a feature film in 1976, one year after International Women's Year.  Author and origins  The book's anonymous author, Catherine Beatrice Edmonds (1900–1960), was employed for some years from 1945 as a charwoman by authors Dymphna Cusack and Florence James at their cottage in the Blue Mountains. At the time, Cusack and James were working on their epic collaborative novel, Come In Spinner. Edmonds initially took the job in the hope that the authors would write her story. Entertained by Edmonds' turn of phrase and her stories of working as a barmaid during the Depression, Cusack and James encouraged and coached her through seven drafts of an autobiography until 1952.Dymphna Cusack, 'Introduction' in Caddie: The Autobiography of a Sydney Barmaid (1953). Edmonds married Frederick George Holloway (represented as 'Jon Marsh' in the book) on 25 January 1919 at St Stephen's Church, Newtown. The couple had two children in the early years of the marriage: a son named Ronald, and a daughter named Catherine. The couple were divorced in Sydney on 20 December 1929. She married again on 24 February 1934 to Arthur John Baden Surenne at the Methodist Church at Marrickville. This marriage lasted until 1948 when the couple divorced. She later changed her surname by deed poll to Elliott-Mackay. Edmonds chose to write under a pseudonym because she was publicity-shy. John Ritchie's entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography describes her as plump, round-faced, with \\"narrow, grey-blue eyes, 'wavy, light brown hair streaked with grey', and deeply-graven lines at the corners of her mouth\\". Caddie Edmonds died of a heart attack on 16 April 1960 at her home in Regentville in Sydney. She was buried in Penrith General Cemetery and was survived by a son and a daughter.John Ritchie, Edmonds, Catherine Beatrice (Caddie) (1900–1960) Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 14, Melbourne University Press, 1996, pp 79-80, online:  Plot summary  The book tells the story of Caddie, starting with her birth in Penrith, New South Wales, in 1900 to a family living in poverty. They move to railway camps at Glenbrook in the Blue Mountains where her drunken father works as a railway fettler. His abuse becomes worse when her mother dies in childbirth and her brother is killed at the Gallipoli landing. To escape her family, she moves to Sydney to work as a shop assistant with her friend, Esther, while still a young woman. She meets and marries a middle-class man, Jon Marsh, and has two children by him. She feels constrained by the control taken by her mother-in- law, living next door, who treats her as undeserving of her son, as Caddie is not \\"pure merino\\" (i.e., with only free-settler, not convict, forebears). Caddie leaves when she discovers Jon's sexual relationship with Esther. Jon and his mother endeavour to retain custody of the children, although Caddie believes this is really only to spite her. Caddie moves to the first available cheap accommodation, only to find that the premises are mainly inhabited by prostitutes. Caddie finds better-paid work as a barmaid, a morally suspect position—her first employer tells her to shorten her dress, for example, because \\"she was an artwork, and he liked his artwork on display.\\" She places her children in the care of a church-run home, having tried leaving them with carers who mistreated and neglected them. She visits weekly, often with her barmaid friend, Leslie. When the Depression hits, tips are less common and both women's incomes fall dramatically. Through Leslie, Caddie meets a Greek immigrant and business owner, Peter, with whom she establishes a loving relationship, with Peter buying gifts for weekend visits with Caddie's children. Caddie and Peter are distressed when Peter's estranged wife and ailing father call him back to Greece to run the family business. The couple corresponds, with Peter reporting that his attempts to divorce his wife have been unsuccessful. With the effects of the Depression deepening, Caddie takes additional work by running tabs for the pub's SP bookmaker. She regains custody of her children and rents a house, furnishing it with fruit cases for chairs. She befriends Bill \\"the Rabbittoh\\" (rabbit seller), Sonny his brother and their parents, and Bill helps her sign up for the dole (sustenance food provisions meant for those without income). Caddie saves some money when she starts running the SP books herself, the bookmaker having moved on to legal bookmaking at the racecourse. Caddie decides to leave the city, having been offered work on a farm. She moves house to share with Bill the rabbittoh for a week, to save rent before moving to mountains for other work, but remains there when the work offer is withdrawn. She emotionally supports, and is supported by, Bill's family, including caring for his elderly father before his death. Around this time, Peter's wife dies, and Peter asks Caddie to migrate. Caddie feels unable to do this, but Peter is tied to Greece to keep the business alive. The story ends in tragedy when Peter returns, following the death of his wife, and the couple is finally able to make plans to marry. When he buys a new car, he takes the whole family driving and dies in a tragic car crash when swerving to avoid collision with a truck, only four days before their planned wedding. Caddie makes a chance reacquaintance with Esther, who has been deserted by John, and has contracted tuberculosis. Against her wishes, Caddie's son enlists at the outbreak of World War II. Bill and Sonny go \\"on the wallaby track\\", searching remote areas for subsistence work.  Characters  Caddie - central character and first person author, whose true name is not revealed in the book Terry - Caddie's son Anne - Caddie's daughter Esther - Caddie's friend Leslie - friend, barmaid Jon Marsh - Caddie's husband, estranged for much of the story Ted - SP Bookie for whom Caddie keeps tabs Peter - Caddie's Greek immigrant lover Bill \\"the Rabbitoh\\" - friend and supporter in latter phase of story Sonny - brother of Bill  Major themes  The book documents one woman's version of her experiences of the Great Depression, highlighting her battle to maintain her respectability while ensuring she can support her children. At the time, Australian bars were segregated on gender lines, so the barmaid was the only female present in the main bar. As a result, barmaids had a bad name because a woman working in such conditions was regarded as morally suspect, perhaps luring men into spending their money in bars, perhaps soliciting commercial sex. Indeed, Caddie makes reference to the numerous sexual advances made towards her, both in her role as barmaid and in situations where it would benefit her, such as from the teacher at her children's school. She shows how she remained morally respectable in this regard, and shows how her other illegal activities - SP bookmaking, signing up for multiple welfare payments - were for the benefit of her family and friends. The story makes reference to the six o'clock swill, written at a time shortly after the war when it was presumed that the reader would be familiar with the phenomenon. In an effort to minimise alcohol consumption, the Australian government legislated that bars were to close at 6pm. The result was an extreme rush between 5pm and 6pm. Cusack notes how Caddie was reluctant to give any signs of complaint, but to take everything in her stride in order to meet the needs of her children. Cusack had Caddie rewrite the book several times in order to give more detail of the difficulties she faced and her feelings about them. The stoic strength of an Australian single woman \\"battler\\" is an underlying theme to the story.  Publishing details  The book was published in May 1953 by Constable & Co. Ltd in London to glowing reviews. By September it had been reprinted three times, although, at this stage, it was not a best seller. It was eventually published in Australia in 1966. The film adaptation in 1976 led to a resurgence in the book's popularity and bestseller status, with seven reprints that year, sixteen years after Caddie's death.  Film adaptation  Adapted for film in 1976, the film Caddie was a commercial and critical success, making nearly A$3m on a budget of A$400,000, and winning a San Sebastian Film Festival award. It was produced by Anthony Buckley and supported by, among other organisations, the International Women's Year Secretariat and Australian Film Commission’s Women's Film Fund. It launched the careers of Jacki Weaver as Josie and Helen Morse in the title role of Caddie for which she won the AFI Best Actress award. It also starred Takis Emmanuel as Peter, Jack Thompson as Ted, Melissa Jaffer as Leslie, Ron Blanchard as Bill and Drew Forsythe as Sonny. The screenplay skips Caddie's impoverished early life, implying she was from a middle-class background.

After World War II, by the establishment of the French Fourth Republic in 1947, Dahomey became part of the French Union with an increased autonomy. On 11 December 1958, the French Fifth Republic was established and the French Union became the French Community. The colony became the self- governing Republic of Dahomey within the Community, and two years later on 1 August 1960, it gained full independence (and in 1975 changed its name to Benin). History ;Kingdom of Dahomey During the 13th century, the indigenous Yoruba people of the west Niger area were run by a group of local chieftains, but by the 15th century a single ruler known as the 'oba' had asserted control, creating the Kingdom of Dahomey. Under the dynasty established by Ewuare the Great, the most famous of the obas, Dahoney's territory expanded to cover a region between the Niger River delta and what is now the Nigerian city of Lagos. The obas brought great prosperity and a highly organized state to Benin. They also established good relations and an extensive slave trade with the Portuguese and Dutch who arrived from the 15th century onwards. The decline of the obas began in the 18th century when a series of internal power struggles began which lasted into the 19th century. ;Colony The French takeover and colonization of the Kingdom of Dahomey began in 1872. The First Franco-Dahomean War in 1890 further weakened it. The Second Franco-Dahomean War resulted in it becoming a French protectorate in 1894. A decree dated 22 June 1894 created the Colonie du Dahomey et dépendances (Colony of Dahomey and Dependencies), which was to be incorporated into French West Africa in 1904. Under the French, a port was constructed at Cotonou, and railroads were built. School facilities were expanded by Roman Catholic missions. In 1946, Dahomey became an overseas territory with its own parliament and representation in the French national assembly. On 4 December 1958, it became the Republic of Dahomey (République du Dahomey), self- governing within the French Union. ;Independence On 1 August 1960, the Republic of Dahomey gained full independence from France. The republic's first president was Hubert Maga, who had been the Prime Minister during the overseas territory's last year under French rule.

Prior to attaining autonomy it had been French Dahomey, part of the French Union. On August 1, 1960, it attained full independence from France. In 1975, the country was renamed Benin after the Bight of Benin (which was in turn named after the Benin Empire which had its seat of power in Benin City, modern-day Nigeria), since \\"Benin\\" was deemed politically neutral for all ethnic groups in the state, whereas \\"Dahomey\\" recalled the Fon-dominated Kingdom of Dahomey. History The Republic of Dahomey became independent of France on 1 August 1960. In the words of the historian Martin Meredith, the young country \\"was encumbered with every imaginable difficulty: a small strip of territory jutting inland from the coast, it was crowded, insolvent and beset by tribal divisions, huge debts, unemployment, frequent strikes and an unending struggle for power between three rival political leaders\\". These rivals were Justin Ahomadégbé- Tomêtin, who held sway in the southern and central regions of the country, Sourou-Migan Apithy, who dominated the southeast, and Hubert Maga, whose power base was located in the north. Upon independence, Maga became the first president of Dahomey. A political crisis in 1958, prior to independence, had led to Maga's Dahomeyan Democratic Movement joining a coalition government, with a subsequent crisis leading to Maga becoming the head of government in April 1959. This compromise, however, was unable to solve Dahomey's problems, and an uprising broke out in October 1963, culminating in a coup d'état, and the replacement of Maga as president with Apithy. This also failed to bring about stability, and Apithy was removed in another coup, in December 1965. Following the 1965 coup, Colonel Christophe Soglo became president. A veteran of the French Army, he saw himself as a Dahomeyan Charles de Gaulle, banning all political activity with the stated aim of stabilising the country. Civilian rule was in fact restored in 1968, but the tumult of the preceding years meant that the army remained a key player in Dahomeyan politics, with civilian presidents beholden to their military backers. In October 1972, a coup (the fifth in the country's history) led by Mathieu Kérékou removed a civilian government (which had been headed by a triumvirate consisting of Ahomadégbé, Apithy and Maga). Kérékou would go on to proclaim his support for Marxism-Leninism, declaring the end of the Republic of Dahomey and the establishment of the People's Republic of Benin on 30 November 1975. In film Dahomey was chosen for some of the filming locations in the film The Comedians, with an all-star cast that included Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Lillian Gish, James Earl Jones, Roscoe Lee Brown, Alec Guinness, Raymond St. Jacques, Gloria Foster, Zakes Mokae, Paul Ford, Georg Stanford Brown, Peter Ustinov, Douta Seck and Cicely Tyson. The movie is the story of an adulterous affair placed against the backdrop of Haiti during the tumultuous dictatorship of François Duvalier, (known as \\"Papa Doc\\"). Dahomey resembled Haiti in many ways, both geographically and culturally, and it was safer to film there than in Haiti.

Perez was known for singing traditional décimas, a traditional narrative song which is sung in ten line stanzas. The origins of many of Perez's songs could be traced to Spain and the Canary Islands during the Middle Ages. Other decimas were written by Perez to preserve the distinct Isleño language and culture in Louisiana. Perez was considered the best décima singer in the Western Hemisphere. He was also one of the United States' and the world's few remaining native speakers of the Isleños dialect. The Isleños dialect is a combination of old formal Spanish, 18th-century maritime Spanish and influences of Louisiana's better known Cajun French. Perez, like other Isleños, was a direct descendant of Canary Islanders who settled in St. Bernard Parish in southern Louisiana in the late 18th century. Early life Perez was born on December 29, 1923. He was a native of Delacroix Island, Louisiana, where he grew up with both his nuclear and extended family. He spoke very little English until he began attending grade school. His grandfather, Mimiro Perez, lost over $9,000 when the banks went out of business during the Great Depression. Perez's father, Serafin Perez, taught him how to sing the traditional décimas and to carve decoy ducks. Perez's carvings were used in hunting, as well as art. Serafin Perez lost his home, as well as eighty decoys, when Hurricane Betsy devastated Louisiana in 1965. When World War II broke out, Perez dropped out of high school and enlisted in the United States Army. He served in the Pacific during the war and returned to southern Louisiana after it ended. He found work at the Kaiser Aluminum factory in Chalmette, Louisiana, from 1950 to 1975. He later earned his high school general equivalency degree. Décimas In addition to his father's oral traditions, Perez learned some of the décima songs through five local Isleño Louisiana dance halls. The dance halls would often allow the singing of traditional décimas in between other musical genres. The subjects of Perez's décimas varied widely, ranging from lost love to hurricanes to fishing to the plight of modern Isleños culture. Perez was considered by experts to be the world's best singer of the traditional décima. Researchers and music experts visited Perez's home in Delacroix Island from around the world in order to study the Isleño language, décimas, and culture. Among Perez's more noted researchers was Samuel Armistead of the University of California, Davis, who documented and recorded his Old and New Worlds décimas, whose origins ranged from 16th-century Spain and the Canary Islands to the 20th-century Louisiana Bayou. He was also often visited by Canarian and Spanish researchers, sociologists and cultural anthropologists who were interested in Perez's efforts to preserve his culture through his music. Perez, who was known for his high pitched, tenor voice, which many believed was perfect for singing décimas, performed at many well known events throughout the United States during his career. He was featured in the 1999 PBS series River of Song: A Musical Journey. Audio recordings of his songs are kept at the Louisiana Division of the Arts' Folklife in Education Project. Perez performed at the Wolf Trap National Folk Festival, Carnegie Hall and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. In addition to his décima, Perez was an expert woodcarver of decoys and realistic looking songbirds and water fowl from cypress roots. Many of his works were sold to support his family, while others have been displayed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Honors Perez was a recipient of a 1991 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. Later life Perez performed his décimas for King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofía of Spain during their visit to Jackson, Mississippi in 2001. The Spanish Monarchs were in Mississippi to visit \\"The Majesty of Spain\\" art exhibit at the time. Perez also made several trips to the Canary Islands over the years, where he was often honored by both residents and the government of the islands. He also served as the president of the Canary Island Descendants Association. Perez's wife, Louise Perez, whom he had been married to for 64 years, died on June 7, 2005, shortly before Hurricane Katrina struck the state. Louise was a well known expert in Isleño cuisine. Perez lost his home when Hurricane Katrina devastated Louisiana that same year. He also lost irreplaceable recordings of his father's songs, as well as most of his woodworking tools. Perez remained active in the arts until the end of his life. He sang at a public concert just three weeks before his death and carved one of his ducks the day he died. He suffered a heart attack at his home in Poydras, Louisiana. He died later that day at the age of 85 at Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans on January 8, 2008. His funeral was held on January 11, at St. Bernard Catholic Church in Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana. Perez's funeral mass was the first held at the church since its restoration following Hurricane Katrina. Perez was buried in St. Bernard Catholic Cemetery. He was survived by four daughters, 10 grandchildren, 14 great-grandchildren and a great-great-granddaughter. Perez was one of the last of the Isleños décimas singers. There are a few dozen native Isleños speakers left in Louisiana, but almost no one in the community can sing the décimas. The government of the Canary Islands declared Perez the \\"last of the decima singers\\" following his death and dedicated a memorial Mass to him in January 2008.

Nicola was a Cleveland businessman who moved to Pittsburgh in the 1890s. In 1898, Nicola opened Hotel Schenley (now William Pitt Union). In the early 20th century he promoted and developed a civic center plan for the Oakland district of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania--miles away from the city's smokey, congested downtown--as a new center for culture, art, and education. The plan was inspired by the City Beautiful movement. Nicola had been key in the formation of the Bellefield Company with the help of Pittsburgh businessmen Andrew W. Mellon, Henry Clay Frick, Andrew Carnegie, George Westinghouse and H.J. Heinz, who were among the first stockholders. The Oakland plan unfolded on land once owned by fellow stockholder Mary Croghan Schenley.

They reformed in 2015. History The band was formed in late 1979 by Dave Carson (vocals), Graeme High (guitar), Dougie Barrie (bass), and Stuart Wright (drums). Showing influences from the likes of Gang of Four and The Pop Group, they signed to the Pop Aural label for their eponymous debut single, receiving airplay from John Peel. In the next two years, the band had more line-up changes than releases, first with ex-Shake and Rezillos drummer Angel Paterson replacing Wright, to be replaced himself by Jamo Stewart and Dickie Fusco. Former Thursdays guitarist Mike Barclay then replaced High, who joined Delta 5. The band also added ex-Shake/Rezillos guitarist Jo Callis for second single \\"Rain Song\\", issued in March 1981. Callis then left to join The Human League, with no further line-up changes before third single \\"Ooh Bop Sh'Bam\\" was released in early 1982. Barrie then departed, his replacement being ex-Flowers/Shake/Rezillos bassist Simon Templar (b. Bloomfield), and ex-Josef K drummer Ronnie Torrance replaced the departing Fusco and Stewart (the latter forming The Syndicate). The band split up later in 1982. Between line-up changes, the band recorded two sessions for John Peel's BBC radio show, in 1980 and 1981. In 2015 they reformed and released The Undisco Kidds, an album of recordings from the 1980s.

Early life Stokell was born at Prebbleton, near Christchurch, New Zealand, on 20 June 1890 to Edmund Stokell and Jane (Née Pasche). He lived there for his whole life. He attended Broadfields Primary School, and was a keen trout angler. Interest in freshwater fish A keen angler, Stokell wrote a series of studies on trout in Lake Ellismere. Through this interest in angling, he also came across native fish species, but was unable to identify them due to a lack of published information. From 1938 onwards he began publishing papers on them, describing species and detangling the many names that had accrued.

Her advice proves wise, and by the time the children are grown, the family is on its way to prosperity. Harry (Striker), the elder son and mother's favorite, gives her the affection she craves, but she cannot see his shallowness, deceit, and general unworthiness. John (Helton), both as a child and when grown, suffers for his brothers sins, at last taking the blame for his brother's thefts from the factory. Harry drives his sister Ruth (Thomas) from home because he does not want her to marry a working man, this after their father has died on Christmas Day while all the family was together, his wife telling him of the happiness he has given her. Mrs. Webb takes over the management of the Webb shop, and has the help of John and Uncle Andrew, but Harry is lazy, extravagant, and generally caddish. Ruth and John are both driven away by Harry, but the mother carries on until she discovers that Harry has forged her name and taken or lost everything ov value. Anna breaks down and sells what is left, and after Harry runs off, she becomes a wandering derelict. After she is struck by an automobile, John and Ruth come to her, bringing Ruth's child.

The program first broadcast in the 1980s whenever BBC NI took over international football from UTV who used to show highlights, with the matches on BBC NI there was more Live action and highlights than before. The coverage was hosted by BBC NI sports presenters at the time including John Bennett and commentary was often done by Mark Robson. Jackie Fullerton became main commentator in 1993 whenever he moved to BBC NI from UTV with Mark Robson going in the opposite direction. Coverage declined in the 2008/2009 season with Northern Irelands home games on Sky Sports who bought the rights in 2008 and away games on Setanta Sports. That season the program has been limited to Northern Ireland highlights of all games, the Home highlights were shown on the night of the game and away highlights on the night after the game due to right restrictions. The only Northern Ireland match this season shown live on MOTD from NI was between San Marino and Northern Ireland in a 3-0 win for Northern Ireland. MOTD from NI also covers the Co-Operative Insurance Cup and JJB Sports Cup Finals live on BBC NI and the Milk Cup. The JJB Sports Cup has been shown live since 2000 and Co-Operative Insurance Cup since 2006 and the Milk Cup finals night has been shown since 2005. For the 2009/2010 the coverage will again increase because of the collapse of Setanta Sports.

They are frequently made of polyester and/or cotton. Crocheted pot-holders can be made out of cotton yarn as a craft project/folk art. A pot-holder offers protection for only one hand at a time. To lift a pan with two hot handles using both hands, two pot-holders are needed. For holding a hot piece of equipment, the pot-holder is folded around it and grasped with the hand. Generally a rubber surface will be on one side to grip and a fabric side to absorb the heat on the other side. When made of textile fabric, pot-holders typically have an inner layer of a material providing thermal insulation sandwiched between more colorful or decorative outsides. The most common type commercially available nowadays has the form of a square, with a side length varying from to and slightly rounded corners, and a textile loop at one of the corners for hanging.  Cultural uses  Throughout the pot-holder's lifetime, it has also been used as a representative symbol of various cultural movements. During the United States Abolitionist Movement, they were displayed by women who wanted to show their support for the Abolitionist cause. These provided women with some way to casually identify as part of the Abolitionist Movement without overtly expressing such. Additionally, it is sometimes used by Cajun cultures as part of their Mardi Gras masks. During the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the interred Japanese created several pot-holders out of various colored fabrics in order to reflect their own culture. This was done to break up the monotony, as the colorful nature of the crafts was in stark contrast to the generally bland surroundings of the camps.  Style development  The earliest records of pot-holders in the United States stem from the early 1900s, when pot-holders were made out of lace, as well as crocheted and embroidered. The usage of lace fell away at the same time as the popularization of geometric patterns on pot-holders, lasting up until the late 1970s. At the same time, applique methods began to become popularly used around the 1960s, and remained the most popular method, alongside of quilting up through the 1970s to the present.  Materials  The textile potholder was nonexistent in art or writing until around the 19th century. Evidence in art points towards hooks that were used to carry hot- handled pots in ancient Greece, but it wasn't until the Antislavery Bazaars of the mid-19th century that equivocally the first home-made potholders were made. These crafts were illustrated with various designs and advertised the phrase 'Any holder but a Slave Holder.\\" By creating such a political craft, which shares similar dimensions and fabrication with the contemporary potholder, women who may have never associated with the abolitionist movement had the opportunity to do so. The popularity of potholders is concomitant with the rise in proliferation of magazines. In these magazines, patterns were given for 'teapot holders' which strongly resemble potholders. Insulation capability was limited in early models. Since their genesis as standard household items, potholders have been largely associated with home crafting, and crocheting has long been the leading method in this strain followed by knitting and patchwork. Needlework patterns in the 1950s were often impractical and over-designed with holes and elaborate spacing that would burn the user or wear out the holder quickly. In the 1970s, quilting and applique- made potholder patterns gained popularity, enduring into the present day.  Safety  Pot-holders are a form of Personal Protective Equipment or PPE. They are used in kitchen settings to protect the kitchen staff from heat related injuries. However, one issue with having pot holders in commercial kitchens is that they are not sanitary. According to Food Service Technology 2.2, research has shown that Pot-holders are one of the sole culprits of cross contamination in the kitchen. This occurs when someone in the kitchen is working with raw food and then uses a Pot-holder without proper sanitation. When the next person uses the Pot-holder, they are subject to all the germs left behind previously. Another issue with Pot-holders is that the materials that they are made out of are often not water resistant, making them impossible to wash. This poses a problem because kitchens are full of accidental spills, and if a pot-holder becomes soiled, there is no quick solution to cleaning it. If a pot holder becomes wet in any way, it becomes a steam burn risk. Because of these risks, Pot-holders have been banned from commercial kitchens in New Zealand, but there is no sign of them doing so in the United States anytime soon.  Wool  Pot holders need to withstand temperatures over 400 degrees Fahrenheit to protect skin from hot dishes and make a potentially harmful task harmless. A common fabric used for pot-holders is wool because it can withstand very hot temperatures. What makes wool a unique product is that it is essentially flame resistant. The combination of sulfur and nitrogen provides a blend of materials that provide a flame-resistant product. The reason wool is used for many types of heat protection is that it has a high ignition temperature. This is defined as the temperature in which an item will produce a flame. Wool can be heated to over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit before the igniting of this fabric. Even when the fabric comes in contact with flames it does not disseminate the flame. This provides an even greater protective quality with the wool's low ignition temperature and the inability for flames to spread throughout the fiber. When wool is heated to a certain degree, it begins to \\"char\\" on the outside. This can provide a protective outer layer on the outside fabric. When the char on the outside of the fabric is consistent with the original properties of the wool, it can produce a safer version of the product. When the heat is directly applied to the fabric, the \\"char\\" forms a semi-liquid state which can be wiped off the fabric providing no evidence of the heat contact.  Home production  In the early days of \\"Do it yourself\\" and domestic craftwork, projects like quilting, sewing, knitting, and crocheting were used for both labor and leisure. These activities are commonly used methods to make pot-holders. Craftwork of this nature has often been associated with women and children as a tradition to be passed down from mother to daughter since before the eighteenth century. By the mid-eighteenth century, it was seen as the woman's duty to decorate and fill their home with these different types of homemaking crafts. Pot-holders appeared as one of these crafts in the late nineteenth century, usually marketed to accompany kettles and teapots. Patterns to create pot-holders at home were first seen in the United States in pamphlets and magazines, including periodicals like Workbasket, whose primary target audience consisted of the middle and working classes. This appearance of needlework patterns in magazines began around 1880 and continued to be prominent through the 1930s. During the Depression Era, designs for potholders were being published by the household press as well as makers of yarns and threads. This period of time is when pot-holders blossomed into the useful, diverse art form that is recognized by needleworkers today. Common types of pot-holder making at home include quilting, knitting, and crocheting. These techniques use different mediums such as yarn or scraps of fabric in order to create pot-holders of all different colors and patterns. Many \\"DIY\\" tutorials teach how to make a simple square pot-holder, but there are also many that teach a variety of shapes, sizes, and designs, including little houses or flowers. These homemade kitchen tools are often considered good for home decor or gift giving.  In advertising  By the early 20th century, pot-holders were regularly featured in United States' advertisements. They were featured in magazine and newspaper ads for kitchen appliances, usually providing protection between a woman's hands and her pot or pan of freshly cooked food. The appliance being advertised would often be featured as a backdrop. A typical advertisement would show a young, smiling woman using pot-holders to remove her freshly cooked bread from the oven.Philgas Stove Dealers. \\"Cook In Cool Comfort Philgas Service Gas For Homes Beyond Gas Mains.\\" Advertisement. Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA) Archives, 1885-1990s, 1932.

The company is headquartered in Buenos Aires. Staples Argentina is the largest office supply company in Argentina and one of the top three in Brazil. The company gained international recognition after Harvard Business School Professor Walter Kuemmerle wrote two cases for the International Entrepreneurship course. History Officenet was founded in 1997 by Andy Freire and Santiago Bilinkis. Seed capital was provided by four angel investors from Argentina. The next year, Officenet was selected as an Endeavor Entrepreneur. For a short period in 1999 and 2000, Officenet was a part of Submarino, Inc. Submarino started acquisition of Officenet in 1999, and the merger was finished on February 29, 2000. With the help of Submarino, Officenet expanded into Brazil that year, setting its office and warehouse in Sao Paulo. By the end of 2000, however, new investors in Officenet force a de- merge between the two companies. Officenet was purchased by Staples Inc. in 2004. This acquisition applied to both Officenet Argentina and Officenet Brazil. The first Staples store opened in Argentina on 13 May 2008, followed by a second on November 14, although operated under the Officenet corporatation. The company retained the original Officenet name until 2011, when it was rebranded as Staples Argentina. Officenet Argentina started one of the first corporate blogs in the country, in 2006. Advantages to a corporate blog include enhancing and continuing \\"a trusted relationship with consumers,\\" improving employee satisfaction, and enabling market research. Experts say that corporate blogs like Officenet's are underused in Argentina, thereby wasting these opportunities. In 2009, usability consultant Jakob Nielsen used Officenet as a case study in his Social Networking on Intranets column. Staples Argentina has been often cited for its corporate code. Harvard Business School Professor Walter Kuemmerle used the company in two cases – in 2000 and 2001 – for the International Entrepreneurship course. In 2007, Officenet was ranked #30 in the \\"Great Places to Work\\" list for Argentina, and appeared on the list again in 2009 at place #33. In 2008, the US Embassy in Argentina acknowledged Officenet Staples' corporate social responsibility efforts. In 2009, the US Department of State selected Officenet Staples Argentina as a finalist for the Award for Corporate Excellence (ACE). Founder Santiago Bilinkis left the company in 2010 after 13 years. In 2011, the company launched the \\"Programa Emprendedor,\\" a program that supports start-up (entrepreneurial) companies for up to 2 years with strong (50%) discounts. The program is part of the larger \\"Staples Soul.\\" Staples Argentina continues to roll out innovative use of technology.

The tower is located near the Tel Aviv's tallest skyscraper cluster, the Azrieli Center complex, and is occupied largely by government offices. The consolidation of many of these offices in the tower, which were previously spread out all over the Tel Aviv district, allowed the release of a considerable amount of high-value government land to private development, as well as introducing efficiencies from housing many government functions under one roof. The tower has a helipad on its roof. It was originally planned to have 28 floors for government functions only, with the additional 14 floors being approved during construction. 13 of these top floors were approved for use by private sector offices, and the top 11 floors have floor-to ceiling windows. An external elevator serves the uppermost floors, and an underpass connects the building with the tower's underground parking. The rent being paid by the government is $16/square metre per month for the next 20 years.

In 1872, he patented a bottle filled under gas pressure which pushed a marble against a rubber washer in the neck, creating a perfect seal. This became known as the Codd bottle. Early life Codd was born in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England, the son of Edwin Codd, a carpenter, who died in 1846 when Codd was 8 years old. He had two older brothers and an older sister. On 5 February 1856, at the age of 18, he married Jane Colebrooke at Holy Trinity Church, Kensington & Chelsea, London. Early in his working life he became a mechanical engineer and at the age of 23, whilst working for the British and Foreign Cork Company, greatly improving the production of corks, he was offered the position of 'traveller for the business'. He recognised a need for better bottle filling machines and a new type of closure to reduce the need for corks. Invention of the Codd bottle In 1862 he brought out a patent for measuring the flow of liquids and in 1870 devised a patented bottling machine. To understand the mineral water trade better and to prove the worth of his invention he experimented at a small mineral water works in the Caledonian Road, Islington, in London. Letters patent issued to him in November 1870 stated that he was a soda water manufacturer living at 6 Park Place, Islington. Frederick Foster and William Brooke became early backers. In 1872 he was introduced to Richard Barrett, of London, whose two sons owned the Malvern Mineral Water Co. at Grove Lane, Camberwell. Barrett became Codd's partner. This enabled Codd to continue his research into the globe-stopper idea and in particular the tool used to form the groove in the lip of the bottle and in 1873 he perfected his globe-stoppered bottle. A Codd bottle. Mineral water soda manufacturers who wanted to use Codd's Globe Stopper bottles had to pay a yearly fee for a licence to use his patent bottle. By mid-1873 he had granted 20 licences and received a further 50 applications. This was boosted further by a Trade Show held in London in the same year. By 1874 the licence was free to bottle manufacturers as long as they purchased the marbles, sealing rings and used his groove tool, and the mineral water firms they traded with had already bought a licence to use his bottle. Codd had two factories in London solely producing marbles, one in Kennington and the other in Camberwell, which was run by F. Barrett, the son of his financial backer. Hope Glass Works In September 1873 he met Ben Rylands, and by 1877 they formed a partnership and started the Hope Glass Works in Barnsley. They remained partners until Rylands's death in 1881. During this period he still had a separate partnership with Richard Barrett, who let Codd look after the day-to-day running of their interests. Late in 1881, owing to failing health, Barrett retired and passed the management of the Codd's Patents solely to Hiram Codd. His Malvern Mineral Water Works and both marble producing factories continued to thrive and he was still involved with Frederick Foster and William Brooke, his early backers. A soft drink bottle designed by Codd The Codd monument, Brompton Cemetery, London In 1880 Codd instigated the idea of a bottle exchange in London. This was slow to start but eventually caught on in London and all over the country. Many thousands of empty bottles could be returned to their original owners via bottle exchanges. Agents charged a small fee on each bottle for providing this service (one penny per each 144 bottles). Dan Rylands took over the partnership after his father's death, and in 1882 they patented 'the crystal' (valve codd). On 6 October 1884, Codd allowed his partner to buy him out of the business and started trading at 41 Gracechurch Street, London. In February of the same year, his wife died aged 54; they had four surviving children: Ada Louisa, Maud M, Edith J, and Alfred Charles. Codd married his second wife, Elizabeth Brundell (whose brother worked for the firm) in June 1885. As he did not renew any of his earlier patents, his products could now be manufactured without fear of prosecution. Early examples of these bottles sometimes have \\"CODD'S EXPIRED PATENT\\" embossed on them. Death and legacy Brompton Cemetery, monument (detail) He died at his family home, Suffolk Lodge, 162 Brixton Road, Brixton, London, on 18 February 1887 from \\"congestion of the brain and chronic disease of the liver and kidneys\\" and is buried in London's Brompton Cemetery. The family monument lies between the central and western path, midway between the north entrance and the central buildings. Codd's patented globe stopper bottle is still manufactured in India by the Khandelwal glass works. His earlier bottles are prized by antique bottle collectors worldwide.

Greece and Prussia established diplomatic relations in 1834, the same year both countries exchanged embassies. Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the relation with Germany The two countries were enemies during both World Wars, with Germany taking part in the Axis Occupation of Greece during World War II. The issue of reparations for German war crimes and the forced loan during the Occupation continues to be unsettled. There is a 300,000 people Greek community living in Germany, most of them came during the 1960s and 1970s.

In 1999 the Greek foreign minister Theodoros Pangalos caused a diplomatic crisis when he stated that \\"Germany is a political dwarf\\"Θ.Πάγκαλος tovima.gr and later apologized. However, relations were strained during the European sovereign-debt crisis between the nations.German Patience With Greece on the Euro Wears Thin 8 May 2012. Although many media outlets tried to damage relations through polemical reporting, there was an initiative on the part of the state to counteract this. The most known is the founding of the german-Greek Youth organisation (Deutsch-griechisches Jugendwerk). In general, German-Greek relations are considered to be balanced, and at European level the countries work well together. One exception is the German position in relation to Turkish-Greek relations. Germany has increased its investments in Turkey in recent decades and, unlike France or Israel, does not take a clear view of Turkish aggression against Greece. A few months before Turkish warships entered Greek maritime territory in 2020, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas increased arms exports in the maritime sector.

He drew two separate strips for the mid-eighties anthology comic Reverie, alongside creators Paul Harris, Peter Hughes, Robert Shaw, Fil Barlow, Michael Dutkiewicz and Ian C. Thomas. Hall was born in Bairnsdale, Victoria. He was with Reverie for its entire seven-issue run, and created Sandy Star: Rebel Force (Reverie 1–3), a sci-fi strip, and Bloodgard (Reverie 4–7), a dark superhero concept.  The Reverie Years  Reverie was the brainchild of Gary Dellar, who envisaged an anthology title similar to British weekly comics, although with a semi-regular schedule. Gary Dellar also had the help of Paul Harris, whose experience in advertising contributed to production values. The comic was available through newsagents between 1983 and 1986. The average early print run was 2500 and later with a slow but steady growth in sales, hit the incredible amount [issue seven] of 9,000. The cost in financing a comic privately and have it distributed through Gordon & Gotch was enormous. Gary Dellar in his attempt to save on costs purchased a printing press and started printing the comic himself. The covers having been out sourced. Widely distributed through newsagents with an agreement that the comic would have a shelve life of two months, it made the return sales some what of a terminal effect on the future of the comic. The biggest issue, being the last issue, had taken a mere 5 months to tell if it had been a success. It was. Selling two thirds of the print run and making a profit. Unfortunately by the time this information came to the surface, the printing press was sold and the comic was no more. There were at least 15 new artists on board and ready to publish. The major inroads with the future design and direction with issue eight onwards was to be enormous. With seven issues, it filled an important role at the time, giving new creators a chance to develop their skills and established artists a new platform for their talents. During the course of its run, other artists came on board, some of whom went on to work in the mainstream American comics. Most notable is Michal Dutkiewicz, who went on to work for DC Comics, and Fil Barlow, creator of Zooniverse. Hall joined Reverie in the months before its first issue, proposing a strip he'd first devised during his last year of high school. His first episode was co-plotted by his then-wife, Zora Marko. His second Sandy Star episode also featured background art by Dellar. In the latter part of the Reverie run, he concentrated more on writing, allowing a talented teen-aged artist, Mark Ryan, an opportunity.  From Sandy Star to Bloodgard  George was self-taught, but worked to master the learning curve of published work. He experimented with various techniques during his first three episodes, such as having a background artist in Sandy Star's second episode, while tackling duotones in the third. He even welcomed a different artistic interpretation of Bloodgard after its initial episode. On the writing side of things, his Bloodgard episodes utilized different characters' perspectives for each chapter (Bloodgard third and fourth episodes). Generally, Bloodgard is the better written of his two strips. The Australian fan press reaction to his work was more favorable to Bloodgard than to Sandy Star: Rebel Force. In Reverie 3, he introduced an early version of Bloodgard as a secondary character, to assist the plot, then switched entirely over to Bloodgard in Reverie 4, with Sandy Star's last appearance being to introduce Bloodgard's origin and ensure a smooth transition to the new strip. Bloodgard was a chilling concept. The first two episodes started off as typical superhero fare, only to twist by the end of the second episode, where Bloodgard destroyed the two major global superpowers of his timeline and took over his world. Episodes three and four dealt with the first story arc, where he drew four non-powered versions of himself from other timelines in a bid to destroy them. Had Reverie continued publishing past issue 7, the arc would have ended with one of the four alternate timeline duplicates donning a different set of Bloodgard armour to become the new Bloodgard and take the series further. The strip anticipated trends in comics that would crop up in the mainstream American ones a few years afterward. Image:Bloodgardep1p1.JPG Image:Bloodgardep1p2.JPG The second episode of Bloodgard featured the art of fourteen-year-old Mark Ryan, who stayed on the strip through to Reverie 7. George continued as writer.  Recent Endeavours  Hall wrote a novel called A Question of Theories and explored publishing it via print-on-demand publishing. He has also written a screenplay of the same name. The novel is a non-superhero work, a satire on American movies of the nineties. In 2012, it became available as an ebook both on Apple iBooks and Barnes-and-Noble. He continued working on the Bloodgard concept over the years, renaming it to Terrorgard and has recently started writing a prose version, updating it from its original 1980s millieu. In February, 2009, George Hall was a Twitter volunteer during the Victorian Black Saturday bushfires, relaying important emergency tweets as @geehall1. He again fulfilled this role during other emergencies, including 2010-2011 Queensland Floods and Victorian floods, receiving recognition for this in a number of Australian studies into the use of social media in emergencies.

From autumn of 1920, Soviet Russia, having concluded the friendship treaty with the Government of the Grand National Assembly in March 1921, went on to extend material assistance, both in gold and arms, to the Kemalist regime in Ankara, thus significantly contributing to the Kemalists′ military success in the war against the Greeks in Asia Minor,«Международная жизнь», 1963, № 11, p. 148. where the genocide of native Greeks was completed as a result in 1922. The USSR and the Kingdom of Greece established diplomatic relations on 8 March 1924.

The Percentages agreement struck by Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill in Moscow in October 1944, which placed Greece firmly in the UK′s spheres of influence, led to the Soviet Union′s non-interference in support of the communist uprising in Athens in December 1944 that was crushed with the UK′s backing as well as to Stalin′s reluctance to render tangible assistance to the Greek Communists during the Civil War that they lost in October 1949.David Carlton.

Military cooperation President Vladimir Putin with former PM Costas Simitis in 2003 Greece is one of the few pre-1990 NATO member countries (alongside Germany for a time) that makes extensive use of Russian weapons. Greece first received many Soviet-era surplus weapons, such as BMP-1 armoured fighting vehicles, RM-70 rocket launchers, ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft guns and SA-8 anti-aircraft missile systems from the former East German National People's Army inventory in the early 1990s. Since then, Greece has additionally procured the TOR M-1 and S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems (the latter originally destined for Cyprus), the Kornet-E anti-tank missile, AK-74M assault rifles and ZUBR hovercrafts. The militaries of both countries also participate in programmes of military cooperation in the Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, as well as giving military support and training to countries that they have close relations with, such as Armenia, with Greece often accepting Armenian military officials in the Hellenic Military Academy. Economic relations = Burgas-Alexandroupoli pipeline = The Burgas- Alexandroupoli pipeline was proposed in 1993–1994 by several Russian and Greek companies. In 1994, for construction of the pipeline Greece and Bulgaria signed a bilateral agreement, followed by a memorandum of cooperation, signed by Greece and Russia. In February 1998, a Greek consortium for pipeline construction named Bapline was established, and in May 1998, a memorandum of creation of the Transbalkan Oil Pipeline Company was signed. In 2000, a technical specifications and an economic evaluation of the project were prepared by the German company ILF. A joint protocol for preparing the pipeline's construction was signed by the three countries in January 2005. The political memorandum between both governments was signed on 12 April 2005. An inter-governmental agreement on the project was agreed on 7 February 2007, and it was signed on 15 March 2007 in Athens, by the involved ministers of the three countries, under the presence of their leaders, Vladimir Putin (Russian president), Sergei Stanishev (Bulgarian prime-minister), and Kostas Karamanlis (prime-minister of Greece). The agreement establishing the international project company was signed in Moscow on 18 December 2007 and the company, called Trans-Balkan Pipeline B.V., was incorporated in the Netherlands on 6 February 2008. Construction of the pipeline was scheduled to start in October 2009, and was estimated to be completed by 2011. In 2011, the project was definitively terminated. = Trade = Since 2014, mutual trade between the countries has been in steady decline.По святым местам: Что ввело Путина во гнев перед паломничеством на Афон Lenga.ru, 28 May 2016. Religious and cultural ties, mutual perceptions Religious ties between the two nations with majorities of both countries adhering to the Eastern Orthodox Church, have played a major role in fostering bilateral relations.
