It was originally broadcast in the United States on Starz on 29 July 2011, in Australia on UKTV on 30 July 2011, in Canada on Space on 30 July 2011, and in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 4 August 2011. Torchwood: Miracle Day follows the aftermath of a day where humanity has stopped being able to die. In the episode, a team called Torchwood raid the Los Angeles headquarters of a pharmaceutical company that appeared to have foreknowledge of \\"Miracle Day\\" to steal information kept on the servers. Plot Esther visits her sister, Sarah Drummond. She sees the house boarded up and tells Sarah why she's going to stop the miracle. She asks to see Alice and Melony Drummond before she goes. Sarah refuses because of her mental condition, thinking the miracle a poison, and shuts the door. In her car, Esther phones Social Services and reports the two girls are in danger, but refuses to give her name. She drives off. A man in a black car with the strange GPS triangle icon reports ESTHER DRUMMOND LOCATED. A voice orders him to follow Esther to lead him to Torchwood. The team arrive in California and rent a shack to plan the assault. A woman gives Rex a Dead is Dead campaign flyer. Rex phones Dr. Vera Juarez. She tells him it's a campaign run by Ellis Hartley Monroe. Gwen gets a call from Rhys and asks about her father and daughter. Rhys says they are fine and jokes about why she is in Los Angeles. As Gwen talks, the man stalking them takes photos of her. During a conversation with Rex, Esther reveals that he has family in California, but Rex denies all knowledge. Later on, he sneaks out to visit his father, who resents his presence and threatens him with a shotgun, claiming that Rex hadn't cared about him for fifteen years. The team begin plans for a raid on PhiCorp in order to steal server hard drives, where Esther reveals they have a bio-metric security system. In order to bypass it they need a voice recording, a palm print and a retina scan from a man called Nickolas Frumpkin. To obtain this, Jack and Gwen pretend they are an American couple and approach Nicholas Frumpkin, his wife and his baby. Jack uses the alias John Smith when he introduces himself to them. Using a great deal of skill, (recording him saying his name, taking fingerprints from a flask Gwen makes him hold and getting a picture of his eyes) they are able to begin the raid on PhiCorp. Meanwhile, the hit man finds Nickolas Frumpkin, recording his voice, then cutting off the palm of his hands and removing one of his eyes. Gwen is able to get into the building with help from Esther hacking the phone system. Jack supposedly delivers a package to PhiCorp, but inside is an exact copy of the PhiCorp server, only designed to look like it suffered fire damage. Activating the fire alarm, Jack and Gwen are able to remove the hard drives. However, when Jack leaves to get them out of the building, Gwen is ambushed by the hit man. When Jack finds one of the delivery staff hung yet still alive, he rushes back to help Gwen and finds her bound hand and foot and gagged with plastic wires, but he too is knocked out and tied up with plastic wires. Rex rushes in to save them, climbing 66 flights of stairs and suffering heavy bleeding. The hit man reveals he knows Jack is mortal, and wants to guarantee a place in a \\"New World Order\\" by bringing him to \\"Them\\". He plans to slit the throat of the now un-gagged Gwen, who almost tricks him into revealing who he works for, but Rex bursts in and shoots the man several times, destroying his throat. Later on, they search the hard drives and learn about \\"Overflow Camps\\". However, Rhys calls Gwen to tell her that her father is being sent to one of these camps as well and by the time Gwen tells him to stop them, her father has already been taken away. Dr. Vera Juarez and several doctors visit an abandoned hospital that is being used to handle the extra surplus of patients but much to Vera's frustration, the plan is a failure as there are too many patients admitted to the hospital and they don't have enough equipment to handle them. Meanwhile, Ellis Hartley Monroe, a mayor and member of the Tea Party, starts a campaign called \\"Dead is Dead\\", which aims to segregate the undying from the public until death finally comes for them. Oswald, Jilly and PhiCorp do not like this since her popularity might derail Oswald's and threaten PhiCorp's plans. When Ellis makes a speech near the hospital where the extra patients are being sent, Oswald makes a bold move by entering the hospital and meeting the patients there, thus making the press immediately focus on him. Inside, Oswald tells the patients that they all deserve equal medical treatment and that people like Ellis are trying to take their rights away from them as they don't consider them human anymore. He promises to fight on their behalf and instantly the patients, the press and the public call Oswald a hero, much to Ellis's frustration. The secret organization that controls PhiCorp drugs Ellis and when she comes to she is tied up and gagged in her car. She is in a car compactor, where they tell her \\"The Families\\" will eliminate anyone who poses a threat to them before her car is crushed in the compactor, trapping Ellis inside. Reception Den of Geek gave the episode a positive review saying \\"Come the end of Escape To L.A., it feels as if most of Miracle Day‚Äôs key themes are now firmly established, even if the detail is yet to come. And the episode is an interesting one. It doesn‚Äôt have the lovely smaller moments that really set Dead Of Night apart, and we still think that episode three is the peak of the series to date. But, episode four? It's still strong, and it's still worth tuning in to see.\\" References External links Category:2011 British television episodes Category:Torchwood episodes ","title":"Escape to L.A."},{"id":"32571304","text":"Rafael Roncagliolo at the World Economic Forum on Latin America in 2012 Fortunato Rafael Roncagliolo de Orbegoso (born 14 November 1944 in Lima) is a Peruvian sociologist and politician.

Established in 1880, it is one of the oldest schools in Nagpur.:: Bloom where you are planted :: Missionaries of St. Francis de Sales History St. John's High School was established by the missionaries of St. Francis de Sales towards the end of the 19th century in Nagpur city. It is difficult to trace the exact date on which this institution came into existence. St. John's School, at the early stage, was managed by St. Francis de Sales School, which was established in 1867 to cater to the educational needs of the children of the Europeans and Anglo-Indians in and around Nagpur city. St. John's came into existence as the Indian or native department of S.F.S. School for the Indian Christian. The medium of instruction was Hindi. The Indian/native department of S.F.S School admitted many Hindu and Muslim students besides many Indian Christians. As the number of students steadily increased, it grew into a separate institution. It was named as St. Francis Xavier's school. At that stage it was under the management of S.F.S. School and accommodated in the Nagpur Cathedral compound. In 2016 Fr. Patric Wall MSFS, who was in charge of the Indian Christians, was also given the responsibility of managing the St. Francis Xavier's School. During his time the school was renamed as R.C. Mission school and it was shifted to a newly constructed building in the Cathedral compound. Fr. Wall succeeded in getting the school affiliated to the Calcutta University. In 1912 Fr. John D‚ÄôCosta MSFS was appointed as principal of R.C. Mission School. During his time, the school steadily increased in enrollment. It also made remarkable progress in academics, as well as sports and games. Since it was difficult for the R.C. Mission school to continue in the cathedral compound for want of space, Fr. D‚ÄôCosta decided to shift the school to a more spacious place at Mohan Nagar. The school was renamed as St. John's High School and was shifted in 1929 to the new building at Mohan Nagar. At first the middle school classes, and later the primary and high school sections, were shifted to the new campus. The first batch of 39 students appeared for SSC in 1916. \\"In 1951 according to an agreement signed between Very Rev. Fr. A. Grorod msfs, Superior General of the MSFS, and Bishop Gayet msfs of Nagpur, St. John‚Äôs high School was handed over to the MSFS, who made it their mother house\\".cf. Fr. Francis Moget msfs, Shepherds for Christ, p. 111 The school at present has a strength of 2950 boys and 93 members on the staff. Instruction is given in Hindi and English from pre-primary to Class Ten. Fr. A.G. Lobo along with Br. Herold began the work of the first floor of the school building in February 1952, adding seven more classrooms, The front tower was built in 1953, surmounted by a cement cross in February 1954 and adorned in May 1954 with a tower-clock, which was brought from France. There were a few eminent teachers on the staff of St. John's, including S.B. Shastry, who won the Best Teacher State Award in 1969 and H.G. Chourse, winner of the best Teacher National Award in 1981-82. The school was declared as a Heritage Building for the city of Nagpur on 16 February 2000, because of its peculiar architectural design. Holy Cross Sisters in St. John‚Äôs From the \\"Family Annals\\" of the Holy Cross Sister of Chavanod it is traceable that the sisters began their association with St. John's School in 1953. This began with a formal request made by the then Superior of St. John's to the Provincial Superior of the Sisters, who gladly sent a team of three sisters. They were Sr. Vitalis D‚ÄôSouza, Sr. Angela Lobo and Sr. Mercia Alvares, who took up teaching in the pre-primary and primary sections of St. John's school. Since then the sisters continue to render their valuable services in St. John's until today. Since there was no convent of their own, the sisters had a lot of difficulties in finding a proper accommodation. Initially, from 1953 to 1957, they stayed at Victoria Building which was on rent. From 1957, the sisters stayed at a hostel on Mount Road extension which they opened for working women. In 1971 they began staying at St. John's. Since June 1990 the sisters have continue their association with St. John's while residing at S.F.S. New venture The existing primary building is situated at the south of the main school building. As it was old and dilapidated, the management had thought of constructing a new building for the pre-primary and primary sections of St. John's school for quite some time. A serious thought of constructing a new building for the primary section of the school was given during the time of Fr. K.V. Joseph, who was its principal (1994‚Äì96). On 28 March 1995, thought to be the auspicious occasion to venture into such an ambitious plan, on 28 March 1995 in the presence of a large number of people (mostly staff and students) Fr. Agnelo Fernandes, provincial of Nagpur province, blessed the foundation stone and it was laid by the chief guest, Rajesh Tambay, Mayor of Nagpur and the guest of honour Sunil Argarwal, the Deputy Mayor. Others who were present at the function were Fr. Joseph Plattotham, the Manager of St. John's and Sr. Lucy Mathew, the headmistress of the primary section. Though the construction began in all earnestness it could not go further than laying the foundation and raising the columns for the ground floor. It remained in that stage for a few years until the construction work began again during 2000 during the time of Fr. K.V. Joseph as principal. Now the main building of the primary school is almost ready with 23 classrooms and the offices. Part of the plan of a multipurpose hall for the primary section remains unattended. A lot of work remains to be done before it is found fit to shift to the new premises which is situated on the north of the existing high school building. St. Johns School has been in existence since 1880. During its 123 years of existence, the institution has built up a unique tradition of imparting all around education to the ordinary and under privileged children in and around Nagpur. Numerous former students of this institution are well established in life in India and abroad. The school has instituted the Sanjana - Shastri award for academic excellence in high school in honor of two of the famous teachers, and the Premnath Award for excellent performance in dramatics, which is named after the film actor Premnath, a former student of the school.

Currently, it represents 41 congregations totalling about 60.000 members. The offices are located in Oslo. It is a member of the European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR). Organization The Islamic Council Norway was founded on 22 October 1993. Since 2006, it has received state funding from the Norwegian Ministry of Culture . The funding was about 1,3 million NOK a year. The organisation's membership counts Muslim congregations centered around several different immigrant groups, notably Albanian, Bosnian, Iraqi and Pakistani congregations, as well as mosques with congregations that do not center around specific ethnic groups. Its stated mission is to *engage in work that allows Norwegian Muslims to live according to Islamic teachings within the general Norwegian society and to establish a Norwegian Muslim identity *promote solidarity among Norwegian Muslims and further the interests and rights of the member organizations *act as a mediary and dialogue partner to create mutual understanding and respect between Norwegian Muslims and non-Muslims, with respect to religion, culture and moral values. In 2017the IRN lost its state funding from the Norwegian Ministry of Culture. The ministry stated it was dissatisfied with how IRN had handled its role as a dialogue partner with the Norwegian majority society and its role as an umbrella organisation. Other muslim community leaders supported the decision and supported the view that IRN had not encouraged dialogue with Norwegian society. Community leaders had on previous occasions stated that IRN did not represent them. Activities The organisation has since its foundation been in active dialogue with the Church of Norway Council on Ecumenical and International Relations. The council's work is organised in issue-specific committees, such as a hilal committee that works to advise Norwegian Muslims on how the Islamic calendar should be interpreted in Norway, a Halal committee that oversees ritual slaughtering, in accordance with animal welfare laws, at designated Norwegian meat processing plants mainly owned by Nortura, and a burial committee, which collaborates with Norwegian Church Authorities to establish and maintain Muslim cemeteries. Controversies Homosexuality In 2008 the council met protest for an alleged refusal to take a stance against death penalty for homosexuality, instead deferring the matter to the European Fatwa Council (ECFR). The Council's leader, Senaid Kobilica, stressed his personal opposition to the death penalty, but acknowledged that some may interpret Islamic texts differently. Homosexual and lesbian activist groups protested against the council's refusal to deplore the death penalty. Yusuf al- Qaradawi The Islamic Council Norway was criticised in 2009 when, according to some sources, it refused to distance itself or comment on the leader of the European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR), Yusuf al-Qaradawi, after he praised the Holocaust as \\"a divine punishment for the Jews.\\" However, the council's leader did in fact issue a statement where al-Qaradawis praise of Holocaust was deemed \\"unacceptable\\", and promised that the council would pursue the matter through its membership in the ECFR.  Niqab  In March 2017 the IRN hired Leyla Hasic, a woman who wears the face-covering veil niqab to work with communication and as a \\"bridge builder to mainstream society\\" for the organisation. She was a strong proponent of the garment. Minister of Culture Linda Hofstad Helleland criticised the appointment of Hasic as creating a greater distance between Muslim and Norwegian society and lessening the mutual understanding. Prime minister Erna Solberg publicly stated that a person wearing niqab would never be employed by her.

Badigeru is a valley swamp with papyrus along the river and typical grasses for the region in the floodplain. Although not protected, it is relatively undisturbed by human activity. The swamps are fed by the Kinyeti River and others that drain the northern slopes of the Imatong Mountains. These swamps, running in a SSW-NNE direction for , are discontinuous. They may be as wide as in the rainy season, but average in width. The swamps in turn may drain westward into the Bahr el Jebel section of the White Nile or eastward into the Veveno River. Lt. Colonel P. Molloy visited the swamp in the dry season between 23 and 25 February 1950, possibly the first European to reach the area. Starting from Mongalla, he traveled eastward across dry, open grassland for between and to a pool on the Khor Son, the name given to the Kinyeti River near the swamp. According to the local people, the Badigeru was the only reliable source of water between Mongalla and Lafon. Molloy's observations of wildlife tended to confirm that the water, which he found drinkable, remained year round. When Molloy visited, the Khor Son was between 150 and 200 yards wide, winding across a flat plain between a series of shallow depressions. In the winter, the wide plain would be flooded to form the swamp. Molloy described rich wildlife in and around the swamp. He observed large numbers of pelicans, open-billed storks, wood ibis, sacred ibis, marabout, saddleback and hammerheaded storks, fishing eagles, lily-trotters, grey herons, spurwing geese, comb duck, whistling teal and common teal. In the burnt grassland around the swamp he saw zebra, hartebeeste, tiang, reedbuck and Mongalla Gazelle. He also saw giraffe, ostrich, elephant and lion.

Wolf have collaborated since 1986. Lamarre (born in Monroe, Michigan, 1950), was the oldest of seven children in a large Roman Catholic family. His early inspiration to be an American contemporary artist came as a child seeing the Diego Rivera, Detroit Industry Murals at the Detroit Institute of Art. Lamarre received his BFA for painting, ceramics and photography from the University of Michigan, graduating in 1979. He was mentored there by the abstract expressionist painter Gerome Kamrowski who actually encouraged Lamarre to \\"drop out\\" and move to New York. However, Lamarre completed his degree graduating magna cum laude and, after a brief spell in Chicago, Illinois, moved to New York City in 1980 where he still lives and works with his wife and art collaborator Melissa P. Wolf. The duo, called EIDIA, began working together while Lamarre was living at the Chelsea Hotel, (to create The Chelsea Tapes video series). This work was made possible by a fellowship from the New York Creative Artist's Program Service. Melissa P. Wolf (born in Buffalo, New York) attended Syracuse University, Boston Museum School, Tufts University and Pratt Institute Brooklyn, New York. The name EIDIA (created by Lamarre) is derived from the ancient Greek word for idea, ‚Äúeidos‚Äù, but the acronym has many possible meanings that Lamarre and Wolf outlined in their 1978 manifesto:Manifesto Each Idea Defines Itself Aesthetically; Esthetic Interpretations Directs Imaginative Action; Everything I Do Is Art; Every Individual Does Individual Art; Every Individual Develops Ideal Aesthetics; Every Intellect Develops Intuitive Art; and Ecological Involvement Demands Immediate Action/Individual Action. EIDIA approaches their work in many ways, playing with different concepts and materials simultaneously. Over the years, they have worked in sculpture, photography, painting and video and film, presenting everything from static objects to multimedia installations. For years, they have purposefully worked outside of traditional gallery systems. EIDIA House, founded by Lamarre and Wolf, is a meeting place and forum for artists, scholars, poets, writers, architects and others who are interested in the arts as instrument for positive social change (a concept dubbed \\"id√©e force\\" by the late French sociologist, anthropologist and philosopher Pierre Bourdieu). The intent of EIDIA House is to ‚Äúbroaden aesthetic research, promote a comprehensive expansion of the influence of art on a world wide basis, encourage 'green' architecture, and create an authentic forum for social change originating from the art world‚Äù. Although EIDIA House can be located anywhere, at the moment it is based in Lamarre and Wolf‚Äôs home and studio space, located in the Williamsburg area of New York City‚Äôs Brooklyn borough.  Major works  Lamarre and Wolf began their collaboration in 1983 with the video series The Chelsea Tapes,, EIDIA interview, The Chelsea Tapes, by Mehmet Alatur, Cinepolis - Architecture in Film, Hamburg Germany, September 2009 a series of 26 video vignettes forming an autobiographical diary of Lamarre's extended stay at the famous Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan. Inspired by the fact that Dylan Thomas, Virgil Thomson, Viva and Sid Vicious all lived at the Hotel, he sought to capture in video what influences, if any, the Hotel could have on his work. Lamarre began shooting in 1983 and soon found a collaborator in Melissa P. Wolf after they met at a New Museum opening. (At that time, the museum was still up-and-coming under the driving force of its sole founder Marcia Tucker.) Wolf became chief cameraman and editor of The Chelsea Tapes. Their next video and book project, FOOD SEX ART the Starving Artists' Cookbook (1986‚Äì1991),, Bourgeois the Artist, Bourgeois the Cook chronicled approximately 150 artists cooking in the US, Europe and Russia. While expounding on the artists' relationship between art and life, FOOD SEX ART the Starving Artists' Cookbook is also a portrait series on the artist in society and a video documentation of the social-economic condition of the arts community in downtown New York and internationally. THE DECONSUMPTIONISTS 2005-present, EIDIA, exhibition, Sydney College of the Arts 2011 Continuing their work in video, EIDIA went on to make the award-winning documentary the nea tapes (1995‚Äì2001),, From airmen to animators, A few of the week‚Äôs 100-plus on-screen excursions about the threatened dismantling of The National Endowment for the Arts. The piece is held in the library collections of over 200 universities, colleges and art institutes. Based on the nea tapes archive, Lamarre and Wolf interviewed over 300 artists, curators, art professionals, politicians and religious persons on their views on the status of American art in the late 1990s. the nea tapes also had the distinction of being screened in the US Capitol Building, Washington DC, under the auspices of the office of the Representative Jerrold Nadler. EIDIA‚Äôs performance/installation DECONSUMPTION (2001 to 2007) was modeled on the idea of \\"more production of less\\". They performed the \\"sale\\" of numerous found objects (reclaimed by EIDIA as ‚Äúart‚Äù) purchased by the thousands of visitors to EIDIA House. With this piece, their production of artistic matter shifted from creating works using new materials to re-introducing, re-considering, re-shaping and recycling pre- existing items (remarkably, before the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù era ever began).

In documents partially different names and spellings can be found (Bayer, Peyer, Bayarius, Bayoarius, Bavarus, Cristoferus Bauari, etc.).  Personalia  Christian Beyer was born in 1482 Kleinlangheim in Lower Franconia, now part of Bavaria the son of the town bailiff Hans Beyer. He enrolled in winter semester 1500/1501 at the University of Erfurt, Thuringia. In the summer of 1503 the young Franken was accredited as Cristoferus Bauari de Lanckhem (i.e. Christianus Baierus, Quinomen Magnum.) to the free University of Wittenberg in the former spa town of Wittenberg in Saxony. According to the historic collection of Wittenberg University, he became one of the first students at the newly founded free establishment with a fast gaining reputation. In 1505 he obtained the master's degree and in 1507 they called the highly talented young man as a teacher at the ‚ÄúArtistic Faculty‚Äù (~Legal Faculty). Three years later (1510), he received his doctorate from the new Faculty of Law as Doctorado [~PhD] in both law disciplines. He also got married in the same year to Magdalena Gertitz (Corticus), daughter of Wittenberg Mayor Ambrosius Gertitz (Corticus). From this marriage he had a son Christian Beyer, the Younger (d. 1561) and a daughter Barbara Beyer (she later was married to Leonard D. Stetner, the District Registrar of Ansbach province.) He bought the property ‚ÄúMarket no.6‚Äù, in centre of the old town (Alt-Stadt) Wittenberg, the now constituting the now famous \\"Beyer-Hof‚Äù. Already in 1512 his house was victim of a fire outbreak, but the professor began as early as the same year with the reconstruction of the house. Because he suffered so much in construction costs, he later asked the Elector of Saxony to increase his annual salary by 30 florins. This building was like most of the major buildings of the time also lodging for students. Payments for boarding and lodging of the students were an important source of income for the town‚Äôs citizens, as well as for the mentors and professors. It is well known even in the houses of Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon's students was staying and living.  Saxon Councillary Service  1513 became Dr. jur. Christian Beyer the legal councillor of Frederick III, Elector of Saxony and also for the first time elected as town Mayor. He served as Mayor for further periods in the years 1516, 1519, 1522 and 1525 and served in the years 1520, 1523 and 1526 as a consulting former Mayor, the Council of Wittenberg. In the years of advancing the Reformation, so he turned his endeavours for the town of Wittenberg towards fulfilling his teaching post at the university. Nevertheless Martin Luther criticized him initially because he did not immediately renounced the papal principles, and because of his stubbornness to continue the ‚ÄúJus Canonicum‚Äù . He soon altered his opinion and strode in the aftermath to a conversion to the Reformed faith. In October 1520, Christian Beyer and other members of the Electoral Councils the advice to Frederick III, Elector of Saxony on the threat of excommunication bull against Martin Luther. They argued that the issue \\"should be treated the matter as harmless and dilatory‚Äù. In 1521, the ‚ÄúWittenberg movement‚Äù began among the Augustinian monks of the monastery of Wittenberg. The first church services in accordance to the Pope's way was abolished in the Castle and Town Church in Wittenberg. [Martin] Luther held at that time a hiding place on the Wartburg Castle, and did not know what strides his religious brethren was conducting in Wittenberg. When he heard this, he wrote them a letter. In which, he congratulated them and wished that the ‚Äúproject happy operations were carried out‚Äù. This letter shows, however, that the monks were not unanimous or undiversified. George Spalatin, the Saxon Elector‚Äôs theological adviser, had restrained them to moderation, out of concern that Martin Luther could gain even more resentment of his adversaries. However, this process had reached the ears of the Prior of the Augustinians, Conrad Held. He did not agree with what had occurred, and made a strong notion towards an abolition of the strides. He denounced the Augustinian monk Gabriel Didymun, as ringleader of the movement. The Elector himself was apparently very upset by this news and sent his Chancellor Dr. Gregor Br√ºck to the Academy in order to prevent the undertaking. However, the Augustinian friars were able to convince the old Chancellor that this approach was wrong, so that he officially changed his position in this debate. However, the Elector was with not all satisfied with his statement in this issue. Therefore, he instructed Vice-Chancellor Dr. Christian Beyer with a further clarification of the matter. However, Christian Beyer could not achieve anything amongst the monks, because the monks had a conviction of their conscience. Based on this dispute probably not only Frederick III, Elector of Saxony converted to the new gospel, but also Christian Beyer. Following the successful implementation of the monks, it also made the other churches to implement these changes.  Expatrial period in Denmark  From 1519/20 he and Martin Luther were invited to Denmark by King Christian II. While Luther abstained he made the long journey and acted as an assigned as legal adviser to King and the Queen of Denmark, who through the Nordic Kalmar Union also was regent of Sweden as well as Norway. He initiated legal studies at University of Copenhagen in 1922-23 and was the main author of a new Nordic legislation, of which King Christian II quite prematurely attempted to introduce onto the Nordic Kingdom (Kalmar Union). There were significant resistance to this, particularly among the nobility of Sweden, where in 1523 was a violent skirmish which in retrospect is called \\"Stockholm Bloodbath,\\" where as many as 70 were killed. This led further to accession of Gustav Wasa as King of Goths and Swedes and the final end of the Nordic Kalmar Union. The suggested legislation was halted and not introduced in Norway and ng Christian II had to dethrone himself as King and escape to his daughter, who in fact was married to Frederick III, Elector of Saxony in Weimar. On 16 June 1524 he was given the mission for Queen Elizabeth of Denmark to bring a suit against the Holstein nobility over confiscated lands. (Ref. Munich fonts # 531) The case was settled in the German Supreme Court in Altenburg, in full favor of the Royal claim. Later in 1522 Christian Beyer was back in Saxony and again became very busy as Town Mayor.  Time of emerging struggle  Andreas Bodenstein von Karlstadt, gave instruction that schools and churches should be stormed to remove and destroy pictures and precious insignia. This is denoted in history as ‚ÄúIconoclasm‚Äù. Because Christian Beyer was council member of University of Wittenberg and also the Town Council, he had to calm down turmoil caused and restore community order. It can be hard to imagine how the shrewd lawyer obtained a solution between the Elector and Andreas von Karlstad. However, he was able to initially alleviate these efforts through mediator's settlements. The consequences of the Reformation development, not always met the consensus of the citizens of the town. Between the Council and the reformers there was negotiated a consensus of social order that was brought into force. However, the town barber surgeon Valten, publicly insulted the reformer Martin Luther and the Mayor Beyer, with his remark ‚Äúthey were worthy to be chased out of the state\\". He was later fined for profanity through his remarks. On 7 July 1526 brought Luther's wife, Katharina von Bora, her son John to the world. The infant was baptized in accordance with custom on the same day 16 o‚Äôclock in the church by the deacon George R√∂rer. Among the sponsors, who all belonged to the inner circle around the reformer, are Johannes Bugenhagen, Justus Jonas, the Elder, Lucas Cranach the Elder, the wife of the mayor Hohndorf Benedicta (d. 1546) and the Saxon Vice-Chancellor Christian Beyer. Luther called his old friend from now, in mutual recognition, his \\"godfather\\". John the Steadfast When the Saxon Elector Frederick, the Clever died in 1528 and his brother John took over stately business of government, Christian Beyer was called at the court as Chancellor of John, Elector of Saxony (John, \\"the Steadfast\\", in Weimar. He was one of the highest officials of the Electorate. Beyer now put an end to his teaching at Wittenberg University \\"Leucorea‚Äù. He joined Wittenberg Town Council replacing Gregor Br√ºck in 1529.  The Diet of Augsburg  In the capacity as Chancellor of Saxony, we now find him in the proceedings of the Elector again from 1529. Furthermore as the Chancellor of Saxony he performed the on 25 June 1530 in the afternoon from 3 until 5 o'clock Diet of Augsburg to Emperor Charles V and the other Electors of the Holy Roman Empire with the German edition of \\"Augsburg Confession\\", as skilfully developed by Philipp Melanchthon. Reading of the Confessio Augustana in front of Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Augsburg, 1530 The session was held in the chapter-hall of the Episcopal Palace. He read it aloud and was widely heard, so that the crowd, which stood close together in the outside courtyard, could understand word for word of the speech through the open window. This is the first official and until now has remained firm commitment of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. In 1532 of his chancellery phase, he served in the succession homage proceedings of John, Elector of Saxony in the city of Gotha, as when he also was at the convention in Brunswick to confirm the formal council authority of the town Buttelst√§dt. In 1533 he was invested as witness to the dispute regarding the Elector's financial credit given to Wolffen, Count of Barby, and the Castle and township of Barby and it's signed ‚ÄúPrivileges of Werdau‚Äù.In 1534 he was in the then Upper Kranichfeld (today Kranichfeld), where he exhibited the Credit documents. In 1535 the Chancellor Christian Beyer was a member of the Arbitration Court held between the Elector John Frederick of Saxony and Duke George of Saxony. The proceedings for the prominent gentlemen of Hofgarten was to be held in Leipzig. However, before it could come to the legal proceedings, he died on 21 October 1535 in Weimar, suffering severe stomach cramps. His property Beyerhof in Wittenberg was passed to his son Christian Beyer jr. in the same year. An Epitaph was built in 1917, in the village church of Kleinlangheim, honouring their great son of the Reformation. In his original residential building located in the Lutherstadt Wittenberg, there is also commemorative plaque of him. A similar sandstone grave plaque has recently been found in Weimar City Church and can now be seen adjacent to his gravesite inside the church.  Family history  On 3 October 1510 he married Magdalena, daughter of the Mayor of Wittenberg, Ambrosius Gertitz. From this marriage is 21 (in question for misinterpretation?) children to have emerged. After the death of Beyer Philipp Melanchthon was granted custody care of his younger (adopted?) children. These are known as children of Magdalena: * Christian Beyer, the younger, married in 1541 Sybille (‚Ä† September 8, 1563 in Wittenberg), the daughter of a physician Stephen Wild * In year 1545 Caspar married Sibyl Beyer * Andreas Beyer [family descending from him lived in Kleinlangheim up to 2001.] * Georg Beyer married Catharina Albrecht. He was a princely Council and Mayor in Gera. 3 of their sons, George, Andreas, and Henrich, was employed by Duke Hans, the Elder in Haderslev, Schleswig, Denmark. A daughter also married in Flensburg. A fourth son, Johannes (Hans) became Mayor of Eisenberg. Georg (J√∂rg/J√ºrgen) Beyer, the Younger (c. 1522 to 1587) was Secretary to the Duke Hans, the Elder in 1547, married Magdalena Richertsen in 1553, the daughter of Mayor of Flensborg, Denmark (now Flensburg, Germany). A famous Epitaph of the family is found in St. Mary (St.Marien) Church in Flensburg, Germany. He is also listed in the Danish Dansk Biografisk Leksikon. Many descendants lives in currently in Germany, Denmark, Norway, USA, France, Argentine and Spain. * Ascanius Beyer * Barbara Beyer, married to the Royal Chancellor to the Margrave of Ansbach Leonard Stetner (‚Ä† 1601 in Naumburg) * Johann Beyer became County Commissioner in Altenburg [the city holding the German Supreme Court] Sources * Horst Schlechte: \\"Beyer, Christian\\".

This series of fissures in the Hambleton Hills, near Helmsley, is located on the Western slope above the river Rye. Description Their name is a local one, derived from their tendency to emit gusts of air and steam from their narrow entrances. The phenomenon is caused by warm or cold air rising from the fissures and coming into contact with the air outside the entrance. In winter a steamy vapour rises in puffs or jets from the holes. In warmer months cold air can be felt in the passage entrances, sometimes moving so violently as to vibrate the foliage nearby. There are more than 40 known windypits, but only four windypits have known significant archaeological deposits. These are Antofts, Ashberry, Bucklands and Slip Gill. Due to their geological significance, several of the windypits are designated as SSSIs. The windypits are used as an amenity for cavers and potholers, and are also nationally important swarming and roosting sites for bats. Seven species of bat have been recorded including whiskered Myotis mystacinus, Daubenton's M. daubentoni, Natterer's M. nattereri and brown long-eared Plecotus auritus. All of the Ryedale Windypits are located in or on the edge of woodland or forestry plantation. Exploration The first recorded exploration of a Windypit was by Rev. William Buckland in 1832, and subsequently these caves were explored and partially excavated during the mid-20th century. The human remains from the four Windypits are Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age burials due to their association with the Beaker pottery and flint tools found in the chambers of the fissures. Archaeology In 2011, the BBC's History Cold Case programme featured a team from the Centre of Anatomy and Human Identification at the University of Dundee investigating the site. Their investigation focused on particular on a tangle of 2,000-year-old bones, possibly those of a family, found in Slip Gill Windy Pit in the 1950s. A forensic examination of the bones, revealed evidence that at least one of them had been scalped. Further investigations by the team looked at bones found in neighbouring pits. Those too showed signs of blunt force trauma, confirming inter-personal violence as well as a shin bone which had markings that were consistent with the removal of flesh from bone.

Opened in 1872, it forms the junction between the Vorarlberg railway and the Feldkirch‚ÄìBuchs railway. The station is owned and operated by the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB). Location Feldkirch railway station is situated in Bahnhofplatz, in the northern Feldkirch district of Levis, between the Ardetzenberg and the K√§nzele. History The station was opened on 1 July 1872, together with the rest of the Vorarlberg railway. The original station building was repeatedly extended from 1884, as the Arlberg railway transformed Feldkirch into an international transport hub. In the 1960s, the original station building was torn down. In early 1969, the new building was put into operation. Between 1999 and 2001, the station was renovated and rebuilt again, as part of the √ñBB-Bahnhofsinitiative. The renovation work included replacement of the platforms, the pedestrian underpass and the station building. In 2010, in a survey conducted by the Verkehrsclub √ñsterreich (VC√ñ), the station was nominated by the interviewed passengers as the sixth most beautiful railway station in Austria. Services Feldkirch is one of Vorarlberg's major railway stations. It also serves as a loading station for the motorail train from Feldkirch to Vienna, Graz and Villach. Additionally, Feldkirch is the border station of the line to Buchs; it is the only Austrian border station adjacent to the Principality of Liechtenstein. Notable visitors James Joyce Irish writer James Joyce paid a visit to Feldkirch in 1932 to see his friend Eugene Jolas. During the visit, he said to Jolas, \\"Over there, on those tracks, the fate of Ulysses was decided in 1915.\\" Since Bloomsday 1994, the quote has been displayed in German translation in the station concourse. James Joyce quote display in the Feldkirch station concourse. Joyce had travelled through Feldkirch by train in 1915. Due to World War I, he had been considered an \\"enemy alien\\" in his then home town of Trieste, which, at that time, was part of Austria-Hungary. Thanks to influential friends, he had obtained permission to leave Austria-Hungary, with his partner Nora Barnacle and their two shared children, and travel to Z√ºrich. Meanwhile, his brother Stanislaus Joyce was arrested in Trieste and detained until the end of the war. During border control checks at Feldkirch, the train on which Joyce and Barnacle were travelling was boarded, and passengers inspected by officials; Joyce escaped arrest by a whisker. If Joyce had been arrested then, he would have been unable to write Ulysses in its present form, hence his comment to Jolas. At the end of 2001, the √ñBB replaced a plaque mounted by the Feldkirch culture circle above the ticket counters on Bloomsday 1994 with a more conspicuous presentation of the Joycean literary quotation.  Stefan Zweig  In his memoirs The World of Yesterday (German: Die Welt von Gestern), the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig explained that on 24 March 1919 he had been an eyewitness at Feldkirch railway station, as Charles I of Austria was deported from the Republic of German Austria into exile in Switzerland: See also *History of rail transport in Austria *Rail transport in Austria References Notes Explanatory note Further reading  *  External links  * Nachbaur, Ulrich: Als der Zug langsam in Feldkirch einfuhr - Literary memories of the flight from Austria to Switzerland in early 1938.

Summary The game is based on a then-popular Japanese heavy metal band formed by Damian Hamada called Seikima-II. This band lasted from its creation in 1982 to its dissolution on December 31, 1999. Their history, as it has been prophesied, is that they are a group of demons preaching a religion in order to propagate Satan through the use of Heavy Metal.

He was held in high esteem by the Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller Order, the Bishops of Malta, the Viceroys of Sicily, cardinals, bishops, inquisitors, and the common people. Perhaps the most eminent Maltese philosopher of the Middle Ages, the various extant writings of his are witness to his philosophical aptitude and dexterity as to his high calibre as a philosopher. These qualities were highly appreciated during his lifetime, in Malta as in France and Italy. He lived a busy life, both as an intellectual and as an administrator. He was professor of philosopher at various institutions of high education, an able preacher, and an official at various posts within the Dominican Order, of which his was a member. He was an avid aficionado of music, and was talented with playing musical instruments. Though the fame of holiness accompanied him in his life, this did not deter the Inquisition from suspecting him of heresy, and keeping him in its dungeons for fourteen months. When he died, he was given an almost state funeral. Life Birth and education Rispoli was born in Senglea, Malta, on 17 August 1582, to John Vincent and Catherine.Senglea Parish Baptismal Records, Vol. I, f. 3. He was christened John Mary. His father was a pilot on one of the galleys of the Knights Hospitaller.Bartolomeo Dal Pozzo, Historia della S. Religione Militare di S. Giovanni, detta di Malta, 1764, p. 111. This suggests that the family enjoyed a decent financial income. In fact, Rispoli was given a good education from an early age. A Dominican friar At sixteen years of age, in 1598, Rispoli joined the Dominican Order at the Annunciation Priory of Vittoriosa. He was formally admitted a year later, and given the name John Matthew as a sign of his new religious status. Thereafter, he was sent to Palermo, Sicily, to begin and complete his institutional education at the Dominican Studium Generale there in philosophy and theology. At Paris Rispoli's initial studies ended seven years later, in 1606. Though he returned to Malta to commence his academic and pastoral work, he came under the eye of Alof de Wignacourt, Grand Master to the Knights Hospitaller, who conceded him protection. Most probably, this was due to Rispoli's intellectual capabilities as much as the high esteem in which the Grand Master held his father, whom, as recompense for his thirty-seven years in the service of the Knights Hospitaller, had been elected Donat and Brother in the Order. Whatever the case, the Grand Master personally recommended Rispoli to King Henry IV of France in order to ensue his theological studies at the University of Sorbonne, in Paris.Francesco Azzopardo, Descrittione delli tre Conventi che l'Ordine dei Predicatori tiene nell'Isola di Malta, Archive of the Dominicans, Rabat, Malta, ff. 190v-193, n. 170. Thus Rispoli left almost immediately for France. This gave the twenty-four-year-old Rispoli an opportunity to upgrade his studies at one of the then most illustrious centres of learning in the world, and show his true colours. In fact, as it happened, this opening gave him great prestige throughout his whole life. Rispoli remained in Paris for the next six years. Throughout his stay there he was known as le Jacobin Maltois, the Maltese Dominican (since in France the Dominicans were known as Jacobins because their first convent in Paris was built near the church of Saint Jacques). His outstanding intelligence and erudition can be gauged from the fact that, just over two years into his studies at the Sorbonne, in 1609, the twenty-seven-year-old Rispoli was earmarked to be appointed professor to the seat theology teaching on Lombard's Sentences .Registrum Magister Generalis Ordo Pr√¶dicatorum Augustini Galamini, Archivium Generalis Ordo Pr√¶dicatorum, Rome, Italy, Vol. IV, f. 53, cited by Unfortunately, the professorship was eventually awarded to one of the two French candidates who were presented together with Rispoli, this being solely due to their nationality, since Rispoli was clearly tanto dotto e pi√π di quelli due (by far much brighter than the other two). In the limelight Despite this setback which could have changed his life forever, during that same year (1609) Rispoli published a book which impressed his peers and contemporaries. It was entitled Status Controversi√¶ Pr√¶definitionum et Pr√¶determinationum cum Libero Arbitrio (The State of the Question dealing with the Predefinition and the Predestination of Free Will). Basically, Rispoli concludes that divine grace fully respects human freedom, and does not tarnish it in any way. This conclusion clearly sides with the position of the Dominican Domingo Ba√±ez against the Jesuit Luis Molina in the famous and very often acrimonious controversy on the intervention of divine grace in relation to free will. The work surely did not go unnoticed for, some two years later, in 1611, it threw him in the limelight. It so happened that, in 1611, the General Chapter of the Dominican Order, gathering some 450 Dominicans from across the world, met at Paris. As was the custom, four of the best scholars were chosen to carry out a public disputation, and Rispoli was the first to be given this great honour.Pierre de l'Etoile, Journal du regne de Henri IV, La Haye, 1741, Vol. IV, p. 216, cited in . According to one contemporary, Rispoli's disputation, held on May 15, 1611, was attended by the whole academic world of Paris, the Apostolic Nuntio to the King of France (Roberto Ubaldini), the bishops of Montpellier and Orl√©ans together with a great number of ecclesiastics, and of course the Capitular friars, including the Master of the Dominican Order.Histoire de Louis XIII, Roy de France et de Navarre, Paris, 1616, pp. 100‚Äì103, cited in (following Antonin Mortier, Histoire des Maitres G√©n√©raux de l'Ordre des Fr√©res Pr√©cheurs, Paris, 1913, Vol. VI, p. 160). Rispoli's performance that day left a deep an impression upon his illustrious audience. Eyewitnesses attested that his words were docte et gloriose (brilliant and persuasive),Acta Capituli Generalis, ed. by Benedictus Maria Reichert, Vol. VI, Rome, 1902, p. 160, cited in . and that they were received cum laude (with great praise).Regestra Magistri Ordinis Galamini 1608‚Äì12, Archivium Generalis Ordinis Pr√¶dicatorum, Vol. IV, 51, f. 43, cited in . The impact was so great that the Apostolic Nuntio there and then requested of the Master of the Order that he grants Rispoli the coveted title of Master of Sacred Theology.Azzopardo, Descrittione delli tre Conventi che l'Ordine dei Predicatori tiene nell'Isola di Malta, f. 191, cited in . He was only twenty-nine years old. Academic posts Such a success catapulted Rispoli to the highest ranks of learned Dominicans. Only a few months after his Paris disputation, in 1612, to show his delight in championing such a first rate scholar, and in respect towards his family, for all its worth Grand Master Alof de Wignacourt appointed him his personal theologian and consultor, and made him a familiar of the Order of Knights Hospitaller.National Library of Malta, Archives of the Order of St. John, 458, Familiaritas pro Ven. Fr. Jo. Mattheo Rispolo, ff. 292v-293, cited in Upon terminating his studies in Paris in 1612, Rispoli was also on great demand at the many Studia Generali of the Dominican Order. That same year, the General Chapter of Paris appointed him Regent of Studies at the newly established Studium Generale of Messina,Acta Capituli Generalis, ed. by Benedictus Maria Reichert, Vol. VI, Rome, 1902, p. 214Regestra Magistri Ordinis Galamini 1608‚Äì12, Archivium Generalis Ordinis Pr√¶dicatorum, Vol. IV, f. 121, both cited in . Sicily. Then, in 1613, not having yet completed his one-year assignment at Messina, the Provincial Chapter of Sicily, celebrated at Palermo, appointed him Regent at the Studium Generale of Palermo.Regestra Magistri Ordinis Sicci 1612‚Äì14, Archivium Generalis Ordinis Pr√¶dicatorum, Vol. IV, 58, ff. 12v and 25v, cited in . He stayed at the Sicilian capital city up till 1617. Accused of heresy During his Regency at Palermo, between 1615 and 1616, he was accused before the Sicilian Inquisition of teaching heretical doctrines. The precise imputations against Rispoli are not known. It appears that the records of the Inquisition at Palermo have not survived the ravishes of time.. However, it seems that Rispoli's accusers were numerous and powerful, and that the accusations were quite serious.Azzopardo, Descrittione delli tre Conventi che l'Ordine dei Predicatori tiene nell'Isola di Malta, f. 191, cited by . Expenses for a defence lawyer were shared between Rispoli's religious communities at Palermo and at Vittoriosa.Dominican Archive at Vittoriosa, Malta, Quietanze 1605 et. seq., August 1616, cited by . The most heart-rending upshot of the incident was that, between May 1615 and July 1616, pending the charges, Rispoli was incarcerated at one of the Inquisition's dungeons for fourteen months. Eventually, his accusations were proved to be unfounded. He was thus declared not guilty, released, and, on July 15, 1616, reinstated to his former offices.Archivium Generalis Ordo Pr√¶dicatorum, Rome, Italy, Vol. IV, 60, f. 107, extracted by Stephen Forte, notes relevant to Johannes Mattheus Rispoli, Archive of the Maltese Dominican Province, Rabat, Malta. Reinstated Having overcome this harrowing ordeal, Rispoli continued to hold the Regency at the Studium Generale of Palermo for another year. In 1617, after an absence of eighteen years, he was back to Malta as superior (of Vicar-General) of the Maltese Dominicans, and as official Visitor for the three Dominican Priories in Malta on behalf of the Sicilian Prior Provincial.Notarial Archive, Valletta, Malta, Deeds of Notary A. Albano, R12/22, f. 293 (June 3, 1617), f. 455 (May 22, 1618), f. 711 (September 28, 1619) and f. 833 (April 26, 1620), cited in . During his stay in Malta, for one academic year (1617‚Äì18) Rispoli lectured at the Studium of the Portus Salutis Priory at Valletta, and, during the following academic year (1618‚Äì19), at the Dominican Studium of the Annunciation Priory at Vittoriosa. Here, at Vittoriosa, he was also chosen at Master of Studies,Notarial Archive, Valletta, Malta, Deeds of Notary S.

Grand Master Alof de Wignacourt attests to Rispoli's excellent conduct at the time. Already in 1617, when Rispoli returned to Malta, he immediately appointed him as his personal theologian and consultor.Francesco Abela, Descrittione di Malta, Malta, 1647, p. 518, cited in . Now, two years later, he sent various letters to the Master of the Dominican Order and to the Prior Provincial of Sicily most probably to scotch current rumours about some alleged shortcomings on the part of Rispoli. The Grand Master referred to Rispoli's work and personal demeanour in glowing terms, praising his erudition and exemplary life, his prudence and charity shown in his administrative role, his good sense in the works and benefices with which he endowed the priory, and his high standards of strict observance within his religious community.National Library of Malta, Archives of the Order of St. John, 1398, letters dated April 9 and October 2, 1619National Library of Malta, Archives of the Order of St. John, 1399, letter dated November 30, 1620National Library of Malta, Archives of the Order of St. John, 1400, letter dated April 19, 1621. While at Vittoriosa during the years 1618‚Äì20, Rispoli was also appointed Moderator and Consultor to the Inquisition in Malta. How ironical for a man who, barely two years before, has been held captive for more than a year at the dungeons of the Sicilian Inquisition! High activity The latter years of Rispoli's life were rather hectic. He frequently had to travel by sea and land between and over Italy, France, Sicily and Malta, occupying a series of temporary abodes. Rispoli left Malta for Italy in 1623 to take up the office of Regent of Studies at the College of San Sisto Vecchio in Rome, Italy. He stayed here for two years, until 1626.Archivium Generalis Ordo Pr√¶dicatorum, Rome, Italy, Vol. IV, 63, cited in . During this period, precisely in 1624, he was appointed by the Master of the Order, Seraphim Secchi, as Censor for a particular case dealing with a book, entitled Vox Turturis (A Dove's Voice), by the Dominican Dominic Gravina. In 1626, Rispoli was back to Malta for a few months once more as Vicar-General of the Maltese Dominicans, and as official Visitor for the three Dominican Priories in Malta.Azzopardo, Descrittione delli tre Conventi che l'Ordine dei Predicatori tiene nell'Isola di Malta, f. 191v, cited in . In November of this year he was back in Rome, probably as Socius (or Assistant) to the Master of the Order.Registrum Magister Generalis Ordo Pr√¶dicatorum Serafinus Secchi, Archivium Generalis Ordo Pr√¶dicatorum, Rome, Italy, Vol. IV, 63, cited in (following Matteo Coniglioni). At the end of 1626 the Archbishop of Osimo, Italy, Augustine Galamini (who, one might recall, had presided as Master of the Dominican Order over Rispoli's disputation at Paris in May 1611; he had been created Cardinal in August 1611, and Archbishop of Osimo in April 1920), requested that Rispoli serves as his Vicar-General. This appointment probably lasted until 1629.Francesco Abela, Descrittione di Malta, Malta, 1647, p. 518Joseph Zammit, Elogia Illustrium Virorum Melitensium, n. 102, p. 293, cited and commented in During this period, it appears that Rispoli was not residing continually at Osimo. In 1628 he attended the General Chapter of the Dominican Order at Toulouse, France, as Definitor.Acta Capituli Generalis, ed. by Benedictus Maria Reichert, Vol. VI, Rome, 1902, p. 353, cited in . The following year he preached at Macerata, Italy. In May 1930, Rispoli was appointed by the Master of the Dominican Order to act as Commissioner to restore regular life at the priory at Messina, Sicily.Registrum Provinci√¶ Sicili√¶, Archivium Generalis Ordo Pr√¶dicatorum, Rome, Italy, Vol. XIII, 798, cited in . On April 21, 1630, he was than appointed for the third time Vicar- General of the Maltese Dominicans, and as official Visitor for the three Dominican Priories in Malta.Registrum Magister Generalis Ordo Pr√¶dicatorum Niccol√≤ Ridolfi, 1630‚Äì37, f. 116, Archivium Generalis Ordo Pr√¶dicatorum, Rome, Italy, Vol. IV, 70 He stayed in Malta until 1632. In that year, precisely on May 22, 1632, Rispoli was once more appointed Regent of Studies at Palermo, Sicily.Registrum Vicarii Generalis 1628‚Äì32, f. 36, Archivium Generalis Ordo Pr√¶dicatorum, Rome, Italy, Vol. IV, 66, cited in . However, he did not take up office until September, apparently because the Sicilian Prior Provincial had found some objection in the appointmentRegistrum Vicarii Generalis 1628‚Äì32, f. 39v., cited in . He stayed in office until 1936, when he returned to Malta, once more as Vicar-General of the Maltese Dominicans, and as official Visitor for the three Dominican Priories in Malta on behalf of the Sicilian Prior Provincial. During this period, Rispoli also lectured in Holy Scripture and morals at the Cathedral of Mdina, Malta.Museum of the Cathedral, Mdina, Malta, Archive of the Mdina Cathedral, Misc. 275, Repertorium Mandatorum, B, Compendio dei Mandati, 1587‚Äì1645, ff. 71-72v, passim, cited by . In 1638, Rispoli was elected Prior of the community at Valletta.Pelagio, Catalogo cronologico dei Scrittori Maltesi, Stromatum Melitensium, Vol. II, collected by John Xavier Mifsud, 1752, National Library of Malta, Malta, n. 16, f. 224, cited in . This was his last assignment in Malta. Death In March 1639, Rispoli was in Catania, Sicily, where he went to preach Lenten sermons at the Cathedral. It seems that, during the rough 93 km crossing between Malta and Sicily, he caught an ugly chill.Azzopardo, Descrittione delli tre Conventi che l'Ordine dei Predicatori tiene nell'Isola di Malta, f. 192v, cited in . Unwilling to rest or take time to convalescent, Rispoli plod through the sermons of the first couple of days. On April 1, after the appointed sermon, he feverishly took to bed unable to rise again. His condition worsened during the night, and died the day after, on April 2, 1639. His funeral in Catania was held four days later (April 6). Though technically just a simple friar, Rispoli was given a state funeral in everything but name.John Baptist de Grossis, Catanense Decachordum, Catania, Sicily, 1642, Vol. I, p. 144, cited in . Chroniclers were impressed by the multitude of people, both common and dignitaries, who attended his service and interment. He was buried at the Dominican church of St. Catherine, Catania, in a grave reserved for all friars. Unfortunately, in the subsequent years, through war and natural disasters, the church was destroyed, and the burial place lost. Today, only the original plaque which covered the grave still exists. Posthumous recognition Considering the outstanding intellectual and personal qualities of Rispoli, relatively little academic attention has been given to him, and much less to his philosophy. The only genuine biographical research carried out on original sources was done by Daniel Callus in the 1920s. Subsequent scholars heavily relied on his work, adding here and there some further unsubstantial information.This was mainly done by Michael Fsadni and Mark Montebello. Unfortunately, in general the academia ignored Rispoli, perhaps considering him just another withered mediaeval scholastic who, apart from some historical value, had no particular consequence or philosophical relevance to contemporary discussions. Rispoli's works have never been meticulously or systematically studied. None of them have ever been translated, in part or in whole, into a modern language, let alone freshly read and studied. Indeed, the translation of his works, or even the transliteration of his manuscripts, is riddled with logistical problems. Most of the manuscripts (perhaps excluding the Commentaria of 1633) are written in a minuscule, mostly indecipherable, handwriting. Furthermore, they are peppered with inscrutable abbreviations. Of course, all of this does not apply to his Status Controversi√¶ of 1609, which is his only extant printed text, and which might possibly contain the best of his philosophy and originality. As Rispoli's personality continues to attract attention, the eventual study of his philosophy is not a forlorn prospect. Works Frontispiece of Rispoli's 1609 magnum opus All of Rispoli's works attest to his Aristotelian-Thomist type of philosophy. Basically, Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas are his main sources, and his writing style is heavily influenced by the method of composition proper to Scholasticism. For this reason, most of his works are organised into 'Books', 'Chapters', 'Questions', and 'Conclusions'. Rispoli's extant writings are sixteen in all. They are of three types: (1) one published book; (2) fourteen endorsed manuscripts; and (3) one authored manuscript. Published book Rispoli published just one book in his lifetime, and that was at the beginning of his academic and intellectual career. Copies of the publication are extremely rare. Two are known to exist, one is at the Dominican Archive at Rabat, Malta, and another at the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France in Paris, France. * 1609 ‚Äì Status Controversi√¶ Pr√¶definitionum et Pr√¶determinationum cum Libero Arbitrio (The State of the Question dealing with the Predefinition and the Predestination of Free Will). The book, in Latin, was published on June 15, 1609, by Reginald Chaudi√®re, Paris. It contains twenty-two introductory pages (Roman numbering) and 424 body pages (Arabic numbering), and measures 17 cm x 10.5 cm. It was published cum privilegio Regis (by appointment of the King). Endorsed manuscripts These fourteen manuscripts are all held at the Dominican Archive at Rabat, Malta. They were put in writing by a cleric, John Mary Camilleri, who attended Rispoli's lectures, and presumably sanctioned for their accuracy by Rispoli himself (for they were in his possession). Some of the lectures were read at the Dominican Studium of the Portus Salutis Priory at Valletta, Malta, and others at the Dominican Studium of the Annunciation Priory at Vittoriosa, Malta. They are the following: * c.1617 ‚Äì Tractatus Summularum (A Short Treatise on Logic). * 1617 ‚Äì Expositio Librorum Pr√¶dicabilium (An Exposition on Aristotle's 'Categories'). * 1617 ‚Äì In Aristotelis Pr√¶dicamenta Expositio (An Exposition on Aristotle's 'Categories'). * 1617 ‚Äì In Libros Posteriorum Aristotelis Expositio (An Exposition on Aristotle's 'Posterior Analytics'). * 1618/19 ‚Äì Qu√¶stiones in Libros De Anima (Themes related to Aristotle's 'On the Soul'). * 1618 ‚Äì Subtilissima Expositio In Octo Libros Aristotelis Physicorum (A Detailed Exposition on the Eight Books of Aristotle's 'Physics'). * 1619 ‚Äì Expositio In Libros Aristotelis De Generatione et Corruptione (An Exposition on the Books of Aristotle's 'On Coming-To-Be and Passing Away'). * 1619 ‚Äì Expositio in Tractatum De Ente et Essentia Divi Thom√¶ (An Exposition on Aquinas' Treatise 'On Being and Essence'). * c.1631 ‚Äì Summa Totius Logicae (An Anthology on Logic). * c.1631 ‚Äì Comentarium in Libros De Anima (A Commentary on the Books of Aristotle's 'On the Soul'). * c.1631 ‚Äì Tractatus De Sensibus (A Treatise on the Senses). * c.1631 ‚Äì Tractatus De Potentia (A Treatise on Potency). * c.1631 ‚Äì Liber Primus De Generatione (On the First Book of Aristotle's 'On Coming-To-Be and Passing Away'). * c.1631 ‚Äì Summa Librorum Physicorum (An Anthology on Physics). Authored work This manuscript was discovered by Mark Montebello in 1992, and as yet remains the last of Rispoli's work to be located. It is held at the Commune Library of the Municipality of Palermo in Sicily. The special and precious feature of this document is that it is the only manuscript personally penned down by Rispoli himself. * 1633 ‚Äì Commentaria in Primam Partem Divi Thom√¶ (A Commentary on the First Part of Aquinas' 'Summa Theologi√¶').

It was Tischendorf's eighth edition of the Greek Testament, and the most important, published between 1864 and 1894. Edition The first volume was issued in 11 parts, beginning in 1864. They were published in two volumes in 1869 and 1872. The edition was accompanied by a rich critical apparatus in which he assembled all of the variant readings that he or his predecessors had found in manuscripts, versions, and fathers. Tischendorf died before he could finish his edition, and the third volume, containing the Prolegomena, was prepared and edited by C. R. Gregory and issued in three parts (1884, 1890, 1894). Tischendorf gave the evidence known in his time. He used 64 uncial manuscripts, a single papyrus manuscript, and a small number of minuscule manuscripts. He could not verify everything he cited and sometimes in his apparatus he gives notations such as \\"copms ap Mill et Wtst\\", i.e. \\"Coptic manuscript according to Mill and Westtstein\\". The manuscripts are cited completely and accurately. The number of inaccuracies is smaller than in 20th-century manual editions. Tischendorf did not have a detailed textual theory. In practice he had a strong preference for the readings of the manuscript of his own discovery ‚Äì Codex Sinaiticus. His text is eclectic but generally the Alexandrian. It has also something from the Western text-type, especially when it agrees with Codex Bezae.Robert Waltz, Tischendorf's Apparatus At the beginning of his work Tischendorf had practically no access to Codex Vaticanus, and it was published too late to alter the basic structure of Tischendorf's edition.  Influence  Tischendorf's Editio Octava and The New Testament in the Original Greek of Westcott and Hort were sufficient to make the Textus Receptus obsolete for the scholarly world. According to Eberhard Nestle the text of the eighth edition differs from the seventh edition in 3,572 places. Nestle has accused this edition of giving weight to the evidence of Codex Sinaiticus. Nestle used Editio octava in his Novum Testamentum Graece for its extensive representation of the manuscript tradition and Westcott-Hort's text for its development of the methodology of the Textual Criticism.Barbara Aland and Beate K√ºster, The Nestle Edition at the Bible Resource Center Nestle called Tischendorf's edition \\"the most complete survey of what has been done on the Greek New Testament up to the present time\\". The edition was reprinted in 1965. According to Kurt Aland even a century later it was still of value for scholarly research. Tischendorf proposed his own critical apparatus ‚Äì symbols and abbreviations ‚Äì in this work.Kirsopp Lake, The Text of the New Testament (London 1908), pp. 92-93. The critical apparatus used in Editio Octava is still used by some textual critics.Philip Comfort, Encountering the manuscripts: an introduction to New Testament paleography, B&H; Publishing Group, Nashville, 2005, p. 99.

D-amino acid amides and methyl esters also are hydrolyzed, as is glycine amide. It is a dimeric enzyme with each monomer being composed of three domains. Domain B is organised to form a beta barrel made up of eight antiparallel beta strands. It is connected to domain A, the catalytic domain, by an eight-residue sequence, and also interacts with both domains A and C via non-covalent bonds. Domain B probably functions in maintaining domain C in a good position to interact with the catalytic domain. Domain C is organised to form a beta barrel made up of eight antiparallel beta strands. It is connected to domain B by a short linker sequence, and interacts extensively with the domain A, the catalytic domain. The gamma loop of domain C forms part of the wall of the catalytic pocket; domain C is in fact thought to confer substrate and inhibitor specificity to the enzyme.

Founded by Robert C. Sproul in 1958, the company generally imitated other publishers' successes in various genres, such as Westerns, men's adventure, and the Warren Publications mid-1960s revival of horror comics. Even as the company chased publishing trends, its long-running flagship title was Cracked, which the company published from 1958‚Äì1985. The company also published a number of monster-themed magazines, imitating publications like Fangoria and Famous Monsters of Filmland. Editor Terry Bisson recalled:  History   Cracked  Cracked's first editor was Sol Brodsky. Over the years, Bill Ward and John Severin were regular contributors to most of the company's publications. The production manager throughout the 1960s was Charles Foster. In addition to the flagship title, Major put out a number of publications under the Cracked umbrella, including Cracked Collector's Edition, Giant Cracked, and Super Cracked. Many Cracked contributors worked on these titles.  Web of Horror  The most notable of Major's black-and-white horror magazines was Web of Horror, edited by Bisson, which published three issues from 1969‚Äì1970. Bruce Jones made his professional debut in Web of Horror #3, writing and drawing the six-page story \\"Point of View.\\" Wayne Howard contributed to issue #1.

Portland has been known as the City of Roses, or Rose City, since 1888, after Madame Caroline Testout, a large pink variety of hybrid tea rose bred in France, was introduced to the city. Thousands of rose bushes were planted, eventually lining of Portland's streets in preparation for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in 1905. The Rose City Park neighborhood in northeast Portland was formed in 1907, the same year of the first annual Portland Rose Festival. During World War I, nursery owners in Portland began planning a large rose garden to protect European rose species from the war. The garden was established in Washington Park as the International Rose Test Garden in 1917. Today, the Portland Rose Festival takes place each June with a carnival, parades, and navy ships docked along the Tom McCall Waterfront Park to promote the city. The International Rose Test Garden is currently one of the oldest public rose test gardens in the United States, covering with over 8,000 rose plants, and more than 550 different species. In 2003, Portland adopted the \\"City of Roses\\" as its official nickname. History In 1888, Georgiana Burton Pittock, the wife of Oregon newspaper publisher and business tycoon Henry Pittock, invited friends and neighbors to display their roses in a tent set up in her garden in the area now known as Pittock Block. In 1889, lawyer and civic leader Frederick Van Voorhies Holman helped found the Portland Rose Society. The rose cultivar Mme. Caroline Testout, a hybrid tea rose variety named after a French dressmaker, was introduced by French rosarian Joseph Pernet-Ducher in 1890. The cultivar gained popularity, and by 1905 Portland had of rose-bordered streets, with about half-a-million rose bushes planted, attracting visitors to the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition.Chasing The Rose, Andrea di Robilant, Knopf, 2014, p. 91 In 1915, rose hobbyist and Oregon Journal editor Jesse Currey convinced city officials to establish a rose test garden to protect hybrid roses grown in Europe during World War I. Portland's Park Bureau approved the idea in 1917, allowing rose enthusiasts in England to send roses to Portland for preservation. City landscape architect Florence Holmes Gerke began designing the International Rose Test Garden and accompanying amphitheatre in 1921. The garden was dedicated in June 1924 with Currey as the first curator. He served until his death in 1927. A stone bench in the garden honors Currey's work as founder. City of Roses Portland mayor Harry Lane said in 1905 that the city needed a \\"festival of roses\\". The official and most common nickname for Portland is the \\"City of Roses\\", or \\"Rose City\\". According to Charles Paul Keyser, Portland Parks Superintendent from 1917 to 1950, the first known reference to Portland as \\"The City of Roses\\" was made by visitors at an Episcopal Church convention in 1888. The city's first annual rose show was held the following year, and by 1904, the Portland Rose Society began sponsoring fiestas to accompany the shows. The nickname grew in popularity after the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, when mayor Harry Lane suggested that the city needed a \\"festival of roses\\". The first Portland Rose Festival was held two years later and remains the city's major annual festival a century later. The Portland Rose Society, which offers educational programs on \\"rose culture\\" and advocates the use of roses in the landscape, remains in operation today. In Portland, the nickname is often attributed to Leo Samuel, who founded the Oregon Life Insurance Company in 1906 (known today as Standard Insurance Company). Samuel grew roses outside his home and placed a pair of shears outside his garden, so people could snip a rose from his garden to take for themselves. On June 18, 2003, the city council unanimously approved a resolution adopting \\"the City of Roses\\" as the city's official nickname. Gardens The International Rose Test Garden in 2010. Many rose gardens are found throughout Portland, the most prominent of which is the International Rose Test Garden. Peninsula Park became the city's first public rose garden in 1909 when it was purchased for $60,000 ($ in ) with funds raised in a 1908 bond measure. Designed by Emanuel L. Mische, the garden contains 8,900 plantings featuring 65 rose varieties. Mme. Caroline Testout, the official rose of Portland, was grown at Peninsula Park. In 1913, the park was chosen as the location for an annual rose show, where it remained until Washington Park was selected as the location of the International Rose Test Garden in 1917. The park remains a popular Portland tourist destination, with more than 9,500 rose bushes representing over 600 varieties. The Ladd's Addition neighborhood contains four diamond-shaped rose gardens originally designed by William Sargent Ladd in the 1890s. Emanuel Mische designed landscaped areas in the park in 1909. Mische planted roses in the diamond gardens giving it a \\"stained glass effect\\". The park was acquired by Portland Parks & Recreation in 1981 and currently features 3,000 roses representing sixty varieties that were popular in the early 20th century. Other rose gardens surrounding the Portland metropolitan area include Esther Short Park in Vancouver, Washington, Avery Park Rose Garden in Corvallis, Owen Rose Garden in Eugene, and Heirloom Roses in St. Paul. Events The Portland Rose Festival is an annual civic festival held during the month of June. Events, including multiple parades, a carnival, fleet week, and the crowning of a queen, are organized by the volunteer non-profit Portland Rose Festival Association with the purpose of promoting the Portland region. Coinciding with the festival is the Annual Spring Rose Show, considered to be one of the largest and longest-running in the nation. The Portland's Best Rose event, sponsored by the Portland Rose Society, began in 1996. The competition includes 100 judges ranking varieties in a blind contest. One day prior to the competition, the public is invited to vote for the People's Choice award recipient. Local namesakes Visitors Information Center. Rose City Park is a neighborhood and park in northeast Portland. The neighborhood formed in 1907, the year of the first Portland Rose Festival. The headquarters of the rose festival are at the Visitors Information Center, also known as the Rose Building. The building was designed by architect John Yeon in 1948 and served as a chamber of commerce office and visitor center, city offices, and a restaurant, as well as the rose festival's headquarters. Located along Tom McCall Waterfront Park, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010 and features a rose garden and neon rose sign. Other namesakes include murals depicting roses painted on sides of buildings in Portland, and the private company Rose City Transit, which provided most mass transit service in Portland from 1956 to 1969. The Moda Center, formerly known as the Rose Garden, is home to the Portland Trail Blazers. Roses have long been associated with sports in Portland. The Moda Center, known as the Rose Garden for many years, is an indoor sports arena in the Rose Quarter, a sports and entertainment center in the Lloyd District neighborhood. The venue was one of the last National Basketball Association (NBA) facilities to have its naming rights sold. In addition, three professional sports teams were named the Portland Rosebuds during the first half of the 20th century; they were two professional men's ice hockey teams that played home games at the Portland Ice Arena and one Negro league baseball team in the West Coast Baseball Association that was also known as the \\"Portland Roses\\". The first hockey team played in the Pacific Coast Hockey Association from 1914‚Äì1918. During the 1915‚Äì1916 season the Rosebuds became the first American team to participate in the Stanley Cup finals. The second hockey team played in the Western Hockey League's fifth and final season (1925‚Äì1926). Other teams have incorporated the \\"Rose City\\" nickname into their brand. The Rose City Rollers, an all-female roller derby league within the Women's Flat Track Derby Association, was established in 2004 and supports four local teams and two traveling teams. The Rollers support a junior league known as the Rosebuds. Two women's professional football teams have been named the Rose City Wildcats, the first formed for the 2001 season of the Women's American Football League and the second for the 2011 season of the Women's Spring Football League. A women's soccer team named the Portland Thorns FC was formed in 2012 by the Portland Timbers and have played in the National Women's Soccer League since 2013.

The land was granted to the Armenian-Cypriot community by the colonial government of Cyprus in 1946, but did not become operational until July 1960, because of the Law that stipulated that cemeteries need to have a wall separating them from their surrounding area. This wall was constructed by donation of the then Mayor of Limassol, Costas Partasides, who was a member of AKEL. Until then, deceased Armenian-Cypriots from Limassol were buried primarily in Nicosia or Larnaca. About 150 burials have taken place at this cemetery, covering less than an eighth of its total area. In 2003, due to the widening of the Limassol-Platres road, about 20 tombs were moved westwards.

It is found in eastern North America where it is found in slower moving and still waters.  Taxonomy and etymology  The bluntnose darter was first formally described by the American Oliver Perry Hay (1846-1930) with the type locality given as the Cullasaja River at Macon County, North Carolina. The generic name Etheostoma derives from Greek , \\"to strain\\", and stoma, \\"mouth\\". The specific name chlorosomum is Greek for \\"greenish-yellow\\".  Description  Bluntnose darters attain a size of up to . the species has a diagnostic very round, blunt snout. Its color is light yellow or olive dorsally with either dark brown or black spots or uneven dense lines. The belly is white. The flanks bear W-shaped marks . The area in front of the eyes consists of continuous black bars around the snout. This barring also slightly extends onto the upper lip. The dorsal and caudal fins have some pigment in light brown bands, while the other fins are clear. There is a single anal spine. The opercle, cheek, and prepectoral area are scaled, while the breast may be fully or partially scaled. Scales may be embedded. The belly is either fully scaled or scaled posteriorly and unscaled anteriorly. Bluntnose darters have an incomplete lateral line. During breeding, males take on a darker or dusky breeding coloration, induced by melanophores unevenly distributed throughout the fins, and on the underside of the body. Breeding tubercles develop on the pelvic and anal fins. Females develop a large, spatulate genital papillae.  Distribution and habitat  The species occurs in North America from the San Antonio Bay drainage in Texas east to Mississippi, Alabama and Indiana, and north to Minnesota. It was formerly present in the Lake Michigan drainage area. In Louisiana, the bluntnose darter is one of the most widely distributed darters and is found in all river drainages, but it is absent in the southernmost estuarine environments. The species is found in swamps, floodplain lakes, sloughs, and low-gradient creeks, often over substrates of mud, clay or detritus. It can be found in large rivers, where it most often occupies backwaters.  Diet  In specimens found in Tennessee, the bluntnose darter's diet was made up of aquatic insects such as caddisfly larvae, dytiscid beetles, and midge larvae.  Reproduction and life cycle  The lifespan of the bluntnose darter is likely about three years. Spawning occurs at different times of year throughout the range; in Texas, a spawning period from early January to late March has been observed, April in Kansas, and March and April in Louisiana. Males court females in displays that include of posing while quivering with upright fins. The spawning site is chosen by the female. She usually selects algae, dead leaves, or a small twig. Males mount the females for fertilization, only fertilizing 1-3 eggs per attempt. Larval development of the bluntnose darter has not yet been described.

Although it was designed in response to a specification issued by British European Airways (BEA), the Type 200 was larger than the airline's requirements and was closer to the Boeing 727 in size and range. The project was cancelled when BEA selected the Hawker Siddeley Trident instead. The Trident went on to have a production run of 117, while the 727 had a production run of over 1800. Along with the Vickers V-1000, it is seen by some as one of the great \\"what ifs\\" of British aviation, although it never got beyond the drawing board. Development In 1955 BEA issued a specification for an aircraft to replace its Vickers Viscount and Vickers Vanguard turboprop airliners. The airline's requirements were for an aeroplane that could carry a payload of 100 passengers over a range of . Along with the Bristol Aeroplane Company, de Havilland, Avro and Vickers proposed designs based around BEA's specification, but the B200 was the only Trijet proposal and it won the competition. De Havilland, however, were in trouble after the Comet disaster but Bristols had a full workload. The British government asked Bristol to share the B200 work with DH and, in return, were promised the government's support on their Type 188 Mach 2 fighter project. The two companies worked together unhappily for about six months and it was obvious that they were not compatible. The government then required DH to form another company large enough to continue the development without Bristol's involvement. Accordingly, \\"Airco\\" was formed by DH. A number of European and American airlines became interested in the aircraft and Boeing were aware of this. BEA then decided that after all the B200 design was over-large for its needs and requested that the aircraft be scaled down and this smaller version became known as the Trident. Boeing saw this scaling-down as a mistake and took the initiative of developing the Boeing 727 as almost a B200 replica. History recalls that BEA and DH subsequently realised that the scaling-down had been a costly mistake and DH hurriedly set about a \\"scaling up\\" exercise to form Tridents 2 and 3 derivatives. But the market had by then been lost to DH and captured by Boeing with large sales for its 727. The design of the Type 200 was marginally larger than the specifications that were issued by BEA. This reflected the opinion of Archibald Russell (chief designer at Bristol) and his team, who believed that a larger aircraft had better potential in the international market. The Type 200 was close to the Boeing 727 in size and range. The project attracted interest from various European and American airlines, including Pan Am, who invited senior members of the design team to a meeting in the US. Under pressure from the British government to merge with other aerospace companies, Bristol collaborated with Hawker Siddeley on the Type 200, but ultimately in 1958 BEA selected the Trident and the Type 200 was cancelled. Design The design had three engines mounted at the rear of the fuselage, one on either side and one in the fin. The empennage was a T-tail arrangement to keep the horizontal stabiliser above the central engine. The Type 200 was the first design to have this T-tail trijet configuration, which was later used successfully on several aircraft (see Boeing 727, Hawker Siddeley Trident, Tupolev Tu-154). There was speculation about several engines that might have been used on the aircraft, including the Bristol Orpheus turbojet, The Bristol Olympus, the Rolls Royce RB.140/RB.141 (Medway)\\"The Aeroplane\\" Volume 94, 1958. or even Pratt & Whitney's J57. Further development Bristol developed several other concepts based on the Type 200, none of which was ever built. The Type 201 was a long-range version of the aircraft, proposed for BOAC in 1956. The Type 205 was a short-range version with four engines mounted at the rear of the fuselage, similar to the Vickers VC10. The Type 200 and its related developments were later used to contribute to the design of the BAC 1-11 (along with the Hunting 107 design).

He may have attended Marietta College of Ohio. In 1831 and 1832, he was in Pine Grove Furnace, Ohio as a storekeeper. He studied law under Nelson Barrere and was admitted to the bar in 1835. He located in Portsmouth for a few months, and then in Cincinnati until 1838. In 1838, McCormick became Prosecuting Attorney of Adams County. Again in 1843, first by appointment, and then by election, was again prosecutor until 1845. On May 20, 1840, he was married to Elizabeth Smith, sister of Judge John M. Smith of West Union. They had two sons and one daughter, but only Adam Ellison, born 1843, survived to adulthood. Joseph McCormick was an alcoholic, and, when his father died in 1849, he left a large estate. He left a life estate to Joseph, with the remainder to the two grandchildren then alive. He directed the trustee of the estate to turn over the entire estate to Joseph should he reform his drinking habit. The estate was held in trust until Joseph's death, when it was turned over to his son. McCormick was elected from Adams County to the second Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1850. On May 5, 1851, he was appointed by Governor Reuben Wood as the second Ohio Attorney General, to replace Henry Stanbery, whose term had expired. He served about seven months, until George E. Pugh, who was elected under the new constitution, assumed the office. In about 1857, McCormick went to California, where he died in 1879.

A well-cemented sandstone of nearly pure quartz, in the 19th century it was widely used in construction and in refractory linings for iron furnaces.James Carl, Potsdam Sandstone: Composition and Qualities, Potsdam Public Museum website, accessed July 29, 2011 Name and type locality Potsdam Sandstone outcrop along the Raquette River The Potsdam Sandstone is named for its type locality in Potsdam, New York, where in 1838 Ebenezer Emmons described it in outcrops along the Raquette River.Geologic Unit: Potsdam, U.S. Geological Survey Geolex Database, accessed August 1, 2011James Carl, Potsdam Sandstone: Bedrock Geology, Potsdam Public Museum website, accessed July 29, 2011 Stratigraphic setting and lithology Unconformity at the base of the Potsdam Sandstone The Potsdam Sandstone lies unconformably on a surface of Precambrian metamorphic rock. It is the earliest unit in the marine-transgressive sedimentary rock sequence deposited during the early Paleozoic as sea level rose to gradually inundate the craton of the paleocontinent of Laurentia. The rock, which is formed from sediments eroded off unvegetated terrestrial landscapes and deposited in near- shore coastal environments, consists almost entirely of sand-size quartz grains held together by quartz cement. It ranges in color from gray to tan, yellow, and red, with the colors imparted by small amounts of the red iron oxide mineral hematite, Fe2O3, and the yellow iron oxide mineral goethite, FeO(OH). As sea level rose in the depositional environment, increasing amounts of carbonate minerals were deposited in the sediment, with the result that the unit grades upward into dolomitic sandstone in the upper Potsdam and then to sandy dolomite at the base of the overlying Theresa Formation.Mineral Resources On-Line Spatial Data: Theresa Formation, U.S. Geological Survey Geolex, accessed August 6, 2011 Paleontology Protichnites in the lower Potsdam Sandstone. Diplocraterion in the upper Potsdam Sandstone. Fossil remains of whole animals are rare in the Potsdam Sandstone, but there are some significant occurrences of trace fossils.

Geographic occurrence In New York state, the Potsdam is found primarily north and west of the Adirondack Mountains. Outcrop exposures of the Potsdam Sandstone occur throughout the Saint Lawrence lowlands, western Lake Champlain Valley, and northern Mohawk Valley. Ausable Chasm, near Plattsburgh, has a continuous exposure of a section more than thick.James W. Hagadorn and Edward S.

Uses in construction and industry In the 19th century, Potsdam Sandstone was highly regarded as a building material. There was extensive quarrying for Potsdam Sandstone in the Potsdam area, beginning in 1809.The Potsdam Red Sandstone quarries, Scientific American, January 7, 1893, page 8-10. Properties of the rock that give it value as a building material include high compressive strength, attractive reddish coloring, and resistance to weathering. The rock also was said to be \\"soft and easy to carve\\" when freshly quarried but \\"extremely hard\\" and \\"weather-resistant\\" after exposure to the air, but modern geologists suggest that this is a misconception. Potsdam Sandstone resists spalling when exposed to fire, making it highly suitable for use as a refractory for lining iron furnaces.

It is endemic to the eastern United States. Description The Coosa darter is a robust species of darter which can be identified by having a blunt snout with a small mouth. The spiny part of its dorsal fin is marked with bands of color and has a central red band along the whole of its length, although it does not posses the anterior ocellus found in many other species in the subgenus Ulocentra. Above and below this central band there are alternating clear and dark bans. In the soft-rayed part of the dorsal fin, the middle part of the membranes between each ray is red. The color of the body is yellow-olive, marked with 8-9 dark blotches located dorsally and on the flanks. The lower snout and the throat are pale green, while the anal fin and upper and lower lobes of the caudal fin are turquoise. The blotches along the flank have a slightly green hue. The maximum recorded total length for this species is , although the standard length of males is more commonly around and of females . Distribution The Coosa darter is only found in the Coosa River system, which drains into Mobile Bay in Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee. Habitat and biology The Coosa darter is found in rocky pools and nearby riffles of creeks and small to medium rivers, as well as in streams. It feeds mainly on the larvae of midge and blackfly larvae, with smaller amounts of cladocera, copepods, mayfly nymphs, and caddisfly larvae. Insects, especially flies, are more important in summer and crustaceans become more important in the winter. The Coosa darter is known to spawn from mid-March to mid-May. The female lays a single egg at a time, placing it in small cracks and crevices in wood, rocks, or other hard substrates. The male fertilizes the eggs as soon as they are laid. They may spawn in any position from horizontal to vertical. Taxonomy The Coosa darter was first formally described as Poecilichthys coosae in 1945 by the American ichthyologist Henry Weed Fowler (1878-1965) with the type locality given as a small creek in the Coosa River drainage within Cherokee County, Alabama, near the settlement of Chesterfield. Status The IUCN has listed this species as being of \\"Least Concern\\" because it has an extensive range in the Coosa River system, has a large total population size, and has numerous subpopulations. In general, the population trend seems stable and no major threats have been identified.

The instrumental version is also popular as a tango. In Spanish, a Violetera is a woman who sells violets. History The song was composed in 1914 by Jos√© Padilla during his stay in Paris as director of the orchestra of the Casino de Paris music hall. The lyricist was Eduardo Montesinos. Its premiere took place in Barcelona with a performance by Carmen Flores. It was singer Raquel Meller who popularized the song in Spain and France first, and worldwide later. Sung in French by Dalida, it was released in 1956 in the first high quality release of the song on vinyl. It was included on her 1956 EP La violetera / Le torrent / Gitane / Fado that reached #10 on 1956 French charts and remained there for 14 weeks. It was included also on her first album Son nom est Dalida in 1957. The 1958 blockbuster musical film The Violet Seller, by Luis C√©sar Amadori, was inspired by the song. The version of \\"La Violetera\\" performed by Sara Montiel in the film, with arrangement by composer Gregorio Garc√≠a Segura and recorded by Hispavox, also became worldwide famous. The film soundtrack was released in different vinyl editions in Spain, Italy, Portugal, France, Greece, Israel, Japan, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Mexico, Canada and the United States. It received a Gold Record award for the number of records sold. The song is also in the repertoire of singers such as Montserrat Caball√©, Gigliola Cinquetti, Nana Mouskouri, Connie Francis and Mieczys≈Çaw Fogg. Other films using \\"La Violetera\\" in its soundtrack include City Lights (1931) by Charles Chaplin with himself and Virginia Cherrill; All Night Long (1981) by Jean-Claude Tramont with Barbra Streisand and Gene Hackman; Scent of a Woman (1992) by Martin Brest with Al Pacino and Chris O'Donnell; In the Mood for Love (2000) by Wong Kar Wai, named \\"Lan Hua Nu\\", recorded in 1949 and sung by Rebecca Pan; and Rajee En Kanmani (1954), named \\"Malligai Poo Jathi Rojaa\\", mixed with \\"La Paloma\\" and sung by Raavu Balasaraswathi. Plagiarism and adaptations City Lights (1931), in which Chaplin used \\"La Violetera\\" In 1926 Anselmo Aieta wrote a tango to lyrics by Francisco Garc√≠a Jim√©nez, where the refrain is a straight borrowing of \\"La Violetera\\"'s theme.'La Violetera' (tango by Aieta) on TODO Tango Among the most famous adaptations is the one by Charles Chaplin in his 1931 film City Lights. The main theme used as a leitmotif for the blind flower-seller is the song \\"La Violetera\\" (\\"Who‚Äôll Buy my Violets\\"). Chaplin was unable to secure the song performer, Raquel Meller, in the lead role, but used the song melody anyway as a major theme. In 1934, Chaplin lost a lawsuit to Padilla (which took place in Paris, where Padilla then lived) for not crediting him. Some modern editions released for video include a new recording by Carl Davis.New recording by Carl Davis Depictions In 1966, a fountain commemorating singer Raquel Meyer, portrayed as a violets seller, was unveiled in Barcelona.

It is found in the upper Tennessee River, one of the over 300 fish species found in Tennessee. Identification This species is similar to the Tippecanoe darter but has scales on cheek behind the eye, 2nd dorsal under the 1st dorsal fin.. The golden darter has a gold margin to the 1st dorsal fin and the body is orange in color marked with vertical dark bars towards the tail. Range The golden darter is extremely localized. It can be found in the Tennessee River drainage, VA, and TN. The species occurs in not more than 10 locations, and habitat quality is subject to ongoing declines. This darter is restricted to the Tennessee River drainage in Tennessee and Virginia. It has been collected from Copper Creek and the Clinch, Sequatchie, Duck, and Buffalo rivers. Habitat and biology The golden darter prefers shallow gravel riffles in small to medium-sized rivers. It is thought to be a species in which the eggs are buried in the substrate. Taxonomy and etymology The golden darter was first formally described in 1997 by Jay Richard Stauffer, Jr. and Ellen S. van Snik Gray with the type locality given as Copper Creek, 180-460 meters upstream from its mouth on Virginia State Route 627, south of Clinchport, Virginia. Previously these fish were considered to be the upper Tennessee River population of the Tippecanoe darter (E. tippiecanoe) but were found to differ in meristics and coloration.

In larger streams, this darter often is associated with emergent vegetation or occurs under tree roots or undercut banks; it also occurs in slower riffles and gravel pools with no cover.Page, Lawrence M. Handbook of darters. Neptune City, New Jersey: TFH Publications, 1983. Life history The life histories of those darter species within the subgenus Catonotus have similar spawning behaviors. They spawn in shallow pools with little or no current and little body contact between the mates. Adult males occupy territories beneath stones where the eggs are attached to the underside of a covering rock. Females invert and deposit eggs on the ceiling and occasionally the guardian male will invert to a head-to-tail position and fertilize the eggs.Mayden, Richard L. \\"Nuptial structures in the subgenus Catonotus, genus Etheostoma (Percidae).\\" Copeia (1985): 580-583. Conservation and management The stone darter is described as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. This means the species does not qualify for any of the other designations because it is widespread and abundant. The justification for this assessment is: despite the somewhat small extent of occurrence, listed as Least Concern in view of the substantial number of subpopulations, apparently large population size, apparently stable trend, and lack of major threats.NatureServe 2013.

It is endemic to the upper Caney Fork system of the Cumberland River drainage in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Appearance and anatomy The largest males have a standard length of and the largest females . Distribution The cherry darter is endemic to the upper Caney Fork system of the Cumberland River drainage, central Tennessee. The species is limited to streams flowing over limestones of the Mississippian Eastern Highland Rim. They do not occur in cool, slightly acidic headwaters or in the lower portion of Caney Fork River system. The range includes White, Putnam, Warren, Van Buren, and Grundy Counties. Ecology Cherry darters feed primarily on aquatic invertebrates and insects, and are known to inhabit a wide range of habitats from springs and small creeks to large rivers. This species has a preference for small- to medium-sized creeks or streams and is usually collected in riffles and runs of moderate to low turbulence, especially over a gravel substrate. In larger streams and rivers, the species is typically found along the margins. Life history Cherry darter spawning peaks in April and early May, and they reach sexual maturity at the age of two. The cherry darter has not been studied extensively, so little else is known of its life history. Status Currently, no management plan is in place for this species. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency evaluated the cherry darter in 2001 and deemed it stable and not a great conservation need for the agency. Although this fish is present only within a restricted range, it is common in some parts of that range and no evidence indicates populations in general are dwindling or it is in immediate danger of extinction. For these reasons, the IUCN lists this species as being of \\"Least Concern\\". The major potential threat is habitat degradation due to chemical runoff from agriculture, siltation, and in some cases effluent from mining. Taxonomy and etymology The cherry darter was first formally described in 1977 by Raymond William Bouchard with the type locality given as Cherry Creek at Tennessee State Route 84, this is a tributary to the Calfkiller River, part of the Caney Fork River system in Tennessee.

The land for the new cemetery was purchased in three lots in 1901: # The central portion of was bought from Alfred Stevens, farmer and landowner of Peckham Rye for ¬£11,305 # The western portion, , next to One Tree Hill was bought later in 1901 also from Alfred Stevens for ¬£19,469 # A final , adjoining the Brockley footpath were bought from the Governors of Christ's Hospital for ¬£6,325 Following its acquisition much of the of land was rented out for other uses, including a golf club and a fireworks factory run by Joseph Wells. Although much of the land was later used for interments there are large portions that remain unused for burials. Some of this land is now a recreation ground and there now is strong local opposition to this land being used for its original purpose of burials. In 1926 the first part of the land was laid out as a cemetery and was consecrated by the Right Reverend William Woodcock Hough, Bishop of Woolwich. The first interment took place on 23 May 1927. A smaller section was set aside for use of Free Churches. The lodge, waiting room and mortuary chapels were designed by Sir Aston Webb and his son, Maurice.Lodge, Camberwell New Cemetery, British Listed Buildings Maurice Webb was the architect for the crematorium, built in 1939 to meet a growing demand for cremations.

It includes restaurants in New York City, Sydney, Toronto, Washington, DC, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles (Noodle Bar, Ss√§m Bar, Ko, M√° P√™che (defunct), Sei≈çbo, Noodle Bar Toronto, K≈çjin, Fuku, Fuku+, CCDC, Nishi, Ando, Las Vegas, Fuku Wall St, KƒÅwi), a bakery established by pastry chef Christina Tosi (Milk Bar), a bar (Nikai), and a quarterly magazine (Lucky Peach). The restaurants are notable for their innovative take on cuisine, while supporting local, sustainable and responsible farmers and food purveyors. Chang has written that the name \\"Momofuku\\" is \\"an indirect nod\\" to Momofuku Ando, the Japanese-Taiwanese inventor of instant ramen. Chang has suggested it is not an accident that he chose a word that sounds similar to the curse word \\"motherfucker\\".  History  With experience in restaurants in New York City, Chef David Chang opened up his first restaurant in 2004, Momofuku Noodle Bar. It was influenced by his time spent working in Japan and visiting ramen shops. After about a year of trials, Noodle Bar took off as a success when the chefs began cooking what they felt like ‚Äî more adventurous dishes with better ingredients. Growing, Noodle Bar eventually moved up the street and Momofuku Ko took over the space. Momofuku Ss√§m Bar opened after Noodle Bar and originally had the concept of an Asian style burrito bar (ssam is Korean for wrap). After experiencing troubles, Chang and his cohorts decided to change the style of the menu, away from the burrito-centered cuisine. This change led Ss√§m Bar to success, as it received two stars (eventually three) from The New York Times. The third restaurant to open was Momofuku Ko. Chang describes the idea behind Ko as a, \\"cook-centric restaurant with just a few stools, a collaborative kitchen, and a constantly changing menu.\\" M√° P√™che was the fourth restaurant to open and the first to open outside of the East Village neighborhood. Momofuku Sei≈çbo in October 2011 was the first restaurant to open outside of the U.S. In January 2012, Momofuku opened the cocktail bar Booker & Dax in the back of Ss√§m Bar in collaboration with Dave Arnold. Momofuku Toronto followed in 2012 alongside the opening of the Shangri-La Hotel. Fuku, a chicken sandwich restaurant, opened in the original Noodle Bar location in June 2015. Doing office work for Ss√§m Bar at the time, pastry chef Christina Tosi began the desserts program at the three Momofuku restaurants, first at Ss√§m Bar, then Noodle Bar, and then Ko. The first Momofuku Milk Bar started in the laundromat next to Ss√§m Bar. After a year and a half, a second Milk Bar opened in Midtown, in the Chambers Hotel. In November 2010 the Williamsburg, Brooklyn kitchen opened to accommodate the growth of Milk Bar. On September 24, 2011, Milk Bar opened its fourth location on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. In March 2012, Milk Bar opened a fifth location in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, and its most recent, sixth, location opened in SOHO in September 2014. In April 2018, Momofuku signed a deal with Kraft Heinz to start selling their chili sauce in American grocery stores.  Restaurants  Momofuku's signature Gua bao dish Momofuku Noodle Bar was the first Momofuku restaurant; it opened in August 2004. It serves ramen, seasonal dishes, and a variety of buns. Since opening in 2006, Momofuku Ss√§m Bar has been listed as one of The World's 50 Best Restaurants for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012. Weekday lunches feature an all-rotisserie duck menu. Booker and Dax (the bar at Ss√§m) is open late serving drinks made with new techniques and technologies. Momofuku Ko opened in March 2008. At Momofuku Ko (ko means \\"child of\\"), guests sit along a kitchen counter and are served by the cooks. Dinner is a set tasting menu devised by the chef, Sean Gray, and his aides-de-cuisine. It is usually about 10 courses long; at lunch the menu stretches out to 16 courses. Since opening in 2008, Momofuku Ko has earned two Michelin stars, which it has retained for eleven years. Ko is No. 70 on the San Pellegrino World's Best Restaurants list. M√° P√™che (\\"mother peach\\") is in Midtown Manhattan in the Chambers Hotel. M√° P√™che opened in 2010 with co-owner and executive chef, Tien Ho, with Chef Paul Carmichael taking the reins in October 2011. This change prompted a shift in M√° P√™che's cuisine from French-Vietnamese to American. M√° P√™che includes a midtown outpost of Christina Tosi's bakery, Momofuku Milk Bar. Fuku is a casual chicken concept by Momofuku. Originally started as a fried chicken sandwich joint, Fuku has since grown to serve a variety of chicken and seasonal offerings, along with beer, slushies, and more. Fuku has locations in the East Village, Wall St, Madison Square Garden, Citi Field, and the Seaport in South Boston. Sei≈çbo is Momofuku's first restaurant outside of New York City. In Sydney, it opened at The Star Casino in late October 2011. \\"Sei≈çbo\\" () is the Japanese pronunciation for the traditional Chinese \\"goddess of the West\\", who is known in mythical stories, such as Journey to the West, as owning the celestial peach orchards. Momofuku Sei≈çbo has two hats from The Sydney Morning Herald Good Food Guide and was named Best New Restaurant. Milk Bar Nolita sign In 2012, David Chang opened Momofuku Toronto, Momofuku's first location in Canada. It is in a three-story glass cube on University Avenue in Downtown Toronto and is home to Noodle Bar, Nikai, Daish≈ç and Sh≈çt≈ç. Noodle Bar is on the ground floor and is a sister-restaurant to the one the same name in New York City. The menu features bowls of ramen and a roster of dishes like steamed buns and rice cakes. The restaurant is home to a custom piece of art created by Steve Keene. Nikai is a bar and lounge on the second floor of Momofuku Toronto. The menu features cocktails, beer, wine, and sake. Guests can order items from both the Noodle Bar and Daish≈ç menus. Daish≈ç is on the third floor. The menu features large format meals meant for parties of 4‚Äì10 guests, as well as an √† la carte menu that includes dishes to share. Sh≈çt≈ç is in the Daish≈ç dining room on the third floor. Sh≈çt≈ç serves a roughly 10-course tasting menu that is based on market availability. Guests are seated along the counter and served by the chefs. Momofuku CCDC opened in October 2015 and is Chang's first restaurant in the Washington, D.C. area and the first in the United States outside of New York. It is in the downtown CityCenterDC development. The restaurant includes a Milkbar location. Crack Pie, a Momofuku Milk Bar original recipe and in its first cookbook Momofuku Milk Bar, under the direction of pastry chef Christina Tosi, is based in New York City and has several locations in the cities of Washington and Toronto. Momofuku Nishi (which means \\"west\\") opened in January 2016 and is Momofuku's first restaurant on the west side. In New York City's Chelsea neighborhood, guests can choose from √† la carte offerings for lunch or dinner. Momofuku Las Vegas is Momofuku's first restaurant in the western U.S. It is inside of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. The menu draws influence from all over the world, including the U.S., Korea, and Japan. The constantly evolving menu features steamed buns, noodles, and meat and seafood meant for sharing. Publications In 2009, David Chang, Peter Meehan, Gabriele Stabile and the Momofuku team produced the Momofuku cookbook. It features recipes and photographs from Momofuku Noodle Bar, Momofuku Ssam Bar, Momofuku Ko, and Milk Bar. The cookbook was a New York Times Best Seller. Written by Christina Tosi with a foreword by David Chang, the Momofuku Milk Bar cookbook was released in October 2011. Christina Tosi included her recipes for Cereal Milk, Crack Pie, the Compost Cookie, and other popular Milk Bar desserts. Scraps is a limited edition collection of outtakes and artwork from the Momofuku cookbook photographer, Gabriele Stabile. From 2011 to November 2013, Lucky Peach,Taking \\"Momofuku\\" as and a quarterly journal of food writing, was published by McSweeney's. Since then, it has been self-published. Lucky Peach was then created by David Chang, Peter Meehan, and Zero Point Zero production. The first issue of Lucky Peach centered on ramen. The second issue, \\"The Sweet Spot\\", included articles on the neurobiology of how the brain detects sweet foods. This issue was a New York Times Best Seller. The third issue, \\"Chefs and Cooks\\", was also a New York Times Best Seller. The fourth issue of Lucky Peach was about American food. The fifth issue was about Chinatown and was released in November 2012. The sixth issue was centered on the theme of the apocalypse and was published in January 2013. The seventh issue of Lucky Peach was about travel. Released in May 2013, the issue featured one of Christopher Boffoli's \\"Big Appetites\\" photographs as its cover image.\\"Photographer Christopher Boffoli Uses Art to Underscore America‚Äôs Obsession With Food\\". Grub Street. June 5, 2013. The eighth issue centered on the idea of gender in the food world.Lucky Peach, issue 8 In March 2017, Lucky Peach announced it would cease publication after printing a double issue in the fall of 2017. Meehan stated that the shuttering of the publication was due to its partners' differences in creative direction and financial strategy.

Club history  The Bristol Bisons RFC (Bisons) were established in 2005, following a visit to the Bingham Cup gay rugby tournament in the summer of 2004 in London. The founders felt that it would be good to spread the messages of an inclusive gay rugby team in the South west. Training for the newly formed club started early in 2005. One of the first matches was the Bisons versus a Barbarians side of players from Manchester and Bristol. By 2009 the club had gone through a quiet spell so it was decided to relaunch the club with new kit and promotional material in December 2009. As part of Bristol Pride 2010 the club promoted itself more visibly particularly on the Bristol gay scene. During season 2010/2011 the team grew in strength and numbers and now has around 30 regular and occasional players. In 2011, the team took part in Bristol Pride and Swindon Pride. In July 2011, the team were chosen as hosts for the Union Cup 2013 European Gay rugby tournament. In 2016, the Bristol Bisons moved to Clifton RFC near the Mall in Cribbs Causeway. In 2017 the Bristol Bisons gained sponsorship from Event Exchange. The Bristol Bisons RFC vs Northampton Outlaws Aviva Game.

It lies about 75 km by road northeast of Juba. The towns of Terekeka and Bor lie downstream, north of Mongalla. During the colonial era, Mongalla was capital of Mongalla Province, which reached south to Uganda and east towards Ethiopia. On 7 December 1917 the last of the northern Sudanese troops were withdrawn from Mongalla, replaced by Equatorial troops. These southern and at least nominally Christian troops remained the only permanent garrison of the town and province until their mutiny in August 1955. Mongalla and the surrounding province was then absorbed into Equatoria Province in 1956. The town was taken and retaken more than once during the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983‚Äì2005). An experimental station was established to grow sugar at Mongalla in the 1950s, and there were plans to establish commercial operations. However, after independence in 1956 the Khartoum government shifted the sugar project to the north, where it is grown under much less favorable conditions with heavy irrigation. A sugar, clothing, and a weaving factory was established in Mongalla in the 1970s but operations failed to get beyond their trial phase and diminished as conflict grew in the region in the early 1980s. In April 2006 the President of Southern Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, named Mongalla as one of the Nile ports to be the first to be rehabilitated. Mongalla is an important center for gauging the flow of the Nile, with measurements taken regularly from 1905 until 1983, and since 2004. History and politics Early colonial period Theodore Roosevelt on Safari After the final defeat of the Caliphate (Khalifa) by the British under General Herbert Kitchener in 1898, the Nile up to the Uganda border became part of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. An expedition upriver from Omdurman (Ondurman) arrived in December 1900. The post that had been established at Kiro was transferred to Mongalla in April 1901 since Kiro was claimed to be in Belgian territory. During 1904 posts were established where needed in the Mongalla districts to suppress the activities of \\"Abyssinian brigands who infested the country\\". Until 1906 Mongalla province was part of the Upper Nile province, after which it became a separate administration. The first governor was Angus Cameron, appointed in January 1906. A party from the Anglican Church Missionary Society (CMS) arrived the same month, but decided it was not suitable for a base and instead located the mission downstream at Bor. The colonial administration opposed efforts by the CMS to convert the Bari people of Mongalla. The missionaries interpreted this as due to the influence of Islam in weakening the spiritual ideals of the officials. Cameron desired to avoid friction with the Muslims who had undertaken most of the work of building and servicing the new provincial capital. In 1910 Theodore Roosevelt visited the province. Before his arrival, Governor R.C.R. Owen informed Governor General Sir Reginald Wingate that everything would be done for the former president of the United States, but also pointed out that his troops had not even one donkey. Roosevelt's expedition reached Mongalla at the end of February, coming from the Belgian Congo via the Lado Enclave. He was impressed by the Egyptian and Sudanese troops, but when visiting a native dance he commented on the lack of middle-aged men, a result of the Mahdist wars that had ended over ten years ago. In June 1910 the British Sudanese forces took over the Lado Enclave from the Belgians, becoming part of the province of Mongalla. The Anglican and Roman Catholic missionaries requested that Sunday be retained as a sabbath at Lado, as it had been under the Belgians, rather than changed to Friday as it had in the rest of the Sudan. However, Governor Owen opposed retaining Sunday; he felt that the more \\"bigoted\\" Muslims in the army would object to working on Friday, and noted that all recruits to the army were instructed in the Muslim religion. General Sir Francis Reginald Wingate, Governor-General of Sudan A few months later, however, Owen proposed creation of an Equatorial battalion composed entirely of southerners. This force would be taught to follow English commands and the Christian faith, which would, over time, unite with Uganda and would prevent spread of the Muslim faith farther south. He was against Islam on the basis that it \\"may at any time break out into a wave of fanaticism\\". Owen's plan was approved by Wingate. Wingate said \\"...we must remember that the bulk of the inhabitants ... are not Moslems (Muslims) at all, that the whole of Uganda has accepted Chritianity almost without a murmur, and that furthermore English is a very much easier language to learn than Arabic...\\". In 1913, the government increased restrictions on private travel and immigrants, which meant anybody arriving in Mongalla and wishing to go north from the Uganda or the Belgian Congo could be examined for sleeping sickness by a medical officer. The maximum punishment for any breach of the new regulations was a ¬£10 fine or a 6-month prison sentence. On 7 December 1917 the last of the northern Sudanese troops were withdrawn from Mongalla, replaced by Equatorial troops. These southern and at least nominally Christian troops remained the only permanent garrison of the town and province until their mutiny in August 1955. When Hasan Sharif, son of Khalifa Muhammad Sahif, was exiled to Mongalla in 1915 after taking place in a conspiracy in Omdurman, Governor Owen said \\"...I told him he is lucky to come and see this part of Sudan for nothing, when tourists pay hundreds of pounds ... I fear he doesn't see the joke...\\". Owen retired in 1918. Major Cecil Stephen Northcote succeeded him as Governor of Mongala from 1918 to 1919, then moved on to become Governor of the Nuba Mountains province. The Sudan was very lightly administered. As late as 1919 there were just 17 British administrators in the Bahr al-Ghazal and Mongalla provinces, with a combined area twice that of Britain. In the early years, British officials depended on native officials for advice and to act as interpreters. However, they had to be careful about ethnic rivalries. Thus Fadl el-Mula, a Dinka who had been a police quartermaster, greatly impressed the Governor of Mongalla and was appointed assistant superintendent of the Twic Dinka in 1909. He was credited with keeping the peace between the Dinka and the Nuer people, two groups with a history of fighting and cattle raiding. However, Fadl el-Mula was so strongly biased towards the Dinka that his police were attacked by angry Nuer and he had to be removed from his post. The Arabic language and the Muslim religion continued to be spread in South Sudan by merchants and administrators from the North, and even by British officials who preferred to speak Arabic rather than learn the local language. A rising by the Aliab Dinka in 1919 was suppressed harshly in 1920. That year the Nuer were attacking both the Dinka and the Burun people on the border with Ethiopia. The governor of Mongalla in 1920, V.R. Woodland, said that Mongalla at the time was \\"in such a muck-up state he doesn't know where to start\\". Woodland called for a decision; either South Sudan should be separated from the north and administered as a territory in the same way as Uganda, or the British should encourage development by the Arabs within the structure of the North Sudan. Nothing was done. Later colonial period (1920‚Äì1956) The Mongalla region suffered an outbreak of cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) between 1918 and 1924, apparently introduced by Ugandan porters who had served in German East Africa during World War I. CSM caused high mortality for a six-year period as it spread from one family to another. A less devastating CSM epidemic started in 1926, causing 335 deaths in 1928, 446 in 1929 and 335 in the first three months of 1930 before rapidly dying out. Dr. Alexander Cruikshank of the Sudan Medical Services attributed the epidemic in part to poor housing conditions. The Azande people of the western part of the province avoided the disease. They had a better diet and less crowded quarters than the Dinka and Nuer people in the centre of the province. Airplanes began being used in the Sudan in the 1920s, with revolutionary effect on military and civilian administration. Flying was hazardous, however. On 4 July 1929 a Fokker FViib/3m owned by the Belgian financier Albert Lowenstein crashed at Mongalla. There were no deaths, but the plane was severely damaged. A Singapore flying boat built by Short Brothers made a flight around Africa in 1929. Starting from Benghazi, the plane flew to Aboukir Bay, then up the Nile to Mongalla, which was reached at the end of January, and onward to Entebbe on Lake Victoria. During the 1920s the British steadily expanded control over the South Sudan. The Deputy governor of Mongalla, Major R.G.C. Brock, estimated that he had added 50,000 Toposa and related people to the eastern half of his province, a somewhat inflated figure. By establishing strong central control, the British eroded whatever authority the traditional rulers may have had. In 1929 the British governor of Mongalla province said \\"the government support which can be given to the chiefs is not worth their while to have\\". In 1925 Major G.D. Gould was denied a license to prospect for gold and oil in the east of Mongalla province beyond the Didinga Hills. Travel in the Toposa country was dangerous without a large armed escort, and if the Ethiopians had got word of the survey they would have tried to occupy that part of the country. The British began to follow an \\"Africanization\\" policy. A directive issued on 25 January 1930 by the Civil Secretary of Sudan to the governors of Upper Nile, Bahr al-Ghazal and Mongalla said: \\"The policy of the government in the southern Sudan is to build up series of self-contained racial or tribal units with structures and organization based to whatever extent the requirement of equity and good government permits, upon indigenous customs, traditional usage and beliefs\\". In 1930 the capital of Equatoria (southern Sudan) was transferred from Mongalla to Juba, further upstream to the south. The governor of Mongalla province from 1930 until 1936 was Leonard Fielding Nalder, formerly governor of Fung province from 1927 to 1930. In 1935 Nalder reported after a survey of his province that there was a general lack of tribal cohesion. Governor- General Sir Stewart Symes at Khartoum had little interest in development of the south of Sudan and he advised the local officials that chiefs should have territorial rather than ethnic authority. In 1936 Mongalla and the Bahr al- Ghazal provinces were incorporated into the Equatoria province, with headquarters at Juba, with parts of Upper Nile province detached. Civil war Salva Kiir, the President of South Sudan Sudan became independent in 1956, after the outbreak of the First Sudanese Civil War (1955‚Äì1972). After the Addis Ababa Agreement (1972) the Jieng Bor and Murle people lived in relative peace, sharing grazing areas, especially Gok Bor. In mid 1981 this harmony broke down when Murle bandits attacked Jieng Bor cattle camps in several locations around Mongalla. The police were called in by the commissioner of Mongalla, and turned against the Bor Dinka. The SPLM/A exploited this hostility to the Bor Dinka by some Equatorian tribes to gain recruits from the Dinka. Peace broke down and the civil war resumed in 1983. Early in 1985 the Southern Axis of the SPLA under Major Arok Thon Arok challenged government forces in Southern Upper Nile, Eastern Equatoria and Central Equatoria. The Southern Axis captured Owiny-ki-Bul and Mongalla without difficulty, then crossed the Nile, captured Terekeka and besieged Juba. Later in 1985 the forces of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) received a setback at the village of Gut-Makur near Mongalla when they were confronted by well-armed Mandari people. Although willing to fight the Sudan army, the Mandari were not willing to do so under Dinka leadership. In March 1989 Alternate Commander Jok Reng of the SPLA Mainstream recaptured Mongalla with a relatively small force. In the last half of 1989 the SPLA consolidated in towns like Mongalla that surrounded Juba. In late 1991, Mongalla was the scene of clashes between two arms of the SPLA. Riek Machar of the SPLM/A Nasir was pushing south towards Torit, while the SPLM/A Mainstream commander for Equatoria Kuol Manyang Juuk wanted to push Riek's forces back to Nuerland. Due to disunity among the southerners, between 1991 and 1994 the NIR was able to recapture many places in South Sudan including Mongalla and also Ayod, Leer, Akobo, Pochalla, Pibor, Waat, Nasir, Kit, Palotaka, Yirol, Bor, Torit, Kapoeta, Parjok and Magwi. Government forces coming from Bor took Mongalla in June 1992 and then turned east toward Torit. Post-civil war The Second Sudanese Civil War finally ended in January 2005. However, Mongalla continued to suffer at the hands of the Lord's Resistance Army. Due to the civil war, Mongalla had suffered considerable physical neglect and damage, and population loss. In April 2006 the President of Southern Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, named Mongalla as one of the Nile ports to be the first to be rehabilitated. He warned that demands for reconstruction spending would be much greater than available funding, so work had to be prioritized. Clearance of the Mongalla minefield was complete in July 2009. Mongalla is an important center for gauging the flow of the Nile, with measurements taken regularly from 1905 until 1983. During most of the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983‚Äì2005) the gauging stopped, resuming in 2004. Geography and climate Mongalla lies about by road northeast of Juba on the road to Bor in the north, but nearer as the crow flies. Mongalla is situated on the east bank of the White Nile in Central Equatoria state at an altitude of . Rainfall is relatively low between November and February, then increasing with two peaks in June and August. Annual precipitation is about . Winds are northerly in the dry season and southerly in the rainy season. Based on observations taken between April 1903 and December 1905, the mean temperature was , with mean maximum and mean minimum . Mean relative humidity was 74%. The river flowing past Mongalla combines seasonal torrential runoff in the rainy season with the more constant discharge from Lake Victoria, influenced by evaporation and by the damping and storage effects of Lake Albert, Lake Edward and Lake Kyoga. The Sudd, a vast area of swampland, stretches downriver from Mongalla to near the point where the Sobat River joins the White Nile just upstream from Malakal. Due to evaporation, only half the water that enters the Sudd at Mongalla emerges from the northern end of the swamps. The much smaller Badigeru Swamp lies about to the east, separated from Mongalla by a region of open grassland. The belt along the Nile about 10 km wide and 146 km long from Mongalla to Bor is inhabited by the Mundari and Dinka peoples. Economic development Fishing in the Sudd wetland The district commissioners initiated the development of cotton at Mongalla in the 1920s and 1930s, but the price paid for Mongalla cotton fell from 50 piastres per kantar in 1929‚Äì30 to 18 piastres in 1931 and the industry failed to develop as planned.The \\"Southern Scales\\", which defined the rates of pay for officials and workers in the southern provinces of Sudan, were extremely low, making it impossible for the administrators to undertake any development such as a school, hospital or economic projects. Use of money was restricted, and even in 1945 taxes were still being paid in kind. In 1937 J.C. Myers was commissioned to undertake a botanical survey of Mongalla province, later extended to all of Equatoria. In contrast to the pessimistic view of the south taken by the Khartoum administration, he was enthusiastic about the wealth and diversity of plants. He noted that the people had adapted to cultivating non-native plants such as cassava, maize, sweet potato and groundnuts. He also noted that the government was restricting commercial development of sugarcane, tobacco and coffee, which grew wild, and thus preventing economic development. In 1938 Governor Symes made a tour of Equatoria and left with \\"contempt intensified\\". He consistently rejected schemes for development. An experimental station was established to grow sugar at Mongalla in the 1950s, and there were plans to establish commercial operations. However, after independence in 1956 the Khartoum government shifted the sugar project to the north, where it is grown under much less favorable conditions with heavy irrigation. After the First Sudanese Civil War ended in 1972, there were plans to revive sugar production at Mongalla, and although Mongalla Sugar Processing Factory operated on a low-scale in the 1970s, it ceased production when civil war broke out again in 1983.A clothing mill also operated in the 1970s but was deactivated due to the unrest in the early 1980s. A paper mill was also planned at Mongalla, to be fed by eucalyptus species planted in a 70,000 feddan area.Equipment was supplied from Denmark between 1975 and 1976 for use in an agro-industrial complex at Mongalla. This would include a power station and pump station to support an abattoir, poultry project, fish-receiving plant and wood-working factory. The equipment arrived but was not installed, and eventually rusted away. A project funded by Khartoum also established six textile-manufacturing units in Sudan, one at Mongalla, and the other five factories located in the north at Ed Duiem, Kadugli, Kosti, Nyala, and Shendi. An agreement was made with a Belgian firm, SOBERI, to supply the weaving factory of 256 looms and at one point it was estimated to produce around 9 million meters of grey fabric per annum, but it failed to get past the trial phase due to lack of raw materials, capital, and transportation facilities.

Provisions The 1875 Act was the culmination of a series of acts that expanded the authority of the federal judiciary after the American Civil War. Headed \\"An Act to determine the jurisdiction of circuit courts of the United States, and to regulate the removal of causes from State courts, and for other purposes\\",18 Stat. 470. March 3, 1875. it granted the U.S. circuit courts the jurisdiction to hear all cases arising under the United States Constitution and the laws of the United States, as long as the matter in dispute was worth more than $500. The statute also made it possible for plaintiffs and defendants in cases before state courts to remove a case to a U.S. circuit court whenever the matter involved a question of federal law or if any members of the parties were from different states. By establishing the full federal jurisdiction permitted by the Constitution, the act of 1875 fundamentally changed the role of the federal courts through the most sweeping extension of judicial power since the short- lived Judiciary Act of 1801. Background Since 1789, federal jurisdiction had been divided between the federal courts and state courts, with the latter hearing most cases involving federal law if both parties were residents of the state. In the first half of the nineteenth century, Congress occasionally expanded the right of removal to federal courts in order to protect specific areas of federal authority such as enforcement of customs regulations during the War of 1812 and the collection of revenue following South Carolina‚Äôs attempt to nullify tariff laws. During and after the Civil War, Congress more frequently included removal provisions in acts designed to protect civil and political liberties in the former Confederate states, but the right of removal continued to be extended only in attempts to enforce specific policies. By 1875, the members of Congress who supported full federal jurisdiction and a broad right of removal from the state courts were concerned less with the protection of freed slaves and white Unionists in the South than with the advancement of business interests that were often obstructed by state courts. Enactment After the Supreme Court of the United States in 1874 overturned the removal provisions in two recent acts, Representative Luke Poland of Vermont introduced legislation to restore the right of removal in all civil cases in which one of the defendants was a citizen of a state other than that in which the suit was filed. Although the House rejected this modest extension of removal and passed a bill to make only minor revisions in the law, Senator Matthew Carpenter of Wisconsin proposed amendments to grant full federal jurisdiction to the United States circuit courts and guarantee the right of removal in any civil case arising under federal law or in which there was diversity of citizenship, with the $500 threshold applying to both categories of cases. The debate in Congress focused on the growing significance of interstate commerce and the economic benefits of a uniform system of justice. The United States House of Representatives accepted that version of the bill, which President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law in March 1875. Consequences Although this broad redefinition of federal jurisdiction prompted surprisingly little comment at the time, the act of 1875 attracted new types of litigation that swelled the caseload of the federal courts and challenged the existing organization of the judiciary.

History Early Years First Reformed Church (FRC) was organized on May 6, 1871 in order to serve the Dutch Settlers who began arriving in Orange City in 1870. As a result of population growth and the rising cost of land, a large group of Hollanders moved 300 miles northwest from Pella, IA. As people of deep and abiding religious faith, the establishment of a Christian church was one of the community's first priorities. Initial services were led by literate lay people (mostly farmers), who would read the Bible, pray, sing Psalms, and possibly read from a book of sermons. However as the community of Dutch settlers continued to grow, the need for an ordained minister became readily apparent ‚Äì there was no one available to perform baptisms or administer the Eucharist. After the church was officially organized, it extended a call to the Reverend Seine Bolks of Zeeland, Michigan, who became the church's first minister in April 1872. The first few years were exceedingly hard for the new settlers. \\"Prairie fires, hordes of grasshoppers which stripped the fields bare, hail-storms, droughts and severe blizzards were commonplace during the first decade of the church‚Äôs existence\\". The Church was even forced to close for a few weeks in 1882 as a result of a smallpox epidemic. However, the people persevered, in part because of the constant reassurance of Dominee Bolks. Through immigration, birth, and mission, the church continued to grow steadily into the 20th century. Dominee Bolks - 1872‚Äì1878 Reverend Seine Bolks is still known among the people as Dominee Bolks - a title of respect and the Dutch equivalent of 'Reverend Bolks'. When a call was first extended to him in the fall of 1871, he declined, but later accepted after the call was extended to him a second time. He arrived in Orange City and began his pastorate in April 1872. As a young man, Bolks had shown promise and was hand- picked and trained by Rev. Albertus van Raalte (Dutch immigrant and founder of Holland, MI). Bolks followed Van Raalte to Michigan in 1848 where he became the first pastor of the Overisel Reformed Church. He served churches in Wisconsin and Illinois before coming to northwest Iowa. He preached twice each Sunday in Orange City and as the community grew and spread, he would journey three to four times a week to an outlying schoolhouse to preach to those who lived far from the church. Later, when churches organized in Sioux Center and Alton, he preached to these congregations until they received their own ministers. In addition to being a minister, Bolks was often called upon to care for the sick and injured. In the absence of a medical doctor, Bolks used his limited medical training to perform amputations and to assist midwives. Once a trained doctor arrived at the colony, Bolks refused to make any more calls. Due to failing health, Bolks handed over his responsibilities to Rev. Buursma, though he remained active in the community until his death on June 16, 1894. Rev. Ale Buursma - 1879‚Äì1889 Rev. Ale Burrsma was a Frisian- born Civil War veteran and a member of the first graduating classes of Hope College and Western Theological Seminary. He was called three times before he decided to leave his church in South Holland, IL to come to Orange City. He was the first pastor at FRC to be able to preach in English, though he rarely did so. The growing 'American' population led to the formation of the English- language American Reformed Church in 1885. Buursma cared deeply about Christian education and was given a three-month leave of absence in 1883 to fill a vacancy at the new Northwestern Classical Academy. Buursma also acted as principal for a year at the school. He served for a decade at FRC and left in 1889 to be the pastor of Fifth Reformed Church in Grand Rapids, MI. Rev. Harm Vander Ploeg - 1890‚Äì1893 After Rev. Buursma left, FRC was without a minister for over a year, eventually calling Harmen Vander Ploeg. His pastorate was shortened by ill health, but he was valued for his strong morals and theology as well as his concern for missions. He served the church until his death in 1893, little more than two-and-a-half years after beginning at FRC. Rev. Matthew Kolyn - 1893‚Äì1898 Rev. Matthew Kolyn was the first American born pastor at First Reformed. A Wisconsin native, he graduated from New Brunswick Theological Seminary in New Jersey. His pastorate showed the beginnings of the Americanization movement within the church as First Reformed established a branch of Christian Endeavor - an evangelical, interdenominational youth organization that exposed the youth, in English, to non-Reformed theology and hymnody. At the same time, the consistory insisted that Sunday school continue to use Dutch material. Kolyn periodically suffered from ill health and after his five years in Orange City, he became a professor at Western Theological Seminary. Rev. N. M. Steffens - 1898‚Äì1901 Reverend Nicholas Martinus Steffens was born in Germany, educated in the Netherlands, and was a missionary to the Jewish population in Istanbul. He served congregations on the Dutch-German border and in the United States, taught at Western Theological Seminary and Dubuque Theological Seminary and was a friend and ally of the theologian-politician Abraham Kuyper. It was surprising to many that a man of his stature accepted the call to a church in a developing and isolated area, but he may have been influenced by the fact that his daughter taught at the Northwestern Classical Academy. His pastorate was short lived and after two years he accepted the call again to teach at Dubuque Seminary. Rev. E. W. Stapelkamp - 1901‚Äì1907 Like Kolyn, the Rev. Evert Stapelkamp was born in Wisconsin and graduated from Hope College and New Brunswick Seminary. During his time at First Reformed Church, the renting of pews was abolished. He also introduced electric lighting to the sanctuary and added concrete sidewalks. The church choir, an American innovation, was introduced and singers were instructed to sing beside the organ. He too had health problems that led him to resign. Rev. John Engelsman - 1908‚Äì1925 Rev. Engelsman had the longest pastorate at First Reformed Church up to that time. He preferred to preach in Dutch, but was able to preach in strongly accented English. This caused considerable tension during the World War I (his lawn was set on fire for being too 'Dutch'), when state policy called for English-only services (the Sioux County Board of Defense allowed the service to be repeated in Dutch after an English service). Rev. Engelsman took a group to Palestine in 1914, after which he presented lectures on his trip throughout the town. Rev. Dr. Henry Colenbrander - 1925‚Äì1960 Colenbrander was the pastor of First Reformed Church for thirty-five years through a myriad of transitions - in particular the transition from worshipping in Dutch to worshipping in English. He served as the president of the Board of Trustees at Northwestern Classical Academy for thirty-four years and oversaw its expansion to a junior college in 1928 and, just before his death, to a four year college. A men's residence hall on campus is named in his honor. Rev. Raymond Van Heukelom - 1961‚Äì1979 Under Rev. Van Heukelom, FRC recognized the need to expand its ministry and began to increase its staff and services. An associate pastor was hired to help with education in the newly expanded education wing. A second morning service was introduced to deal with the growing congregation. However, two services led to a feeling of there being 'two congregations', a problem which was solved by the tearing down of the old sanctuary and building the current sanctuary in 1979 so that the entire congregation could worship together. The church's ministry continued to expand as retired RCA pastors began to assist part-time in FRC's ministry. Rev. Cecil Martens - 1981‚Äì1988 As the culture shifted entering the 1980s, Rev. Cecil Martens was asked to provide faithful leadership and to lend an outward focus to the church's ministry. The realization that one could no longer say that 'everyone went to church' helped shift the mission emphasis of the church from purely international missions to include local efforts as well. Rev. Martens also took great strides in reaching out to the college community and making FRC a place that the local students would want to attend. Rev. Steve Vander Molen - 1989‚Äì2005 Rev. Vander Molen served the church for 15 years before taking calls at Christ Memorial Church in Holland, MI. In 1996, he contributed to church's most recent history book at its 125th Anniversary. In 2000, he oversaw the expansion of the office space in order to better accommodate the growing staff. Author Kevin DeYoung served as associate pastor under pastor Vander Molen. Rev. Perry De Groot, Rev. Edward Suffern, Rev. James Daniels - 2005‚Äì2010 At this time, the church moved to a tri-part staff structure. Rev. Perry De Groot was the Shepherding Pastor (2006‚Äì2010). Rev. Edward Suffern was the Preaching/Teaching Pastor (2007‚Äì2009). Rev. James Daniels was the Equipping Pastor (2005‚Äì2008). Rev. Timothy Breen - 2010‚Äìpresent In August 2010, First Reformed Church extended a call to Rev. Timothy Breen. Rev. Breen continues to serve as the Lead Pastor and lives in Orange City with his wife and two children. In May 2011, the consistory called Rev. Mark Haverdink - a native son of FRC - to be the Pastor of Congregational Life. Beliefs First Reformed Church is an Evangelical and Reformed congregation that is active within the Reformed Church in America. Mission Daughter Churches Throughout its long history, First Reformed Church has birthed numerous daughter churches in northwest Iowa, including *First Reformed Church - Sioux Center, IA (1877) *First Reformed Church - Alton, IA (1877) *Reformed Church of Newkirk - Newkirk, IA (1882) *First Reformed Church - Maurice, IA (1884) *American Reformed Church - Orange City, IA (1885) *Reformed Church of Middleburg - Middleburg, IA (1885) *Trinity Reformed Church - Orange City, IA (1919) Northwestern College In 1882, First Reformed Church established Northwestern Classical Academy (now Northwestern College) in Orange City to serve as a place to educate the young people in the community. There has been consistent support and leadership from the Church to the college community. Local and international missions Throughout its history, First Reformed Church has consistently supported missionaries both locally and across the world. As of 2011, over 90 sons and daughters of the congregation had become ministers or missionaries.

Noffke is noted for his technical versatility, his pioneering research into hot forging, the introduction of new alloys, and his ability to both build on and challenge traditional techniques. He has been called the metalsmith's metalsmith, a pacesetter, and a maverick.Mitchell, LeeAnn, Studio Visit with Garry Noffke, Metalsmith Magazine, Winter 2004 He is also an educator who has mentored an entire generation of metalsmiths. He has received numerous awards and honors.

Today he is retired from formal teaching and lives and works at his studio in Farmington, Georgia. Early life Gary Lee Noffke was born in Decatur, Illinois and grew up in the small town of Sullivan, Illinois. His father worked in a shoe factory. His German grandfather had a small farm and was still using a mule to plow his fields. His family being poor, Noffke made his own toys out of whatever materials were at hand, scavenged from the farm, the factory, and construction sites. With just a hand saw and a pocket knife, he created birdhouses, slingshots, hinged boxes, and bows and arrows.Falino, p. 14. To this day he makes his own tools.Maschal, Richard, Forge follows function, Carolina Living, March 27, 2011 At the age of 12, encouraged by his mother and a neighbor who was a landscape painter, he began drawing and painting in oils. His mother was later able to help pay for his education by working at, and then becoming the owner of, a shelter care home business. Education Noffke enrolled at Eastern Illinois University, getting his BS in 1965 and his MS in Education 1966. In 1967 he went to the University of Iowa intending to study painting, but soon found himself attracted to metalsmithing. He had already been exposed to metal in a course he took from Garret de Ruiter while at Eastern Illinois University. For a while at Iowa he studied metalwork under Raoul Delmar but soon abandoned that school and moved on to Southern Illinois University at Carbondale where he studied with Brent Kington who was leading a revival of blacksmithing which lasted well into the 1970s. At Carbondale he met other up and coming metal artists such as Mary Lee Hu. He learned to forge steelFalino, p. 15. and was particularly impressed by a simple knife made by his mentor, Kington.Dunas, p. 34-35. Noffke got his Master of Fine Arts at SIU in 1969. Career While he still was studying painting, Noffke had been influenced by the abstract expressionism of Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock. Just as these painters had attacked the canvas with swirls, drips, splashes, and smears, Noffke would attack the surface of his metal objects with obsessive and intricate detail consisting of stars, letterforms, arrows, crosses, dollar signs, eyes, and other obscure symbols.Falino, p. 16. These richly detailed surfaces, stamped, engraved, and carved into the metal illustrate a paradox evident in all of the artist's work. On one hand, each object presents a surface of inscrutable markings. On the other hand, each object is in the end just an ordinary bowl, spoon, knife, or some other purely utilitarian object.Dunas, p. 34. Noffke first taught at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida, and then at California State College at Los Angeles. In 1971, he took a position at the University of Georgia at Athens where he was to remain for the next thirty years. Noffke was awarded a faculty research grant in the early 1970s from the University of Georgia to explore the cold forging of fine silver from sheet. Expert opinion said that the hot forging of fine silver was impossible; but Noffke discovered an alloy that made it easy. He discovered that by eliminating some of the copper content in sterling silver he was able to cast his own billets of 969 silver. Still later he developed a method to forge gold from cast billets. In the years 1977 to 1979 Noffke, working with the University of Georgia and several other artists, put together three annual \\"National Ring Shows\\" featuring the younger generation of metalsmiths.Falino, p. 18. The shows did not rely on museums but were escorted around the country by the participants themselves. The idea was so successful, that The Lamar Dodd School of Art and the Georgia Museum of Art repeated the format again in 2011.Lamar Dodd School of Art, The Ring Shows: Then & Now and Putting the Band Back Together For thirty years Noffke taught at the University of Georgia and then retired from active teaching. He built his own studio‚Äîand all the tools in that studio‚Äîin the hills near Farmington, Georgia. Some of those tools along with his refrigerator from the studio were featured in his solo exhibition at Charlotte's Mint Museum in the fall of 2011. Richly and elaborately decorated, it is a perfect example of the artist's usual blending of surrealistic decoration and practical utility.

The 166th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 25, 2011. The episode follows the Griffin family after they win the state lottery, and go on to spend the money with no regard. Peter becomes power hungry, and demands that Quagmire and Joe perform tasks for him when he invests in one of their projects. This ultimately causes the group to end their friendship, to the dismay of Peter's wife, Lois, who tells her husband that the money has changed him for the worse. After continually wasting the money on various expenditures, the family discovers that they have gone broke, and return to their lives as a lower middle class family. Peter also apologizes to Quagmire and Joe, repairing his broken friendships. The episode was written by Andrew Goldberg and directed by Greg Colton. \\"Lottery Fever\\" received mixed reviews from television critics for its storyline and cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 7.69 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Randy Crenshaw, Judy Greer, Christine Lakin, Chris O'Dowd, Tara Strong and Fred Tatasciore, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. Plot The Griffin family must begin living on a stricter budget. A local news story on the lottery influences Peter to buy a ticket in hopes that he will win and set the family on a better financial platform. Peter reveals to his family that he has bought several thousand lottery tickets, admitting that he has taken out a second mortgage on the house in order to buy them. After watching the results of the lottery that night, they spend three days searching for the lottery tickets, only to discover that the lottery tickets were, in fact, printed by Peter. When the real batch arrives, they discover that they have indeed won it. The family are unable to decide how they should spend all the money, though Lois states that she does not want it to change their lifestyle. Defiant, Peter decides to begin living lavishly, and quits his job. After Peter agrees to invest in Quagmire's projects and gives money to Joe for Bonnie's birthday, Peter demands that they hang out with him in order to pay him back, and perform random, often painful or humiliating tasks. Joe brings the first season of True Blood to show Peter boob. He shouts at joe for not knowing that \\"Anna Paquin boob doesn't count as real boob\\", then shouts at Anna for being on a terrible show. Peter tells Quagmire to take a huge bite out of a Popsicle, which leaves him in agony. Quagmire and Joe finally get fed up with Peter's demands and both decide to end their friendship with Peter when he makes them both perform a musical duet on \\"making whoopie\\" for his entertainment and shoots them with a BB gun, causing Joe to get shot in the eye and Quagmire getting shot in the throat. Peter continues to spend the money with no regard, and Lois warns him that he is changing for the worse, along with the other family members. Peter tells her that they no longer have to worry about expenses, and presents her with a blood diamond, winning her over. When they go to a restaurant, Peter discovers his credit card got declined, and his money disappeared. After buying more lottery tickets, winning again, and then blowing it again, the family is distraught over losing their fortune, and Peter returns to the local bar later that day to repair his friendship with Joe and Quagmire. He admits that the money caused him to forget who his real friends are; Quagmire and Joe accept his apology, and offer him money from the investment that he had given them. The family then goes back to living comfortably at their home in Quahog, despite being depressed over having everything and then losing it. Production and development Judy Greer guest starred in the episode The episode was first announced on July 27, 2011, during a \\"sweepstakes\\" hosted by 20th Century Fox. The sweepstakes reportedly would provide the winner with $3,000, as well as the announcement of the winner's name during the episode's premiere in the United States. It was directed by series regular Greg Colton, who had previously directed several of the Road to... episodes, including the Emmy Award winning episodes \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" and \\"Road to the North Pole\\". The episode was written by series regular Andrew Goldberg, who joined the show in its sixth season. Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors, with Andrew Goldberg, Alex Carter, Spencer Porter, Anthony Blasucci, Mike Desilets and Deepak Sethi serving as staff writers for the episode. Composer Walter Murphy, who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for \\"Lottery Fever\\". The episode first premiered at an advance screening in Chicago, Illinois at the Kerasotes Theatre. In addition to the regular cast, voice actor Randy Crenshaw, actress Judy Greer, actress Christine Lakin, comedian Chris O'Dowd, voice actress Tara Strong and voice actor Fred Tatasciore guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Alexandra Breckenridge, voice actor John G. Brennan, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, and writer John Viener made minor appearances. Recurring guest voice actor Adam West made another appearance in this episode. Cultural references At the beginning of the episode, Peter, Brian and Chris are watching Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan as edited for goats on TV; the live action scene involving Khan saying he's marooned for all eternity is shown, in which Kirk yells \\"Khan\\" as \\"BAA!\\". Peter forces Joe to watch True Blood. Peter jumping in a room full of gold coins is a reference to the animated series Duck Tales. The bar scene in which the waiter Peter likes starts to sing, is a reference to the \\"Trolololol\\" internet meme featuring Eduard Khil. Jenner reference The beginning of the episode shows a cutaway gag of Peter performing on a USO Tour (presumably using Bob Hope's comedy routine as his own) to the United States Navy before introducing Caitlyn Jenner (then Bruce), who performs burlesque to the tune of The Stripper. While the reference at the time was to the fact that Jenner's then-wife Kris Jenner \\"wore the pants\\" in their marriage, in a bit of life imitating art, the clip would resurface in 2015 when reports surfaced that Jenner was transitioning to a trans woman following her divorce from Kris.BRUCE JENNER‚ÄôS TRANSFORMATION: ‚ÄòFAMILY GUY‚Äô CALLED IT FIRST ‚Äî WATCH!

It was followed by MacFarlane's other series American Dad!. It was watched by 7.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, despite airing simultaneously with Desperate Housewives on ABC, The Good Wife on CBS and Sunday Night Football on NBC. The episode also acquired a 4.1/9 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, beating all three shows, in addition to significantly edging out The Cleveland Show and American Dad! in total viewership. The episode's ratings decreased significantly from the previous season's premiere episode, \\"And Then There Were Fewer\\". The episode received mixed reviews. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club graded the episode a C, stating \\"I would have less of a problem with the typically shallow excuse for a plot if there was more funny material, but even by Family Guy standards, there wasn‚Äôt a whole lot in this episode\\". Kate Moon of TV Fanatic gave a 3/5 rating. She disliked the parts where Peter \\"[was] acting like a douche to his friends\\", calling them \\"[not] interesting enough to watch for 23 minutes\\". She also stated the episode would have \\"vastly improved\\" if the plot was on Brian and Stewie. The episode debuted in the United Kingdom (and was followed by \\"Seahorse Seashell Party\\") on 20 May 2012, with 1.55 million viewers. It was the sixth most watched episode on a single night on the BBC Three channel.

Born in 1908 in Burnley, Lancashire, Lord was the son of a barber.Inglis, League Football and the Men Who Made It, p. 268. As a boy he worked for a local butcher, until at the age of 19 he started his own business.Hopcraft, p. 147. Lord's butchery business eventually grew into 14 shops. Lord was an avid follower of his local football club, Burnley, and in 1950 attempted to join the board. This approach was blocked, but another position became available a year later. Lord was the sole candidate, and thus became a board member. He became chairman in 1955. The early years of Lord's chairmanship were the most successful in the club's history. Following the appointment of Harry Potts as manager in 1958, Burnley were league champions in 1960, and reached the FA Cup Final in 1962. The club became renowned for their youth policy, which yielded players such as Jimmy McIlroy, Willie Morgan and Martin Dobson, and investment in a new training ground gave Burnley some of the most advanced facilities in the country. Lord oversaw major redevelopment of Turf Moor, including a new stand at the Cricket Field end, and a replacement for the Main Stand that Lord named after himself. Both stands were opened by a friend of Lord, the Conservative Party leader Edward Heath.Inglis, The Football Grounds of Great Britain, p. 75. As of 2020, both the Cricket Field Stand and Bob Lord stand are still in use. Lord's media exclusions also extended to members of the press who he felt had slighted him. At the time of a 1966 interview with Arthur Hopcraft, Lord had banned three newspapers and six individual journalists from the Turf Moor press box, and Burnley players faced fines if they spoke to journalists without prior permission.Hopcraft, p. 148. His bearing and attitude led one press report to describe him as \\"the Khrushchev of Burnley\\".Hopcraft, p147. Lord was a staunch critic of televised football. He wrote at length on the subject in his 1963 autobiography, arguing that live coverage would \\"damage and undermine attendances\\".Allison, p. 50. When the BBC highlights programme Match of the Day began in 1964, Lord banned the BBC from televising matches from Burnley's Turf Moor ground, and maintained the ban for five years. As a result of his stance, no game is broadcast between 2.45pm and 5.15pm on Saturday in the United Kingdom, excluding the FA Cup Final. It is known as the \\"3pm Blackout\\". Lord was a guest of honour at a dinner given by the Variety Club of Great Britain in March 1974, but his speech led to a walkout by participants. Lord said: \\"We have to stand up against a move to get soccer on the cheap by the Jews who run TV.\\" Manny Cussins, who was Jewish and chairman of Leeds United, said he would walk out of the Elland Road boardroom if Lord visited when Burnley was playing there. Lord told his own board to stay away from the game. In 1962 neighbouring football club Accrington Stanley were bottom of the Fourth Division and facing severe financial difficulties. Lord and Sam Pilkington took control of the club, but following a meeting on 5 March at which debts of ¬£62,000 came to light, Lord withdrew his support.Inglis, League Football and the Men Who Made It, p. 231. The club resigned from the Football League the following day. A frequent critic of the football authorities, Lord relished the role of the outsider. In his autobiography he asked rhetorically \\"Who was the butcher's boy to be telling the big shots how to run their mismanaged business?\\"Inglis, League Football and the Men Who Made It, p. 269. He regularly made complaints to the Football League, to the point where the minutes of a League meeting stated that \\"It was decided unanimously that the Committee could not tolerate the irresponsible comments of Mr Lord.\\"Inglis, League Football and the Men Who Made It, p. 245. Among the positions he took on governance issues were support for the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) campaign to end the maximum wage, and calls for an end to the ban on paid directors and the introduction of professional referees.Hopcraft, p.148. Despite his clashes with authority Lord sought to become part of the football establishment. He was admitted to the Football League's Committee in 1967, nine years after his first attempt.Hopcraft, p. 149. While on the Committee, Lord was a strong opponent of matches being played on Sundays, an idea first proposed during the Three-Day Week fuel shortages of 1974.Inglis, League Football and the Men Who Made It, p. 265. He attempted to become League President twice. In the 1972 contest he had to withdraw through illness; in 1974 he lost to Lord Westwood by 41 votes to 6.Inglis, League Football and the Men Who Made It, pp. 269‚Äì70. Lord was made President of the Alliance Premier League (now the National League) upon its creation in 1979,Inglis, League Football and the Men Who Made It, p. 284. and had a non-league cup competition, the Bob Lord Trophy named after him. Following the resignation of Lord Westwood in March 1981, Lord became acting President of the Football League. However, ill health forced him to relinquish the position three months later.Inglis, League Football and the Men Who Made It, p. 291. His chairmanship of Burnley ended in September 1981 when he sold most of his shares in the club. Though Lord was still a Burnley director, by this time he was seriously ill, and died of cancer in December 1981.

About a year after it opened, it was burned to the ground by paranoid and angry townspeople of Marblehead, Massachusetts. History In June, 1773, Marblehead was stricken by an epidemic of smallpox. The typical response to an outbreak was undertaken by town officials, including daily surveillance of the inhabitants by a Committee of Inspection, fencing off of infected areas, moving infected people to pesthouses, inspecting cargo arriving into the town, and limiting out of town visitors. Some forward-thinking townspeople argued in favor of inoculation of the disease; diluted, contaminated material (pus) from a person with mild disease would be injected into a healthy person who would, with hope, develop a very mild case of the disease, fully recover, and then be immune. However, most people at the time were terrified of and vehemently opposed to the practice. On August 9, 1773, a Town Meeting in Marblehead was held to debate the construction of a public inoculation hospital on one of the nearby islands. The proposal was rejected, but the majority did agree to allow a private funding of a hospital as long as the Marblehead Selectmen could regulate it.Smith, Philip Chadwick Foster, ed. The Journals of Ashley Bowen(1728-1813) of Marblehead. 1973. Vol.II On August 17 a petition to build a private inoculation hospital on an island was sent to Governor Hutchinson who approved the measure. The owners of the future Essex Hospital were four popular Marblehead political figures: John Glover, Jonathan Glover (John Glover's brother), Azor Orne, and Elbridge Gerry; they purchased Children's Island (Catt Island) on September 2, 1773. Despite having received permission from the town, their decision to inoculate remained contentious. Many Marbleheaders feared that the inoculation process would cause new outbreaks of the disease and that the hospital itself would scare off merchant ships arriving at Marblehead and Salem Harbors. Some opponents of the hospital also denigrated the plan as a get-rich scheme by the proprietors. In response to the fear the town selectmen prescribed strict rules to which the proprietors agreed. On October 5 to help alleviate some concerns \\"The Rules and Regulations of the Essex Hospital on Catt Island\\" were published in the local newspaper, The Essex Gazette. These rules required guards to be posted on the island to ensure no one would come ashore without a permit and no one would leave the island without a health clearance from a physician. No boat other than the hospitals' were to approach the island, and once returned to Marblehead were to dock only at approved locations within the harbor. People on the island were not to approach the island landing and a fence and trench would separate areas where supplies were dropped off from areas used by people on the island.Essex Gazette, Sept 28-Oct. 5, 1773. By early October, the hospital and a shifting-house were completed. Upon arriving on a beach at the northwest part of the island the new patients would enter the clean room of the small, one-story shifting house where they left a clean set of clothes to be worn upon departing. Another room in the building, the shifting-room, as where at the end of their island stay they would strip, wash, and be fumigated before entering the clean-room and getting dressed in the previously left, uncontaminated clothes. The hospital itself was located on the southwestern section of the island, was three stories high, had ten rooms each with four beds, a kitchen, and accommodations for a steward, the physicians, nurses, and their assistants. The proprietors of the hospital employed Dr. Hall Jackson from Portsmouth as hospital superintendent, and Dr. Ananias Randall from Long Island as assistant physician.Hall Jackson and the Purple Foxglove, p.26 The proprietors set a fee \\"for board, nursing, inoculation, etc., and for the poor which are considerably numerous, inoculation gratis one poor inhabitant for every ten others inoculated.\\"Essex Gazette, Sept. 28-Oct 5, 1773 Two boats were employed, the Mercury Cruiser to transport people, and the Noah's Ark to transport cattle, sheep, deer, and animal feed. On October 19, Among the first class of patients were Captain John Glover and his family, all of whom were inoculated and then remained as volunteers. Ashley Bowen, exemplifying some of the bitter feelings toward the hospital, sarcastically noted in his journal on October 19: Since those exposed to smallpox (including recently inoculated) are not contagious for 10 days, visitors were allowed during this time.Hall Jackson p.28 A newspaper article at the time notes, the patients \\"are indeed confined to a strict regimen; but they may every day be seen walking the island, shooting wild fowl, playing at quoits, etc.\\"Essex Gazette, October 29 On November 5, 1773 the patients and staff on the island celebrated Pope's Day (a colonial variant of Guy Fawkes Day) by lighting tar barrels \\"and a large fire displayed from the middle of the Island; the hospital was likewise illuminated, and made a most beautiful appearance here. Rockets were ordered from Boston ... a number of gentlemen, who spent the evening in the assembly room, had them played off from their quarters, and spent the evening after very jovially, as did their friends and acquaintance under inoculation.\\"Essex Gazette, 11/2-9/1773 Most of the first class of patients were able to leave the hospital from November 9-11th. On November 15, the second class of patients, numbering around 100, were inoculated at Essex Hospital. One of the members of this second group was Captain Lowell of Newburyport, who on December 4, 1773 was severely injured while loading a four-pound cannon on the island. Both arms were amputated, one eye was destroyed and the other severely injured, and his upper chest and neck were severely injured.Essex Gazette November 30-December 7, 1773 Dr. Jackson performed immediate surgery, and Captain Lowell was able to leave the hospital on January 16, 1774. As of January 26, he was still alive.The Essex Journal and Merimak Packet January 26, 1774 The third class of patients was inoculated at the hospital on December 15, 1773. Destruction In early January 1774, a boatload of this third class was discharged from the island but attempted to land at Nick's Cove, an unsanctioned landing area in Marblehead.Essex Gazette, January 11‚Äì18, 1774. Many townspeople were upset and a period of disorder and riots ensued. On January 12, the hospital boat Mercury was set on fire in Marblehead Harbor. One week later four townsmen were caught stealing contaminated clothing from the island while attempting to smuggle them into Marblehead. Presumably, they were hoping to earn condemnation for the hospital by starting an outbreak of smallpox. The following morning the four were tarred and feathered and paraded through Marblehead into Salem, a source of much entertainment to those witnessing the spectacle.Essex Gazette, January 18‚Äì25, 1774 Due to ongoing opposition, the hospital proprietors called for a town meeting on January 24 to ask the town to purchase the hospital and supplies, and to decide if the hospital should be kept open. Alternatively, they requested that if the hospital be closed that \\"a committee to cleanse the furniture, etc. in the so just and most satisfactory manner to the Town\\" be formed. The town refused to buy the hospital and supplies but did form a committee to oversee disinfection.Searle, Richard W. History of Catta Iland Off Marblehead in The Essex Institute Historical Collections. Vol. LXXXIII, Oct. 1947 On the following day, the three committee members and eight members of their family spent the next two days on the island cleaning and disinfecting, when on the second night they were suddenly awakened by fire. During the night, approximately 20 townspeople had snuck onto the island and set the hospital on fire. Everyone escaped alive but all buildings and property were burned or destroyed.Essex Gazette, January 25-Feb 1, 1774 For the rest of January and into February, Marblehead was in a general state of uproar. A military watch was formed and the General Court of Massachusetts was petitioned to help restore order.Essex Gazette February 8‚Äì15, 1774. At the end of February, John Watts and John Guillard of Marblehead were arrested for suspicion of burning the hospital. They were jailed in Salem but were freed the same night by a violent mob from Marblehead.Essex Gazette February 22-March 1, 1774 Within a week the High Sheriff of the County called for help in apprehending the accused and their rescuers. At the same time, a large group from Marblehead called for arms to defend the two men. To quell the inevitable violence, the four owners of the Essex Hospital nobly dropped all charges and refused to pursue the matter further.Essex Gazette, March 1‚Äì8, 1774 The final act of the \\"smallpox war\\" occurred in March when one of the men who had been tarred and feathered for attempting to smuggle clothes from the island was caught trying to recover more clothing from the island. That night he was dragged from bed by an unruly mob and publicly whipped.Essex Gazette, March 29-April 5, 1774 These events were quickly forgotten as thoughts turned toward revolution. The owners of the former Essex Hospital held the Island throughout the American Revolutionary War. Sometime before 1787 both Glovers sold their quarter ownerships to Deacon William Williams of Marblehead. The Deacon then acquired another 16th part to gain majority ownership. After his death in 1787, his wife sold the property to Edward Fettyplace for $43.33 on June 25, 1795.

The library is located within the Hazel McCallion Academic Learning Centre. Named to honour City of Mississauga mayor Hazel McCallion. The facility houses the library, the Robert Gillespie Academic Skills Centre, a Library Caf√©, a digital environment, a classroom, an adaptive technology centre, a finance learning centre, and the campus‚Äô academic skills centre. History The library began as the Erindale College Library began when the University of Toronto‚Äôs Erindale College was created in 1967. Initially, it was a small, mainly undergraduate library located in the campus‚Äô North Building. In 1972, it moved to a facility in the South Building (renamed the William G. Davis Building in 2009-10), becoming a full service campus library. Early in 2000, the Erindale College Library was renamed the University of Toronto Mississauga Library. In 2004, construction began on a new , $34-million library building project‚Äîthe Hazel McCallion Academic Learning Centre. The new facility increased study space by 85 per cent, and better accommodated the campus‚Äô growing student population than its predecessor, which was built for a student population half the size. The Hazel McCallion Academic Learning Centre opened for student use in October 2006. Collections The library has a collection of print, electronic and networked resources in a wired and wireless environment. Its permanent collection comprises more than 400,000 volumes. Facility Designed by Shore Tilbe Irwin & Partners (now Perkins + Will Toronto), the library facility represents a ‚Äònew breed‚Äô of libraries referred to as ‚ÄòAcademic Learning Centres‚Äô focused more on learning or ‚Äòpeople‚Äô space over space for collections and interested in engaging users in its teaching and learning mission. The Hazel McCallion Academic Learning Centre features high density mobile compact shelving that houses the library‚Äôs permanent collection as well as generous perimeter space for quiet study and collaborative learning, all with views to the surrounding campus and natural landscape. The building was the first at the University of Toronto to receive a silver LEEDs rating (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design). The design was inspired by the metaphor of a Japanese puzzle box, explained Andrew Frontini, the design architect: ‚ÄúWe stumbled on the idea of a puzzle box, which is a three-dimensional geometrical puzzle box, inside of which is a treasure,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a treasure in the centre, and for the library, the treasure is knowledge. So, in the centre of the building is where all the computers are, and all the books are, so when people use the building, they go to the centre to gain knowledge.‚Äù The library is divided into Learning Zones: Quiet Conversation Zones where students are encouraged to work together on their academic projects, Silent Study Zones to provide environments for deep thinking and reflection, as well as Conversation- and Cell Phone-Friendly Zones in busier areas. Zones are marked with signs as well as glass installations, acoustical panels and appropriate furniture. Specialized Learning Spaces The Hazel McCallion Academic Learning Centre features specialized learning spaces, including: * Adaptive Technology Centre ‚Äì A space with specialized assistive software, equipment and services to support student needs. * Amgen Canada Inc. Smart Classroom ‚Äì A teaching space where students learn research, information, technological and spatial literacy skills. This space also functions as an extension of the Learning Commons, providing access to electronic resources and application software. * AstraZeneca Canada Centre for Information and Technological Literacy ‚Äì A space that provides support in the areas of instructional technology, geographic information systems, video, statistical software and data. * Avie Bennett Community Novelties Reading Area ‚Äì A space for leisure reading. * Li Koon Chun Finance Learning Centre ‚Äì featuring a classroom and work space that ‚Äúlooks more like the floor of a stock exchange‚Äù.

It is endemic to the Eastern United States. Description This species can reach a length of , though most are only about . Ot has a narrow, laterally compressed body with a rounded head and a blunt, conical snoutwhich does not extend past the upper lips. The lateral line curves slightly upwards towards the tail. In color they are green to tan dorsally with small dark saddles and dark green and brown mottling. There are 10-12 square-shaped markings on the flanks. The underparts are white to yellow with numerous black and brown speckles. There is a narrow suborbital bar and 3 dusky black spots on the caudal fin. The rays in the fins are marked with small spots and the spiny part of the male's dorsal fin normally has a dark band at its base and another dark submarginal band. When breeding, the males become darker and tubercles develop on the soft rays of the pelvic and anal fins, the spine in the pelvic fin and frequently grow on the second spine of the anal fin. the second anal spine. Distribution The swamp darter has a wide distribution in the lowlands of the eastern United States, it is generally found below the fall line on the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains from southern Maine to the Sabine River, Louisiana and the Red River of the South in southeastern Oklahoma. It is also found in the tributaries of the Mississippi River as far north as Kentucky and southeastern Missouri. An introduced swamp darter population is established in the French Broad River system in North Carolina. In New York State the swamp darter only occurs in the Peconic River and in a small number of ponds in the vicinity of that river in eastern Long Island, the swamp darter also extends up the Red River of the South drainage as far as North Texas and Southeastern Oklahoma, where it is rare. No other darter is found as far south as E. fusiforme. Habitat and biology The swamp darter is found in slow moving and still waters, like ditches and oxbow lakes, which are typical of low-lying coastal plains. It seems to show a preference for clearer water areas where there is more vegetation than the sympatric slough darter (Etheostoma gracile). They can be found in flowing water but prefer still water including backwaters and ponds, including beaver dams. They are normally found in dark acidic waters but can thrive in clearwater if sufficient cover is available. Swamp darters feed on fly larvae, amphipods, and other small crustaceans and insects. Swamp darters tend to be an important element in the diets of young chain pickerel and young largemouth bass, where the species coexist. Spawning is thought to occur in May in New Jersey; elsewhere, breeding individuals have been collected in March, April, and May. Swamp darters are not bashful about spawning. They typically spawn in the same habitats where they are found. The male approaches a female from the rear, mounts her, and beats her with his pelvic fins. The female then leads the male into aquatic plants, where the eggs are deposited singly on leaves. No parental care of the eggs has been observed, and no information regarding the number of males with which females spawn and vice versa. No fighting or display of territoriality is typically observed. For many populations of the swamp darter, maximum longevity is only one year, with very few individuals surviving two years. Conservation The swamp darter has suffered local declines and extinctions due to alteration of its habitats by humans, urbanisation and agricultural works such as canalization, drainage, pollution and siltation have reduced the available habitat. It is localized and uncommon on the margins of its range, for example it is classified as endangered in Missouri. Overall it wide range, large population size, large number of populations and overall stability of numbers has led the IUCN to classify the swamp darter as Least Concern. Taxonomy and etymology The swamp darter was first formally described in 1854 as Boleosoma fusiforme by the French biologist Charles Fr√©d√©ric Girard (1822-1895) with the type locality given as a tributary of Charles River at Framingham, Massachusetts. It has been placed in the subgenus Hololepsis' or in the larger Boleichthys. There are two recognised subspecies, although many have been proposed in the past: * E.f. barretti: from the Pee Dee River in South Carolina and including the southern and western parts of its range * E.f. fusiforme: the northern Atlantic coastal range from the Waccamaw River, North Carolina as far as Maine The specific name means \\"spindle shaped\\" or tapering at each end.

Arkansas and South Carolina joined the SEC in 1991, and the conference was split into two six-team divisions in 1992. Since then, Florida has been a member of the SEC East Division, and Auburn has been a member of the SEC West Division. At first, every SEC team played an annual game against two permanent rivals in the other division and a third cross-divisional game that rotated among the other four teams in that division. Auburn's original two cross-division rivals were Georgia and Florida; Florida's were LSU and Auburn. In 2002, the SEC changed the cross-division format to one permanent rival and two rotating teams. Since Auburn's rivalry with Georgia was older and more notable, Georgia remained Auburn's lone cross-division rival while Florida retained their annual game against LSU, and the previously annual Auburn‚ÄìFlorida football rivalry became an intermittent one. From 2003-2011, the teams were scheduled to play two games every five-year cycle. In 2012, the SEC added Missouri and Texas A&M;, but kept the football schedule at eight games per season. As a result, Auburn and Florida now play only two games per 12-year cycle.  Game results   Notable games  Most great rivalries are marked by frequent close games, unexpected upsets, and memorable moments; the evenly matched Auburn-Florida rivalry has provided many. Thirty-three of the eighty-two games in the series have been decided by seven points or fewer. Among SEC rivalries, the Auburn‚ÄìFlorida series (43‚Äì39‚Äì2) is the third-most evenly matched after the Georgia-Auburn series (55‚Äì55‚Äì8) and the Florida‚ÄìTennessee series (26‚Äì19).

The decisive score came late in the game when Gators quarterback Jimmy Fisher tossed a short pass to wide receiver Wes Chandler, who caught it, reversed direction twice, and weaved his way through the entire Auburn defense for a 64-yard touchdown reception and run.Jack Hairston, \\"Gators' big-play offense kills Tigers,\\" The Gainesville Sun (October 31, 1976). After Chandler ran out of the end zone, Auburn's War Eagle, Tiger, jumped off its perch to avoid a collision, her talons grazing Chandler's shoulder pads, an encounter Chandler later described as an attack.Golenbock, Go Gators!, p. 391. For decades, a coincidental 15-yard penalty assessed on the ensuing kickoff against Auburn for a late hit on Chandler has been mistakenly reported as an infraction stemming from interference by a mascot. Florida won 24‚àí19. 1982: Gainey wins for Gators Auburn led 17‚Äì13 with 2:51 remaining in the game.

Phillips and his associates formed the Salem and Lowell Railroad Company. By the summer of 1850 the railroad was opened; it terminated at Phillips Wharf in Salem. The company's hope was to compete with the Boston and Lowell Railroad by restoring Salem's lost commerce. To increase demand, the company created a seaside resort near Salem. In May 1851, the Salem Steamboat Company was formed \\"to purchase, build, charter or otherwise hold and employ a steamboat to be used in and about the harbor of Salem, as well as to hold real estate to an amount not exceeding $1000\\" On June 11, 1851, Stephen Phillips purchased Children's Island (formerly Cat Island) from David Blaney for USD$1000. In January 1852, he transferred the deed to the Salem Steamboat Company. Lowell Island The company immediately advertised trips to the renamed Lowell Island, with the first trip leaving from Phillips Wharf in Salem on August 15, 1851. The initial day was successful, but entertaining the customers was difficult because, \\"at the time of the purchase of the island the only building upon it was one used by fishermen as a fish-house.\\" However, \\"this was altered and enlarged to serve as a place of resort and entertainment for visitors. It was partitioned off so as to accommodate as many as possible in a given space.\\" Encouraged by the turnout, the owners raised money to build the Lowell Island Hotel.Gilman, Alfred.

The property was subsequently mortgaged and transferred between members of the company, until finally in July, 1857, \\"the establishment, including steamboat, was sold to Gorham L.

After a home education she studied at the Art Students' League and exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show. She was married to the painter Andrew Dasburg, and the couple were parts of the artistic communities of Paris, New York, and New Mexico. Early life Johnson was born July 28 1882 in New York City to Laura Mott Riverdale and Alfred Van Cleve Johnson, a Presbyterian minister. Her grandfather was the classical scholar Ebenezer Alfred Johnson. Her mother died two years after she was born, so she and her seven siblings were raised by her father. Her early years were spent being home-schooled on a farm in Yonkers, New York. (Google Books) She began drawing when she was four years old, and when the family moved to a farm in 1900 she enjoyed sketching horses and other farm animals. At the age of 22, she left home to study at the Art Students' League with sculptors Gutzon Borglum and James Earle Fraser, and also attended Birge Harrison's painting class in Woodstock. Throughout her career she would sculpt animals from memory, as she was adamant that animals could not be sketched. She would often attend circuses and farms for inspiration. In fact, for many summers she followed traveling circuses to observe the animals. (direct link to article scan)  Career  Elephant sculpture In 1909, Johnson and painter Andrew Dasburg went to Paris and joined the modernist circle of artists living there, including Morgan Russell, Jo Davidson, and Arthur Lee. During a trip to London that same year they were married. Johnson returned to the United States early the next year, but Dasburg stayed in Paris where he met Henri Matisse, Gertrude Stein and Leo Stein, and became influenced by the paintings of C√©zanne and Cubism. He returned to Woodstock, New York in August and he and Johnson became active members of the artist community. In 1911, their son Alfred was born. Both Dasburg and Johnson showed several works at the legendary Armory Show in 1913. After several years of exhibiting single pieces, her first general exhibition was in 1917 at the studio of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. She also had joint exhibitions at the Whitney Studio Club, co-exhibiting with Florence Lucius (1919) and Lila Wheelock (1923). Dasburg and Johnson lived apart for most of their marriage. By 1917, they had separated and Dasburg began teaching painting in Woodstock and in New York City. In 1918, he was invited to Taos, New Mexico by Mabel Dodge, where she was associated with Dodge's artist colony. Returning in 1919, Johnson joined him there for a period of time. In 1922, Dasburg and Johnson divorced. Grace Mott Johnson lived in the Johnson family home in Yonkers, New York during the 1920s, moving to Pleasantville, New York in 1927. In 1924 she went to Egypt to study ancient Egyptian sculpture. In 1929 she had a solo exhibition of her sculpture and drawings at the Art Gallery of the Museum of New Mexico. During the 1930s, she became a civil rights activist. She had many friends in the arts community in Harlem and was an active representative of the NAACP. (direct link to article scan) (direct link to article scan) She produced a notable series of portraits of African American adults and children. She produced very little art during the last twenty years of her life. Chimpanzees, 1912 Writings by Johnson were also found which included two brief autobiographical writings which described her early life. These included what it was like living on a farm, her interests in art and art education. She also worked on a home-made magazine called The Johnson Monthly which she made with her siblings, the illustrations in the magazine were done by Johnson. Additionally, she had written poems, writings about civil rights, and loose diary-style writings which expressed her thoughts. Her sketchbooks mainly included charcoal and pencil drawings of animals, landscapes, and other designs. Preliminary sketches of her animal sculptures were also included as well as sketches of her son.  Awards  In 1917, Johnson was awarded the Macmillan Sculpture Prize at New York City's National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. She was also awarded the Joan of Arc Medal in 1927.  Legacy  Her artwork is still highly valued within the art community, with it going above estimates in auction. Her sculpture of a Grey hound sold for $3,884 at auction in 2006, which was 56% above the estimate. Her portrait of a hunting dog sold for 549% above estimated auction. Her bronze figure of a lamb sold for $2,420 when the estimate was $1,000-$1,500.

Children's Island was for many years the location of a failed Island House (Lowell island house), and was finally donated by its final owner, Mr. Fredrick Rindge, to develop what became known as the \\"Children's Island Sanitarium, a corporation duly established...subject to the following conditions ‚ÄòThat said property shall be used by the Children's Island Sanitarium only for the use and purpose for which said corporation was organized...and the property will revert and reinvest in me and my heirs and assigns.'‚ÄùGilman, Alfred.

A Journal of Organized Philanthropy. Vol II ‚Äì 1887. p. 434 The Sisterhood of Margaret of Boston were chosen to run the Sanitarium. This society was already very involved in the Children's Hospital in Boston and the Sea-Shore Home in Winthrop, so its members had experience with the recovery of ill or crippled children. In the late 19th century, ‚Äúsea air [was] looked upon as almost a panacea for that class of disorders of nutrition which is shown in the disorders of joints and bones,...(and) in adopting the sea coast plan for their Institute the managers of the Lowell Island Sanitorium...hope that the beneficial effect of sea air would be especially manifest in children suffering from chronic malnutrition, a belief which is entertained by all medical authorities.‚Äù.An Island Sanatorium for Children in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal. July 22, 1886. p. 68. On July 11, 1886 the Children's Island Sanitarium was opened for nearly two months and hosted a total of 150 children ‚Äúexposed to the summer diseases of crowded cities, or to children...troubled by the affliction popularly called ‚Äòrickets‚Äô.‚Äù The children were carefully selected and initially \\"boys under 10 and girls of any age or race, suffering from the chronic diseases which are benefited by a marine atmosphere, such as rickets, hip, spinal diseases, etc.; also, for children convalescing from severe operations\\" were eligible for admission. \\"Children (were) admitted free when circumstances demand(ed). The usual stay is a fortnight, which (was) extended when necessary.\\"A Directory of the Charitable and Beneficient Organizations of Boston. 3rd ed. 1891. p. 14 Despite the belief that the Children's Island Sanitarium was a tuberculosis sanitarium, no child with a contagious disease, especially active tuberculosis, was admitted. Joint and bone infections (osteomyelitis), both TB and non-TB, are not contagious and these children were admitted. Many other children who were there suffered deformities from rickets or vitamin D deficiency. In addition to children, the Sanitarium allowed ‚Äúworking women in need of a holiday (to) be received on the payment of a sufficient sum to defray the cost of their board.‚ÄùLouise, Sister Catherine. The House of My Pilgrimage. History of the American House of the Society of St. Margaret 1873‚Äì1973. p. 52. A journalist from the Boston Transcript spent a day in September, 1890 on the Island and wrote: ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs island sanitarium...was carried on by the Sisters (of St. Margaret) for 15 years; at the end of that time the old house had gone to pieces and a new building was erected, but in this there were only accommodations for the children and those in charge of them. This changed the whole character of the work and in 1900 the Mother decided to give it up.The House of My Pilgrimage Subsequently, a new Board of Managers to oversee the operation of the sanitarium was formed with Dr. Charles E. Inches as president (replaced by Phillip L. Saltonstall in 1905.Annual Report of the State Board of Charity of Massachusetts. January, 1905. p. 190), and Mrs. Lucy W. Davis as superintendent.23rd Annual Report of the State Board of Charity of Massachusetts. January, 1902. p. 310. It seems that most of the tasks previously carried out by the Sisters were now carried out by volunteers who were \\"young women who give their time and services out of love for the little people and interest in the cause. They remain on the average, three weeks, and are on either morning or afternoon duty for a week at a time-four in the morning, three in the afternoon.\\"Curtiss, Maude S.

Serving in the Royal Canadian Dragoons, he became the most famous Canadian casualty of the Second Boer War. Queen Victoria asked F. W. Borden for a photograph of his son, Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier praised his services, tributes arrived from across Canada, and in his home town a monument (by Hamilton MacCarthy) was erected to his memory. Early life Borden was born in 1876. He acquired an arts degree at Mount Allison University and was enrolled in medical school at McGill University when he enlisted in the war. Military career Sir Frederick Borden ‚Äì While Canadian Minister of Defence, his only son Harold was killed in war Borden's military career began in 1893, when he entered the King's Canadian Hussars. In 1897, as a member of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Contingent he received the Jubilee Medal. By 1899 he rose to major in command of this corps. At the outbreak of the Second Boer War Borden received a commission as lieutenant with the 1st Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles (which shortly after his death became known as the Royal Canadian Dragoons (Special Service Force)) and allotted to the 1st Battalion, \\"B\\" Squadron as officer commanding the 4th Troop. He was brought to the attention of Field Marshal Lord Roberts', the British commander-in-chief in South Africa, for repeatedly swimming with Richard Turner across the Vet River at Coetzee's Drift, to draw the fire of the Boers who were dug in on the north bank (5 May 1900). Borden also fought with distinction at the Battle of Faber's Put (30 May 1900). The battle was one of the most desperate actions faced by Canadians while campaigning in South Africa: 27 killed, 41 wounded, and the loss of a large number of horses. Field Marshal Lord Roberts reported: \\"Lieut. H. L. Borden, gallant conduct in swimming the Vet River under fire, 5 May, and in capturing some of the enemy‚Äôs wagons on 30 May.\\" The death of Lieutenant Harold Lothrop Borden at Witpoort on 16 July 1900 occurred when Lieutenant John Edgar Burch and he, while assisting the Royal Irish Fusiliers and some New Zealanders withstand a Boer assault on Witpoort ridge, led a counter-attack. It was successful, but Boer marksmen, standing less than 200 metres away, shot them as they stood up to lead the assault. Lord Roberts reported to the War Office that Borden and Burch \\"were killed while gallantly leading their men in a counter attack upon the enemy's flank at a critical juncture of his assault upon our position.\\" Legacy Borden is commemorated with various monuments and plaques. In his home town, Canning, Nova Scotia is a statue by Hamilton MacCarthy.extensive photographs, including dedication of statue: http://www.ns1763.ca/kingsco/borden_h.html In Halifax, Nova Scotia the base of the South African War Memorial has a panel commemorating the Battle of Witpoort. There is also a memorial plaque to Borden at McGill University, Montreal, in the Strathcona Medical Building (now the Strathcona Anatomy and Dentistry Building)see Wikipedia article \\"McGill University\\": McGill University. Borden was a medical student at McGill before joining the war effort. He is listed on the Memorial Arch at the Royal Military College of Canada. Finally, there is also a plaque to Borden and others who died at Witpoort at Braamfontein Cemetery in South Africa where he is buried.

He was born in Newport, Rhode Island, the son of Edward Huntington Brinley and Rebecca Maitland Porter Brinley. Brinley spent his childhood at his parents' home in Cos Cob, Connecticut, where he was known affectionately as \\"Put\\". During the 1890s, he came to the attention of local artists when he watched them at work. Brinley studied at the Art Students League of New York from 1900 to 1902. While there, he studied with Bryson Burroughs, Benjamin West Clinedinst, and Henry Siddons Mowbray, and was most influenced by Kenyon Cox and John Henry Twachtman. Life and career In 1904, Brinley married his childhood friend, Kathrine Gordon Sanger, whom he had begun courting during the 1890s. Kathrine would later achieve fame in her own right as an author of travel books. The two of them spent the next four years traveling through Europe, including trips to Rome, Florence, Venice, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. They then spent nearly two years in Paris, where Daniel was influential in organizing the New Society of American Painters in Paris. Brinley had previously been an impressionist landscape painter under Twachtman's influence, but he studied art independently while abroad and began to gravitate toward the Modernist school of art. In 1908, the Brinleys returned to the United States, and Daniel established a studio in New York City. During this period his work was heavily influenced by the modernist movement, with flattened forms and a deeper hued palette. Brinley had his first one-man show at Madison Avenue Galleries in 1910, exhibited at Alfred Stieglitz's gallery at 291, and helped organize the 1913 Armory Show. He was also a founding member of the Association of American Painters and Sculptors and the Grand Central Art Galleries. In 1914 the Brinleys built a home, Datchet House, in Silvermine (New Canaan) Connecticut, designed by their friend Austin W. Lord, and spent part of each year there for the remainder of their lives.W. H. de B. Nelson, ‚ÄúA Studio Home in Connecticut,‚Äù International Studio, vol. 53 no. 212 (October 1914), pp. lxv-lxvii. In 1919, Brinley is returned to France after the First World War to see the ravages of destruction. He was so shocked that he decided, with the \\"Young Men's Christian Association\\" (Y.M.C.A), to paint the crumbling buildings in order to never forget this devastation. His drawings were gathered in a French book named \\"Ruines de Guerre\\" (War of Ruines). Brinley was a charter member of the Silvermine Guild of Artists in 1922.American Art News, Vol. 21, No. 6 (November 16, 1922), p. 8. During the 1930s Brinley earned considerable fame and profit from his murals. A biographical sketch of Brinley featured in the 22nd edition of Who's Who in America, issued in the early 1940s, identified him as Republican and of the Episcopalian faith. In 1930, Brinley was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member. Brinley died on July 31, 1963 in New Canaan, following a brief illness. He was survived only by his wife. Notable works The lobby of the Daily News Building in New York City, featuring Brinley's Great Terrestrial Globe. At the time of Brinley's death, many obituaries noted the decorative maps that he created for Liberty Memorial, in Kansas City, Missouri. These maps, painted in 1926, continue to be a permanent exhibit in Memory Hall of the National World War I Museum, which is now part of the Memorial site. Brinley also created a mural for the Brooklyn Savings Bank, for which he was awarded the Gold Medal of Honor of the Architectural League of New York. Finally, he created the Great Terrestrial Globe that sat in the lobby of the Daily News Building in New York City. References  Further reading  Loder, Elizabeth M. D.

The island's main function is as a base for a lighthouse; a military fort on the island was abandoned in the 1930s. History of lighthouse and fort The island's lighthouse has been in operation since 1700; it is named for the opposite point on the mainland, Hoek van 't IJ, or \\"Corner of the IJ\\". The first lighthouse was a square, stone building. In 1809, the island was equipped with a military post, which, in 1844, was expanded to a real fort, which, in 1883, became a part of the Stelling van Amsterdam. The lighthouse was replaced with a cast-iron construction in 1893, which is still standing. At the end of the nineteenth century, a bomb-proof building and artillery battery were built on the island, but its five guns were moved to Den Helder in 1904. In 1959, it was delisted as a stronghold, but the last soldiers had left long before. In 1981, the island was listed as a Rijksmonument, and in 1996, a bridge was built, which connected the island and the mainland. The fog signal was deactivated in 2001, and the light was extinguished in 2003, when the last lighthouse keeper retired. It was rekindled in 2005. Current status The island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is owned by the Dutch state, and is managed by Staatsbosbeheer.

It manufactures some of the most well-known health remedies and over-the-counter medicines (OTC) found in British chemists. Around six hundred people work on the site. History The name comes from Sir William Crookes, a chemist. Crookes Collosols, started by Henry Crookes the son of William Crookes, was formed on 29 March 1912. British Colloids Ltd, formed in December 1918, bought this company in January 1919. In 1946 it became The Crookes Laboratories Ltd, on Gorst Road in north-west London. It became a public company on 28 February 1951. Crookes Laboratories was an international company. One of its best selling products was the LactoCalamine skin-care range. This latter featured the Hollywood film star Audrey Hepburn in its adverts. By the 1960s it was making dosulepin, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), under the brand name Prothiaden. Ownership Guinness In November 1960 it was bought by Arthur Guinness Son and Company in a joint-venture with Philips-Duphar (part of Philips Electrical Industries) of the Netherlands, who owned 40%. In April 1969 Guinness acquired the rest of Crookes Laboratories. There were two main divisions * Crookes Laboratories Group * Crookes Anestan ‚Äì toiletries Both companies were profitable. Crookes Veterinary began in September 1969. Although veterinary products had formed part of the products range well before this date; E.g Vivomin a food supplement for animals. Boots Boots of Nottingham agreed to buy the two divisions of the company on 26 July 1971 for around ¬£2 million. At this point its turnover was around ¬£700,000 a year.Boots timeline The Crookes Veterinary Ltd division was sold to Anglian Food Group for ¬£260,000. This company moved to central Birmingham and was wound up around 1997. By the early 1980s Boots had amalgamated its most common household medical products into its Crookes Products division, which is much the form that the company retains today. In the 1980s its main competitor was the Beecham Group for OTC medicines, and with Warner-Lambert the three had about half of the market. In October 1987 it claimed to be Britain's leading manufacturer of OTC medicines. In February 1983, Boots bought Optrex Ltd. (which had been bought by Hoechst AG in 1976) for around ¬£10 million; Optrex had been based at 17 Wadsworth Road in Perivale from the 1930s. In October 1990, it bought Mycil from Medeva plc (who were bought by Celltech in November 1999). Under Boots, the main money- spinner of the Crookes Products division was Nurofen (Ibuprofen or Brufen), which Boots had patented in 1962, developed by Stewart Adams (chemist) and launched on 8 August 1983. By the late 1980s Nurofen had a 12% share of the analgesics market. Gold Greenlees Trott (GGT), who later bought BBDP then were bought by Omnicom Group in 1998 and made part of TBWA Worldwide, were commissioned to make an advert to markedly increase Nurofen's market share. Analgesics are mainly purchased by 25- to 40-year-old women. The 30 second TV advert, launched on 3 May 1989, used the voice instrumental section by Clare Torry (for which she was originally paid ¬£150) of The Great Gig in the Sky. It was the first time that an analgesic brand had been advertised in such fashion, and the first time that music from Pink Floyd had been used in TV advertising; they only agreed after seeing the produced advert. From 2000‚Äì2006 it also made Clearasil, the skin-care product. Reckitt Benckiser Reckitt Benckiser bought Boots Healthcare International (BHI) for ¬£1.9 billion in 2005, which required regulatory approval in early 2006. Products Nurofen (ibuprofen) The household-name products it makes are: * Nurofen * Strepsils * E45 skincare * Optrex (chloramphenicol) * Sweetex * Mycil (chlorphenesin) * Karvol * Dequacaine (Menthol flavoured Throat lozenges containing anaesthetic) In 2016 Nurofen was one of the biggest selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of ¬£116.8 million. Optrex had sales of ¬£39 million and Strepsils ¬£34.4 million.

It took place from 19 to 22 August 1936 during the Spanish Civil War. Background. On 18 July, the military governor of Cordoba, Ciriaco Cascajo, started the coup in the city, bombing the civil government and arresting the civil governor, Rodriguez de Leon. After that, he and Major Bruno Iba√±ez, Don Bruno, carried out a bloody repression (in the first weeks, 2,000 persons were executed). In the second week of August, the Nationalist troops were reinforced by 400 regulares who, led by Colonel Varela, after the capture of Huelva, launched an attack eastwards from Seville in order to relieve the besieged nationalist-held city of Granada. After a corridor to the city was established, Varela prepared to attack Malaga. At that point, the Republican Army launched an attack in order to recover C√≥rdoba. The offensive The Republican force, led by General Miaja, was composed of 3,000 men, mainly regular troops, civil guards, militiamen from Madrid and local volunteers. Opposing them, the Nationalists had the small force of the Nationalist commander in Cordoba, Colonel Cascajo, and the column of Colonel Varela. The Nationalists also had one DC-2 and several Sa-81 bombers. The advance of Miaja's force had started on August 5, but its advance was very slow and only occupied small towns like Adamuz and Pozoblanco. The Republican attack against Cordoba itself started on August 20. The Republican troops reached the gates of Cordoba (5 km from the city), but they were beaten back and the attack failed on August 22. According to Thomas, the offensive failed because of the skillful use of the Italian Savoia bombers and because Cascajo threatened to execute the family of Miaja who were in Cordoba. According to Beevor, the attack failed because of the incompetence of Miaja and the Republican professional officers. Furthermore, many of Miaja's officers were, in fact, Nationalist supporters (Miaja's adjutant was hoping to cross the lines and, on August 23 one captain, Antonio Reparaz, deserted with 200 civil guards). Aftermath Nationalist repression in the towns briefly occupied by the Republicans was very harsh. In the town of Palma del Rio, a local landowner killed 300 supporters of the Republic (the Republicans had killed 42 supporters of the Nationalists there). After a nationalist counter- offensive in September, the Cordoba front was stabilised.

The Republican army surrounded around 1,200 rebel civil guards and falangists who supported the Nationalists and forced them to surrender after a protracted offensive. Background. After the failed coup of July 1936 in Andalusia, many groups of rebel civil guards retreated from their garrisons to hilltops, monasteries and others easily defensible points, living by robbing from the neighborhood. The longest surviving group of rebels was the encampment of the Nuestra Se√±ora de la Cabeza's Sanctuary.

During the first months of the war, there had been no attack launched against this enclave, because the Republican committee of And√∫jar did not know that the civil guards of the shrine were rebels. After gathering a good supply of food, the civil guards decided to send a declaration of war to the committee in September 1936. Their commander, Major Nofuentes, who wanted to surrender, was deposed by captain Santiago Cort√©s and the Republicans started the siege. Nationalist aircraft from C√≥rdoba and Seville dropped supplies into the encampment (160,000 pounds of food from Seville and 140,000 pounds from C√≥rdoba). Medical supplies and delicate goods were attached to live turkeys. Furthermore, pigeons sent news and messages to the Nationalists in Seville. In December 1936, Queipo de Llano launched an offensive in order to occupy And√∫jar and relieve the shrine, but the offensive was stopped at Lopera in January 1937 (20 milles away from And√∫jar). In April 1937, the Republican government decided to crush the resistance of the rebels and sent a large force (20,000 men), led by communist major Mart√≠nez Cart√≥n. The Republican forces split the rebel enclave in two and conquered the encampment of Lugar Nuevo. Franco then gave permission to Cort√©s to evacuate women and children and to surrender should resistance become impossible, but Cort√©s rejected the evacuation of the women and children. On April 30, Cort√©s was wounded and on May 1, the Republicans broke into the sanctuary. Aftermath The remaining rebels were taken prisoner and Cort√©s died of wounds in hospital.Thomas, Hugh.

After the fall of Talavera de la Reina and Toledo in September 1936, the Nationalist troops pushed towards Madrid and in October they were 30 km from the city. The Republican government which had received new Soviet weapons decided to launch a counteroffensive in order to stop the Nationalist offensive at Sese√±a.

London. p.150 On 28 October 1936, the Republican prime minister Largo Caballero decided to launch a counter-offensive with the recently arrived Soviet weapons in order to detain the Nationalists advance towards Madrid. The battle On October 29, 1936, the Spanish Republican Army launched an attack against the Nationalist-held town of Sese√±a. The Republicans attacked with a force of 15 T-26 tanks, armed with a 45mm cannon, led by a Lithuanian tank specialist, Captain Paul Arman, and driven by Soviets with Spanish gunners, and the 1st Mixed Brigade, a newly established mixed brigade led by Enrique L√≠ster. Opposing them, the Nationalists had a force of cavalry led by colonel Monasterio, Moroccan regulares and some Italian tankettes. The Soviet tanks were massed together for a shock attack and entered in Sese√±a. Arman claimed that the Soviet tanks destroyed two infantry battalions, two cavalry squadrons, ten 75 mm guns, two tankettes and 20-30 trucks. The tanks crossed Sese√±a and reached Esquivias, nevertheless, the Mixed Brigade of Lister never entered into the town and the tank force had to retreat.Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War.

The same day, the Republican army, led by Colonel Ildefonso Puigdendolas, launched another assault against the nearby town of Illescas, but the attack was beaten off and Puigdendolas was killed in action.:es:Batalla de Sese√±a Aftermath The attack failed, because the Spanish Republican infantry had no training to operate with tanks, but the Soviet tanks were shown to be effective. According to Thomas, one Soviet tank destroyed 11 Italian tankettes. The same day a squadron of Russian Katiuska bombers attacked Seville.

The Republic has its origins in the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, a colony of the Spanish Empire. The King of Spain appointed a viceroy to oversee the governance of the colony. The 1810 May Revolution deposed the viceregal representative and, along with the Argentine war of independence, started a process to replace the foreign monarchy with an indigenous republican state. All proposals to organize a local monarchy (as in the contemporary Empire of Brazil or the First Mexican Empire) failed, and no local monarch was ever crowned. The national organization saw disputed about the type of relation that Buenos Aires should maintain with the other provinces, either as a centralised government or as a federation. The supporters of each project would wage the Argentine Civil Wars as the Unitarians and Federals. Some provinces of the former viceroyalty (turned first into the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata and then into the Argentine Confederation) tried to secede, some of them remained as independent countries up to modern day (as Bolivia or Paraguay) and others would rejoin Argentina (as the Republic of Entre R√≠os). Two unitarian constitutions were promulgated and then rejected; the definitive one would be the federal Argentine Constitution of 1853, which is still in force. Antecedents The first political event that shaped the future country of Argentina was the creation of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata. So far, the territories in it were neglected provinces of the Viceroyalty of Peru: as the La Plata Basin did not have any precious metals or organized indigenous populations to exploit, all ships commerced with Peru and Mexico instead. The Viceroyalty sought to complement the existing trade routes with new ones, entering South America though the R√≠o de la Plata. The new system would not work as expected, as Spain soon diverted most of its resources to the Napoleonic wars. Trade with the Americas was lowered, and when Britain got a clear naval supremacy with the battle of Trafalgar, it almost ended. The American and French Revolutions gave room to the Age of Enlightenment, a new era of ideas that rejected the absolute monarchies and favored liberalism instead. Spain sought to prevent the expansion of the new ideas across its territories, but many criollos came into contact with them during their university studies, either at the University of Chuquisaca or at Spain itself. Both in Spain and the Americas, people longed for a new type of government, such as a Constitutional monarchy. The ill-fated British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata set a precedent in weakening the monarchic authority. The viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte fled to C√≥rdoba during the conflict, but could not return to Buenos Aires after the liberation: an open cabildo gave Santiago de Liniers (who led the Spanish forces in the conflict) the military authority over the city, while it prepared for a British counter-attack, and ordered Sobremonte to stay out. Liniers would be appointed viceroy later, and this appointment would be confirmed by the Spanish king afterwards. This was the first time that the viceroy was deposed by local institutions, and not by the Spanish king himself. Power vacuum The 1808 Peninsular War was triggered by an event of huge political weight: the king of Spain, Ferdinand VII, was captured and imprisoned by the French armies of Napoleon. The Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom claimed sovereignty, and waged the war against the French. The viceroyalty was then divided in political factions with different political opinions about the legitimacy of the Junta. Conservatives thought that, in political terms, the Junta should be acknowledged as the king would be, and the remainder of the political organization of the Spanish Empire should stay unchanged. A group influenced by the French ideas thought instead that the Junta lacked the king's authority, and each province should be free to appoint their own government Junta. The first one to take this ideas into action was Francisco Javier de El√≠o, governor of the Banda Oriental, with an enmity with viceroy Liniers. El√≠o appointed himself as the head of a Junta in Montevideo, thus acting with autonomy from Liniers. However, he did not declare the independence of the Banda Oriental, nor rejected completely Liniers' authority. He was allied with Mart√≠n de √Ålzaga in Buenos Aires, who organized a mutiny against Liniers. His project was to replace Liniers with a Junta, ruling nominally in the name of Ferdinand VII, and declare independence once Spain was completely invaded by the French forces. The mutiny, however, was defeated by military bodies supporting Liniers, who stayed in power. The failed mutiny increased the power of criollos in the society: the peninsular military bodies, who supported the mutiny, were disbanded, and the only remaining ones were those of criollos. Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, the last viceroy ruling in Buenos Aires. Carlota Joaquina, sister of Ferdinand VII, was the wife of the Portuguese prince regent. As she avoided the capture of the Spanish royal family, she attempted to take charge of the Spanish viceroyalties as regent. This political project, known as Carlotism, was begun in hopes of preventing a French invasion of the Americas. A small secret society of criollos, composed of politicians such as Manuel Belgrano and Juan Jos√© Castelli, and military as Antonio Beruti and Hip√≥lito Vieytes, supported this project. They considered it an opportunity to get a local government instead of a European one, or a step towards a potential declaration of independence. The project was resisted by Viceroy Liniers, most peninsulars, and some criollos, including Mariano Moreno, Juan Jos√© Paso, and Cornelio Saavedra. They suspected that it concealed Portuguese expansionist ambitions over the region. The supporters of Carlota Joaquina intended her to head a constitutional monarchy, whereas she wanted to govern an absolute monarchy; these conflicting goals undermined the project and caused it to fail. Britain, which had a strong influence in the politics of the Portuguese Empire, opposed the project as well: they wanted to prevent Spain from splitting into many kingdoms, and considered Carlota Joaquina unable to prevent this. The disputes between √Ålzaga and Liniers were noticed by the Central Junta, which appointed a new viceroy instead of Liniers: Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros. The criollos resisted his appointment, arguing that Liniers had been confirmed as Viceroy by a Spanish king, whereas Cisneros lacked such legitimacy. Manuel Belgrano urged Liniers to resist against Cisneros, with the support of the loyal military bodies under his command. Liniers, however, rejected the proposal and handed the government to Cisneros without resistance. Javier de El√≠o accepted the authority of the new Viceroy, and dissolved the Junta of Montevideo. Cisneros rearmed the disbanded peninsular militias, and pardoned those responsible for the mutiny. The example of El√≠o and √Ålzaga, however, was soon followed in the Upper Peru. On May 25, 1809, the Chuquisaca Revolution deposed Ram√≥n Garc√≠a de Le√≥n y Pizarro as Governor of Chuquisaca and replaced him with Juan Antonio Alvarez de Arenales. On July 16 the La Paz revolution, led by Colonel Pedro Domingo Murillo, deposed the Governor of La Paz and elected the Junta Tuitiva de los Derechos del Pueblo. La Paz declared itself independent from Spain, but Chiquisaca did not, and did not recognize the Junta Tuitiva. However, both Juntas were immediately defeated by the reactions from Lima and Buenos Aires, and the government returned to its previous state. May Revolution The open cabildo of May 22, a turning point of the May Revolution. The patriots in Buenos Aires finally took action against viceroy Cisneros when a ship from Europe informed that Sevilla had been conquered and the Junta disestablished, only C√°diz and the island of Le√≥n were still standing, but their final defeat seemed imminent. Cisneros tried to conceal the news, but they spread anyway. He proposed then to prevent rushed actions, and suggested to establish a government body with the governors of other Spanish territories, such as Abascal or Nieto. Patriots made secret meetings to discuss the alternatives, and organized a joint plan: the military would deny Cisneros support against riots, on the grounds that his authority ended with the fall of the Junta that appointed him, and the politicians would request an open cabildo to discuss how to face the new scenario. Once securing Cisneros' approval, they organized a demonstration in front of the cabildo, to make sure that Cisneros kept his word, and manipuled the attendance list to the assembly to prevent a similar move by the Cabildo. Thus, the open Cabildo allowed people from lower classes or not recognized as neighbours, contrary to established practices. The open cabildo, celebrated on May 22, discussed the different proposals: to maintain the status quo, to appoint other people to rule with Cisneros, to remove him and appoint a new governor, to appoint a government junta, etc. The dismissal of Cisneros and the appointment of a Junta got the majority of votes. The members of the Junta would be chosen by the Cabildo. However, the Cabildo attempted to thwart the result of the open cabildo, and appointed Cisneros as head of the new Junta. He made the oath of office, but the appointment was seen as a betrayal of the Cabildo, causing huge demonstrations. By the night of May 24, Cisneros resigned, along with the criollo members of the Junta, Saavedra and Castelli. But the following day the Cabildo did not accept Cisneros' resignation, and ordered the military bodies to suppress the demonstrations by force. The military commanders denied such support, and pointed that even if they accepted, their soldiers would mutiny against such orders. The demonstration broke into the Cabildo and overran some sections of it, so the members of the Cabildo finally agreed to accept Cisneros' resignation. The composition of the new Junta came from a document with hundreds of signatures; but who actually proposed the names remains unknown. The Primera Junta was thus the government that replaced Cisneros, ending the authority of the viceroys. Juntas Primera Junta A meeting of the Primera Junta. The Primera Junta was initially resisted by the Cabildo and the Royal Audiencia, still loyal to the absolutist factions, and by other provinces who did not accept its authority. The Royal Audiencia secretly swore allegiance to the Regency Council, a new Junta created in Spain; this was done in defiance to the Primera Junta, who did not accept its authority over the Americas. As a result, the members of the Audiencia were exiled to Spain, along with Cisneros, with the pretext that there was a threat to their lives. Manuel Belgrano would lead a military campaign to Paraguay, and Juan Jos√© Castelli another one to C√≥rdoba and the Upper Peru. The Junta got divided between factions supporting the president Cornelio Saavedra and the secretary Mariano Moreno, who favored moderated and radical reforms respectively. Saavedra prevailed over Moreno by increasing the members of the Junta with the deputies that came from other provinces, which left him in a minority. Moreno resigned, and died during a diplomatic journey to Britain. Junta Grande The Primera Junta, with the new members, was renamed as Junta Grande. It promoted the creation of local Juntas at the other cities, replacing their governors. The departure of Mariano Moreno did not stop the disputes between Morenists and Saavedrists, and Morenists organized an uprising. The military groups loyal to Saavedra, however, knew about it and stop it beforehand, and then requested the removal of all Morenist members of the Junta. The high number of members of the Junta, however, slowed down its work as an executive power. The military defeats of Castelli and Belgrano, and the threat of the royalists at the Banda Oriental, prompted a change in the system of government. The executive power was then held by the First Triumvirate, while the Junta initially stayed as a legislative body, but it was disestablished after conflicting relations with the triumvirate. Triumvirates First triumvirate The Cabildo created a new executive power, the First Triumvirate, composed of three members: Sarratea, Chiclana and Paso. They were all natives of Buenos Aires, with no members from other cities. The Junta Grande, now working as a legislative power, drafted a set of rules for the division of powers, setting the rules, limits and purposes of the Triumvirate (executive), the Junta itself (legislative) and the Royal Audiencia (judiciary). However, this draft was repealed by the Triumvirate, which though that the Junta held too much power. The Junta was disestablished soon afterwards, and the deputies from other cities removed from Buenos Aires. The triumvirate undid the creation of local juntas at the provinces, favoring instead the rule of governors appointed from Buenos Aires. It delayed as well the declaration of independence and the sanction of a constitution. The relation with the provinces shifted to a strong centralism, generating the resistance of Jos√© Gervasio Artigas at the Banda Oriental. Artigas organized the Liga Federal in response, with the Banda Oriental, the mesopotamia, Santa Fe and Cordoba united against Buenos Aires under federalist principles. The former morenists united with Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear and other veterans of the Peninsular War, and with the Lodge of Rational Knights created by them. Together, they organized the Revolution of October 8, 1812, to oust the triumvirate from government. Second triumvirate Once in government, the second triumvirate called for the Assembly of Year XIII, a constituent body with deputies from the other provinces, that would write a national constitution. The Assembly did not claim their sovereignty to be derived from the king, but from the people, in a strong advancement towards popular sovereignty; the mentions to Ferdinand VII were removed from public documents as well. By that time, Ferdinand VII had returned to the throne of Spain, and began the absolutist restoration. The assembly chose the national coat of arms, the national anthem, allowed the use of the modern flag of Argentina as a war flag, and printed money. However, it did not declare independence. The deputies from the Banda Oriental were rejected, increasing the conflicts with Artigas. His deputies had instructions to promote a declaration of independence and promote republicanism and federalism as types of government. The Assembly had initially a higher authority than the triumvirate, but to help in the warfare, it granted it higher power afterwards. In need of an even stronger government, it replaced the triumvirate as executive power with the Supreme Director, a unipersonal office. Independence The Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata replaced the role of the triumvirate. The first one was Gervasio Antonio de Posadas, uncle of Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear, replaced by Alvear himself some time afterwards. Facing an adverse context in the war of independence, Alvear considered turning the United Provinces into a British protectorate, which motivated a coup against him. The Assembly of the Year XIII was closed, but a new one was formed later, the Congress of Tucum√°n. To avoid the animosity against Buenos Aires, it was not located in that city but in Tucum√°n. The Congress did not include deputies from the provinces ruled by Artigas, and included others from provinces which are currently part of Bolivia. The Congress finally declared the independence of the United provinces. There was a plan to move the capital to Cuzco and crown an Inca as king, which was resisted by Buenos Aires. The Congress moved then to Buenos Aires, which could influence them better. The Inca plan was forgotten, and the Congress drafted the 1819 constitution. This constitution did not choose a specific type of government, but the elites in Buenos Aires thought to bring a European prince to Buenos Aires and appoint him king. Estanislao L√≥pez and Francisco Ram√≠rez resisted the project, and attacked Buenos Aires. Neither San Mart√≠n nor Belgrano provided military help. Buenos Aires fell in the battle of Cepeda, which ended the authority of the Supreme Directors. The defeat started the Anarchy of the year XX, a period where the provinces would rule themselves without a national head of state. Anarchy With the defeat of Buenos Aires in Cepeda, the country was left without a head of state. An open cabildo in Buenos Aires elected a new governor, Manuel de Sarratea, who negotiated the Treaty of Pilar with Ram√≠rez and L√≥pez. The treaty guaranteed national unity and a federalist system of government, the end of hostilities between the provinces, and called a new congress to decide a new national government. This congress, however, was never called because of the ongoing wars. The Banda Oriental was invaded by Brazil, but Ram√≠rez and L√≥pez feared that by joining the war their provincies would be invaded as well, so they agreed instead a defense pact with Buenos Aires. This pact would be ratified by the quadrilateral treaty of 1822. During this period, the provinces maintained national unity though treaties, being ruled by caudillos. Buenos Aires lost the authority to appoint governors in the provinces, which increased their autonomies. Santa Fe was the first province to write a provincial constitution. Ram√≠rez proclaimed the independence of the Republic of Entre R√≠os, with the intention to annex Paraguay and Buenos Aires and liberate the Banda Oriental with their combined forces, but this short-lived project ended after his assassination. The province of Corrientes was split from Entre R√≠os after the disestablishment of the proposed state. First presidential attempt Bernardino Rivadavia, first president of Argentina. The Banda oriental, which was renamed by Brazil as Cisplatina, was liberated by the 33 orientals, and joined back the United Provinces. Brazil did not recognize it, leading to the Cisplatine War. It was thought then in Buenos Aires that to wage the war the country should have a proper head of state, so a new congress began to write a constitution for this, which would be enacted in 1826. However, because of the urgency, Bernardino Rivadavia was not appointed president after the promulgation of said constitution, but though a special law creating the office of president. The new constitution was a republican one, defining the existence and function of the three powers. It referenced the country as \\"Argentina\\". Rivadavia and the 1826 constitution found strong resistance from both unitarians and federals. Unitarians did not support the law that turned Buenos Aires into the capital city of Argentina and nationalized its port, as the Buenos Aires province would lose the exclusive benefit from it. Federals did not accept that the president would have the power to appoint provincial governors. His authority was further weakened by the outcome of the war: despite of the military victories, Rivadavia wanted the army to return and protect him from an attack from the other provinces, so he ordered to rush a treaty ending the war. This treaty did not formalize the region as an Argentine province, but as the independent country of Uruguay. Highly rejected, Rivadavia resigned and left to Europe. The 1826 constitution was repealed, and the political organization returned to its previous state. Execution of Dorrego Execution of Manuel Dorrego. With the office of president abolished, the provinces ruled themselves once more. Manuel Dorrego was appointed governor of Buenos Aires. In the lack of a proper head of state, the governor of Buenos Aires received some powers to fill that void, such as managing international relations or paying the foreign debt. Dorrego's rule was short-lived. When the armies returned from the war, they organized a coup against Dorrego, headed by Juan Lavalle. Lavalle captured and executed Dorrego, appointed himself governor of Buenos Aires, closed the legislature, and began a campaign against federals, together with Jos√© Mar√≠a Paz. Lavalle was not recognized as a legitimate governor by the other provinces, and sought the support of Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, who had returned from Europe to aid in the war against Brazil. San Mart√≠n refused to help Lavalle at all, and returned to Europe. The hacendado Juan Manuel de Rosas organized a militia with people from the countryfield to stand against Lavalle, while Estanislao L√≥pez dealt with Paz. Lavalle was defeated by Rosas, who restored the legislature. Juan Jos√© Viamonte was appointed governor, and then Rosas himself. The Federal pact Jos√© Mar√≠a Paz expanded his influence across the northern provinces, creating the Unitarian League. The provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Entre R√≠os signed the Federal Pact in response, and quickly defeated the League by capturing Paz by chance. The Federal Pact was kept for national organization after the unitarian defeat, C√≥rdoba, Santiago del Estero, La Rioja and the provinces of Cuyo joined the Federal Pact in 1831, Catamarca, Tucum√°n and Salta did so the following year. The pact served both as a military alliance (both against non-signing provinces that attacked them, or against other countries) and as a sort of constitution. The Federal Pact had an article declaring that a new constituent assembly should be called to write a constitution as soon as the military threats were defeated. The defeat of Paz and the expansion of the Federal Pact further ushered in a period of economic and political stability. As a result, Federalists were divided between two political trends: those who wanted the calling of such Constituent Assembly, and those who supported Rosas in delaying it. Rosas thought that the best way to organize the Argentine Confederation was as a federation of federated states, similar to the successful States of the United States; each one should write its own local constitution and organize itself, and a national constitution should be written at the end, without being rushed. The time of Rosas Rosas resigned as governor, and moved to the south. The later conflicts between rosist and antirosist federals led to the Revolution of the Restorers, which ousted Juan Ram√≥n Balcarce and replaced him with the rosist Juan Jos√© Viamonte. The Buenos Aires legislature released the sum of public power on Rosas. The weak governments of Balcarce and Viamonte led the legislature to request Rosas to take the government once more. For doing so he requested the sum of public power, which the legislature denied four times. Rosas even resigned as commander of militias to influence the legislature. The context changed with the social commotion generated by the death of Facundo Quiroga, responsibility for which is disputed (different authors attribute it to Estanislao L√≥pez, the Reinaf√© brothers, or Rosas himself). The legislature accepted then to give him the sum of public power. Even so, Rosas requested confirmation on whenever the people agreed with it, so the legislature organized a referendum about it. Every free man within the age of majority living in the city was allowed to vote for \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\": 9.316 votes supported the release of the sum of public power on Rosas, and only 4 rejected it. There are divided opinions on the topic: Domingo Faustino Sarmiento compared Rosas with historical dictators, while Jos√© de San Mart√≠n considered that the situation in the country was so chaotic that a strong authority was needed to create order. Although slavery was not abolished during Rosas' rule, Afro Argentines had a positive image of him. He allowed them to gather in groups related to their African origin, and financed their activities. Troop formations included many of them, because joining the army was one of the ways to become a free negro, and in many cases slave owners were forced to release them to strengthen the armies. There was an army made specifically of free negros, the \\"Fourth Battalion of Active Militia\\". The liberal policy towards slaves generated controversy with neighbouring Brazil, because fugitive Brazilian slaves saw Argentina as a safe haven: they were recognized as free men at the moment they crossed the Argentine borders, and by joining the armies they were protected from persecution of their former masters. The people who opposed Rosas formed a group called Asociacion de Mayo or May Brotherhood. It was a literary group that became politically active and aimed at exposing Rosas' actions. Some of the literature against him includes The Slaughter House, Socialist Dogma, Amalia and Facundo. Meetings which had high attendance at first soon had few members attending out of fear of prosecution. Rosas' opponents during his rule were dissidents, such as Jos√© Mar√≠a Paz, Salvador M. del Carril, Juan Bautista Alberdi, Esteban Echeverria, Bartolom√© Mitre and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. Rosas political opponents were exiled to other countries, such as Uruguay and Chile. The 17 years long rule of Rosas was influenced by permanent warfare, both from unitarians and by other countries. The Peru‚ÄìBolivian Confederation, allied with France, declared the War of the Confederation against Argentina and Chile; France supported it by imposing a naval blockade over Buenos Aires, which was maintained even after the Peru-Bolivian defeat. The French helped Fructuoso Rivera to oust the Uruguayan president Manuel Oribe from power, so that Rivera helped them against Rosas. France gave up the blockade, but Rosas still supported Oribe in the Uruguayan Civil War to reestablish his rule in Uruguay. The conflict against Rivera led to a renewed conflict with France, this time allied with Britain. The Anglo-French blockade of the R√≠o de la Plata was defeated as well. Justo Jos√© de Urquiza, governor of Entre R√≠os, thought by then that it was the time required by the Federal Pact to establish a Constitution, but Rosas still kept his idea of doing it after all provinces had already organized themselves. With the bulk of the army of the Confederation on his side, and some allies, Urquiza defeated both the army of Oribe laying siege to Montevideo and then Rosas himself, in the battle of Caseros. The 1853 Constitution Urquiza united the provinces in the San Nicol√°s Agreement, seeking consensus for the new constitution. The Constituent Assembly met in Santa Fe, and wrote the Argentine Constitution of 1853. The constitution established a Representative, Republican and Federal government. The legislative power was bicameral, and the executive power was held by a president, elected by an electoral college, with a six-years long mandate and with no chance of reelection. The judiciary was accepted as an independent power. The Catholic Church was appointed the official religion of the country, but allowing freedom of religion.

Hendrie, the Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR), reverted to the old Natal Government Railways preference and designed a new Baltic type side-tank steam locomotive. Six of these locomotives were built by Nasmyth, Wilson and Company of Patricroft in Salford, England, and delivered in 1915, numbered in the range from 341 to 346. They were designated Class J and were the first side- tank engines to be acquired by the SAR since Union. Characteristics The engines used saturated steam and had Walschaerts valve gear, piston valves and Belpaire fireboxes. They were designed to work as double-enders on the Natal South Coast line where there was limited engine turning facilities. Service It was soon found, however, that due to their small proportions, they were of insufficient power to handle the rapidly increasing loads on the South Coast. They were therefore taken off the South Coast run and employed as shunting engines in the Durban harbour. Four of them were later allocated to Mossel Bay and the Cape Midland for similar duties. They remained there until they were withdrawn by 1957 after more than forty years in service. The remaining two locomotives, numbers 341 and 342, were sold to gold mines on the Reef. By the early 1970s, no. 341 was still at work on the East Daggafontein Mine as their no. 2. It was later acquired by the South African National Railway And Steam Museum (SANRASM) for preservation.

Artists who cite Grandmaster Caz as an influence include Will Smith, Rakim, Big Daddy Kane, Jay-Z and many more. In 2015, Caz featured on a single by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis named \\"Downtown\\". Sugar Hill Gang controversy A 2009 book claims that the lyrics for The Sugar Hill Gang's seminal \\"Rapper's Delight\\" were plagiarized from the then- unpublished Caz's lyrics. In 2000, he set his account of the controversy in the song \\"MC Delight\\". He claims in the song that he wrote the lyrics of Big Bank Hank (Henry Jackson), who had been the manager of his band, but never received any royalties or thanks for it. Jackson himself substantiated these claims as he neglected to change his verse on \\"Rapper's Delight\\" to reflect his own stage name, instead of beginning his verse with the now famous, \\"Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-A-N, the O-V-A, and the rest is F-L-Y.\\" Casanova Fly is Grandmaster Caz's alternate moniker. This controversy is referenced in episode 3 of part 2 of The Get Down. While listening to Rapper's Delight on the radio, The Get Down Brothers' member, Boo, tells his date that Grandmaster Caz is rapping the line and says that Caz is the \\"nicest MC around\\". Legacy In 1998, Caz was listed #11 out of Blaze Magazine's Top 50 MCs of all Time. He was also inducted into the Technics DJ Hall of Fame in 1999. In June 2008, Grandmaster Caz was inducted into the Bronx Walk of Fame. A street plaque bearing his name is now on permanent display on the Grand Concourse, the most famous thoroughfare in the Bronx. Grandmaster Caz was portrayed by Jaleel White in the Drunk History episode \\"American Music\\".

It was placed in the subgenus Metriatyla by Rowe in 1969 and is the type species of the subgenus. Sandfish are harvested and processed into \\"beche-de-mer\\" and eaten in China and other Pacific coastal communities. Sea cucumbers are marine invertebrates and are closely related to sea urchins and starfish. All these groups tend to have radial symmetry and have a water vascular system that operates by hydrostatic pressure, enabling them to move around by use of many suckers known as tube feet. Sea cucumbers are usually leathery, gherkin-shaped animals with a cluster of feeding tentacles at one end surrounding the mouth.  Anatomy and morphology  The sandfish has the same basic anatomy as most other species of sea cucumber. Their bodies are elongated and cylindric, and relatively stubby. Their dorsal side can range in color from a grey-brown to black, with darkened wrinkles across the body and small black papillae from end to end. They are counter shaded with a lighter ventral side, which is relatively flat. They have a mouth located on the ventral surface at one end of the body, considered the front end. Like other sea cucumbers, they use feeding tentacles which protrude from the mouth. Sandfish have around 20 short tentacles. On the opposite end the anus is found on the dorsal side. They can grow up to an average length of 22 cm with the largest reaching up to 40 cm, and reach maturity around 16 cm or 200 grams with some growing as much as 300 grams in one year. It is unknown how long they live undisturbed, but they can live to at least 10 years. Their gonads are found through a single genital orifice on their dorsal anterior end. Their digestive system is made up of a mouth, an esophagus, a stomach, an intestine, a cloaca, and an anus. They extend respiratory trees from their cloaca in order to breathe. Their body wall is thick, making up a total of 56% of their weight. This body wall is filled with calcareous plates called spicules, and are used to ID species; the sandfish is identified by table and knobbed button shapes. Like other sea cucumbers, they can eviscerate their internal organs if they undergo stress, and can regenerate their organs; in sandfish this takes about 2 months.  Life cycle  The sandfish goes through 6 stages of growth before maturing into an adult. This starts when the adults spawn. After a day the fertilized eggs develop into a first planktonic phase, a gastrula, then after two days it becomes a auricularia, the feeding planktonic stage. Within the next 14 days the sandfish will enter a non-feeding doliolaria stage and a final planktonic pentactula stage, before becoming juveniles and settling into the sea grass meadows to mature.  Ecology  Distribution The species can be found in the Indo-Pacific region, from east Africa to the eastern Pacific. Some have been found in the Persian Gulf, Iran. They are typically restricted to latitudes between 30¬∞ N to 30¬∞ S, due to it being a tropical species.  Habitat  The sandfish inhabits shallow tropical waters, <20 m deep. They prefer seagrass meadows and muddy bottomed substrata with high nutrient levels due to their diet preference. They do have a tolerance for lowered salinity, down to 20 ppt, such as that found in brackish water. Sandfish play a key role in the health of their habitat; like most sea cucumbers H. scabra are bioturbators and play a key role in reworking the sediment and ensuring that organic matter is evenly distributed for the ecosystem to function, and have a subsequent diet of detritus and other microorganisms.  Behavior  The sandfish exhibits some distinct behaviors. Their burrowing behavior varies as they mature, with younger sandfish responding to changes in light and coming out in darkness. Older sandfish are more sensitive to changes in temperature and will burrow to escape the cold. Sandfish are particular about sediment size and type, settling in fine sand and muddy substrates high in nutrients. Like all sea cumbers, H. scabra exhibits defensive vomiting, where they expel their internal organs to distract predators while they escape. Male and females have distinct mating behaviors; when they spawn males erect their bodies and sway from side to side as they release sperm into the surrounding water. Shortly after, females will erect their bodies and send eggs into the water with the sperm in a short, forceful burst. Uses The sandfish has been eaten by man for over 1000 years. About twenty other species of sea cucumber are also consumed but the sandfish is the species most often used. In the 1990s it was being sold dried as beche-de-mer for up to US$100 per kilogram.The Sea Cucumber Holothuria scabra (Holothuroidea, Echinodermata): Its Biology and Exploitation as Beche- de-mer. Harvesting sandfish from the sea is known as trepanging in Indonesia. In many areas the fisheries have declined over the years because of over fishing, so ranching, aquaculture and hatchery rearing are being attempted.  Aquaculture  Sandfish hatchery at Alaminos, Pangasinan The Philippine \\"Balatan\\", or sea cucumber breeding/harvesting The sandfish has a high value in Asian markets where they are sold as beche-de-mer for food. This makes them a key species for aquaculture production, where the species flourishes; one of the only tropical holothurian species to do so. They are also valuable in aquaculture for habitat restocking; juveniles are often grown in tanks and released into the wild with hopes of restocking the wild population and causing a spillover effect in protected areas. Broodstock is the population of adults that will be used for reproduction. These are gathered from wild stocks and since the sandfish is found in environments close to the equator, they can spawn year round. Peak season for spawning though is typically during the dry seasons, August to November. Approximately 30‚Äì45 adult sandfish are required to start a small batch of spawning individuals. Spawning for H. scabra is closely related to the lunar cycle, and will occur in the afternoon to early evening. Spawning can be induced using several methods: thermal stimulation involves increasing and decreasing water temperatures rapidly, dry treatment involves leaving the sandfish out of the water for 30‚Äì45 minutes before being returned to the tanks, and the food stimulant method involves providing a highly concentrated amount of algae to the water to overfeed the sandfish. Gonad extraction is also an option but requires the dissection of the animal. It is common in most aquaculture facilities to use a combination of the listed methods, in order to ensure spawning. The sandfish larvae are closely monitored in order to ensure survival, as they are temperamental and require specific conditions for success. Once the larvae develop into juveniles they must be moved into growout tanks, at a density of 200-500 individuals per square meter to ensure that each one is receiving proper space to grow and the required nutrients.  Cocultures  Due to its hardy nature, the sandfish is a good species for cocultures with other species. They are able to reuse waste material from other organisms and make nutrients usable. The following species have been kept in tanks with H. scabra: * Black tiger prawn, Penaeus monodonR. Pitt, N.D.Q. Duy, T.V. Duy, H.T.C. Long Sandfish (Holothuria scabra) with shrimp (Penaeus monodon) co-culture tank trials Beche-de-mer (2004), pp. 12-22 * Red seaweed, Kappaphycus striatum * Blue shrimp, Litopenaeus stylirostris Parasites The worm pearlfish (Encheliophis vermicularis) is a parasite of this species and each parasitised H. scabra will host a male and female pair of the fish which live inside its body.  Conservation status  The sandfish is listed as an endangered with populations declining by the IUCN Red List. They face threats from over harvesting, but efforts are currently being taken around the Indo-Pacific including bans on the fishery and restocking via aquaculture efforts.

Career The elder sister of actress Grete Weixler, Dorrit first appeared in silent film shorts for director Alwin Neu√ü (1879‚Äì1935) in 1911. In 1913 she began a successful collaboration with film director Franz Hofer at Luna Film.Franz Hofer . Filmportal.de. Retrieved on 8 October 2015. Hofer began casting Weixler in a number of comedies presenting her as a comedic, temperamental, independent-minded but endearing teenager, often replete in her soon-to-be signature sailor outfit.Hans-Michael Bock, Tim Bergfelder: The Concise Cinegraph: Encyclopaedia of German Cinema, page 224. Berghahn Books, 2009. She often appeared opposite popular German actor and director Ernst Lubitsch and matinee idol Bruno Kastner in her early films with Hofer.Dorrit Weixler . Cyranos.ch. Retrieved on 8 October 2015. Weixler made approximately eleven films with Hofer, and her role as a brassy teen became popular with German filmgoers. In 1915 Weixler moved to Oliver Film, but her image was not tampered with significantly. A number of \\"Dorrit\\" films were released from 1915 to 1916 which followed her adventures, such as: Dorrit's Chauffeur (1915), Dorrits Ehegl√ºck (English: Dorrit's Marital Bliss) (1916) and Dorrit bekommt 'ne Lebensstellung (Dorrit Gets a Job for Life) (1916) for directors such as Paul Otto and Paul Heidemann. Death During the end of May 1916, Weixler was at a theater in Nollendorfplatz as part of a \\"Dorrit Weixler Week\\"; a promotional campaign for the actress. It was Weixler's first time performing on stage. The audience at the theater was full and Weixler was to entertain the crowd with comedic sketches and dancing. During a dance routine, Weixler collapsed on stage and the show had to be closed. Various speculations were cast by the press for her ailment, including stress or a neurological disorder. The filming of a new movie had to be aborted because of her poor health after her collapse. Later that year Weixler was given morphine, to which she became addicted. She was placed in a sanatorium in Berlin for rest and recovery. On 30 November 1916, aged 24, she committed suicide by hanging herself. She was buried at the S√ºdwestkirchhof cemetery in Stahnsdorf in December of that year. In 1921, five years after her death, Dorittchens Vergn√ºgungsreise (Dorritchen's Pleasure Cruise) was released to the German public. Filmed in 1916, the film was directed by Paul Heidemann, and Weixler appeared opposite actors Bruno Kastner and Kurt Busch.

After defeating a Russian force at the Battle of Valkeala the Swedish and Russian forces became entangled in a series of manoeuvres and skirmishes in the area near Keltis and Valkeala. A Swedish force of 800 men that had been left at the village of Nappa near Keltis came under attack by a 2,500 strong Russian force commanded by General Backman. The Swedes retreated in an orderly fashion and were soon reinforced when General Vilhelm Mauritz Pauli arrived with 1,200 men. Meanwhile, the Russian force halted and positioned itself at the Keltis barracks, originally built as a Swedish guardpost, where it also received some reinforcements. With his 2,000 man force General Pauli felt confident enough to launch a counterattack against the Russians and marched in the evening of May 19 against Keltis barracks. During the night of May 19‚Äì20 the Swedes attacked and after a short but bloody battle the surprised and shaken Russians retreated. Left behind on the battlefield were 200 dead Russians.

It is sponsored by thirteen western state credit union leagues of the Credit Union National Association (CUNA) and in cooperation with Pomona College in Claremont, CA. The school was established in June 1959 to serve credit union professionals located within the District Four of CUNA. The founding committee that oversaw the schools operation were Carl A. Bowman, Charles R. Stark, Robert W. Wells, Dwight J. Brohard, then Director of Education of the California Credit Union League, Charles M. Clark, as school director, John Clevenger and John Bigger. Clarence Murphy served as an ex officio member. History In 1958, the Board of Directors of the California Credit Union League (CCUL) instructed Clarence Murphy, the league‚Äôs managing director, to explore the possibility of forming a school patterned after the Credit Union National Association (CUNA) school at the University of Wisconsin. The school was to serve credit unions within the District Four of CUNA. Carl A. Bowman and Charles R. Stark led in organizing the CUNA District 4 School for Credit Union Personnel. A committee was also formed to oversee the operation of the school. The committee then selected to partner with the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and the school opened in August 12, 1960 with the first batch of 42 students who were to become the class of 1962. In the latter part of the 1960s the school started its search for a new partner institution. On August 14, 1972 the school held its first classes at its new and current home at Pomona College in Claremont, California. According to Dr. James Likens, the strained relationship between the school and UCLA, mainly due to lack of continuity of faculty coordinators from UCLA and unwillingness to provide the educational program needed for the school to succeed, forced the school to look for another location.Western CUNA Management School, 2005 This is in contrast to how Charles Clark attributed to UCLA for having excellent coordinators that contributed to Western CUNA Management School's fine reputation.Western CUNA Management School, 1979 The school changed its name in 1980 to the Western Regional CUNA School to reflect the fact that the school is no longer in the district four of CUNA, but now district nine. In 1981, the school changed its name again to Western CUNA Management School to better reflect the 13 Western States that it serves and how the program has become a ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù program rather than a school for credit union personnel. Greek alphabet class names The first year class of 1981 was one of the largest in the school‚Äôs history. The school‚Äôs curriculum at the time made it necessary to divide the class into two sections and they were named ‚ÄúAlpha‚Äù and ‚ÄúBeta‚Äù. This started the tradition of naming each class after a letter of the Greek alphabet. Once all the letters of the Greek alphabet is used the next class is again called ‚ÄúAlpha‚Äù. The second batch of ‚ÄúAlpha‚Äù class graduated in 2003.

She is best known for her appearances in various Hindi and Marathi films directed by her husband V. Shantaram, in 1950s-1960s, most notably Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje (1955), Do Aankhen Barah Haath (1958), Navrang (1959), Marathi film Pinjra (1972) and Amar Bhoopali (1951). Career Sandhya was discovered by V. Shantaram when he was seeking new faces to cast for his film Amar Bhoopali (1951). The young woman did not have outstanding features or talent, but what struck the filmmaker was that she had a good voice, one that strangely resembled that of his second wife, the actress Jayshree. She later married him after Jayshree left him. In 1952, Sandhya debuted as an actress in his Marathi film Amar Bhoopali in the role of a vocalist, the object of poet Honaji Bala's desire. She went on to feature in most of Shantaram's films. In her next film Teen Batti Char Raasta (1953), she played an impoverished girl named Kokila who is considered unattractive because of her dark skin, but who is secretly a radio star with a beautiful singing voice. Like her name, she resembled the black bird koel which sings beautifully. For the role, Sandhya wore dark makeup. As she had no formal dance training, she underwent intensive instruction in classical dance from co-star Gopi Krishna for the film Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje. The two play Kathak dancers who are preparing for an important competition, but face opposition from their dance guru when they fall in love. The film was very successful and went on to win four Filmfare Awards as well as the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. Sandhya starred opposite her husband in the film Do Aankhen Barah Haath, where she played Champa, a toy seller who fascinates the warden and inmates as she walks outside their jail. In Navrang, she played the plain wife of the titular character, a poet, who creates a fantasy image of her as his beautiful and sensuous muse. The film contained the Holi song \\"Arre Ja Re Hatt Natkhat\\", where Sandhya dances with an elephant wearing dancing bells ghungroo. She next starred in Stree (1961), a film version of Shakuntala's story from the Mahabharata. As the epic mentions that Shakuntala and her son Bharata lived in the wilderness among lions, Shantaram decided to include real lions in some scenes. Sandhya did not have a double for these scenes; she prepared by shadowing a lion tamer and practicing in the cage with the lions. Sandhya's last major role was in the Marathi version of Pinjra; her character is that of a tamasha artiste who falls in love with a school teacher out to reform her, played by Shriram Lagoo in his film debut. In 2009, she made a special appearance at the V. Shantaram Awards ceremony to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Navrang.

The trawlers were protecting the transport ship Galdames, which was sailing to Bilbao with 173 passengers.  Prelude  On 4 March, four armed trawlers of the Basque Auxiliary Navy section of the Spanish Republican Navy, Bizcaya, Gipuzkoa, Donostia and Nabarra departed from Bayonne, France. Their intention was to defend Galdamess mail, passengers, machinery, weapons, supplies and 500 tons of nickel coins property of the Basque government. Canarias sailed from Ferrol with Salvador Moreno as the captain, with orders to stop the transport ship. Galdames, which was steaming up with the lights and the radio switched off, was outrun by Bizcaya and Gipuzkoa. Next morning, while all the trawlers were watching for Canarias, Galdames rejoined them. Bizcayas captain was Alejo Bilbao, Nabarras Enrique Moreno Plaza from Murcia, Gipuzkoas Manuel Gald√≥s, and Donostia's Francisco Elortegi. The trawlers had the intention of luring Canarias close to the Biscay coast to have the assistance of the coastal batteries.Los bacaladeros vascos y el combate del Cabo Machichaco  Engagement  The first trawler to spot Canarias was Gipuzkoa, north of Bilbao. The Basque trawler was hit on the bridge and the forward gun. Return fire from Gipuzkoa killed one Canarias seaman and wounded another. The armed trawler, with five fatalities and 20 injured aboard, managed to approach the coast, where the shore batteries forced Canarias to retreat. Nabarra and Donostia tried to prevent Canarias from finding Galdames and engaged the cruiser. Donostia withdrew from the battle after being fired on by Canarias, but Nabarra faced the enemy for almost two hours. She was eventually hit in the boiler and came to a stop; 20 men abandoned the sinking trawler, while other 29 were lost with the ship, including her captain, Enrique Moreno Plaza.El Combate naval de Cabo Machichaco The transport Galdames, which was hit by a salvo from Canarias and lost four passengers, was eventually captured by the Nationalist cruiser. Gipuzkoa arrived at Portugalete seriously damaged and Bizcaya headed for Bermeo, where she assisted the Estonian merchantman Yorbrook with a load including ammunition and 42 Japanese Type 31 75 mm mountain guns, previously captured by Canarias and released. Donostia sought shelter in a French port.  Aftermath  The 20 survivors from Nabarra were rescued by the Nationalists and taken aboard Canarias. Instead of the expected hostility and mistreatment, they were given medical assistance, and both the cruiser commander, future Francoist Admiral Salvador Moreno and Captain Manuel Calder√≥n interceded with Franco when the Basque seamen were sentenced to death in retaliation for the shooting of two crewmembers of the armed trawler Virgen del Carmen, captured by Republican sympathizers and diverted to Bilbao in December 1936. The survivors were eventually acquitted and released in 1938. In contrast, one of the passengers aboard Galdames, Christian Democrat politician Manuel Carrasco Formiguera, from Catalonia, was imprisoned and executed on 9 April 1938.

On 31 March 1937 the Nationalists started their offensive against the Republican held province of Biscay. As part of the offensive the Aviazione Legionaria and the Legion Condor bombed Durango, a town of 10,000 inhabitants that was also a key road and railway junction behind the frontline. Around 250 people are believed to have died in the bombing. Background On 31 March 1937, the Nationalist forces, led by Emilio Mola, started the offensive against the Republican held, Vizcaya Province. Mola said that: \\"I have decided to terminate rapidly the war in the north: those not guilty of assassinations and who surrender their arms will have their lives and property spared. But, if submission is not immediate, I will raze all Vizcaya to the ground, beginning with the industries of war\\". The same day the Nationalists bombed the towns of Durango and Elorrio. The bombing Durango, a town of 10,000 inhabitants, was a road and railway junction between Bilbao and the front. By bombing the road and infrastructure in the town, the Republican forces would be prevented from sending reinforcements from Bilbao. It would also ensure that the Basque and Republican troops couldn't retreat in an orderly fashion in order to fight another day. Despite the importance of Durango as a transportation junction, the town had no air defences, and there were only a few Republican fighter planes to be found in the Basque region. On 31 March, German and Italian transport planes modified to carry bombs (German Ju 52 and Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.81) from the Condor Legion and the Aviazione Legionaria bombed the town in relays. Two churches were bombed during the celebration of mass, killing 14 nuns and the officiated priest. Furthermore, Heinkel He 51 fighters strafed fleeing civilians. Altogether, around 250 civilians (Thomas: 248; Beevor: 250 and Preston: 258) died in the attack. Aftermath On 28 April, Durango fell to Nationalist side. While the local road junction meant that Durango was a legitimate target for an air attack and the bombing did not contravene the laws of war as they were at the time, foreign observers were shocked at the carnage. The Nationalists denied responsibility for the bombing, claiming that the priest and the nuns who died in the bombing were killed and burned by the reds. Queipo de llano said that: \\"our planes bombed military objectives in Durango, and later communists and socialists locked up the priests and nuns, shooting without pity and burning the churches\\". The bombing of Durango was to a certain extent overlooked historically. Instead, it was the bombing of Guernica, a similar air attack that took place four weeks later, that came to symbolize the horrors of modern aerial warfare in the public consciousness.

Life He was born in London on 20 January 1815. He went to a private school, and was articled at the age of fifteen as an architect and surveyor; but went on to support himself by teaching, chiefly mathematical, privately and at a school. He then attended University College, London. In 1841 he graduated B.A. in the University of London. In 1846 he became assistant to George Fownes, professor of practical chemistry at University College, and occupied this post, after Fownes's death in 1849, until 1857, under Professor Alexander William Williamson. Having an impediment in speech he found himself unable to obtain a professorship, and worked on the literature of chemistry. In 1847 he was elected fellow of the Chemical Society. On 17 December 1849 he was elected editor of the Chemical Society's Journal, and about the beginning of 1860 he also became librarian to the society. Early in 1871 it was decided to print in the society's journal abstracts of all papers on chemistry appearing elsewhere. In February 1871 a committee was appointed to superintend the publication of the journal and these summaries, but soon the abstracts were left entirely to Watts. In 1866 Watts was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1879 he was elected Fellow of the Physical Society. He was an honorary member of the Pharmaceutical Society and life-governor of University College, London. He died on 30 June 1884. He had married in 1854 Sophie, daughter of Henri Hanhart, of M√ºlhausen in Alsace, by whom he had eight sons and two daughters. Works In 1848 he was engaged by the Cavendish Society to translate into English and enlarge Leopold Gmelin's classic Handbuch der Chemie, a work which occupied much of his time till 1872, when the last of its eighteen volumes appeared. In 1863-67 he was co-author with Thomas Richardson of the last three volumes of the second edition of Chemical Technology, written by Friedrich Ludwig Knapp, Edmund Ronalds and Richardson. In 1858 he was engaged by Messrs. Longmans & Co. to prepare a new edition of the Dictionary of Chemistry and Mineralogy of Andrew Ure; but the book was obsolete, and he transformed it, with the help of a staff, into an encyclop√¶dia of chemical science. The first edition of Watts's Dictionary of Chemistry, in five volumes, was completed in 1868; supplements were published in 1872, 1875, and 1879‚Äì81. A new edition, revised and entirely rewritten by M. M. Pattison Muir and Henry Forster Morley, was published 1888‚Äì94, 4 vols.

Marc-Antoine-Nicolas de Croismare, Marquis of Lasson (Normandy, 1694 ‚Äì 3 August 1772, parish of Saint-Roch in Paris), was a French dilettante, mostly known for having inspired The Nun to Denis Diderot. He also was depicted as \\"M. le Marquis de Roquemaure\\" by Italian economist Ferdinando Galiani, in his Dialogues sur les commerce des bl√©s (1770). Croismare was descended from an old noble family of Normandy, well established at the royal court, the son of Fran√ßois-Nicolas, Lord of Botoirs and La Plesse, and Elizabeth de Croismare, heir to the branch of the lords of La Pineli√®re and Lasson, a descendant of Nicolas Croixmare. In his youth, the Marquis served as a captain in the infantry regiment of the King, where his brother Louis-Eugene has long been lieutenant-colonel. Uninterested in securing the higher ranks, he left the service after receiving the cross of St. Louis. The archetype of the amicable Frenchman, the marquis of Croismare earned the nickname \\"The Philosopher\\" for giving up ambition early in life. Alternatively, very devout, strong-minded or indifferent, he fell in love with a Protestant girl of his countryside, Suzanne Davy de La Pailleterie.Alexandre Dumas, born \\"Thomas Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie\\", is related to her. His fervor for the Catholic religion was such that he made Suzanne La Pailleterie his proselyte. Her conversion, effected on 30 October 1734 at Cagny, is perhaps the only one he achieved. After his marriage, on 3 August 1735, she gave him two sons and a daughter. Having lost her early, he nearly died of grief. After his wife's death, he left his land of Lasson, near Caen, for Paris. Soon after, he was sought after by the best company. He had left his devotion behind in Normandy, and the company of Fontenelle, Mairan, Mirabaud, D'Alembert, Diderot certainly inspired him to keep things this way. In 1759, his business recalled him in Normandy for a few months. Instead, he remained there for nearly eight years. Keen to lure him back to the capital, Diderot and his friends plotted a ruse inspired by the true story of a nun named Marguerite Delamarre who had appealed her vows: they pretended that nun had escaped the convent and was addressing the Marquis to seek his help. The ploy to bring the Marquis back to Paris failed when, instead of returning to Paris, the Marquis offered asylum to the imaginary nun in his home in Normandy. French literature gained one of its most poignant novels. Croismare finally returned to Paris in 1767, having lost none of his gaiety, playfulness and grace, which held true until company where his death.

It produced 16 cycle-car style vehicles between 1951 and 1954.  The name  The company was established by a Parisian called Robert Hannoyer. Its name was the ananym of its founder's name.  The product  The only model was a small four-wheeled vehicle with a relatively wide track at the front and a narrow track at the rear. The vehicle offered space for two, seated one behind the other, following the same basic lay-out as the better known Messerschmitt ‚ÄúBubble-car‚Äù. Weather protection came from a hood which could be partially opened to expose only the driver to the weather (in a style dubbed \\"a la Milord\\" by at least one commentator) or fully folded back if the passenger in the back also wished to travel roofless. A single-cylinder engine from AMC or Ydral of 175 cc or 125 cc powered the rear axle via a three speed manual gear box and a chain drive mechanism. An unusual feature of the front wheels was that when parked their supporting structure could be folded towards the centre of the car so that the parked vehicles had a curiously raised nose but a front track (corresponding in this case with the vehicle's overall width) of only 750 mm, enabling it to park in a space little wider than a motorbike slot. For travelling, the front wheels had to be folded out, increasing the front track to a more stable 1320 mm.  Performance  Hannoyer's enthusiasm kept his small car alive and appearing at the Paris Motor Show for at least three years from 1950 till 1952 during which the car failed to attract customers in the numbers for which he had hoped. Five days after the salon doors closed in October 1952 he took a special light-weight Reyonnah 175 to the Montlh√©ry circuit of which he had previously made a study.

At the request of Reginald, John takes a lady customer (Lazzarini) out to look at the boy's ranch property. John and the woman are held up on the road when their machine breaks down. Meanwhile, Constance, who sees herself as a misunderstood wife, has been devoting her time to writing scenarios for motion pictures. She meets Reginald and insists that he play the part of the lover Orlando in her movie script. Jay then starts for the city in his automobile when he sees John and the lady customer coming out of a notorious roadhouse. Reginald is shocked, but John explains that they had merely entered the place for shelter during a rain storm. John discharges his chauffeur and Jay drives him back to the Inn. To complicate matters for John, the discharged chauffeur tells Constance that John was in the roadhouse with a strange woman, whereupon Constance decides to obtain a divorce. New staying in the city, John, aware that Reginald will be called as a witness since he has been served with a subpoena, induces Reginald to pretend that he is ill, and has hired two quack doctors, Drs. Macklyn (Geldart) and Widner (Littlefield), to carry out the scheme. The beautiful Nurse Durant (Daniels) is also hired, and Reginald quickly falls in love with her. Constance obtains Reginald's temperature chart and obtains an order of the court for his examination by a neutral physician. When he realizes his nurse has been fired, Reginald jumps out of bed in pursuit of her. He finds her and brings her back. Just before the neutral physician examines him, Nurse Durant kisses Reginald, and Dr. Flexner (Bolder) finds that Reginald's heart action registers badly. Constance, realizing that she has lost her Orlando, makes up her mind to retain her husband and asks his forgiveness. The two quack doctors then leave the place while the going is good.

In the Harleian MSS. there is an account of his voyage after the great treasure at Puerto Rico, when he was general of Queen Elizabeth's Indian armada. He was sent with Lord Willoughby to France to assist Henry IV in 1589. He was Member of Parliament for Carmarthen borough in 1592. Subsequently he commanded the troops despatched to Brittany (1594). He then took part in an expedition to the Spanish Main in 1595 under the command of Francis Drake.

In January 1596 an attempt to cross the isthmus of Panama from Nombre de Dios in order to seize the silver rich port of Portobelo, Col√≥n also ended in failure.

J. Walker (born 1947) is a Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Victoria, Canada, and PUC-Rio. He is the founding co-editor, with Didier Bigo, of the journal International Political Sociology, and long-term editor of the journal Alternatives: Global, Local, Political. With his colleague Warren Magnusson, he is a founding member of UVIC's interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Cultural, Social and Political Thought. His work, while critical of International Relations and Political Theory disciplines, addresses a broad range of problematics bound up with practices and theories of spatiotemporality, boundaries, and sovereignties. Borders/Boundaries Walker has written extensively on the logic of 'inside/outside,' a dichotomy which enables and frames International Relations and its theorizations.Nick Vaughan-Williams. (2009) Border Politics: The Limits of Sovereign Power. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. For Walker, border practices and boundary discourses, spatial demarcations and conceptualizations of here/there and us/them, operate as important sites for understanding these 'inside/outside' logics. Vaughan-Williams, assessing the study of borders within International Relations disciplines, praises Walker's work for \\"offering the most sustained engagement with the problem of borders, especially the relationship between the concept of the border of the state and sovereignty, at the intersection of IR and political theory.\\"Ibid., 51. State Sovereignty Perhaps Walker's largest body of work is on the topic of State Sovereignty. Because modern theories of International Relations were created in a time when state sovereignty was a given cornerstone of political theorizing, modernist theorists continue this trend, despite it becoming increasingly less apparent. Though Walker denies Cosmopolitanism and the assumption that state sovereignty will eventually be a thing of the past, he stresses the importance of Modern theorists to acknowledge the decline of a states ability to act autonomously within its own fixed borders. The European Union is an excellent example of states that are slowly losing sovereignty in a way many traditional IR theorists fail to realize.Walker, RBJ (1993) \\"Inside/Outside: International Relations as Political Theory\\", Cambridge University Press, p. 159-179 Political Theory One of Walker's biggest contributions to International Relations discourse is his analysis of theories. Walker rejects the dichotomy between theory and practice, where epistemology is favoured over ontology. Practice is \\"Theory-laden\\", inseparable, and a different theoretical approach will reveal different practical outcomes.Walker, RBJ (1993) \\"Inside/Outside: International Relations as Political Theory\\", Cambridge University Press, p. 8 It is no small wonder that Walker describes Realism and its tenancies (often afflicted by a negative perception of mankind) in a negative light:\\"As it informs a rather large and influential literature on geopolitics and military affairs, realism has often degenerated into little more than an antipolitical apology for cynicism and physical force.\\"Walker, RBJ (1987) \\"Realism, Change and International Political Theory\\", International Studies Quarterly31, 1: 65-86 For Walker, the use of such a theory leads to increasingly negative and cynical practice. Postmodernism Walker is often cited as being a postmodernist thinker,Woods, T. (1999) \\"Beginning postmodernism\\", Manchester: Manchester University Press, p. 250Griffiths, M et al (1999) \\"Fifty Key Thinkers in International Relations\\", New York: Routledge p. 274 bringing postmodernism into the eye of scholars alongside Richard Ashley.Gibbs, D. (2000) \\"Is There Room for the Real World in the Postmodernist Universe?\\" p. 6 Despite countless theorists and scholars saying otherwise, Walker himself does not claim to be a postmodernist, but rather rejects this principal. Walker, being more concerned with theories themselves and the spatial-temporal factors of their creation, sees postmodernism not as theory separate from modern theories, but simply a product of its own inception. In this sense postmodernism is not the answer to modernism, but the continuation thereof.Walker, RBJ (1993) Inside/Outside: International Relations as Political Theory, Cambridge University Press, p. 10 Bibliography * Inside/Outside: International Relations as Political Theory (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993). * One World, Many Worlds: Struggles For A Just World Peace (Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner; London: Zed Books, 1988). * Out of Line: Boundaries, Borders, Limits (London: Routledge, forthcoming July 2015). * Europe‚Äôs 21st Century Challenge (London: Ashgate, in press for 2010).

FI6 is the only known antibody found to bind all 16 subtypes of the influenza A virus hemagglutinin and is hoped to be useful for a universal influenza virus therapy. The antibody binds to the F domain HA trimer, and prevents the virus from attaching to the host cell. The antibody has been refined in order to remove any excess, unstable mutations that could negatively affect its neutralising ability, and this new version of the antibody has been termed \\"FI6v3\\" Research Researchers from Britain and Switzerland have previously found antibodies that work in Group 1 influenza A viruses or against most Group 2 viruses (CR8020), but not against both. This team developed a method using single-cell screening to test very large numbers of human plasma cells, to increase their odds of finding an antibody even if it was extremely rare. When they identified FI6, they injected it into mice and ferrets and found that it protected the animals against infection by either a Group 1 or Group 2 influenza A virus. Scientists screened 104,000 peripheral-blood plasma cells from eight recently infected or vaccinated donors for antibodies that recognize each of three diverse influenza strains: H1N1 (swine-origin) and H5N1 and H7N7 (highly pathogenic avian influenzas.) From one donor, they isolated four plasma cells that produced an identical antibody, which they called FI6. This antibody binds all 16 HA subtypes, neutralizes infection, and protects mice and ferrets from lethal infection. The most broadly reactive antibodies that had previously been discovered recognized either one group of HA subtypes or the other, highlighting how remarkable FI6 is in its ability to target the gamut of influenza subtypes. Clinical implication Researchers determined the crystal structure of the FI6 antibody when it was bound to H1 and H3 HA proteins. Sitting atop the HA spike is a globular head domain that binds to cellular receptors during viral entry and contains the major antigenic sites targeted by the immune system. Because of this selective pressure, the sequence in the head domain drifts enough to require an updated seasonal vaccine most years. A stalk domain connects the head to the viral membrane and is responsible for fusing viral and host membranes so that the pathogen can invade human cells. The immune system usually does not have a strong response to the partially hidden stalk domain, so portions of the stalk remain highly conserved across all influenza subtypes. The FI6 antibody makes extensive contacts with conserved parts of the stalk, thereby blocking HA from harpooning a sticky fusion peptide into the host membrane during viral entry. The FI6 provides scientists with a broadly neutralizing antibody that recognizes all 16 HA subtypes, including emerging ones, such as H5N1. But, because the replication of the influenza virus is somewhat error-prone, the virus evolves as a quasispecies, and widespread use of antiviral drugs can lead to resistant strains. Such has been the case for oseltamivir and for the M2 ion channel blocker amantadine. Therefore, before considering FI6 as long-term prophylactic or therapeutic agent against seasonal influenza, we would first have to determine whether the influenza virus could quickly mutate the epitope targeted by FI6 and escape recognition by FI6 after exposure. A more important clinical implication of this work is the identification of a universal neutralizing epitope in the HA stalk at the atomic level an important intellectual landmark for the development of a universal influenza vaccine. In the absence of the immunodominant head domain, isolated portions of the HA stalk that include the FI6 epitope and have already been shown to stimulate broad, but not universal, protective effects against H1N1 and H3N2 strains in vaccinated animals. Using protein engineering and adjuvants to focus the immune system on the FI6 epitope may be the critical next step along the path to a universal vaccine.

Life The son of an Episcopalian clergyman, he was born at Brechin, Forfarshire, in 1708. He was educated at Aberdeen University with a view to becoming a parochial schoolmaster, but he settled in London in 1730, and tried literature. He was first engaged on parliamentary debates for the Gentleman's Magazine, his reports being revised by Samuel Johnson. He gradually made a reputation as a political writer, and in 1745 received a pension of ¬£200 a year from the Pelham administration. He asked for and was granted a renewal of his pension by the Bute government in 1762. Guthrie was referred to by Johnson in terms of some respect. He died on 9 March 1770, and was buried in Marylebone. Works Guthrie's first scholarly work was a History of England from the Invasion of Julius C√¶sar to 1688, 4 vols., Lond. 1744‚Äì51; an attempt to base history on parliamentary records. In 1763 he published a book titled Complete List of the English Peerage. In spite of revision by aristocrats, this work is inaccurate. About 1764‚Äì7 he published, along with collaborators, A General History of the World, from the Creation to the Present Time, in twelve volumes; this was favourably noticed in The Critical Review, it was said by the author himself. In 1767 appeared A General History of Scotland in 10 volumes. It is inaccurate, particularly in the early periods.http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11792?docPos=4 Probably his most noted book was his Geographical, Historical, and Commercial Grammar (1770), which reached numerous editions, and was translated into French in 1801. Besides translations from Quintilian (1756) and Cicero (1744‚Äì54‚Äì55‚Äì58), he also wrote The Friends, a sentimental novel, in two volumes (1754), and Remarks on English Tragedy (1757).

At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, the company played a leading role in the development of injector pumps in Germany and Europe. K√∂rting still produces pump and pump-based vacuum technology, but also industrial burners and machinery related to thermal and chemical purification/transformation processes.  History  The K√∂rting Brothers company was founded in Hanover on 1 November 1871 by the brothers Berthold and Ernst K√∂rting. The brothers rented a small office a small space in the backyard of the present day 13 Joachimstrasse near Hanover Central Station. Berthold took charge of the commercial side, while Ernst specialized in the technical side. The brothers started successfully with the development and patenting of one of the first functioning injectors. In the beginning, only two workmen were employed. Due to the ever-increasing orders, in 1872 the company rented a factory on Celler street in what is now the Oststadt district. It consisted of two small buildings with a 12 horse-power steam engine. It would employ 41 workers. The young enterprise produced injectors and jet-pumps as well as the associated condensers. In 1874 the small factory was already supplying 2,000 devices. The enterprise grew quickly, and in a few years established proxies in Germany and neighboring European lands (London, Paris, Milan, Genoa, Barcelona, Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw), St. Petersburg, Vienna) and overseas (Philadelphia). The first foreign branch came into being as \\"K√∂rthing Brothers\\" in Manchester. The American branch was opened in 1874. In 1880 the company had 20 staff and 170 workers. The product line was expanded to central heaters, gas scrubbers, gas-, gasoline-, and Diesel-motors. K√∂rting vacuum brakes could be found in many trains of the time. In 1920, K√∂rting also built the first Holzwarth-Gas Turbine. In 1889, a new, larger factory with a large foundry and a powerhouse, would be erected in Linden, where the firm's headquarters has been to this day. A workers‚Äô town with a school was built in the direct vicinity, the so- called \\"K√∂rtingsdorf\\". At its peak before the Great Depression, K√∂rting employed approximately 1,700 workers and 400 staff. The company was one of the biggest employers in the Hanover region. In 1904, the Fusch family entered the company through marriage. Today the K√∂rting company is in the fifth generation of K√∂rting/Fusch family ownership. The product line was continually adjusted throughout the 20th century, whereby the core competence ‚Äì flow devices (ejector pumps, nozzles, and industrial burners) ‚Äì became ever more sophisticated. In contrast, the motor- and turbine-engineering declined and were ultimately abandoned.  The K√∂rting Double-Acting Gas Engine  In 1900 Ernst K√∂rting filed patents\\"Improvements in or appertaining to Internal Combustion Engines\\", GB Patent GB190011038, filed June 1900 \\"Internal Combustion Engine\\", US Patent US746342, filed August 1900 for a novel design of gas engine. This engine had a single water cooled piston that was double acting, i.e. the cylinder had combustion chambers at either end. As the engine was a 2-stroke this gave it continuous power strokes, much as a double acting steam engine. The lack of continuous power strokes in internal combustion engines was perceived by those used to steam as having the potential for mechanical problems due to the intermittent power strokes. The K√∂rting design was quite successful in a range of applications particularly large installations powered by blast furnace gas. The prototype 350bhp engine was tested in June 1900 and the results presented in the 1900 annual meeting of the \\"Verein von Gas-und Wassefach M√§nnern\\". published by the German Gas Lighting Journal, and reproduced in The Engineer.\\"The Koerting Two-Cycle 350 Brake Horse Power Gas Engine\\", The Engineer, 4 January 1901, pp23-24 This article states that a four-stroke version of the double acting design was introduced two year before which also had both piston and rod cooled by water.

The 1909 Gross-Basenach experimental M III airship was equipped with two K√∂rting V8 engines. K√∂rting engines (initially paraffin engines and later diesel engines) were used extensively in early German submarines. The 6 cylinder 2-stroke submarine engine was reviewed in The Engineer magazine in August 1906.\\"Petroleum Motor for Submarines\\", The Engineer, 3 August 1906, pp116-117 This utilised crankcase compression, with the piston controlling all the ports. It was referred to as using petroleum, though this was almost certainly the less volatile paraffin/kerosene type, as it had exhaust heaters for the carburetors, and electric pre-heating of both cylinders and vaporisers, with the engine being turned over for some time by electrical power before being put to work. This allowing the engine to be started after 5 minutes. The engine was rated at 200bhp at 500rpm, and two were installed per submarine.

Behaviours associated with the C/C genotype of the C957T polymorphism * schizophrenia * diminished working memory ability * altered response to nicotine * reward related impulsivity * sucrose addiction * altered susceptibility to iatrogenic tardive dyskinesia Cambridge Journals Online - Abstract * altered fear conditioning * dissocial personality disorder * posttraumatic stress disorder >T polymorphism is associated with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in war veterans - Voisey - 2008 - Depression and Anxiety - Wiley Online Library] Given that the C/C genotype has been associated with dissocial personality disorder one may infer that this genotype may also be associated with all four DSM-IV defined cluster B personality disorders. This hypothesis, however, has not been tested. Rapid screening of the C957T and the TaqIA polymorphisms Given the importance of the C957T and TaqIA polymorphisms for the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorder, a rapid screening protocol for these genes has been developed. Since the DRD2 1101A allele nulls the effects of the 957T allele, screens for the 957C allele which ignore the 1101A allele can sometimes lead to false negatives.

A gene is said to be polymorphic if more than one allele occupies that gene's locus within a population. In addition to having more than one allele at a specific locus, each allele must also occur in the population at a rate of at least 1% to generally be considered polymorphic. Gene polymorphisms can occur in any region of the genome. The majority of polymorphisms are silent, meaning they do not alter the function or expression of a gene. Some polymorphism is visible. For example, in dogs the E locus, can have any of five different alleles, known as E, Em, Eg, Eh, and e. Varying combinations of these alleles contribute to the pigmentation and patterns seen in dog coats. A polymorphic variant of a gene can lead to the abnormal expression or to the production of an abnormal form of the protein; this abnormality may cause or be associated with disease. For example, a polymorphic variant of the gene encoding the enzyme CYP4A11, in which thymidine replaces cytosine at the gene's nucleotide 8590 position encodes a CYP4A11 protein that substitutes phenylalanine with serine at the protein's amino acid position 434. This variant protein has reduced enzyme activity in metabolizing arachidonic acid to the blood pressure-regulating eicosanoid, 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. A study has shown that humans bearing this variant in one or both of their CYP4A11 genes have an increased incidence of hypertension, ischemic stroke, and coronary artery disease. Most notably, the genes coding for the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) are in fact the most polymorphic genes known. MHC molecules are involved in the immune system and interact with T-cells. There are more than 800 different alleles of human MHC class I and II genes, and it has been estimated that there are 200 variants at the HLA-B HLA-DRB1 loci alone. Some polymorphism may be maintained by balancing selection.  Differences between gene polymorphism and mutation  A rule of thumb that is sometimes used is to classify genetic variants that occur below 1% allele frequency as mutations rather than polymorphisms. However, since polymorphisms may occur at low allele frequency, this is not a reliable way to tell new mutations from polymorphisms .  Identification  Polymorphisms can be identified in the laboratory using a variety of methods. Many methods employ PCR to amplify the sequence of a gene. Once amplified, polymorphisms and mutations in the sequence can be detected by DNA sequencing, either directly or after screening for variation with a method such as single strand conformation polymorphism analysis.  Types  A polymorphism can be any sequence difference. Examples include: * Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are a single nucleotide changes that happen in the genome in a particular location. The single nucleotide polymorphism is the most common form of genetic variation. * Small-scale insertions/deletions (Indels) consist of insertions or deletions of bases in DNA. * Polymorphic repetitive elements. Active transposable elements can also cause polymorphism by inserting themselves in new locations. For example, repetitive elements of the Alu and LINE1 families cause polymorphisms in human genome. * Microsatellites are repeats of 1-6 base pairs of DNA sequence. Microsatellites are commonly used as a molecular markers especially for identifying the relationship between alleles  Clinical significance   Lung cancer  Polymorphisms have been discovered in multiple XPD exons. XPD refers to ‚Äò‚Äô‚Äôxeroderma pigmentosum group D‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô and is involved in a DNA repair mechanism used during DNA replication. XPD works by cutting and removing segments of DNA that have been damaged due to things such as cigarette smoking and inhalation of other environmental carcinogens. Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln are the two common polymorphisms of XPD that result in a change in a single amino acid. This variation in Asn and Gln alleles has been related to individuals having a reduced DNA repair efficiency. Several studies have been conducted to see if this diminished capacity to repair DNA is related to an increased risk of lung cancer. These studies examined the XPD gene in lung cancer patients of varying age, gender, race, and pack-years. The studies provided mixed results, from concluding individuals who are homozygous for the Asn allele or homozygous for the Gln allele had an increased risk of developing lung cancer, to finding no statistical significance between smokers who have either allele polymorphism and their susceptibility to lung cancer. Research continues to be conducted to determine the relationship between XPD polymorphisms and lung cancer risk.  Asthma  Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the lungs and more than 100 loci have been identified as contributing to the development and severity of the condition. By using the traditional linkage analysis, these asthma correlated genes were able to be identified in small quantities using Genome- wide association studies (GWAS). There have been a number of studies looking into various polymorphisms of asthma-associated genes and how those polymorphisms interact with the carrier's environment. One example is the gene CD14, which is known to have a polymorphism that is associated with increased amounts of CD14 protein as well as reduced levels of IgE serum. A study was conducted on 624 children looking at their IgE serum levels as it related to the polymorphism in CD14. The study found that IgE serum levels differed in children with the C allele in the CD14/-260 gene based on the type of allergens they regularly exposed to. Children who were in regular contact with house pets showed higher serum levels of IgE while children who were regularly exposed to stable animals showed lower serum levels of IgE. Continued research into gene-environment interactions may lead to more specialized treatment plans based on an individual's surroundings.

Having started his career with Stevenage Borough, he spent time on loan with Northwood, Yeading, Maidenhead United and Diss Town before moving to AFC Wimbledon in 2007 where he notched up 197 league appearances and 22 goals, also helping them earn promotion to the Football League in 2011. He joined Grimsby Town in 2012 where he remained for two seasons. Sam is known for being able to slot in anywhere among the back 4 and also centre mid, he is also known for being extremely comfortable on the ball and his crossing ability and his set piece ability Club career Stevenage Borough Born in St Albans, Hertfordshire, Hatton progressed through the ranks of the Stevenage Borough academy but only made one first team appearance for the Conference National side. His time at Stevenage was frustrating, as he was loaned out a total of five times between 2006 and 2007. AFC Wimbledon In the 2007‚Äì8 pre-season, Hatton was signed by AFC Wimbledon. He performed consistently over the course of five seasons, at first in midfield before converting to right back and was a part of three promotions, including the historic season that saw the club's promotion to the Football League. He was the club's longest serving player, having made 197 league appearances up to the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season. In May 2011, he was voted by the Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association as player of the 2010‚Äì11 season. On 15 May 2012, Hatton was released by AFC Wimbledon. Manager Terry Brown announced through the AFC Wimbledon website that the club would not take up an option to extend Hatton's contract for the 2012‚Äì13 season. Brown described this as: \\"Definitely one of the hardest decisions I have had to make as a manager.\\" Grimsby Town On 23 June 2012, Hatton signed a two-year contract with Conference Premier side Grimsby Town. He was primarily used as Grimsby's first choice right back for both the 2012‚Äì13 and 2013‚Äì14 seasons. Both seasons ended with the club being defeated in the Conference Play-off semi finals. He was amongst a number of players released on 9 May 2014.http://www.thefishy.co.uk/story.php?id=8502625 Aldershot Town After being released by Grimsby Town, Hatton signed for fellow Conference Premier club Aldershot Town in July 2014.http://www.nonleaguedaily.com/latest-transfer-news/shots-conclude-deal- for-versatile-midfielder-hatton.html Grimsby Town On Friday 18 May 2018, Sam Hatton signed for Wealdstone https://twitter.com/wealdstonefc/status/997469437728051201 International career During his time with AFC Wimbledon in the Conference Premier, Hatton appeared twice for England C, playing in matches against the Republic of Ireland U23 in 2010 and Belgium U23 in 2011. Hatton was called up to the England C team again in 2012. Having featured in two out of five of Grimsby's games, Hatton was named in the England C squad to face Belgium in Brussels on Wednesday 12 September in an International Challenge Trophy game.

Over the course of its nine-year history, before its sale to Rounder Records in 1982, Philo produced roughly 100 albums of folk, traditional, and later, jazz, world, and new music from a converted barn-studio in North Ferrisburg, Vermont. Philo's allure to many established and emerging artists was its policy of giving them full control over their productions and repertoire. Early years Philo Records (as distinct from the Philo Records founded in California in 1945 by Eddie, Leo and Ira Messner, a jazz and R&B; label) was founded in 1973 in a barn in North Ferrisburg, Vermont by half-brothers Bill Schubart and Michael Couture. The two brothers shared a love of eclectic music and Couture was himself a performing musician, while Schubart had long dabbled in recording various folk and classical groups. Schubart bought a vacant dairy barn on eight acres in 1969 that had been recently used to raise pigs, steam-cleaned it and elicited the help of an architect friend, Arthur Norcross, to create a home recording studio. The studio opened as Earth Audio Techniques in 1972. Schubart and Couture founded Philo Records to produce and distribute some of the music they had recorded at Earth Audio. The first two releases in 1973 were Philo 1000 The UVM Choral Union performing The Psalmody and Fuguing tunes of Justin Morgan (of Morgan Horse fame) and Philo 2000 Louis Beaudoin, the soon to become renowned French-Canadian fiddler. These two releases loosely defined the 1000 series of more popular releases and the 2000 series that was more strictly roots or traditional music. In 1979, the 9000 series was added to include jazz, world and new music releases. Philo‚Äôs aesthetic hallmark was its artist-centered culture. The prevailing industry employment of sA&R; (artists & repertoire) executives who choose material, hire arrangers and sidemen, and then oversee the production of market-ready music was never adopted at Philo. Schubart and Couture chose musicians, not for only their renown, but for their ability to perform live outside the studio. They often opted to record unknown artists whose work they respected and gave them full control over their own production and choice of sidemen. Their goal was to capture on LP the artist‚Äôs own vision of their music. There was no prescribed company vision. This, of course, cut both ways. The company produced a number of releases that received significant critical acclaim but sold only a few hundred copies. It also led to considerable success and the debut of a number of new faces in the folk, traditional and, later, new music fields such as: Tom Mitchell, Kilimanjaro, Mary McCaslin and Jim Ringer Engineers Resident engineers included co-founders Michael Couture and Bill Schubart, and also Chas Eller and David Green. Gregg Lamping served as the technical engineer. Artists Philo‚Äôs better known artists included Mary McCaslin, Jim Ringer, Jean Carignan (Canada), Dave van Ronk, Rosalie Sorrels, Jean Redpath, The Boys of the Lough, Utah Phillips, The New Black Eagle Jazz Band, Bill Staines, Kilimanjaro, Patty Larkin, Martin Grosswendt, and Nanci Griffith. Bought by Rounder Records In 1979, the music industry suffered major losses from piracy and the collapse of the two-tier distribution system. In that year, Philo saw two of its major distributors fail and the significant loss of receivables triggered a chapter 11 filing under which Philo sought bankruptcy protection. The label limped along for two and a half more years continuing to pay down its debts and then sold itself to Rounder Records which assumed the label name and catalog of artists. Rounder proved to be a good steward, keeping many of the albums available and converting many to the then- new CD format. Rounder added other well-known artists to the roster including: Ray Wylie Hubbard, Ellis Paul, Bill Morrissey, Iris Dement, Carrie Newcomer, Christine Lavin, Vance Gilbert and Cliff Eberhardt. In the continuing consolidation of a collapsing music media industry, Rounder itself was sold to Concord Music Group in April 2010.

Using this weapon requires the soldier to close right in with his enemy. The fact that its use is going to be bloody and horrible means that only a strong or well conditioned individual is going to be able to use it in anger.\\" The combat knife and the trench knife are examples of military fighting knives.Peterson, Harold L., Daggers and Fighting Knives of the Western World, Courier Dover Publications, , (2001), p. 80: \\"Right at the outset trench knives were introduced by both sides during World War I, so that the common soldier was once again equipped with a knife designed primarily for combat.\\" Fighting knives were traditionally designed as special-purpose weapons, intended primarily if not solely for use in personal or hand-to-hand combat. This singularity of purpose originally distinguished the fighting knife from the field knife, fighting utility knife, or in modern usage, the tactical knife. The tactical knife is a knife with one or more military features designed for use in extreme situations, which may or may not include a design capability as a fighting or combat weapon.Shideler, Dan, Sigler, Derrek, and Ramage, Ken (eds.), The Gun Digest Book Of Tactical Gear, Krause Publications, , (2008), p. 7 Since World War I, the fighting knife in military service has gradually evolved into a dual-purpose or \\"fighting- utility\\" knife, suited for both knife fighting and utility roles. As a consequence, the terms \\"fighting knife\\" and \\"tactical knife\\" are frequently employed interchangeably. History Ancient history Utility knives with stone or flint blades were undoubtedly used in personal combat since Paleolithic times. One of the earliest metal-blade fighting knives was the dagger. The first early Bronze Age daggers featured Beaker copper blades, probably done with stone tools. In 1984, a Beaker period (ca. 2500 ‚Äì 2000 BC) copper dagger blade was recovered from the Sillees River near Ross Lough, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland that had a remarkably modern appearance.Sheridan, Alison, A Beaker Period Copper Dagger Blade from the Silees River near Ross Lough, Co. Fermanagh, Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 56 (1993), pp. 61-62 The flat, triangular-shaped copper blade was 171 mm (6.75 inches) long, 42.5 mm (1.65 inches) wide, and 2mm (0.078 inches) in maximum thickness, with bevelled edges and a pointed tip, and featured an integral tang that accepted a riveted handle. Analysis of the copper used in the dagger's construction revealed it to be of a type characteristic of the copper that was widely used in Ireland before the introduction of bronze tools and weapons. By around 2000 BC daggers were being cast of bronze, with blades formed by drawing and hammering the metal on bronze anvils set in guides.Coffey, George, The Bronze Age in Ireland, Dublin, IRL: Dublin University Press (1913), retrieved 31 July 2011 Post-classical history An early iron-bladed knife that served a dual purpose as fighting knife and utility blade was the seax, a pattern-welded weapon which dates from the 5th century AD, and worn as standard armament by Anglo-Saxon warriors from northern Italy as far north as Scandinavia and as far west as Ireland.Underwood, Richard, Anglo Saxon Weapons & Warfare (2nd ed.), London: Tempus Publications Ltd., , (2001) The seax of the 5th and 6th century was shorter and narrower than those introduced later on, and could be described as either a large dagger or a short sword. As swords created from pattern-welded iron were enormously expensive weapons at the time, the early seax filled a need for an affordable blade that could be used as both a fighting knife and a utility knife. With the development of steel and simplified forging techniques, the sword became the preferred bladed weapon for most professional fighting men. During the latter part of the 12th century, the steel-blade dagger became popular as a secondary weapon for knights as a standard part of their equipment. This new form of dagger was really a miniaturized sword, featuring a flat double-edged blade and central spine or fuller. The first fighting daggers to become widely popular in Europe were the rondel dagger and the bollock dagger. The rondel dagger was a fighting knife with a double- edged, tapered blade and a hilt featuring circular guards. The bollock dagger dates from around 1300‚Äì1350, and had a distinctive hilt cap formed from two lobes that acted as a hand-stop.Walker, Greg, Battle Blades: A Professional's Guide to Combat/Fighting Knives, Boulder, CO: Paladin Press, (1993), pp. 28, 50-55, 130 It was especially popular with English and Norwegian combatants.N√∏ttveit, Ole-Magne, The Kidney Dagger as a Symbol of Masculine Identity, Norwegian Archeological Review, Vol. 39 No.2 (2006), pp. 138-150 French and Italian daggers of the 14th century were the first to introduce acutely tapered blades and reinforced points in response to improvements made in armor design and the need for penetration. Modern history Early modern In the Near East, fighting knives such as the pesh-kabz were developed originally to defeat enemy personnel wearing leather armour.Paul, E. Jaiwant, Arms and Armour: Traditional Weapons of India (1st ed.), Roli Books, , (2005), pp. 67-70 The pesh-kabz dates from the 17th century and is of Central Asian and Persian origin, but was later adopted by the Mughals, who brought the knife with them on their campaigns to conquer India. It was subsequently adopted throughout Afghanistan, northern India, and what is now Pakistan. As the importance of the dagger declined in military service, the weapon became extremely popular in civilian society as an item of daily wear, being used for everything from personal defense to dinner cutlery. In Andalucian Spain the personal fighting knife was epitomized by the famous ratcheting folding knife known generally as the navaja.de Rementeria y Fica, Mariano, Manual of the Baratero (transl. and annot. by James Loriega), Boulder, CO: Paladin Press, (2005) The navaja was originally used primarily by the barateros of the underworld and the working class, but by the 1800s it had become an accepted personal weapon for Spanish men of all backgrounds, including the wealthy. In Portugal, the faca, a large fixed-blade fighting and utility knife accompanied Portuguese explorers and settlers during their conquest of Brazil, where the pattern remains popular to this day. From the faca is derived the fac√≥n, the large fighting-utility knife of the gaucho. The fac√≥n is widely used in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay in an indigenous style of knife fighting inspired by Andalusian knife fighting techniques known as esgrima criolla (\\"Creole fencing\\").de Rementeria y Fica, Manual of the Baratero, pp 5-6, 9, 12: The esgrima de criolla method of knife fighting employed by the gaucho and his fac√≥n in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, using clothing to protect the weaponless arm, is derived directly from el legado andal√∫z. Late modern =19th century= Top: Bowie Knife c. 1850s Bottom: Naval Bowie Knife c. 1860s In North America, the advantages of a large fighting knife were seized upon by American frontiersmen, who faced both animal and human opponents of considerable ferocity. This popularity spiked in 1827 with the introduction of Bowie Knife, a pattern inspired by the knives commissioned by Rezin Bowie, brother of the better known James \\"Jim\\" Bowie. James became famous after killing one Norris Wright in a bloody melee at the Vidalia Sandbar Fight, but brother Rezin was the knife lover in the family. After the Bowie knife pattern was standardized during the 1830s and 1840s, it proved to be an enormously popular design, so much so that during the mid-19th century it became synonymous with the term \\"fighting knife\\".Todd, Frederick P., American Military Equipage, 1851‚Äì1872, Scribners (1980), pp. 180-181: \\"The American fighting knife of the mid-19th century was par excellence the 'bowie knife'. The term itself defied definition in those days as it does today, but a rough description would be a large sheath knife, usually with a small cross guard and a clipped point, whose story began in the American Southwest about 1830.\\" The fighting Bowies of 1830‚Äì1860 usually had 10 to 12 inch blades; some were even larger. The Bowie knife largely replaced earlier Native American tools and weapons such as the tomahawk. Before the introduction of reliable and powerful cap-and-ball revolvers on the American frontier, the Bowie knife was often preferred to a single-shot handgun or \\"horse pistol\\". During the later years of the 19th century, the classic Bowie knife pattern would be gradually reduced in size and length as its role changed from that of a dedicated fighting knife and weapon to a general-purpose knife and tool that could be used as a fighting knife in an emergency. =20th century= By 1900, civilian fighting knives were being mass-produced in a countless variety of shapes and sizes, though they all shared the common characteristic of being primarily designed for use in physical combat. However, in military service, the traditional fighting knife began a gradual transition from a \\"pure\\" design intended solely for fighting to a knife that could fulfill other roles as well. This trend was not unprecedented, as many nations and cultures had already adopted various multi-purpose fighting knife patterns derived from popular general-purpose knives with cultural and historic roots, beginning with the Anglo Saxon seax of medieval times. Thus Chilean soldiers, for instance, were trained in the use of the Corvo, a traditional Chilean military weapon, while Gurkha regiments of the Indian Army serving the British Empire favored the Kukri, a broad-bladed, curved general-purpose cutting tool and weapon with Indian origins. In other countries the machete or Filipino Bolo were often used as fighting knives by indigenous military or paramilitary forces. Colonial powers that encountered these general-purpose weapons used as fighting knives during a military campaign occasionally adopted them in turn for use by their own military forces, as exemplified by the U.S. Army's Model 1910/17 \\"Bolo\\" brush-clearing knife, which would be later pressed into service as a fighting knife in both World Wars.Henry, Mark, R., The US Army of World War I, London: Osprey Publishing Ltd., (2003), p. 36Henry, Mark R., The US Army in World War II (1): The Pacific, London: Osprey Publishing Ltd., (2000) p. 33 M1918 Trench Knife In World War I, military use of the fighting knife saw the introduction of the \\"trench knife\\", a fighting knife designed solely for military use in the trench warfare of that conflict. On the Allied side, these \\"knives\\" were originally little more than sharpened spikes or cut-down bayonets fitted with handles. As the war progressed, French, British and U.S. ordnance branches began introducing fighting knives based on standardized patterns, such as the U.S. Mark I trench knife. In Western Europe, one dual- purpose fighting knife to be widely adopted by German forces during World War I was the Nahkampfmesser (Close Combat Knife), which despite its name was actually a general-purpose combat and field knife. The Nahkampfmesser was extremely popular in German military service, and would be issued again in slightly revised form during World War II as the Kampfmesser 42. World War II U.S. Marine KA-BAR Knife In the Pacific theater of World War II, U.S. Army and Marine Corps personnel frequently employed jungle and utility knives such as machetes, bush knives,Safreed, Robert, The U.S. Marine Corps Grips, Stances, and Targets (Inset: Fighting Knives of the Marines), Black Belt Magazine, Vol. 30 No. 9 (September 1992), p. 60: The \\"bush knife\\" used in World War II was none other than the 1941 Model LC-14-B, otherwise known as the \\"Woodsman's Pal\\", manufactured by the Victor Tool Co. of Reading, Pennsylvania.Whittaker, Wayne, Tough Guys, Popular Mechanics, February 1943, Vol. 79 No. 2, pp. 41, 44-45 hospital corps knives,Rila, Carter, Military Myths and Misconceptions 6: USMC Hospital Corps Knife, Carter's Commentaries, retrieved 30 July 2011: The M1915 USMC Hospital Corps Knife was issued by the Marine Corps during World War II. It was a knife with a rounded-tip, cleaver- type blade originally intended for use by naval hospital corpsmen to clear brush and cut wood for litters or shelter poles. In 1942 the M1915 was issued to Marines (one knife per squad) for use as a utility entrenching tool. and bolos as fighting knives.Safreed, Robert, The U.S. Marine Corps Grips, Stances, and Targets (Inset: Fighting Knives of the Marines), Black Belt Magazine, Vol. 30 No. 9 (September 1992), p. 60Alexander, Joseph H., Edson's Raiders: The 1st Marine Raider Battalion in World War II, Annapolis MD: Naval Institute Press, (2001), p. 67Rila, Carter, Military Myths and Misconceptions #3: The Little Machetes, Carter's Cutlery Commentarires (2005), retrieved 23 July 2011 These knives were particularly favored by elite or specialist units such as the U.S. Army's Bushmaster regiment and Pioneer combat engineer detachment and the Marine Raider and Paramarine battalions of the U.S. Marine Corps. The success of these large knives in individual combat engagements caused authorities to reexamine the suitability of existing \\"commando\\"-type fighting knives for troops expected to fight the Japanese. In late 1942, the U.S. Marine Corps adopted the 1219C2, later designated the USMC Mark 2 Combat Knife or Knife, Fighting Utility, but better known in popular terminology as the KA-BAR.Shackleford, Steve (ed.), Blade's Guide To Knives And Their Values (7th ed.), Iola, WI: Krause Publications, , p. 387 The KA-BAR differed from World War I-era U.S. fighting knives in that it was purposely designed as a dual-purpose weapon, adapted for both combat and as a utility knife.Sledge, E.B., With The Old Breed: At Peleleiu and Okinawa, Presidio Press, (2007), pp. 21-22 It also differed from some earlier USMC knives such as the Marine Raider Stiletto in that the new knife used a stout, wide blade with clip point that facilitated slashing attacks as well as blade thrusts.MCRP 3-02B: Close Combat, Washington, D.C.: Department Of The Navy, Headquarters United States Marine Corps, 12 February 1999: \\"Marines use slashing techniques to close with an enemy. Slashing techniques distract or damage an opponent so Marines can close in.\\" Subsequent reports on the effectiveness of the new knife in jungle combat substantiated the Marine Corps decision to standardize the KA-BAR as the USMC's fighting knife for individual Marines. Fairbairn-Sykes fighting Knife In contrast, in 1941 Great Britain introduced one of the most famous \\"pure\\" fighting knives designed specifically for military use in combat, the British Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife (F-S). A traditional single-purpose fighting knife, with an acutely pointed, stiletto-type blade designed to emphasize thrusting strokes (puncture wounds), the F-S was based on the concepts and ideas of William E. Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes, two renowned former members of the Shanghai Municipal Police who trained countless soldiers in the art of close-quarters fighting. The Fairbairn-Sykes knife inspired several similar knives of the era such as the V-42 Stiletto designed by Lt. Colonel Robert T. Frederick, who commanded the joint US and Canadian First Special Service Force and the United States Marine Raider Stiletto designed by Lieutenant Colonel Clifford H. Shuey. Capt. Fairbairn would later introduce a much larger fighting knife, the Smatchet, based on the traditional Welsh Fusiliers trench knife of World War I.The Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum, retrieved 29 July 2011: Contrary to popular legend, the leaf-shaped Welsh Fusiliers fighting knife was not based on a traditional Welch fighting knife, but instead was taken directly from a patented design created by Felix Joubert, a knife collector and arms restoration expert. The U.S. Army adopted the M3 Fighting Knife in 1943 as its standard fighting knife. The M3 replaced the earlier World War I-vintage Mark I trench knife in combat service. The M3 was designed primarily designed as a purist fighting knife, though some compromises were made in the design to conserve strategic materials.Catalog of Standard Ordnance Items, Washington, D.C: U.S. Army Ordnance Publications (1943)Cassidy, William L. (1997), The Complete Book of Knife Fighting, , (1997), pp. 47-48Whitman, L., New Army Trench Knife, Army & Navy Journal, Vol. 80, 6 February 1943, p. 649 When adapted to utility tasks such as opening ration tins or ammunition boxes, the limitations of the M3 pattern quickly became apparent. In the United States, Knifemaker Bo Randall began production of the \\"All Purpose Fighting Knife\\" giving it the designation of \\"Number 1\\" in his catalog. Between 1942 and 1945, Randall Made Knives produced 4,000 of these knives for battlefield use by US troops, with approximately 1,058 knives additionally subcontracted to another firm to meet wartime demand. In the 1950s Randall would adopt the general pattern of the Bowie knife for several of his fighting knife designs.Pacella (2002)pp. 130-131 Post-WWII to present Designed for military use, Bo Randall's No. 14 \\"Attack\\" Model was a popular fighting knife used after World War II. During Vietnam, Randall received feedback from Captain George Ingraham, a Combat Surgeon in the US Army's 94th Medical Detachment. Ingraham's request was for serrations on the spine to cut through the fuselage of downed aircraft to rescue trapped personnel and a hollow handle to allow storage of survival gear. Randall made the changes and the result was the first of the modern survival knives. During the Vietnam War, the Gerber Mark II, designed by US Army Captain Bud Holzman and Al Mar, was a popular fighting knife pattern that was privately purchased by many U.S. soldiers and marines serving in that conflict. In the 1970s and 1980s a student and protege of Fairbairn, Colonel Rex Applegate worked with knife designer Bill Harsey, Jr. to design the Applegate-Fairbairn Combat Knife, so named because it was designed as an improvement on the Fairbairn- Sykes based upon discussions Applegate and Fairbairn had during World War II to eliminate the weaknesses of the F-S knife (e.g., weak blade point, inability to determine orientation of blade merely by grip). While the Applegate-Fairbairn Combat Knife had a blade design that was more versatile than the F-S fighting knife, the former remained primarily a single-purpose fighting knife design. The first of these knives were made by Al Mar Knives, based on Harsey's designs.Pacella (2002) p. 145 Tactical knife Emerson's custom CQC6 alongside Benchmade's 970 (CQC7) A tactical knife is a knife with one or more military (martial) features designed for use in extreme situations. In popular usage the terms \\"fighting knife\\" and \\"tactical knife\\" are frequently employed interchangeably, although tactical knife is principally designed to be used as a utility tool, not as a weapon.Lesce, Tony, Police Products Handbook, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall Publications, , (1990), pp. 287-288: \\"...the police knife is not a weapon, and the [police] officer should not think of it as a weapon. The police knife is a tool, and the tactical knife even more so.\\" Folding knives are rarely if ever designed primarily for use as fighting knives or combat knives. However, many armies and military organizations have issued folding \\"utility\\" knives that were not intended to be used as weapons, but which had tactical features that appealed to military personnel as well as civilians. This includes the German Mercator \\"Black Cat\\" folding utility knife,The Origins of the Mercator K55K German Knife, retrieved 30 July 2011 the German Luftwaffe Fallschirmj√§ger- Messer, the British Ibberson World War II gravity knife, and the U.S. World War II M2 automatic pressbutton utility knife, also intended for use by parachute troops and flight crews. Many civilian folding knives also have been privately purchased by both civilians and military personnel for use as general-purpose utility knives. Among these is Buck Knives' Model 110 Folding Hunter, a lockback folding knife. Originally marketed as a hunting knife, the Model 110 saw use with military and naval personnel as a utility or emergency knife for cutting rope, strapping, harnesses, rigging, and a variety of other tasks. Custom knife makers began making similar knives intended for private purchase use by both civilians and military personnel. The earliest production company to make a tactical knife was Al Mar Knives with their SERE model designed for the military with input from Special Forces Colonel James N. Rowe in 1979. By the 1990s, tactical folding knife sales had risen sharply, and new designs were being regularly introduced at many large gun and knife shows. The trend began with custom knifemakers such as Bob Terzuola, Michael Walker, Mel Pardue, Ernest Emerson, Ken Onion, Chris Reeve, Warren Thomas and Warren Osbourne.Walker, Greg, Battle Blades: A Professional's Guide to Combat/Fighting Knives, Boulder, CO: Paladin Press, (1993), p. 130 These knives were most commonly built as linerlocks, although McHenry & Williams introduced the Axis lock, which is used by Benchmade Knife Company, under license.http://www.benchmade.com/products/designers.aspx Blade lengths varied from 3 inches to as long as 12 inches, but the most typical models never exceeded 4 inches in blade length for legal reasons in most US Jurisdictions. Knifemaker Bob Terzuola is credited with coining the phrase \\"Tactical Folder\\". In response to the demand for these knives, production companies offered mass- produced tactical folding knives Companies such as Benchmade, Kershaw Knives, Buck Knives, Al Mar Knives, Gerber Legendary Blades and Spyderco collaborated with tactical knifemakers; in some cases retaining them as full-time designers. Tactical knifemakers such as Ernest Emerson and Chris Reeve went so far as to open their own mass-production factories with Emerson Knives, Inc. and Chris Reeve Knives. Critics of the \\"tactical\\" folding knife point out that the design is not well suited for individual combat when compared to a purpose-built fixed blade combat knife or fighting knife. The very nature of a folding knife means that it will usually have to be retrieved and its blade deployed during a fight - an impractical maneuver during a fight. Students of knife fighting also point out that any locking mechanism can fail and that a folding knife, regardless of lock strength, can never be as reliable as a fixed-blade combat knife. Lynn Thompson, martial artist and CEO of Cold Steel pointed out in an article in Black Belt magazine that most tactical folding knives are too short to be of use in a knife fight and that even though he manufactures, sells, and carries a tactical folder, it is not ideal for fighting.

W«î X√≠ng painting has a total of five brush strokes, five movements, and five types of composition, corresponding to the elements ‚ÄúWood‚Äù, ‚ÄúFire‚Äù, ‚ÄúEarth‚Äù, ‚ÄúMetal‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWater‚Äù. W«î X√≠ng painting is metaphysics. Through W«î X√≠ng painting one can create a picture identical in its external appearance to any example of traditional Chinese painting. In this regard there is no difference between W«î X√≠ng painting and Chinese painting. Still, if one compares W«î X√≠ng painting and Guo Hua there are a number of differences in technique: Traditional Guo Hua painting is divided into several genres: mountains and water, birds and branches, grass and insects, etc. and does not usually extend beyond these genres. W«î X√≠ng painting is not tied to any genres. Using the five brush strokes the artist can paint everything that they want. Traditional Chinese Guo Hua painting inherited an attachment to rice paper and silk as well as to a certain type of paint, while W«î X√≠ng has no such limitations. The single most important thing for the artist who practices W«î X√≠ng painting is an attractive image harmoniously constructed using the W«î X√≠ng system. Everything else is secondary, including the type of artistic materials, the genre, and so on.  References   External links  * [M. A. Parnakh.

These disorders are characterized by dramatic, overly emotional or unpredictable thinking or behavior and interactions with others. They include antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder. The British National Health Service has described those with this disorder as someone who, \\"struggles to relate to others. As a result, they show patterns of behaviour most would regard as dramatic, erratic and threatening or disturbing.\\"  Four Recognized Cluster B Personality Disorders:  Each of these disorders, while similar, have a variety of symptoms, diagnoses, and causes. * Antisocial personality disorder (DSM-IV code 301.7): Symptoms: Indifferent and routine manipulation, exploitation, and violation of the rights of others. It can also be characterized by routine law breaking. Cause: Signs of Antisocial Personality Disorder often first become evident in childhood. Consequently, although the cause is unknown, it is believed that a more difficult childhood can lead to APD. Diagnosis: While symptoms can start to show themselves in the early teen years, a diagnosis cannot be made until adulthood. To be diagnosed, the patient must fit at least three of the most common indicators such as recklessness, irresponsibility, apathy, and irritability. * Borderline personality disorder (DSM-IV code 301.83): Symptoms: Difficulty regulating emotions, impulsivity, self harm, dissociative feelings, and even psychotic episodes. Cause: 1. Genetics - Those with a family member who has BPD are considered more likely to develop the disorder. 2. Trauma - Trauma such as assault or neglect early in life may lead to BPD. Diagnosis: Unlike many psychological disorders, there is no strict guideline for the diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder. * Histrionic personality disorder (DSM-IV code 301.50): Symptoms:an overwhelming desire for attention, chronically unstable emotions, sensitivity, gullibility, and reckless behavior. Cause: It is believed that Histrionic Personality Disorder can either be inherited genetically or learned behavior in early childhood. Diagnosis: To diagnose the disorder, there is no strict guideline; however, a doctor may begin by evaluating the patient's medical history and physical well-being to ensure that the causes of the symptoms are mental rather than physical. * Narcissistic personality disorder (DSM-IV code 301.81): Symptoms: a magnified sense of self importance, underlying deep self esteem issues, exaggeration, manipulation, envy, arrogance, impatience, depression. Like HPD, it can cause an excessive need for attention and approval. Causes: It can be caused by genetics, environment, or neurobiology. Diagnosis: NPD may often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, as patients often display symptoms similar to other disorders, or may not be willing to admit there is anything wrong. It may be treated with talk therapy (psychotherapy).  Cluster B traits and common symptoms  Cluster B personality disorders are all characterized by emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and frequent interpersonal conflicts. These individuals present as \\"dramatic\\", \\"emotional\\", and \\"erratic\\". The predominant theme and shared trait among Cluster B personalities is a lack of emotional empathy and the presence of egocentrism. Dr. Simon Baron-Cohen posited that empathy is a spectrum, at one end of the distribution lies the \\"zero-negative empathy\\"; this is where antisocial, borderline, and narcissistic personality disorders are placed, which is why individuals with these personality disorders are capable of dehumanizing others, leading to acts of cruelty. Borderlines, sociopaths, and narcissists are considered \\"zero-negative empathy\\" because they are \\"unequivocally bad for the sufferers and all those around them\\". Dr. Baron-Cohen did not include histrionic personality disorder in the zero negative empathy category because they are capable of empathy. Individuals with histrionic personality disorder have a greater capacity for dependent relations than do those with narcissistic, borderline, and antisocial personality disorders, and they are more emotionally expressive and less dismissive of others.  Causes and Risk Factors  Personality disorders are likely caused by a combination of genetics and environmental factors. In a study, information found a strong correlation between borderline personality disorder and history of sexual trauma. Research has found a significant link between cluster B personality disorders and family history as well. Having a parent or sibling with a personality disorder increases your risk for developing the disorder.  Treatment and Medications  Treatment is centered around the use of psychotherapy. There are no medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of personality disorders. However, medications are sometimes prescribed to target symptom domains (e.g. aggression and explosive anger, impulsivity) or treat co-occurring mental health problems.

There was a contested election as the University establishment's candidate, Lord Tedder, was opposed by a group of Dons who favoured Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru was nominated without giving him an opportunity to withdraw, and although honoured by the nomination, felt he could be of no service to the University. Although Nehru (who found opinion in India was against his being nominated) eventually persuaded his supporters to withdraw his name, a nominal election was required and took place on Friday 10 November, Tedder being declared the winner but without disclosing the number of votes cast. Candidates Early speculation about suitable names for the new Chancellor centred on Earl Mountbatten of Burma, or the Duke of Gloucester.\\"Cambridge Diary\\", Varsity, 14 October 1950, p. 3. An editorial in the student newspaper Varsity on 14 October 1950 began by stating clearly \\"The person we would like to see installed as Chancellor of Cambridge University is obviously someone of wide repute within the British Commonwealth\\" and suggested that Pandit Nehru, Prime Minister of India, was such a person. The editorial praised Nehru for maintaining impartiality in the Korean War, repeatedly advising peaceful resolution of international disputes, and not allowing India to become part of the spheres of influence of either the USA or USSR.\\"Viewpoint\\", Varsity, 14 October 1950, p. 2. Nehru had studied at Cambridge (Trinity College, 1907-1910). An informal meeting of the Senate held on Saturday 14 October 1950 recommended Lord Tedder, who had been Deputy Supreme Commander under Eisenhower during the closing stages of World War II and recently retired as Chief of the Air Staff. Tedder had also studied at Cambridge (Magdalene College, 1909-1913). After the meeting a fly-sheet was circulated inviting signatures from members of the Senate to nominate Tedder, and giving a list of those who already intended to sign. The list included most heads of Colleges and members of the council of the Senate, the University's principal governing institution. Tedder was recommended on the basis of his military experience, and connections with Cambridge: he had been made an honorary Fellow of his old College, and received an honorary Doctorate. Chemistry professor Ronald G.W. Norrish, one of his supporters, explained that choosing Nehru would be suitable if the University had wanted to \\"take an active part in the world of politics\\", but that Tedder was suitable because he was not a political figure.\\"Lord Tedder may be new Chancellor\\", Varsity, 21 October 1950, p. 1. Contest In response, a fly-sheet in favour of Nehru was published on Wednesday 25 October, said to be a spontaneous reaction against the suggestion of Tedder, and it was said that it started with well over 100 signatures. Those supporting Nehru argued that support in him would show how highly the \\"virtues of peace\\" were valued, and noted that almost all the names supporting Tedder were very senior figures.\\"Strong Support for Nehru\\", Varsity, 28 October 1950, p. 1. When nominations closed, there were a total of 333 names nominating Tedder and 153 nominating Nehru.\\"Cambridge Chancellor\\", The Times, 3 November 1950, p. 4. The official list of nominators is in Cambridge University Reporter, No. 3711 (Vol LXXXI No. 9), 2 November 1950. Some well- known Cambridge graduates supported the Nehru campaign, including Bertrand Russell, E. M. Forster, R. A. Butler and Lord Mountbatten.Sarvepalli Gopal, \\"Jawaharlal Nehru: A Biography\\", vol 2, Jonathan Cape, 1979, p. 111-112. The date of election was set for 10 November and the hours of polling were extended into the evening in anticipation of heavy participation by members of the Senate; as every recipient of a Master of Arts degree was a member of the Senate, and Cambridge raised every graduate to this degree six years after matriculation, almost every Cambridge graduate was eligible to vote. Some concern was raised by Varsity that the announcement of the election procedure specified that the names of voters, and the candidate for whom they had voted, would be published. The announcement had said this was \\"in accordance with ancient custom\\" but it was noted that the regulations had not been altered since the introduction of the secret ballot for Parliamentary elections.\\"Concern over Chancellor Election System\\", Varsity, 4 November 1950, p. 1. It was later speculated that the reason for announcing that votes would be published was to intimidate senior members who were planning to vote for Nehru.\\"Election of Chancellor\\" (Viewpoint), Varsity, 11 November 1950, p. 6. On behalf of Nehru, a circular was sent to all Masters of Arts and transport was said to be being arranged from London and Oxford, as all votes had to be cast in person. One letter in Varsity regretted the contested election and pointed out Nehru's supporters' wish to further Anglo-Indian understanding would be undermined if Nehru was defeated and the election \\"attracted the attention of racial or political propagandists\\".Letters, Varsity, 4 November 1950, p. 8. Nehru withdraws The High Commissioner of India to the United Kingdom, V. K. Krishna Menon, was notified that a delegation would be arriving on 23 October to report their desire to nominate Nehru. He sent a telegram to Nehru, mistakenly referring to the vacant office as that of the Vice- Chancellor, and commenting that opinion within the University was in Nehru's favour. Nehru cabled back on the following day correcting the error, and instructing Krishna Menon to tell the delegation that he was \\"deeply sensible of honour especially coming from my old University\\" but that he could not accept when he could be of no service. He stressed that it would be undesirable to enter into a contested election.\\"Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru\\", Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund, 2nd Series, vol 15 part 1, p. 563. Nehru cabled again on 30 October when his nomination was announced, complaining that \\"embarrassing questions are put to me\\" and stated \\"on no account am I going to be a party to a contest\\". Krishna Menon replied that the Vice-Chancellor had formally written asking whether Nehru accepted nomination; he noted that in 1847 Prince Albert had not consented to nomination but did not interfere when he was actually nominated.\\"Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru\\", Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund, 2nd Series, vol 15 part 2, p. 661. Nehru consulted Lord Pethick-Lawrence, and replied at length on 2 November explaining that reaction in India were \\"strongly unfavourable\\" to his contesting the election, and imploring Krishna Menon to get his supporters to withdraw his name.\\"Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru\\", Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund, 2nd Series, vol 15 part 2, p. 661-662. One of Nehru's biographers has claimed that \\"it was generally recognized that in any election Nehru would carry the majority\\". It was not until after the notice of election was published that the Vice-Chancellor received a letter signed by ten of Nehru's supporters indicating that Nehru did not wish to accept nomination,\\"Mr. Nehru's Decision\\", The Times, 6 November 1950, p. 4. but as this decision had been communicated after the last date for withdrawal, a nominal election had to go ahead.\\"Two nominations for Nov. 10 election\\", The Times, 30 October 1950, p. 4.

The Kriegsmarine bombed the city of Almer√≠a in retaliation for a Republican air attack on the . Background In April 1937, the Non-intervention Committee established naval patrols in order to patrol the Spanish coasts and harbors. The naval patrols were furnished by Great Britain, France, Germany and Italy. The Spanish Republican Air Force carried out attacks against the harbor of Mallorca, a known-Nationalist naval base. On 24 May 1937, a Republican air raid hit the Italian cruiser , killing six Italian sailors and on the morning of 26 May another Republican air raid nearly missed the . The commander of the German naval patrol protested, nevertheless Mallorca was a patrol zone assigned to France and the foreign ships were inside Spanish territorial waters. The same day, two Republican bombers piloted by Russian pilots, attacked the German pocket battleship Deutschland at Ibiza, killing 20‚Äì23 German sailors and wounding 73. Hitler wanted to declare war on the Republic, but instead ordered the city of Almeria to be shelled. Bombing of Almeria At dawn on 31 May 1937, the German pocket battleship and four German destroyers attacked the city of Almeria. The German ships fired 200 shells at the town, killing 19-20 civilians, wounding 50 and destroying 35 buildings. Indalecio Prieto, the Republican minister of Defense wanted to attack the German fleet, but the president Manuel Aza√±a and the prime minister Juan Negrin were opposed to Prieto's plan because an open war against Germany might have brought the annihilation of the Republic. Negrin and Aza√±a sent protest notes to the secretary-general of the League of Nations and to the French and the British governments. However, the British and the French governments said that the German attack had been justified. Aftermath On 15 June, Germany denounced a supposed Spanish Republican Navy attack against the German cruiser , and on 23 June Germany and Italy withdrew from the Non-Intervention Committee and Portugal withdrew the British observers on its frontier. At the end of July the Italians started a campaign of maritime attacks against Republican and neutral merchant ships. The loss of merchant ships and the beginning of the Sino-Japanese war led the Soviets to reduce their aid to the Republic. By mid 1937 the Republic was virtually isolated.

The monastery was founded by Romanus of Condat, after whom it was named. It is entered on the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance. History Early Monastery The first monastery at Romainm√¥tier was built around 450 by Romanus of Condat. Romanus was born about 400 and died in 463 or 464. When he was thirty-five years old he went into the lonely region of Condat to live as a hermit, where after a while his younger brother Lupicinus followed him. A large number of scholars, among whom was Saint Eugendus, placed themselves under the direction of the two holy brothers who founded several monasteries including Romainm√¥tier (Romanum monasterium) in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland. Romanus was ordained a priest by Saint Hilary of Arles in 444, and with Lupicinus he directed these monasteries until his death. Two lives of him are in existence: one by Gregory of Tours in the \\"Liber vitae patrum\\", and an anonymous \\"Vita Sanctorum Romani, Lupicini, Eugendi\\". It is Gregory of Tours that gives the date of 450. Only a rhymed chronicle from the 13th century and the writings of Commissioner Aymonnet Pollen (1519) describe the founding of Romainm√¥tier Priory. Excavations carried out in 1905-15 discovered traces of a church dating from the 5th century, which confirmed this early date. In the 6th century, there is a record of an abbot Florianus who was abbas ex monasterio de Romeno, which is probably a reference to Romainm√¥tier. Second expansion The early monastery fell into disrepair and was rebuilt by Duke Chramnelenus. This rebuilt monastery was placed under the monastic rule of Saint Columbanus by 642. In 649 Saint Wandregisel, the future abbot of Fontenelle Abbey, visited Romainm√¥tier and found a thriving and diverse monastic life. The 5th-century church was enlarged and in the 7th century a second church was built with a rectangular choir. The second church was built on the south side of the first. Pope Stephen II visited the monastery in 753 while traveling for a meeting with Pepin the Short and according to tradition consecrated the churches of Saints Peter and Paul. In the 9th century Romainm√¥tier saw another period of decline. Lay abbots took possession of the monastery. In 888, the Guelph King Rudolf I of Burgundy gave the priory and its lands to his sister Adelheid or Adelaide, the wife of the Duke of Burgundy, Richard II. On 14 June 928/929, Adelaide gave the monastery and its lands to Cluny Abbey. However, for the monastery nothing changed because it remained a possession of the Burgundian royal family. During this period, the monastery was home to a community of Canons Regular rather than monks. At some point between 966 and 990, King Conrad of Burgundy finally renounced all his rights and gave the monastery to Abbot Maiolus of Cluny. Under Cluny Abbey, Romainm√¥tier Priory experienced its third golden age. The medieval monastery Abbot Odilo of Cluny, who resided more than once in Romainm√¥tier, had the present church built at the end of the 10th century. This church was modeled after the second church of Cluny Abbey (Cluny II). At the beginning of the 12th century, the church was modified by the construction of an ornate narthex and in the 13th century of a gatehouse. The last modifications were made to the church in 1445. The monastery church of Romainm√¥tier is one of the most important examples of Cluniac Romanesque art in Switzerland. While Odilo had managed Romainm√¥tier himself, his successors remained at Cluny Abbey and were represented by a prior. Until the end of the 12th century, this office was only granted for a limited number of years; later it became a lifetime appointment. In the 10th and 11th centuries, the monastery was fighting against aristocratic families of the region (Grandson, Salins) who were trying to expand their estates at the expense of the priory. These conflicts ended at the beginning of the 12th century. However, the pariage of 1181, in which Beatrix of Burgundy, the wife of Frederick Barbarossa, and the priory divided their rights, appears not to have been followed. Until the 14th century the priory was under Imperial protection. The lord of Les Cl√©es exercised oversight on behalf of his feudal lords, particularly the Savoys. The property of the priory included the territory around the monastery, which was known as La Pot√© (derived from the Latin word potestas), or Terre de Romainm√¥tier. By 1050, this property consisted of twelve villages. The priory also possessed land in Apples and in Bannans in Franche-Comt√©. They owned rights or smallholdings in 45 other locations. In the 12th century, small priories were established in Bursins, Mollens, Vufflens-la-Ville, Vallorbe and Lay- Damvautier to manage the far-flung holdings of Romainm√¥tier. The small priories had all become independent from Romainm√¥tier by the 14th century. The priories of Bevaix and Corcelles were affiliated with Romainm√¥tier in the 12th century, but until its secularization during the Protestant Reformation, they retained a certain independence. In the 11th century, they founded a hospital in Orbe, which operated until the mid-13th century. In the 11th century, the inhabitants of the Pot√© were still serfs, but in 1266 they were awarded a special legal status: they possessed personal freedom and were allowed to dispose freely of their goods, but were obliged to be faithful to the prior. If they moved outside the Pot√© or swore loyalty to another noble, they were expelled from the dominion and lost any items that they had been given by the priory. A familia grew up around the prior consisting of laity who worked for the priory. It included artisans (bakers, cooks, porters, clerk, etc.), officers who worked in the villages as administrators or as local police, and citizens of the city of Romainm√¥tier. Those of the familia class were not subject to compulsory service or collective work, but were required to pay the heriot or death tax. The early modern and modern monastery After a financial crisis in the 14th century, the monastery recovered and reached the height of its power at the end of the 14th and early 15th century. In the mid-15th century it passed into the secular hands of the Savoy dynasty and their associates. The income of the abbey became a source of personal income, and the monastic rules were less and less respected. When the Protestant Reformation arrived (1536), the monastery was already on the decline. In the 14th century about twenty monks still lived in the priory. By the 16th century it was about ten. Despite the protests of Fribourg, Bern secularized the priory on 27 January 1537. The priory church was now used for Reformed service, and the cloister was destroyed. The prior's house was converted into a castle for the Bernese Vogt, and the remaining buildings were rented or sold. Only some of the more distant properties escaped being taken by Bern. Some monks settled in Vaux-et-Chantegrue and created a simple countryside priory, which was abolished during the French Revolution. The priory buildings were restored in 1899‚Äì1915 and again in 1992‚Äì2000.

He was born in County Limerick, the second son of John Shaw of Willowbank, bacon merchant. The family firm (W. J. Shaw and Sons, Musgrave Street) was already thriving when he took it over, but under his astute management it grew to become one of the largest bacon curing businesses in Europe, and Shaw became one of the most prominent businessmen in the city.RIA Dictionary of Irish Biography, 2009 He was the President of the Limerick Chamber from 1899 to 1906. Golf Shaw was a keen sportsman and took part in rowing, rugby, athletics and hurling, but golf became his main interest. During the course of his business trips he often travelled to Scotland, where he became a passionate fan of the game. In 1891 he chaired a meeting in Limerick to discuss forming a golf club for the county. Land at Ballinacurra was procured and Limerick Golf Club was formed with Shaw as first president and captain. The club was based at several different locations before it finally settled at Ballyclough in 1919. He was appointed first trustee of the club in 1909.Patrick Cotter: The History of Limerick Golf Club 1891 - 1991 (1991) In 1892 Shaw \\"discovered\\" Lahinch and from then on devoted his spare time and energy to founding and promoting the Lahinch Golf Club.

The son of former Parramatta Eels premiership winger Neil Hunt and grandson of former South Sydney Rabbitohs player Jim Hunt, Justin previously played for the Rabbitohs, Eels and St. George Illawarra Dragons. He primarily plays as a and . Early career Born in Tweed Heads, Hunt grew up across the border on the Gold Coast, Queensland and played his first junior football for the Tugun Seahawks, where he represented the Queensland Country side. Hunt then moved to Sydney in 2008 to play in the inaugural season of the National Youth Competition with the Parramatta Eels. He played 3 games for the club before transferring mid season to the Wests Tigers, playing 4 games for them. From there, Hunt left the Tigers and played for a number of clubs in the following years. In 2009, he spent the season with the North Sydney Bears in the NSW Cup where his nickname was swiney before moving back to Queensland in 2010, to play for the North Queensland Cowboys feeder club, the Mackay Cutters in the Queensland Cup. He trained in the off-season with the Cowboys but was unable to get a start in the first grade side. In 2011, he signed for the Brisbane Broncos feeder side the Redcliffe Dolphins. Once again he trained with the first grade side but was unable to make his NRL debut. After a great season for the Dolphins, he and team mate Ryan Carr, signed one year contracts with the South Sydney Rabbitohs for the 2012 season. NRL career Hunt started the 2012 season playing for South Sydney's feeder team, the North Sydney Bears. After 2 months of great form with Norths, Hunt made his first grade debut for South Sydney on the wing, in their round 11 victory against the St. George Illawarra Dragons. He scored his first try a week later against the Canberra Raiders. In June 2012, he extended his contract at South Sydney for a further two seasons. He played in 10 games in 2012, scoring 5 tries. In August 2013 Hunt announced that he had signed with the Parramatta Eels. With South Sydney having a number of preferred first graders, Hunt decided it was time to return to the club where his father had starred in the 1980s. Hunt spent most of his playing time outside the NRL level with North Sydney. In total, Hunt made 51 appearances for Norths, scoring 38 tries and kicking 115 goals from 165 attempts finishing with a total of 388 points.http://www.ssralmanac.com/mobile/pastplayers_bears.htm Hunt made his debut for Parramatta in round 12 2014 against Penrith which ended in a 38-12 loss at Penrith Park. This would turn out to be the only appearance Hunt made for the Parramatta first grade side. In February 2015, Hunt gained a release from Parramatta to join the St George Illawarra Dragons on a one-year deal. In September 2016, Hunt was named on the interchange bench in the 2016 Intrust Super Premiership NSW Team of the Year.

As a child, he studied violin and showed an aptitude for composition. After graduating from high school in Potsdam, Zeller continued studies with violinist Felix Berger in Munich, and with composer Jean Paul Ertel, in Berlin. Zeller fought in the First World War. After being discharged from duty due to an injury, he made a living as a violinist with the Deutsches Opernhaus. Between 1921 and 1929 he was violinist and in-house composer for the Berlin Volksb√ºhne orchestra. Wolfgang Zeller died in Berlin in 1967. Film music His film music career was launched with the orchestral score he composed for The Adventures of Prince Achmed. The animated film created by Lotte Reiniger premiered in Berlin in 1926. The score for Walter Ruttmann's Melodie der Welt, the first full-length German sound film, followed in 1929. During the Third Reich, Zeller wrote music for propaganda films such as Jud S√º√ü (1940) directed by Veit Harlan. After the war, Mr. Zeller continued to work as a film composer and wrote music for anti-fascist films like Marriage in the Shadows (1947).

He was born in Halifax, Yorkshire and died at Stroud, Gloucestershire. A right-handed tail-end batsman and wicketkeeper, Rochford played for Yorkshire's second eleven in the Minor Counties Championship in 1951 before joining Gloucestershire for 1952. Unable to displace regular wicketkeeper Andy Wilson, who was a far better batsman, he played just two first-class games in 1952 and one in 1953, and made only eight appearances in 1954, when Wilson was 44. In 1955, however, Rochford took over as the regular wicketkeeper, playing in 30 matches and making 60 dismissals, and being awarded his county cap. His batting did not develop, however, and his highest score of the season was just 16 not out. There were a few signs of batting improvement in 1956 when, with 31 not out against Oxford University, Rochford made his highest score, and with Bryan Wells, Sam Cook and Francis McHugh in Gloucestershire's side, Rochford often batted far higher in the order than his batting talent warranted. He again made 60 dismissals in the season. After a few matches in 1957, he lost his place and with both Bobby Etheridge and Barrie Meyer available, he left the Gloucestershire staff at the end of the season. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1993 indicates that there was friction between Rochford and the Gloucestershire committee. From 1975 to 1977, Rochford was on the umpires' list for first-class and List A matches in England and Wales. He also coached cricket and was a writer and journalist on cricket too. He collapsed and died suddenly in a pub in Stroud, but was also suffering from cancer at the time.

It allows developers to increase the performance of their applications at the cost of writing more complex (lower-level) code. It provides the developer three primary tools: A simple 3D rendering API, a compute API similar to CUDA, and a C99-derived language.  History  RenderScript was added in Android 3.0 Honeycomb https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-3.0-highlights.html#graphics As of Android 4.1, Renderscipt's experimental 3D rendering API has been deprecated, and now exists solely as a compute API. Android 4.2 added new capabilities to script intrinsics, such as Blend and Blur; as well as ScriptGroups which allow you to chain together related RenderScript scripts and execute them with one call. Most recently, Google added FilterScript, which is a subset of RenderScript that allows developers to write their image processing operations in FilterScript using the standard RenderScript runtime API, but within stricter constraints that ensure wider compatibility and improved optimization across multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and DSPs. FilterScript is a less precise in terms of numeric datatype precision, and more cross device compatible subset of RenderScript - and should not be mistaken for a RenderScript replacement technology.  Features   Portability  RenderScript is designed to always run on the various Android platforms regardless of hardware type. Performance tuning is done at runtime. RenderScript portability depends upon device-specific drivers: a basic CPU- only driver is provided for every device, while there exist some specific chipset-provided RenderScript drivers that enable GPU usage (e.g. Qualcomm specific drivers, which are provided in the \`libRSDriver_adreno.so\` Android library).  Performance  RenderScript is designed to tune tasks at runtime that can be efficiently split and run concurrently on the underlying hardware.https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2011/03/renderscript.html As of Android 4.2, RenderScript has been expanded to run on the GPU in addition to the CPU on supported systems.  Limitations  * RenderScript cannot yet express on-chip inter-thread communication (known as local memory in OpenCL, and shared memory in CUDA). * RenderScript cannot yet express hardware-implemented 2D and 3D lookups with bilinear interpolation (known as texture in CUDA, and image read in OpenCL).

The son of With Pleasure is best remembered for his runner-up finishes in the 1958 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. Racing career Lincoln Road was owned by Chicago businessman Isaac Blumberg who raced the colt under the nom de course Sunny Blue Farm. Bloomberg and his trainer Vic Sovinski came back two years later to win the 1960 Kentucky Derby with Venetian Way. As a two-year-old, Lincoln Road broke his maiden in his third attempt and would win 2 of 7 starts. In 1958, at 3, he finished second seven times. In February, he placed second to Yemen in the Hutcheson Stakes at Gulfstream Park at seven furlongs. In April, he stretched out to a mile and one eighth and led most of the way but was caught at the wire and finished second again. This time he lost to Calumet Farm's Tim Tam in the Florida Derby, also at Gulfstream. Calumet Farm-owned Tim Tam went on to become a Dual Classic Winner and win divisional honors as the American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse. Next, in the Biscayne Bay Handicap, the favored Lincoln Road finished second to Belleau Chief, the same rival to whom he would finish third in the Stepping Stone Purse at Churchill Downs. Finishing fourth in that race was Silky Sullivan. On the first Saturday in May, Lincoln Road finished second again to Tim Tam in the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. Two weeks later, Lincoln Road was listed as the fourth choice in a field of twelve stakes-winning colts in the second jewel of the Triple Crown, the 83rd running of Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, on May 17, 1958. Derby winner Tim Tam was listed as even money, Jewel's Reward was 3:1, closer Silky Sullivan was third choice at 6:1, and Lincoln Road was listed at 8:1. Starting from post position ten, Lincoln Road broke well and set fast fractions on the lead of :23 flat, :46-2/5 and 1:11-3/5. He led by a half length rounding the clubhouse turn and then drew clear down the backstretch by two lengths. Around the final turn, he was heavily restrained by jockey C. Rogers but widened his lead to three lengths. In the stretch, Tim Tam bore down and won by one and a quarter lengths. Lincoln Road finished three and a half lengths in front of third-place finisher Gone Fishin. After his Triple Crown exploits, Lincoln Road would earn his stakes win with a front-running victory in the Jersey Derby over Talent Show. In his next start, he would lose in a photo to Terra Firma in the Stars And Stripes Handicap at Arlington Park in Chicago, Illinois. Never out of the money at three in 10 starts, his racing career was now over.

Establishment The scheme was established in 1974 by the Department of the Environment with much of the initial planning and implementation undertaken by the Water Research Centre. It involved the creation of a network of sites across the UK. Most sites were at the downstream freshwater limits of the larger rivers although some of the largest rivers also included additional locations below major tributary confluences. Before inclusion of any location in the survey, homogeneity testing was carried out to characterise quality variations laterally and vertically within the river section chosen. For each designated point a specific sampling location was identified based on the results of the homogeneity exercise. In addition laboratories who were to undertake the analysis of samples were identified and a comprehensive AQC exercise was conducted to ensure comparability of data derived from the monitoring programme.Analytical Quality Control in the Harmonised Monitoring Scheme Objectives The scheme was originally intended to operate for 10 years from 1974 to 1984 to provide date to the Department of the Environment to permit the identification of national trends in water quality.Co-ordination of analytical control for DOE Harmonised monitoring scheme It was also intended to satisfy the acquirements of the EU decision on the exchange of monitoring data requirements. Operation The scheme is administered by the Environment Agency in England, by Natural Resources Wales in Wales and by SEPA in Scotland and involves routine monitoring at 230 sites including 56 river systems in Scotland. Data The data produced by the scheme provides a continuous and consistent record of quality of rivers across the UK for more than 30 years and can be used to demonstrate changes in water quality over that period.

The webcomic centers on a group of teenagers who unwittingly bring about the end of the world through the installation of a beta copy of an upcoming computer game. Homestuck features a complex story and a large cast of characters, starring the four children John Egbert, Rose Lalonde, Dave Strider, and Jade Harley. Hussie invented an alien species, called trolls, that have a unique culture. Homestuck characters are particularly popular to cosplay at anime conventions. According to Lauren Rae Orsini writing for The Daily Dot, there existed 128 named characters in Homestuck in September 2012, with more still being introduced. The cast of Homestuck features a large quantity of LGBT characters, and a major theme of the webcomic is the multitude of characters that die throughout the story. Kids Each Homestuck character has their own icon; that of Jade is in the shape of her dog Becquerel's head The first few acts of Homestuck center around four 13-year-old children. Early pages of Homestuck were experiments in \\"fan-sourced storytelling\\", where Hussie allowed readers of Homestuck to name its characters and make story suggestions. The main characters of Homestuck were all named by fans. The four main characters are presented as Internet friends who have technically never met one another, but interact through an online chat application. ; John Egbert is the main protagonist of Homestuck and the first character that is introduced. He is portrayed as a loyal \\"leader\\" of the group of kids, despite also being described as a \\"stereotypical mischief-making teen.\\" Jokingly described by blogger Subdee as a \\"shoujo [sic] heroine\\", John's character is notably fond of bad films and has a seemingly irrational revulsion to the Betty Crocker brand. His weapon of choice is a hammer (strife specibus Hammerkind). Hussie confirmed on Twitter that John is a transgender woman who will go by the name of June. His classpect is Heir of Breath. ; Rose Lalonde is portrayed as an \\"intellectual\\", both through her obsession with Lovecraftian literature and through her organizing and planning the group's movement during the story. Aside from her interest in the occult, the character also enjoys knitting and uses her knitting needles as her go-to weapons (strife specibus Needlekind). Rose forms a relationship with, and marries in Act 7, the Troll Kanaya Maryam during the events of Homestuck. Her classpect is Seer of Light. ; Dave Strider is a boy \\"so cool he only appreciates things ironically.\\" He copied this behavior from his older brother(also his biological father through ectobiology and his only guardian), who he assumes collects puppets and katanas on an ironic level. Dave has been described as \\"smart-cynical,\\" and is John's best friend. Surrounded by bad video games and junk food, he wears aviator sunglasses, obscuring his eyes entirely, and wields katana in combat situations. He wields a sword (using the strife specibus Bladekind). His classpect is Knight of Time. Dave is the fictional creator of Hussie's spin- off webcomic Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff, in-jokes of which are featured frequently in Homestuck. Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff is intentionally poorly made, featuring unsteady lines, liberal use of the spray paint tool, and the unpopular typeface Comic Sans. ; First shown on-screen during Homestucks third act, Shaenon Garrity described Jade as \\"the most recalcitrant\\" of the four kids. Jade Harley lives on a remote island together with her dog, Becquerel, who is the First Guardian of Earth (later merging with him). As she can see the future through her dreams, Jade was the one who encouraged the other three kids to play the fictional video game Sburb, and therefore set the plot in motion. She often uses a hunting rifle(specibus Riflekind) in battle. Her classpect is Witch of Space, and being a space player, she creates the Genesis Frog of her session. Trolls zodiac signs, and each has a unique blood color from one another. In the fifth \\"act\\" of Homestuck, Hussie introduced an alien species called \\"trolls\\", based on Internet trolls, who live on the planet of Alternia in another dimension. While the first few acts of Homestuck focused on a more realistic theme of what it is like for a group of kids to be friends on the Internet, the trolls took on more explicit representations of facets of Internet culture. Hussie stated that each troll represents a kind of Internet behavior that is \\"marginalized or controversial, or something most people just want nothing to do with.\\" Homestuck aims to normalize and humanize internet cultures that are usually disfavored and rejected. Trolls chat with unique typing quirks, inserting clues concerning the speaker's identity in their chat patterns. For example, Vriska, a troll with spider-like attributes, replaces the letter 'B' with the number '8' and uses emoticons with eight eyes. Troll culture features a complex system of romance, featuring four \\"quadrants\\", that was specifically designed to encourage shipping among Homestuck fans. Homestuck trolls are by default bi- or pansexual; this normalization has been described by a fan as \\"incredible for all the bi and gay kids out there ... seeing loads of couples that don‚Äôt think twice about how they‚Äôre dating somebody of the same gender of themselves.\\" With few exceptions, all trolls fall on the hemospectrum, a caste system dictated by blood color and its corresponding attributes, such as lifespan, powers, personality, and rarity. Where burgundy-blooded trolls are common and fall at the bottom of the social hierarchy, fuchsia blood is exceptionally rare, and its carriers sit at the top of the hierarchy. Each troll also has an astrological sign, which carries their blood color and reflects their personality. The names of the twelve trolls were also suggested by Homestuck readers, but they were the last instance of user input, as Homestucks readership had expanded significantly at this point. In an interview with Comics Alliance, Hussie remembered how \\"the moment it went crazy was really unmistakable ... it was when I brought the trolls into the picture,\\" saying that Homestuck became a \\"contagious phenomenon\\" about halfway through the sub- arc introducing the characters. ; Portrayed as a powerful psychic, Aradia is responsible for recovering the code for the troll version of Sburb, Sgrub, from some ruins. She is a burgundy-blood, the lowest ranking blood color on the hemospectrum with the shortest lifespan of all trolls, but the most likely to have psychic powers. She used to enjoy archaeology, but has mysteriously lost interest in everything she used to enjoy. This happened on the night she lost her lusus (caretaker) and began to hear 'the voices of the dead' more clearly, and is eventually revealed to have made her a ghost. Equius makes her a robot body which she inhabits for a large part of the comic, and once that explodes, she is one of the only trolls to god-tier. Her astrological sign is Aries. Her classpect is Maid of Time. ; Tavros is a bronze-blood who deals with self-esteem issues throughout his character arc. He is shy and unassertive, and struggles with standing up for himself, especially to Vriska. He is shown to have an interest in fairy tales and fantasy stories, notably Pupa Pan, the Alternian equivalent of Peter Pan, and also has the ability to commune with animals. He uses a wheelchair after an encounter with Vriska, who has an unrequited crush on him, left him paralyzed, but he later gets robotic legs(although Vriska kills him directly afterwards). His astrological sign is Taurus. Tavros' ancestral figure, Rufioh, was inspired by the character Rufio from the 1991 film Hook. Dante Basco, who played Rufio in Hook, started reading Homestuck because his character made an appearance in it, and he later stated that Tavros is his favorite Homestuck character because of his relation to Rufioh. His classpect is Page of Breath. ; Sollux is a computer programmer whose personality is associated with ideas of duality. Sollux is a gold-blood, a caste known for great psychic power. He is the one who programs Sgrub(the troll version of Sburb) from the code Aradia found. Sollux has the ability to talk to the recently deceased, who inform him that Alternia will be annihilated. He also claims that he is destined to go blind before dying, a claim which later proves to be partially true(he has a whole half-dying thing that is never explained in detail). His introduction mirrors Dave's. His astrological sign is Gemini. His classpect is Mage of Doom. ; Karkat is the de facto leader of the trolls' group, with his introduction in Act 5 mirroring that of John at the start of the webcomic. He is quick to anger, loud, and often rude, but has a strong sense of justice, and is good at heart. His blood color is candy-red, which is considered a mutant color outside the hemospectrum, giving him an unshakable fear of persecution, causing him to be self-conscious and leading him to use a dull gray as not to reveal his true blood color. His astrological sign is Cancer. The name Karkat is a reference to \\"Karkata\\" the name of Cancer in the Hindu zodiac. It may also be a reference to the Hindi word \\"‡§ï‡§∞‡§ï‡§ü\\" meaning waste, a reference to his blood color. His classpect is Knight of Blood. ; Nepeta is an olive-blood, considered the \\"middle class\\" of the hemospectrum. She lives in a cave with her lusus, and is known for acting like a cat. She embodies an interest in both furries and shipping, a combination Hussie described as \\"for the sake of efficiency.\\" She is also Equius' moirail, or pacifying platonic soulmate, and has a crush on Karkat. Her astrological sign is Leo. The name Nepeta is a reference to the Genus name for the plant Catnip. In many North Germanic languages, Leijon translates to Lion. Her classpect is Rogue of Heart. ; Kanaya is a jade-blood. She has a great interest in fashion, and is thematically strongly influenced by the Virgin Mary, with her taking on a motherly role towards the other trolls, particularly Karkat. Over the course of the story, she eventually becomes a so-called \\"rainbow drinker\\", or vampire. Kanaya's romantic relationship with Rose Lalonde is one of the most popular canon same-sex relationships in the webcomic, commonly referred to as \\"Rosemary.\\" Her astrological sign is Virgo. The name Kanaya is a reference to \\"Kanya\\" the name of Virgo in the Hindu zodiac. Maryam is a reference to the Arabic form of Mary. Her classpect is Sylph of Space and, being the space player, she creates the genesis frog of her session. ; Terezi is the troll who guides Dave through the earlier acts of Homestuck. She is blind and able to visualize the world through her sense of smell and taste. She is teal-blooded and portrayed as an avid role-player and has a strong sense of justice. Her astrological sign is Libra. The name Terezi is a reference to the Albanian word \\"Terezi,\\" meaning \\"Justice.\\" Terezi was the first of three Homestuck characters to be introduced in Namco Bandai's dating simulator Namco High, of which Andrew Hussie was the creative director. Her classpect is Seer of Mind. ; A cosplayer portraying Vriska Vriska is cerulean-blooded and takes the role of an antihero in Homestuck. Being raised by a giant spider, Vriska uses a spider-themed typing quirk and aspires to be a pirate. Her weapon is a set of legendary eight-sided dice, which, depending on what they roll, can cause devastating attacks. Her astrological sign is Scorpio. The character is described as \\"ruthless, manipulative [and] powerful\\", and was considered among the \\"most hardcore\\" eyepatch-wearing fictional characters by The Mary Sue. Her classpect is Thief of Light. ; Equius is presented as an indigo-blooded robotics expert with an unnatural amount of strength. Despite his thorough belief in the hemospectrum, he has a borderline fetishistic adoration for Aradia Megido, who is of the lowest caste. He is Nepeta‚Äôs moirail, a companion who is seen as a platonic soulmate and helps pacify their more aggressive tendencies. His astrological sign is Sagittarius. His classpect is Heir of Void. ; Gamzee is a purple-blooded troll with strong ties to his religious faith, referred to as the \\"Cult of the Mirthful Messiahs\\". This religion is similar to that of the juggalo: he has an obsession with Faygo and believes firmly in miracles and the coming of the Dark Carnival. He is often high on Sopor Slime or possessed by other forces such as Lord English or his classpect. He is good friends with Karkat and Tavros and asks Tavros out once, but the page cuts off before Tavros could give a definitive answer. His astrological sign is Capricorn. His classpect is Bard of Rage. ; Eridan is shown as an aristocrat with a genocidal superiority complex. He claims he has a strong desire to kill all land-dwelling trolls and had commissioned a doomsday device from Vriska to that effect, but he never acts on any of this. He was obsessive over his former moirail Feferi which led to a toxic relationship, and when she couldn't handle keeping his anger in check and left him, he became so enraged that he killed both her and Kanaya(who tried to stop him), as well as almost killing Sollux. He is a violet-blood, making him part of the two castes that make up the seadwellers, a sub-race of trolls \\"distinct from the commoners by mutation and habitat\\", as it is put during his introduction. His astrological sign is Aquarius. The name Eridan is a reference to Eridanus, the river of life in Ancient Greek mythology. Ampora is derived from \\"amphora\\" which translates from Latin into \\"Beaker.\\" His classpect is Prince of Hope. ; Feferi is a seadweller like Eridan, as well as his former moirail. Feferi is the heir apparent for Alternian rulership, which puts her at risk from Her Imperious Condescension, the Empress of Alternia, who would make an attempt on her life if it weren't for her lusus'(a horrorterror-like beast who could destroy all life in the universe by uttering a noise) protection. She is fuchsia-blooded, the highest ranking blood caste, being that of royalty, but is shown to be much more passive than other high bloods, wanting to coddle low bloods rather than \\"cull\\" them, which is in some ways worse. Her astrological sign is Pisces. Other characters Cosplay of Porrim Maryam Other characters featured in Homestuck include another group of four kids (named Jane, Jake, Roxy, and Dirk), as well as another group of twelve trolls who are the pre-scratch versions of the original trolls' ancestors, the nearly-all-powerful antagonist Lord English, a \\"wayward vagabond\\" whose story is told in the Earth's post-apocalyptic future, and a pair of \\"diametrically opposed twins living inside the same body\\" named Calliope and Caliborn (the latter of which becomes Lord English). Andrew Hussie also inserted himself into Homestucks story as a character, where he offers detailed summaries and ends up in \\"bizarre in-world encounters.\\" After Ryan North asked why \\"MS Paint Adventures\\" doesn't follow the adventures of a \\"Ms. Paint\\", Hussie included a minor character to Homestuck with that name. Late in the webcomic, Hussie introduced Davepetasprite^2, a fusion of the characters of Davesprite (an apparitional alternate timeline version of Dave) and Nepeta Leijon. The character is notable for having had a short-lived crisis with regards to their gender identity, but was quickly defined as non- binary. Analysis According to Lilian Min of The Atlantic, Homestucks greatest strength is Andrew Hussie's \\"gift for character-building\\", and that the characters are unique and \\"strangely relatable\\". Elliott Dunstan of Monkeys Fighting Robots said, \\"the sheer number of characters and possible interactions can get overwhelming\\", and that each fan ends up with a favorite cast member. The characters of Homestuck are particularly popular among cosplayers, with cosplay events such as San Diegostuck being held for Homestuck cosplay specifically. Mary Kinney of New York University wrote that Homestuck, which is heavily stylized as an adventure game, features an \\"implied character\\" as the player. This \\"nebulous\\" actor changes the Homestuck world. For example, on the first page of the webcomic, the player is prompted to enter the protagonist's name. After clicking to go to the following page, the reader's sense of control dissipates as they are not actually allowed to enter a name. The relationship between the player and the reader of the story fluctuates from page to page, and the player character may switch from avatar to avatar. In this way, the reader experiences Homestucks narrative through the experiences of various characters. In an interview with The Daily Dot, Homestuck guest artist Shelby Cragg praised Hussie's webcomic for its 50:50 gender ratio and large number of well-written female characters. Creatrix Tiara of Autostraddle noted that Hussie was highly successful with creating a diverse LGBT cast, by writing the characters in a \\"realistic, non-fetishistic manner.\\" A large number of LGBT readers have claimed to have been strongly affected by the representation of diverse sexualities and gender identities in the webcomic. Characters and death Characters frequently die within the plot of Homestuck, which Andrew Hussie described as a necessity of a story with such a large cast. Though Hussie used death as \\"the line between relevance and irrelevance\\", characters generally remain relevant in some way in the story, as there exist various video game-style constructs that allow a character to be revived. Rebecca Peterson of The Martlet described how \\"characters are gleefully killed off, brought back, and killed again\\" in a manner that makes it difficult to follow which characters are still alive. Characters may even have multiple versions of themselves active in the story simultaneously, both dead and alive. In an interview with Big Shiny Robot, Hussie said the following on this topic: Death is presented as a \\"leveling up step\\" for the characters in Homestuck, it being the only way for characters to gain God Tier powers. According to Autostraddle, many characters reach a greater importance after their death, as they can contribute to the story as ghosts or helper sprites. Some readers of the webcomic see this implementation of death as a subversion of the \\"bury your gays\\" trope, as homosexual characters frequently get killed off in American media.

In December he was contacted by the New York Nets, in the middle of a disastrous first season in the NBA following the ABA‚ÄìNBA merger. The Nets had been left short at the guard position following the sale of superstar Julius Erving due to financial difficulties. Hawkins quickly became the closest thing the Nets had to a star, averaging 19.3 points per game and leading Nets head coach Kevin Loughery to remark \\"All I know is that Bubbles Hawkins has become a hero just when we needed one.\\"Hannon, Kent (March 7, 1977) Nets Sink, Bubbles Rises Sports Illustrated.

The sporocarps (fruit bodies) are watery white and gelatinous with small, white, mineral inclusions. It is a common, wood-rotting species in Europe and North America, typically growing on dead attached or fallen branches of broadleaf trees. Taxonomy History The species was originally described by Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wallroth in 1833, who found it growing on hawthorn in Germany. He placed it in his new genus Myxarium based on its visible white inclusions which he interpreted as spores. Wallroth noted its similarity to Naematelia nucleata, but nonetheless described Myxarium nucleatum as a new species, using the same epithet. Lewis David von Schweinitz had previously described Tremella nucleata from the United States, a species that was later transferred to the genus Exidia by Burt. Many subsequent publications, summarized by Donk (1966) and Reid (1970), have discussed whether the European Myxarium nucleatum is conspecific with the American Exidia nucleata. The consensus now seems to be that they are the same species, but this is based on morphological similarity not on comparing DNA sequences. Donk preferred the name Myxarium hyalinum (based on Tremella hyalina Pers.) for this species, but most later authors have followed Reid in considering Tremella hyalina a nomen dubium (name of uncertain application) that might originally have referred to any whitish or transparent jelly fungus. Persoon had made no mention of white inclusions when originally describing the species. Current status The species is still frequently referred to the genus Exidia, but molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, has indicated that it belongs in a Myxarium clade that is quite separate from the Exidia clade. English names Its recommended English name in the UK is \\"crystal brain\\"; in North America it has also been called \\"granular jelly roll\\". Description Myxarium nucleatum forms scattered, pustular, gelatinous fruit bodies in diameter. These often coalesce, forming compound fruit bodies that may be irregularly cerebriform (brain-like) and up to 6 cm (2.5 in) across. Fruit bodies are hyaline (colourless) to whitish, occasionally with lilac or pinkish tints. Opaque, white, spherical, mineral inclusions are often evident and are made of calcium oxalate. The spore-bearing surface (hymenium) is smooth. With age, the fruit bodies may become brownish and eventually dry to a thin, varnish-like film. The spore print is white. The fungus does not have any distinct taste or smell; it is inedible. Microscopic characters The basidia are ellipsoid, longitudinally septate, and measure 11‚Äì16 x 9‚Äì10.5 ¬µm, with a stalk cell up to 28 ¬µm long that becomes enucleate on maturity. The spores are allantoid (sausage-shaped), measuring 8.5‚Äì14 x 3.5‚Äì5 ¬µm. Hyphae are produced in a gelatinous matrix and are clamped, hyaline, and 1.5 to 2.5 ¬µm wide. Similar species Exidia thuretiana is a lookalike species. Fruit bodies of Exidia thuretiana are similarly coloured, but are typically more opaque and often appear pleated. They do not (or very rarely) contain white, granular inclusions. Microscopically, E. thuretiana can be distinguished by its sessile (not stalked) basidia. Fruit bodies of several gelatinous Tremella species may also appear similar, but never contain granular inclusions. All can be distinguished microscopically by their non-allantoid spores. Habitat, distribution, and ecology Myxarium nucleatum is often found in association with old pyrenomycetes, but is presumed to be a wood-rotting species, typically found on dead attached or fallen branches. It was originally recorded on hawthorn, but is also known from many other broadleaf trees and shrubs, including beech, ash, sycamore, and ivy. Myxarium nucleatum typically fruits in autumn and winter. It is widely distributed in Europe, North, Central and South America, and New Zealand. The fruit bodies can serve as host to the auricularioid parasite Zygogloea gemellipara. This fungus grows thin thread-like hyphae‚Äîtoo small to be viewed with the naked eye‚Äîon the hymenium of its host. The hyphae of the parasite attach to the host hyphae through twisting, tendril-like haustorial cells.

Early activism  In 1960, Wittman entered Swarthmore College where he became a student activist. Wittman spent summers doing civil rights work in the South, and joined the national council of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). In 1966, after becoming disillusioned with homophobia in the New Left, Wittman left SDS. Wittman married Mimi Feingold the same year. In 1967, Wittman moved to San Francisco with Feingold where they lived with other activists in an anti-draft commune. Wittman turned in his draft card to the Oakland Induction Center in October 1967 during Stop the Draft Week.  Gay activism  Wittman, while self- identified as gay since the age of 14, remained closeted until coming out in the late 1960s in an article, \\"Waves of Resistance,\\" published in the November, 1968 issue of the antiwar magazine, Liberation.Wittman, Carl.

Two years later, he began a long-term relationship with a fellow war resister, Allan Troxler, a conscientious objector. In the early 1980s, Wittman created the North Carolina Lesbian and Gay Health Project (LGHP) with David Jolly, Timmer McBride, and Aida Wakil to address the health needs of sexual minorities in that state.Lekus, Ian K. \\"Health care, the AIDS crisis, and the politics of community: The North Carolina Lesbian and Gay Health Project, 1982-1996.\\" Modern American Queer History Allida Black (ed).

Instrumental figure in country dance  \\"Carl Wittman, led the development in the United States of a movement diametrically opposed to Kennedy's couples policy: \\"gender-free\\" dance in which there were no gendered dance roles\\" (page 205, of Walkowitz' City Folk). Carl Wittman, a certified RSCDS (Royal Scottish Country Dance Society) instructor, started teaching Scottish country dancing in the San Francisco area about 1970. Carl was very involved in the gay political movements of that era. In the early 1970s, Carl left San Francisco and traveled up the coast to the artist's community of Wolf Creek, Oregon and eventually settled in Golden, Oregon with his partner, Allan Troxler. Carl became involved in the newly emerging intentional communities of gay men and lesbians in that area. He started a local community dance in his barn in Golden, Oregon, where he pulled in people from these intentional communities, as well as families and friends from around the area. His dancing community ended up being a mixture of families, gay men, lesbians and friends. Carl taught English and Scottish country dancing, at first, in the tradition and style in which he had learned, identifying dancers by their gender role and using gender language. He allowed anyone to dance with whomever they wished and in any role they chose, but he used the conventional gender terminology to identify these roles. Sometime thereafter, Allan challenged Carl to change this convention, and come up with something that was more appropriate for their community. Carl changed his role identification system to \\"Reds\\" and \\"Greens\\" (Reds identifying the traditional gent's position and Greens to identify the lady's position). He went on to further develop this to a method defined as \\"Left File\\" and \\"Right File\\" dancers (the left file identifying the traditional gent's role and the right file identifying the traditional ladies position). Over time, Carl started traveling around Oregon, starting other dance communities, teaching this style of English and Scottish Country Dancing. Carl developed another tradition during this time, that being of how to line up for each dance. He advocated that everyone come to the set individually and fill in the next available space. This method ensures that everyone will have someone to dance with and addressed the sometimes-awkward practice of asking someone to dance, particularly with folks new to the dance. This method has also been adopted by the Boston gender-free English country dance community with an additional note that if you desire to dance with a particular partner, wait until all spaces in the set are filled above you before coming to the set. Carl was also the dance leader and principal choreographer for the Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon in 1980.http://lcfd.org/Articles/GFManual/GF-Manual.pdf  Posthumous recognition  Carl Wittman was recognized as a Main Honoree by the Sesquicentennial Honors Commission at the Durham 150 Closing Ceremony in Durham, NC on November 2, 2019.

Four men and their families, some affiliated with Northcote Rugby, met with the then secretary of the Auckland Rugby Union, Link Warren. History With the support of the Auckland Rugby Union, a new club (under the umbrella of Northcote Rugby Union headed by Snow White) was formed known as the Glenfield Rugby Football Club (now known as Glenfield Rugby Union and Sports Club Inc.).http://www.glenfieldrugby.co.nz The original club was located on Archers Road, currently home to the Glenfield Rovers Football club. Two or three years would pass before the North Shore City Council would provide new grounds to the club being constructed out of strawberry fields at Kaipatiki Road. Glenfield Rugby club was awarded senior status by the Auckland Rugby Union in 1973. From 1974 to 1984 Glenfield fielded a senior team in the Auckland Rugby Union third division. The Glenfield Grizzlies Presidents grade side was also formed in 1975 by club stalwarts Glen \\"Bungy\\" Williams, Ken Cooksley, the late Ted Wilson, and the late Roy Doddrell. In 1985 the Glenfield Grizzlies team had the honour of playing at Twickenham in London, England. Glenfield club members refer to it as \\"the game that made Twickenham famous\\". From 1985 to 2019, Glenfield has played in the Senior A division of the North Harbour Club rugby competition. Since 2019, Glenfield now only fields a team in the North Harbour Senior Reserves competition. In 1986, Mark Hellyer was the first provincial player to be selected from Glenfield to play for the newly formed North Harbour Rugby Union. In 1987 Glenfield changed their colours from rust jerseys and blacks shorts to Red and White jerseys with black shorts. Glenfield now plays in red, black and white hoops (colours similar to Counties Manukau NPC). In 1989 Walter Little was the first All Black to be selected from the Glenfield club. Little went onto play for the New Zealand All Blacks from 1989 to 1998. Walter played 55 tests for the All Blacks. Walter Little also shares the record for most games played (147 games) for North Harbour alongside Ron Williams who played for the Northcote club. Walter's son Michael also represented Harbour from the Glenfield club and now plays his rugby in Japan. Michael was the second father son combination to be selected for Harbour alongside Frano and Jacob Botica from the North Shore club. Glenfield has been North Harbour Senior A club rugby runners up twice 2000 and 2006. Glenfield has won 2 Under 21 Championships, 1987 and 2008. Glenfield has also won a Senior C Championship in 1992 when they defeated Northcote at Onewa Domain. Mark Hellyer (Glenfield Premiers 1981‚Äì1996) still holds the record for most Senior games played for Glenfield with 243 games.

Rivalries with other rugby clubs  Though overshadowed by the success of their neighbouring clubs such as Northcote, Takapuna and East Coast Bays Glenfield has good rivalries with their neighbours, in particular the Northcote‚ÄìBirkenhead Rugby club. Glenfield v Northcote Glenfield verses Northcote has always been classed as a friendly and respectful rivalry between the 2 clubs. Northcote were instrumental in helping to start the Glenfield club as a junior feeder club in 1969. To many this rivalry would be seen as a \\"Derby of contrasts\\", as Northcote have established themselves as a North Harbour club rugby powerhouse winning numerous titles across all grades. Glenfield and Northcote have met in 3 Under 21 Championship finals (1987, 2002, 2003) with Glenfield winning in 1987, and Northcote winning in 2002 and 2003. Glenfield and Northcote have also met in 3 Senior C finals between in 1990, 1991, 1992 with Northcote winning in 1990, 1991 and Glenfield winning in 1992. The North Harbour Senior C competition trophy is named the Ted Wilson Cup after the late Glenfield rugby club stalwart and GRFC Life member Ted Wilson. Glenfield v North Shore The Frazer King Memorial trophy is played for between Glenfield and North Shore. Frazer was a North Harbour referee who passed away suddenly whilst refereeing a premier game between Glenfield and North Shore at Devonport Domain in 1985. Glenfield v Marist North Harbour The Birkenhead Transport has been played for between Glenfield and Marist North Harbour since 1989. The fact Glenfield and Marist are yet to win a North Harbour Premiership adds a lot of intense rivalry and colour to the games between the 2 clubs. The often games are often very close in scorelines between the 2 teams. Glenfield v Mahurangi When Mahurangi RFC joined the Harbour club comp in 1989, Glenfield was their first game. This is classed as a traditional game for Mahurangi as Glenfield is the first club they played in the Harbour club competition. Glenfield v Takapuna Glenfield v Takapuna is one of North Harbour rugby's many suburban rivalries. Though when it comes to success both clubs are at opposite ends of the scale. Takapuna is by far the most successful North Harbour club winning 12 Harbour premierships. In the Auckland club comp days Takapuna was a regular team in the Auckland top division winning 2 Gallaher shields, where as Glenfield played in the Auckland third division and were often on the end of some rather unflattering scorelines.Glenfield has met Takapuna 2 times in the North Harbour premiership final with Takapuna winning both times (2000 and 2006). Glenfield ended Takapuna's famous 2 year winning streak in 2001. Glenfield beat Takapuna in 2015, a game which was also Jeremy Hikuroa's 200th game for the Glenfield Premiers. Glenfield v Waitakere City Glenfield plays an annual pre‚Äìseason fixture each year with Auckland club Waitakere City.

Some time in the early 1770s, Melmoth entered into a marital-like relationship with a clergyman, Samuel Jackson Pratt, who, as a result of the scandal, left the church to pursue an ultimately unsuccessful acting career and who eventually became a well-known writer. According to A History of The City of Brooklyn, Melmoth \\"had been duped into a sham marriage, while at boarding school, by a Mr. Pratt (known in the literary and theatrical circles of that day as Courtney Melmoth), and with him went upon the stage, playing in several companies both in England and Ireland.\\" Pratt's parents strongly disapproved of the relationship and it is not known whether or not the marriage was ever legally formalised. The couple toured together in theatrical productions, not always successfully, and sometimes had to resort to telling fortunes to make their living. In 1773 the couple opened a theatre in Drogheda, County Louth, Ireland. The venture was not successful and the theatre failed within three months,A Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians (Vol 10) whereupon the couple moved to London, where Melmoth began to achieve success as an actress, both at Covent Garden and Drury Lane. From 1776 to 1779 the couple played seasons in Edinburgh, London and Birmimgham. Friendship with Benjamin Franklin From 1777 to 1778, the couple were in Paris, where they made the acquaintance of Benjamin Franklin.The Franklin Papers ‚Äì \\"Courtney Melmoth\\" The couple were present in January 1778 when Franklin gave a copy of his portrait to a certain Mrs Izard, but neglected to give a similar copy to Melmoth. The incident inspired Melmoth to write a poem, \\"Impromptu, To Doctor Franklin For the Author who was present when he gave his Portrait to a Lady\\", which Pratt sent to Franklin.The Franklin Papers: 28 January 1778 (s): letter from Pratt to Franklin enclosing copy of Charlotte's poem. Franklin replied, apologising for not realising that Melmoth also wanted a copy of the portrait.The Franklin Papers: 28 January 1778 (r): Benjamin Franklin's response to Charlotte's poem. The couple were by now experiencing serious financial problems, (Pratt had already borrowed money from a friend, Mrs Montagu and attempted to borrow money from Samuel Johnson) and, on 29 January 1778, the day after receiving Franklin's response to Melmoth's poem, Pratt wrote to Franklin asking to borrow money from him, which Franklin agreed to.The Franklin papers: 29 January 1778 Pratt's first request for a loan He then asked for a further loan four days laterThe Franklin papers: 4 February 1778 and, on 3 March begged Franklin for \\"a small allowance by week or month, in order to assist my slender Circumstances\\".The Franklin Papers 3 March 1778 A further request for money was made on 12 May,The Franklin Papers 12 May 1778 shortly before the \\"Melmoths\\" returned to England, to which Franklin replied that he found the requests for money \\"a greater inconvenience to myself than you perhaps imagined\\", but agreeing to the further loan, relying \\"on your Honour and Punctuality for the speedy Repayment\\". On 22 June 1778 Pratt wrote to Franklin from London regretting that he and Melmoth were unable to repay the money,The Franklin Papers 22 June 1778 whereupon the friendship with Franklin appears to have abruptly ended. By 1781 Pratt and Melmoth had separated, and Melmoth, retaining her 'married' surname, continued her acting career in Ireland. In 1793 she emigrated to the United States. Acting career In Britain and Ireland Charlotte Melmoth as Queen Elizabeth in \\"The Earl of Essex\\" 1779. Melmoth made her stage debut in May 1773 at The Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, playing Monimia in \\"The Orphan\\". In late 1773 Melmoth and Pratt opened their own theatre in Drogheda, with a production of \\"The Merchant of Venice\\", in which Melmoth played Portia to Pratt's Shylock, but the theatre failed and, after three months, the couple moved to London. In February 1774 she debuted at Covent Garden as Calista in \\"The Fair Penitent\\". Westminster Magazine reviewed her performance with the words, \\"Her figure is pleasing and also she is young and handsome ... she possesses the internal as well as external requisites of a good actress; for she discovers great feeling and sensibility; and indeed promises to be a great ornament to the theatre\\". Later that year, also at Covent Garden, she played Roxana in Nathaniel Lee's \\"The Rival Queens or The Death of Alexander The Great\\", a role she would reprise at other times in her career. Amongst other roles she played at Covent Garden that season are Eleanor in \\"Henry II\\", Hermione in \\"A Winter's Tale\\" and Queen Elizabeth in Henry Jones' tragedy, \\"The Earl of Essex\\". In 1776 she played Edinburgh with her husband, where, among many other leading roles, she played Alicia in \\"The Tragedy of Jane Shore\\", Viola in \\"Twelfth Night\\" and Mrs Belville in \\"School for Wives\\". In Edinburgh she also played Lady Macbeth for the first time ‚Äì a role for which she would eventually become famous.Companion to the American Theatre In November 1776 she made her debut at Drury Lane as Lady Macbeth and the following February, reprised her role as Roxanne in \\"The Rival Queens\\", alongside Mary Robinson.Memoirs of Mary Robinson This would be her last appearance in London; the following year she and her husband were in Paris, then in 1778 and 1779 they played two seasons in Edinburgh, where Melmoth began to add Comic parts (including Lady Sneerwell in \\"The School for Scandal\\") to her previously Tragic repertoire. In late 1779, after a season in Birmingham, Melmoth's success seems to have faded for a while, and the couple travelled Britain seeking work, occasionally telling fortunes for a living. By 1780 the couple had returned to where Melmoth's acting career had started ‚Äì the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin. They made their final appearance there as a couple in 1781, after which they separated and never met again. Melmoth toured the major cities of Ireland, playing in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Derry and Belfast, eventually settling in Dublin. She played Smock Alley from 1782 to 1783, was the 'prima donna' of Leoni's Capel Street Theatre |Capel Street Opera House from 1783 to 1784, Owensons Fishamble Street Theatre from 1784 to 1785, returned to Smock Alley from 1785 to 1788, finally ending her Irish stage career at the Crow Street Theatre from 1788 to 1789.John Green: \\"Theatre in Belfast 1736‚Äì1800\\" According to \\"The Thespian Dictionary\\", Melmoth converted to Roman Catholicism in 1786, shortly prior to her Benefit Performance in Dublin; the Dictionary suggests her motives were purely mercenary ‚Äì increased ticket sales in a Catholic city ‚Äì but most biographers believe her conversion to be sincere.\\"The Thespian Dictionary\\" ‚Äì Charlotte Melmoth In July 1789 Melmoth announced her retirement from the theatre to open a school teaching filigree work to ladies, but the school was not a success and in 1793 Melmoth emigrated to America to resume her interrupted stage career. In America  Arriving in New York in March 1793, Melmoth (advertised as 'From the Theatres Royal of London and Dublin') gave a series of recitations and Shakespearian monologues, held at Corre's Hotel throughout that April. The London Register reported that the event \\"afforded infinite delight to every rational mind\\". Later that year she joined Hodgkinson's 'American Company' at the John Street Theatre, New York, making her debut on 20 November 1793 as Euphrasia in Arthur Murphy's The Grecian Daughter. Over the next five years she was to play many leading tragic roles for that company, including her most famous role as Lady Macbeth, becoming a 'universal favourite' for the excellence of her acting. She was acclaimed by leading American impresario, William Dunlap, as \\"the best tragic actress the inhabitants of New York, then living, had ever seen,\\" and William Wood wrote of her \\"To a fine face and powerful voice she added an exquisite feeling of the pathetic which...left an impression which years fail to efface.\\" In 1794 she refused to speak the Epilogue of a new opera, \\"Tammanay\\" by Ann Hatton, apparently disapproving of its patriotic sentiments. The New York Journal demanded a boycott of Melmoth's performances and called for her not to be \\"suffered to go on the New York stage again.\\" Nevertheless, her popularity was undiminished and when the Park Theatre, New York, opened in 1798 Melmoth became one of its leading actresses. Unfortunately, Melmoth, still playing youthful parts in her late-40s was no longer in the prime of life, and her figure had grown bulky ‚Äì \\"far beyond the sphere of embonpoint\\" as Dunlap commented. She had grown so large that, playing Euphrasia one night she invited another character to stab her, crying, as per the script, \\"Strike here! Here's blood enough!\\" at which the audience burst out laughing ‚Äì she cut the line from all further performances. Finally becoming aware of the limitations of her size, she took to playing older \\"matron\\" parts instead, at which she apparently excelled. She stayed with the Park Theatre until 1805, when she moved to the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. In 1811 she was travelling to fulfil an engagement at the Olympic Theatre, New York, when she was involved in a carriage accident, resulting in a severe fracture to her arm (although rumours that she had been killed were circulating in the press). The fracture failed to heal properly and Melmoth reluctantly had to give up her acting career. On 12 August 1812, after announcing her retirement from the stage, Melmoth gave her last performance ‚Äì a 'benefit performance' to raise funds for her retirement ‚Äì playing Fiammetta in The Tale of Mystery at the Olympic Theatre, New York. Later life Following her 1812 retirement, Melmoth supported herself on the proceeds of a 'respectable tavern' which she had already purchased while still acting, and opened a school for elocution in Washington Street, New York. Later she purchased a cottage in Red Hook Lane, Brooklyn (on present-day Carroll Street) where she established a boarding house and a school which she ran until her death. Her pupils included children from some of the wealthiest and best-known Brooklyn families, including the Cornell, Pierpoint, Cutting, Jackson and Luquer families. She died, aged 74, on 28 September 1823 and was buried in the Catholic graveyard surrounding the original St. Patrick's Cathedral on Mott and Prince streets in Manhattan. The Washington Quarterly obituary said of her \\"her talent, particularly in the higher walks of tragedy, was very generally acknowledged. She was much esteemed for her excellent private character.\\"The Washington Quarterly 1824  References   External links  * Gay Smith, (2010) \\"Lady Macbeth in America: From the Stage to the White House,\\" (New York: Palgrave Macmillan), Chapter on Charlotte Melmoth * The Cambridge Guide to the American Theatre * A Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians (Vol 10) on Google Books * John Green: \\"Theatre in Belfast 1736‚Äì1800\\" * A History of the City of Brooklyn.

He's been active since 1980 but only recently obtained a discrete attention in the music scene. Biography He started in 1980 participating in various radio show (in particular Italian channels ‚Äò‚ÄôRai 2‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚ÄôRai 3‚Äô‚Äô), but his main passion was the music, which he regards as the main means of expression. He found inspiration in artists like Alice Cooper, David Bowie and Black Sabbath. In 1980 he released his first self-produced album, called Perseo Miranda and His Theatre, and the following year the CD single \\"I sayd I look away\\". Then Miranda devoted himself to teaching guitar in various schools, recording some vocals in many pop rock albums and playing in many different bands (from hard rock to heavy metal, punk, gothic metal, blues and other generes). He returned to the music scene in 2006, releasing the album Light and Darkness Some Italian webzines, as Metallized.it, described it as a \\"classic heavy metal album with strong dark and gothic influences\\". In 2007 Miranda released the album Evolution of the spirits and in 2008 Parallel Dimensions. The last one had some good reviews: Italian webzine OndaAlternativa noted some changes in the style, moving from gothic metal to a kind of \\"trash-prog metal\\",.Powermetal.it described this work as hard rock music with modern ideas, especially in the guitar work. In 2010 Miranda signed for the Italian label Erga Edition. Praise my day was the first Miranda's album produced by Erga Edition. This album gained attention from some Italian magazines. Rock Hard said that \\"Miranda is one of the few artists that really sings and interprets in different ways, depending from the song atmosphere\\". Under the same label Miranda released in 2011 the single CD (2 tracks) A silence that screams-In a Broken dreams, and some months later the CD A Silence That Screams. Some reviews such as Italia di Metallo judicated it as a pure heavy metal work with dark and progressive episodes. Metal Maniac magazine judicated it as a hard and complex album, with hard rock-heavy metal songs, but also progressive sounds. The title track \\"A Silence That Screams\\", was also included in the Inferno Sounds compilation, attached to Inferno Rock magazine. Other projects Miranda wrote 2 books in the field of astrology: Manuale di astrologia (translated Astrology Manual) (2001‚Äì Erga Editions) and Gli astri dicono (translated Aster says (2003 ‚Äì Erga Editions).

It was inhabited by the Germanic tribes of Marcomanni and Quadi, and lay in the western parts of the modern states and Slovakia and the Czech Republic (Moravia). Part of the area was occupied by the Romans under Marcus Aurelius between 174 AD and 180 AD. His successors abandoned the project, but the people of the area became steadily Romanized during the next two centuries. The Roman influence was disrupted with the invasions of Attila starting around 434 AD and as Slavic people later began to move into the area. Characteristics After the creation of the fortified limes on the Danube river, the Roman Empire tried to expand in central Europe, mainly during the emperor Marcus Aurelius's rule in the second century. It was an initiative that resulted in an ephemeral conquest of the Germanic tribes living in present-day western Slovakia, the Quadi and the Marcomanni, during the so- called Marcomannic Wars. Under Augustus, the Romans and their armies initially occupied only a thin strip of the right bank of the Danube and a very small part of south-western Slovakia (Celemantia, Gerulata, Dev√≠n Castle). Tiberius wanted to conquer all Germania up to the Elbe river and in 6 AD dispatched a military expedition from the fort of Carnuntum to Mu≈°ov and beyond,Roman army in the Czech Republic (in Czech) but was forced to stop the conquest because of a revolt in Pannonia. Only in 174 AD did the emperor Marcus Aurelius penetrate deeper into the river valleys of the V√°h, Nitra and Hron, where there are some Roman marching camps like Laugaricio.Map with Roman fortifications (in german) On the banks of the Hron he wrote his philosophical work Meditations The small Roman forts of Zavod and Suchohrad on the Morava river show an intention of penetrating toward northern Bohemia-MoraviaRoman marching camps in Bohemia-Moravia and the Oder river (and perhaps southern Poland Marching or temporary camps of Roman troops in western Slovakia and eastern Moravia). The latest archaeological discoveries which have located new Roman enclosures in the surroundings of Brno led to the conclusion that the advance of Roman troops from Carnuntum could have run further to the north- east, into the region of the Polish-Slovak border. Indeed, recent archaeological excavations and aerial surveying have shown further locations in northeast Moravia: three temporary Roman camps (possibly connected to the Laugaricio fort) situated in the foreland of the so-called Moravian Gate (Olomouc-Ne≈ôed√≠n, Hul√≠n-Pravƒçice, Osek) have been partly corroborated, the former two clearly by digging.Moravian Gate Map Marcus Aurelius wanted to create a new Roman province called Marcomannia in those conquered territories, but his death put an end to the project. His successors abandoned these territories, but ‚Äì with the exception of Valentinian I ‚Äì maintained a relatively friendly relationship with the barbarians living there (who enjoyed a degree of \\"cultural Romanization\\" that can be seen in some buildings around present-day Bratislava in StupavaStupava (in Slovak)). Indeed, the Romanization of the barbarian population continued into the late Roman period (181-380 AD). Many Roman buildings (with plenty of trade evidence of Roman civilization) appeared on the territory of south-western Slovakia (Bratislava - D√∫bravka, C√≠fer - P√°c, Veƒæk√Ω K√ΩrTerra sigillata) in the relatively peaceful period of the 3rd and 4th centuries. These were probably residences of the pro-Roman Quadian (and maybe Marcomannic) aristocracy. Romans in the late fourth century were able to bring Christianity into the area: the Germanic population of the Marcomanni converted when Fritigil, their queen, met a Christian traveller from the Roman Empire shortly before 397 AD. He talked to her of Ambrose, the formidable bishop of Milan (Italy). Impressed by what she heard, the queen converted to Christianity.M√≥csy 1974, p. 345.Todd 2004, p. 119. In the Roman ruins of Dev√≠n Castle, the first Christian church located north of the Danube has been identified, probably built in the early fifth century. A few years later Attila devastated the area and started the mass migrations that destroyed the Western Roman Empire. Meanwhile, the area was beginning to be occupied by Slavic tribes. Indeed, the first written source suggesting that Slavic tribes established themselves in what is now Slovakia is connected to the migration of the Germanic Heruli from the Middle Danube region towards Scandinavia in 512.Heather 2010, pp. 407-408.Barford 2001, p. 53. In that year, according to Procopius, they first passed \\"through the land of the Slavs\\", most probably along the river Morava.Heather 2010, p. 408. A cluster of archaeological sites in the valleys of the rivers Morava, V√°h and Hron also suggests that at the latest the earliest Slavic settlements appeared in the territory around 500 AD.Heather 2010, pp. 409-410.Barford 2001, p. 54. They are characterized by vessels similar to those of the \\"Mogi≈Ça\\" group of southern Poland and having analogies in the \\"Korchak\\" pottery of Ukraine.Barford 2001, pp. 53-54. In those same years the Roman presence disappeared from the area of Danubian limes, but there is a remote possibility that Romans and those early Slavic tribes (who were the first \\"Slovaks\\") interacted commercially. Background Extent of the Roman Empire under Augustus. The yellow legend represents the extent of the Republic in 31 BC, the shades of green represent gradually conquered territories under the reign of Augustus, and pink areas on the map represent client states. The reign of Augustus (27 BC - 14 AD) began a long period known as the Pax Romana, or Roman peace. Despite continuous wars on the frontiers, and one year-long civil war over the imperial succession, the Mediterranean world remained at peace for more than two centuries. Augustus enlarged the empire dramatically, annexing Egypt, Dalmatia, Pannonia, and Raetia, expanded possessions in Africa, and completed the conquest of Hispania. By the end of his reign, the armies of Augustus had conquered the Alpine regions of Raetia and Noricum (modern Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria, Slovenia), Illyricum and Pannonia (modern Albania, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, etc.). The Romans and their armies occupied a narrow strip of the right bank of the Danube and a very small part of south- western Slovakia (Celemantia, Gerulata, Dev√≠n Castle). Augustus's successor Tiberius (14 AD - 37 AD) wanted to conquer all Germania up to the Elbe river and in 6 AD started a military expedition from the fort of Carnuntum to Mu≈°ov and beyond. However, he was forced to abandon the conquest because of a revolt in Pannonia. The expanding Roman Empire established and maintained a series of outposts around and just north of the Danube. The largest of these were Carnuntum, whose remains are on the main road halfway between Vienna and Bratislava, and Brigetio (present-day Sz≈ëny at the Slovak-Hungarian border). The Romans supported the client kingdom of the Quadi, a Germanic tribe, to maintain peace in the Middle Danube area. The Marcomanni were another Germanic tribe said by Tacitus to \\"stand first in strength and renown\\". Maroboduus, who ruled in the first quarter of the first century AD, was a powerful ruler with an extensive empire based on modern-day Bohemia that included many smaller tribes. He was fully independent of Rome. Later the Marcomanni also became clients of the Romans. The Romans built forts in the province of Pannonia, bordering on Marcomannic territory, in the earlier Flavian period (69 AD - 96 AD). These included Arrabona and Brigetio in modern Hungary. They built various military installations in the Middle Danube area at the end of the first century including the fort of Gerulata. This fort, rebuilt several times before the end of the fourth century, is still visible in the village of Rusovce in southern Bratislava. Marcomannic Wars Germanic attacks 166-171 Pannonia was invaded in late 166 or early 167 by a force of 6,000 Langobardi and Ubii. This invasion was quickly defeated by the Roman cavalry and infantry. In the aftermath the military governor of Pannonia, Iallius Bassus, initiated negotiations with 11 tribes. The Marcomannic king Ballomar, a Roman client, acted as the main negotiator for the tribes. In 168 the Marcomanni and Victohali again crossed the Danube into Pannonia, but when a Roman army advanced to Carnuntum they withdrew, promising good conduct. A much more serious invasion occurred in 169, when Ballomar formed a coalition of Germanic tribes that crossed the Danube and won a decisive victory over a force of 20,000 Roman soldiers near Carnuntum. Ballomar then led the larger part of his host southwards towards Italy, while the remainder ravaged Noricum. The Marcomanni razed Opitergium (Oderzo) and besieged Aquileia. The army of praetorian prefect Furius Victorinus tried to relieve the city, but was defeated and its general slain. The Romans reorganized, brought in fresh troops and managed to eventually evict the invaders from Roman territory by the end of 171. Roman counter-offensives 172-174 Marcus Aurelius started the invasion of what are now Slovak territories in 172 AD, when the Romans crossed the Danube into Marcomannic territory. Although few details are known, the Romans achieved success, subjugating the Marcomanni and their allies, the Varistae or Naristi and the Cotini. After the 172 campaigning season Marcus and Commodus were both given the title \\"Germanicus\\", and coins were minted with the inscription \\"Germania subacta\\" (subjugated Germany). The Marcomanni were subjected to a harsh treaty. In 173 AD the Romans campaigned against the Quadi, who had broken their treaty and assisted their kin, the Marcomanni. The Quadi were defeated and subdued. In 174 AD Marcus Aurelius penetrated deeper into the river valleys of V√°h, Nitra and Hron, where there are Roman marching camps like Laugaricio. On the banks of the Hron he wrote his philosophical work \\"Meditations\\". In the same year, the legions of Marcus Aurelius again marched against the Quadi. In response, the Quadi deposed their pro-Roman king, Furtius, and installed his rival Ariogaesus in his place. Marcus Aurelius refused to recognize Ariogaesus, and after his capture exiled him to Alexandria. By late 174, the subjugation of the Quadi was complete. Rebellion of Avidius Cassius 175-176 The Column of Marcus Aurelius in Piazza Colonna, Rome, depicting his victorious campaign against the Marcomanni, Quadi, and Sarmatians Marcus Aurelius may have intended to campaign against the remaining tribes of the area that is now western Slovakia and Bohemia, and together with his recent conquests establish two new Roman provinces, Marcomannia and Sarmatia, but whatever his plans, they were cut short by the rebellion of Avidius Cassius in the East. Marcus Aurelius marched eastwards with his army, accompanied by auxiliary detachments of Marcomanni, Quadi, and Naristi under the command of Marcus Valerius Maximianus. After the successful suppression of Cassius' revolt, the emperor returned to Rome for the first time in nearly 8 years. On 23 December 176 AD, together with his son Commodus, he celebrated a joint triumph for his German victories (\\"de Germanis\\" and \\"de Sarmatis\\"). In commemoration of this, the Aurelian Column was erected, in imitation of Trajan's Column. Second Marcomannian campaign 177-180 In 177 AD, the Quadi again rebelled, soon followed by their neighbours, the Marcomanni. After delays, Marcus Aurelius headed north on 3 August 178 to begin his second Germanic campaign, too late for serious action that year. Publius Tarrutenius Paternus was given supreme command in the campaigning season of 179. The main enemy seems to have been the Quadi and results were positive. The next year, on 17 March 180, the emperor died at Vindobona (modern Vienna), or perhaps at Bononia on the Danube, to the north of Sirmium. He probably died of plague. His death happened just before the campaigning season began, and when his dream of creating the provinces of Marcomannia and Sarmatia seemed close to fulfillment. Subsequent Roman influence When Commodus succeeded Marcus Aurelius he had little interest in pursuing the war. Against the advice of his senior generals, he negotiated a peace treaty with the Marcomanni and the Quadi, where he agreed to withdraw south of the Danube Limes. Commodus left for Rome at the end of 180 AD, where he celebrated a triumph. Romanization of the barbarian population continued in the late Roman period (181-380 AD). Many Roman-style buildings with evidence of trade with the Roman Empire were built in what is now south-western Slovakia at Bratislava, D√∫bravka, C√≠fer, P√°c and Veƒæk√Ω K√Ωr. Roman influence can be also seen in baths, coins, glass and amphorae dated to this period. The Marcomanni converted to Christianity towards the end of the fourth century when Fritigil, their queen, obtained help from Ambrose, the formidable bishop of Milan (Italy), and also persuaded her husband to place himself and his people under Roman protection. Disintegration In 373 AD, hostilities erupted between the Romans and the Quadi, who were outraged that Valentinian I was building fortifications in their territory. They complained and sent deputations that were ignored by Aequitius, the magister armorum per Illyricum. However, by that year the construction of these forts was behind schedule. Maximinus, now praetorian prefect of Gaul, arranged with Aequitius to promote his son Marcellianus and put him in charge of finishing the project. The protests of Quadian leaders continued to delay the project, and in a fit of frustration Marcellianus murdered the Quadian king Gabinius at a banquet ostensibly arranged for peaceful negotiations. This roused the Quadi to war. Valentinian did not receive news of these crises until late 374 AD. In the fall he crossed the Danube at Aquincum into Quadian and Marcomannic territory. After pillaging the lands of today's western Slovakia nearly without opposition, Valentinian retired to Savaria to winter quarters. In the spring he decided to continue campaigning and moved from Savaria to Brigetio. Once he arrived on November 17, he received a deputation from the Quadi. In return for supplying fresh recruits to the Roman army, the Quadi were to be allowed to leave in peace. However, before the envoys left they were granted an audience with Valentinian. The envoys insisted that the conflict was caused by the building of Roman forts in their lands. Furthermore, they said individual bands of Quadi were not necessarily bound to the rule of the chiefs who had made treaties with the Romans, and thus might attack the Romans at any time. This attitude of the envoys so enraged Valentinian I that he suffered a stroke that ended his life. In 434 Attila devastated the area and started the mass migrations that destroyed the Western Roman Empire. Later the area began to be occupied by Slav tribes. The first written source suggesting that Slavic tribes established themselves in what is now Slovakia is connected to the migration of the Germanic Heruli from the Middle Danube region towards Scandinavia in 512. In this year, according to Procopius, they first passed \\"through the land of the Slavs\\", most probably along the river Morava. A cluster of archaeological sites in the valleys of the rivers Morava, V√°h and Hron also suggests that at the latest the earliest Slavic settlements appeared in the territory around 500 AD. They are characterized by vessels similar to those of the \\"Mogi≈Ça\\" group of southern Poland and having analogies in the \\"Korchak\\" pottery of Ukraine. Archaeological remains Laugaricio A Roman inscription in Laugaricio, ordered by Marcus Valerius Maximianus, at the castle hill of Trenƒç√≠n (178‚Äì179 AD) The winter camp of Laugaricio (modern-day Trenƒç√≠n) lies near the northernmost line of the Roman hinterlands, the limes Romanus. This was where the Legio II Adiutrix fought and prevailed in a decisive battle over the tribe of Quadi in 179 AD. Laugaricio, not far from the modern Poland-Slovakia border, is the most northern remains of the presence of Roman soldiers in central Europe. Soldiers of the Legio II Adiutrix carved the Roman inscription on the rock below today's castle. It reads: Victoriae Augustorum exercitus, qui Laugaricione sedit, mil(ites) l(egiones) II DCCCLV. (Maximi)anus leg(atus leg)ionis II Ad(iutricis) cur(avit) f(aciendum) (To the Victory of the army of the Augusti, stationed in Laugaricio, 855 legionaries of the II (dedicated this monument), the arrangements being undertaken by Maximian, legate of Legio II Adiutrix.) Gerulata Ruins of Gerulata Gerulata was a Roman military camp from the second to fourth centuries. It is located near today's Rusovce, on the right side of the Danube to the south of Bratislava. The name was probably taken from the Celtic name for the location, which seems to have been near a ford over the river. The fortified camp was established in the Flavian period, built by the X, XIV and XV Legions, and continued to be occupied and modified throughout the Roman period. The site has been subject to many years of archaeological research. Findings include inscribed stone votive altars and sepulchral monuments richly decorated with plant and figures. Many military artifacts have been discovered, as well as decorative jewelry, clasps and buckles. Jewels include gems, armlets, bracelets, pendants, rings, amulets. Coins include a complete sequence of Roman emperors apart from a short break in the first half of the third century. The findings also include everyday tools and implements ‚Äì sickles, scissors, chisels, wrenches, clamps, fittings. The soldiers also left behind gambling chips and dice. The findings reflect the cosmopolitan nature of the Roman empire. Troops stationed here also campaigned on the lower Rhine and in Africa. Roman, Etruscan and Greek gods are represented, as well as symbols from the cults of Phrygia, Syria, Africa and elsewhere. There are also early traces of Christianity. Celemantia Ruins of Roman fort of Celemantia The fortress of Celemantia is within the modern village of I≈æa-Le√°nyv√°r on the left side of the Danube, downstream from Gerulata. Brigetio (modern Sz≈ëny) on the south bank of the Danube in Pannonia was a thriving urban center, as shown by the remains of temples, mineral spring spas and villas that contained elaborate mosaics, pottery and metalwork. Celementia was purely a military outpost, connected to Brigeto by a pontoon bridge that could be removed in wartime. Construction of the castellum of Celemantia started in 171 AD on the orders of Marcus Aurelius. The fortress was burned down in 179 by the Marcomannic and Quadian tribes, but a stone fort was later built on the same site that lasted into Late Antiquity. Celemantia was a huge fortress. It was laid out as a square with sides about long, with rounded corners. The walls were up to wide and high. The camp had 20 towers with reinforced walls and two towers guarding gates in the center of the sides of the square. The camp buildings included barracks, stables and warehouses constructed on standard designs. The main buildings were entirely built of stone, but most buildings had stone foundations with adobe walls and tile roofs. The camp also contained tanks, wells, cisterns and ovens. A major renovation was undertaken in the fourth century. At the end of the fourth century the camp was destroyed and was not rebuilt. The Germanic Quadi occupied the ruins for a while, but by the middle of the fifth century it had been abandoned. In modern times, the camp was used as a quarry to build the fortress and other buildings in nearby Kom√°rno. Exploratory archaeological work was conducted in 1906-1909, with sporadic projects from then onwards. The layout and methods of construction have gradually been uncovered. Discoveries include coins and other metal objects, an ivory statuette of a comic actor, ceramic fragments, weapons, jewelry, tools and equipment. Stone sculptures show a diversity of religious beliefs. Other locations *One of the first Roman military installations in the Middle Danube region is visible on the steep hill of Dev√≠n, where the March flows into the Danube. This may be a small fortress or fortified tower. In the ruins of the Roman castle an iron cross was found in a tomb dating to the fourth century, the earliest relic of Christianity north of the Danube. *The small Roman forts of Zavod and Suchohrad in the Morava river region indicate an attempt to penetrate toward northern Bohemia-Moravia and the Oder river, and perhaps into southern Poland. *A Roman fort from the period of the Marcomannic wars has been excavated near Bratislava in Stupava. Discoveries include documents, ceramics, jewelry, coins, fragments of glass vessels and economic tools. *The latest archaeological discoveries which have located new Roman enclosures in the surroundings of Brno led to the conclusion that the advance of Roman troops from Carnumtum could have run further to the north-east, into the region of the Slovak-Polish border. Indeed, recent archaeological excavations and aerial surveys have shown further locations in northeast Moravia: three temporary Roman camps (possibly connected to the Laugaricio fort) situated in the foreland of the so-called Moravian Gate (Olomouc-Ne≈ôed√≠n, Hul√≠n-Pravƒçice, Osek) have been partly corroborated, the former two clearly by digging.

Originally developed at the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as ST-SIZE, it was licensed for commercial use by Collier Research Corporation in 1996. Additional proprietary code was added and the software was marketed under the name HyperSizer. History HyperSizer developed from the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) ST-SIZE research code. ST-SIZE was originally developed because NASA identified a need for accurate methods of formulating panel stiffness and thermal expansion coefficients, leading to the development of ST-SIZE from 1988 to 1995. Another need was the reduction of mass on high-speed aircraft and weight reduction for optimization. ST-SIZE was developed by a team of engineers working on the National Aerospace Plane X-30. Two major versions of ST-SIZE were created. The original version included formulations for stiffness terms and thermal expansion coefficients based on approximations often taken in traditional design methods. In 1990, a version of ST-SIZE was formed for structural design and weight prediction. A new method for formulation of stiffened panel properties was developed starting in 1991. A method for including composite lamina and laminate data in the formulation of stiffened panel structural properties was first developed. Thermal coefficients were created to handle both in-plane and through-the- thickness temperature gradients for membrane, bending, and membrane-bending coupling. A method was then developed to enter these thermal expansion and bending coefficients into the MSC Software version of Nastran for finite element analysis (FEA) using a model with a single plane of finite elements. Other solvers are supported such as I-DEAS. In May 1996, Collier Research Corporation was formed in Hampton, Virginia from the original ST-SIZE design team, which included Craig S. Collier. Collier Research obtained an exclusive, all-fields-of-use license, and became the first company to license NASA software for commercial use. They combined the NASA LaRC ST-SIZE copyright research code with other company proprietary software; the combined software became HyperSizer. Uses GlobalFlyer Commercial customers use HyperSizer software to design and analyze composite material and metallic structures. For example, the wind turbine design industry uses the program to design 100-meter long blades that are light and manufacturable. Beginning with the NASA astronaut Composite Crew Module (CCM) of the Orion spacecraft, the CSeries and Learjet 85 of Bombardier Aerospace, HyperSizer has seen use on projects that are primarily or entirely composite structures. The record-setting Scaled Composites GlobalFlyer was designed with the help of Hypersizer, as well as the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer. Earlier codes were originally intended for weight prediction but evolved into ones that were able to assess structural integrity and find optimum sizes and materials. HyperSizer Version 6.1, released in May 2011, contains an integrated suite of failure analysis predictions verified by test data. New capabilities optimize manufacturing. Capabilities have been added to include: macromechanics, micromechanics, failure mode and effects analysis, panel concepts, composite optimization, and integration with Abaqus FEA software. There are two available versions of HyperSizer, Pro and Express. Both HyperSizer Pro and Express can equally analyze and design laminates and sandwich panels, and update the FEM, and report margins. HyperSizer Express (released 2016) delivers key capabilities of HyperSizer Pro in a user-friendly packaged aimed at the composite engineer. While HyperSizer Pro specializes in aerospace and space launch, applications for Express include automotive, sporting goods, medical, industrial, and marine. Details HyperSizer is written in Fortran and Visual Basic and contains over 400,000 lines of code. The software is compatible with Microsoft Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10. Version 6.1 (released in May 2011) integrated with FEA solvers in an iterative loop conducting trade studies and examining potential design candidates. HyperSizer ensures structural integrity through failure analyses. It increases manufacturability by minimizing ply drops, identifying laminate transition add/drop boundaries, and defining ply shapes. HyperSizer competes in the analysis and sizing software market with Firehole Composites, ESI, and ESAComp among others. HyperSizer Pro was rated first in the \\"tools of the month\\" by Desktop Engineering magazine in July 2011. HyperSizer Express was named \\"Editor's Pick\\" by Desktop Engineering in March 2016.

It was developed in 2009 alongside the Didgori-1 using the same internal features with some additional functions. The armoured personnel carrier is thought to provide transport, enhanced visibility and firepower support for infantry troops and SF in various missions including reconnaissance and convoy protection.http://delta.gov.ge/file/2015/04/Didgori_STC_Delta_Production- Catalogue_01.01.2015.pdfhttp://www.military- today.com/apc/didgori.htmhttp://www.army-technology.com/projects/didgori-apc/ Specifications and mobility The Didgori is assembled on and around the chassis of US Ford Super Duty F-550 heavy duty pickup trucks with V8 Power Stroke Turbo Diesel engines and power assisted hydraulic steering. The product basis choice has proven very effective during trials and in the field on various types of terrain. The max. speed on paved roads is 120‚Äì140 km/h and reduced to 80 km/h on terrain. Acceleration from 0‚Äì100 km/h is achieved in 22 seconds. The cruising range at 60 km/h is 500 km. Each unit has at least one 20 litre fuel can in reserve. The vehicle can operate at temperatures ranging from -32¬∞ to +55¬∞ and remains unaffected by heavy meteorological conditions. The wheels consist of Hutchinson 12r20 mpt80 type tyres which have a run flat capability of 50 km at 50 km/h. The Didgori has 400 mm ground clearance and is able to climb slopes at a 60% gradient and drive sideways along a slope at a 40% gradient. The vehicle base version is not amphibious - although such a variant is an option, but can move in up to 1 m deep water.http://delta.gov.ge/wp- content/uploads/2015/04/Didgori_STC_Delta_Production- Catalogue_01.01.2015.pdfhttp://delta.gov.ge/en/product/didgori/ Saudi Arabian trials On 27 August 2014, Georgia participated with a MedEvac prototype in a tender for armoured personnel carriers hosted by the Ministry of Defence of Saudi Arabia. The tests were carried out mostly in the Arabian desert but also urban areas and included movement on different altitudes - mountains, various types of terrain and gradients, weather conditions, under extreme stress and maximum weight burden at top speed. The trials culminated in a 40 km simulated fully loaded evacuation at maximum speed. The Didgori passed every test with very good results and made it to the finals alongside the American Lenco BearCat after eliminating four other competing vehicles, including the American Oshkosh M-ATV. Even though the Didgori also showed better results than its American finalist counterpart in every aspect, the winner was not announced earlier than January 2016, after months of consulting and evaluation. The Saudi Arabian tender was a very important event to test the vehicle's capabilities in extreme conditions, particularly in a desert environment. DELTA consequently made necessary adjustments and changes for both its export and home products. Electronic equipment Every base variant is equipped with thermal imaging and night vision FLIR Systems attached to the front and rear end, as well as underneath the hull on each side. Information from the cameras is displayed on three monitors: one for the driver, one for the commander and one for the passengers. A special navigation system GPS is installed on the vehicle in order to provide additional information via short message service (SMS) to the crew. The system works in any meteorological condition contrary to other GPS systems. According to the developer, the vehicle can operate at full capacity in an environment with temperatures ranging from -32 ¬∞C to +55 ¬∞C without damaging the electronics. All systems operate on 24V DC on a 200 amp alternator with a 78amp/hr battery. The vehicle has no standard issue radio mount thus can be equipped according to army requirements or customer preferences.http://delta.gov.ge/wp- content/uploads/2015/04/Didgori_STC_Delta_Production-Catalogue_01.01.2015.pdf  Armament  The standard main armament consists of a M134 minigun mount, open turret drive shafts rotational unit - external or air flow. The firing rate can be adjusted from 300 to 6,000 rounds per minute. Total mount weight is 22.7 kg without the ammunition feed system. Primary ordnance is the 7.62√ó51mm NATO. Ammunition capacity can range from 1,500 (total weight 58 kg) to 4,500 (total weight 134 kg) rounds. Optionally the standard armament can be a 12.7√ó108 mm DShK or NSV machine gun. The latest variants have DRWS-1 remote weapon stations equipped with twinned 12.7 mm machineguns and one 7.62 mm lmg attached.http://delta.gov.ge/file/2015/01/drws-1.pdf Alternatively grenade launchers, ATGMs and short range low-altitude air defence weapons can be fitted on the vehicle.  Protection  Depending on build and in combination with the vehicle's angled design, which is described as monocoque, Didgoris can offer either STANAG 4569 level II or level III protection against small arms fire, including 7.62x39 mm and 7.62x54 mm AP / steel core rounds. The engine and crew compartment areas are encased in double armour layers and withstand mines and other explosives in accordance with STANAG 4569 Level 2A. The crew seats are specially designed to disperse blasts. Didgoris are equipped with run-flat tires, enabling them to drive on with damaged tires a distance of 50 km at 50 km/h maximum speed. Additionally, a central tire inflation system can be installed to further increase their survivability. All four wheel flanges are ballistic.

Life and times Riccheri was born in San Lorenzo, Santa Fe to Catalina Ciufardi and Lazzaro Riccheri, both Italian immigrants from the Region of Liguria. He enrolled at the National War College on a scholarship, and graduated with honors in 1879 as a second lieutenant. He subsequently completed higher studies at the Royal Military Academy of Belgium, in Brussels. where he presented a thesis on the defense of Belgium and earned an officer's degree in 1883. Riccheri was promoted to captain and returned to Argentina in 1886. The following year, he was transferred to the Argentine Embassy in Berlin as a military attach√©. He was named director of the European bureau of the Argentine Armaments Commission in 1890 and of the Technical Commission on Armaments in 1895, in which capacity he purchased a large shipment of new Mauser rifles and cannons for 18 artillery batteries, and had a rail line to Neuqu√©n built for the Argentine Army. He was named colonel, and in 1898 returned to Argentina as Director General of the National War Arsenal. Riccheri married Dolores Murature in 1901; she was the granddaughter of Commodore Jos√© F√©lix Murature, a hero of the Cisplatine War of the 1820s. Their family life was marked by tragedy, however. Their first daughter died within hours of birth and a second daughter at age 11, as a result of which Mrs. Riccheri developed clinical depression. President Julio Roca subsequently appointed Riccheri Army Chief of Staff, and on July 13, 1900, citing his \\"intelligent furor and single-minded dedication to our military procurement needs,\\" President Roca named him the nation's War Minister. His tenure was marked by ongoing efforts to modernize the Argentine Armed Forces amid tensions in Argentina-Chile relations resulting from the Beagle and Puna de Atacama disputes. Riccheri reorganized the War Department; restored the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers (protagonists during the Argentine War of Independence and the Cisplatine War, though inactive since 1826); streamlined the National War College and other instructional institutions, enacting standardized testing; commissioned the establishment of Army bases of Campo de Mayo (Greater Buenos Aires), General Paz (C√≥rdoba), Campo de los Andes (Mendoza), Paracao (Paran√°), and General Belgrano (Salta); and divided the Army into twenty (later, seven) geographic regions. He also advanced the landmark Law 4.301 (the Ricchieri Act) of 1901, which mandated compulsory military service for a minimum of one year for able-bodied Argentine men at age 18; conscription (colloquially known in Argentina as la colimba) would remain in force until 1995. Riccheri supported proposed military action against neighboring Chile over ongoing border disputes. War, however, was averted by the May Pacts and the Treaty of Arbitration, both signed in 1902. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in 1904 and retired from his post as War Minister upon the end of President Roca's term in October. He served briefly as Director of the National War College between October 1904 and January 1905. He again served as Army Chief of Staff and was promoted to the rank of major general in 1910. Riccheri believed the military should remain a disinterested party in Argentine politics. He nevertheless lent his support in 1909 to UCR leader Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen's call for universal male suffrage and the secret ballot (reforms opposed by the ruling National Autonomist Party). These reforms were ultimately enacted with the S√°enz Pe√±a Law of 1912. A monument to General Riccheri by Luis Perlotti guards his Recoleta Cemetery crypt Riccheri and explorer Francisco Moreno co-founded the Argentine Boy Scouts Association on July 4, 1912; he served as its first secretary, during Moreno's tenure as President of Scouts de Argentina, and succeeded Moreno as its president upon the latter's death in 1919. Ricchieri was commissioned in 1916 to prepare a situational appraisal of World War I for the Argentine Government, which at that point considered enlisting troops to the aid of the Triple Entente allies. He retired in 1922 as a lieutenant general. Twelve years later, in recognition of his distinguished military service, he was promoted to Army General by President Agust√≠n Justo. Riccheri was also honored abroad, receiving the Order of the Red Eagle (Germany), merit badges from Chile and France, and an appointment as Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown. He died in Buenos Aires in 1936 and was buried with the highest military honors in La Recoleta Cemetery. National Route A002, which links Buenos Aires to the Ministro Pistarini International Airport, was named in his honor in 1952.

Plot On the streets of Paris, a man mysteriously collects a group of people, finally leading them into a small apartment to witness a theatre performance. The audience, in close proximity to the actors, become voyeurs. As they walk from room to room, they watch as bumbling Silvano (Bo) attempts to hide his two girlfriends, Charlotte (Chaplin) and Emily (Birkin), from each other in this same crowded apartment. While the actors feel frustrated at the shambles of a set they must work with, the play's author, Cl√©ment Roquemaure (Kalfon), is silently auditioning them for his new play, to be held at his strangely empty mansion. After arriving at the unusual mansion, which has many wildly painted rooms, Charlotte and Emily start to experience disturbing visions, in part due to the presence of a magician, Paul, who also lives at the mansion. As the rehearsal progresses, the two actresses' visions start to unearth a romantic calamity that took place at the mansion. The final performance of the play places the two actresses into a possible tragic re-enactment of the very horror they are only now beginning to understand.Rivette: Love on the Ground / The Gang of Four Reverseshot.

Early life Paterson was born 21 March 1919 and educated at St. Lawrence College, Ramsgate. After leaving school, worked with the insurance brokers Willis Faber and Dumas on the floor of Lloyd's in Fenchurch Street. In 1936 he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and learned to fly in a de Havilland Tiger Moth at the training school at White Waltham Airfield before being posted to No. 46 Fighter Squadron RAF at RAF Digby. In 1938 Paterson transferred to the Royal Navy. Fleet Air Arm In November 1939 Paterson, known as \\"Blinkers\\" in the Fleet Air Arm, helped to form No. 804 Royal Naval Air Squadron, flying Gloster Sea Gladiators from RNAS Hatston, on Orkney. 804 Sqn fought during the Norway campaign and returned to Britain in the carrier HMS Glorious not long before she was sunk by the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. In autumn 1940 Sub Lt. Paterson was one of more than 50 Fleet Air Arm pilots loaned to the RAF for the Battle of Britain, and posted to the north. In 1941, after converting to Hawker Hurricat, he was sent to join the fighter catapult ship HMS Springbank. The Hurricat was a specially modified Hurricane launched from a catapult and intended to defend convoys from air threat; to save weight it was stripped of its undercarriage and, after chasing off enemy bombers, the pilot had to ditch in the sea, where he was hopefully picked up by ship. On 27 September 1941 Springbank was torpedoed by the German submarine U-201 while escorting convoy HG 73 in the Atlantic. Many lives were lost and Paterson swam to the corvette . He then flew Sea Hurricanes from , one of three carriers which accompanied the convoy to Malta in Operation Pedestal in August 1942. Paterson and his comrades flew three and four sorties a day, and losses to pilot fatigue, friendly fire and enemy action reduced No. 885 RNAS to three serviceable aircraft on the second day. That afternoon, while chasing three bombers of an incoming raid, Paterson was jumped by enemy fighters which he evaded by diving to 500 ft into the protection of a destroyer's anti-aircraft fire. Paterson was mentioned in dispatches. On 27 March 1943 off the Clyde, Paterson was serving in the escort carrier when she was lost: she had finished flying for the day and aircraft were being refuelled when spilt aviation fuel exploded. Paterson, who was in the bow of the ship, the only area unaffected by the inferno, jumped into the freezing sea where the leaking fuel also caught fire. He managed to swim to a rescuing destroyer. After the war Paterson converted to helicopters. He also played an important part in rescue operations after the Greek earthquake disaster of 1953. Paterson had not waited for official approval and he loaded two Dragonfly helicopters on to the cruiser at Malta. For three weeks Paterson ran relief work around Zakinthos, flying food and medical supplies, evacuating the injured and organising a non-stop airlift between ship and shore. Paterson was awarded the MBE. He became commanding officer of No. 848 RNAS during the Malayan Emergency in 1956. Flying the Sikorsky S-55, the Squadron helped to pioneer the technique and tactics of troop lift, thereby giving much needed flexibility to land operations. By December that year, 848 had lifted 41,000 troops and more than 750,000 lb of freight. Paterson was awarded the DFC. Considered an able and conscientious staff officer who would have done well in the higher ranks, he retired from the Navy in 1959 after flying more than 2,000 hours in 20 types of aircraft. Later life He tried a career in film- making and was technical adviser on the set of Operation Amsterdam, starring Peter Finch; he became landlord of the Horse and Groom at Polegate, Sussex, and in 1970 successfully took over a company making metal and plastic labels.

Because the railroad needed significant amounts of gravel for track ballast purposes, a small spur line was built from the main line to the base of the hill, enabling workers to shovel gravel into rail cars that were then taken to the construction zone.Converse, Robert N. The Archaeology of Ohio. Columbus: Archaeological Society of Ohio, 2003. Prior to their excavations, it appeared to be a simple hill, about in area and covered with an apple orchard; before the apple trees were planted, it had been the site of an unusually dense and lush woodland.Cunningham, Wilbur M. A Study of the Glacial Kame Culture in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana. Occasional Contributions from the Museum of Anthropology of the University of Michigan 12. Ann Arbor: U of Michigan P, 1948, 12. Findings As digging at the Richardson Kame continued, workers began to find significant numbers of skeletons; by the time that the quarrying process was complete, hundreds of buried bodies had been discovered. The exact number of burials is uncertain; one source records 380 bodies,Late Archaic Burials, Ohio Historical Society, n.d. Accessed 2010-12-08. while lead excavator John Matson recorded 308, and he estimated that the remains of as many as four or five hundred individuals had been interred at the site. These bodies were buried in a range of positions and conditions; some bodies were face-down and others were flexed in other ways, and evidence of cremation was also present.Baerreis, David A., et al. \\"The Burial Complex of the Reigh Site, Winnebago County, Wisconsin.\\" Wisconsin Archaeologist 35 (1954): 34. More than fifty of the skeletons were shown to have been the bodies of children under the age of eight years, including one unborn child inside the ribs of its mother. Conversely, at least seven bodies showed pronounced ossification in the cartilage of their tracheas; Matson believed this to be a sign of extreme age, and recent research shows that this process is often correlated with advancing age.Kusafuka, Kimihide, et al. \\"Ossification of Tracheal Cartilage in Aged Humans: A Histological and Immunohistochemical Analysis.\\" Journal of Bone and Mineral Metabolism 19.3 (2001): 168-174. Not all of the bones were present as complete skeletons; some bodies had plainly been beheaded, and one of the burial pits yielded a pile of twenty-seven skulls. Moreover, the bodies did not appear to have been buried soon after death; the positions in which the bones were found convinced Matson that they had been buried after the flesh was no longer present. Besides human bodies, findings in the kame included the bodies of dogs next to human skeletons, plus beads of copper and shells, other copper tools, various stone tools, and sandal-sole-shaped shell gorgets. The most important of these artifacts included a bird stone, awls made from the bones of deer, a string of shell beads long that had been wrapped multiple times around a group of bodies, and groups of rattlesnake rattles that were not included in Matson's report. Results Throughout the excavation, Matson was careful to record the findings at the site, and he published his conclusions after the excavation was concluded. Because little was known in the mid-19th century about Ohio's prehistoric inhabitants, he was unable to identify the cultural affinity of the people buried at the Ridgeway Site: they were plainly not part of any people that had previously been recorded. As a result, his conclusions were limited to the observation that the Ridgeway people were able to trade with peoples who lived around sources of shells and copper. In the 1880s, the site was seen as an extreme example of a site of the Mound Builders,Perrin, William Henry, ed. History of Summit County, with an Outline Sketch of Ohio. Chicago: Baskin and Battey, 1881, 208. but since that time, the Ridgeway Site has been identified as the type site of the Glacial Kame Culture, which was prominent throughout the Great Lakes region during the later portion of the Archaic period. Today, Hardin County and the adjacent Logan County are regarded as the heartland of the Glacial Kame people, and the Ridgeway and Zimmerman sites in southern Hardin County are among the most significant sites ever found of that people. Many known Glacial Kame sites are of relatively little archaeological value, as they are frequently discovered only after modern excavation machinery has destroyed many of the ancient artifacts; as a result, well-recorded sites like Ridgeway and Zimmerman are of immense value.Drennen, Bert C., III.

While the film's score was composed by Howard Shore, a close friend of the Director David Cronenberg, the album was remixed for individual release by the record label Var√®se Sarabande. The new mix was done by Scot Holton who chose to emphasize many of the elements of the score differently from in the original film. The soundtrack was released on vinyl in 1982 by Var√®se Sarabande,Discogs: Howard Shore - Videodrome Soundtrack and subsequently re-released on CD in 1998. It is currently out of print. Recording Videodrome was the third film of Cronenberg's to be scored by Howard Shore. For the recording, Shore used dramatic orchestral music that increasingly incorporated, and eventually emphasized, electronic instrumentation. This was designed to follow the protagonist Max Renn's descent into video hallucinations. In order to achieve this, Shore composed the entire score for an orchestra before programming it into a Synclavier II digital synthesizer. The rendered score, taken from the Synclavier II, was then recorded being played in tandem with a small string section. The resulting sound was a subtle blend that often made it difficult to tell which sounds were real and which were synthesized. Differences from the film The album is not a direct copy of the music used in the film, but rather a remixing. The mix was an assembly of the film's original tracks that often accentuated the various layers of the music differently from in the film itself. It also includes elements of synthesized speech and sound effects. The mix was done by Scot Holton of Var√®se Sarabande, who loved many of the subtler elements of the film's score and made them more prominent in the album's tracks. Shore has commented that while there were small issues with some of the acoustic numbers, that \\"on the whole I think they did very well.\\" Reception While largely unnoticed by critics, the reception to the Videodrome soundtrack has been largely favourable. Praise was given to the synthesized elements for creating a dark and ominous tone while capturing the hallucinatory reality of the film. One critic went so far as to call it \\"music that harnesses the transformative power of technology to warn against its growing influences over everyone.\\" These electronic elements have been criticized as well, with one critic noting that it could be viewed as \\"a lackluster venture into cost cutting,\\"Amazon.com: Videodrome Soundtrack - Editorial Review but notes that \\"the results are thematically precise and satisfying.\\" After the initial release in 1982, the album's popularity was strong enough to cause Var√®se Sarabande to recommend its release onto CD. It was released on CD in 1998 and was out of print until a re-press in 2010.

He was convicted in federal court on May 24, 2012, of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, attempted murder of federal employees, and weapons charges. He was sentenced on August 10, 2012, to two consecutive sentences of life in prison, plus 60 years. After Abdo applied for conscientious objector status in the spring of 2010 pending his deployment to Afghanistan, the Army approved his discharge. While processing him, officials found child pornography on his government-issued computer and in June 2010, the Army recommended that he be court-martialed. Abdo denied the charges, and went AWOL from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, over the July 4 weekend. Abdo is alleged to have planned the bombing because of his opposition as a Muslim to the U.S. War in Afghanistan. However, the US Attorney in the case, Robert Pitman, compared the plot to the 2012 mass murders by two other American men: the shootings at a movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado, and at a Sikh temple in suburban Milwaukee. He said that Abdo had planned to use violence \\"to advance [his] twisted agenda.\\"SARAH KUTA, \\"Naser Jason Abdo Sentenced To Life For Fort Hood Plot\\", Huffington Post, August 10, 2012, retrieved January 15, 2013 Early life Abdo was born to Carlisa Morlan\\"Naser Jason Jamal Abdo\\", Texas Birth Index, 1903‚Äì1997, Ancestry.com, Texas Birth Index, 1903‚Äì1997 [database on-line].

When Naser was 3, his parents divorced, and he lived most of his childhood with his father. In Garland, the boy attended Richardson Terrace Elementary School, South Garland High School and Berkner High School. According to Abdo's 2010 statement to the Army, at the age of 17, he began practicing Islam. The following year, he took classes in mass communication at the American University in Dubai. His father lived for about 25 years in the United States. After being convicted in 2006 of soliciting a minor over the Internet, the senior Abdo served three years of a five-year sentence in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. The US government deported him back to Jordan in 2010. Army With no job prospects, soon before his 19th birthday, Abdo joined the United States Army in March 2009. At the time of the Fort Hood shootings later that year, he condemned the actions of Nidal Malik Hasan, who was arrested and charged in the case. Abdo's brigade from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, was deployed to Afghanistan in February 2010. Abdo stayed behind to continue authorized studies in language school to learn Pashto, one of the predominant languages in the area where US troops are deployed in the country. He was due to deploy to Afghanistan in June 2010, but applied that spring for conscientious objector status. He said the prospect of deployment had forced him to examine his beliefs, and as a Muslim he could not serve in Afghanistan against Muslim peoples. In an interview with Al-Jazeera TV, which aired on August 21, 2010 (as translated by MEMRI), Abdo said, \\"I don't believe I can involve myself in an army that wages war against Muslims. I don't believe I could sleep at night if I take part, in any way, in the killing of a Muslim.\\"Muslim US Serviceman Nasser Abdo Talks to Al-Jazeera TV about His Refusal to Deploy to Afghanistan, MEMRITV.org, transcript, (video clip available here, Clip No. 2594, August 21, 2010. The Army approved his discharge, but it was put on hold when Army officials discovered child pornography on his government-issued computer while processing him out. At a June 15 hearing, Army officials recommended that Abdo be court-martialed. After being charged with possessing child pornography, which he denied, Abdo went AWOL from Fort Campbell during the July 4 weekend in 2011. In the spring, two anti-war groups, Iraq Veterans Against the War and Courage to Resist, had initially supported Abdo's conscientious objector bid. In a statement for Iraq Veterans Against the War, Abdo had written, \\"Only when the military and America can disassociate Muslims from terror can we move onto a brighter future of religious collaboration and dialogue that defines America and makes me proud to be an American.\\" After Abdo's arrest, a spokesman for Iraq Veterans condemned the planned attack, saying it was utterly against their principles. Upon learning of Abdo's arrest on the pornography charges in June 2010, Courage to Resist, which had contributed to Abdo's legal fees in the conscientious objector case, said in a statement that it had removed the private's profile from its website and no longer supported him. Arrest On July 27, 2011, the staff of the Guns Galore gunstore in Killeen, Texas, near Fort Hood noted that Abdo bought an unusually large amount of smokeless gunpowder, three boxes of shotgun ammunition, and a magazine for a pistol. A clerk notified the Killeen Police Department, who tracked Abdo to the Best Value Inn and Suites. Coincidentally, Guns Galore was the store in which Nidal Malik Hasan bought the FN Five-seven pistol used in the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, as well as the store where the killer in the 2014 Fort Hood shooting allegedly bought his pistol. At Abdo's hotel room, Killeen police found a handgun and the ingredients for an explosive device, including gunpowder, shrapnel, and pressure cookers. Also in the room was an article entitled, \\"Make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom,\\" from Inspire magazine, the English- language publication of Al Qaeda. According to Daniel Pipes of The Washington Times, the \\"materials in Pfc. Abdo‚Äôs possession corresponded precisely to the \\"ingredients\\" listed in the Inspire magazine article on bomb-making.\\" Abdo had bought a uniform with Fort Hood patches from a military surplus store to fit in with local soldiers. Court hearing In a court hearing on July 29, 2011, Abdo was charged with possession of an unregistered destructive device. He did not enter a plea at that time. He was ordered held without bond. While leaving the courtroom, Abdo shouted: \\"Nidal Hasan ‚Äî Ft. Hood 2009\\" in reference to the Army major Hasan charged with the Fort Hood shooting. Abdo also invoked the name of Abeer Qassim al-Janabi, a 14-year-old girl raped and murdered by United States Army soldiers in Iraq. (Five current or former soldiers were charged and convicted in the case.) According to court papers, Abdo \\"admitted that he planned to assemble two bombs in the hotel room using gun powder and shrapnel packed into pressure cookers\\" to explode at a restaurant popular with soldiers. After hearing testimony from the FBI in February 2012, the federal judge stated that Abdo could be indicted on additional charges. He represented himself in court and again denied that he had possessed child pornography. On May 24, 2012, Abdo was found guilty in federal court of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, attempted murder of federal employees, possession of a weapon in furtherance of a federal crime of violence, and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a federal crime of violence. On August 10, 2012, he was sentenced to a term of life plus 60 years in prison. Abdo is currently being held at ADX Florence. Abdo is the third American Muslim soldier since the United States (US) started warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq to be charged with actions related to attacks on fellow US soldiers. He was charged for a bomb plot, not terrorism, as he acted alone and was not part of a terrorist organization. In 2003 at the start of the Iraq War, Sgt. Hasan Karim Akbar killed two officers and wounded 14 soldiers of the 101st Airborne in a fragging: a grenade and shooting attack at their base in Kuwait. Such incidents were rare in the Iraq War but frequent by aggrieved troops during the Vietnam War. The November 2009 shooting incident at Fort Hood, by the US Army psychiatrist, Nidal Malik Hasan, has been characterized by the Department of Defense as \\"workplace violence\\" pending the major's court-martial. The U.S. Attorney in the Abdo case, Robert Pitman, compared the AWOL soldier's plot to mass murders in 2012 by two other American men: shootings \\"at a movie theatre near Denver and a Sikh temple in suburban Milwaukee. 'In the wake of the tragic events in Colorado and Wisconsin, this is yet another reminder that there are those among us who would use or plan to use violence to advance their twisted agenda,' Pitman said.\\" References External links *Spaetzel, Nicole. \\"Case 45: Abdo.\\" In: Mueller, John (editor, from Ohio State University).

It was built from 1870 to 1990s. It is also known as Dutton Park Cemetery. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 October 2003. The cemetery was established in 1866 and remained in active use until the 1960s, after which its use has been limited by lack of space for new graves. History In 1851, the residents of South Brisbane discovered (apparently to their surprise) that the government of New South Wales (before the separation of Queensland) had set aside around 5 acres of land for a general cemetery for South Brisbane. (In 2011 that land is the site of the West End State School.) However, no trustees were ever appointed and no burials occurred. In 1865, the Queensland Government decided to sell that site and use the proceeds towards another burial ground. In 1866 a grant of 18 acres of land was made for the South Brisbane Cemetery by the Queensland Government. The original trustees were Thomas Blacket Stephens, Albert John Hockings, William Theophilus Blakeney, William Henry Baynes and James Mooney. The first person buried in the cemetery was Jane Hockings in July 1870. Although Christian burials in Europe were traditionally clustered around churches, following the rise of urban populations in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, churchyards became inadequate for the numbers of burials required. After the example set by France, towns in Britain, and in Australia, set aside land on the outskirts of settlement as public cemeteries. This was thought to be healthier and provided a spacious, landscaped environment where monuments and plantings could be attractively set out. Brisbane's first public cemetery of this type was established at Milton in the 1840s though it has since been built over. Nundah cemetery was established in 1846 and Moggill in 1855. The area now that is now known as Dutton Park was originally called Bloggo or Boggo. It was thickly timbered and cut by steep gullies. A rough track from Woolloongabba to Ipswich passed through it. Some farms were established in the 1840s, the road was surveyed and a bridge across the river was built in the 1860s, but there were few houses. In 1863 the area around Dutton Park was surveyed. A large recreation reserve was set aside, and then divided into recreation and cemeteries reserves by a later survey. The Cemetery Act of 1865 provided for the government to set up general cemeteries under the control of local trustees and South Brisbane Cemetery was established in 1866 under Trustees TB Stephens, AJ Hocking, WT Blakeney, WM Baynes and J Mooney. The first burial took place in July 1870 and was that of Jane Hocking. The South Brisbane Cemetery was one of several government reserves in the area. A public park runs along its northern boundary and there were reserves for a pound, a gaol, an asylum and an orphanage in the vicinity. As public transport became available more people moved to the area. A railway station was opened at Boggo Junction in 1884 and the first horse drawn bus service linking the area with the city began in 1890. The main road and the railway pass close to the cemetery, which was important in providing access for funeral corteges and for those visiting graves before private transport was common. A Caretakers Cottage was built in 1881 and in 1888 handsome entrance gates, railings and a boundary wall were designed by the noted architect AB Wilson and were built by W Reid at a cost of ¬£662. In 1891 R Wilcock carried out extensions to the wall to Wilson's design. In 1904 permission was given to add an area of 7 acres on the south side of Cornwall Street to the cemetery reserve. This was an area that had been surveyed for residential subdivision and adding it to the reserve effectively closed a section of Cornwall Street. In 1891 the wall was extended by R. Wilcock. The cemetery was enlarged in 1904 by the addition of 7 acres on the south side of Cornwall Street. In 1908 a tramline reached the area with a terminus close to the cemetery at the corner of Gladstone and Cornwall Roads. The area developed rapidly in the 1900s and in 1914 it was renamed Dutton Park in honour of C B Dutton, Secretary of Public Lands between 1883 and 1887. By the late 1920s, the suburb was considered fashionable. The Greater Brisbane Council was created in 1925 by amalgamating the metropolitan councils. The Brisbane City Council assumed the management of public cemeteries in the metropolitan area from this time and took control of the South Brisbane Cemetery in 1928. In 1930 the portion of Cornwall Street between the two sections of the cemetery was officially closed. In 1930 that section of Cornwall Street (now within the cemetery) was closed as a public road. The Brisbane City Council took over the management of the cemetery in 1928. In 1939 the Brisbane City Council embarked on an extensive programme of works at the cemetery. Over the next few years, concrete paths were laid, internal roads upgraded and kerbing installed. of stone wall was constructed within the cemetery and a new chain wire fence erected from the existing iron railings in Cornwall Street to the cemetery corner. Two modern brick toilet blocks were constructed in 1941 at a cost of ¬£500. Frank Costello, City Architect between 1941 and 1952, probably designed these. Alterations and repairs were also carried out to the Sexton's cottage and waiting shed. The landscaping at the cemetery was improved with the planting of many trees and shrubs, including cypress pines and blue gums along the Brisbane River. Work on the cemetery was halted by wartime shortages of labour and materials, but recommenced in 1945 when a survey of the cemetery noted lavatory blocks for men and women, two shelter sheds, a timber sexton's cottage, a timber tool room, motor shed and men's room. A brick staff amenities block was constructed in 1954. The memorials in the cemetery range from those of prominent early residents, displaying fine examples of the mason's skill, to those of prisoners from nearby Brisbane Gaol, including that of bushranger Patrick Kenniff, who was hanged in 1902. The memorials in the cemetery reflect post World War II immigration and the cultural mix of the South Brisbane area in the second half of the 20th century. These include Greek and Italian graves and those of the many Russians who first settled around Woolloongabba and South Brisbane in the 1920s, following the Communist takeover in Russia. The cemetery also contains the graves of 50 soldiers who died in World War II. Regular visiting of graves to tend them has become less common in our society, as has burial itself. In the 19th century cremation was rare, but through the 20th century it has become steadily more common. Cemeteries established since 1950 have been of the lawn cemetery type with plaques laid flush with the ground, precluding the wide variety of memorials in earlier cemeteries such as that at South Brisbane. The cemetery was closed to new burials in 1961‚Äì1962, but continuing use of family plots is permitted and a small number of new plots were released in 1998‚Äì1999. In 1996 the Sexton's cottage burned down and the shelter sheds have not survived. War Graves There are 52 Commonwealth service personnel buried in this cemetery whose graves are registered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, 13 from World War I and 39 from World War II. CWGC Cemetery Report. Breakdown obtained from casualty records.  Current Use  By the early 1960s, the cemetery was effectively full and the cemetery was closed. However, as with most closed cemeteries, additional burials and interment of ashes in existing family graves continued to occur. Some additional plots were released in the cemetery in the 1990s.  Description  The South Brisbane Cemetery occupies a large area of undulating land sloping from the ridge at Annerley Road, Dutton Park to T J Doyle Memorial Drive on the edge of the Brisbane River. It has gullies in the central section and the layout of graves and plantings is dictated to a large extent by this undulating quality of the land. The cemetery, as a special memorial area, is bounded by walls and fences. The main entrance is on Annerley Road and has formal gates flanked by Iron railings in the form of spears set into a low sandstone wall. The entrance is formed by a pair of wrought iron gates set between decorative sandstone pillars across the carriage way and a pedestrian gate. The gates match the railings and are composed of iron spears overlaid with a sinuous vine-like decoration. The entrance at Princess Street is not marked by special plantings. Dividing left and right from the main drive are two curving drives. Although there is a formalised area of planting near the main entrance, the plantings are generally informal in layout, conforming to the terrain, and contain a great diversity of species, both indigenous and exotic. The burials are less informally arranged and are set closely in rows, as the land allows, with an east-west orientation. There are concrete paths between them and memorials of a wide variety of type, quality and age mark them. A number of the oldest memorials are large and elaborate displaying Victorian symbolism connected with death, such as broken columns, angels and vine leaves. Jane Hocking's burial, the oldest in the cemetery, is marked by the carved figure of an angel clinging to a cross atop a tapered column. Service buildings constructed in the 1940s building programme survive. They comprise small brick toilet blocks, a brick building incorporating the walls and floor slab of a 1958 building, which was used as an office, store and garage, and a staff amenities block. The cemetery contains a Trig marker, which was part of a triangulation survey of the South East region carried out by the government in 1883. This is located on the cemetery hill and is a sandstone block inscribed on top, which is now covered by a concrete path.

The unit was assembled from the portions of Dawson's 19th Arkansas Infantry Regiment and the 24th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, that were not present when the garrison of Arkansas Post surrendered. The unit is most often referred to as Hardy's Arkansas Infantry Regiment, but by the late stages of the war, the unit was simply referred to simply as Hardy's 19th Arkansas Infantry Regiment.United States.

The portions of the 19th Arkansas and the 24th Arkansas which did surrender with the garrison of Arkansas Post were ultimately released east of the Mississippi River and were also briefly designated as the 19th and 24th Consolidated Arkansas Infantry Regiment, in Govan's Brigade of the Army of Tennessee, but that consolidation ended after the Battle of Chickamauga. The 19th and 24th Consolidated Arkansas Infantry Regiment served in the Department of the Trans- Mississippi from its formation in February 1863 until the close of the war.  Organization  Hardy's Regiment was organized around February 1863 by consolidating the portions of the 19th (Dawson's) and 24th Arkansas and Crawford's Arkansas Infantry Battalion that were not captured at the Battle of Arkansas Post on January 11, 1863. Detachments from these organizations were on duty at other locations the time Union force began the attack on Fort Hindman at Arkansas Post. It would seem at the time of the attack on Arkansas Post the 24th Arkansas Infantry Regiment and Crawford's Arkansas Infantry Battalion were stationed at St. Charles preparing to place two 8inch 32 pounder smooth bore columbiad guns from the CSS Ponchartrain in battery there. When the news of the battle at Arkansas Post reached them, Colonel Portlock and approximately 147 men from the two units made a forced march from St. Charles to Arkansas Post but arrived just in time to be surrendered with the garrison. Those left at St. Charles, about 200 men from the 24th and Crawford's Battalion loaded the two 8inch columbiads onto the steamboat Bluewing, moved them up the White River to DeVal's Bluff and loaded them onto railroad flatcars to be shipped back to Little Rock. However, the Federal Gunboats arrived before the train could leave and the guns were captured. The men had made their escape into the woods except for those who were in the hospital at DeVal's Bluff, who were paroled. This detachment of approximately 200 men from the 24th Arkansas and Crawford's Battalion returned to Camp White Sulphur Springs, near Pine Bluff, where they and other members of the 24th, Dawson's 19th (including Colonel Dawson himself) and Crawford's battalion, who happened to be in the hospitals at Sulphur Springs, St Charles and Deval's Bluff at the time of the Battle of Arkansas Post, were organized into a \\"holding regiment\\" under Colonel Charles Dawson's command. The original thought was that the men would remain in this holding regiment until the captured portions of these commands were exchanged and returned to Arkansas to reform these regiments. General U. S. Grant however didn't want those men captured at Arkansas Post to be exchanged back in the Mississippi River theater of operations to oppose his operations against Vicksburg, Hence they were exchanged at City Point, Virginia instead of the normal exchange point for Trans-Mississippi prisoners at Vicksburg. This left portions of the regiments in Arkansas, and portions in Virginia.Taylor, Doyle, \\"Re: Merrill Pence regt. history of Dawson's 19th.\\" Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 28 February 2007, Accessed 7 July 2012, http://history- sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=15007 Those elements of the 19th, 24th and Crawford's Arkansas Infantry Battalion which not present to surrender with the garrison of Arkansas Post, were eventually consolidated in a regiment under command of Colonel Charles L.

It was adopted on 5 January 1976 during Khmer Rouge rule under Cambodia. This flag is similar to the flag of Vietnam. It was unique among the communist state national flags without any symbolic red star or hammer and sickle. History The flag of Democratic Kampuchea replaced the flag of the Khmer Republic, becoming the official flag of Cambodia on 5 January 1976 after the Khmer Rouge came to power in the country on 17 April 1975. During that period, it used the former Kingdom of Cambodia flag that was also flown in the United Nations headquarters from April 1975 to January 1976. It was abolished many times from provinces of Cambodia bordering Vietnam, but the country's new government counted the day of liberation of the capital city, 7 January 1979, as the official day in which it was abolished. Although the flag of the People's Republic of Kampuchea became the official flag within Cambodia after the ousting of the Khmer Rouge government, the flag of Democratic Kampuchea would still be used by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and in the United Nations. Most states kept diplomatic ties with the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea as the People's Republic of Kampuchea failed to gain widespread international recognition.Michael Vickery, Cambodia 1975-1982, Silkworm Books 2000,  Symbolism  Red represents revolution and blood and the Angkor Wat stands for state of the people, workers and peasants.

Directors *Dr. Daniel Worthington, 2018-present *Dr. Samuel Wheeler (acting), 2016‚Äì2018 *Daniel W. Stowell, 2000‚Äì2016 *Dr. Cullom Davis, 1988‚Äì2000 (Lincoln Legal Papers) Abraham Lincoln's papers Abraham Lincoln is one of America's most famous politicians and is consistently ranked as one of the greatest presidents ever to occupy the White House. Any scholarly study of his life is reliant on his written words to understand his thoughts, motives, and actions. After his father's death, Robert Todd Lincoln gathered a large collection of papers and entrusted their organization to David Davis, who was assisted by Lincoln's private secretaries John G. Nicolay and John Hay. Nicolay and Hay subsequently drew upon these nearly 20,000 documents to write their ten-volume Lincoln biography published in 1890. Robert Lincoln deposited this collection of papers at the Library of Congress in 1919 and formally deeded them to the library in January 1923, with the stipulation that they remain sealed until 21 years after his own death. The records were finally opened to the public in 1947. While the Robert Todd Lincoln Collection of Abraham Lincoln Papers at the Library of Congress is the largest single repository collection of Lincoln documents, thousands of other items are located in public and private repositories around the world. Previous attempts to locate and publish Lincoln documents include Nicolay and Hay's 1905 Complete Works of Abraham Lincoln, consisting of 12 volumes; Gilbert A. Tracy and Francis H. Allen‚Äôs 1917 Uncollected Letters of Abraham Lincoln; Rufus Rockwell Wilson‚Äôs 1947 Uncollected Works of Abraham Lincoln: His Letters, Addresses and Other Papers; and Paul Angle's 1930 New Letters and Papers of Lincoln. In the 1930s, the Abraham Lincoln Association began collecting photostats of Lincoln documents and by 1945 began drafting plans that eventually culminated in The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, edited by Roy P. Basler, Marion Dolores Pratt, and Lloyd A. Dunlap. It was published in 8 volumes (plus an index) between 1953 and 1955, with two supplemental volumes published in 1974 and 1990. Basler‚Äôs Collected Works has become a standard resource for Lincoln and Civil War scholarship, but it suffers from limitations and omissions. Collected Works did not include incoming correspondence to Lincoln, which denies the reader important context. New technology and the development of documentary editing as a discipline allows for more faithful renditions of the texts. And in the nearly 60 years since the publication of Collected Works, many new Lincoln documents have been discovered, providing new opportunities for historical scholarship. includes interview with Director and Editor Daniel W. Stowell With these reasons likely in mind, Lincoln biographer David Herbert Donald assessed, \\"Though Roy Basler and his associates did an excellent job of editing Lincoln's writings a generation ago, I believe that it is time for a new, complete, updated edition of his works.\\" Project purpose and history From 1985 to 2000, the Lincoln Legal Papers searched county, state, and federal records for documents relating to legal cases handled by Lincoln or his partnerships. Images of more than 96,000 documents, arranged by case, were published in DVD-ROM format as The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Edition (University of Illinois Press, 2000). In 2009, that publication went online as The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Second Edition. It features all of the documents from the DVD edition, plus an additional 45 cases, 12 non-litigation activities, and nearly 1,300 new documents, as well as updated color images of more than 1,500 documents, many written by Lincoln. The selective 4-volume print edition of this series, The Papers of Abraham Lincoln: Legal Documents and Cases (University of Virginia Press, 2008), provides transcribed and annotated documents from 65 of Lincoln's most significant and representative cases, with additional chapters documenting his travels on the Eighth Judicial Circuit and other aspects of Lincoln‚Äôs life as a lawyer. In 2001, the Lincoln Legal Papers was expanded beyond Lincoln‚Äôs legal practice and transformed into The Papers of Abraham Lincoln. The project is a department within the Research Division of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. Beginning in 2003, teams of researchers visited private and public repositories around the U.S. and in several foreign countries, searching for, identifying, and scanning thousands of documents. The Papers of Abraham Lincoln has identified over 70,000 documents written by and to Lincoln in repositories and collections around the world. The major purpose of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln is \\"to preserve all of Lincoln's correspondence (both incoming and outgoing) and speeches with digital images, to provide authoritative transcriptions of those documents, to offer historical context for each document through annotation, and to make the images and transcriptions freely available over the Internet.\\" In 2003, Richard Norton Smith, presidential historian and founding director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, said, \\"It is hard to imagine a more valuable or enduring contribution to Lincoln studies than a new, comprehensive, scholarly and widely accessible edition of his papers.\\"  Digital library  April 19, 2018 marked the beginning of online publication of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln. It is composed of a Digital Edition and a Digital Archive. The Digital Edition includes transcriptions and images of documents written by or to Abraham Lincoln, presented in a searchable format. All documents in the Digital Edition are transcribed, single-proofed, and annotated; the transcriptions are orally double-proofed; and all annotation is fact-checked. The Digital Archive, released simultaneously with the Digital Edition, includes printed reports of speeches; routine government documents signed by Lincoln, such as military commissions; legislative documents from the Illinois General Assembly and Congress not authored by Abraham Lincoln; and other government documents (such as court-martial files) that were under Lincoln‚Äôs purview but for which we cannot positively prove direct interaction. The first online release of material included every known Lincoln document through 1842, when his career in the Illinois General Assembly ended. This amounted to 340 documents written by or to Lincoln and 4,839 documents that provide context on what issues Lincoln faced as a lawyer and legislator. The first document was a small workbook that Lincoln used as a schoolboy. Among the last was a letter in which Lincoln, who had recently broken up with Mary Todd, called himself \\"the most miserable man living.\\" Funding agencies and endorsements The Papers of Abraham Lincoln is a project of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. The Center for State Policy and Leadership at the University of Illinois-Springfield was a long-time co- sponsor of the project with additional funding at various times coming from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, the Shelby Cullom Davis Charitable Fund and the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation. A number of private contributors, including Iron Mountain Inc., also support the project. The National Endowment for the Humanities designated the Papers of Abraham Lincoln as a We the People project in 2004. This designation recognizes projects that enhance the study and understanding of American history. The National Historical Publications and Records Commission, the granting agency of the National Archives, endorsed the Papers of Abraham Lincoln in May 2008. The project also received an endorsement from the Illinois Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission.

Clef des plantes sarmenteuses rustiques en Belgique. Taxonomania 11:1-26 Description It is a vigorous, large evergreen climber, self-clinging by aerial roots. The stems are reddish, partly decorated with stellate hairs or scales, reddish-starred with about 15 rays. The leaves are alternate and simple. As in other Hedera species, the fertile branches have stiff stems with leaves having usually fewer lobes compared to the sterile (juvenile) stems. The main part of the leaf (the lamina) is oval-rhombic, 12‚Äì20 cm by 5‚Äì12 cm on flowering branches and coarsely toothed or slightly lobed (3-5 lobes) on the sterile stems. The inflorescence is a cluster of 13-15 pubescent flowers. Small flowers in umbels develop only on the fertile stems or branches. The plant contains the glycoside hederagenin, mostly in the leaves and berries, which could cause a mild toxicosis. If these parts are ingested it may cause severe discomfort, and handling plants may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction. The plant is rejected by herbivorous animals. Variegated cultivars of Hedera algeriensis are widely used in gardening. It naturalizes in mild climates and lowlands. The cultivar 'Ravensholst' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Ecology It may be a noxious weed or be invasive. It requires consistently moist soil, but is more resistant to environmental dryness than most related species and can stand drought better than other ivies. It tolerates low temperatures better than island species of similar latitudes, such as Hedera canariensis, Hedera maderensis, Hedera azorica, or Hedera cypria. It is native to the North African coast and coastal mountains where the climate is cooler and condensation provides a more humid habitat. It is frost sensitive at about the -2 ¬∞C winter isotherm but can become naturalised in mild climates. Hedera algeriensis arose from a common ancestor in the cloud forest habitat in the Mediterranean area. The northern African Hedera and northeast Atlantic species of the genus Hedera are closely related species. Until recently it was thought there was a single species,http://asignatura.us.es/abotcam/especies/Hedera_maroccana.html Hedera helix, but recent studies have shown that there are several species that differ mainly by microscopic details of the hairiness of the buds. Hedera maroccana, Hedera iberica, and Hedera canariensis are closely related. Landscaping Hedera algeriensis has been cultivated in Britain since 1838.

History and profile Cambio 16 was first published as a weekly in September 1971 and played an important media role during the Spanish political transition from the Francoist State to democracy. The editors originally wanted to name it Cambio, but the government insisted on a longer title before allowing it to be registered, so it was changed to Cambio 16 in honor of the magazine's sixteen founders.Jos√© Mar√≠a D√≠az Dorronsoro, \\"Los or√≠genes del semanario pol√≠tico Cambio 16 (1971-1974)\\", Comunicaci√≥n y Sociedad 23 (2), 2010, p. 57.

The headquarters of Cambio 16 is in Madrid. The magazine is similar to Time and Newsweek in terms of its content. It also publishes issues in Catalonia under the name Canvi Setze and in the Basque Country as Aldaketa Hamasei. The first director of Cambio 16 was Juan Tom√°s de Salas from 1972 until 1976 when he was replaced by Jos√© Oneto who ran the magazine until 1986.

While a large number of people in Arunkhola rely on business, its economy is still mainly based on agriculture, service and trade. There are big markets all around Arunkhola. There is also a big community of ex-servicemen of the British and Indian Army, an ex-service men colony in the south of Arunkhola. Arunkhola is about 3 km north of Narayani river and Charkoshe Jhhadi - the largest forest of Nepal and the home of wild animals such as Rhinos, Tigers, etc. There are two banks and some small co-operatives in operation. The villages around Arunkhola are Bhiuran, Kusunde, Tamaspur, Belhani, Khayarsal, Karamghari and Charikun. Arunkhola being a relatively new town, it is possible to see people from almost all parts of Nepal in Arunkhola. Population According to the 2011 Census 4265 people lives in 1028 households. This includes 1926 males and 2339 females.http://umeshg.com.np/district-wise- population-of-nepal-cbs-2011/  Schools  * Shree Janata Higher Secondary School (public) * Shree Janata Secondary School (public) * Shree Aarungkhola Secondary Boarding School (private) * Shree Narayani Boarding School (private) * Shree Shantideep Boarding School( private) * Little Step Academy (private) * Nepal Open University ;HEALTH * Manu Hospital *Mini Princeton Hospital *Nepal Public Hospital *City Hospital *Arunkhola Medical College *WHO INTL.

Two Arkansas units received the designation 14th. The other 14th Arkansas Infantry Regiment was commanded by Colonel James H. McCarver. The unit participated in the Pea Ridge Campaign in Arkansas and then moved east of the Mississippi River, with General Earl Van Dorn's Army of the West. After participating in the Iuka-Corinth Campaign, the unit became part of the garrison of Port Hudson, Louisiana. Following the surrender of Port Hudson, the unit returned to Arkansas and was consolidated with other units that had been released following their capture to form the 1st Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment (Trans-Mississippi).  Organization  14th (Powers') Arkansas Infantry was composed of ten companies from Carroll, Fulton, Izard, Marion, Newton and Searcy counties, which were mustered into service in July 1861 at Camp Adams, near Yellville, Arkansas. There were originally 939 officers and men mustered into the regiment. The driving force behind the organization of the regiment was State Senator William C. Mitchell, who notified the Governor that he had gathered his own company and nine other companies at Yellville, and was ready and able for service. The Governor accepted their services, and the State Military Board assigned Mitchell's regiment the designation of 14th Arkansas Regiment. There are practically no surviving regimental records of the 14th Arkansas' first year of service. The muster-in rolls were never sent to the Confederate War Department at Richmond, and the regiment's copies of the records were lost at the Battle of Pea Ridge, where the wagon containing the adjutant's portable desk was lost, burnt or captured. Thus, nothing comprehensive is known about the original members of the regiment, or deaths, discharges, promotions, etc. The regiment's records, for all practical purposes, begin in May 1862, when the 14th Arkansas was reorganized for the war. The regiment was composed of volunteers, despite being drawn from a part of the State with many Union sympathizers. The 14th Arkansas was very poorly armed with a bewildering variety of shotguns, old flint-lock muskets, and almost every kind of muzzle- loading musket and pistol available. Many of the men went to war only with home-made knives and tomahawks. They had no uniforms, wearing instead their homespun clothing, and virtually no accoutrements or camp equipment. Despite all these drawbacks, the 14th Arkansas Regiment was mustered into service at Yellville in August 1861, for a period of twelve months. The field officers were Col. William C. Mitchell, Lieut. Col. Eli Dodson, and Maj. John Allen. The names of the original company commanders are not known. The company commanders listed are those elected when the unit was reorganized in 1862. The regiment was organized with volunteer companies from the following counties: Colonel William Christmas Mitchell was a State Senator from Carroll and later Marion Counties, who was largely responsible for organizing the 14th Arkansas *Company A ‚Äì Commanded by Captain William C.

Love, organized in Searcy County, on August 5, 1861.  Battles  After being mustered into service, Brig. Gen. William J. Hardee, commanding Confederate forces in northeast Arkansas, refused to accept the poorly armed and completely untrained 14th Arkansas into his command. Hardy had neither the arms to equip them, nor the time to train them. As a result, the regiment waited patiently in camp. However, Brig. Gen. Ben McCulloch, commanding Confederate forces in northwest Arkansas, badly needed more men, since Brig. Gen. Nicholas B. Pearce had just disbanded all of the Arkansas State Troops in McCulloch's command. McCulloch invited the 14th Arkansas to join him and provided the regiment with about 300 modern muskets. The 14th Arkansas took part in the Battle of Pea Ridge, and performed quite well in that confusing battle, in which Gen. McCulloch was himself killed. The names of the regiment's dead are also mostly unknown, due of the loss of the regiment's records. We know from Union reports that Colonel Mitchell and more than 30 of his men were captured by their enemy. Following the battle, the 14th Arkansas, along with the rest of Major General Earl Van Dorn's Army of the West, was ordered to Mississippi. The regiment reported 17 casualties out of the 116 men engaged at the Battle of Iuka, and 12 wounded and 2 missing in the fighting at Corinth. The regiment was reorganized on May 8, 1862 at Camp Churchill Clark, near Corinth, Mississippi, and new company muster rolls were made and copies sent to Richmond. This reorganization was to prove a troublesome period for the regiment. The reason for the army-wide reorganization in May 1862 was the Conscription Act enacted by the Confederate Congress the previous month.UPTON, EMORY, Bvt. Maj. Gen., United States Army; \\"THE MILITARY POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES\\" WASHINGTON GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE 1912, Page 471, Congressional edition, Volume 6164, Google Books, Accessed 4 November 2011, https://books.google.com/books?id=2-tGAQAAIAAJ&pg;=PA471&lpg;=PA471&dq;=Confederate+conscription+law+reorganization+regiment&source;=bl&ots;=7ptDBF0n2D&sig;=-K_6PQoHglmh_SOzuobv_JyNWUw&hl;=en#v=onepage&q;=Confederate%20conscription%20law%20reorganization%20regiment&f;=false All twelve-month regiments had to re-muster and enlist for two years or the duration of the war; a new election of officers was ordered; and men who were exempted from service by age or other reasons under the Conscription Act were allowed to take a discharge and go home. The reorganization was accomplished among the other Arkansas regiments in and around Corinth, but it basically destroyed the 14th Arkansas Regiment. The regimental officers apparently did not make clear to the men just what was happening. Most of the officers declined to stand for re-election, resigned their commissions, and quietly left camp. After the men elected their new officers, they were informed that, by participating in the election, they were agreeing to the extension of their term of service from twelve months to two years or the war. The men reacted poorly and felt that they had been cheated. A large percentage of the regiment up and left camp en masse on June 3, 1862. These men were not motivated by cowardice or dereliction of duty. They were deeply aggrieved over, as they saw it, being lied to and misled by their officers. If Colonel Mitchell had not been captured at Pea Ridge, things may have turned out differently. Mitchell was a popular and extremely well-liked and respected commander. He almost certainly would have handled the reorganization differently. His successor was Col. Eli Dodson but shortly after Dodson was assigned to duty as regimental commander on May 23, 1862, his regiment just melted through his fingers. The great majority of the men who deserted in the flap over their term of service, went home and immediately enlisted in Shaler's 27th Arkansas Infantry Regiment for a term of service of three years or the war! So the dispute with those fiercely independent mountaineers was not the term of service, per se, simply the fact that they had had no say in the matter. By enlisting in a new regiment, they, not a bunch of lying officers, decided how long they would serve. Honor and independence were thus preserved, and most of the former 14th Arkansas soldier served honorably and valiantly for the rest of the war. Back in Mississippi, what remained of the 14th Arkansas, with its numbers reduced to less than 200 officers and men, was basically combat-ineffective. The regiment's roster shrank from nearly 1,000 men to less than 300 in a period of about two months. At the battle of Iuka, on September 19, 1862, the 14th Arkansas was only able to muster 116 officers and men. Much of the problem can be attributed to lack of meaningful leadership. When the regiment reorganized at Corinth on May 16, 1862, the popular Colonel Mitchell was still a prisoner of war, so he was dropped from the rolls, and Eli Dodson was elected colonel in his place. Colonel Dodson was never able to solve the regiment's serious morale problem, and he eventually resigned. Major-General Van Dorn then appointed Frank P. Powers to assume command of the 14th Arkansas, but the Confederate Senate refused to confirm the appointment, stating that Van Dorn had exceeded his authority, that a regimental commander had to be elected. The regiment was used to obtain replacements for other commands. In September 1862, for example, several of the 14th Arkansas soldiers were transferred to the 27th Texas Cavalry to fill out the ranks of an under-strength company. Recruiting parties sent back to Arkansas were detained by General Hindman and attached to regiments in the Trans-Mississippi Department. The regiment fought at Corinth in October 1862, and acquitted itself well in that battle. Later it was assigned to General Beall's Brigade, Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana and assigned to the garrison of Port Hudson. Due to the unit's losses, it underwent several field consolidations with other units while assigned to the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana. Field consolidations were considered to be temporary, and the component regiments continued to maintain separate muster rolls.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: Camp Price, MS\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 16 December 2004, Accessed 22 May 2012, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/arch_config.pl?read=9205 On January 7, 1863 Major General Franklin Gardner issued General Order No. 5 which temporarily consolidated several under strength Arkansas units: 18th, and 23rd Arkansas Regiments to oppose Union attacks, May 27, 1863. The order was modified in February 1863 and the 14th Arkansas was placed in a consolidated regiment with the 23rd and 18th Arkansas Infantry Regiments. Logan's consolidated regiment consisted of the 11th and the Griffith's 17th Arkansas. The Johnson's 15th Arkansas was assigned to Crockett's consolidated regiment instead of the 17th. The regiment endured forty-eight day siege, and was surrendered to General Nathaniel P. Banks on July 9, 1863. The unit was involved in the following engagements: *Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, March 6‚Äì8, 1862. *Iuka-Corinth Campaign, September to October 1862. *Battle of Iuka, September 19, 1862. *Battle of Corinth, October 3‚Äì4, 1862. *Siege of Port Hudson, May‚ÄìJuly 1863. Following the surrender of Port Hudson, the officers were sent as prisoners to Johnson's Island while the enlisted men were paroled spent the winter of 1863-1864 in parole camps in southern Arkansas awaiting their official exchange.  Consolidation and Surrender  After being exchanged, the 14th Arkansas was consolidated with the 15th Northwest Arkansas, 16th Arkansas, and 21st Arkansas Infantry Regiments to form the 1st Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment (Trans-Mississippi). The consolidated regiment was assigned along with the 2nd Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment and to the 2nd (McNair's) Arkansas Brigade, 1st (Churchill's) Arkansas Division, 2nd Corps, Trans-Mississippi Department, from September 1864 to May 1865. This regiment was surrendered with the Department of the Trans-Mississippi, General Kirby Smith commanding, May 26, 1865. When the Trans-Mississippi Department surrendered, all of the Arkansas infantry regiments were encamped in and around Marshall, Texas (war-ravaged Arkansas no longer able to subsist the army). The regiments were ordered to report to Shreveport, Louisiana, to be paroled. None of them did so. Some soldiers went to Shreveport on their own to be paroled, but for the most part, the regiments simply disbanded without formally surrendering and the men made their way home.

The house and its gatehouse are each separately Grade I listed buildings. Buildings The construction of Nettlestead Place began c. 1250-60 with additions added c. 1438 and c. 1589 and in the 1920s. The two-storey house is built of local ragstone, galletted on the ground floor of the main section and more randomly coursed on the first floor. The 15th- and 20th-century extensions are without galletting. Having been used for two centuries as an oast house, it was restored and extended for use as a house in the 1920s. The main wing of the house, aligned east-west, is the oldest part and contains the original 13th- century construction with the 15th-century extension on its eastern end. The south elevation, facing a square pond, is divided into four unequal sections by projecting bays probably constructed as garderobes with small windows at the first floor. the sections between the projections feature a series of five 15th-century paired windows at first floor with moulded stone architraves and mullions. Smaller windows occur in the ground floor, and at the east (right) end of the wing is a doorway over which stone carvings of shields carry the date \\"AD 1589\\". The west and east ends of the wing are gabled, with the west end rebuilt as part of the 1920s works which included chimney stacks added at both ends of the wing. On the east end, the 1920s extension is two storeys with an attic floor, but with lower eaves and ridge heights and dormer windows. It is slightly set back from the earlier wing. The 1920s construction extends north as a two-storey east wing with the attic floor and dormer windows continuing. It terminates with a short north wing set at a right angle, each end of which is gabled. On the north side of the original wing, at its junction with the east wing is a gabled 1920s stair turret probably occupying the location of an earlier stair turret. The north side of the original wing features a pair of two-storey gabled bays set in from the ends, between which the roof continues down to eaves above the ground floor. Internally, the older part of the house contains a number of original structural features including moulded details to window surrounds and 13th- and 15th-century doorways. The early 14th-century gatehouse stands to the west of the house at the start of the private drive. It is a two-storey structure with a roughly coursed ragstone ground floor and a half-timbered first floor jettied to the west and spanning the roadway on timber Bressumer beams. The roof is of clay tiles and is gabletted and features crown post construction.

On July 30, 2011, the Astros called up Martinez to replace Hunter Pence, whom they had traded to the Philadelphia Phillies.

In July 2013, hitting coach John Mallee informed Martinez that he did not have the proper swing to become an impact hitter in the major leagues. The next month, he was in the trainer's room after spraining his left wrist, watching ESPN highlights of Ryan Braun batting, and realized his swing did not resemble Braun's. From there, Martinez began to study other top hitters including Albert Pujols and Miguel Cabrera and to investigate what modifications he could make to his swing to become a more successful hitter. He was outrighted off the Astros roster on November 20, 2013. After three years in an Astro uniform, he had hit .251 with 24 home runs amid progressively declining production.

He was a candidate for Governor of Massachusetts in 1986, but dropped out of the race due to allegations of forging names on his nomination papers, having ties to organized crime, and erratic personal behavior. Early life and political involvement Hyatt was born and raised in Methuen, Massachusetts. His father was a local doctor. In 1971 he graduated from Central Catholic High School in Lawrence, Massachusetts. He was class valedictorian. Hyatt attended Yale University, where he was a member of the Yale Debate Association and the floor leader of the Party of the Right in the Yale Political Union. In 1979 he graduated from Boston College Law School and began practicing law. Proposition 2¬Ω Hyatt served as executive director of Citizens for Limited Taxation from 1979 to 1980. He was one of the architects of Proposition 2¬Ω, a ballot measure that limits property tax increases by Massachusetts municipalities and traveled the state to drum up support for the measure. During the Reagan administration, Hyatt worked in the Department of Education and the Small Business Administration. 1984 congressional race Hyatt's political career began in 1984 when he was a candidate for the 5th congressional district. He defeated Thomas P. Tierney for the Republican nomination and faced Democratic State Senator Chester G. Atkins in the general election. In a heavily Democratic district, Hyatt was able to finish a close second to Atkins. Anti-seat belt law activism In 1985, Hyatt, along with radio host Jerry Williams, led the effort to gather signatures to place a measure to repeal Massachusetts' mandatory seat belt law on the 1986 ballot. The question made it to the ballot and would be passed by the voters. 1986 gubernatorial election On March 13, 1986, Hyatt became the first Republican to enter the gubernatorial race. Hyatt ran on a platform of limiting state taxes, bringing back the death penalty, providing state aid to private schools, and competency testing and merit pay for teachers. He opposed the state law that made wearing a seat belt mandatory, the use of roadblocks to crack down on drunken driving, busing, and the use of public funds for abortions. Shortly before the Republican convention in April 1986, Associated Builders and Contractors, a group of Massachusetts builders and contractors that had hired Hyatt as a consultant on a petition drive, announced that they had fired him for ineffectuality and erratic behavior, including staring off into space, heavy coffee drinking, talking on the phone when no one was on the other end, and twice appearing naked before a secretary in his office. At the convention, Hyatt was challenged by former Metropolitan District Commissioner Guy Carbone, and state representative Royall H. Switzler, who was drafted at the convention by anti-Hyatt Republicans. After a strong showing for Switzler on the first ballot (891 votes for Hyatt, 775 votes for Switzler, 258 votes for Carbone), some of Hyatt's major supporters, including Ray Shamie and Papa Gino's founder Michael Valerio, announced that they would not oppose Switzler's nomination. On the second ballot, Switzler won the nomination with 975 votes to Hyatt's 876 and Carbone's 60. Despite losing the nomination, Hyatt chose to stay in the race and run against Switzler in the Republican primary. During the campaign, Hyatt and his aides were investigated by the Massachusetts Attorney General's office on charges for forging names on his nomination papers. He was also recorded discussing politics and accepting a cash gift from New England mobster George Kattar on a Federal Bureau of Investigation wiretap. Charges were not brought against him in either case. In June, Switzler dropped out of the race after inaccuracies about his military record were revealed, leaving Hyatt the only Republican candidate for Governor. On July 14, Hyatt dropped out of the race. Despite dropping out, Hyatt won the Republican primary. He declined the nomination and write-in candidate George Kariotis was declared the nominee. Hyatt later stated he declined the nomination because Valerio and former Governor John A. Volpe promised to retire his campaign debts in exchange for not accepting the party's nomination, which they never followed up on. Ann Kramer, a Republican State Committee member who was at the meeting with Hyatt, Valerio, Volpe, and other party leaders stated that they agreed to help Hyatt raise money to help him repay his debt, but did not promise to retire it entirely. Later life In November 1989, Hyatt gave his first interview after dropping out of the election. Hyatt described himself as still being in a \\"state of emotional shock\\" and feeling \\"gypped and violated\\". At the time of the interview he had been unable to find work for several months, was living off of a stipend provided to him by his father, going through a divorce, and undergoing psychological counseling. Since the election, Hyatt had gained 35 pounds and grew a mustache. That same year, Hyatt sued Associated Builders and Contractors and its former executive Stephen Tocco for slander. During the suit it was revealed that Hyatt's psychiatrist had described him as having narcissistic personality disorder and having been in \\"hypomanic stages.\\" Most of his defamation suit was dismissed, however the court allowed Hyatt's charge that Associated Builders had defamed him by claiming he had been fired stand (Hyatt contended that he was not fired, but quit). In September 1993, the case was settled out of court. In 1992, Hyatt changed his voter registration to Democrat so he could vote for Paul Tsongas in the Democratic presidential primary. He also voted for Marty Meehan in that year's United States House of Representatives election. While he described himself as \\"still basically a conservative\\" he also stated that he \\"believe[d] societies should be judged by how they treat their less fortunate\\". In 1992, Hyatt was elected to the Methuen Charter Commission. In 1993 and 2003, he was an unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of Methuen. Hyatt ran a website, thebulldogedition.com, where he wrote about politics in Massachusetts and Methuen. The site was described by Boston Globe columnist Alex Beam as \\"belligerent\\" and \\"off-the-wall\\". A portion of the website had to be taken down due to a judge's order. As he did not have a computer, Hyatt updated the site from the Nevins Memorial Library in Methuen. In a 2005 Boston Globe column, Hyatt was described as occasionally working as a political or media consultant, on probation for making hostile threats, not having a car or computer, being in poor health, and described his living situation by stating \\"I bounce around\\". Hyatt said that he saw himself as a good candidate to host a talk show. He also stated that he rekindled his religious faith. He later moved to Amesbury, Massachusetts. In 2007, he was a leader in the effort to get Proposition 1, a proposed initiative petition that would which would cap increases in property tax levies to 1% a year and eliminate the auto excise tax, on the ballot. On September 26, 2007 he was disbarred by the Board of Bar Overseers for \\"serious crimes\\", including intimidation of a witness and violating a protective order.

Ethnic Theater and the Immigrant  Comparative Study on ethnic stages in the United States show ethnic stage activity spanning over a century and a half. Ethnic stages were created by and for immigrants themselves coming from Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Ethnic stages resonated strongly with immigrants because it reflected on their concerns and experiences. Ethnic stages were primarily designed to have immigrant-themed works for recently arrived immigrant audiences. Through the ethnic stage, immigrants maintained and expanded their cultural memory. Immigrant influence on American society can be pinpointed to places like Swede Town (Chicago); Little Germany (New York); Little Italy (New York); and chinatown (San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles). Despite the overt, clear presence of immigrant communities all over America, the ethnic stage was hidden and closed-off from outsiders. Those not part of specific ethnic communities were not aware or interested in that community's theater. Ethnic theater was undermined by immigrants themselves. First generation immigrants preferred plays in their homeland language while second generation immigrants favored mainstream theater in the English- language. Despite this division, ethnic theater prospered in the face of continuous mass immigration, lasting several decades or a century. Immigrants and their descendants never completely lost interest in ethnic theater but with the advent of film, immigrants, like their American counterparts attended American Motion Pictures, providing them insight into their new home and assimilating them. The vaudeville was also another competing form of entertainment eager to lure in immigrants as audience members. The vaudeville and the ethnic theater played different social functions. Ethnic stages such as Yiddish and Italian theater sought to preserve cherished aspects of old- world culture. Through the celebration of shared values, ethnic theaters gave immigrants a sense of community and solidarity in the face of increasingly chaotic and diverse every day life in the city. Vaudevilles, on the other hand, served to interpret ethnic communities via ethnic caricatures through comedy. At times, ethnic communities protested their caricatures in the vaudeville but nonetheless were among the audience members of the vaudeville. Just like ethnic theater, the vaudeville offered a glimpse of immigrant life though, the vaudeville heavily stressed ethnic caricatures. Immigrants were drawn to the vaudeville primarily because these ethnic caricatures though unfavorable, bore a realistic resemblance to the immigrants and they would encounter on the streets and neighborhoods.  As a German Theater  In 1893, Polish immigrant, Heinrich Conried changed the theater's name to Irving Place Theater. He worked as a director and manager, establishing the theater's success and financial stability until 1903. Though Conried aimed to primarily attract New York's German-speaking population, not all were regular theatre- goers, so he devised a program with a frequent change of bill to expand his audience. Each week he presented three or more different plays ranging from classics to comedies, and his theater was acclaimed for having a varied repertory. Musical plays were also presented, especially those popular on German stages such as Kumarker und Picarde and Das Versprechen hinter‚Äôm Herd (The Promise Behind the Hearth). Conried sought to expand and educate his audience through the institution of an outreach program in eastern universities, providing performances of the German classics and comedies to students from Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, and Columbia. Through this program, students were encouraged to regularly attend the Irving Place Theater. In 1901, sponsored by Yale's German Department, Conried's company performed Lessing's Minna von Barheim in New Haven. In 1903, after being manager at the Irving Place for ten years, Conried took directorship of the Metropolitan Opera but would still continue as director of the Irving place until he fell ill and resigned in 1908. The Irving Place Theater like other German Theaters were undermined by their commitment to produce classic German drama and their desire to give in to mainstream American demands by merely producing German versions of popular American theater. The German theater's audience was also torn by first and second generation Germans.The type of repertory offered by theaters was a critical factor in determining the type of audience. The first generation sought to watch traditional or classic repertory and the Americanized second generation preferred popular farces. Because first generation and second generation sought to watch different things, Conried devised varied program at Irving Place where he included both high-end classics and popular farces in order to diversify and expand his audience. In theory, however, Conried had envisioned a theater solely dedicated to serious drama, connecting back to German roots. In his 1898 speech, celebrating his twenty-fifth anniversary of his theatrical career, Conried expresses that German theater should be ‚Äúa reflection of the dramatic literature of the old fatherland, and in that way to be the first and most powerful pillar for the cultivation and maintenance of German culture in America‚Äù. Nonetheless, the German theater was constantly divided since first and second generation immigrants sought different repertories. Peter Conolly- Smith examines the German theater's demise in a study, conveying that the German theater's collapse in American culture had little to do with the animosities against German immigrants produced by World War I and more to do with German theater's assimilation into American culture. Actor Rudolf Christians took over of Irving Place Theater in 1913 as director of the company alongside two other manager-directors until 1918 when the company disbanded. Christian's vision similarly aligned with that of Conried's. They both sought to present great modern plays and the classics. Under Christians, for the first time in the U.S, George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion was presented in German. Both Christians and Conried desired to attract non-German speakers as their audience though at the core of their audience were German immigrants. Under Christians, the New York Times remarked on how the Irving Place Theater embodied German patriotism in the U.S before America's entrance into the war. After America's involvement, German patriotism decreased because Germany had become America's enemy, and in 1918 the Irving Place Theater was driven to its demise as a German company. The collapse of the Irving Place theater like any other German theater was caused by various many factors: anti-German prejudice, German America's lack of interest in the German stage, and other competing forms of entertainment such as films, English-language theater, and the vaudeville.  As a Yiddish Theater  By 1910 Yiddish theater was flourishing on the Lower East Side in New York City, and Yiddish companies had taken over many German theaters on the Bowery; from the late 1910s to the early 1920s, Yiddish theater gradually moved northward, first to Second Avenue and then to Irving Place and East 16th Street, reflecting the beginning dispersion of the East European immigrant Jewish community. The Irving Place theater came under the management of Jewish actor, director, and producer Maurice Schwartz in 1918, and he changed the name to the new Yiddish Art Theater. His new theater thrived until it is disbanded in 1950. Yiddish Theater began in Europe in the early 18th century and came to the United States with mass Eastern European immigration, thriving primarily in New York City from the late 19th to mid-20th century. The idea to establish a Yiddish theater came from the immigrant community who wanted to combat the effects of shund (trash) popular entertainment. For the immigrant community, Yiddish theater offered entertainment, an escape, and reminisces of immigrant life and home traditions. When the theater opened for the first time as the new Yiddish Art Theater on August 30, 1918, it did not find huge success. Zalmen Libibin's Man and his Shadow, did not meet audience and critic expectations. The new theater would find success with Peretz Hershbein's The Forgotten Nook and The Blacksmith's Daughter, both of which emphasized on the idyllic, village life, something that resonated strongly with immigrants. The Yiddish Art theater at Irving Place, like other Yiddish theaters, rejected popular, sentimental and melodramatic improvisations, and instead focused on quality by carefully rehearsing plays, ensemble, acting, and presentation. Yiddish theater was an entertainment of cultural exchange. Through the translations of classics, immigrants could learn about world literature; through the translation of popular American theater, immigrants could americanize. After World War I, Yiddish theater in America began to show signs of a struggling show business. Restricted immigration and a demographic movement away from New York City's old neighborhoods affected the Yiddish theater's prosperity. Ever-increasing assimilation by immigrants continually pushed Yiddish language and Yiddish theater out America. English words made their way into Yiddish dialogue while American mainstream productions influenced Yiddish productions. Just like had occurred in German theaters, the younger generation of immigrants preferred English-language, americanized theater, shows and films. With time, the Yiddish theater's audience decreased, and Yiddish plays were placed on limited runs. Just as in theater in general, the Yiddish theater's demise would come with the spread of film and television. The domination of Hebrew also drove out Yiddish language and Yiddish theater. Hitler and Stalin were responsible for the waning of Yiddish culture. They destroyed old world sources and texts of Yiddish language and culture. Nonetheless, today there are Jewish organizations and centers that sponsor theater-related events. And many are still interested in making Yiddish theater accessible especially since Yiddish theater still resonates with American Jews because it carries memories of their ancestors and cultural traditions. In culture The theater is the setting for the 2013 fictional play, The Nance.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Saranathan and his consort Lakshmi as Saranayaki. It is believed that Saranathan appeared for Cauvery, the river goddess, who performed penance at this place. The temple is believed to be of significant antiquity with contributions at different times from Medieval Cholas, Vijayanagar Empire and Madurai Nayaks. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines and three of the four bodies of water. The rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower has five tiers and raises to a height of . The temple is unique where the presiding deity Vishnu has five consorts. It has also a shrine dedicated to river Cauvery, which is unique feature among all Vishnu temples. Saranathan is believed to have appeared to river Cauvery, sage Markandeya and Hindu gods Indra. Six daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the chariot festival, celebrated during the Tamil month of Chittirai (March‚ÄìApril), is the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend As per Hindu legend, when time came to destroy the world and finish the yuga, Brahma was worried a lot. He pleaded Vishnu to tell him a way to keep the tools necessary for Srishti and all vedas safely. Vishnu ordered him to put all these things in a strong mud pot and after trying mud from all places Brahma finally made a pot out of the sand taken from Thirucherai and saved all Vedas and all necessary aids for creation. Hence as this placed gave the magical mud which held a lead role this place became the reason for all living things to live even after the Maha pralaya so this place is called \\"Sara Shetram\\". Among all rivers, there was a question on who was superior. All the rivers approached the Hindu god of creation, Brahma. He said that during the Vamana avatar, Vishnu appeared as dwarf and later became Trivikrama to the king Mahabali. He placed his third feet on the demon king and cleansed Ganga by placing his foot on it. Based on the narration, Brahma quoted that Ganga was the holiest of all rivers. River Cauvery wanted her status to be equal to river Ganges and performed a severe penance. To test her devotion, Vishnu appeared in the form of a child in front of her. Realising the anonymity, Cauvery treated the child with care and motherly devotion. Vishnu was pleased with her devotion and revealed all his ten avatars to her and asked her to visit Sara Kshetram and have a holy dip in the Sara Pushkarani. He also granted her the boon during the Tula month (October - November) that she would be considered superior to Ganges. History Image of the temple towers There are two inscriptions in the temple from the period of Chola Parakesari Varman (906-946 AD) and Babasahib of Madavipallam (1728‚Äì38) indicating various grants to the temple. The temple is believed to be of significant antiquity with contributions at different times from Medieval Cholas, Vijayanagar Empire and Madurai Nayaks. The crown of some of the images from the Chola period show influence of Buddhist tradition in the region. The metal image of Sita is believed to be a classic example of Chola Art during the 9th-10th centuries. After the fall of the Vijayanagar empire in Tanjore, Azhagiya Manavala Naicker who ruled Tanjore planned to erect a temple for Rajagopala swamy in Mannarkudi. He appointed his minister Narasa Boopalan for this job. He was to get Blackstones from all possible places. This minister was a great worshipper of Saranatha Perumal of Thirucherai and wanted to erect a temple for him too. So he ordered his men to unload one stone from each cart which passed Thirucherai. A spy of the king caught hold of this and informed the king. The angered king came for an inspection. But before that in overnight Narasa Boopalan constructed this temple and to please the king he added a shrine for Rajagopala swamy. His plan worked and he was saved from the king's anger after that the king ordered to complete the temple with his money. Architecture Image of the temple towers The temple is long and wide. The temple has a temple tank in front of the temple with the same dimension. The five-tiered gopuram (temple tower) is tall and pierces the large compound wall around the temple. There is a second gopuram is three-storied and it is located in the first precinct around the sanctum. The presiding deity, Sarantha has a tall image in standing posture. The stone images of Cauvery and sage Markandeya are housed in the sanctum. The festival deity is accompanied by Bhudevi, Sridevi and Neeladevi. A small idol of Santhanakrishna and Selvar are also housed in the sanctum. The shrine of Saranatha's consort Saranayaki Thayar is located adjacent to the sanctum. The image of both the main idol and the festival image in the Thayar are depicted in seated posture. In the second precinct there is a Kalayana hall, where there is a shrine of Rajagoplaswamy. The images of Rukmini and Sathyabama are also housed in the same shrine. In front of the shrine, the shrine of Thiruvenkatamudayam is situated. There are separate shrines of Sri Rama, Narashima, Kaliyamardhana, Bala Saranatha, Senai Mudaliar, Ramanuja, Pillai Logachariar, Azhwars and Manavala Mamunigal in the temple. Mudikondan River flows from the west and Kudamurutti River in the south of the temple. There is a shrine of Hanuman from the west end of the temple tank and Vinayaka from the North eastern side. River Cauvery is seen in a maternal posture with a child on her lap. The temple is one of the few places where there is a separate shrine for river Cauvery. Festivals and religious practices Temple tree The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis based on Pancharatra Agama. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 10:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Saranatha Perumal and Saranayagi. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The major festival, the twelve-day Brahmotsavam is celebrated during the Tamil month of Thai (January - February). It is believed that it only on the auspicious day of Pushya star of the month that Vishnu descended from Vaikuntam to earth to bestow Cauvery. Rathotsavam, the temple car is drawn during the ninth day of the festival. The other Vaishnavite festivals like Krishna Janmashtami, Karthigai, Tamil New Year, Margazhi ten-day festival, Sankaranthi, Panguni Uthiram and Rohini Utsavam are celebrated. Religious significance The feet of Rama The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Thirumangai Azhwar in eleven hymns. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. He has mentioned about the devotees of Saranatha who are deeply immersed in Narayana consciousness. Divya Kavi Pillai Perumal Aiyangar in his Ashta Prabanda states that people should not waste their time glorifying wealthy men, but should laud the greatness of the almighty. This is the only Divya Desam where Vishnu is seen with five consorts. The temple is represented in five divine elements of Perumal, Nachiyar, Vimana, Theertha and land and hence called Tirucherai. A Chola king named Satyakeerthi is believed to have worshiped the presiding deity for child birth and was blessed with a son. During the coronation of Rama, the avatar of Vishnu, Vibishana was presented the sacrosanct Sri Ranga Vimana. He was carrying it all the way to his kingdom of Lanka and midway, to rest, he placed the image on the banks of Cauvery. After performing his routine pooja, he tried to lift the Vimana, but it could not be lifted. Mahavishnu appeared to him and said that he desired to stay as Ranganatha in the place, which went on to become Srirangam. Vishnu also desired to watch the Brahmotsavam at Tirucherai. The festivals of the temple are thus considered sacred. As per a local legend, the king of Thanjavur sent material through his minister Narcapapular to the Rajagopalaswamy Temple, Mannargudi, but the minister used the material to build the Thirucherai temple. The king came to know of this and wanted to punish the minister. The minister is believed to have prayed to Tirucherai deity to save him from the punishment. The king who came to the temple witnessed the form of Mannargudi temple in this temple and was pacified.

Biography Marangello was born on the Lower East Side, Manhattan in Knickerbocker Village and lived there until his incarceration in the 1990s. He was a small man with slicked back hair, thick glasses and a sharp nose. Because of his thick prescription glasses, it gave people the impression that he was always staring. Marangello was identified as a made member of the Bonanno family by the FBI since the 1960s and started as a personal driver for boss Joe Bonanno. He operated a prosperous large scale bookmaking and gambling operation in Brooklyn and later expanded to Manhattan. After Carmine Galante became boss of the Bonanno family, Marangello was promoted as underboss. He associated himself with the Sicilian faction of the Bonanno family and operated out of the Toyland Social Club located at 94 Hester Street in Chinatown, New York. He used Toyland as his personal office. He never had anyone visit the social club unless it was concerning business. He occupied the Toy Association hobbyist club from 12:30 to about 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon from Monday to Friday. Mobsters would come, take care of their business and then leave. He was underboss from 1974 to 1979 until Galante was murdered. Undercover FBI agent Joseph \\"Donnie Brasco\\" Pistone got to meet Marangello regularly to report the figures of Benjamin \\"Lefty\\" Ruggiero's weekly bookmaking operations. In the 1990s Marangello and longtime friend and Bonanno caporegime Michael Sabella were given a sentence of four to eight years stemming from Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act charges. After Marangello retired, he was replaced by Stefano Cannone. Marangello's most notorious loan shark customer was Bonanno street soldier Benjamin \\"Lefty\\" Ruggiero. Ruggiero was a degenerate gambler and by 1977 was indebted to Marangello for $160,000 from the horse races at the Aqueduct Racetrack. Ruggiero's gambling addiction was such that it delayed his induction into the Mafia as \\"made man.\\" Until he could pay his debt, Ruggiero could not be \\"made\\" and was therefore \\"put on the shelf.\\" By the summer of 1977, Ruggiero successfully paid back a majority of his debt to Nicholas and was finally initiated into the Bonanno family. By the following year in 1978 he had fallen back into debt again from his addiction. As a result, Marangello arranged to have a portion of his criminal operations to be directly applied to Ruggiero's enormous debt.

The lake is named after a prominent pioneering family which settled in the district in the early 1860s. It lies about south of Perth on the eastern side of the Harvey Estuary and forms part of the Peel-Yalgorup System Ramsar site. It is an important area for waders, or shorebirds, and is a well-known birdwatching site. Description The lake is oval and shallow with a gently sloping bed. Maximum open water coverage is an area of about (north-south) by (east-west). It lies in a natural depression in the coastal plain and is separated from the eastern shoreline of the Harvey Estuary by a vegetated fossil dune ridge some across. Flora and fauna Plants About 30 plant species have been recorded. There are stands of banbar and swamp paperbark fringing the northern and eastern margins, with a patchy understorey of broadleaf cumbungi. The south-western corner is dominated by pasture and the midsection of the western shore is open eucalypt woodland, including tuarts, flooded gums and swamp peppermints, with a grass understorey. Other species present include spearwood, golden-wreath wattle, Swan River peppermint and sheoaks. Six species of orchid have been recorded in the reserve, including pink fairy and cowslip orchids. Birds The exposed mudflats around the lake form essential feeding habitat for migratory waders. Some of the reserve has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it regularly supports over 1% of the world populations of red-necked stints, sharp-tailed sandpipers, white-headed stilts, red-necked avocets and red-capped plovers, and sometimes large numbers of blue-billed ducks.

Academic year The college's academic term is the semester. New students start arriving at the end of August each year and complete a few weeks of compulsory military training before beginning their studies. Returning students arrive to resume classes at the beginning of September. The Fall semester ends at the beginning of January. The Spring semester starts at the beginning of March and ends at the beginning of July. A few national holidays are observed each semester. Students typically spend the last week of each semester sitting exams. After exams are finished the students are required to vacate their dorms until the following semester. As a result, the campus is like a ghost town for most of January, February, July, and August although there are workers present and security personnel vigilant. Although it is a four-year institution, most students only attend classes the first three years. Come the fourth year, most students seek internships or employment and return periodically for examinations before graduation. A view of the campus courtyard from the northernmost lecture hall, Spring 2011 (est.). Student life Upon matriculation, the students are grouped together in classes that range in size between 30 and 160 students, depending on which major they have been assigned. These groups‚Äîor classes‚Äîattend the same courses at the same time with the same classmates for the duration of their college career. The courses that the students take and when they take them are decided and mandated by their department's administration. Attendance is mandatory. Many aspects of the students' lives are overseen by resident assistants and monitors. The students typically engage in very few extracurricular activities as their typical day is full of classes, study time, and sometimes mandatory group exercise (PE). Classes run Monday through Friday with possible commitments over the weekend. Class days are divided up into eight 45-minute academic hours with 10 and 20 minute breaks in between. The day starts at 08:00 and ends at 16:50. Everyone breaks for lunch at the same time, between 11:40 and 13:20. Students are required to live on campus in gender-restricted dormitories. Each dorm room houses 4-6 students. The students share public half baths with cold water only in the dormitories; they go to off-campus bath houses to bathe. There are laundry and hot water facilities in a facility adjacent the dormitories. The students have a curfew at night during which they must be in their dorm rooms and the power is turned off. There are computers on campus but their use is strictly limited to certain users. There is also a library, a study hall, and an auditorium used for orientations, assemblies, and events. There is a canteen on campus where the students can chow. The food is considered to be very basic but inexpensive. There are ATMs, a China Post office offering EMS service, China Mobile and China Unicom offices, and a \\"Western-style\\" fast food restaurant. There is a dry good store on campus between the dormitories. There are basketball, tennis, and badminton courts with some exercise equipment. There is also a soccer (football) field. Part of the student body participated in the campus ceremonies supporting the area's first International Swimsuit Festival in 2011. Academia The teaching staff ranges from semi-retired career academics to new teachers. Many reside on campus in private dorms or apartments. Economics, Art, Tourism, Trade, Chinese and English are among the major disciplines offered. Most of the classrooms have projectors, computers, and large flat screen TVs. There are also some listening labs for language students.

He succeeded founder James Dobson in 2005. In 2011 Daly was the main host of the Focus on the Family radio program.  Early life, influence, education and career  Daly grew up in Southern California. He was abandoned by his alcoholic father at age 5, and orphaned by his mother's death from cancer when he was 9. He was then placed in a foster home, initially in Morongo Valley California, until he moved in with his older brothers and then with his father, who eventually turned back to alcohol and died.

In 2009, the Denver Post reported that Daly shared Dobson's views in the public policy arena, but had taken a different approach from that of his predecessor.

According to reports about a decade ago: similar to Dobson, Daly and his colleagues opposed abortion and same-sex marriage, but also wished to address issues other than these typical evangelical hot button issues; they \\"want[ed] to frame political work as an inspirational call to do good‚Äînot just to oppose what they view[ed] as sinful behavior.\\"Stephanie Simon, \\"The Wall Street Journal\\", February 5, 2010 \\"Source 14\\", July 29, 2011 In a 2009 interview with the Washington Post, Daly stated, > I am pro-life, I am pro-traditional marriage.

Switzler (born September 27, 1938 in Boston) is an American politician who served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1973 to 1975 and again from 1977 to 1986. He was a candidate for Governor of Massachusetts in 1986 until he dropped out after inaccuracies about his military record were revealed. Massachusetts House of Representatives A real estate broker and a Wellesley, Massachusetts Town Meeting Member, Switzler was first elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1972. In 1974, redistricting forced Switzler to face fellow Republican representative Bruce H. Zeiser in the newly created 15th Norfolk District. Zeiser defeated Switzler 1,939 votes to 1,803. Zeiser did not run for re- election in 1976 and Switzler ran to succeed him. He defeated Edwina Giles in the Republican primary and David J. Daly in the general election. During his tenure as State Representative, Switzler was described as an \\"outspoken\\" and \\"vociferous\\" critic of the House leadership and as \\"an unsufferable [sic] windbag\\" who continuously used dilatory motions and tactics to delay the legislative process. Switzler co-wrote the property tax law known as Proposition 2¬Ω, which was passed by ballot initiative in 1980. In 1985 he sponsored a successful bill that prevented the Department of Social Services from placing foster children with homosexual couples. 1986 gubernatorial election At the 1986 Massachusetts Republican Convention, Switzler was drafted by Republicans who opposed the nomination of Greg Hyatt after an unsuccessful attempt to get former Congressman Paul W. Cronin to enter the race. After Switzler's strong showing on the first ballot (891 votes for Hyatt, 775 votes for Switzler, 258 votes for Guy Carbone), some of Hyatt's major supporters, including Ray Shamie and Papa Gino's founder Michael Valerio, announced that they would not oppose Switzler's nomination. On the second ballot, Switzler won the nomination with 975 votes to Hyatt's 876 and Carbone's 60. After winning the nomination, Switzler resigned his House seat to focus on his campaign full-time. In June, Switzler dropped out of the race after inaccuracies about his military record were revealed. He had falsely claimed to be a member of the United States Army Special Forces and stated that he had fought in Vietnam when he had only visited Vietnam on leave from noncombat duty in Korea. Later life From 1991 to 2000, Switzler was a member of the Wellesley Board of Selectmen. In 2010, Switzler ran as a write- in candidate for his old House seat. He gained enough signatures to win the Republican nomination, but lost in the general election to incumbent Alice Peisch.

Sponges are marine invertebrates with a jellylike mesohyl sandwiched between two layers of cells. They are filter feeders maintaining a flow of water through their structure which passes out through large openings called oscula. They have a fragile skeleton composed of stiff spicules. Amphiblastula is the larva of scypha. Description This small purse sponge grows singly or in small groups from a single holdfast. It is up to five centimetres long, fairly stiff, greyish-white and spindle-shaped. The osculum at the tip is fringed with fine spicules.Barrett, J. & C. M. Yonge (1958) Collins Pocket Guide to the Sea Shore. Collins, London p41. The surface of the sponge appears furry from its covering of fine papillae. The skeleton consists of a tangential layer of triactines and another of tetractines. This species can be distinguished from the rather similar Sycon raphanus by the fact that the choanocyte chambers are not fused but are free from each other.Marine Species Identification Portal Distribution and habitat Sycon ciliatum is common along the coasts of Europe and occurs on the eastern fringes of the Atlantic Ocean from Scandinavia south to Portugal.

The arsenal was declared surplus property in 1901 and in 1904 the land was formally turned over to the Columbia Military Academy. CMA opened for classes on August 28, 1905. The Great Depression was a hard time for all private schools and CMA was no exception. Enrollment dropped to less than two hundred cadets on a regular basis and the academy struggled to stay open. In 1931, however, a new Operating Board led by C.A. Ragsdale and William O. Batts was created and CMA's situation improved under their leadership in the subsequent years. CMA was rated as an Honor School by the Department of the Army in 1935, a distinction it retained until 1975. The JROTC program, added in 1918, and the ROTC program, added in 1947, were inspected annually by active-duty Army officers and active Army officers and NCO's were assigned to the school as instructors. When Colonel M.F. Gilchrist, Jr., a CMA and West Point graduate, was hired to head Columbia Military Academy in June 1962 enrollment was at its highest level with more than five hundred cadets. Col. E. Blythe Hatcher, a long-time instructor at CMA and Dean of Students at Berry College, was hired as President in 1970. Within nine years, however, Columbia Military Academy was unable to continue. Desegregation of public schools in the 1960s caused a sudden rise in the number of private day schools across the South and the increasing unpopularity of the Vietnam War (and the drop in prestige of everything military) worsened the situation for military boarding schools like CMA. In an effort to increase enrollment female day students were added in 1969 but for them participation in the military programs was optional. This introduction of civilian students to CMA furthered the decline of military elements at the school and in 1978 enrollment in the JROTC and ROTC programs dropped below the minimum level. In order to pay its mounting debts, Columbia Military Academy's property was turned over to a local Christian group and CMA was reorganized as Columbia Academy a Christian day school.

The second and principal segment stretched some 500 km, from the environs of S√£o Lu√≠s, Maranh√£o as far as the region of Fortaleza, (Cear√°).

In their hinterlands were other Tupi ethnicities, like the Guaj√°, the Urub√∫ and the Guajajara. In the 17th century, the Trememb√© began to settle in the Jesuit mission of Aracati-mir√≠m, at Aldeia do Cajueiro (now Almofala) by the Acara√∫ River in Cear√°. There was also a (non-Jesuit) mission at Tut√≥ia (in Maranh√£o). When the Portuguese minister, the Marquis of Pombal, issued his 1759 decrees expelling the Jesuits and dismantling their missions, the settled Trememb√© population moved, along with a handful of priests, to Vila Nova do Soure (Caucaia).

Armstrong\\" on Trove. Retrieved 30 July 2011. In this essay, Armstrong outlines a philosophical account of the mind that is compatible with the Materialist scientific view of the mind. He arrives at a theory of Central-State Materialism, a synthesis between Descartes' dualism (the thesis) and Gilbert Ryle's dispositional behaviourism (the antithesis).  Structure and arguments  The essay begins with the simple assertion that \\"men have minds\\", and Armstrong suggests that modern science may be the best tool with which to investigate the nature of the mind. He says that it seems that scientific consensus is converging on an explanation of the mind in \\"purely physico-chemical terms\\". He acknowledges some disagreement on the matter, but says that dissent tends to be on primarily non-scientific grounds. Armstrong writes that the purpose of his essay is to outline a Materialist account of the nature of the mind - one that is compatible with the scientific view of an entirely physico-chemical mind.  The Authority of Science  Armstrong states that science can achieve consensus among experts on controversial matters after prolonged investigation. This, he says, makes science the authority on the nature of the mind and other matters. It is recognized that science can make mistakes, and that some claim that science has a limited sphere of inquiry. He puts forward science as the best hope we have in understanding the mind.  Defining the Mental  Returning to the search for a Materialist account of the mind, Armstrong considers Behaviourism, which holds that the mind \\"is not something behind the behaviour of the body, it [is] simply part of that physical behaviour\\". While Behaviourism fits nicely with a Materialist view of the mind, it has significant flaws - it is possible to feel or think something without acting on this feeling or thought. For instance, one can feel angry but not express anger. Armstrong looks at Gilbert Ryle's refinement of Behaviourism, Dispositional Behaviourism. Armstrong illustrates Ryle's idea with a description of glass - brittleness is the disposition of materials such as glass to shatter under certain circumstances. Whether or not the glass shatters in a particular instance, it has the disposition to do so. In the same way, a mind can have a disposition towards anger, but it may only express this anger under certain circumstances. Armstrong quotes Ryle's The Concept of Mind: While this dispositionalism quite successfully deals with the objection that one can feel or think one thing and do another, it is not enough - \\"it seems obvious as anything is obvious that there is something actually going on in me that constitutes my thought\\". Ryle's Dispositional Behaviourism denies this, and so Armstrong declares it to be \\"unsatisfactory as a theory of mind\\". Though he rejects Behaviourism, Armstrong suggests that it is useful to say that the mind and mental states are \\"logically tied to behaviour\\". He says that \\"thought is not speech under suitable circumstances, rather it is something within the person that, in suitable circumstances, brings about speech.\\" He thinks this view is compatible with a Materialist view of the mind, though it is also compatible with non-Materialist views, such as Descartes'. Armstrong modifies Ryle's Behaviourism by suggesting that the mind's dispositions may be explainable by science in Materialist terms, in the same way that glass's brittleness can be explained in terms of molecular structure. Armstrong offers this view as a true account of the mind. It is more fully developed in Belief, Truth and Knowledge (1973), ch. 2, sect. 2. Armstrong brings together two earlier conclusions: that the mind is \\"that which stands behind and brings about our complex behaviour\\"; and that the Behaviourist's dispositions are \\"states that underlie behaviour and, under certain circumstances, bring about behaviour\\", and reaches \\"a conception of a mental state as a state of the person apt for producing certain ranges of behaviour\\".  The Problem of Consciousness  Armstrong now addresses what he calls 'the problem of consciousness': how can the personal experience of consciousness be explained by his Materialist theory of the mind? Armstrong considers times when the brain goes on 'auto-pilot' - during long drives without breaks, one might suddenly 'come to' and realize that while one has stayed on the road, stopped at red lights and operated the clutch, one was completely unaware of doing so. This shows that it is possible for mental processes to take place without conscious experience. Before considering how this can be the case, Armstrong describes a method by which a psychologist may determine whether an animal can distinguish between two colours by training it to perform a task that requires this perception. The animal's behaviour would indicate its perception of the colours. While a Behaviourist would say that the animal's behaviour was its perception, Armstrong describes the perception as a state of the animal's mind. It is implied that one could test for consciousness using a similar method. Further illustrating his idea, Armstrong gives an analogy in which perception is a key to a door, the door being action. The unlocking of the door, and therefore action, is optional, but one cannot open the door without the key. A blind man, for instance, lacks certain keys. As a result, he cannot operate in an environment in the same way that a sighted man can. Using this conception of perception as a state, Armstrong characterizes consciousness as \\"perception or awareness of the state of our own mind\\", or \\"a self-scanning system in the central nervous system\\". He sees consciousness not as an external construct that interacts with the body and brain, but a self-aware state of the physical brain.

He was the 11th mayor of Yerevan since Armenia gained independence from the Soviet Union.  Head of community and early career  From 2001 to 2003, he worked as a leading specialist for Armenia's State Committee of Real Estate Cadastre in the territorial unit of Nor Nork, and later became the head of the department. In 2003, he was appointed as the Deputy Head of the Ministry of Bioresources Management Agency. In 2005, he was elected at the age of 27 as head of the district of Avan in the city of Yerevan and was re- elected in 2008 for a second term. During Margaryan's two terms in office, the district of Avan was recognized by Armenia as the best district for two years in a row. In 2009, he was elected as a member of Yerevan's City Council and in the same year was elected as Yerevan's first Deputy Mayor.  Mayor of Yerevan  Taron Margaryan has served as the Mayor of Yerevan since 15 November 2011 after being elected by the City Council and succeeded Karen Karapetyan after his resignation. In 2013, he earned a position at the top of the list of candidates for the Republican Party of Armenia's 2013 municipal elections with the leading slogan \\"Better Yerevan.\\" Following the results of the election that took place on 5 May 2013, Armenia's Central Electoral Commission (CEC) announced that the City Council members have been elected from the RA's list of Yerevan's 42 members from the City Council, 17 members from Yerevan's \\"Prosperous Armenia\\" party, and 6 members from the \\"Hello Yerevan\\" party's electoral bloc list. After Nikol Pashinyan became prime minister of Armenia during the velvet revolution in April 2018, city hall was raided and the Yerevan Fund which Margaryan was head of was implicated in large-scale corrupt practices.https://www.azatutyun.am/a/29353401.html Then a video came out highlighting Margaryan's vast and undeclared wealth and businesseshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_IuACM-hEw which received widespread attention and well over a hundred thousand views. Finally, on 9 July 2018, the embattled Margaryan tendered his resignation as mayor of Yerevan.https://www.yerevan.am/en/news/taron-margaryani-owgherdze-erewants- inerin/https://www.azatutyun.am/a/29353401.html  Main activities  After being elected mayor, Taron Margaryan announced his strategy for the balanced development of Yerevan. During his years in office, all administrative regions of schools specializing in sports or the arts were built and reconstructed, libraries were renovated, heating systems in schools and kindergartens were updated, and children who were residents of Yerevan were given the opportunity to attend kindergarten free of charge. Additionally, in 2013 Taron Margaryan launched an initiative at the Yerevan Zoo, which heretofore had not had any work or improvements done since opening. The zoo now spans 7 by 16 hectares and renovations cost approximately 1 million AMD (US$2,100). Furthermore, in cooperation with the private sector, all districts in Yerevan had public parks built or rebuilt. Taron Margaryan's years in office were marked by extensive road construction. Together with the Asian Development Bank, bypassing roads in Yerevan were constructed to ease and reduce city traffic. His leadership was also of use with the construction of a connecting street between Leningradyan street and Admiral Isakov street, as well as the Leningradyan- Kievyan road junction. He was also active in the construction of the connecting road between Ulnetsi street and Rubinyants street. Furthermore, Taron Margaryan's years in office were also marked by a complete modernization and transition to LED lighting systems from the former Soviet-era lighting systems. Since his early years in office, Taron Margaryan spoke about the need for active information technology and the need for the active use of electronic control systems. Furthermore, in March 2016 Margaryan held a conference with the citizens of RA, receiving nearly 100 questions within 24 hours. In 2014, the prestigious Rutgers University of Public Affairs and Administration E-School Institute located in the United States rated Yerevan as one of the fastest growing cities in the world. The overall index listed Seoul as the leading city of the world, followed by New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Yerevan.  Problems and criticism  Taron Margaryan's leadership is most often criticized due to architectural issues, especially in regards to the demolition of old buildings. Particularly, the central \\"Closed Market\\" or \\"Pak Shuka\\" and the demolition No. 1 Printing building which was brought down by a method of blasting. In the latter case, although the building's privatization and construction permit existed before Taron Margaryan took office, the community nonetheless criticized the municipality for failing to prevent the destruction. Taron Margaryan has also often been criticized by residents for transportation issues, especially in regards to the discussions of raising of transportation fees. Hence, in 2013, plans to raise transportation fees to 150 AMD were suspended after the mayor's orders. Furthermore, since 2013 Taron Margaryan has also been criticized for the problems in the field of waste management in the city of Yerevan; however, the issue currently has been resolved by the implementation of the internationally award-winning Lebanese \\"Sanitek\\" sanitation disposal company, who is now responsible for all garbage disposal in Yerevan. \\"Sanitek\\" has replaced former garbage cans and dumpsters in Yerevan with new bins and collects garbage on a 24-hour set schedule. Moreover, discussions are underway to begin construction of a new landfill for an improved method of waste management. Numerous protests took place during Taron Margaryan's first few years in office on behalf of residents living in buildings considered to be dangerous of the 4th- category. They voiced their concerns in front of City Hall. In December 2015, Taron Margaryan handed out keys to new apartments to residents living in the dormitories located on Sisakyan 3, 4, and 127/1, Nor Aresh 35, Artsakh Street 10/2. The latter was the last phase of the resettlement program for families living in category-4 dangerous buildings. As a result of the resettlement program, a total of 650 families were relocated to new apartments. Residents of damaged houses were resettled in the following addresses: 4 Northern 4th Lane No. 15, Bryussov St. 66th home, 4th Lane of Artsakh, and apartments located on 10/5 and 10/2. Taron Margaryan was also criticized by the press for not having served in the army. However, Markaryan's mandatory military service was dismissed due to the fact that he already had 3 children upon graduating university. Taron Margaryan also initiated programs meant to strengthen army- society ties. Since the past few years, permission has been granted for parents in Yerevan to visit their children serving in the army twice a year. Such programs also aid in providing housing for the families of killed soldiers and freedom fighters. During Taron Margaryan's years in office, he intensified Yerevan's international relations with other neighboring and capital cities, organizing mutual visits regularly. Moreover, Yerevan has 24 sister cities. Sister cities are included in the scope of cooperation in trade, science, technology, culture, health, tourism, construction, and other industries.

Kelly was known as a double-talk artist, and went on to stooge for other comedians such as Willie Howard and Ernie Kovacs. Near the end of his life, he made occasional appearances on The Soupy Sales Show when it was based in New York. Biography Born in Kreva, Russia, Kelly started in an act called Nine Crazy Kids, then started performing comic monologues. Early in his career, he performed largely in the Borscht Belt. When he was performing this stand-up comedy in the 1930s, he fluffed a joke so that it came out as nonsense: this got a good laugh so he made such double- talk the focus of his act and became especially known for this. On television , Kelly was featured on Milton Berle's Texaco Star Theater, The Ed Sullivan Show, The Steve Allen Show, The Ernie Kovacs Show, The Jackie Gleason Show, The Dinah Shore Chevy Show, The Eddie Fisher Show, The Jack Paar Program, Candid Camera, The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson and the game show Back That Fact (1953). He was also an actor with supporting roles, such as in the film Singing in the Dark (1956) and in the TV series Mack & Myer for Hire (1963).

Description Life restoration of an adult Foraminacephale, as a pachycephalosaurid, was a small, bipedal herbivore with a thickened dome on its skull. In 2016, Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at , its weight at . In Foraminacephale, the top surface of the dome is punctuated by many small pits, the eponymous foramina; the dome itself consists of a large, central lobe with a sloped frontal half, and two smaller lateral lobes at the front. The squamosal bone forms a tall bar of completely smooth bone underneath the dome, save for six bony nodes that line the bottom edge of the dome and an additional \\"corner\\" node just below. These features differentiate Foraminacephale from all other pachycephalosaurids. Unlike Stegoceras, Hanssuesia, and Colepiocephale, the parietal bone of Foraminacephale (which constitutes the back part of the dome) projects backwards and downwards over the base of the skull. Two traits also differentiate Foraminacephale from Sphaerotholus and Prenocephale: there are prominent grooves between the central lobe and the lateral lobes, and the opening of the temporal bone is slit-like. Ontogeny As with Stegoceras, the wide age range present in specimens of Foraminacephale allows for analysis of the ontogeny, or growth, of the dome. Measurements of 27 different points on 21 Foraminacephale skulls showed that the dome became proportionally taller with age, but did not become significantly wider. Histology of the specimens showed that the domes became less porous with age - the smallest specimen's skull was 1.67% empty space, while the largest specimen's skull was 0.25% empty space. Generally, the frontal part of the dome was more porous than the parietal part. The growth series of the dome allows Foraminacephale to be differentiated further from Stegoceras. In young Stegoceras, the dome is flat; however, in even the smallest Foraminacephale specimens, the parietal is already slightly domed. The supratemporal fenestrae on the top of the skulls of Foraminacephale are slit-like, as opposed to Stegoceras where they are round, and they seal shut very early in ontogeny as opposed to remaining open more-or-less throughout the animal's lifespan. The amount of empty space in the skull roof was also smaller relative to Stegoceras, and more similar to Acrotholus. Furthermore, in Foraminacephale, the squamosal and postorbital bones became part of the dome much quicker, the dome thickened at a slower rate, and the sides of the dome were less angled than in Stegoceras. Discovery and naming The holotype of Foraminacephale is CMN 1423, a nearly complete frontoparietal dome collected in Dinosaur Provincial Park, Alberta. The layers of rock where the specimen were found belong to the Dinosaur Park Formation of the Belly River Group. Various other fragments of the skull are also known from the Dinosaur Park Formation, representing juvenile, subadult, and adult individuals. Although it has been reported that many specimens are known from the contemporary Oldman Formation, only one (catalogued as TMP 2015.044.0041) can definitely be assigned to Foraminacephale. Another specimen from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation formerly assigned to Foraminacephale, CMN 11316, was re- identified as a small, juvenile indeterminate pachycephalosaurine. CMN 1423 was first assigned to a new species of Stegoceras by Lawrence Lambe in 1918; there was considerable debate over whether \\"S.\\" brevis represented a truly distinct animal or simply a morph, perhaps the female, of S. validum. Later, it was assigned to Prenocephale by Robert M. Sullivan. In 2011, Ryan Schott suggested a new generic name, Foraminacephale, in his Master of Science thesis, resulting in a new combination Foraminacephale brevis. It remained an invalid nomen ex dissertatione until Schott and David Evans formally renamed \\"S.\\" brevis to Foraminacephale brevis in 2016. The generic name combines Latin foramina (\\"foramina\\") with cephale, Latinised Greek for \\"head\\", referring to the many pits that covered the top of its dome. Classification A phylogenetic analysis in 2016 found that Foraminacephale was a member of the Pachycephalosaurinae, in a more derived position than Stegoceras, but in a more basal position than Prenocephale. The consensus of the phylogenetic trees recovered is shown below. The topology of this phylogenetic tree is not very stable, likely due to the incompleteness of most pachycephalosaur specimens. Paleoecology The Belly River Group is particularly rich in pachycephalosaur remains; 70% of all known pachycephalosaur fossils come from this region. Because of a lack of understanding of pachycephalosaur ontogeny, various authors have assigned this material to anywhere from a single species, Stegoceras validum, to four different genera. This has significant implications for the Late Cretaceous biodiversity of herbivorous dinosaurs. The 2016 description of Foraminacephale recognized four distinct species of pachycephalosaur from the Belly River Group: Stegoceras, Foraminacephale, Hanssuesia, and Colepiocephale, although the specimens that have been referred to Hanssuesia likely represent more than one of the existing species.

He is a right-arm fast- medium bowler and a right-hand batsman. In November 2010, Herrick made his First-class cricket debut for Wellington in a New Zealand domestic match and then the following month played for Victoria in a match against England. He impressed, making 40 runs from just 19 balls in the second innings and by taking the wickets of Eoin Morgan and Paul Collingwood. Herrick made a remarkable Sheffield Shield debut for Victoria in March 2011. Playing against South Australia, he claimed match bowling figures of 6/115 from 36 overs. Batting at number 11, he was also part of a crucial 85-run partnership with Steve Gilmour. In that partnership, Herrick contributed 43 from 55 balls. He signed with the Melbourne Renegades in the newly formed Big Bash League for the 2011‚Äì12 season.

Collingwood went on to win the premiership in 1953, but Coghlan was at Hawthorn, having applied for and been granted a clearance to the Hawks. Coghlan was the leading goal-kicker for Hawthorn in three successive seasons from 1953 to 1955. His tally of 19 goals in 1953 remains the lowest ever total to top the Hawthorn goal-kicking. After retiring, Coghlan worked as a football journalist.

The game consists of a blue circular playing field with two clown puppets (one with yellow sleeves, one with green sleeves). The playing field has 25 marbles; ten yellow, ten green, five red. The object of the game is to first \\"eat\\" (by using the handles at the back of the clown puppet's arms to grab the marble using the clown's hands and putting it in its mouth) all ten of the marbles that match the color of that player's clown sleeves (thus the clown with green sleeves eats the green marbles and the yellow marbles are eaten by the yellow- sleeved clown). If a player eats an opposing player's marble (for example if the green sleeved clown eats a yellow marble), it counts the same as if the opposing player ate it. Once the player has \\"eaten\\" all ten of their color marbles, they may now go for the red marbles. The first player to eat three (out of five) wins the game. If a player eats a red marble without first eating their ten yellow/green marbles, the opposing player automatically wins.

It is an inter-state barrage on the Tungabhadra river to supply water to Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states. The full reservoir level of this project is 332.32 m MSL. History RDS was taken up on river Tungabhadra and the head works and the left bank canal was mostly completed by 1956. In the year 2013, Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-2 allocated four (4) tmcft water for construction of RDS right bank canal in Kurnool district. The Project RDS left canal provides irrigation water in Raichur district and Mahbubnagar district of Telangana. The Bachawat Tribunal had allocated 17.1 tmcft to its left canal of which 15.9 tm cft was exclusively meant for Mahabubnagar district. The RDS left canal has been a source of sorrow to the Mahabubnagar farmers because it is hardly giving them 8 to 10 tmcft against their entitlement of 15.9 tmcft. The Rajolibanda project is not receiving adequate continuous flows due to excessive water utilization in its catchment area in Karnataka. It would be a permanent solution to connect the upstream catchment area (near at 475 m MSL) via 20 km long tunnel with the Narayanpur reservoir which is located across the adjacent Krishna River. It would also provide additional water to bring more area under irrigation in uplands of Raichur & Mahboobnagar districts and low lands of Kurnool district. Reliable Krishna river water can be supplied instead of unreliable Tungabhadra river water to the existing Tungabhadra Left bank canal in Raichur district, the existing Rajolibanda left bank canal and the existing 150 years old K. C. Canal. In addition to taking up Rajolibanda right bank canal construction, a new canal /weir ( ) would be constructed across the Tungabhadra river located upstream of Rajolibanda Project to divert the augmented Krishna river water for the additional irrigation in Kurnool district. Thus substantial Tungabhadra reservoir water would be saved for utilization in upstream new projects and reliable water supply is ensured to existing projects.
