The term derives from the Greek words œÉœáŒØœÉŒºŒ± skhisma \\"cleft\\" (borrowed into English as schism, \\"division into opposing factions\\"), and Œ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒµœÉŒπœÇ genesis \\"generation, creation\\" (deriving in turn from gignesthai \\"be born or produced, creation, a coming into being\\"). Concepts =In anthropology= The concept of schismogenesis was developed by the anthropologist Gregory Bateson in the 1930s, to account for certain forms of social behavior between groups among the Iatmul people of the Sepik River. Bateson first published the concept in 1935,Bateson, Gregory (1935) Culture Contact and Schismogenesis, Man, Vol. 35 (Dec) pp.178-183Bateson, Gregory (1972) Steps to an Ecology of Mind, Chandler Publishing Company but elaborated on schismogenesis in his classic 1936 ethnography Naven: A Survey of the Problems suggested by a Composite Picture of the Culture of a New Guinea Tribe drawn from Three Points of View, reissued with a new Epilogue in 1958.Bateson, Gregory. 1936. Naven: A Survey of the Problems Suggested by a Composite Picture of the Culture of a New Guinea Tribe Drawn from Three Points of View. Cambridge; Cambridge University Press; Second Edition, with a Revised Epilogue, 1958, Stanford: Stanford University Press. The word \\"naven\\" refers to an honorific ceremony among the Iatmul (still practiced) whereby certain categories of kin celebrate first-time cultural achievements. In a schematic summary, Bateson focused on how groups of women and groups of men (especially the honorees mothers' brothers) seemingly inverted their everyday, gendered-norms for dress, behavior, and emotional expression. For the most part, these groups of people belonged to different patrilineages who not only did not regularly renew their marriage alliances, but also interacted through the mode he called schismogenesis. Men and women, too, interacted in this mode. And thus the naven ritual served to correct schismogenesis, enabling the society to endure.See Eric Kline Silverman, 2001, Masculinity, Motherhood, and Mockery: Psychoanalyzing Culture and the Iatmul Naven Rite in New Guinea. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press. In his 1936 book Naven, Bateson defined schismogenesis as \\"a process of differentiation in the norms of individual behaviour resulting from cumulative interaction between individuals\\" (p. 175). He continued: :\\"It is at once apparent that many systems of relationship, either between individuals or groups of individuals, contain a tendency towards progressive change. If, for example, one of the patterns of cultural behaviour, considered appropriate in individual A, is culturally labelled as an assertive pattern, while B is expected to reply to this with what is culturally regarded as submission, it is likely that this submission will encourage a further assertion, and that this assertion will demand still further submission. We have thus a potentially progressive state of affairs, and unless other factors are present to restrain the excesses of assertive and submissive behaviour, A must necessarily become more and more assertive, while B will become more and more submissive; and this progressive change will occur whether A and B are separate individuals or members of complementary groups.\\" :\\"Progressive changes of this sort we may describe as complementary schismogenesis. But there is another pattern of relationships between individuals or groups of individuals which equally contains the germs of progressive change. If, for example, we find boasting as the cultural pattern of behaviour in one group, and that the other group replies to this with boasting, a competitive situation may develop in which boasting leads to more boasting, and so on. This type of progressive change we may call symmetrical schismogenesis\\" (pp. 176-77). Somewhat analogous to √âmile Durkheim's concepts of mechanical and organic solidarity (see functionalism), Bateson understood the symmetrical form of schismogenic behavior among Iatmul men to be one of a competitive relationship between categorical equals (e.g., rivalry). Thus one man, or a group of men, boast, and another man/group must offer an equal or better boast, prompting the first group to respond accordingly, and so forth. Complementary schismogenesis among the Iatmul was seen by Bateson between mainly men and women, or between categorical unequals (e.g., dominance and submission). Men would act dominant, leading women to act submissive, to which men responded with more dominance, and so forth. In both types of schismogenesis, the everyday emotional norms or ethos of Iatmul men and women prevented a halt to schismogenesis. The crux of the matter for Bateson was that, left unchecked, either form of schismogensis would cause Iatmul society simply to break apart. Thus some social or cultural mechanism was needed by society to maintain social integration. That mechanism among the Iatmul was the naven rite. Bateson's specific contribution was to suggest that certain concrete ritual behaviors either inhibited or stimulated the schismogenic relationship in its various forms.For a more elaborate discussion of the concept among the Iatmul, see the section \\"Early Work: New Guinea and Bali\\" in Gregory Bateson. =In natural resource management= Bateson's treatment of conflict escalation has been used to explain how conflicts arise over natural resources, including human-predator conflicts in NorwayBrox, Ottar. (2000) \\"Schismogenesis in the Wilderness: The Reintroduction of Predators in Norwegian Forests.\\" Ethnos, Vol. 65 (3) pp.387‚Äì404. doi:10.1080/00141840050198045. and also for conflicts among stakeholder groups in shared fisheries,Harrison, Hannah L., and Philip A. Loring. (2014) ‚ÄúLarger Than Life: The Emergent Nature of Conflict in Alaska‚Äôs Upper Cook Inlet Salmon Fisheries.‚Äù SAGE Open, Vol. 4, pp.1‚Äì14. http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/4/4/2158244014555112 In the latter case, Harrison and Loring compare conflict schismogenesis to the Tragedy of the Commons, arguing that it is a similar kind of escalation of behavior also caused by the failure of social institutions to ensure equity in fisheries management outcomes. =In music= Steven Feld (1994, p. 265-271), apparently in response to R. Murray Schafer's schizophonia and borrowing the term from Bateson, employs schismogenesis to name the recombination and recontextualization of sounds split from their sources. = In modern warfare and politics = There is documented usage of schismogenesis by the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS, an institutional precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)), against Japanese-held territories in the Pacific during World War II. U.S. military academics have identified how China and Russia have pursued social-media strategies of schismogenesis against the U.S. and other Western liberal democracies in an attempt to polarize civil society on both sides of the spectrum to damage policy-making processes and to weaken state/military power. Similarly, scholars in Ukraine have documented how Russia has relied on a strategy of schismogenesis to undermine Ukrainian identity and values as a way of promoting pro-Russian territories that can be used against Kiev, to include forming their own militias which operate alongside Russian special operation forces. = In religion = The concept of schismogenesis has relevance to the numerous schisms which have occurred within religious thought and practice. Types Bateson, in Steps to an Ecology of Mind describes the two forms of schismogenesis and proposes that both forms are self-destructive to the parties involved. He goes on to suggest that researchers look into methods that one or both parties may employ to stop a schismogenesis before it reaches its destructive stage. =Complementary schismogenesis= The first type of schismogenesis is best characterized by a class struggle, but is defined more broadly to include a range of other possible social phenomena. Given two groups of people, the interaction between them is such that a behavior X from one side elicits a behavior Y from the other side, The two behaviors complement one another, exemplified in the dominant-submissive behaviors of a class struggle. Furthermore, the behaviors may exaggerate one another, leading to a severe rift and possible conflict. Conflict can be reduced by narrowing information asymmetries between the two groups. =Symmetrical schismogenesis= The second type of schismogenesis is best shown by an arms race. The behaviors of the parties involved elicit similar or symmetrical behaviors from the other parties. In the case of the United States and the Soviet Union, each party continually sought to amass more nuclear weapons than the other party, a clearly fruitless but seemingly necessary endeavor on both sides. A form of symmetrical schismogenesis exists in common sporting events, such as baseball, where the rules are the same for both teams. Interpersonal communication In the field of communication, complementary schismogenesis is a force that can take effect in a conversation where people have different conversational styles, \\"creating a split in a mutually aggravating way\\".Tannen, Deborah. That's Not What I Meant!, Random House Publishing. The effect causes two well-meaning individuals having a conversation to ramp up different styles, resulting in a disagreement that does not stem from actual difference of opinion. For example, if one person's conversational style favoured louder voices, while the other favoured softer speech, the first person might increase the loudness in their voice while the other spoke softer and softer, each trying to lead the conversation towards their style's conception of normal talking.Feld, Steven (1994) \\"From Schizophonia to Schismogenesis...\\" In Music Grooves, edited by Charles Keil and Steven Feld, 257-289.

They are defined as \\"mutually aggregating spirals which lead people to hold back contributions they could make because others hold back contributions they could make.\\"H√§m√§l√§inen, R.

Saarinen (Eds.), Systems Intelligence in Leadership and Everyday Life: 3-38, Espoo: Helsinki University of Technology, Systems Analysis Laboratory. In Systems intelligence literature, it is held that human interaction has a tendency to fall into such systems unless conscious effort is made to counter this tendency. For example, although most managers would want to give support to their team and most team members would like to receive such support many times support does not result. This is because both parties might feel that the other party is not giving enough and thus they will themselves hold back what they in the best case could give. It has been suggested that systems of holding back are \\"the single most important key to life-decreasing, reciprocity-trivializing and vitality- downgrading mechanisms in human life.\\" Saarinen, E., & H√§m√§l√§inen, R.

Fox and Helen Slater. The screenplay was written by A.J. Carothers, Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr. from a story written by Carothers. Plot Brantley Foster (Michael J. Fox) is a recent graduate of Kansas State University who moves to New York City where he has landed an entry-level job as a financier. Upon arriving, he discovers that the company for which he is supposed to work has been taken over by a rival corporation. As a result, Brantley is laid off before he even starts working. After several unsuccessful attempts to get another job, mostly because he is either overqualified or underqualified and has little experience, Brantley ends up working in the mailroom of the Pemrose Corporation, which is directed by a distant relative though he identifies him as his uncle, Howard Prescott (Richard Jordan), the CEO. Pemrose was founded by Howard's father-in-law; Howard received presidency of the company by marrying his boss's daughter, Vera Pemrose (Margaret Whitton). Upon inspecting company reports, Brantley realizes that Howard and most of his fellow \\"suits\\" (executives) are making ineffective or detrimental decisions. After Brantley notices an empty office in the building due to one of Howard's frequent firings, he uses his access to the mailroom and his understanding of company processes to create the identity of Carlton Whitfield, a new executive. Brantley then assumes this role. While handling two jobs (switching between casual wear and business suits in the elevator), Brantley also falls head-over-heels for Christy Wills (Helen Slater), a fellow financial wizard who recently graduated from Harvard. Brantley meets Vera after driving her home in a company limo (at his employer's request), and she seduces him after persuading him to stay for a swim. Upon seeing Howard arriving, Brantley and Vera realize they are related (albeit not by blood). Vera only seduced Brantley to get back at her husband for having an affair with a woman in his office. Brantley then gets changed as fast as he can and leaves the mansion without being seen by Howard. Howard, unbeknownst to Brantley, is having an affair with Christy. When Howard asks her to spy on Carlton Whitfield, Christy falls head-over-heels for \\"Whitfield\\", not knowing he is actually Brantley. The Pemrose Corporation is preparing for an impending takeover by the Davenport Corporation. If Davenport Corporation absorbs Pemrose, everyone gets fired. Howard, unaware that Whitfield and Brantley are one and the same person, suspects \\"Whitfield\\" is a spy for corporate raider Donald Davenport (Fred Gwynne). Brantley's double identity is discovered when he, Christy, Vera and Howard end up in the same bedroom after a party at Howard‚Äôs home that all four are attending. Brantley and Christy end their budding relationship and Brantley gets sacked from his job he did as Whitfield, as does Christy for refusing to continue the affair with Howard. Vera and Howard are getting divorced, since she found out that Howard was having an affair with Christy and was planning on proposing to her. While both Christy and Brantley are moving out of their offices, they end up in the same elevator and make up, conceiving a revenge plan with Vera. In the end, they raise enough cash, bonds, and stocks to wrest ownership of the Pemrose Corporation from Howard, and to proceed with a hostile takeover bid of Davenport's Corporation. Vera, already contemptuous of Howard for his counter- productive business practices, which were driving her father's empire into the ground, tells the board about his affair as well. She promptly replaces him with Brantley, with Jean (Carlton‚Äôs secretary), Christy and Melrose (Brantley‚Äôs mailroom colleague) at his side. While security guards escort Howard and his aide, Art Thomas (Gerry Bamman), from the Pemrose Building, Brantley and Christy start planning their future together, personal as well as professional. All of them made it to the big time with a penthouse and a limo to take them to the opera. Brantley and Christy decided to visit his parents with a corporate jet. Cast * Michael J.

He was the co-anchor of CBC News: Vancouver on CBUT-DT with Gloria Macarenko, and the 10 PM newscast on CHEK-DT. Parsons' father was a flight-lieutenant in the Royal Air Force. His mother was of Italian descent. His family immigrated to Canada from England in 1948, settling in Feversham, Ontario. After a year studying radio and television arts at the Ryerson Institute in Toronto, he looked for work at Ontario radio stations and eventually shortened his name from Parsonage to Tony Parsons. His first broadcasting job was as a country and western DJ at CJCS in Stratford, Ontario. He worked at various radio jobs in Stratford, Guelph, and Hamilton, before landing in Toronto. After a brief stint with CHUM radio, he took his first television job as a reporter at CFTO-TV, a CTV affiliate. Parsons advanced to become the late evening anchor at CFTO until 1975, when he accepted the opportunity to fill the 6:00 anchor spot on CHAN-TV (better known as BCTV) in Vancouver, British Columbia, where he remained for more than 30 years. He was also the anchor of the national edition of Canada Tonight, a CHAN-produced newscast which aired outside of BC on stations owned by Western International Communications until that company was acquired by the Global Television Network.

However, when the weekly music magazine New Musical Express (NME) advertised for new writers in the summer of 1976, Parsons submitted his novel to the editor, Nick Logan, and was rewarded with a staff writer job. For the next three years he wrote about new music. He wrote the first cover story on the Clash, and features on the Sex Pistols, Blondie, Talking Heads, the Ramones, David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen, the New York Dolls, Buzzcocks, and Led Zeppelin among others. For most of the 1980s, Parsons struggled to make a living as a freelance writer. His career started to recover in 1990 when he wrote Bare, an authorised biography of pop star George Michael. Despite the absence of a written contract with the singer, proceeds from the book were split equally between the two men. However, they fell out in 1999 after an interview Michael had given to Parsons was published in the Daily Mirror. In the 1990s, Parsons became a regular on the live BBC panel show Late Review. He also made a series of authored documentaries for Channel 4. When Piers Morgan became editor of the Daily Mirror, Parsons was poached from The Daily Telegraph as a columnist. In 1993, he presented a film for the British television documentary series Without Walls, focusing on the controversy surrounding the film A Clockwork Orange (1971). Director Stanley Kubrick and distributor Warner Brothers unsuccessfully sued broadcaster Channel 4 in an attempt to prevent clips from the film being shown on television. In the programme Parsons is seen taking a cross-channel ferry from England to France to watch the film, which at the time was embargoed in Britain due to a self-imposed ban by the director. Though it sold respectably on publication, the novel Man and Boy (1999) was a word-of-mouth success, and only reached number one in The Sunday Times bestseller list one year after publication. Despite being succeeded by novels, Man and Boy remains his best-selling book, being published in 39 languages, including Chinese for its publication in the People's Republic of China (January 2009). Man and Boy won the British Book Awards' Book of the Year Prize in 2001. In 2007, Parsons wrote a series of articles about the disappearance of Madeleine McCann from a beach in the Algarve in Portugal, in the Daily Mail. The tone with which these articles were written was later described as having a \\"touch of arrogant xenophobia\\" by The Guardians Marcel Berlins. The Press Complaints Commission that year received 485 complaints, a huge increase in the number of complaints in comparison to previous years, his article on the McCann affair receiving the most complaints. In an article for the Daily Mirror in 2007, entitled \\"Oh Up Yours Senor\\", he said of Portugal's ambassador to Britain, Senhor Ant√≥nio Santana Carlos, \\"And I would respectfully suggest that in future, if you can't say something constructive about the disappearance of little Madeleine, then you just keep your stupid, sardine-munching mouth shut\\". In 2009, Parsons signed a three-book contract with HarperCollins for two further novels and a non-fiction book titled Fear of Fake Breasts. He also writes a monthly column for GQ magazine and, until August 2013, a weekly column for the Daily Mirror. Parsons has expressed in articles a strong loathing for tattoos. In the 1990s he wrote a story titled \\"The Tattooed Jungle\\", suggesting that tattoos were symptomatic of the decline of the working class. In a 2012 article for GQ magazine, he lamented the fact that in the last 20 years in Britain, tattoos have become mainstream, common among both sexes and to all economic classes; he wrote that tattoos \\"remain ugly, hideous daubings that make my flesh crawl with revulsion every time I see one\\". The end of his association with the Daily Mirror came at the beginning of September 2013, with Parsons reportedly leaving the title after 18 years because of a cut in its editorial budget.Mark Sweeney \\"Tony Parsons leaves the Daily Mirror\\", The Guardian, 2 September 2013 Less than two weeks later it was announced that he had joined The Sun on Sunday; Parsons said his previous paper was \\"dying\\" because it was giving away its content for free online.Gavriel Hollander \\"Mirror is 'dying' says former columnist Tony Parsons following move to The Sun on Sunday\\", Press Gazette, 13 September 2013 He has been a supporter of the Conservative Party since 2015. Personal life Parsons married fellow NME journalist Julie Burchill. They had both answered the same advert in the paper requesting \\"hip, young gunslingers\\" to apply as new writers. He and Burchill collaborated on the book The Boy Looked at Johnny published in 1979. After the collapse of their marriage in 1984, periodic clashes in the media between Burchill and Parsons erupted for many years. Parsons became a single parent caring for their four-year-old son, Robert Kennedy Parsons. The experience of being a young man caring for a small child influenced his best-selling novel Man and Boy. Parsons' father died of cancer in 1987, and his mother died of cancer in 1999, just weeks before the publication of Man and Boy. The book is dedicated to Parsons' mother. In 1992, Parsons married Yuriko, a Japanese translator. They have one daughter, Jasmine. He lives with his wife and daughter in London.

It was a powerful Cape Verde hurricane that formed during the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season, originating from a tropical wave on September 16 in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. After remaining a weak tropical cyclone for several days, Gloria intensified into a hurricane on September 22 north of the Lesser Antilles. During that time, the storm had moved generally westward, although it turned to the northwest due to a weakening of the ridge. Gloria quickly intensified on September 24, and the next day reached peak winds of 145 mph (230 km/h). The hurricane weakened before striking the Outer Banks of North Carolina on September 27\\\\. Later that day, Gloria made two subsequent landfalls on Long Island and across the coastline of western Connecticut, before becoming extratropical on September 28 over New England. The remnants moved through Atlantic Canada, eventually dissipating on October 2\\\\. Before Gloria made landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued hurricane warnings at some point for the East Coast of the United States from South Carolina to Maine. Hundreds of thousands of people evacuated, and the hurricane was described as the \\"storm of the century.\\" In general, Gloria's strongest winds remained east of the center, which largely spared locations from North Carolina to New Jersey, and the passage at low tide reduced storm surge. Hurricane-force winds and gusts affected much of the path, which knocked down trees and power lines. This left over 4 million people without power, including the worst power outage in Connecticut history related to a natural disaster. The extended power outage on Long Island, affecting 1.5 million people at some point, caused the Long Island Lighting Company to be shut down and be replaced with a public company. Fallen trees caused six of the storm's fourteen deaths. In North Carolina, high waves damaged many homes along the Outer Banks and caused heavy beach erosion. High waves also damaged piers, boats, and docks throughout the Mid-Atlantic states. Flooding forced several highways to close, and in Pennsylvania, thousands were forced to evacuate their homes. The storm surge destroyed 48 homes on Long Island, while the winds damaged the roofs of many more. Widespread crop damage occurred, amounting to about $20 million (1985 USD). Overall damage in the United States was estimated at $900 million, which was less than expected. In neighboring Canada, the remnants of Gloria caused minor power outages in New Brunswick, although confusion related to the storm's arrival led to the creation of the Canadian Hurricane Centre.  Meteorological history  A tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on September 15\\\\. Based on data from satellite imagery, it is estimated that a tropical depression formed on September 16 near Cape Verde, with an associated low-level circulation. The next day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Gloria, but there was no further intensification. On September 18, Gloria weakened back to tropical depression status, but re-intensified into a tropical storm on September 20\\\\. During this time, it moved generally westward due to a strong ridge to the north. On September 21, the Hurricane Hunters began flying into Gloria to measure the storm's intensity, and the next day, a flight observed winds of at a height of . As a result, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded Gloria to a hurricane about 465 mi (750 km) east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles. After having moved generally to the west, Gloria turned more to the west-northwest on September 22\\\\. This occurred after tropical storms Fabian and Henri weakened the ridge. On September 23, Gloria passed about 155 miles (250 km) to the north of Anegada, the northernmost island in the Lesser Antilles. It initially remained a minimal hurricane until September 24 when it began quickly intensifying. That day, it became a major hurricane while passing northeast of the Bahamas. Gloria developed a wide eye, surrounded by an eyewall, and was producing the stadium effect. At 0120 UTC on September 25, Hurricane Hunters extrapolated a barometric pressure of , and reported flight- level winds of 145 mph (230 km/h). At the time, this was the lowest pressure measured by reconnaissance aircraft over the northern Atlantic Ocean. Because there was little difference in the flight-level winds and the surface winds, this was estimated to have been Gloria's peak intensity, making it a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. However, a preliminary reanalysis released in 2008 suggested peak winds of . At peak intensity, the hurricane was located about 930 mi (1500 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina, and had an eye diameter of only . Hurricane Gloria to the east of Florida on September 25. After peak intensity, Gloria weakened while turning to the north, moving around the western end of the ridge, toward a cold front. By September 26, the winds had decreased to 90 mph (150 km/h), just 30 hours after its peak intensity. Later that day, a buoy about 60 mi (100 km) east of the center recorded a wave height of 46.9 ft (14.3 m), which at the time was the highest buoy wave recording in an Atlantic hurricane. While accelerating toward North Carolina, Gloria re-intensified slightly to winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), making it a Category 2 hurricane. At 0530 UTC on September 27, the hurricane struck southern Hatteras Island in the Outer Banks. After weakening further, Gloria passed just east of the Delmarva Peninsula and New Jersey and interacted with a cold front. Its strongest winds remained on the eastern edge of the circulation, and the storm was gradually losing tropical characteristics. At 1600 UTC on September 27, the hurricane made landfall with a broad and poorly defined center between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Islip, New York, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) on western Long Island. This was only about three days after Henri struck the same general area as a much weaker tropical storm. About an hour after striking Long Island, Gloria made its final landfall in western Connecticut near Westport, and proceeded to move through New England while weakening. The NHC estimated that Gloria became extratropical over Maine early by 0000 UTC on September 28. The storm continued to the northeast through Atlantic Canada passing south of Greenland on September 30\\\\. The extratropical circulation of Gloria was last noted on October 2, although the remnants later affected Europe.  Preparations  Flooding from Hurricane Gloria in Cape May Point, New Jersey Early in Gloria's duration, it threatened the northern Lesser Antilles, prompting a hurricane watch and later warning for the area. Gloria also threatened the Bahamas, prompting that government to issue hurricane watches and warnings. While Gloria was off the east coast of Florida, the NHC issued a hurricane watch from Edisto Beach, South Carolina to Cape Henry, Virginia, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 1000 UTC on September 26, or 19.5 hours before landfall. By later that day, a hurricane watch was issued for the rest of the eastern United States to Eastport, Maine. By two hours before Gloria's landfall on Long Island, a hurricane warning was in effect for the same area, after warnings were gradually extended further north. Officials anticipated higher winds and storm surge than what occurred, due to the hurricane weakening as it approached landfall. Officials in Delaware and Maryland declared a state of emergency before the storm struck, and thousands of people from coastal communities evacuated to shelters. Schools closed in Delaware, and non-emergency workers were sent home. Along Long Island in New York, hundreds of thousands of people evacuated their homes, and a state of emergency was declared for several counties. In Connecticut, about 20,000 people evacuated along the coast, and 7,300 evacuated from neighboring Rhode Island. Residents also evacuated portions of Cape Cod. As Gloria approached the East Coast of the United States, National Hurricane Center director Neil Frank called it the \\"Storm of the Century\\", due to its intensity and potential track over the densely populated region of New England. Such a track gathered the attention of many people, and led to the evacuation of 380,000 people along the coast from North Carolina to Connecticut. In Maryland, officials implemented lane reversing to expedite the evacuation process, a policy many other coastal states now use. Officials advised 95,000 citizens along the New Jersey coastline, an area that rarely experiences hurricanes, to evacuate. Cape May County‚Äîthe most vulnerable part of the state and among the most susceptible in the entire country‚Äîwould require 36 hours in 2005 to evacuate the 100,000 citizens and 900,000 tourists that were commonly present during busy summer weekends. Offices and classes of Harvard University closed only for the third time in the 20th century, the previous cases being the New England Hurricane of 1938 and the Blizzard of '78. Although Gloria's winds downed numerous trees and caused tens of thousands in damage in the area, overall effects were much less than expected. At the same time Gloria was making landfall on Long Island, a storm warning was issued for western New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Across Atlantic Canada, the threat of Hurricane Gloria caused many citizens to rely on American media for storm coverage.  Impact  Boardwalk damage in Ocean City, New Jersey Hurricane Gloria was a large hurricane that affected much of the northeastern United States. Gloria brought strong wind gusts, which downed trees and left hundreds of thousands without power. Overall damage was estimated at $900 million, and there were fourteen deaths. Gloria was the first significant hurricane to affect New England since Hurricane Donna in 1960. = Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic = While offshore the eastern United States, the hurricane's strongest winds were on the eastern periphery, which reduced the winds over land. In North Carolina, where Gloria made its first landfall, the strongest winds were at a station near Buxton at the Cape Hatteras National Weather Service office; a gust of 87 mph (140 km/h) was also observed there. At Diamond Shoal Light, located offshore, sustained winds reached , with gusts to . A peak storm surge of 5.9 ft (1.8 m) was estimated at the Neuse River. A minimal surge of around 1.3 ft (0.4 ft) occurred in neighboring South Carolina, where winds were below tropical storm force. The highest rainfall related to Gloria was , recorded in Edenton, North Carolina. High waves and storm surge resulted in heavy coastal flooding and beach erosion along the Outer Banks, and several new inlets were created. Coastal flooding damaged several homes in the Outer Banks. Damage in the state was estimated at $8.1 million, including $2.4 million in crop damage. There was one death in North Carolina when a man was struck by a fallen tree. Throughout much of the Mid-Atlantic, the winds remained generally below hurricane force; however, winds reached 92 mph (147 km/h) along the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in Virginia and gusts to 89 mph (144 km/h) in Ocean City, Maryland. The strongest winds in the region occurred after the center passed the area. Due to Gloria's fast motion, there was minimal coastal flooding because the highest storm surge occurred during low tide, generally less than 4.9 ft (1.5 m). Beach erosion was reported in both Maryland and Delaware. The heaviest rainfall was west of the center. Statewide peaks included at Valley Forge National Historical Park in Pennsylvania, in Holland, Virginia, and in Annapolis, Maryland. Rainfall spread as far inland as West Virginia. High waves washed away of a fishing pier in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The rainfall caused minor flooding, and high tides flooded coastal portions of the Hampton Roads region. There was minor damage to trees, roofs, and signs in southeastern Virginia. The center of Gloria passed about offshore eastern Maryland. In Ocean City, waves of severely damaged the boardwalk, washing sand and debris a block inland. Downed trees left about 150,000 people in Maryland without power. High winds forced the Chesapeake Bay Bridge to close, and there was little damage outside of eastern Maryland. High waves in Delaware eroded beaches, wrecked dunes, and damaged oceanfront buildings and boardwalks. Storm flooding closed several highways, including Delaware Route 1. Damage was heaviest in Sussex County, although the storm damaged corn and soybean crops in northern Delaware. Monetary damage totaled over $500,000 in the state. In neighboring Pennsylvania, wind gusts reached in Allentown, which knocked down many trees and left thousands without power. Heavy rainfall flooded many streams, which closed or damaged several highways, bridges, and rail lines. About 3,000 houses were flooded, forcing thousands to evacuate. While just off the New Jersey coast, Gloria produced strong winds, peaking at 81 mph (130 km/h) in Ocean City, where a gust of 101 mph (162 km/h) was also reported. In the town, an F0 tornado was reported damaging a house. Rainfall in the state reached at the Charlotteburg Reservoir near West Milford. Heavy beach erosion occurred along the coast, and several coastal towns sustained damage to boardwalks. Strong winds downed trees and power lines, which damaged homes and cars. One person was killed in Long Branch after touching a downed power line. Though Gloria moved quickly through the region, it dropped moderate rainfall in locations, including 6.04 inches (153 mm) at Baltimore‚ÄìWashington International Airport. In addition, some unofficial reports in southeastern Virginia indicated amounts of up to 8 inches (200 mm) of rain. Because much of the Mid-Atlantic experienced the western, weaker side of this hurricane, damage was relatively light. High winds downed numerous trees throughout the area, leaving hundreds of thousands without power, including 237,000 in New Jersey, 124,000 in Maryland, and 56,000 in Virginia. Extreme rainfall in Virginia resulted in $5.5 million (1985 USD) in damage. Intense flood waters split Long Beach Island in half for a period of time. = Long Island and New York City = Rainfall totals related to Hurricane Gloria While making its second landfall, Gloria was accompanied by a storm surge of 6.9 ft (2.1 m) at Battery Park, the highest along its path. The highest wind report was a gust of 85 mph (137 km/h) at Islip Airport. Central Park reported a gust of 51 mph (83 km/h). Rainfall in the state reached at Unadilla, although was much less near the coast, reaching 3.48 in (88.4 mm) in Central Park. Along Long Island, the high storm surge flooded hundreds of streets and caused heavy beach erosion. High winds downed thousands of trees and damaged hundreds of homes, causing widespread power outages. About 1.5 million people in the state lost power, including two-thirds of the Long Island Lighting Company customers, making it one of the worst power outages in the state. There were four deaths on Long Island, two of whom related to heart attacks and the other two related to fallen trees. There were also 14 injuries in the region, many of them due to downed tree branches. In the New York mainland, heavy rainfall flooded rivers and alleviated drought conditions. Rough waves damaged boats and docks along the Hudson River. Unsettled weather contributed to a traffic fatality and an airplane crash that killed one in the New York mainland. It is believed peak gusts reached 115 mph (185 km/h) in eastern Long Island. Weather forecasters believe that damage across parts of Long Island indicated winds in the Category Three range, as evidence of the damage received at MacArthur Airport. Gloria's high winds caused significant damage across Long Island and southeastern New York. The area hit the worst was eastern Long Island, where high wind gusts blew thousands of trees into buildings and across roads. The broadcast tower of WBLI-FM toppled on Bald Hill in Farmingville. In addition, the winds ripped roofs off of many buildings, including hangars at the MacArthur Airport, a hangar at the Bayport Aerodrome and the roof of the Islip Police Station. Prolonged exposure to high winds and waves led to moderate beach erosion, washing away several piers and docks. The storm surge, though relatively weak, destroyed 48 houses on the ocean side of the island. Gloria's high winds left 683,000 people in New York without power, with some lacking electricity for over eleven days. = New England and Canada = Satellite image of Hurricane Gloria making landfall on New England While moving across New England, Gloria was a weakened hurricane that passed quickly through the area. Though still a large hurricane, Gloria hit at low tide, resulting in low to moderate storm surges of 5 feet (1.5 m) in Groton, Connecticut, 6 feet (1.8 m) in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and 3 feet (1 m) in Portland, Maine. The high waves caused heavy beach erosion in Connecticut and Rhode Island. The highest sustained winds were reports of 83 mph (135 km/h) in Waterbury, Connecticut, and Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory in Massachusetts, although neither location is at sea level. Gusts peaked at 110 mph (176 km/h) in Chatham, Massachusetts, and widespread areas across New England reported hurricane-force gusts. It is estimated that hurricane-force winds occurred in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Rainfall in the region peaked at at Borden Brook Reservoir in Springfield, Massachusetts. In Connecticut, Gloria crossed from Westport along Long Island Sound, passed near Hartford, and exited into Massachusetts. Wind gusts peaked at in Bridgeport, and also reached in Hartford. The winds downed thousands of trees, many of which knocked down power lines. This left about 727,000 residents without power, setting a record for the state related to a weather event. High waves damaged or sunk hundreds of boats along the coast, and several beachfront homes and docks were damaged. Light rainfall caused some minor flooding, mostly in northwestern Connecticut. Statewide there was about $6 million in crop damage. Damage was heaviest near Hartford, and overall storm damage was estimated at $91 million. Fallen trees contributed to two of the three deaths in the state, as well as several other injuries. Hurricane-force gusts affected Rhode Island, peaking at in Westerly. The winds uprooted thousands of trees and caused widespread roof damage. About 300,000 people statewide lost power, the greatest since the Northeast blackout of 1965. Coastal flooding was minimized due to the storm striking at low tide, although were high enough in Narragansett Bay to damage docks and hundreds of boats. Damage in the state was estimated at $20 million, including the cost for restoring the power outages. There were two deaths in Rhode Island; one was related to a fallen tree, and one occurred when a man was trying to secure his boat. In Massachusetts, the hurricane moved from Connecticut through the Springfield area. There was a small F1 tornado in Middlesex County that damaged trees. High winds knocked over thousands of trees, and about 500,000 people statewide lost power. Heavy rainfall caused stream flooding, although the heaviest damage was from the winds. The hurricane destroyed a radio tower in Framingham and damaged hundreds of homes in the eastern portion of the state. Along the coast, the storm tide caused minor coastal flooding and damaged hundreds of boats. Across Massachusetts, damage was estimated at $61 million, including $6 million from crop damage. By the time Gloria reached New Hampshire, it had weakened and was becoming extratropical, although hurricane- force wind gusts were reported across the state. On the top of Mount Washington, wind gusts reached . The winds were strong enough to knock down large trees, many over 50 years old and . Downed trees cut power lines, which left 97,116 people without power, mostly along the coast. Fallen trees also damaged 16 homes and several vehicles. High rainfall damaged portions of North Woodstock, although water damage was generally minor. There was one death in the state, when an elderly woman was knocked over by the strong winds and died two weeks later. There was about $2.5 million in crop damage, mostly to the apple crop. In neighboring Maine, about 600,000 people lost power due to the storm, the most since the passage of hurricanes Carol and Edna in 1954. Winds in Maine reached , and the storm knocked down about 100 power poles in addition to the downed lines. Downed trees blocked roads and damaged houses and cars. The winds damaged roofs, including the 127‚Äëyear‚Äëold spire of a church in Groveville. Crop damage to the apple crop was estimated at $3 million. High waves along the coast damaged lobster traps and dozens of boats, many of which were driven ashore. Gloria's high winds downed numerous trees across New England, causing minor to moderate damage. In the region, Connecticut received the worst of the hurricane, where tree and structural damage was greatest. Along the coastline, storm surge and strong waves washed away several fishing piers, and some roadways were underwater during the storm's passage. New Hampshire was affected only slightly from the hurricane, and was limited to minor wind damage and localized flooding. In Maine, damage was more severe, where strong wind gusts ripped off roofs and uprooted hundreds of trees. High winds across New England resulted in significant power outages, leaving 250,000 in Maine without power. In all, seven deaths occurred in New England, many of which occurred from falling tree limbs. While the remnants of Gloria were moving through Atlantic Canada, they produced rainfall to the north of the track, reaching as high as 4.53 in (115 mm) in Quebec. The highest winds in the country were 58 mph (93 km/h), peaking in the Bay of Fundy and to the northeast of Newfoundland. The remnants of Gloria caused wind and wave damage in Nova Scotia. Wind gusts of 55 mph (89 km/h) in Fredericton, New Brunswick knocked down power lines, affecting more than 1,800 people.  Aftermath  On Long Island, thousands were left without power for over a week, until the last outages were restored two weeks after the storm on October 8\\\\. The long duration without electricity forced hundreds of schools to close, extended train times by six hours due to lack of powered crossings, and price gouging on food, ice, and generators. The lack of power led to a general disdain for the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO), which increased further when the company left the $40 million (1985 USD) repair bill to the ratepayers, citing the company's lack of hurricane insurance. Citizens quickly protested LILCO's decision, and within years the publicly owned Long Island Power Authority was formed. Residents in both Massachusetts and Connecticut were also without power for up to two weeks. The states brought in workers from other states, although the delay in restoring the widespread outages caused many schools to remain closed. In Connecticut, one man was electrocuted while repairing downed power lines. About 477,000 Connecticut Light & Power customers in the state lost power, a record that was surpassed by the 754,000 who lost power during Hurricane Irene in 2011. Later in 2011, a nor'easter in October left over 830,000 people statewide without power, also breaking the record set by Gloria. In New Hampshire, most power outages were quickly restored, and all were restored within six days. In Maine, all power outages were restored in 11 days. After the storm, President Ronald Reagan declared several counties in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts as federal disaster areas. This declaration allowed those counties to apply for disaster assistance. In Canada, the damage was less than expected, but confusion related to the storm threat prompted Environment Canada to research the need for a dedicated hurricane centre in 1986. The following year, the Canadian Hurricane Centre was established with offices on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Due to its impact, the name Gloria was retired from the Atlantic tropical storm naming list. It will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. It was replaced with Grace in the 1991 season.

Claims for the award of prize money were usually heard in a Prize Court, which had to adjudicate the claim and condemn the prize before any distribution of cash or goods could be made to the captors. Other cases in which prize money has been awarded include prize money for the capture of pirate ships, slave ships after the abolition of the slave trade and ships trading in breach of the Navigation Acts, none of which require a state of war to exist. Similar monetary awards include Military Salvage, the recapture of ships captured by an enemy before an enemy Prize Court has declared them to be valid prizes (after such ships have been condemned, they are treated as enemy ships), and payments termed Gun money, Head Money or Bounty, distributed to men serving in a state warship that captured or destroyed of an armed enemy ship. The amount payable depended at first on the number of guns the enemy carried, but later on the complement of the defeated ship. Certain captures made by armies, called Booty of War, are distinct from naval prize because, unlike awards under naval prize legislation, the award of booty is only made for a specific capture, often the storming of a city; the award does not set a precedent for other military captures in the same war, and does not require adjudication by a prize court. When the British army and navy acted together, it was normal for instructions to say how any prizes and booty should be shared, and the shares allocated. In this case, combined naval and military force to be dealt with under naval prize law rules. Although prize law still exists, the payment of prize money to privateers ceased in practice during the second half of the 19th century and prize money for naval personnel was abolished by those maritime states that had provided it at various times in the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. Origins The two roots of prize law and the consequent distribution of prize money are the mediaeval maritime codes, such as the Consolato Del Mare and Rolls of Oleron, which codified the customary laws that reserved legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea, in harbour or on the shore for the rulers of maritime states, Wright 16 and the 16th and 17th century formulation of international law by jurists such as Hugo Grotius. Wright 23. These jurists considered that only the state could authorise war, and that goods captured from an enemy in war belong as of right to its monarch. However, it was customary for the state to reward those who that assisted in making such captures by granting them part of the proceeds. Wright 21-23 In various 17th century states, the crown retained from one-tenth to one-fifth of the value of ships and cargoes taken by privateers but up to half of the value of those captured by the state‚Äôs navy. Grotius also recorded the practices that, for a prize to be effective, the ship must either be brought to port or retained for 24 hours, and that no distribution of prize money or goods could made without due court authorisation. Wright 22, 24 Most European maritime states, and other maritime states that adopted laws based on European models, had codes of prize law based on the above principles that allowed for monetary rewards for captures. However, details of prize money law and practice are known for relatively few of these. They include English rules from the 17th century, which formed the basis for the rules for Great Britain and the United Kingdom in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, those of France from the 17th to 20th centuries, the Dutch Republic, mainly for the 17th century, and the United States for the 18th and 19th centuries. Wright 27 The smaller navies of maritime states such as Denmark and Sweden, had little chance of gaining prize money because they had few opportunities to capture enemy ships in wartime, both because, after the Great Northern War, they were rarely involved in naval wars and, when they were, their fleets were much weaker than their major opponents. Wilson, Hammar & Seerup 5, 163-164 =Booty of war= Booty of war, also termed spoils of war is the movable property of an enemy state or its subjects which can be used for warlike purposes, in particular its soldiers' arms and equipment, captured on land, as opposed to prize which is hostile property captured at sea. It is legally the property of the victorious state, but all or part of it (or its value) may be granted to the troops that capture it. Phillimore, 214-215 In British practice, although the Crown may grant booty and to specify its distribution, this was done by a special proclamation relating to a specific capture which did not set a precedent, not a general measure dealing with all captures made during a war, as were naval Prize Acts. Van Niekerk, 123 Instances of it being granted include the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799, the capture of Bordeaux, 1814 and the Siege of Delhi, 1857. Phillimore, 214-215. Although the United States and France had allowed their soldiers to profit from booty on a basis similar to Britain, they abolished the practice in 1899 and 1901 respectively. Phillimore, 227-229. The Third Geneva Convention now only allows the arms, military equipment and military documents of prisoners of war to be seized and prohibits the award of booty. England to 1707 The Crown of England had, from medieval times, legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea or found on the shore. These included the rights to shipwrecks, ships found abandoned at the sea, Flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict, enemy ships and goods found in English ports or captured at sea in wartime and goods taken from pirates. At first, these were collectively known as Droits of the Crown, but after the creation the office of the High Admiral, later the Lord High Admiral, of England in the early 15th century, they were known as Droits of Admiralty, as the Crown granted these rights, and legal jurisdiction the property specified in them, to the Lord Admiral. This jurisdiction ceased in 1702, but the name Droits of Admiralty remained in use. Holdsworth 559-560 Early Prize Law made little distinction between financial rewards made to officers and men of the Royal Navy and to privateers (civilians authorised to attack enemy shipping by Letters of marque issued by the Crown), as the former did not exist as a permanent force until the 16th century. Mediaeval rulers had no administrative mechanism to adjudicate prizes or collect the royal share. Wright 31-33 The first Admiralty Court in England with responsibility for prize and prize money issues was created in 1483 and subordinate Vice- Admiralty courts were later set up in British colonies. Appeal from the Court of Admiralty was to the Privy Council. As the rights over enemy ships or goods are legally prerogatives of the Crown, there are few English or British statues that deal with naval prize money, other than the Prize Acts issued at the start of each war, authorising the Crown to issue orders or proclamations dealing with prize money, and these acts affirm rather than limit the Crown‚Äôs rights. Marsden (1915) 91-92 From Elizabethan times, the Crown insisted that the validity of prizes and their value had to be determined by royal courts, and that it should retain a portion of their value. In some cases, an English ship failing to bring a prize for adjudication was confiscated. Beyond this, it was left to the discretion of the Crown, guided by custom, as to what should be allocated to those taking prizes, and how that prize money should be allocated between the owners, the officers and the crew. Wright 45-46. Generally, the Crown retained one-tenth of the value of prizes captured by privateers. By ancient custom, the common seamen, but not the officers, of navy vessels had the right of ‚Äò‚Äôfree pillage‚Äô‚Äô, the seizure of the enemy crew‚Äôs personal possessions and any goods not stored in the hold. Marsden (1909) 695, 697 The Commonwealth attempted to forbid the custom of pillage in 1652, but this rule was impossible to enforce, and the right to pillage was given statutory force after The Restoration. Wright 51 Some rewards that were previously customary or discretionary for privateers became entitlements 1643, when an ordinance passed by the Commonwealth parliament allowed them to retain any ships and goods captured after adjudication in an Admiralty Court and payment of one-tenth of the value of the prize and customs duties on any goods. A further ordinance of 1649 relating to naval ships, which applied during the First Anglo-Dutch War, entitled seamen and subordinate officers to half the value of a captured enemy warship and Gun money of between 10 and 20 pounds for every gun on an enemy warship that was sunk, and one third of the value of a captured enemy merchant ship. If a captured enemy warship were repairable at reasonable cost and suitable to add to the English fleet, the Crown might but bought it. Marsden (1911) 37 However, until 1708, the purchase price was fixed by the Admiralty, whose agents were suspected of valuing them cheaply or inflating the cost of repairs. Bromley 451 The 1643 ordinance also introduced two new measures: that part of the money not allocated to the ship‚Äôs crew would go to the sick and wounded, and that English ships recaptured from an enemy were to be returned to their owner on payment of one- eighth of their value to the ship recapturing them. A further ordinance of 1650 applied these prize money rules to the capture of pirate ships. Wright 50-51 The provisions of 1643, 1649 and 1650 on the distribution of prize money were repeated after The Restoration in an act of 1661, which also expressly allowed the custom of pillage, and allowed the Lord Admiral discretion over any money or goods not allocated to the crews. The right of disposing of captured prizes and pre-emption in acquiring their goods was also retained by the Lord Admiral. Marsden (1911) 43-44 =Anglo-Dutch Wars= Even before the Second Anglo-Dutch War formally began, two steps were taken by the English government that were liable to promote hostility between England and the Netherlands. Firstly, in 1663, the Navigation Act, which aimed to restrict Dutch maritime trade, authorised the capture of English or foreign vessels trading in breach of that act as prizes, and allowed Vice-Admiralty Courts in the English colonies to adjudicate their value, and to award one-third of this value to the captor, one third to the colonial governor and one third to the Crown. These overseas Vice-Admiralty Courts were, from 1692, also able to deal with wartime prizes. Marsden (1911) 43-44 Secondly, an Order in Council of 1644 increased the prize money due to the seamen of English ships that took prizes to 10 shillings for each ton comprised in their tonnage, and gun money of at least 10 pounds a gun for any warship sunk or burned. Fox 74 Although neither Charles II nor his brother James, Lord High Admiral since 1660, had been ungenerous to those Royal Navy captains and flag officers that captured enemy ships, giving them a fair allocation of the value of their prizes, the failure to set out a fixed scale of prize money for senior officers led to a scandal in 1665. Fox 113 The Earl of Sandwich commanded an English fleet that, between 3 September and 9 September, had captured thirteen Dutch East India Company merchant ships of the East Indies spice fleet, and had also captured or sunk several of their escorts. Concerned that Charles‚Äôs difficult financial position might make him less generous that before, and considering the great value of the cargoes captured, Sandwich, urged on by one of his flag officers, Sir William Penn, agreed that he and Penn should take goods to the value of 4,000 pounds, and that each other flag officer and the three captains that held knighthoods should take goods worth 2,000 pounds, from the captured cargoes: nothing was provided for the untitled captains. Fox 113-114 This seizure of goods was represented by Sandwich and Penn as a payment on account of their expected prize money, although it was in clear breach of the instructions issued in 1665 at the outbreak of the war that required ships and goods to be declared as lawful prizes by an Admiralty court before any goods in its hold could be removed. Marsden, (1911), pp. 44-45. Three of those officers offered 2,000 pounds of goods refused to take them, and the untitled captains complained against the arrangement. In the course of the removal of goods from the Dutch ships‚Äô holds, many English sailors joined in the plundering, and a large quantity of spices and other valuable goods were stolen or spoilt. The Earl of Sandwich lost his command, and the government lost goods and money that could have been used to send the fleet back to sea. Fox 115 English privateers were very prominent at sea during the Anglo-Dutch Wars, attacking the maritime trade and fisheries on which the United Provinces depended, capturing many Dutch merchant ships. Fox 69-70 =War of the Spanish Succession= The situation of ships‚Äô captains was remedied by a Prize Act of 1692. This act distinguished between captures made by privateers and by royal ships. Privateers were entitled to retain any ships captured and four- fifths of the goods, surrendering one-fifth of those to the Crown, and it was left to them how they sold their prizes and distributed the proceeds. However, in the case of captures by royal ships, one-third of their value went to the officers and men of the captor, and one third to the king, from which he could reward flag officers. The final one-third was to benefit those sick and wounded, as before, and for the first time was also used to pay dependents of crew members killed and to fund Greenwich Hospital. Wright 53 The 1692 act also abolished the ancient right of pillage, standardised gun money at 10 pounds a gun and provided for salvage to be paid by the owners of English ships recaptured from the enemy. Marsden (1915) 90 Until 1692, the allocation of the one-third of the value of prize money due to the officers and men lad been a matter of custom, but it was then fixed as one-third (or one-ninth of the total prize money) to the captain, one-third to other officers and one- third to the crew. Ehrman 129-130 During this war, in 1701, the Admiralty had established a board of Prize Commissioners, who appointed local prize agents at British and some colonial ports, and were responsible for the custody of ships captured both by privateers and royal ships until these captures were either condemned or released. Although privateers were free to dispose of prize ships and goods after they were condemned and any duties were paid, the Prize Commissioners were responsible for the sale of ships and cargoes captured by royal ships, the valuation of ships or goods acquired for Royal Navy use, and the calculation and payment of prize money. As many naval actions in this war took place in the Mediterranean or Caribbean, some captains disposed of captured ships without bringing them before an Admiralty prize agent, often defrauding their own crews of all or part of their prize money entitlement. A Royal Proclamation of 1702 made captains that failed to act through prize agents liable to court martial and dismissal. Bromley 449-450 If the Admiralty Court found that a seizure was unlawful, the ships and cargo was restored to its owner, and the captor would be responsible for any loss or costs arising. Malcomson, 64-65 Great Britain, 1707 to 1801 After the Act of Union 1707 between England and Scotland, the former English prize money rules applied to Great Britain. The War of the Spanish Succession continued until 1714. An Act of 1708, generally known as the Cruisers and Convoys Act was designed to protect British maritime trade by allocating Royal Navy ships to protect convoys, by encouraging privateers to assist in protecting convoys and amending the prize rules to encourage naval ships to attack enemy warships, and both Royal Navy ships and privateers to attack enemy privateers and merchant ships.The two main changes to the made under this Act were the abolition of the Crown‚Äôs shares in the value of merchant ships and their cargoes captured by naval vessels, and of goods captured by privateers, and the payment of Head money of 5 pounds for each crew member of a captured or sunk enemy warship, as far as these could be established, replacing gun money. As with other Prize Acts, this ceased to have effect at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714, although its provisions were largely repeated in subsequent Prize Acts of 1756, 1776, 1780 and 1793, issued at the outbreaks of conflicts or to include new belligerents. Baugh 113-114 Wright 58 Occasionally, if an enemy merchant ship were captured where it was difficult to take it to an Admiralty Court or prize agent, the captor might offer to ransom it for 10% to 15% of its estimated value. Hill, 99. In 1815, ransoming was prohibited except in case of necessity, for example where an enemy warship were nearby. Malcomson, 68-69 The 1708 Act still required captured ships to be placed in the custody of Admiralty prize agents before adjudication by the Admiralty Court, and of paying Customs duties on captured cargoes. However, once they had paid these duties, Royal Navy captors were free to sell these cargoes at the best prices rather than having to sell them through Admiralty prize agents, as privateers had always been able to do so. The Act also allowed Royal Navy captains, officers and crews to appoint their own experts and prize agents to dispute the value of ships or goods acquired for naval use and collect prize money on their behalf. Rodger (1986) 128‚Äì130 Admiralty appointed prize agents were, however, now entitled to a fee of 2% in Britain and 5% abroad. The various changes brought in by this Act are regarded as the basis for the fortunes made from prize money in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Bromley 451-452. =Distribution= In the Georgian navy, shares of prize money were based on rank. As there were few senior ofÔ¨Åcers, their individual shares were larger than junior officers and very much larger than those of the seamen. The percentages of prize money granted to senior ofÔ¨Åcers were generally higher in the 18th century than in most of the 19th century. Although shares varied over time, and captains within a Ô¨Çeet or squadron could agree alternative sharing arrangements, in the 18th century, an admiral could generally receive one-eighth of the value of all prizes taken by his fleet or squadron, and if there were more than one admiral, they would share that eighth. A captain usually received one-quarter of the value his prize, or three-eighths if not under the command of an admiral. The distribution for other officers and men was less detailed than it later became: other ofÔ¨Åcers shared another quarter and the crew shared the remainder. Any ships within sight of a battle also participated in the sharing of prize money, and any unclaimed prize money was allocated to Greenwich Hospital. Allen, 213 During the Seven Years' War, the crews of privateers operating from the British colonies in America and the Caribbean were often paid wages as well as a share of prize money, but the crews of those operating from British ports usually received no wages and the cost of the provisions they consumed was deducted from their prize money. The owners of privateers generally took half the value of any prize and also charged a further 10% to cover prize agents' fees and other commissions. The captain received 8% of the value by custom, leaving 32% to be shared by the other officers and crew. It was common practice to divide this into shares, with the officers receiving several times as much as seamen, their relative shares being agreed at the start of the voyage. Rodger (1986) 97, 312 =Notable awards, 1707 to 1801= Perhaps the greatest amount of prize money awarded for the capture of a single ship was for that of the Spanish frigate Hermione on 31 May 1762 by the British frigate and sloop . The two captains, Herbert Sawyer and Philemon Pownoll, received about ¬£65,000 apiece, while each seaman and Marine got ¬£482 to 485. The total pool of prize money for this capture was ¬£519,705 after expenses. Rodger (1986) 257 However, the capture of the Hermione did not lead to the largest award of prize money to an individual. As a result of the Siege of Havana, which led to the surrender of that city on August 1762, 10 Spanish ships-of-the-line, three frigates and a number of smaller vessels were captured, together with large quantities of military equipment, cash and merchandise. Prize money payments of ¬£122,697 each were made to the naval commander, Vice-Admiral Sir George Pocock, and the military commander, George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle, with ¬£24,539 paid to Commodore Keppel, the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother. Each of the 42 naval captains present received ¬£1,600 as prize money. Rodger (1986) 257-258 The military second-in-command, Lieutenant-General Eliott, received the same amount as Commodore Keppel, as the two shared a fifteenth part of the prize pool, as against the third shared by their commanders.Pockock p. 216 Privates in the army received just over ¬£4 and ordinary seamen rather less than ¬£4 each. Corbett (1986) 283 The prize money from the capture of the Spanish frigates Thetis and Santa Brigada in October 1799, ¬£652,000, was split up among the crews of four British frigates, with each captain being awarded ¬£40,730 and the Seamen each receiving ¬£182 4s 9¬æd or the equivalent of 10 years' pay. Rodger (2005) 524 United Kingdom from 1801 After the Act of Union 1801 between Great Britain and Ireland, the former prize money rules of Great Britain applied to the United Kingdom. The Treaty of Amiens of March 1802 ended the hostilities of the French Revolutionary Wars and those of the Napoleonic Wars commenced in May 1803, when the United Kingdom declared war in France. Prize Acts at the start of war with France and Spain repeated the provisions of the 1793 Act, which in turn largely repeated those of 1708. Wright 59 The basis of distribution under these acts is detailed in the next section. However, a proclamation of 1812 soon after the start of the War of 1812 made a further revision to the rules on allocation, such that the admiral and captain jointly received one-quarter of the prize money with one-third of this going to the admiral, a reduction from their previous entitlement. The Master and lieutenants received one- eighth of the prize money, as did the warrant officers. The crew below warrant officer rank now shared one-half of the prize money. However, this group was subdivided into several grades, from senior petty officers down to boys, with the higher grades gaining at the expense of the lower ones. Hill, 204-205 The Prize Act of 1815, issued after Napoleon‚Äôs return from Elba, largely repeated the allocation below the flag officers‚Äô share into eight grades and, although it lapsed in the same year, its provisions were re-enacted in 1854 at the start of the Crimean War. Wright 60-61 The multiplicity of prize money grades survived until 1918, with some refinements to include new ratings required for steamships. The Naval Agency and Distribution Act of 1864 was a permanent Act, rather than one enacted at the start of a particular conflict, stating that prize money was to be distributed according to a Royal Proclamation or Order in Council issued when appropriate. Lushington, 106-107 This act made no provision for privateers as the United Kingdom had signed the Declaration of Paris, which outlawed privateering by the ships of signatory nations. Parillo (2007), 62-63 The Royal Proclamation on the division of prize money dated 19 May 1866 provided for a single admiral to receive, or several admiral to share, one-thirtieth of the prize money pool; a single captain or commanding officer to receive, or several share, one-tenth of the pool, and the residue to be allocated to officers and ratings in 10 classes in specified shares. Lushington, 109-111 The Prize Courts Acts of 1894 provided that regulations for setting up of Prize Courts and on prize money should in future be initiated at the start of any war only by an Order in Council and not by Royal Proclamation. The Naval Prize Act 1918 changed the system to one where the prize money was no longer paid to the crews of individual ships, but into a common fund from which a payment was made to all naval personnel. The Act also stated that no distribution until after the end of the war. The award of prize money in the two World Wars were governed by this legislation, which was further modified in 1945 to allow for the distribution to be made to Royal Air Force (RAF) personnel who had been involved in the capture of enemy ships. The Prize Act, 1948 abolished the Crown prerogative of granting prize money or any money arising from Droits of the Crown in wartime. O‚ÄôHare 116-117 For more on the Prize Court during World War I, see also Maxwell Hendry Maxwell-Anderson. =Anti-slavery= After the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807, an additional source of prize money arose when Royal Navy ships of the West Africa Squadron captured slave ships. Under an Order in Council of 1808, the government paid 60 pounds for each male slave freed, 30 pounds for each woman and 10 pounds for each child aged under 14. This was paid in lieu of any prize money for the captured slave ship, which became the property of the British government, and it was allocated in the same proportions as other prize money. Between 1807 and 1811, 1,991 slaves were freed through the Vice-Admiralty Court of Sierra Leone, and between 1807 and mid-1815, HM Treasury paid Royal Navy personnel 191,100 pounds in prize money for slaves freed in West Africa. Condemned slave ships were usually auctioned at Freetown and re-registered as British ships. Allen, 213 Helfman, 1143-1144 However, in 1825, the bounty for all slaves was reduced to a flat rate of 10 pounds, and it was further reduced to 5 pounds for each live slave in 1830. The decline in captures prompted an increase in prize money in 1839 to 5 pounds for each slave landed alive, half that sum for slaves that had died and one pound and ten shillings for each ton of the captured vessel‚Äôs tonnage. Lloyd 79-81. =Distribution= Command structure of a Navy ship c. 1810, showing prize money groupings The following scheme for distribution of prize money was used for much of the Napoleonic wars until 1812, the heyday of prize warfare. Allocation was by eighths. Two eighths of the prize money went to the captain or commander, generally propelling him upwards in political and financial circles. One eighth of the money went to the admiral or commander-in-chief who signed the ship's written orders (unless the orders came directly from the Admiralty in London, in which case this eighth also went to the captain). One eighth was divided among the lieutenants, sailing master, and captain of marines, if any. One eighth was divided among the wardroom warrant officers (surgeon, purser, and chaplain), standing warrant officers (carpenter, boatswain, and gunner), lieutenant of marines, and the master's mates. One eighth was divided among the junior warrant and petty officers, their mates, sergeants of marines, captain's clerk, surgeon's mates, and midshipmen. The final two eighths were divided among the crew, with able and specialist seamen receiving larger shares than ordinary seamen, landsmen, and boys.*Rodger (205) 522‚Äì524 The pool for the seamen was divided into shares, with each able seaman getting two shares in the pool (referred to as a fifth-class share), an ordinary seaman received a share and a half (referred to as a sixth-class share), landsmen received a share each (a seventh-class share), and boys received a half share each (referred to as an eighth-class share). A notable prize award related to a capture in January 1807, when the frigate Caroline took the Spanish ship San Rafael as a prize, netting Captain Peter Rainier ¬£52,000. =Operational difficulties= For much of the 18th century and until 1815, the main complaints about prize money concerned delays in its payment and practices that deprived ordinary seamen of much of what was due to them. Although the incidence of captains selling captured ships abroad and defrauding crews of prize money reduced greatly in the course of the century, payment was often by way of a promissory note, or ticket to be paid when the relevant naval department had funds. Although officers could generally afford to wait for payment, which was often made only in London and sometimes in instalments that might stretch over several years, most seamen sold their promissory notes at a large discount. Bromley 474-476 Other seamen authorised another individual to collect their prize money, who did not always pass it on, or lost out when they transferred to a new ship, if their prize money were not forwarded. A final issue of contention was that the value of prizes assessed in overseas Vice-Admiralty courts could be reassessed in the Admiralty Court in Britain if the Admiralty appealed the initial valuation. Excessive valuations in Vice- Admiralty courts, particularly in the West Indies, arose because the courts charged fees based on the prizes' values. Rodger (1986) 317-318This led to delays and possible reduced payments. Malcomson, 65-66 To some extent, delays arose from the time taken by Vice-Admiralty courts adjudicating whether captured ships were legitimate prizes and, if they were, their value. In the War of 1812, the Vice-Admiralty courts at Halifax, Nova Scotia and, to a lesser extent, Bermuda had to deal with many, often small, American ships captured both by privateers and naval vessels, leading to lengthy legal delays in adjudication. Once an adjudication was made, providing there was no appeal, the funds from the sale of a captured ship or its goods should have been available for payment within two years, but the whole process from capture to payment might take three years or more. Malcomson, 63-64 Under the so-called joint capture rules, which did not apply to privateers, any Royal Navy ship present when a capture took place was entitled to share in the prize money. However, this rule led to disputes where, for example, three claimant ships had been pursuing the captured ship but were out of sight when another captured it, or where a squadron commander claimed a share in a prize captured by his subordinate in disobedience to that commander‚Äôs orders. In order to minimise disputes, some captains and crews of ships on the same mission made time-limited agreements to share prize money. Malcomson, 64-65 In the case of privateers, for one to claim a share of prize money, it had to give actual assistance to the ship making the capture unless there were a prior agreement between privateers to share prizes. Van Niekerk 119 Scotland and Ireland =Scotland= The Kingdom of Scotland had its own Lord High Admiral from mediaeval times until 1707, except for the period 1652 to 1661. His jurisdiction over Scottish ships, waters and coasts, exercised through a High Court of Admiralty, was similar to that of his English equivalent. Murdoch 10 237 In 1652, the Scottish fleet that was absorbed into the Commonwealth fleet and, although a separate Scottish Admiralty was re-established in 1661, it had no warships designed as such until three relatively small ones were commissioned in 1696. Murdoch 230 236 However, as Scotland was involved in the Second (1665‚Äì67) and Third Anglo-Dutch Wars (1672‚Äì74) against the Dutch and their allies, the Scottish Admiralty commissioned a significant number of privateers in both conflicts by issuing Letters of marque. Murdoch 27, 238-240 Although Scottish privateers were generally successful in 1666 and later, their activities in 1665 were limited, because of delays in the Scottish Admiral issuing regular Letters of marque at the start of the war. Graham 68 At least 80 privateers operating from Scottish ports in these two wars have been identified, and contemporaries estimated as many as 120 may have operated against Dutch and Danish merchant ships, including some English ships operating under Scottish commissions. Murdoch 240-241 Apart from ships of the Dutch East India Company, many Dutch merchant ships and of its Danish ally were poorly armed and undermanned. Most of these engaged in Atlantic trade had to sail around the north of Scotland to avoid the English Channel in wartime, and the Dutch whaling and herring fleets operated in waters north and east of Scotland, so they were vulnerable Scottish privateers, who were particularly successful in the Second Anglo-Dutch War. Graham 69-70 The owners of privateering vessels, were entitled to the greater part of the value of their prizes, as their ordinary seamen usually served for wages rather than a share of prize money. Murdoch 177 =Ireland= Admirals of Ireland were appointed in the late middle ages to what was a mainly honorific position involving few official tasks. However, from the late 16th century, these admirals became the Irish representatives of the Lord Admiral of England. They were sometimes referred to as the Vice-Admiral of Ireland, but had no control over the royal fleet in Irish waters. Ireland also had its own Admiralty Court from the late 16th century, mainly staffed by English admiralty officials and with a jurisdiction was broadly similar to that of its English counterpart. Appleby & O'Dowd 229-300 Much of its activities concerned the many pirates operating off the coast of Ireland during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The Irish Admiralty had no ships of its own and no authority to issue Letters marque to privateers, but could seize and condemn pirate and enemy ships in Irish ports. Appleby & O'Dowd 307, 315-316 The Irish Admiralty was granted permission to establish a prize court at the time of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, which was considered to be the equivalent of the Vice- Admiralty courts in British colonies. Costello 40 At the outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1744, the Irish Admiralty Court managed to extend its powers and jurisdiction by obtaining independent prize jurisdiction and enhancing its status from that of a Vice-Admiralty to that of an independent court. Costello 23, 26 France In France, prize jurisdiction lay with the Admiral of France until that office was suppressed in 1627. A commission of jurists, the Prize Council (Conseil des Prises), was established in 1659 to deal with the adjudication of all prizes and the distribution of prize money, although many French privateers tried to evade its scrutiny. Cormack 76 Cormack (2002), p.76. The Prize Council only functioned in times of war until 1861: it then became permanent until its dissolution in 1965.Archives du Conseil des Prises 1854 to 1965//https://francearchives.fr/fr/findingaid/f0164f7014d16d2cb68bc56607a6700eebf6c874 Although officers and men of the French Navy were, in principle, entitled to prize money, and depriving men of prize money due to them was an established disciplinary measure, awards were relatively rare. Cormack 27 During the 17th and 18th centuries, French naval strategy alternated between that of Guerre d‚ÄôEscadre, maintaining a fully-equipped battle fleet for control of the sea, and Guerre de Course, sometimes using naval ships but more often privateers, including smaller naval warships leased to private individuals, to destroy an enemy‚Äôs maritime commerce. Although these alternatives had a strategic basis, only Guerre de Course was viable when financial problems prevented the maintenance of a battle fleet. Symcox 3-5 Even when it was possible to equip a battle fleet, the French naval doctrine that a fleet must avoid any action that might prevent it carrying out its designated mission, prioritised defensive tactics which made captures and prize money unlikely. Jenkins 108, 342 When a policy of commerce raiding was adopted, the major warships were laid up, but many of the smaller warships manned by the officers and men of the French Navy, were leased by the French Crown to contractors, who paid the fitting-out and running costs of these ships, and agreed to pay the Crown one- fifth of the value of all captures. Jenkins 100-102 Jenkins (1973), These ships were, however, regarded as privateers, and other privateers were entirely financed by private individuals: in both cases, the privateers operated as their owners and lessees wished, outside if government control. Privateering denied the French Navy of recruits who were experienced seamen, already in short supply in France. Cormack 25 Under an ordinance of 1681, privateers, both those using their own ships and those leasing royal ships were required to register with an officer of the Admiralty and make a substantial cautionary deposit. Any prize obtained by a privateer was to be surveyed by representatives of the Prize Council, who would recover their costs out of the sale proceeds, and retain a tenth of the net proceeds as the Admiralty portion. Vallan 4-6 Officers and men of the French Royal Navy were entitled to share four-fifths of the value of a merchant ship captured, with one tenth of the proceeds retained by the Admiralty and a further tenth for sick and injured seamen. Gun money for an enemy warship or armed privateer captured or destroyed. Vallan 14-16 The Admiralty tenth was sometimes waived when the government wished to encourage commerce raiding, and the distribution of prize money to the officers and crews, and to owners of private ships, was governed by custom, not by any ordinance. The Prize Council was notorious for the lengthy delays in dealing with cases, during which the prizes and their cargoes deteriorated. Symcox 173 Prize money was awarded to French naval personnel up to 1916, after which amounts that would have been paid as prize money were allocated to a fund for naval widows and wounded. Parillo (2013) 526 Dutch Republic During the Dutch Revolt, William the Silent as sovereign Prince of Orange, was able to issue Letters of marque to privateers and, before the end of the 16th century five partly autonomous admiralties had emerged, under the oversight of the States General. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the each of these was responsible for providing warships to the navy of the Dutch Republic and acting as prize courts for captures by both for their own warships and for privateers to whom they had given commissions, although these were formally issued in the name of the States General. Bruijn(2011) 5 p. 5. From the 1620s, the States General also delegated authority to the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company to issue Letters of marque valid within each company‚Äôs area of operation. Lunsford 118-182 In the 17th century, the greatest number of privateers operated under the jurisdiction of the Admiralty of Zeeland, and its councillors based in Middelburg spent a great deal of time dealing with the complex business of adjudicating prizes. Prizes were normally sold by auction, and the large numbers captured in the 17th century wars against Spain, England and France depressed prices and restricted the prize money crews received.

In the 17th century, the greatest number of privateers operated under the jurisdiction of the Admiralty of Zeeland, and its councillors based in Middelburg spent a great deal of time dealing with the complex business of adjudicating prizes. Prizes were normally sold by auction, and the large numbers captured in the 17th century wars against Spain, England and France depressed prices and restricted the prize money crews received. Bruijn(2011) 8 Although prize money was an important supplement to the income of the officers of Dutch warships, there has been little research on how the five admiralties calculated the amounts of prize money distributed to the officers and men capturing prizes. The Lieutenant-Admiral of an admiralty generally received four times as much as the captain responsible for a capture, and the Vice- Admiral twice as much: in both cases, these flag-officers shared in all ships and goods taken by captains in their admiralties, even when not present at the capture. Bruijn(2011) 44, 104 In 1640, Maarten Tromp, a Lieutenant-Admiral was owed 13,800 guilders, mostly his share of prize money from the Battle of the Downs the previous year. Both captains and flag officers in the Dutch fleet sometimes put the pursuit of prize money before discipline. In the Four Days' Battle of June 1666, several Dutch ships left the fleet either towing English ships they had captured or in pursuit of prizes, Fox 212, 218 and Cornelis Tromp was extremely reluctant to burn after it had run aground and been damaged, despite the orders of his commander, Michiel de Ruyter. Tromp attempted to claim compensation for its loss for many years. Fox 240 For ordinary seamen, prize money was rare, the amounts small and payment was often delayed. Bruijn(2011) 46 In many cases, prize money was paid in installments over several years and crew members frequently sold advance notes for the later instalments at far below their face value, especially in the 18th century, when several of the Admiralties were in financial difficulties. Bruijn(2011) 119-120 Privateering was already established when the Dutch Republic broke away from Spain: it quickly developed in the late 16th century and expended further in the 17th century. Lunsford 118, 182. In many cases, Dutch privateers attempted to evade the prize rules, by attacking neutral or even Dutch ships, failing to bring captures or their cargoes for adjudication and removing and selling cargoes to avoid paying duties. Lunsford, 155-156 Privateers licensed by the two Dutch India companies were aggressive in attacking what they termed interlopers in their areas of operations, regardless of nationality, and both companies were active in privateering in the three Anglo-Dutch wars. . Lunsford 183-184 During the Eighty Years' War, the main targets of Dutch privateers were Spanish and Portuguese ships, including those of the Spanish Netherlands. Privateers licensed by the West India Company were very active against ships trading with Brazil. Klooster 43-44 The privateers that had attacked Portuguese shipping had to cease doing so after the 1661 Treaty of The Hague, but many quickly transferred their activities to attacking English shipping after 1665 during the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch wars. Bruijn (2011) 145. However, there was relatively little Dutch privateering after the end of the War of the Spanish Succession, a consequence of the general decline in Dutch maritime activity. Bruijn (2008) 56 United States =To 1814= During the Revolutionary War period, the Continental Congress had no navy and relied heavily on privateers who had been authorised by one of the states to capture British ships. Admiralty Courts for the state that had authorised the privateer adjudicated on the ownership of captured vessels and their value, and were subject to oversight by a committee of Congress. Mask & Mac Mahon 477, 480 The Continental Navy, formed in 1775 was small and outmatched by the Royal Navy, whereas American privateers captured about 600 British merchant ships in the course of this conflict. Mask & Mac Mahon 487 In 1787, the US Constitution transferred the right to grant Letters of Marque from the states to Congress. Parrillo (2007) 3 At the start of the War of 1812, the few larger US Navy ships were laid-up, while the Royal Navy had relatively few resources available in the western Atlantic, leaning the field free for privateers on both sides. Kert 7-8 However, once the US Navy frigates were brought back into commission, they achieved some spectacular successes against weaker British frigates, with Stephen Decatur and John Rodgers both receiving over 10,000 dollars in prize money. Kert 114 However, later in the war, the Royal Navy succeeded in blockading the US Eastern seaboard and capturing several US Navy vessels and a number of merchant ships, and also stifling American privateer activity, although single US Navy warships managed to avoid the blockade and attack British shipping in the Caribbean and off South America. Kert 116-116 From the inception of its navy, the United States government granted naval personnel additional payments of two kinds, prize money, being a share in the proceeds from captured enemy merchant vessels and their cargo, and head money, a cash reward from the US Treasury for sinking enemy warships. From 1791, US Navy personnel received half the proceeds of a prize of equal or inferior force, and all the proceeds of a vessel of superior force. Privateers, in contrast, received all the proceeds of any prize, but had to pay duties that rose to 40% during the War of 1812, although they were lower at other times. Generally, half of the net amount went to the owners of the privateer, half to the crew. Parillo (2007), 24 From 1800, US Navy ships that sunk an armed enemy ship received a bounty of twenty dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action, divided among the crew of that ship in the same proportions as other prize money. Parillo (2007), 25 =Distribution= Under United States legislation of 1800, whether the officers and men of the navy ship or ships responsible for the capturing a prize were entitled to half of the assessed value of the prize, or the whole value in the case of a capture of superior force, the prize money fund was to be allocated in specified proportions. The captain or captains of vessels taking prizes were entitled to 10% of the prize money fund, and the commander of the squadron to 5% of the fund. In the event that the captain was operating independently, he received 15% of the prize fund. Naval lieutenants, captains of marines and sailing Masters were to share 10%, increased to approximately 12% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Chaplains, lieutenants of marines, surgeons, pursers, boatswains, gunners, carpenters, and master‚Äôs mates shared 10% of the prize fund, reduced to approximately 8% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Midshipman, junior warrant offices and the mates of senior warrant officers shared 17.5% and a range of petty officers a further 12.5%. This left 35% for the rest of the crew. Any unclaimed prize money was to be retained jointly by the Navy and Treasury secretaries to fund disability pensions and half-pay. Peters 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X =From 1815= For most of the period between the end of the War of 1812 and the start of the American Civil War, there was little opportunity to gain prize money. After the outbreak of the Civil War, the Confederate States granted some 30 commissions or Letters of marque to privateers, which captured between 50 and 60 United States merchant ships. However, a declaration by Abraham Lincoln that Confederate privateers would be treated as pirates and the closure of the ports of European colonies in the Caribbean as venues for the disposal of prize vessels and cargoes encouraged their owners to turn to Blockade running. Peifer 98-99 From 1861, US Navy ships engaged Confederate privateers and Blockade runners: as the 1800 legislation only applied to enemies of the United States, which did not recognise the Confederate States, it was unclear if prize money would apply. However, a revised statute of 1864 stated that \\"the provisions of this title shall apply to all captures made as prize by authority of the United States\\", allowing prize money claims to be made. Library of Congress, 315, Section 33 Over 11 million dollars of prize money was paid to US Navy personnel for captures in the Civil War period. It has been calculated that about one-third of prize money due was payable to officers under the prevailing rules, but that approximately half of the money actually paid went to officers, most probably because of the difficulty in tracing enlisted men when payments were delayed. Parillo (2013), 66 In 1856, the Declaration of Paris was signed: this outlawed privateering by the ships of the 55 nations that signed it. However, the United States did not sign the declaration, in part because it considered that, if privateering were to be abolished, the capture of merchant ships by naval vessels should also cease. Despite this, the United States agreed to respect the declaration during the American Civil War, although Lincoln's cabinet did discuss the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy. Parillo (2007) 63 A number of changes were made to the allocation of prize money to US Navy personnel in the 19th century in the last being in 1864. This preserved the awards 5% of the prize fund to commanders of the squadron, which now also applied to fleet commanders of fleet and of 10% to captains under the immediate command of a flag officer or 15% for those operating independently. It added new awards of 2% for a commander of a division of a fleet under the orders of a fleet commander and 1% for a fleet captain stationed on the flagship. The most significant change was that the residue of prize money after making these awards was to be divided amongst the remaining officers and men in proportion to their rates of pay. This law also increased the bounty or head money for destroying an enemy warship in action, or any other enemy ship that it was necessary to destroy was increased to 100 dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action on a ship of less or equal force, or 200 dollars for each crew member of an enemy ship of greater force, to be divided among the officers and men of the US ship in the same proportions as other prize money. Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11 The small size of US Navy meant that privateering would be the main way it could attack enemy commerce. In the Civil War, Lincoln's cabinet had discussed the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy, Until the early 1880s, American naval opinion considered that privateering remained a viable option, although subsequent increases in the size of the US Navy changed this view. Parillo (2007) 4 10-11 In the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898, neither the United States nor Spain issued commissions to privateers. However, the US Navy was granted what were to be last payments of prize money made by the US Treasury for that war. These were to sailors that took part in the battles of Manila Bay and Santiago and divided prize funds of 244,400 dollars and 166,700 dollars respectively, based on the estimated numbers of Spanish sailors and the value of ships salvaged at Manilla. Knauth 70, 73 =Abolition= During the Spanish American War in 1898, the US Navy was seen by much of the United States population as seeking to profit from prize money and head money to an unacceptable extent, even though the amounts of granted were relatively modest. All awards of prize money and head money to US Navy personnel were abolished by an overwhelming vote of Congress in March 1899, shortly after the Spanish-American War concluded. Parillo (2013) 47, 308-309 It is sometimes claimed that the US Navy last paid prize money in 1947.Nofi, Al (20 July 2008). \\"The Last \\"Prize\\" Awards in the U.S. Navy?\\" (205). and USS Somers (DD-381) intercepted the German cargo ship Odenwald on 6 November 1941 while on Neutrality Patrol in the area of the western Atlantic in which the United States had prohibited warships of belligerent powers from operating. Although the Odenwald was not a warship, it was sailing under the United States flag and claiming to be registered there, and also carrying contraband, either of which rendered the ship liable to arrest although not condemnation as a prize. After the Odenwald was stopped, its crew tried to scuttle it and took to the lifeboats. However, a boarding party from the Omaha managed to prevent the Odenwald from sinking and sailed it first to Trinidad, then to Puerto Rico. The United States was not at war with Germany at the time, and after the war, the Odenwald‚Äôs owners claimed that its seizure was therefore illegal. The Admiralty Court in Puerto Rico, however, ruled in 1947 that the crew‚Äôs attempt to scuttle the ship, and then abandon, it meant that the Omaha‚Äôs boarding party and salvage party that jointly brought the Odenwald to port had salvage rights, worth approximately 3 million dollars. It also ruled explicitly that it was not a case of bounty or prize. Justia US Law.

However, between 1775 and 1815, revenues declined sharply, largely because the probability of seizing a prize ship fell dramatically, partly owing to the increasing numbers of naval vessels competing for captures. As outfitting and manning ships for commerce raiding was expensive, privateering became less financially attractive. Hillmann & Gathmann 732, 740, 746-748 The Declaration of Paris 1856, by outlawing privateering by ships of signatory nations, would have made it politically difficult for non-signatories, which included the United States to commission privateers in a future conflict, Parillo (2007) 63 and the privateering using metal-hulled steamships presented the additional problems of maintaining complex engines, the need for frequent re-coaling and to repair more complex damage than that experienced by wooden- hulled sailing ships. In addition, after 1880, many maritime countries paid subsidies so that liners and other fast merchant vessels were built with a view to conversion into Armed Merchant Cruisers under naval control in wartime, which replaced the need for privateers, and no privateers were commissioned after the American Civil War.

Normally, a sonata form exposition has two main key areas. The first asserts the primary key of the piece, that is, the tonic. The second section moves to a different key, establishes that key firmly, arriving ultimately at a cadence in that key. For the second key, composers normally chose the dominant for major-key sonatas, and the relative major (or less commonly, the minor-mode dominant) for minor-key sonatas. The three-key exposition moves not directly to the dominant or relative major, but indirectly via a third key; hence the name. Examples * A very early example appears in the first movement Haydn's String Quartet in D major, Op. 17 No. 6: the three keys are D major, C major, and A major. (C major is prepared by a modulation to the its relative minor A minor, which happens to be the dominant minor of the original key.) * Ludwig van Beethoven wrote a number of sonata movements during the earlier part of his career with three- key expositions. For the \\"third\\" (that is, the intermediate) key, Beethoven made various choices: the dominant minor (Piano Sonata No. 2, Op. 2 no. 2; String Quartet No. 5, Op. 18 no. 5), the supertonic minor (Piano Sonata No. 3, Op. 2 no. 3), and the relative minor (Piano Sonata No. 7, Op. 10 no. 3). Later, Beethoven used the supertonic major (Piano Sonata No. 9, Op. 14 no. 1, Piano Sonata No. 11, Op. 22), which is only a mild sort of three-key exposition, since the supertonic major is the dominant of the dominant, and commonly arises in any event as part of the modulation. As he entered his so- called \\"middle period,\\" Beethoven abandoned the three-key exposition. This was part of a general change in the composer's work in which he moved closer to the older practice of Haydn, writing less discursive and more closely organized sonata movements. * Franz Schubert, who liked discursive forms for the entirety of his short career, also employed the three-key expositions in many of his sonata movements. A famous example is the first movement of the Death and the Maiden Quartet in D minor, in which the exposition moves to F major and then A minor (translated to D major and minor respectively in the recapitulation), a formula that is repeated in the final movement; another is the Violin Sonata in A major (in which the second theme appears in G major and B major, while only the closing passage of the exposition is in the dominant, E major). His B major piano sonata, D 575, even uses a four-key exposition (B major, G major, E major, F-sharp major): this key scheme is literally transposed up a fourth for the recapitulation. The finale of his sixth symphony (D 589) is an even more extreme case: its exposition passes from C major to G major by way of A-flat major, F major, A major, and E-flat major, making a six-key exposition. * Felix Mendelssohn followed the Death and the Maiden example in the first movement of his second Piano Trio, in which the E flat major second theme gives way to a G minor close (transposed to C major and minor in the recapitulation). * The first movement of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's Piano Concerto in F minor also has a three-key exposition (F minor, A-flat major, C minor). * The first movement of the second cello sonata by Brahms also employs a three-key exposition moving to C major and then A minor, the exposition of the first movement of the String Sextet in B flat involves an intervening theme in A major before reaching F, and the Piano Quartet in G minor involves secondary themes in D minor and major respectively (the first of these being omitted in the recapitulation and the second transposed to E flat major moving back to G minor). The D minor violin sonata has a final movement that moves through a calm second theme in C major before closing the exposition in A minor.  Further reading  *Longyear, Rey M., and Kate R.

It was written from scratch by Andrew S. Tanenbaum in the 1980s and aimed to replicate the structure of the Unix File System while omitting complex features, and was intended to be a teaching aid. It largely fell out of favour among Linux users by 1994 due to the popularity of other filesystems - most notably ext2 - and its lack of features, including limited partition sizes and filename length limits. History MINIX was written from scratch by Andrew S. Tanenbaum in the 1980s, as a Unix-like operating system whose source code could be used freely in education. The MINIX file system was designed for use with MINIX; it copies the basic structure of the Unix File System but avoids any complex features in the interest of keeping the source code clean, clear and simple, to meet the overall goal of MINIX to be a useful teaching aid. When Linus Torvalds first started writing his Linux operating system kernel (1991), he was working on a machine running MINIX, and adopted its file system layout. This soon proved problematic, since MINIX restricted filename lengths to fourteen characters (thirty in later versions), it limited partitions to 64 megabytes, and the file system was designed for teaching purposes, not performance. The Extended file system (ext; April 1992) was developed to replace MINIX's, but it was only with the second version of this, ext2, that Linux obtained a commercial-grade file system. As of 1994, the MINIX file system was \\"scarcely in use\\" among Linux users. Design and implementation A MINIX file system has six components: *The Boot Block which is always stored in the first block. It contains the boot loader that loads and runs an operating system at system startup. *The second block is the Superblock which stores data about the file system, that allows the operating system to locate and understand other file system structures. For example, the number of inodes and zones, the size of the two bitmaps and the starting block of the data area. *The inode bitmap is a simple map of the inodes that tracks which ones are in use and which ones are free by representing them as either a one (in use) or a zero (free). *The zone bitmap works in the same way as the inode bitmap, except it tracks the zones. *The inodes area. Each file or directory is represented as an inode, which records metadata including type (file, directory, block, char, pipe), IDs for user and group, three timestamps that record the date and time of last access, last modification and last status change. An inode also contains a list of addresses that point to the zones in the data area where the file or directory data is actually stored. *The data area is the largest component of the file system, using the majority of the space. It is where the actual file and directory data are stored.

Rogers served in the British army during both the French and Indian War and the American Revolution. During the French and Indian War, Rogers raised and commanded the famous Rogers' Rangers, trained for raiding and close combat behind enemy lines. Early life Robert Rogers was born to Ulster-Scots settlers, James and Mary McFatridge Rogers on 7 November 1731 in Methuen, a small town in northeastern Massachusetts. At that time, the town served as a staging point for Scots-Irish settlers bound for the wilderness of New Hampshire. In 1739 when Rogers was eight years old, his family relocated to the Great Meadow district of New Hampshire near present-day Concord, where James founded a settlement on of land which he called Munterloney, after a hilly place in County Londonderry, Ireland. Rogers referred to this childhood residence as \\"Mountalona\\". It was later renamed Dunbarton, New Hampshire. In 1740, the War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1748) broke out in Europe and, in 1744, the war spread to North America, where it was known as King George's War (1744‚Äì1748). During Rogers' youth (1746), he saw service in the New Hampshire militia as a private in Captain Daniel Ladd's Scouting Company and, in 1747, also as a private in Ebenezer Eastman's Scouting Company, both times guarding the New Hampshire frontier. In 1754, Rogers became involved with a gang of counterfeiters. He was indicted but the case was never brought to trial. French and Indian War Join, or Die, Benjamin Franklin's cartoon of the French and Indian War, later reused for the Revolutionary War In 1755, war engulfed the colonies, spreading also to Europe. Britain and France declared war on each other. The British in America suffered a string of defeats including Braddock's at the Battle of the Monongahela trying to capture Fort Dusquense. Encouraged by the French victories, American Indians launched a series of attacks along the colonial frontier. During the French and Indian War, Israel Putnam (who would go on to later fame in the Revolutionary War) fought as a Connecticut militia captain in conjunction with Rogers, and at one point saved his life. =Ranger recruiter= John Winslow, for whom Rogers recruited his Rangers In 1756, Rogers arrived in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and began to muster soldiers for the British Crown, using the authority vested in him by Colonel Winslow. Rogers' recruitment drive was well supported by the frightened and angry provincials due to attacks by American Indians along the frontier. In Portsmouth, he also met his future wife Elizabeth Browne, the youngest daughter of Anglican Reverend Arthur Browne. Robert's brothers James, Richard, and possibly John all served in Rogers' Rangers. Richard died of small pox in 1757 at Fort William Henry. His corpse was later disinterred and mutilated by hostile Indians. =Rogers and the Rangers= Rogers raised and commanded the famous Rogers' Rangers that fought for the British during the French and Indian War. This militia unit operated primarily in the Lake George and Lake Champlain regions of New York. They frequently undertook winter raids against French towns and military emplacements, traveling on sleds, crude snowshoes, and even ice skates across frozen rivers. Rogers' Rangers were never fully respected by the British regulars, yet they were one of the few non-Indian forces able to operate in the inhospitable region despite harsh winter conditions and mountainous terrain. Rogers showed an unusual talent for commanding his unit in conditions to which the regular armies of the day were unaccustomed. He took the initiative in mustering, equipping, and commanding ranger units. He wrote an early guide for commanding such units as Robert Rogers' 28 \\"Rules of Ranging\\". The Queen's York Rangers of the Canadian Army, the U.S. Army Rangers, and the 1st Battalion 119th Field Artillery all claim Rogers as their founder, and \\"Rogers' Standing Orders\\" are still quoted on the first page of the U.S. Army's Ranger handbook. Rogers was personally responsible for paying his soldiers, and he went deeply into debt and took loans to ensure that they were paid properly after their regular pay was raided during transport. He was never compensated by the British Army or government, though he had reason to believe that he should have his expenses reimbursed. =Northern campaign= :For more details on this topic, see Battle on Snowshoes (1757), Battle on Snowshoes and Battle of Carillon. From 1755 to 1758, Rogers and his rangers served under a series of unsuccessful British commanders operating over the northern accesses to the British colonies: Major General William Johnson, Major General William Shirley, Colonel William Haviland, and Major General James Abercromby. At the time, the British could do little more than fight defensive campaigns around Lake Champlain, Crown Point, Ticonderoga, and the upper Hudson. During this time, the rangers proved indispensable; they grew gradually to twelve companies, as well as several additional contingents of Indians who had pledged their allegiance to the British cause. The rangers were kept organizationally distinct from British regulars. Rogers was their acting commandant, as well as the direct commander of his own company. On 21 January 1757 at the First Battle of the Snowshoes, Rogers' Rangers ambushed and captured seven Canadiens near Fort Carillon but then encountered a hundred French and Canadian militia and Ottawa Indians from the Ohio Country. Roger's forces retreated after taking casualties of 14 killed, nine wounded, and six missing or captured; the French-Indian forces were 11 killed, 27 wounded. British forces surrendered Fort William Henry in August 1757, after which the Rangers were stationed on Rogers Island near Fort Edward. This allowed them to train and operate with more freedom than the regular British forces. On 13 March 1758 at the Second Battle of the Snowshoes, Rogers' Rangers ambushed a French and Indian column and, in turn, were ambushed by enemy forces. The Rangers lost 125 men in this encounter, as well as eight men wounded, with 52 surviving. Rogers estimated 100 killed and nearly 100 wounded of the French-Indian forces; however, the French listed casualties as a total of ten Indians killed and seventeen wounded. On 7 July 1758, Rogers' Rangers took part in the Battle of Ticonderoga. Abenakis (18th-century) In 1758, Abercromby recognized Rogers' accomplishments by promoting him to Major, with the equally famous John Stark as his second in command. Rogers now held two ranks appropriate to his double role: Captain and Major. In 1759, the tide of the war turned and the British advanced on the city of Quebec. Major General Jeffrey Amherst, the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of British forces in North America, had a brilliant and definitive idea. He dispatched Rogers and his rangers on an expedition far behind enemy lines to the west against the Abenakis at Saint- Francis in Quebec, a staging base for Indian raids into New England. Rogers led a force of two hundred rangers from Crown Point, New York, deep into French territory to Saint-Francis. At this time, the Indians near Saint- Francis had given up their aboriginal way of life and were living in a town next to a French mission. Rogers burned the town and claimed to have killed 200; the actual number was 30 killed and 5 captured. Rogers losses were 41 killed; 7 wounded 10 captured. Following the 3 October 1759 attack and successful destruction of Saint-Francis, Rogers' force ran out of food during their retreat back through the rugged wilderness of northern Vermont. The Rangers reached a safe location along the Connecticut River at the abandoned Fort Wentworth. Rogers left them encamped, and returned a few days later with food and relief forces from Fort at Number 4, now Charlestown, New Hampshire, the nearest British town. The destruction of Saint-Francis by Rogers was a major psychological victory, as the colonists no longer felt that they were helpless. The residents of Saint-Francis, a combined group of Abenakis and others, understood that they were no longer beyond reach. Abenaki raids along the frontier did not cease, but significantly diminished.

Roger's was then part of William Haviland's thrust (one of three all led by Amherst) on Montreal in August where it marched from Lake Ontario in the west along the Saint Lawrence River and from upper New York via the Richelieu River. Along the way Rogers fought to reduce √éle aux Noix which succeeded in a ruse attack. Soon after Fort Saint Jean was burned by the French; and Chambly was seized. The Rangers then led the final advance on Montreal which surrendered without a fight the following month. =Western campaign= Rogers then advanced with Indian activity ceased against colonials in the east, and Rogers' service there was over. General Amherst transferred him to Brigadier General Robert Monckton, commanding at Fort Pitt (formerly Fort Duquesne). Following Amherst's advice, Monckton sent the rangers to capture Detroit, far to the north, which they did. On 29 November 1760 in Detroit, Rogers received the submission of the French posts on the Great Lakes; during the spring 1761, Rogers and his Rangers occupied Fort Michilimackinac and Fort St. Joseph. It was the final act of his command. Shortly thereafter, his rangers were disbanded. Monckton offered Rogers command of a company of regulars in South Carolina but, after visiting the place, Rogers chose instead to command another company in New York. That unit was soon disbanded, however, and Rogers was forced into retirement at half-pay. No longer preoccupied with military affairs, Rogers returned to New England to marry Elizabeth Browne in June, 1761, and set up housekeeping with her in Concord, New Hampshire. Like many New Englanders, they had indentured servants and slaves, including an Indian boy captured at Saint-Francis. Some historians claim that the state of Rogers' finances at this time is not compatible with what he and others professed it to be later. Rogers received large grants of land in southern New Hampshire in compensation for his services. He sold much of it at a profit and was able to purchase and maintain slaves. He deeded much of his land to his wife's family, which served to support her later. In peacetime, Rogers was a restless spirit. The colonists were in the process of quelling Indian operations piecemeal. Late in 1761, he accepted command of a company of mercenaries for the purpose of \\"pacifying\\" the Cherokees in North Carolina, after which he returned home. On 10 February 1763, the French and Indian War came to an end with the Treaty of Paris (also known as the Treaty of 1763). Rogers found himself once more a soldier of fortune, still on half-pay. Later, General Thomas Gage remarked that, if the army had put him on whole pay, they could have prevented his later unfit employment (Gage's terms). Pontiac's Rebellion :For more details on this topic, see Siege of Fort Detroit and Battle of Bloody Run. The main theater of operations during Pontiac's Rebellion On 7 May 1763, Pontiac's Rebellion erupted in Michigan. Odawa war-leader Pontiac attempted to capture Fort Detroit by surprise with a force of 300 warriors. However, the British commander was aware of Pontiac's plan, and his garrison was armed and ready. Undaunted, Pontiac withdrew and laid siege to the fort. Eventually, more than 900 Indian warriors from a half-dozen tribes joined the siege of Fort Detroit. Upon hearing this news, Rogers offered his services to General Jeffrey Amherst. Rogers then accompanied Captain James Dalyell with a relief force to Fort Detroit. Their ill-fated mission was terminated at the Battle of Bloody Run on 31 July 1763. In an attempt to break Pontiac's siege, about 250 British troops led by Dalyell and Rogers attempted a surprise attack on his encampment. However, Pontiac was ready, supposedly alerted by French settlers, and he defeated the British at Parent's Creek two miles north of the fort. The creek or run was said to have run red with the blood of the 20 dead and 34 wounded British soldiers and was henceforth known as Bloody Run. Captain James Dalyell was one of those killed. Soon after these events, Pontiac's rebellion collapsed and Chief Pontiac himself faded away into obscurity and death. Surprisingly, Rogers later memorialized Pontiac and his rebellion in a stage play during his sojourn in England. Post-war success and failure Rogers had brought total dedication to his position as commander of the rangers. As was often the custom in the British and American armies, he had spent his own money to equip the rangers when needed and consequently had gone into debt. In 1764, he was faced with the problem of repaying his creditors. To recoup his finances, Robert engaged briefly in a business venture with the fur trader, John Askin, near Detroit. After it failed, he hoped to win the money by gambling, with the result that he was totally ruined. His creditors put him in prison for debt in New York, but he escaped. =Author in Britain= In 1765, Rogers voyaged to England to obtain pay for his service and capitalize on his fame. His journals and A Concise Account of North America were published. Immediately thereafter, he wrote the stage play Ponteach [Pontiac]: or the Savages of America (1766), significant as an early American drama and for its sympathetic portrayal of American Indians. He enjoyed some moderate success with his publications (though Ponteach was condemned by the critics) and attracted royal attention. He had an audience with King George III, to whom he proposed undertaking an expedition to find the Northwest Passage. The King appointed Rogers governor of Michilimackinac (Mackinaw City, Michigan) with a charter to look for the passage, and he returned to North America. =Royal Governor= Upon his return to America, Rogers moved with his wife to the fur- trading outpost of Fort Michilimackinac and began his duties as royal governor. During Rogers' absence, Amherst had been replaced by Thomas Gage as commander of the British forces in America, and Gage was a bitter rival of Amherst. Rogers was a loyal friend of Amherst and was consequently hated by Gage. Thomas Gage bitterly disliked Rogers due to his close friendship with Jeffrey Amherst, Gage's rival As an aristocrat and political intriguer, Gage viewed Rogers as a provincial upstart who posed a threat to his newly acquired power, due to his friendship with Amherst. At the time, Rogers was still a half-pay captain in the British army and, to some degree, under Gage's military jurisdiction. However, Gage could not challenge Rogers, the king's appointee, unless he could find a good reason, as the king would countermand any legal process in order to save his favorites. Knowing this, Gage actively set about finding a solid justification to remove Rogers as royal governor in a way that would forestall royal intervention. Unaware of Gage's plotting, Rogers continued performing his administrative duties with considerable zest. He dispatched expeditions to search for the fabled Northwest Passage under Jonathan Carver and James Tute, but they were unsuccessful and the path to the Pacific Ocean remained undiscovered until the expedition led by Alexander MacKenzie in 1793. Rogers perceived a need for unity and a stronger government, and he negotiated with the Indians, parlayed with the French, and developed a plan for a province in Michigan to be administered by a governor and Privy Council reporting to the king. This plan was supported by George III, but had little chance of being adopted, since Parliament had no intention of increasing the king's power. Meanwhile, Gage used every opportunity to defame Rogers, portraying him as an opportunist who had gotten rich on the war only to gamble away his money as a profligate. It is difficult to say how many of these allegations were true and how much Gage believed them to be true. Gage apparently saw Rogers as of questionable loyalty‚Äîcertainly he was not loyal to Gage‚Äîand therefore he needed watching. Rogers' dealings with the American Indians troubled Gage, as he and many other British officers in America had come to regard the Indians with great suspicion. =Arrest for treason= Gage hired spies to intercept Rogers' mail and suborned his subordinates. Unfortunately, Rogers offended his private secretary Nathaniel Potter, and Potter gave Gage the excuse that he needed. Potter swore in an affidavit that Rogers said that he would offer his province to the French if the British government failed to approve his plan of governance. Potter's claims are questionable. The French were not in any position to receive Rogers, with a British governor sitting in Montreal. Nevertheless, on the strength of Potter's affidavit, Rogers was arrested in 1767, charged with treason, and taken to Montreal in chains for trial. This trial was postponed until 1768. Elizabeth, carrying their only child, went home to Portsmouth. This son became a lawyer in Portsmouth and had a family that has descended to modern times. =Vindication= Field Marshal Jeffrey Amherst was a close friend of Rogers and was instrumental in vindicating him of Gage's charges of treason Gage sent Rogers to Montreal to stand trial but, once there, Rogers was among friends of Amherst. Due to Amherst's influence, Rogers was acquitted of all charges and the verdict was sent to King George III for approval. The king approved, but could not call Gage a liar openly. Instead, he made a note that there was reason to think Rogers might have been treasonous. Returning to Michigan under the power of Gage was unthinkable; hence, Rogers went to England in 1769 to petition again for debt relief. However, the king had done all he would for Rogers and was preoccupied by the issue of the dissatisfied colonies. Rogers went again to debtors' prison and tried suing Gage for false imprisonment. Gage settled out of court by offering Rogers the half-pay of a major in return for dropping the suit. =American Revolutionary War= Because of his legal troubles in England, Robert Rogers missed the major events in the disaffected colonies. He heard that revolution was likely to break out and returned to America in 1775. The Americans were as out of touch with Rogers as he was with them, looking upon him as the noted ranger leader and expecting him to behave as one; they were at a total loss to explain his drunken and licentious behavior. At that time, Rogers was perhaps suffering from the alcoholism that blighted his later life and led to the loss of his family, land, money, and friends. It is unclear exactly what transpired between the revolutionary leaders and Rogers. Rogers was arrested by the local Committee of Safety as a possible spy and released on parole that he would not serve against the colonies. He was offered a commission in the Revolutionary Army by the Continental Congress, but declined on the grounds that he was a British officer. He later wrote to George Washington asking for a command, but instead Washington had him arrested. He escaped from Washington's custody only to find revolutionary ranks firm against him, so he offered his services to the British Army. They also were hoping that he would live up to his reputation. In August 1776, he formed another ranger-type unit called the Queen's Rangers as its colonel. In September 1776, Rogers assisted in the capture of Nathan Hale, a spy for the Continental Army. A contemporaneous account of Hale's capture is in the Library of Congress, written by Consider Tiffany, a Connecticut shopkeeper and Loyalist. In Tiffany's account, Rogers did not believe Hale's cover story that he was a teacher, and lured him into his own betrayal by pretending to be a patriot spy himself. In May 1777, the British Army forcibly retired Rogers on grounds of \\"poor health\\". A return home now was impossible; Hale's execution and Rogers raising troops against the colonials seemed to confirm Washington's suspicions. At Washington's prompting, the New Hampshire legislature passed two decrees regarding Rogers: one a proscription and the other a divorce from his wife on grounds of abandonment and infidelity. She could not afford any friendship or mercy toward Robert now if she expected to remain in New Hampshire. Later, Elizabeth married American naval officer John Roche. She died in 1811. Final return to England After a brief sojourn in England, Rogers returned in 1779 to raise the King's Rangers in Nova Scotia, Canada for General Sir Henry Clinton. He was unable to keep the position due to his alcoholism, and his place was taken by his brother James. Now he was of no further use to the British army. He was snared by an American privateer and spent some time in a prison in New York, escaping in 1782. In 1783, he was evacuated with other British troops to England. There, he was unable to earn a living or to defeat his alcoholism. He died in obscurity and debt in 1795, what little money he had going to pay an arrears in rent. He was buried in London but his gravesite has been lost. Legacy * John Paul Jones' ship during the American Revolutionary War was named in honor of Robert Rogers and his famous rangers.

She was raised at the Gatchina Palace outside Saint Petersburg. Olga's relationship with her mother, Empress Marie, the daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark, was strained and distant from childhood. In contrast, she and her father were close. He died when she was 12, and her brother Nicholas became emperor. In 1901, at 19, she married Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, who was privately believed by family and friends to be homosexual. Their marriage of 15 years remained unconsummated, and Peter at first refused Olga's request for a divorce. The couple led separate lives and their marriage was eventually annulled by the Emperor in October 1916. The following month Olga married cavalry officer Nikolai Kulikovsky, with whom she had fallen in love several years before. During the First World War, the Grand Duchess served as an army nurse and was awarded a medal for personal gallantry. At the downfall of the Romanovs in the Russian Revolution of 1917, she fled with her husband and children to Crimea, where they lived under the threat of assassination. Her brother Nicholas and his family were shot by revolutionaries. Olga escaped revolutionary Russia with her second husband and their two sons in February 1920. They joined her mother, the Dowager Empress, in Denmark. In exile, Olga acted as companion and secretary to her mother, and was often sought out by Romanov impostors who claimed to be her dead relatives. She met Anna Anderson, the best-known impostor, in Berlin in 1925. After the Dowager Empress's death in 1928, Olga and her husband purchased a dairy farm in Ballerup, near Copenhagen. She led a simple life: raising her two sons, working on the farm and painting. During her lifetime, she painted over 2,000 works of art, which provided extra income for both her family and the charitable causes she supported. In 1948, feeling threatened by Joseph Stalin's regime, Olga and her immediate family relocated to a farm in Campbellville, Ontario, Canada. With advancing age, Olga and her husband moved to a bungalow near Cooksville, Ontario. Colonel Kulikovsky died there in 1958. Two years later, as her health deteriorated, Olga moved with friends to a small apartment in East Toronto. She died aged 78, seven months after her older sister, Xenia. At the end of her life and afterwards, Olga was widely labelled the last Grand Duchess of Imperial Russia. Early life Alexander III, 1888.

Olga is a young girl who stands at the front resting against the arms of her seated bearded and bald father, who wears a military uniform. The older children and the empress complete the group. Olga was the youngest daughter of Emperor Alexander III and his consort, Empress Marie, formerly Princess Dagmar of Denmark. She was born in the purple (i.e., during her father's reign) on 13 June 1882 in the Peterhof Palace, west of central Saint Petersburg. Her birth was announced by a traditional 101-gun salute from the ramparts of the Peter and Paul Fortress, and similar salutes throughout the Russian Empire.Vorres, p. 3 Her mother, advised by her sister, Alexandra, Princess of Wales, placed Olga in the care of an English nanny, Elizabeth Franklin. The Russian imperial family was a frequent target for assassins, so for safety reasons the Grand Duchess was raised at the country palace of Gatchina, about 50 miles (80 km) west of Saint Petersburg. Although Olga and her siblings lived in a palace, conditions in the nursery were modest, even Spartan.Phenix, pp. 8‚Äì10; Vorres, p. 4 They slept on hard camp beds, rose at dawn, washed in cold water, and ate a simple porridge for breakfast. Olga left Gatchina for the first time in 1888 when the imperial family visited the Caucasus. On 29 October, their return train approached the small town of Borki at speed. Olga's parents and their four older children were eating lunch in the dining-car when the train lurched violently and came off the rails. The carriage was torn open; the heavy iron roof caved in, and the wheels and floor of the car were sliced off. Survivors claimed the Tsar crawled out from beneath the crushed roof, and held it up with \\"a Herculean effort\\" so that the others could escape;Vorres, p. 11 a story subsequently considered unbelievable.Harcave, p. 32 There were 21 fatalities. Empress Marie helped tend the wounded, and made makeshift bandages from her own clothes. An official investigation found that the crash was an accident,Phenix, p. 20 but it was widely and falsely believed that two bombs had been planted on the line.Vorres, p. 12 The Grand Duchess and her siblings were taught at home by private tutors. Subjects included history, geography, Russian, English, and French, as well as drawing and dancing.Vorres, pp. 18‚Äì20 Physical activities such as equestrianism were taught at an early age, and the children became expert riders.Phenix, pp. 12‚Äì13; Vorres, pp. 26‚Äì27 The family was deeply religious. While Christmas and Easter were times of celebration and extravagance, Lent was strictly observed‚Äîmeat, dairy products and any form of entertainment were avoided.Vorres, p. 30 Portrait of Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna in 1893 by Valentin Serov Empress Marie was reserved and formal with Olga as a child, and their relationship remained a difficult one.Phenix, p. 8; Vorres, p. 25 But Olga, her father, and the youngest of her brothers, Michael, had a close relationship. Together, the three frequently went on hikes in the Gatchina forests, where the Tsar taught Olga and Michael woodsmanship.Vorres, p. 24 Olga said of her father: Family holidays were taken in the summer at Peterhof, and with Olga's grandparents in Denmark.Phenix, pp. 11, 24; Vorres, pp. 33‚Äì41 However, in 1894, Olga's father became increasingly ill, and the annual trip to Denmark was cancelled.Vorres, pp. 48‚Äì52 On 13 November 1894, he died at the age of 49. The emotional impact on Olga, aged 12, was traumatic,Phenix, pp. 30‚Äì31; Vorres, pp. 54, 57 and her eldest brother, the new Tsar Nicholas II, was propelled into a role for which, in Olga's later opinion, he was ill-prepared.Vorres, p. 55 Court life Olga was due to enter society in mid-1899 at the age of 15, but after the death of her brother George at the age of 28, her first official public appearance was delayed by a year until 1900.Phenix, p. 45; Vorres, pp. 72‚Äì74 She hated the experience, and later told her official biographer Ian Vorres, \\"I felt as though I were an animal in a cage‚Äîexhibited to the public for the first time.\\"Vorres, p. 74 From 1901 Olga served as the honorary Commander-in-Chief of the of the Imperial Russian Army. The Akhtyrsky Hussars, famous for their victory over Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Kulm in 1813, wore a distinctive brown dolman.Kulikovsky-Romanoff, p. 4 By 1900, Olga, aged 18, was being escorted to the theatre and opera by a distant cousin, Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, a member of the Russian branch of the House of Oldenburg.Belyakova, p. 86 He was 14 years her senior and known for his passion for literature and gambling.Belyakova, p. 84 Peter asked for Olga's hand in marriage the following year, a proposal that took the Grand Duchess completely by surprise: \\"I was so taken aback that all I could say was 'thank you',\\" she later explained.Vorres, p. 75 Front row from left: Olga, King Chulalongkorn of Siam, Dowager Empress Marie, Tsar Nicholas II and Crown Prince Vajiravudh during the king's visit to Russia in 1897 Their engagement, announced in May 1901, surprised family and friends, as Peter had shown no prior interest in women, and members of society assumed he was homosexual.Phenix, p. 52 At the age of 19, on , Olga married 33-year-old Peter. After the celebration the newlyweds left for the Oldenburg palace on the Field of Mars. Olga spent her wedding night alone in tears, while her husband left for a gambling club, returning the next morning.Belyakova, p. 88 Their marriage remained unconsummated,Olga said: \\"I shared his roof for nearly fifteen years, and never once we were husband and wife\\" (Vorres, p. 76); see also Massie, p. 171 and Olga suspected that Peter's ambitious mother had pushed him into proposing.Vorres, pp. 75, 78 Biographer Patricia Phenix thought Olga may have accepted his proposal to gain independence from her own mother, the Dowager Empress, or to avoid marriage into a foreign court.Phenix, p. 46 The couple initially lived with her in-laws Alexander Petrovich and Eug√©nie Maximilianovna of Oldenburg. The arrangement was not harmonious, as Peter's parents, both well known for their philanthropic work, berated their only son for his laziness. Olga took a dislike to her mother-in-law; although Eug√©nie, a close friend of the Dowager Empress, gave her daughter-in-law many gifts, including a ruby tiara that Napoleon had given as a present to Jos√©phine de Beauharnais. A few weeks after the wedding Olga and her husband travelled to Biarritz, France, from where they sailed to Sorrento, Italy, on a yacht loaned to them by King Edward VII of Great Britain.Belyakova, p. 89 The Baryatinsky mansion, Saint Petersburg, in 2009 On their return to Russia, they settled into a 200-room palace (the former Baryatinsky mansion) at 46 Sergievskaya Street (present-day ) in Saint Petersburg.Vorres, p. 81 (The palace, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his sister, now houses the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry.) Olga and Peter had separate bedrooms at opposite ends of the building, and the Grand Duchess had her own art studio. Unhappy in her marriage, she fell into bouts of depression that caused her to lose her hair, forcing her to wear a wig. It took two years for her hair to regrow. Near the Oldenburgs' estate, Ramon in Voronezh province, Olga had her own villa, called \\"Olgino\\" after the local town.Vorres, pp. 78‚Äì79 She subsidized the village school out of her own pocket, and established a hospital.Kulikovsky-Romanoff, p. 3 Her daughter-in-law later wrote, \\"She tried to help every needy person as far as her strengths and means would permit.\\" At the hospital she learned basic medical treatment and proper care from the local doctor.Vorres, p. 79 She exemplified her strong Orthodox faith by creating religious icons, which she distributed to the charitable endeavours she supported. At Ramon, Olga and Peter enjoyed walking through the nearby woods and hunted wolves together.Belyakova, p. 91 He was kind and considerate towards her, but she longed for love, a normal marriage, and children. In April 1903, during a royal military review at Pavlovsk Palace, Olga's brother Michael introduced her to a Blue Cuirassier Guards officer, Nikolai Kulikovsky.Crawford and Crawford, p. 51; Phenix, p. 62; Vorres, pp. 94‚Äì95 Olga and Kulikovsky began to see each other, and exchanged letters regularly. The same year, at the age of 22, she confronted her husband and asked for a divorce, which he refused - with the qualification that he might reconsider after seven years.Phenix, p. 63; Vorres, p. 95 Nevertheless, Oldenburg appointed Kulikovsky as an aide-de-camp, and allowed him to live in the same residence as Oldenburg and the Grand Duchess on Sergievskaya Street.Crawford and Crawford, p. 52; Phenix, p. 73; Vorres, pp. 94‚Äì95. The relationship between Kulikovsky and the Grand Duchess was not public,Vorres, pp. 95‚Äì96 but gossip about their romance spread through society.A Cuirassier's Memoirs by Vladimir Trubetskoy, quoted in Phenix, p. 73. From 1904 to 1906 Duke Peter had an appointment to a military post in Tsarskoye Selo, a complex of palaces just south of Saint Petersburg. In Tsarskoye Selo, the Grand Duchess grew close to her brother Nicholas and his family, who lived at the Alexander Palace near her own residence.Vorres, pp. 97‚Äì99, 101 Olga prized her connection to the Tsar's four daughters.Massie, p. 171; Vorres, pp. 102‚Äì103 From 1906 to 1914, Olga took her nieces to parties and engagements in Saint Petersburg, without their parents, every weekend throughout the winter. She especially took a liking to the youngest of Nicholas's daughters, her god-daughter Anastasia, whom she called Shvipsik (\\"little one\\").Phenix, p. 144; Vorres, pp. 98‚Äì99 Through her brother and sister-in-law, Olga met Rasputin, a self-styled holy man who purported to have healing powers. Although she made no public criticisms of Rasputin's association with the imperial family, she was unconvinced of his supposed powers and privately disliked him.Phenix, pp. 73‚Äì83; Vorres, pp. 127‚Äì139 As Olga grew close to her brother's family, her relationship with her other surviving brother, Michael, deteriorated. To her and Nicholas's horror, Michael eloped with his mistress, a twice-divorced commoner, and communication between Michael and the rest of the family essentially ceased.Phenix, pp. 85‚Äì88; Vorres, pp. 108‚Äì109 Public unrest over the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905 and demands for political reform increased in the early years of the twentieth century. At Epiphany 1905, a band of revolutionaries fired live rounds at the Winter Palace from the Peter and Paul Fortress. Olga and the Dowager Empress were showered with glass splinters from a smashed window, but remained unharmed.Phenix, p. 68; Vorres, p. 111 Three weeks later, on \\"Bloody Sunday\\" (), Cossack troops killed at least 92 people during a demonstration,Phenix, p. 69; Vorres, p. 111 and a month later Olga's uncle, Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, was assassinated.Phenix, p. 69; Vorres, p. 112 Uprisings occurred throughout the country, and parts of the navy mutinied.Vorres, p. 113 Olga supported the appointment of the liberal Pyotr Stolypin as prime minister, and he embarked on a programme of gradual reform, but in 1911 he was assassinated.Vorres, pp. 117‚Äì119 The public unrest, Michael's elopement, and Olga's sham marriage placed her under strain, and in 1912, while visiting England with her mother, she suffered a nervous breakdown.Phenix, p. 89; Vorres, pp. 121‚Äì122 Tsarina Alexandra was also unwell with fatigue, concerned by the poor health of her hemophiliac son, Alexei.Vorres, p. 122 Olga stood in for the Tsarina at public events, and accompanied her brother on a tour of the interior, while the Tsarina remained at home.Vorres, p. 123. War and revolution Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna, Grand Duchess Maria, Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, Grand Duchess Anastasia, Tsarevitch Alexei, Grand Duchess Tatiana|alt=Black-and-white photograph of Nicholas II and family On 1 August 1914, with World War I looming, Olga's regiment, the Akhtyrsky Hussars, appeared at an Imperial Review before her and the Tsar at Krasnoe Selo.Vorres, p. 125 Kulikovsky volunteered for service with the Hussars, who were stationed on the frontlines in Southwestern Russia. With the Grand Duchess's prior medical knowledge from the village of Olgino, she started work as a nurse at an under-staffed Red Cross hospital in Rovno, near to where her own regiment was stationed.Phenix, pp. 91‚Äì92; Vorres, p. 141 During the war, she came under heavy Austrian fire while attending the regiment at the front. Nurses rarely worked so close to the frontline and consequently she was awarded the Order of St. George by General Mannerheim, who later became President of Finland. As the Russians lost ground to the Central Powers, Olga's hospital was moved eastwards to Kiev,Phenix, p. 93; Vorres, p. 143 and Michael returned to Russia from exile abroad.Phenix, p. 101 In 1916, Tsar Nicholas II annulled the marriage between Duke Peter Alexandrovich and the Grand Duchess, allowing her to marry Colonel Kulikovsky.Phenix, p. 103 The service was performed on 16 November 1916 in the Kievo-Vasilievskaya Church on Triokhsviatitelskaya (Three Saints Street) in Kiev. The only guests were the Dowager Empress, Olga's brother-in-law Grand Duke Alexander, four officers of the Akhtyrsky Regiment, and two of Olga's fellow nurses from the hospital in Kiev.Grand Duke Alexander's Memoirs, Once A Grand Duke, p. 273, quoted in Phenix, p. 104 During the war, internal tensions and economic deprivation in Russia continued to mount and revolutionary sympathies grew. After Tsar Nicholas II abdicated in early 1917, many members of the Romanov dynasty, including Nicholas and his immediate family, were detained under house arrest. In search of safety, the Dowager Empress, Grand Duke Alexander, and Grand Duchess Olga travelled to Crimea by special train, where they were joined by Olga's sister (Alexander's wife) Grand Duchess Xenia.Phenix, pp. 115‚Äì117; Vorres, pp. 149‚Äì150 They lived at Alexander's estate, Ay-Todor, about 12 miles (19 km) from Yalta, where they were placed under house arrest by the local forces.Phenix, p. 118 On 12 August 1917, her first child and son, Tikhon Nikolaevich was born during their virtual imprisonment. He was named after Tikhon of Zadonsk, the Saint venerated near the Grand Duchess's estate at Olgino. The Romanovs isolated in Crimea knew little of the fate of the Tsar and his family. Nicholas, Alexandra, and their children, were originally held at their official residence, the Alexander Palace, but the Provisional government under Alexander Kerensky relocated them to Tobolsk, Siberia. In February 1918, most of the imperial family at Ay-Todor was moved to another estate at Djulber, where Grand Dukes Nicholas and Peter were already under house arrest. Olga and her husband were left at Ay-Todor. The entire Romanov family in Crimea was condemned to death by the Yalta revolutionary council, but the executions were delayed by political rivalry between the Yalta and Sevastopol Soviets.Phenix, pp. 122‚Äì123; Vorres, pp. 155‚Äì156 By March 1918, the Central Power of Germany had advanced on Crimea, and the revolutionary guards were replaced by German ones.Phenix, pp. 123‚Äì125; Vorres, pp. 156‚Äì157 In November 1918, the German forces were informed that their nation had lost the war, and they evacuated homewards. Allied forces took over the Crimean ports, in support of the loyalist White Army, which allowed the surviving members of the Romanov family time to escape abroad. The Dowager Empress and, at her insistence, most of her family and friends were evacuated by the British warship HMS Marlborough. Nicholas II had already been shot dead and the family assumed, correctly, that his wife and children had also been killed.e.g. Letter from King George V to Victoria, Marchioness of Milford Haven, 2 September 1918, quoted in Hough, p. 326 Olga and her husband refused to leave Russia, and decided to move to the Caucasus, which the White Army had cleared of revolutionary Bolsheviks.Phenix, p. 128; Vorres, p. 159 An imperial bodyguard, Timofei Yatchik, guided them to his hometown, the large Cossack village of Novominskaya. In a rented five-room farmhouse there, Olga gave birth to her second son, Guri Nikolaevich, on 23 April 1919.Phenix, p. 129 He was named after a friend of hers, Guri Panayev, who was killed while serving in the Akhtyrsky Regiment during World War I. In November 1919, the family set out on what would be their last journey through Russia. Just ahead of revolutionary troops, they escaped to Novorossiysk, and took refuge in the residence of the Danish consul, Thomas Schytte, who informed them of the Dowager Empress's safe arrival in Denmark.Kulikovsky-Romanoff, p. 5 After a brief stay with the consul, the family was shipped to a refugee camp on the island of B√ºy√ºkada in the Dardanelles Strait near Istanbul, Turkey, where Olga, her husband and children shared three rooms with eleven other adults.Phenix, p. 132 After two weeks, they were evacuated to Belgrade in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes where she was visited by Prince Regent Alexander. Alexander offered the Grand Duchess and her family a permanent home, but Olga was summoned to Denmark by her mother. On Good Friday 1920, Olga and her family arrived in Copenhagen. They lived with the Dowager Empress, at first at the Amalienborg Palace and then at the royal estate of Hvid√∏re, where Olga acted as her mother's secretary and companion.Vorres, pp. 167‚Äì171 It was a difficult arrangement at times. The Dowager Empress insisted on having Olga at her beck and call and found Olga's young sons too boisterous. Having never reconciled with the idea of her daughter's marriage to a commoner, she was cold towards Kulikovsky, rarely allowing him in her presence. At formal functions, Olga was expected to accompany her mother alone.Be√©che, p. 116 Anna Anderson alt=Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna In 1925, Olga and Colonel Kulikovsky travelled to Berlin to meet Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Olga's niece, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. Anderson had attempted suicide in Berlin in 1920, which Olga later called \\"probably the only indisputable fact in the whole story\\".Olga quoted in Vorres, p. 173 Anderson claimed that with the help of a man named Tchaikovsky she had escaped from revolutionary Russia via Bucharest, where she had given birth to his child. Olga thought the story \\"palpably false\\",Olga quoted in Vorres, p. 175 since Anderson made no attempt to approach Queen Marie of Romania, during her entire alleged time in Bucharest. Olga said: Anderson stated she was in Berlin to inform Princess Irene of Prussia (sister of Tsarina Alexandra and cousin of Tsar Nicholas II) of her survival. Olga commented, \\"[Princess Irene] was one of the most straightlaced women in her generation. My niece would have known that her condition would have indeed have shocked [her].\\" Olga met Anderson, who was being treated for tuberculosis, at a nursing home. Of the visit Olga later said: Olga also said she was dismayed that Anderson spoke only German and showed no sign of knowing either English or Russian, while Anastasia spoke both those languages fluently and was ignorant of German.\\"My nieces knew no German at all. Mrs. Anderson did not seem to understand a word of Russian or English, the two languages all the four sisters had spoken since babyhood.\\": Olga quoted in Vorres, p. 174 Nevertheless, Olga remained sympathetic towards Anderson, perhaps because she thought that she was ill rather than deliberately deceitful.Klier and Mingay, p. 156; Vorres, p. 176 Olga later explained: Conceivably, Olga was initially either open to the possibility that Anderson was Anastasia or unable to make up her mind.Klier and Mingay, p. 102; Massie, p. 174; Phenix, p. 155 Anderson's biographer and supporter Peter Kurth claimed that Olga wrote to the Danish ambassador, Herluf Zahle, at the end of October 1925: \\"My feeling is that she is not the one she believes‚Äîbut one can't say she is not as a fact\\".Letter from Olga to Herluf Zahle, 31 October 1925, quoted in Kurth, p. 119, but with a proviso that the original letter has never been seen Within a month she had made up her mind. She wrote to a friend, \\"There is no resemblance, and she is undoubtedly not A.\\"Letter from Olga to Colonel Anatoly Mordvinov, 4 December 1925, Oberlandesgericht Archive, Hamburg, quoted in Kurth, p. 120Olga wrote in a letter to Tatiana Melnik, 30 October 1926, Botkin Archive, quoted in Kurth, p. 144; and a letter dated 13 September 1926 quoted in von Nidda, pp. 197‚Äì198: \\"However hard we tried to recognize this patient as my niece Tatiana or Anastasia, we all came away quite convinced of the reverse.\\" In a letter from Olga to Princess Irene, 22 December 1926, quoted in von Nidda, p. 168, she wrote, \\"I had to go to Berlin last autumn to see the poor girl said to be our dear little niece. Well, there is no resemblance at all, and it is obviously not Anastasia ... It was pitiful to watch this poor creature trying to prove she was Anastasia. She showed her feet, a finger with a scar and other marks which she said were bound to be recognized at once. But it was Maria who had a crushed finger, and someone must have told her this. For four years this poor creature's head was stuffed with all these stories ... It has been claimed, however, that we all recognized her and were then given instructions by Mama to deny that she was Anastasia. That is a complete lie. I believe this whole story is an attempt at blackmail.\\" Olga sent Anderson a scarf and five letters, which were used by Anderson's supporters to claim that Olga recognized Anderson as Anastasia.Klier and Mingay, p. 102; Vorres, p. 177 Olga later said she sent the gift and letters \\"out of pity\\",Olga quoted in Vorres, p. 177 and called the claims \\"a complete fabrication\\". When Olga refused to recognize Anderson as Anastasia publicly and published a statement denying any resemblance in a Danish newspaper,National Tidende, 16 January 1926, quoted in Klier and Mingay, p. 102 and Phenix, p. 155 Anderson's supporters, Harriet von Rathlef and Gleb Botkin, claimed that Olga was acting on instructions received from her sister Xenia by telegram, which Olga denied in private letters and sworn testimony.\\"I can swear to God that I did not receive before or during my visit to Berlin, either a telegram or a letter from my sister Xenia advising that I should not acknowledge the stranger.\\": Sworn testimony of Grand Duchess Olga, Staatsarchiv Hamburg, File 1991 74 0 297/57 Volume 7, pp. 1297‚Äì1315, quoted in Phenix, p. 238\\"They state that we all recognized her and that we then received an order from Mama to say that she is not Anastasia. This is a great lie!\\": Letter from Olga to Princess Irene, quoted in Klier and Mingay, p. 149 She told her official biographer, \\"I never received any such telegram.\\" The telegram was never produced by Anderson's supporters, and it has never been found among any of the papers relating to the case.Phenix, p. 238 Xenia said, Danish residency and exodus alt=Painting by Olga of a young guardsman in a two-toned blue uniform striding forward on the pavement of a cobbled street; behind him a well-dressed lady in a wide-brimmed hat walks with a small child and a pet dog, and a 1930s motor car and bicycle are in the street The Dowager Empress died on 13 October 1928 at Hvid√∏re. Her estate was sold and Olga purchased Knudsminde, a farm in Ballerup about 15 miles (24 km) from Copenhagen, with her portion of the proceeds.Phenix, p. 168; Vorres, p. 185 She and her husband kept horses, in which Colonel Kulikovsky was especially interested, along with Jersey cows, pigs, chickens, geese, dogs and cats.Hall, p. 58 For transport they had a small car and a sledge. Tihon and Guri (age thirteen and eleven, respectively when they moved to Knudsminde) grew up on the farm. Olga ran the household with the help of her elderly, faithful lady's maid Emilia Tenso (\\"Mimka\\"), who had come along with her from Russia. The Grand Duchess lived with simplicity, working in the fields, doing household chores, and painting. The farm became a center for the Russian monarchist community in Denmark, and many Russian emigrants visited.Phenix, p. 170 Olga maintained a high level of correspondence with the Russian √©migr√© community and former members of the imperial army. On 2 February 1935 in the Russian Orthodox Church in Copenhagen, she and her husband were godparents, with her cousin Prince Gustav of Denmark, to Aleksander Schalburg, son of Russian-born Danish army officer Christian Frederik von Schalburg. In the 1930s, the family took annual holidays at Sofiero Castle, Sweden, with Crown Prince Gustaf of Sweden and his wife, Louise.Vorres, p. 186 Olga began to sell her own paintings, of Russian and Danish scenes, with exhibition auctions in Copenhagen, London, Paris, and Berlin. Some of the proceeds were donated to the charities she supported. Neutral Denmark was invaded by Nazi Germany on 9 April 1940, and was occupied for the remainder of World War II. Food shortages, communication restrictions, and transport closures followed. As Olga's sons, Tikhon and Guri, served as officers in the Danish Army, they were interned as prisoners of war, but their imprisonment in a Copenhagen hotel lasted less than two months.Phenix, p. 174 Tikhon was imprisoned for a further month in 1943 after being arrested on charges of espionage.Phenix, p. 176 Other Russian √©migr√©s, keen to fight against the Soviets, enlisted in the German forces. Despite her sons' internment and her mother's Danish origins, Olga was implicated in her compatriots' collusion with German forces, as she continued to meet and extend help to Russian √©migr√©s fighting against communism.Phenix, p. 176; Vorres, p. 187 On 4 May 1945, German forces in Denmark surrendered to the British. When economic and social conditions for Russian exiles failed to improve, General Pyotr Krasnov wrote to the Grand Duchess, detailing the wretched conditions affecting Russian immigrants in Denmark.Kulikovsky-Romanoff, p. 6 She in turn asked Prince Axel of Denmark to help them, but her request was refused.Phenix, p. 178 With the end of World War II, Soviet troops occupied the Danish island of Bornholm, and the Soviet Union wrote to the Danish government accusing Olga and a Danish Catholic bishop of conspiracy against the Soviet government.Phenix, p. 179 The surviving Romanovs in Denmark grew fearful of an assassination or kidnap attempt,Phenix, pp. 179‚Äì180; Vorres, pp. 187‚Äì188 and Olga decided to move her family across the Atlantic to the relative safety of rural Canada.Mr. J. S. P. Armstrong, Agent General for Ontario, quoted in Vorres, p. 191 Emigration to Canada In May 1948, the Kulikovskys travelled to London by Danish troopship. They were housed in a grace and favour apartment at Hampton Court Palace while arrangements were made for their journey to Canada as agricultural immigrants.Vorres, pp. 188, 190 On 2 June 1948, Olga, Kulikovsky, Tikhon and his Danish-born wife Agnete, Guri and his Danish-born wife Ruth, Guri and Ruth's two children, Xenia and Leonid, and Olga's devoted companion and former maid Emilia Tenso (\\"Mimka\\") departed Liverpool on board the Empress of Canada.Vorres, p. 193 After a rough crossing, the ship docked at Halifax, Nova Scotia.Vorres, p. 196 The family lived in Toronto, until they purchased a farm in Halton County, Ontario, near Campbellville.Vorres, pp. 196‚Äì198 By 1952, the farm had become a burden to Olga and her husband. They were both elderly; their sons had moved away; labour was hard to come by; the Colonel suffered increasing ill-health, and some of Olga's remaining jewelry was stolen.Vorres, pp. 207‚Äì208 The farm was sold, and Olga, her husband and her former maid, Mimka, moved to a smaller five-room house at 2130 Camilla Road, Cooksville, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto now amalgamated into Mississauga.Phenix, pp. 205‚Äì206; Vorres, p. 209 Mimka suffered a stroke that left her disabled, and Olga nursed her until Mimka's death on 24 January 1954.Phenix, p. 207; Vorres, p. 210 Neighbours and visitors to the region, including foreign and royal dignitaries, took interest in Olga, and visited her home; these included Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, in 1954,Phenix, p. 214; Vorres, p. 211 and Louis Mountbatten and his wife Edwina, in August 1959.Vorres, p. 221 In June 1959, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip visited Toronto and invited the Grand Duchess for lunch on board the royal yacht Britannia.Phenix, pp. 238‚Äì239; Vorres, p. 207 Her home was also a magnet for Romanov impostors, whom Olga and her family considered a menace.Vorres, pp. 200‚Äì205 By 1958, Olga's husband was virtually paralyzed, and she sold some of her remaining jewelry to raise funds.Vorres, p. 219 Following her husband's death in 1958, she became increasingly infirm until hospitalized in April 1960 at Toronto General Hospital.Phenix, pp. 240‚Äì242; Vorres, p. 224 She was not informedVorres, p. 225 or was not awarePhenix, p. 242 that her elder sister, Xenia, died in London that month. Unable to care for herself, Olga went to stay with Russian √©migr√© friends, Konstantin and Sinaida Martemianoff, in an apartment above a beauty salon at 716 Gerrard Street East, Toronto.Phenix, p. 243; Vorres, p. 226 She slipped into a coma on 21 November 1960, and died on 24 November at the age of 78.Vorres, p. 227 She was interred next to her husband in York Cemetery, Toronto, on 30 November 1960, after a funeral service at Christ the Saviour Cathedral, Toronto.

A principal scientist on the USGS monitoring team, Johnston was killed in the eruption while manning an observation post away on the morning of May 18, 1980. He was the first to report the eruption, transmitting \\"Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!\\" before he was swept away by a lateral blast. Despite a thorough search, Johnston's body was never found, but state highway workers discovered remnants of his USGS trailer in 1993. Johnston's career took him across the United States, where he studied the Augustine Volcano in Alaska, the San Juan volcanic field in Colorado, and long-extinct volcanoes in Michigan. Johnston was a meticulous and talented scientist, known for his analyses of volcanic gases and their relationship to eruptions. This, along with his enthusiasm and positive attitude, made him liked and respected by many co-workers. After his death, other scientists lauded his character, both verbally and in dedications and letters. Johnston felt scientists must do what is necessary, including taking risks, to help protect the public from natural disasters. His work, and that of fellow USGS scientists, convinced authorities to close Mount St. Helens to the public before the 1980 eruption. They maintained the closure despite heavy pressure to re-open the area; their work saved thousands of lives. His story became intertwined with the popular image of volcanic eruptions and their threat to society, and a part of volcanology's history. To date, Johnston, along with Harry Glicken, is one of two American volcanologists known to have died in a volcanic eruption. Following his death, Johnston was commemorated in several ways, including a memorial fund established in his name at the University of Washington to fund graduate-level research. Two volcano observatories were established and named after him: one in Vancouver, Washington, and another on the ridge where he died. Johnston's life and death are featured in several documentaries, films, docudramas and books. The most recent is the biography of his life, authorized by his family, and an effort to overshadow inaccurate depictions of Johnston. Informed by his mentors, thesis advisor, friends, ex-colleagues, as well as his own writings, A Hero on Mount St. Helens: The Life and Legacy of David A. Johnston, was released by University of Illinois Press on May 18, 2019. The author is Melanie Holmes.

Photographed on April 4, 1980.|alt=Black and white photograph; a man squints into the telescopic eyepiece of a large mechanical device. Johnston was born at the University of Chicago Hospital on December 18, 1949, to Thomas and Alice Johnston. They originally lived in Hometown, Illinois, but moved to Oak Lawn shortly after Johnston's birth, where he grew to adulthood. Johnston grew up with one sister. His father worked as an engineer at a local company and his mother as a newspaper editor. Johnston often took photographs for his mother's newspaper and contributed articles to his school's newspaper. He never married. After graduating from Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn, Johnston attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He planned to study journalism, but became intrigued by an introductory geology class, and changed his major. His first geologic project was a study of the Precambrian rock that forms Michigan's Upper Peninsula. There he investigated the remains of an ancient volcano: a suite of metamorphosed basalts, a gabbroic sill, and volcanic roots in the form of a dioritic and gabbroic intrusion. The experience planted the seed of Johnston's passion for volcanoes. After working hard to learn the subject, he graduated with \\"Highest Honors and Distinction\\" in 1971. Johnston spent the summer after college in the San Juan volcanic field of Colorado working with volcanologist Pete Lipman in his study of two extinct calderas. This work became the inspiration for the first phase of his graduate work at the University of Washington in Seattle, in which he focused on the Oligocene Cimarron andesitic volcanic complex in the western San Juans. Johnston's reconstruction of the eruptive history of the extinct volcanoes prepared him to study active volcanoes. Johnston's first experience with active volcanoes was a geophysical survey of Mount Augustine in Alaska in 1975. When Mount Augustine erupted in 1976, Johnston raced back to Alaska, shunting his former work on the Cimmaron Volcano into a master's thesis, and making Mount Augustine the focus of his Ph.D. work. He graduated in 1978 with his Ph.D., having shown that (1) the emplacement mechanism of the pyroclastic flows had changed over time, as they became less pumaceous, (2) the magmas contained high quantities of volatile water, chlorine, and sulfur, and (3) underground mixing of the felsic (silicic) magmas with less-viscous mafic (basaltic) magmas could have triggered eruptions. Mount Augustine was also the site of an early near-disaster for Johnston, when he became trapped on Augustine Island as the volcano was building toward another eruption. During the summers of 1978 and 1979, Johnston led studies of the ash-flow sheet emplaced in the 1912 eruption of Mount Katmai in the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes. The gas phase is extremely important in propelling volcanic eruptions. Because of this, Johnston mastered the many techniques required to analyze glass-vapor inclusions in phenocrysts embedded in lavas, which provide information about gases present during past eruptions. His work at Mount Katmai and other volcanoes in the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes paved the way for his career, and his \\"agility, nerve, patience, and determination around the jet-like summit fumaroles in the crater of Mt. Mageik\\" impressed his colleagues. Later in 1978, Johnston joined the United States Geological Survey (USGS), where he monitored volcanic emission levels in the Cascades and Aleutian Arc. There he helped to strengthen the theory that eruptions can be predicted, to some degree, by changes in the makeup of volcanic gases. Fellow volcanologist Wes Hildreth said of Johnston, \\"I think Dave's dearest hope was that systematic monitoring of fumarolic emissions might permit detection of changes characteristically precursory to eruptions ... Dave wanted to formulate a general model for the behavior of magmatic volatiles prior to explosive outbursts and to develop a corollary rationale for the evaluation of hazards.\\" During this time, Johnston continued to visit Mount Augustine every summer and also assessed the geothermal energy potential of the Azores and Portugal. In the last year of his life, Johnston developed an interest in the health, agricultural, and environmental effects of both volcanic and anthropogenic emissions to the atmosphere. Johnston was based at the branch of the USGS in Menlo Park, California, but his work on volcanoes took him all over the Pacific Northwest region. When the first earthquakes shook Mount St. Helens on March 16, 1980, Johnston was nearby at the University of Washington, where he had pursued his doctorate. Intrigued by the possible advent of an eruption, Johnston contacted Stephen Malone, a professor of geology at the university. Malone had been his mentor when Johnston had worked at the San Juan complex in Colorado, and Johnston admired his work. Malone stated that he \\"put him to work\\" almost instantly, allowing Johnston to escort interested reporters to a place near the volcano.Hill, p. 33. Johnston was the first geologist on the volcano, and soon became a leader within the USGS team, taking charge of monitoring of volcanic gas emissions.  Eruption  = Precursor activity = alt=A man carefully walks down a steep sloping crater wall towards a lake at the bottom of the crater. Johnston sampling the lake. Since its last eruptive activity in 1857, Mount St. Helens had been largely dormant. Seismographs were not installed until 1972. This period of 123 years of inactivity ended in early 1980. On March 15, a cluster of tiny earthquakes rocked the area around the mountain. For six days, more than 100 earthquakes clustered around Mount St. Helens, an indication that magma was moving. There was initially some doubt as to whether the earthquakes were precursors to an eruption. By March 20, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake shook the wilderness around the volcano. The next day, seismologists installed three seismic recorder stations. By March 24, volcanologists at the USGS‚Äîincluding Johnston‚Äîbecame more confident that the seismic activity was a sign of an impending eruption. After March 25, seismic activity drastically increased. By March 26, more than seven earthquakes over magnitude 4.0 had been recorded, and the next day, hazard warnings were publicly issued. On March 27, a phreatic eruption took place, ejecting a plume of ash nearly into the air. Similar activity continued at the volcano over the following weeks, excavating the crater, forming an adjacent caldera, and erupting small amounts of steam, ash, and tephra. With each new eruption, the plumes of steam and ash from the volcano rose, eventually climbing to . By late March, the volcano was erupting up to 100 times per day.Bryson, p. 220. Spectators congregated in the vicinity of the mountain, hoping for a chance to see its eruptions. They were joined by reporters on helicopters, as well as mountain climbers. On April 17, a bulge (or \\"cryptodome\\") was discovered on the mountain's north flank, suggesting that Mount St. Helens could produce a lateral blast.Fisher, p. 91. Rising magma under Mount St. Helens had veered off to the north flank, creating a growing bulge on the surface. = Final signs and primary blast = Given the increasing seismic and volcanic activity, Johnston and the other volcanologists working for the USGS in its Vancouver branch prepared to observe any impending eruption. Geologist Don Swanson and others placed reflectors on and around the growing domes,Parchman, pp. 108‚Äì109. and established the Coldwater I and II observation posts to use laser ranging to measure how the distances to these reflectors changed over time as the domes deformed. Coldwater II, where Johnston died, was located just north of the mountain. To the astonishment of the USGS geologists, the bulge was growing at a rate of 5 to 8 feet (1.5 to 2.4 meters) per day. this picture.|alt=A man climbing a steep cliff face dwarfed by massive boulders around him. Tiltmeters installed on the volcano's north side displayed a northwest trending tilt for that side of the mountain, and a southwest trending tilt was observed on the south side. Worried that the amount of pressure on the magma underground was increasing, scientists analyzed gases by the crater, and found high traces of sulfur dioxide. After this discovery, they began to regularly check the fumarolic activity and monitor the volcano for dramatic changes, but none were observed. Disheartened, they instead opted to study the growing bulge and the threat an avalanche could have for humans relatively near the volcano. An evaluation of the threat was carried out, concluding that a landslide or avalanche in the Toutle River could spawn lahars, or mudflows, downstream. At that point, the previously consistent phreatic activity had become intermittent. Between May 10 and May 17, the only change occurred on the volcano's north flank, as the bulge increased in size. On May 16 and 17, the mountain stopped its phreatic eruptions completely. alt=Large volcanic mountain deformed by large cracks and bulges on its slopes, seen from a ridge across a thickly forested valley. A summit crater is partially seen. approximately 60 others, devastating the landscape.|alt=The same volcano and landscape as in the previous picture. Much of the mountain is missing, replaced by an enormous caldera (volcanic crater). The previously forested landscape is now barren as the trees were destroyed in the volcanic blast. The active Mount St. Helens was radically different from its dormant form, now featuring an enormous bulge and several craters. In the week preceding the eruption, cracks formed in the north sector of the volcano's summit, indicating a movement of magma. At 8:32 a.m. local time the next day (18 May), an earthquake measuring magnitude 5.1 rocked the area, triggering the landslide that started the main eruption. In a matter of seconds, vibrations from the earthquake loosened of rock on the mountain's north face and summit, creating a massive landslide. With the loss of the confining pressure of the overlying rock, Mount St. Helens began to rapidly emit steam and other volcanic gases. A few seconds later, it erupted laterally, sending swift pyroclastic flows down its flanks at near supersonic speeds. These flows were later joined by lahars. Before being struck by a series of flows that, at their fastest, would have taken less than a minute to reach his position, Johnston managed to radio his USGS co-workers with the message: \\"Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!\\" Seconds later, the signal from the radio went silent, and all contact with the geologist was lost. Initially, there was some debate as to whether Johnston had survived; records soon showed a radio message from fellow eruption victim and amateur radio operator Gerry Martin, located near the Coldwater peak and farther north of Johnston's position, reporting his sighting of the eruption enveloping the Coldwater II observation post. As the blast overwhelmed Johnston's post, Martin declared solemnly that the camp and car sitting to his south were covered: \\"It's gonna get me, too,\\" he said before his radio went silent. The extent, speed and direction of the avalanche and pyroclastic flows that overwhelmed Johnston, Martin, and others were later described in detail in a paper titled 'Chronology and Character of the 18 May 1980 Explosive Eruptions of Mount St. Helens', published in 1984 in a collection published by the National Research Council's Geophysics Study Committee. In this paper, the authors examined photographs and satellite images of the eruption to construct a chronology and description of the first few minutes. Included in the paper is figure 10.3, a series of timed photographs taken from Mount Adams, east of Mount St. Helens. These six photographs, taken sideways on to the lateral blast, vividly show the extent and size of the avalanche and flows as they reached northwards over and beyond Johnston's position. Figure 10.7 from the same paper is an overhead diagram showing the position of the pyroclastic surge front at half-minute intervals, with the positions of Johnston (Coldwater II) and Martin included. The eruption was heard hundreds of miles away, but some of those who survived the eruption declared that the landslide and pyroclastic flows were silent as they raced down the mountain. Kran Kilpatrick, an employee of the United States Forest Service, recalled, \\"There was no sound to it, not a sound. It was like a silent movie and we were all in it.\\"Sandler, p. 91. The reason for this discrepancy is a \\"quiet zone\\", created as a result of the motion and temperature of air and, to a lesser extent, upon local topography. Famous for telling reporters that being on the mountain was like \\"standing next to a dynamite keg and the fuse is lit\\", Johnston had been among the first volcanologists at the volcano when eruptive signs appeared, and shortly after was named the head of volcanic gas monitoring. He and several other volcanologists prevented people from being near the volcano during the few months of pre-eruptive activity, and successfully fought pressure to re-open the area. Their work kept the death toll at a few tens of individuals, instead of the thousands who possibly could have been killed had the region not been sealed off. = USGS team and rescue efforts = alt=Satellite image of the area surrounding Mount St. Helens, labeled with various locations. The primary locations marked are: Mount St. Helens (in the center of the volcano there is a circular black crater); and to the north of the volcano the Coldwater II observation post, where Johnston was camped. The other locations marked are three lakes (Spirit Lake, Bear Cove, and Coldwater lake) and a river (North Fork Toutle River). Many USGS scientists worked on the team monitoring the volcano, but it was graduate student Harry Glicken who had been manning the Coldwater II observation post for the two and a half weeks immediately preceding the eruption.Parchman, p. 46. The evening before the eruption he was scheduled to be relieved by USGS geologist Don Swanson, but something came up, and Swanson asked Johnston to take his place. Johnston agreed. That Saturday, the day before the eruption took place, Johnston ascended the mountain and went on a patrol of the volcano with geologist Carolyn Driedger. Tremors shook the mountain. Driedger was supposed to camp on one of the ridges overlooking the volcano that night, but Johnston told her to head home and said that he would stay on the volcano alone. While at Coldwater II, Johnston was to observe the volcano for any further signs of an eruption.Harris, p. 205. Just prior to his departure, at 7 p.m. on the evening of May 17, 13¬Ω hours before the eruption, Glicken took the famous photograph of Johnston sitting by the observation-post trailer with a notebook on his lap, smiling. The following morning, May 18, at , the volcano erupted. Immediately, rescue workers were dispatched to the area. The official USGS pilot, Lon Stickney, who had been flying the scientists to the mountain, conducted the first rescue attempt. He flew his helicopter over the scarred remains of trees, valleys, and the Coldwater II observation post ridge, where he saw bare rock and uprooted trees. Because he saw no sign of Johnston's trailer, Stickney began to panic, becoming \\"emotionally distraught\\". Frantic and guilt-stricken, Harry Glicken convinced three separate helicopter pilots to take him up on flights over the devastated area in a rescue attempt, but the eruption had so changed the landscape that they were unable to locate any sign of the Coldwater II observation post. In 1993, while building a extension of Washington State Route 504 (also called \\"Spirit Lake Memorial Highway\\") to lead to the Johnston Ridge Observatory, construction workers discovered pieces of Johnston's trailer. His body, however, has never been recovered. = Consequences and response = The public was shocked by the extent of the eruption, which had lowered the elevation of the summit by , destroyed of woodland, and spread ash into other states and Canada. The lateral blast that killed Johnston started at a speed of and accelerated to . Even USGS scientists were awed. With a Volcanic Explosivity Index value of 5, the eruption was catastrophic. More than 50 people were killed or missing, including Johnston, mountain resident Harry R. Truman, photographer Robert Landsburg, and National Geographic photographer Reid Blackburn. The disaster was the deadliest and most destructive volcanic eruption in the history of the United States of America. A total of 57 people are known to have died, and more were left homeless when the ash falls and pyroclastic flows destroyed or buried 200 houses. In addition to the human fatalities, thousands of animals perished. The official estimate from the USGS was 7,000 game animals, salmon fingerlings, and 40,000 salmon. Two years after the eruption, the United States government set aside of land for the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. This protected area, which includes the Johnston Ridge Observatory and several other research and visitor centers, serves as an area for scientific research, tourism, and education.  Legacy  =Scientific= Johnston, known to his friends as Dave, was commemorated by both his fellow scientists and by the government. Known for his diligent and particular nature, he was called \\"an exemplary scientist\\" by a USGS dedication paper, which also described him as \\"unaffectedly genuine, with an infectious curiosity and enthusiasm\\". He was quick to \\"dissipate cynicism\\" and believed that \\"careful evaluation and interpretation\\" was the best approach to his work. An obituary notice for Johnston stated that at the time of his death he had been \\"among the leading young volcanologists in the world\\" and that his \\"enthusiasm and warmth\\" would be \\"missed at least as much as his scientific strength\\". Following the eruption, Harry Glicken and other geologists at the USGS dedicated their work to Johnston.Parchman, p. 142. Because Johnston was believed to be safe at the Coldwater II observation post, the fact that he died shocked his friends and co-workers alike. However, most of his colleagues and family asserted that Johnston died \\"doing what he wanted to do.\\" His mother stated in an interview shortly after the eruption, \\"Not many people get to do what they really want to do in this world, but our son did. ... He would tell us he may never get rich but he was doing what he wanted. He wanted to be near if the eruption came. In a phone call on Mother's Day, he told us it's a sight very few geologists get to see.\\" Dr. Stephen Malone agreed that Johnston died doing what he loved, and stated that he \\"was very good at his work\\". Johnston's role in the study of the volcano in the weeks leading up to the eruption was acknowledged in 1981 in a chronology of the eruption, published as part of the USGS report titled 'The 1980 Eruptions of Mount St. Helens, Washington': alt=Surrounding a curved building with glass windows is a landscape of snow. Since Johnston's death, his field of volcanic eruption prediction has advanced significantly, and volcanologists are now able to predict eruptions based on a number of precursors that become apparent between days and months in advance. Geologists can now identify characteristic patterns in seismic waves that indicate particular magmatic activity. In particular, volcanologists have used deep, long-period earthquakes that indicate that magma is rising through the crust. They can also use carbon dioxide emission as a proxy for magma supply rate. Measurements of surface deformation due to magmatic intrusions, like those that were conducted by Johnston and the other USGS scientists at the Coldwater I and II outposts, have advanced in scale and precision. Ground deformation monitoring networks around volcanoes now consist of InSAR (interferometry), surveys of networks of GPS monuments, microgravity surveys in which scientists measure the change in gravitational potential or acceleration because of the intruding magma and resulting deformation, strain meters, and tiltmeters. Though there is still work to be done, this combination of approaches has greatly improved scientists' abilities to forecast volcanic eruptions. In addition to his work, Johnston himself has become part of the history of volcanic eruptions. With Harry Glicken, he is one of two volcanologists from the United States to die in a volcanic eruption.Lopes, p. 43. Glicken was being mentored by Johnston, who relieved Glicken of his watch at the Coldwater II observation post 13 hours before Mount St. Helens erupted. Glicken died in 1991, eleven years later, when a pyroclastic flow overran him and several others at Mount Unzen in Japan. =Commemoration= alt=Refer to caption. Early acts of commemoration included two trees that were planted in Tel Aviv, Israel, and the renaming of a community center in Johnston's hometown as the \\"Johnston Center\\". These actions were reported in newspapers during the first anniversary of the eruption in May 1981. On the second anniversary of the eruption, the USGS office in Vancouver (which had been permanently established following the 1980 eruption) was renamed the David A. Johnston Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) in his memory. This volcano observatory is the one most responsible for monitoring Mount St. Helens, and helped to predict all of the volcano's eruptions between 1980 and 1985. In a 2005 open day, the lobby area of the CVO included a display and painting commemorating Johnston. Johnston's connections with the University of Washington (where he had carried out his masters and doctoral research) are remembered by a memorial fund that established an endowed graduate-level fellowship within what is now the department of Earth and Space Sciences. By the time of the first anniversary of his death, the fund had exceeded $30,000. Known as the 'David A. Johnston Memorial Fellowship for Research Excellence', a number of awards of this fellowship have been made over the years since it was launched. Following the eruption, the area where the Coldwater II observation post had been was sectioned off. Eventually, an observatory was built in the area in Johnston's name, and opened in 1997. Located just over from the north flank of Mount St. Helens, the Johnston Ridge Observatory (JRO) allows the public to admire the open crater, new activity, and the creations of the 1980 eruption, including an extensive basalt field. Part of the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, the JRO was constructed for , equipped with monitoring equipment. Visited by thousands of tourists annually, it also includes tours, a theater, and an exhibit hall. There are several public memorials where Johnston's name is inscribed in a list of those known to have died in the eruption. These memorials include a large curved granite monument at an outside viewing area at the Johnston Ridge Observatory, which opened in 1997, and a plaque at the Hoffstadt Bluffs Visitor Center, which was unveiled in a memorial grove in May 2000. =Depictions= alt=Refer to caption. There have been several tellings of Johnston's story in documentaries, films and docudramas about the eruption. The only telling of his story authorized and informed by a combination of his family, close friends, mentors, colleagues, and his own writings is in the book released by the University of Illinois Press in conjunction with the 39th anniversary of the eruption, on May 18, 2019: A Hero on Mount St. Helens; The Life and Legacy of David A. Johnston, by Melanie Holmes. In the 1981 HBO television film St. Helens, actor David Huffman starred as David Jackson, a fictional character supposedly based on Johnston, but with almost no representation of his actions in 1980. Johnston's parents objected to the production of the film, arguing that it possessed not \\"an ounce of David in it\\" and portrayed \\"him as a daredevil rather than a careful scientist\\". Johnston's mother stated that the film had changed many true aspects of the eruption, and depicted her son as \\"a rebel\\" with \\"a history of disciplinary trouble\\". Prior to the film's premiere on May 18, 1981, the first anniversary of the eruption, 36 scientists who knew Johnston signed a letter of protest. They wrote that, \\"Dave's life was too meritorious to require fictional embellishments,\\" and that, \\"Dave was a superbly conscientious and creative scientist.\\"Parchman, p. 206. Several documentaries and docudramas have covered the history of the eruption, including archive footage and dramatisations of Johnston's story. These include Up From the Ashes (1990) by KOMO-TV, an episode of the 2005 second series of Seconds From Disaster broadcast by the National Geographic Channel, an episode of the 2006 series Surviving Disaster made by the BBC, and the episode \\"Rescued From Mount St. Helens\\" from the 2017 series We'll Meet Again with Ann Curry on PBS.

A flotilla is usually composed of a homogeneous group of the same class of warship, such as frigates, destroyers, torpedo boats, submarines, gunboats, or minesweepers. Groups of larger warships are usually called squadrons, but similar units of non-capital ships may be called squadrons in some instances, and flotillas in others. Formations including more than one capital ship, e.g. men-of-war, battleships, and aircraft carriers, typically alongside smaller ships and support craft, are typically called fleets, each portion led by a capital ship being a squadron or task force (see reference below). A flotilla is usually commanded by a rear admiral, a commodore or a captain, depending on the importance of the command (a vice admiral would normally command a squadron). A flotilla is often divided into two or more divisions, each of which might be commanded by the most senior commander, nearly always a lieutenant at the very least. A flotilla is often, but not necessarily, a permanent formation. In modern navies, flotillas have tended to become administrative units containing several squadrons.\\"military unit.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2010. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 16 Oct. 2010 : \\"Administratively, several ships of the same type (e.g., destroyers) are organized into a squadron. Several squadrons in turn form a flotilla, several of which in turn form a fleet. For operations, however, many navies organize their vessels into task units (3‚Äì5 ships), task or battle groups (4‚Äì10 ships), task forces (2‚Äì5 task groups), and fleets (several task forces).\\" As warships have grown larger, the term squadron has gradually replaced the term flotilla for formations of destroyers, frigates and submarines in many navies. A naval flotilla has no direct equivalent on land, but is, perhaps, the rough equivalent in tactical value of a brigade or regiment.  US Coast Guard  In the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, a Flotilla is the basic organizational unit and consists of members at a local level where the majority of the work of the Auxiliary is done. A Flotilla is led by an elected Flotilla Commander assisted by an elected Vice Flotilla Commander, who is in turn assisted by appointed Flotilla Staff Officers.As described at the Flotilla Organization page of the U.S. Coast Guard. A Coast Guard Auxiliary Division consists of multiple Flotillas and a District consists of multiple Divisions. Auxiliary Districts are organized along Coast Guard District lines and are administered by a Coast Guard officer (usually a Commander or Captain) who is called the Director of the Auxiliary.  Russian Navy  In the Russian Navy, the word flotilla has tended to be used for \\"brown-water\\" naval units ‚Äì those operating not on the oceans and real seas, but on inland seas or rivers. Among the former are the present-day Caspian Flotilla, the early 20th century Satakundskaya Flotilla, or the Aral Flotilla of the 1850s;Ram Rahul. \\"March of Central Asia\\". Published 2000.

On Google Books among the latter, the Don Military Flotilla (which was created several times over more than 200 years), the Dnieper Flotilla (also extant in the 18th and 20th centuries), the Red Volga Flotilla, which participated in the Kazan Operation during the Russian Civil War, and the Danube Flotilla. In the 18th century, the term also applied to the comparatively small fleets operating on those seas where Russia did not have much naval presence yet, e.g. the Okhotsk Flotilla. Non-military usage The word flotilla has also been used at times to refer to a small fleet of vessels, commercial or otherwise. There is also such thing as a flotilla holiday, in which is a group of chartered yachts that set sail together on the same route.

Reilly. Written by playwright Dennis McIntyre, the film was executive-produced by Ned Dowd, Randy Ostrow, and Ron Rotholz, with a musical score by Ennio Morricone. Although the film was not a box office success and its release overshadowed by that of the similarly- themed Goodfellas, it was received positively by most critics. Shot on location in New York City, the film was inspired by the real-life Hell's Kitchen gang the Westies. Coincidentally, Penn was strongly considered for the lead role of Henry Hill in Goodfellas before he starred in this film. Plot Irish-American Terry Noonan returns to Hell's Kitchen in New York City after a long absence, where his unpredictable childhood friend Jackie Flannery is involved in an Irish crime organization run by older brother Frank. Terry rekindles an old relationship with Jackie's sister Kathleen. Terry is actually an undercover cop, and confesses it to Kathleen. She is reluctant to have anything to do with him after being told by her brother Frank that Terry is now a member of his gang after killing two people, although Terry explains to Kathleen the killing was staged by his police boss Nick, with blanks used. Jackie is drinking in a bar one night when three members of a rival Italian gang enter. Suspecting their involvement in the killing of his friend, Stevie, Jackie snaps and ends up killing all three for intruding on his gang's territory. Frank is summoned to a meeting with Italian Mafia boss Joe Borelli and is told he must kill his brother Jackie. Frank has told his men to lie in wait in case the meeting goes wrong, and manages to avert a shoot out by hugging the Italian leader outside the restaurant in full view of the gang, causing them to retreat. Frank arranges for Jackie to collect $25,000 after lying to him that the Italians are actually supporting them and that this is their reward, telling him to go to Battery Park. Terry tags along as Jackie's secret backup, finding that the location has been changed to Pier 84. As they wait at Pier 84, Frank arrives with his enforcer Pat Nicholson just as Terry has stepped away to frantically phone his police handlers to inform them that they have been sent to the wrong location. Frank shoots Jackie in cold blood. The police finally arrive and Terry tells Nick that he is quitting as an undercover operative. At Jackie's funeral, Terry reveals to Frank that he was at Pier 84, and also hands him his police badge. Hours later, while Kathleen is watching the St. Patrick's Day parade alone, Terry goes to the bar where Frank and his gang are. In a shootout, Frank and all of his men are killed. Having been shot three times, Terry slumps to the floor.

He is successful much of the time here.\\" Maslin praised Oldman and Harris, writing, \\"Jackie Flannery is played by the phenomenal Gary Oldman, who since Sid and Nancy has taken on a string of new accents and dramatic identities with stunning ease\\", and \\"Jackie's icy older brother ... is played by Ed Harris with an eeriness to match Mr. Oldman's.\\"Maslin, Janet. The New York Times, film review, September 14, 1990. Critic Vincent Leo praised Penn's performance, noting, \\"While Oldman gets the accolades for his energetic performance, it is really Penn's inner demons that provides the film with the right amount of conflict, always letting us be aware that fine lines are the difference between life and death, as well as right and wrong, out in the streets of New York. Is Penn doing the noble thing by taking down the criminals, or is he a rat bastard, disowning himself from the way of life and people who helped him along the way? It's the question that makes him sick to the pit of his stomach, and Penn shows it in his face with almost every scene.\\"Leo, Vincent. Qwipster, film review. Roger Ebert, film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times, felt the film begins as \\"original and challenging\\" but then \\"turns into a story filled with familiar elements\\". He nevertheless awarded it three stars out of four and had particular praise for the work of Gary Oldman, writing: \\"Oldman's performance in the movie is the best thing about it...What's best about State of Grace is what's unique to it - the twisted vision of the Oldman character, who lives in a world of evil and betrayal and has somehow thought himself around to the notion that he is doing the right thing.\\" State of Grace has been recognized as a cult classic. Soundtrack The original soundtrack was released on October 1, 1990, by MCA. The CD has eighteen tracks, is 53:45 in length, and features a score composed, orchestrated and conducted by Ennio Morricone.

The unit was quickly adopted into the British army as an independent ranger company. Robert Rogers trained and commanded the rapidly deployed light infantry force, which was tasked mainly with reconnaissance as well as conducting special operations against distant targets. Their tactics were built on earlier colonial precedents and were codified for the first time by Rogers as his 28 \\"Rules of Ranging\\" The tactics proved remarkably effective, so much so that the initial company was expanded into a ranging corps of more than a dozen companies (containing as many as 1,200‚Äì1,400 men at its peak). The ranger corps became the chief scouting arm of British Crown forces by the late 1750s. The British forces in America valued Rogers' Rangers for their ability to gather intelligence about the enemy. They were disbanded in 1761. Later, the company was revived as a Loyalist force during the American Revolutionary War. Nonetheless, a number of former ranger officers defected to fight for the Continental Army as Rebel (Patriot) commanders. Some ex-rangers participated as Rebel (Patriot) militiamen at the Battle of Concord Bridge. The Queen's York Rangers (1st American Regiment) of the Canadian Army, formed by Rogers and Loyalist veterans of Rogers' Rangers, claims descent from Rogers' Rangers. Regimental history =French and Indian War= Rogers' Rangers began in 1755 as a company in the provincial forces of the colony of New Hampshire in British North America. It was the latest in a long line of New England ranger companies dating back to the 1670s. The immediate precursor and model for the unit was Gorham's Rangers, formed in 1744. Both were initially organized by William Shirley. Gorham's Rangers are always depicted as precursors of Rogers' Rangers; however, they were also active throughout the French and Indian War, which makes them contemporaries of Rogers' Rangers. In fact, the Nova Scotia ranger corps that Gorham's company belonged to operated in cooperation with units of Rogers' corps on several occasions, most notably when Moses Hazen's company joined Rogers' Rangers at the Siege of Louisburg in 1758 and the Siege of Quebec in 1759.Brian D. Carroll, \\"'Savages' in the Service of Empire: Native American Soldiers in Gorham's Rangers,\\" New England Quarterly 85, no. 3 (Sept. 2012): 383-429. Rogers' company was formed to fight in the French and Indian War (the Seven Years' War in Canada, Britain, and Europe) in the borderlands of the colonial Northeast. They were commanded by Captain (later Major) Robert Rogers and operated primarily in the Lake George and Lake Champlain regions of New York. The unit was formed during the winter of 1755 from forces stationed at Fort William Henry. The Rangers sometimes undertook raids against French towns and military emplacements, traveling on foot, in whaleboats, and even on snowshoes during winter. Israel Putnam (who would go on to later fame in the Revolutionary War) fought as a Connecticut militia captain in conjunction with Rogers, and at one point saved his life.Hubbard, Robert Ernest. Major General Israel Putnam: Hero of the American Revolution, pp. 77-8, McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson, North Carolina, 2017. . Robert Rogers, the founding leader and namesake of Rogers' Rangers, in a 1776 painting, the only known portrait from life of Rogers. The usefulness of Rogers' company during 1756 and 1757 prompted the British to form a second ranger company, which was soon followed by more. By early 1758, the rangers had been expanded to a corps of fourteen companies composed of between 1,200 and 1,400 men. This included three all-Indian units, two of Stockbridge Mahicans and one of Indians from Connecticut (mainly Mohegan and Pequot). Rogers was then promoted to major and served as commandant of the Ranger Corps. First Battle on Snowshoes On January 21, 1757, during the First Battle on Snowshoes, Rogers led 74 rangers to ambush the French, capturing seven prisoners near Fort Carillon at the south end of Lake Champlain. They then were attacked by about 100 French and Canadien (French Canadian) militia and their Ottawa allies from the Ohio Country. Rogers' men suffered casualties and retreated without further losses, since the French lacked snowshoes and were \\"floundering in snow up to their knees.\\"Louis Antoine de Bougainville, Adventures in the Wilderness; Edward P. Hamilton, ed. and trans. (Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 1964) Rogers' Rangers had maintained positions on the high ground and behind large trees. According to Francis Parkman, Ranger casualties were 14 killed, 6 captured, and 6 wounded, the wounded returning with 48 men who were unharmed. The French consisted of 89 Regulars and 90 Canadians and Indians; they had 37 killed and wounded.Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, Vol. 1, Little Brown & Co., 1922, pp. 458-459, available on Googlebooks The French and Indian casualties may have included one of the captured prisoners. One wounded and captured Ranger who was later exchanged claimed to have killed one of the captured Frenchmen by striking him on the head with a tomahawk after the Rangers were ambushed. It is unclear if this was the fate of the other captured French, as well. A company of the rangers led by Noah Johnson was stationed at Fort William Henry in 1757 during the siege. The siege ended with the surrender of the British forces and a massacre in August. After this, the Rangers were stationed on Rogers Island near Fort Edward. This allowed them to train and operate with more freedom than the regular forces. Second Battle on Snowshoes On March 13, 1758 at the Second Battle on Snowshoes, Rogers' Rangers ambushed a French-Indian column and were then ambushed in turn by enemy forces. The Rangers lost 125 men in this encounter, as well as eight men wounded, with 52 surviving. One reference reports casualties of the Regulars, who had volunteered to accompany the Rangers, as 2 captured and 5 killed. Of Rogers' Rangers, 78 were captured and 47 killed and missing (of whom 19 were captured).Mary Cochrane Rogers, \\"Battle of the Snowshoes\\" Rogers estimated 100 killed and nearly 100 wounded of the French-Indian forces. The French, however, reported their casualties as just 10 Indians killed and 17 wounded, and three Canadians wounded.New York State, \\"The Battle on Snowshoes\\", March 1758 The French originally reported killing Rogers in the second battle. This was based on their finding some of his belongings, including his regimental coat containing his military commission; however, he had escaped. This episode gave rise to the legend of Rogers' sliding down the side of a mountain to the frozen surface of Lake George. There is no conclusive proof this actually happened, but the rock face is still known as \\"Rogers' Slide\\" or \\"Rogers Rock\\".Lake George Historical Association - Roger's Slide Siege of Louisbourg Four companies of Rogers Rangers (500 rangers) arrived on the provincial vessel King George and were at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia from April 8 until May 28, awaiting the Siege of Louisbourg (1758). While there, they scoured the woods to stop raids on the capital. During the Siege, the rangers were the first to go ashore at Freshwater Cover and encountered 100 Mi'kmaq and French soldiers. James Wolfe and Scott followed up the rangers. The Rangers killed and scalped the Chief Mi'kmaq. In their retreat, the rangers captured 70 defenders and killed more than 50. Historian Burt Loescher describes this as \\"one of the most admirable feats ever performed by a detachment of the Corps.\\" Carillon and Crown Point On July 7‚Äì8, 1758, Rogers' Rangers took part in the Battle of Carillon. On July 27, 1758, between Fort Edwards and Half-Way Brook, 300 Indians and 200 French/Canadians under Captain St. Luc ambushed a British convoy. The British lost 116 killed (including 16 Rangers) and 60 captured.Indiana archives On August 8, 1758, near Crown Point, New York, a British force of Rangers, light infantry, and provincials was ambushed by a French-Canadian-Indian force of 450 under Captain Marin. In this action, Major Israel Putnam was captured. He was reportedly saved from burning at the stake by the Abenaki through the intervention of a French officer and a providential thunderstorm. Francis Parkman reported 49 British fatalities and \\"more than a hundred\\" killed of the enemy. Rogers claimed the British losses were 33 and that those of the enemy as 199. Another sourceIndiana Archives, p. 122 reports that the French casualties were four Indians and six Canadians killed, and four Indians and six Canadians wounded, including an officer and a cadet. Raid on Saint-Francis During 1759, the Rangers were involved in one of their most famous operations, the St. Francis Raid. They had been ordered to destroy the Abenaki settlement of Saint-Francis in Quebec. It was the base of the raids and attacks on British settlements. Rogers led a force of 200 Rangers from Crown Point deep into French territory. Following the October 3, 1759 attack and successful destruction of Saint-Francis, Rogers' force ran out of food on their retreat through the wilderness of northern New England. They reached a safe location along the Connecticut River at the abandoned Fort Wentworth, where Rogers left them encamped. He returned a few days later with food and relief forces from Fort at Number 4 (now Charlestown, New Hampshire), the nearest British outpost. In the raid on Saint-Francis, Rogers claimed 200 enemies had been killed, leaving 20 women and children to be taken prisoner; he took five children as captives and released the rest.\\"Francis Parkman\\".pp.266 The French recorded 30 deaths, including 20 women and children.Roger's Raid according to the research of Gordon Day According to Francis Parkman, Ranger casualties in the attack were one killed and six wounded; in the retreat, five were captured from one band of Rangers, and nearly all in another party of about 20 Rangers were killed or captured.\\"Francis Parkman\\".pp.266-267 One source alleges that only about 100 returned of about 204 Rangers, allies, and observers.Spring Camporee 2005 Montreal campaign In the Spring of 1760 the Rangers joined in Amherst's campaign on Montreal but before doing so conducted a successful preemptive raid on Fort Sainte Th√©r√®se which was used to supply the French army as well as being a vital link in the communication and supply line between Fort Saint-Jean and the French forces at √éle aux Noix. The settlement and fort were then burned by Rogers following which French and Indian ambushes were repelled before their return to Crown Point with only minor losses. Roger's Rangers were part of William Haviland's force who marched from Lake Ontario in the west along the St Lawrence River and from upper New York via the Richelieu River in August. Along the way the Rangers fought to reduce the fortified French island of √éle aux Noix. During the bombardment of the island Haviland sent Rogers' four ranger companies as well as light infantry and a force of Indians to drag three cannon through the forest and swamps further down to the rear of the French position. With much difficulty this was achieved and in a few days the guns were planted on the river-bank where a French naval force stood defending it. Rogers' cannon opened up upon the these vessels surprising them; the closest sloop cut her cable and a strong west wind then drove her ashore into the hands of the British. The other vessels and gunboats made all sail downstream but stranded in a bend of the river, where the rangers, swimming out with their tomahawks, boarded and took one of them, and the rest soon surrendered. With their communications cut the French evacuated the island which then fell to the British. Soon after the Forts of Saint Jean and Chambly were burned by the French; the Rangers then led the final advance on Montreal which surrendered without a fight the following month. =Pontiac's Rebellion= At the end of the war, the Rangers were given the task of taking command of Fort Detroit from the French forces. After the war, most of the Rangers returned to civilian life. In 1763, Rogers recruited several volunteers for the reinforcement of Detroit commanded by James Dalyell of the 1st Royal Regiment and formerly of the 80th Regiment of Light Armed Foot (Gage's Light Infantry). Upon arrival at Detroit, Dalyell talked post Commandant Henry Gladwin into allowing Dalyell to take his reinforcements to attack an Indian village near Parent's Creek. The force of 250-300 soldiers of the 55th and 60th regiments, Rogers' volunteers, and the Queen's Royal American Rangers under the command of Captain Joseph Hopkins was ambushed, as the advanced guard made up of men from the 55th regiment crossed the bridge at Parent's Creek. Rogers' men were responsible for effectively covering the retreat of the force back to Fort Detroit. =American War of Independence= When the American Revolution began in 1775, Robert Rogers offered his services to General George Washington. However, Washington turned him down, fearing he might be a spy, since Rogers had just returned from a long stay in England. Infuriated by the rejection, Rogers offered his services to the British, who accepted. He formed the Queen's Rangers (1776) and later the King's Rangers. Several of his former rangers served under General Benedict Arnold in the revolutionary forces around Lake Champlain.Randall, Willard Sterne (1990). Benedict Arnold: Patriot and Traitor. Legacy After the conclusion of what the British describe as the American War of Independence, Rogers Rangers were granted tracts of land for farming in what is now Pownal, Prince Edward Island, Canada. The Rangers were reactivated during the War of 1812 and a large training camp was built there, complete with barracks, a field hospital and musket range (of which the butts can still be seen). The Queen's York Rangers (1st American Regiment) of the Canadian Army claim to be descended from Rogers' Rangers. Also claiming descent from Rogers' Rangers are the 1st Battalion 119th Field Artillery of Michigan and the U.S. Army Rangers. Rogers' Rangers are featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 56) along New Hampshire Route 10 in Haverhill. In popular culture * Kenneth Roberts' historical novel Northwest Passage (1937) portrays the events of Rogers' Rangers' raid on the Abenaki town of St. Francis. The first half of the novel was adapted as the film Northwest Passage (1940). * During the Second World War, the U.S. Army was interested in the tactics of the British Commando units.

About Asawa, Opera News stated: \\"In his prime, Asawa was an electric performer, his fearless performing style supported by a voice of arresting beauty and expressivity.\\" Early life Brian Asawa was born in Fullerton, California, and grew up in Los Angeles. He sang in the choir at a Methodist church with a Japanese congregation. He began his studies as a piano major at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and then changed his studies to voice, studying under tenor Harlan Hokin. After two semesters there he transferred to UCLA. In 1989, he began a master's degree in early-music interpretation at the University of Southern California where he was a pupil of the American lutenist James Tyler. However, Asawa never finished this program as his performance career began to take off. Career His career was launched in 1991 when he became the first countertenor to win both the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions and an Adler Fellowship to the San Francisco Opera's Merola Opera Program. Of his performance at the Metropolitan Allan Kozinn wrote: Asawa made his professional opera debut at the San Francisco Opera in 1991 in Hans Werner Henze's Das verratene Meer where he also sang the Shepherd in Tosca and Oberon in Benjamin Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1992. While at the SFO he continued voice studies with Jane Randolph. He also made his first opera appearance in New York City in 1992 at the Mozart Bicentennial celebration at Lincoln Center, singing the title role in Mozart's Ascanio in Alba with the Mostly Mozart Festival Chorus and the New York Chamber Symphony under conductor √Åd√°m Fischer. In 1993, Asawa was awarded a career grant from the Richard Tucker Music Foundation and made his debut at the Santa Fe Opera as Arsamene in Handel's Xerxes. In The New York Times in January 1994 Alex Ross wrote: Later that year, Asawa became the first countertenor to win the Operalia International Opera Competition, and made debuts at the Metropolitan Opera as the Voice of Apollo in Benjamin Britten's Death in Venice and at Glimmerglass Opera as Ottone in Claudio Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea. He was chosen Seattle Opera's Artist of the Year for the 1996‚Äì97 season. Other career highlights included Orlofsky in Die Fledermaus at San Francisco Opera and San Diego Opera; Tolomeo in Giulio Cesare at Metropolitan Opera, Bordeaux, Opera Australia, Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, Paris Opera, Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona, and Hamburg State Opera; Arsamene in Serse at Los Angeles, Cologne, Seattle, and Geneva; the title role in Admeto at Sydney, Montpellier and Halle; Baba The Turk in The Rake's Progress at San Francisco and for Swedish television; Fyodor in Boris Godunov at the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Endimione in La Calisto in Brussels, Oberon in A Midsummer Night's Dream at San Francisco, Houston, London Symphony Orchestra and Lyon; Ascanio in Ascanio in Alba at Lincoln Center; Farnace in Mitridate, re di Ponto at Opera National de Lyon and Paris Opera; Nero in L'incoronazione di Poppea in Sydney; Orfeo in Orfeo ed Euridice, La Speranza in L'Orfeo and L'Umana Fragilita/Anfinomo in Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria at Netherlands Opera; David in Handel's Saul and Belize in the opera Angels in America by P√©ter E√∂tv√∂s at the Bavarian State Opera, and Sesto in Giulio Cesare at COC in Toronto. Asawa not only performed in opera, but was interested in expanding the art song literature for countertenor, supporting living composers by commissioning, performing, and recording works by them. Perhaps best known is the song cycle \\"Encountertenor\\", commissioned from Jake Heggie and premiered at London's Wigmore Hall in 1995 (later recording it for the RCA Red Seal label). Asawa also recorded a disc of songs by Ned Rorem with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra for RCA. More recently, Asawa sang San Francisco composer Kurt Erickson's \\"Four Arab Love Songs\\" (a mini-cycle of medieval Arab poems from Spain‚Äôs Andalusia region dating from 900 to 1100 AD) on a premiere tour consisting of concerts in Long Beach, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, California and in Washington State. At the time of his death, Asawa was slated to premiere the song cycle \\"O Mistress Mine\\" (12 songs on texts from the plays of Shakespeare) written for him by Connecticut composer Juliana Hall at the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival in celebration of the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death. In May 2014, Asawa performed a recital program with mezzo-soprano Diana Tash at the Festival de Mayo in Guadalajara, Mexico. In 2014, Asawa and Peter Somogyi established Asawa and Associates, an operatic artists' management agency. Personal life and death Asawa was openly gay and believed this had helped him discover his voice type. \\"Heterosexual men don't feel comfortable singing in a treble register because it's not butch\\", he told an interviewer in 1998. \\"Gay men feel quite comfortable singing in their falsetto registers.\\" He was married to Keith Fisher; the marriage ended in divorce. Asawa was the nephew of sculptor Ruth Asawa (1926-2013). He died of heart failure in Mission Hills, California, following a long illness on April 18, 2016, at the age of 49. Recordings Asawa's discography includes solo recital discs for RCA Victor Red Seal ranging from Dowland and Edmund Campion to Rachmaninoff and Ned Rorem. His opera recordings include Farnace in Mitridate for Decca, Arsamene in Serse for Conifer and Oberon in A Midsummer Night's Dream for Philips with the London Symphony Orchestra under Sir Colin Davis. Asawa appeared on DVD in Ligeti's \\"Le Grand Macabre\\" Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona, Monteverdi's \\"Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria\\" Opus Arte, Mussorgsky's \\"Boris Godunov\\" Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona, and Stravinsky's \\"The Rake's Progress\\" Kultur, as well as both a CD and DVD release of Handel's \\"Messiah\\" directed by Marc Minkowski. In 2014, Asawa and mezzo-soprano Diana Tash released an album of duets on the LML Music label that included works by Handel, Monteverdi, Purcell, A. Scarlatti and Marco da Gagliano.

While the laboratory does other research, historically it has been involved with nuclear research. Various organizations have built more than 50 reactors at what is commonly called \\"the Site\\", including the ones that gave America its first usable amount of electricity from nuclear power and the power plant for the world's first nuclear submarine. Although many are now decommissioned, these facilities are the largest concentration of reactors in the world. It is on a complex in the high desert of eastern Idaho, between Arco to the west and Idaho Falls and Blackfoot to the east. Atomic City, Idaho is just south. The laboratory employs approximately 4,000 people. History thumb thumb thumb What is now Idaho National Laboratory in southeastern Idaho began its life as a U.S. government artillery test range in the 1940s. Shortly after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, the U.S. military needed a safe location for performing maintenance on the Navy's most powerful turreted guns. The guns were brought in via rail to near Pocatello, Idaho, to be re-sleeved, rifled and tested. As the Navy began to focus on post-World War II and Cold War threats, the types of projects worked on in the Idaho desert changed, too. Perhaps the most well-known was the building of the prototype reactor for the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Nautilus. In 1949, the federal research facility was established as the National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS). In 1975, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was divided into the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The Idaho site was for a short time named ERDA and then subsequently renamed to the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) in 1977 with the creation of the United States Department of Energy (DOE) under President Jimmy Carter. After two decades as INEL, the name was changed again to the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) in 1997. Throughout its lifetime, there have been more than 50 one-of-a-kind nuclear reactors built by various organizations at the facility for testing; all but three are out of service. On Feb. 1, 2005, Battelle Energy Alliance took over operation of the lab from Bechtel, merged with Argonne National Laboratory-West, and the facility name was changed to \\"Idaho National Laboratory\\" (INL). At this time the site's clean-up activities were moved to a separate contract, the Idaho Cleanup Project, which is currently managed by Fluor Idaho, LLC. Research activities were consolidated in the newly named Idaho National Laboratory. According to AP news reports in April 2018, a single barrel of \\"radioactive sludge\\" ruptured while being prepared for transport to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Southeast New Mexico for permanent storage. The 55-gallon barrel that ruptured is part of the badly-documented radioactive waste from the Rocky Flats Plant near Denver; it is unknown how many such barrels are stored at Idaho National Laboratory, nor what each barrel contains. Access In the Snake River Plain, most of INL is high desert with scrub vegetation and a number of facilities scattered throughout the area; the average elevation of the complex is above sea level. INL is accessible by U.S. Route 20, and U.S. Route 26, but most of the area (except Experimental Breeder Reactor I) is restricted to authorized personnel and requires appropriate security clearance. The tiny town of Atomic City is on the INL's southern border, and the Craters of the Moon National Monument is to the southwest.  Research  =Nuclear Energy Projects= Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) One part of this program to develop improved nuclear power plants is the \\"Next Generation Nuclear Plant\\" or NGNP, which would be the demonstration of a new way to use nuclear energy for more than electricity. The heat generated from nuclear fission in the plant could provide process heat for hydrogen production and other industrial purposes, while also generating electricity. And the NGNP would use a high-temperature gas reactor, which would have redundant safety systems that rely on natural physical processes more than human or mechanical intervention. INL is working with private industry to design, plan and eventually build the NGNP. It was commissioned to lead this effort by the United States Department of Energy as a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Fuel Cycle Research & Development (FCRD) The Fuel Cycle Research & Development program aims to help expand nuclear energy's benefits by addressing some of the issues inherent to the current life cycle of nuclear reactor fuel in the United States. These efforts strive to make nuclear energy's expansion safe, secure, economic and sustainable. Currently, the United States, like many other countries, employs an \\"open-ended\\" nuclear fuel cycle, whereby nuclear power plant fuel is used only once and then placed in a repository for indefinite storage. One of the primary FCRD goals is to research, develop and demonstrate ways to \\"close\\" the fuel cycle so fuel is reused or recycled rather than being shelved before all of its energy has been used. INL coordinates many of the FCRD's national research efforts, including: * Continuing critical fuel cycle research and development (R&D;) activities * Pursuing the development of policy and regulatory framework to support fuel cycle closure * Developing deployable technologies * Establishing advanced modeling and simulation program elements * Implementing a science-based R&D; program Light Water Reactor Sustainability (LWRS) program The Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program supports national efforts to do the research and gather the information necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and prudent to apply for extensions beyond 60 years of operating life. The Program aims to safely and economically extend the service lives of the more than 100 electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the United States. The program brings together technical information, performs important research and organizes data to be used in license-extension applications. Advanced Test Reactor National Scientific User Facility (ATR NSUF) INL's Advanced Test Reactor is a unique research reactor located approximately from Idaho Falls, Idaho. The Department of Energy named Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) a National Scientific User Facility in April 2007. This designation opened the facility to use by university-led scientific research groups and gives them free access to the ATR and other unique resources at INL and partner facilities. In addition to a rolling proposal solicitation with two closing dates each year, INL holds an annual \\"Users Week\\" and summer session to familiarize researchers with the user facility capabilities available to them. Nuclear Energy University Programs (NEUP) DOE's Nuclear Energy University Programs provide funding for university research grants, fellowships, scholarships and infrastructure upgrades. For example, in May 2010, the program awarded $38 million for 42 university-led R&D; projects at 23 United States universities in 17 states. In FY 2009, the program awarded about $44 million to 71 R&D; projects and more than $6 million in infrastructure grants to 30 U.S. universities and colleges in 23 states. INL's Center for Advanced Energy Studies administers the program for DOE. CAES is a collaboration between INL and Idaho's three public research universities: Idaho State University, Boise State University and University of Idaho. Multiphysics Methods Group (MMG) The Multiphysics Methods Group (MMG) is a program at Idaho National Laboratory (under the United States Department of Energy) begun in 2004. It uses applications based on the multiphysics and modeling framework MOOSE to simulate complex physical and chemical reactions inside nuclear reactors . The ultimate goal of the program is to use these simulation tools to enable more efficient use of nuclear fuel, resulting in lower electricity costs and less waste products. The MMG focuses on problems within nuclear reactors related to its fuel and how heat is transferred inside the reactor. \\"Fuel degradation\\" refers to how uranium pellets and the rods they are encased in (several rods bundled together is what makes a \\"fuel assembly\\") eventually wear out over time due to high heat and irradiation inside a reactor. The group states three main objectives: \\"The mission of the MMG is to support the INL goal to advance the U.S. nuclear energy endeavor by: * Furthering the state of computational nuclear engineering * Developing a robust technical basis in multidimensional multiphysics analysis methods * Developing the next generation of reactor simulation codes and tools\\" The work done by the group directly supports programs such as the Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program's research into advanced nuclear fuels. =National and Homeland Security Projects= INL's National and Homeland Security division focuses on two main areas: protecting critical infrastructures such as electricity transmission lines, utilities and wireless communications networks, and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Control Systems Cybersecurity For nearly a decade, INL has been conducting vulnerability assessments and developing innovative technology to increase infrastructure resiliency. With a strong emphasis on industry collaboration and partnership, INL is enhancing electric grid reliability, control systems cybersecurity and physical security systems. INL conducts advanced cyber training and oversees simulated competitive exercises for national and international customers. The lab supports cyber security and control systems programs for the departments of Homeland Security, Energy and Defense. INL staff members are frequently asked to provide guidance and leadership to standards organizations, regulatory agencies and national policy committees. In January 2011, it was reported by The New York Times that the INL was allegedly responsible for some of the initial research behind the Stuxnet virus, which allegedly crippled Iran's nuclear centrifuges. The INL, which teamed up with Siemens, conducted research on the P.C.S.-7 control system to identify its vulnerabilities. According to the Times, that information would later be used by the American and Israeli governments to create the Stuxnet virus. The Times article was later disputed by other journalists, including Forbes blogger Jeffrey Carr, as being both sensational and lacking verifiable facts. In March 2011, Vanity Fair's magazine cover story on Stuxnet carried INL's official response, stating, \\"Idaho National Laboratory was not involved in the creation of the Stuxnet worm. In fact, our focus is to protect and defend control systems and critical infrastructures from cyber threats like Stuxnet and we are all well recognized for these efforts. We value the relationships that we have formed within the control systems industry and in no way would risk these partnerships by divulging confidential information.\\" Nuclear nonproliferation Building on INL's nuclear mission and legacy in reactor design and operations, the lab's engineers are developing technology, shaping policy and leading initiatives to secure the nuclear fuel cycle and prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Under the direction of the National Nuclear Security Administration, INL and other national laboratory scientists are leading a global initiative to secure foreign stockpiles of fresh and spent highly enriched uranium and return it to secure storage for processing. Other engineers are working to convert U.S. research reactors and build new reactor fuels that replace highly enriched uranium with a safer, low-enriched uranium fuel. To protect against threats from the dispersal of nuclear and radiological devices, INL researchers also examine radiological materials to understand their origin and potential uses. Others have applied their knowledge to the development of detection technologies that scan and monitor containers for nuclear materials. The laboratory's expansive desert location, nuclear facilities and wide range of source materials provide an ideal training location for military responders, law enforcement and other civilian first responders. INL routinely supports these organizations by leading classroom training, conducting field exercises and assisting in technology assessments. =Energy and environment projects= Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity INL's Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity gathers information from more than 4000 plug-in-hybrid vehicles. These vehicles, operated by a wide swath of companies, local and state governments, advocacy groups, and others are located all across the United States, Canada and Finland. Together, they've logged a combined 1.5 million miles worth of data that are analyzed by specialists at INL. Dozens of other types of vehicles, like hydrogen-fueled and pure electric cars, are also tested at INL. This data will help evaluate the performance and other factors that will be critical to widespread adoption of plug-in or other alternative vehicles. Bioenergy INL researchers are partnering with farmers, agricultural equipment manufacturers and universities to optimize the logistics of an industrial-scale biofuel economy. Agricultural waste products ‚Äî such as wheat straw; corncobs, stalks or leaves; or bioenergy crops such as switchgrass or miscanthus ‚Äî could be used to create cellulosic biofuels. INL researchers are working to determine the most economic and sustainable ways to get biofuel raw materials from fields to biorefineries. Robotics INL's robotics program researches, builds, tests and refines robots that, among other things, clean up dangerous wastes, measure radiation, scout drug-smuggling tunnels, aid search-and-rescue operations, and help protect the environment. These robots roll, crawl, fly, and go under water, even in swarms that communicate with each other on the go to do their jobs. Biological Systems The Biological Systems department is housed in 15 laboratories with a total of at the INL Research Center in Idaho Falls. The department engages in a wide variety of biological studies, including studying bacteria and other microbes that live in extreme conditions such as the extremely high temperature pools of Yellowstone National Park. These types of organisms could boost the efficiency of biofuels production. Other studies related to uncommon microbes have potential in areas such as carbon dioxide sequestration and groundwater cleanup. Hybrid energy systems INL is pioneering the research and testing associated with hybrid energy systems that combine multiple energy sources for optimum carbon management and energy production. For example, a nuclear reactor could provide electricity when certain renewable resources aren't available, while also providing a carbon-free source of heat and hydrogen that could be used, for example, to make liquid transportation fuels from coal. Nuclear waste processing construction of a new liquid waste processing facility, the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit (IWTU), was nearing completion at INTEC on the INL site. It will process approximately 900,000 gallons of liquid nuclear waste using a steam reforming process to produce a granular product suitable for disposal. The facility is the first of its kind and based on a scaled prototype. The project is a part of the Department of Energy's Idaho Cleanup Project aimed at removing waste and demolishing old nuclear facilities at the INL site. =Interdisciplinary projects= The Instrumentation, Control and Intelligent Systems (ICIS) Distinctive Signature supports mission-related research and development in key capability areas: safeguards and control system security, sensor technologies, intelligent automation, human systems integration, and robotics and intelligent systems. These five key areas support the INL mission to \\"ensure the nation's energy security with safe, competitive, and sustainable energy systems and unique national and homeland security.\\" Through its grand challenge in resilient control systems, ICIS research is providing a holistic approach to aspects of design that have often been bolt-on, including human systems, security and modeling of complex interdependency. Outreach =Scholarships and grants= INL supports science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education in classrooms across the state. Each year, the lab invests nearly $500,000 in Idaho teachers and students. Funding goes toward scholarship programs for high school graduates, technical college students and teachers who want to integrate more hands-on science activities into their lessons. INL also provides thousands of dollars worth of classroom grants to teachers seeking to upgrade their science equipment or lab infrastructure. =Internships= The lab hires more than 300 interns each summer to work alongside laboratory employees. INL is listed by Vault, the online job resource site, as one of the best places in the U.S. to get an internship Internships are offered to high school, undergraduate, graduate and post- graduate students in applicable fields including science, engineering, math, chemistry, business, communication and other fields. =Small business outreach= In addition to subcontracting more than $100 million worth of work from Idaho's small businesses, INL technologies are often licensed to new or existing companies for commercialization. In the past 10 years, INL has negotiated roughly 500 technology licenses. And INL technology has spawned more than 40 start-up companies since 1995. Small businesses that contract with the lab can participate in a Department of Energy program designed to enhance their capabilities. INL has worked with a variety of small businesses in this mentoring capacity, including International Management Solutions and Portage Environmental. Unique facilities =Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) complex= thumb INL's Advanced Test Reactor is much smaller than the more common electricity-producing reactors ‚Äî the reactor vessel measures across and high, with the core a mere tall and across, and it does not generate electricity. As a special feature, it allows scientists to simultaneously test materials in multiple unique experimental environments. Research scientists can place experiments in one of the more than 70 test positions in the reactor. Each can generate unique experimental conditions. Some have called the reactor a \\"virtual time machine\\", for its ability to demonstrate the effects of several years of radiation on materials in a fraction of the time. The ATR allows scientists to place a great variety of materials in an environment with specified intensities of radiation, temperature, and pressure. Specimens are then removed to examine how the time in the reactor affected the materials. The U.S. Navy is the facility's primary user, but the ATR also produces medical isotopes that can help treat cancer patients and industrial isotopes that can be used for radiography to x-ray welds on items such as skyscrapers, bridges and ship holds. Many ATR experiments focus on materials that could make the next generation of nuclear reactors even safer and longer lasting. =Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC)= Hot Fuel Examination Facility The Hot Fuel Examination Facility (HFEF) gives INL researchers and other scientists the ability to examine and test highly radioactive irradiated reactor fuel and other materials. HFEF provides 15 state-of-the-art workstations known as hot cells. For windows, each cell has leaded glass panes layered thick and separated by thin layers of oil. Remote manipulators allow users to maneuver items inside the hot cell using robotic arms. And special filtered exhaust systems keep indoor and outdoor air safe. At these stations, scientists and technicians can better determine the performance of irradiated fuels and materials. Scientists can also characterize materials destined for long-term storage at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. Space and Security Power Systems Facility The New Horizons mission to Pluto, which launched in 2006, is powered by a device fueled at the INL Space and Security Power Systems Facility. The Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) uses nonfissionable nonweapons- grade plutonium to produce heat and electricity for deep space missions such as this one. Using the RTG on the New Horizons mission is a more practical power source for the satellite than solar panels because the satellite will travel to such a great distance that energy from the sun would provide insufficient power for the craft. Work on the project started in late 2004 and ended with the January 2006 successful rocket launch. The team implemented the fueling, testing and delivery of the RTG for the Pluto New Horizons mission and for the next Mars rover. Fuel Conditioning Facility INL's Fuel Conditioning Facility uses electrolysis to separate certain components from used nuclear fuel rods. Unlike traditional aqueous reprocessing techniques, which dissolve the fuel rods in acid, \\"pyroprocessing\\" melts the rods and uses electricity to separate components such as uranium and sodium out of the mix. INL is using this technique to remove the sodium metal from Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II) fuel rods so they can be safely stored in a national repository. = Transient Reactor Test Facility (TREAT) = The Transient Reactor Test Facility (TREAT) is a reactor designed specifically to test new reactor fuels and materials. =Critical Infrastructure Test Range Complex (CITRC)= The Critical Infrastructure Test Range at INL's Site allows researchers to conduct resiliency exercises and experiments from conceptual design to full-scale demonstration. INL also has access to a utility-scale power grid, substations, unique real-time modeling and simulation systems, and vendor-supplied Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for demonstration and deployment exercises. In addition, INL owns and operates a communications network designed to research and test cellular, mobile and emerging Internet communication protocols and technology, with both fixed and mobile 3-G platforms that allow testing and demonstration within a range of experimental frequencies in a low-background environment. =Research and Education Campus in Idaho Falls= Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES) This unique partnership between INL and Idaho's three public research universities ‚Äî Idaho State University, University of Idaho, and Boise State University ‚Äî boasts a wealth of research expertise. Its researchers, who have access to each partner institution's equipment and infrastructure, have competed for and won millions of dollars in national funding for their projects. CAES possesses capabilities and infrastructure unique to the region and nation. The center's laboratories are equipped with state-of-the-art research instruments and tools, including a Local Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP) and a Computer Assisted Virtual Environment (CAVE). Matched Index of Refraction (MIR) facility The Matched Index of Refraction facility is the largest such facility in the world. Using light mineral oil, the facility allows researchers to use fused quartz models built to scale to study the flow of liquids inside and around objects with complicated geometries, such as the core of a nuclear reactor. The facility is basically a giant loop through which the mostly transparent oil is pumped at variable speeds. Special lasers perform \\"Doppler velocimetry\\", that produces a three-dimensional image allowing inspection of an object's flow properties. Observers can also watch the flow themselves through the polycarbonate viewing panes near the laser equipment. Video: Matched Index of Refraction Flow Facility Geocentrifuge A scientist works on the large geocentrifuge of the Geocentrifuge Research Laboratory at the Idaho National Laboratory. INL's geocentrifuge helps researchers, among other efforts, improve models of how liquids and contaminants move through engineered caps and barriers used in underground waste disposal facilities. The INL centrifuge is one of fewer than 25 geocentrifuges larger than two meters (about 6 feet) in the United States. The centrifuge, located next to the INL Research Center in Idaho Falls, can be operated remotely by computer and is capable of applying 130 times the force of earth's gravity on a sample. Many of the experiments that use the geocentrifuge require it to run for hundreds of hours in order to correctly simulate several years' worth of gravitational effects. The payload is monitored by an onboard computer and can be relayed to a remote monitoring station outside the centrifuge's chamber where technicians can observe developments. Earlier projects =Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I)= The first four bulbs lit by electricity from nuclear power hung near the generator on the second floor of EBR-I In the early afternoon of December 20, 1951, Argonne National Laboratory scientist Walter Zinn and a small crew of assistants witnessed a row of four light bulbs light up in a nondescript brick building in the eastern Idaho desert. Electricity from a generator connected to Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I) flowed through them. This was the first time that a usable amount of electrical power had ever been generated from nuclear fission. Only days afterward, the reactor produced all the electricity needed for the entire EBR complex. One ton of natural uranium can produce more than 40 million kilowatt-hours of electricity ‚Äî this is equivalent to burning 16,000 tons of coal or 80,000 barrels of oil. More central to EBR-I's purpose than just generating electricity, however, was its role in proving that a reactor could create more nuclear fuel as a by- product than it consumed during operation. In 1953, tests verified that this was the case. The site of this event is memorialized as a Registered National Historic Landmark, open to the public every day Memorial Day through Labor Day. =Fatal incident= The SL-1 reactor vessel being removed from the reactor building. It had jumped over during the accident. On January 3, 1961, the only fatal nuclear reactor incident in the U.S. occurred at the NRTS. An experimental reactor called SL-1 (Stationary Low-Power Plant Number 1) was destroyed when a control rod was pulled too far out of the reactor, leading to core meltdown and a steam explosion. The reactor vessel jumped up . The concussion and blast killed all three military enlisted personnel working on the reactor. Due to the extensive radioactive isotope contamination, all three were buried in lead coffins. The events are the subject of two books, one published in 2003, Idaho Falls: The untold story of America's first nuclear accident, and another, Atomic America: How a Deadly Explosion and a Feared Admiral Changed the Course of Nuclear History, published in 2009. =Incidents: Container leaks \\"plutonium-related-materials\\"= On November 8, 2011 in the Zero Power Physics Reactor (ZPPR) in the afternoon a container leaked \\"plutonium-related\\" materials, when it was opened by one of the workers. All 17 workers at the incident were immediately taken to have testing done by the Idaho Cleanup Project in the form of Whole Body Counts (scans the body for any internal radiation exposure) and were required to submit urine and fecal samples to further test for internal radioisotopes. Six of them proved to be exposed to \\"low-level-radiation\\", two of them fairly extensively. All workers were kept under close observation afterwards with repeated Whole Body Counts and urine and fecal sampling. The Idaho National Laboratory insisted that no radioactivity leaked outside the facility. =Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II)= From 1969 to 1994, Argonne National Laboratory's EBR-II produced nearly half of the electricity needed for test site operations. In 1964, Experimental Breeder Reactor II and the nearby Fuel Conditioning Facility proved the concept of fuel recycling and passive safety characteristics. So-called \\"passive\\" safety includes systems that rely on natural physics laws such as gravity rather than systems that require mechanical or human intervention. In a landmark test on April 3, 1986, such systems in EBR-II demonstrated that nuclear power plants could be designed to be inherently safe from severe accidents. De-commissioning of EBR-II began in October 1994 with the removal of the 637 fuel assemblies. =Loss of Fluid Test (LOFT) facility= The Loss-of-Fluid-Test reactor The world's first Loss- of-Fluid-Test reactor started up at INL on March 12, 1976. It repeatedly simulated loss-of-coolant accidents that could potentially occur in commercial nuclear power plants. Many safety designs for reactors around the world are based on these tests. LOFT experiments helped accident recovery efforts after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. =Test Area North= In 1949, an area of the fringe of the NRTS property named \\"Test Area North\\", or TAN, was developed by the U.S. Air Force and the Atomic Energy Commission to support the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion program's attempt to develop a nuclear-powered aircraft. The program's Heat Transfer Reactor Experiments (HTRE) were conducted here in 1955 by contractor General Electric, and were a series of tests to develop a system of transferring reactor-heated air to a modified General Electric J47 jet engine. The planned aircraft, the Convair X-6, was to be test flown at TAN, and a large hangar with radiation shielding was built on the site. The program was cancelled, however, before the accompanying runway could be built. =Naval Reactors Facility (NRF)= In the early 1950s, the very first full-scale prototype nuclear plant for shipboard use, called S1W Prototype, was constructed to test the feasibility of using nuclear power aboard submarines. It was the predecessor to a similar nuclear plant of S2W design installed in the first nuclear-powered ship, the submarine . Later, two more prototype plant facilities, A1W and S5G, were built at this location called the Naval Reactors Facility (NRF for short). There is also an Expended Core Facility (ECF for short) also at NRF as well as administrative buildings/facilities. NRF's chemistry lab was located at the S1W prototype. By now, the prototype plants for shipboard use development have been shut down. Only the Expended Core Facility / Dry Storage Area is in use. =Materials Test Reactor (MTR)= When the nuclear industry was just getting started in the early 1950s, it was difficult to predict exactly how different kinds of metals and other materials would be affected by being used in a reactor for prolonged periods of time. MTR was a research reactor jointly designed by Argonne and Oak Ridge National Laboratories that operated until 1970 and provided important data, helping researchers make nuclear power reactors safer and longer lasting.http://www.dailymotion.com/video/subtitle/create/x2fls8n_gglass-oil- extractor_tech =BORAX Experiments= The BORAX III reactor. The Boiling Water Reactors (BORAX) experiments were five reactors built between 1953 and 1964 by Argonne National Laboratory. They proved that the boiling water concept was a feasible design for an electricity-producing nuclear reactor. The BORAX III reactor was also the first in the world to power a community (Arco, Idaho) on July 17, 1955.http://www.deq.state.id.us/inl_oversight/about/facilities/borax.cfm =Other sites= The Idaho Chemical Processing Plant chemically processed material from used reactor cores to recover reusable nuclear material. It is now called the . The Materials Test Area tested materials' exposure to reactor conditions. The Materials Test Area is part of the Advanced Test Reactor Complex.

It relates the history of Sri Lanka from its legendary beginnings up to the reign of Mahasena of Anuradhapura (A.D. 302) covering the period between the arrival of Prince Vijaya from India in 543 BCE to his reign (277‚Äì304 CE) and later updated by different writers. It was composed by a Buddhist monk at the Mahavihara temple in Anuradhapura about the fifth century A.D.  Contents  The contents of the Mahavamsa can be broadly divided into four categories: * The Buddha's Visits to Sri Lanka: This material recounts three legendary visits by the Buddha to the island of Sri Lanka. These stories describe the Buddha subduing or driving away the Yakkhas (Yakshas) and Nagas that were inhabiting the island and delivering a prophecy that Sri Lanka will become an important Buddhist center. These visits are not mentioned in the Pali Canon or other early sources. * Chronicles of Kings of Sri Lanka: This material consists of genealogies and lineages of kings of Sri Lanka, sometimes with stories about their succession or notable incidents in their reigns. This material may have been derived from earlier royal chronicles and king lists that were recorded orally in vernacular languages, and are a significant source of material about the history of Sri Lanka and nearby Indian kingdoms. * History of the Buddhist Sangha: This section of the Mahavamsa deals with the mission sent by Emperor Ashoka to Sri Lanka, the transplantation of the bodhi tree, and the founding of the Mahavihara. It includes the names of prominent monks and nuns in the early Sri Lankan sangha. It also includes accounts of the early Buddhist councils and the first recording of the Pali canon in writing. This is a significant source of material about the development of the early Buddhist community, and includes the names of missionaries dispatched to various regions of South and Southeast Asia, some of which have been confirmed by inscriptions and other archaeological evidence. * Chronicles of Sri Lanka: This material begins with the immigration of King Vijaya from India with his retinue and continues until the reign of King Mahasena, recounting wars, succession disputes, building of stupas and reliquaries, and other notable incidents. An extensive chronicle of the war between the Sinhala King Dutthagamani and Tamil King Elara (861 verses in the Mahavamsa compared with 13 verses in the Dipavamsa) may represent the incorporation of a popular epic from the vernacular tradition. While much of the contents of the Mahavamsa is derived from expansions of the material found in the Dipavamsa, several passages specifically dealing with the Abhayagiri vihara are omitted, suggesting that the Mahavamsa was more specifically associated with the Mahavihara. History Buddhist monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya maintained chronicles of Sri Lankan history starting from the third century BCE. These annals were combined and compiled into a single document in the 5th Century while Dhatusena of Anuradhapura was ruling the Anuradhapura Kingdom. It was written based on prior ancient compilations known as the Atthakatha (sometimes Sinhalaatthakatha), which were commentaries written in Sinhala. An earlier document known as the Dipavamsa (4th century CE) \\"Island Chronicles\\" is much simpler and contains less information than the Mahavamsa and was probably compiled using the Atthakatha on the Mahavamsa as well. Authorship of the Mahavamsa is attributed to a monk called MahƒÅnƒÅma by the Mahavamsa-tika (see #Related Works). MahƒÅnƒÅma is described as residing in a monastery belonging to general Dighasanda and affiliated with the Mahavihara, but no other reliable biographical information is known. MahƒÅnƒÅma introduces the Mahavamsa with a passage that claims that his intention is to correct repetitions and shortcomings that afflicted the chronicle compiled by the ancients- this may refer either to the Dipavamsa or to the Sinhala Atthakatha. A companion volume, the Culavamsa \\"Lesser Chronicle\\", compiled by Sinhala monks, covers the period from the 4th century to the British takeover of Sri Lanka in 1815. The Culavamsa was compiled by a number of authors of different time periods. The combined work, sometimes referred to collectively as the Mahavamsa, provides a continuous historical record of over two millennia, and is considered one of the world's longest unbroken historical accounts. It is one of the few documents containing material relating to the NƒÅga and Yakkha peoples, indigenous inhabitants of Lanka prior to the legendary arrival of Prince Vijaya from Singha Pura of Kalinga. As it often refers to the royal dynasties of India, the Mahavamsa is also valuable for historians who wish to date and relate contemporary royal dynasties in the Indian subcontinent. It is very important in dating the consecration of the Maurya Emperor Ashoka, which is related to the synchronicity with the Seleucid Empire and Alexander the Great. Indian excavations in Sanchi and other locations, confirm the Mahavamsa account of the empire of Ashoka. The accounts given in the Mahavamsa are also amply supported by the numerous stone inscriptions, mostly in Sinhala, found in Sri Lanka.Geiger's discussion of the historicity of the Mahavamsa;Paranavitana and Nicholas, A concise history of Ceylon (Ceylon University Press) 1961 K. Indrapala K. Indrapala, Evolution of an Ethnicity, 2005 has also upheld the historical value of the Mahavamsa. If not for the Mahavamsa, the story behind the large stupas in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, such as Ruwanwelisaya, Jetavanaramaya, Abhayagiri vihƒÅra and other works of ancient engineering would never have been known. The Mahavamsa first came to the attention of Western readers around 1809 CE, when Sir Alexander Johnston, Chief Justice of the British colony in Ceylon, sent manuscripts of it and other Sri Lankan chronicles to Europe for publication. Eug√®ne Burnouf produced a Romanized transliteration and translation into Latin in 1826, but these garnered relatively little attention. Working from Johnston's manuscripts, Edward Upham published an English translation in 1833, but it was marked by a number of errors in translation and interpretation, among them suggesting that the Buddha was born in Sri Lanka and built a monastery atop Adam's Peak. The first printed edition and widely read English translation was published in 1837 by George Turnour, an historian and officer of the Ceylon Civil Service. A German translation of Mahavamsa was completed by Wilhelm Geiger in 1912. This was then translated into English by Mabel Haynes Bode, and revised by Geiger.  Historical and literary significance  Historiographical sources are rare in much of South Asia. As a result of the Mahavamsa, comparatively more is known about the history of the island of Ceylon and neighboring regions than that of most of the subcontinent. Its contents have aided in the identification and corroboration of archaeological sites and inscriptions associated with early Buddhism, the empire of Ashoka, and the Tamil kingdoms of southern India. The Mahamvasa covers the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, beginning with the time of Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism. It also briefly recounts the history of Buddhism in India, from the date of the Buddha's death to the 3rd Buddhist council where the Dharma was reviewed. Every chapter of the Mahavamsa ends by stating that it is written for the \\"serene joy of the pious\\". From the emphasis of its point-of-view, and being compiled to record the good deeds of the kings who were patrons of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya,In general, regarding the Mahavamsa's point-of-view, see it has been said to support Sinhalese nationalism.E. F. C. Ludowyk's discussion of the connection between religion in the Mahavamsa and state-power is discussed in . Besides being an important historical source, the Mahavamsa is the most important epic poem in the Pali language. Its stories of battles and invasions, court intrigue, great constructions of stupas and water reservoirs, written in elegant verse suitable for memorization, caught the imagination of the Buddhist world of the time. Unlike many texts written in antiquity, it also discusses various aspects of the lives of ordinary people, how they joined the King's army or farmed. Thus the Mahavamsa was taken along the Silk Road to many Buddhist lands. Parts of it were translated, retold, and absorbed into other languages. An extended version of the Mahavamsa, which gives many more details, has also been found in Southeast Asia.Dr. Hema Goonatilake, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka. 2003 The Mahavamsa gave rise to many other Pali chronicles, making Sri Lanka of that period probably the world's leading center in Pali literature. Political significance The Mahavamsa has, especially in modern Sri Lanka, acquired a significance as a document with a political message.H. Bechert, \\"The beginnings of Buddhist Historiography in Ceylon, Mahawamsa and Political Thinking\\", Ceylon Studies Seminar, Series 2, 1974 The Sinhalese majority often use Manavamsa as a proof of their claim that Sri Lanka is a Buddhist nation from historical time. The British historian Jane RussellCommunal politics under the Donoughmore Constitution, 1931‚Äì1947, Tissara Publishers, Colombo 1982 has recounted how a process of \\"Mahavamsa bashing\\" began in the 1930s, especially from within the Tamil Nationalist movement. The Mahavamsa, being a history of the Sinhala Buddhists, presented itself to the Tamil Nationalists and the Sinhala Nationalists as the hegemonic epic of the Sinhala people. This view was attacked by G. G. Ponnambalam, the leader of the Nationalist Tamils in the 1930s. He claimed that most of the Sinhala kings, including Vijaya, Kasyapa, and Parakramabahu, were Tamils. Ponnambalam's 1939 speech in Nawalapitiya, attacking the claim that Sri Lanka is a Sinhalese, Buddhist nation was seen as an act against the notion of creating a Buddhist only nation. The Sinhala majority responded with a mob riot, which engulfed Nawalapitiya, Passara, Maskeliya, and even Jaffna.Hindu Organ, June 1, 1939 issue (Newspaper archived at the Jaffna University Library) The riots were rapidly put down by the British colonial government, but later this turned through various movements into the civil war in Sri Lanka which ended in 2009. Various writers have called into question the morality of the account given in the Mahavamsa, where Dutugamunu regrets his actions in killing Ellalan and his troops. The Mahavamsa equates the killing of the invaders as being on par with the killing of \\"sinners and wild beasts\\", and the King's sorrow and regret are assuaged. This is considered by some critics as an ethical error. However, Buddhism does recognize a hierarchy of actions as being more or less wholesome or skillful, although the intent is as much as or more important than the action itself. Thus the killing of an Arahant may be considered less wholesome and skillful than the killing of an ordinary human being. Buddhists may also assert that killing an elephant is less skillful and wholesome than killing an ant. In both cases, however, the intent must also be considered. An important thing to note is that Dutthagamani regretted his act, and this was also true of King Ashoka, who became a pacifist after a series of bloody military campaigns. Historical accuracy Early Western scholars like Otto Franke dismissed the possibility that the Mahavamsa contained reliable historical content, but subsequent evidence from inscriptions and archaeological finds have confirmed that there is a factual basis for many of the stories recorded in the Mahavamsa, including Ashoka's missionary work and the kings associated with founding various monasteries and stupas. Wilhelm Geiger was one of the first Western scholars to suggest that it was possible to separate useful historical information from the mythic and poetic elaborations of the chronicle. While other scholars had assumed that the Mahavamsa had been assembled from borrowed material from Indian Pali sources, Geiger hypothesized that the Mahavamsa had been based on earlier Sinhala sources that originated on the island of Ceylon. While Geiger did not believe that the details provided with every story and name were reliable, he broke from earlier scholars in believing that the Mahavamsa faithfully reflected an earlier tradition that had preserved the names and deeds of various royal and religious leaders, rather than being a pure work of heroic literary fiction. He regarded the early chapters of the Culavamsa as the most accurate, with the early chapters of the Mahavamsa being too remote historically and the later sections of the Culavamsa marked by excessive elaboration. Geiger's Sinhala student G. C. Mendis was more openly skeptical about certain portions of the text, specifically citing the story of the Sinhala ancestor Vijaya as being too remote historically from its source and too similar to an epic poem or other literary creation to be seriously regarded as history. The date of Vijaya's arrival is thought to have been artificially fixed to coincide with the date for the death of Gautama Buddha around 543 BCE.E.J. Thomas. (1913). BUDDHIST SCRIPTURES. Available: http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/busc/busc03.htm. Last accessed 26 03 10. The Chinese pilgrims Fa Hsien and Hsuan Tsang both recorded myths of the origins of the Sinhala people in their travels that varied significantly from the versions recorded in the Mahavamsa- in one version, the Sinhala are descended from naga or nature spirits who traded with Indian merchants, and in another the Sinhala progenitor is a prince exiled for patricide who then slays a wealthy merchant and adopts his 500 children. The story of the Buddha's three visits to Sri Lanka are not recorded in any source outside of the Mahavamsa tradition. Moreover, the genealogy of the Buddha recorded in the Mahavamsa describes him as being the product of four cross cousin marriages. Cross- cousin marriage is associated historically with the Dravidian people of southern India- both Sri Lankan Tamils and Sinhala practiced cross-cousin marriage historically- but exogamous marriage was the norm in the regions of northern India associated with the life of the Buddha. No mention of cross- cousin marriage is found in earlier Buddhist sources, and scholars suspect that this genealogy was created in order to fit the Buddha into conventional Sri Lankan social structures for noble families.Thomas R. Trautmann. ‚ÄúConsanguineous Marriage in Pali Literature.‚Äù Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. 93, no. 2, 1973, pp. 158‚Äì180. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/598890. Accessed 14 May 2020. The historical accuracy of Mahinda converting the Sri Lankan king to Buddhism is also debated. Hermann Oldenberg, a German scholar of Indology who has published studies on the Buddha and translated many Pali texts, considers this story a \\"pure invention\\". V. A. Smith (Author of Ashoka and Early history of India) also refers to this story as \\"a tissue of absurdities\\". V. A. Smith and Professor Hermann came to this conclusion due to Ashoka not mentioning the handing over of his son, Mahinda, to the temple to become a Buddhist missionary and Mahinda's role in converting the Sri Lankan king to Buddhism, in his 13th year Rock Edicts, particularly Rock-Edict XIII.Wilhelm Geiger (1912). Mahavamsa: Great Chronicle of Ceylon. New Dehli: Asian Educational Services. 16-20. Sources outside of Sri Lanka and the Mahavamsa tradition do not mention Mahinda as Ashoka's son. There is also an inconsistency with the year on which Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to Sri Lanka. According to the Mahavamsa, the missionaries arrived in 255 BCE, but according to Edict 13, it was five years earlier in 260 BCE.  Related works  The Mahavamsa is believed to have originated from an earlier chronicle known as the Dipavamsa (4th century CE) (\\"Island Chronicles\\"). The Dipavamsa is much simpler and contains less information than the Mahavamsa and probably served as the nucleus of an oral tradition that was eventually incorporated into the written Mahavamsa. The Dipavamsa is believed to have been the first Pali text composed entirely in Ceylon. A subsequent work sometimes known as Culavamsa extends the Mahavamsa to cover the period from the reign of Mahasena of Anuradhapura (277‚Äì304 CE) until 1815, when the entire island was surrendered to the British throne. The Culavamsa contains three sections composed by five different authors (one anonymous) belonging to successive historical periods. In 1935, Buddhist monk Yagirala Pannananda published Mahavamsa Part III, a Sinhala language continuation of the Mahavamsa that covers the period from the end of the Culavamsa up until 1935. While not authorized or supported by any government or religious organization, this continuation of the Mahavamsa was later recognized by the government of Sri Lankan Prime Minister JR Jayawardene. A commentary on the Mahavamsa, known as the Mahavamsa-tika, is believed to have been composed before the first additions composing the Culavamsa were written, likely some time between AD 1000 and AD 1250. This commentary provides explanations of ambiguous Pali terms used in the Mahvamasa, and in some cases adds additional details or clarifies differences between different versions of the Mahavamsa. Unlike the Mahavamsa itself, which is composed almost entirely from material associated with the Mahavihara, the Mahavamsa-tika makes several references to commentaries and alternate versions of the chronicle associated with the Abhayagiri vihara tradition. In Southeast Asia, a Pali work referred to as the 'Extended Mahavamsa' includes not only the text of the Sri Lankan Mahavamsa, but also elements of the Thupavamsa, Buddhavamsa, Mahavamsa commentaries, and quotations from various jatakas. It is sometimes referred to in academic literature as the 'Kambodian Mahavamsa' or 'Khmer Mahavamsa' because it is distinguished by being recorded in the Khmer script. Its composition is attributed to an otherwise unknown monk called Moggallana and its exact date of composition and origin are unknown, but suspected to be Burma or Thailand.

Byrd, Jr., USN (Ret), Officer in Charge, Task Force 68, and led by Rear Admiral Richard H. Cruzen, USN, Commanding Officer, Task Force 68. Operation HIGHJUMP commenced 26 August 1946 and ended in late February 1947. Task Force 68 included 4,700 men, 13 ships, and 33 aircraft. Operation HIGHJUMP‚Äôs primary mission was to establish the Antarctic research base Little America IV. HIGHJUMP‚Äôs objectives, according to the U.S. Navy report of the operation, were: # Training personnel and testing equipment in frigid conditions; # Consolidating and extending the United States' sovereignty over the largest practicable area of the Antarctic continent (publicly denied as a goal even before the expedition ended); # Determining the feasibility of establishing, maintaining, and utilizing bases in the Antarctic and investigating possible base sites; # Developing techniques for establishing, maintaining, and utilizing air bases on ice, with particular attention to later applicability of such techniques to operations in interior Greenland, where conditions are comparable to those in the Antarctic; # Amplifying existing stores of knowledge of electromagnetic, geological, geographic, hydrographic, and meteorological propagation conditions in the area; # Supplementary objectives of the Nanook expedition (a smaller equivalent conducted off eastern Greenland). Timeline The Western Group of ships reached the Marquesas Islands on December 12, 1946, whereupon the Henderson and Cacapon set up weather monitoring stations. By December 24, the Currituck had begun launching aircraft on reconnaissance missions. The Eastern Group of ships reached Peter I Island in late December 1946. On December 30, 1946 the Martin PBM-5 George 1 crashed on Thurston Island killing Ensign Maxwell A. Lopez, ARM1 Wendell K. Henderson, and ARM1 Frederick W. Williams. The other 6 crew members were rescued 13 days later. These and Vance N. Woodall, who died on January 21, 1947, were the only fatalities during Operation Highjump. On January 1, 1947, Lieutenant Commander Thompson and Chief Petty Officer Dixon utilized \\"Jack Browne\\" masks and DESCO Oxygen rebreathers to log the first dive by Americans under the Antarctic. Paul Allman Siple, Ph.D. was the senior U.S. War Department representative on the expedition. Dr. Siple was the same Eagle Scout who accompanied Admiral Byrd on the previous Byrd Antarctic expeditions. The Central Group of ships reached the Bay of Whales on January 15, 1947, where they began construction of Little America IV. Naval ships and personnel were withdrawn back to the United States in late February 1947, and the expedition was terminated due to the early approach of winter and worsening weather conditions. Admiral Byrd discussed the lessons learned from the operation in an interview with Lee van Atta of International News Service held aboard the expedition's command ship the USS Mount Olympus. The interview appeared in the Wednesday, March 5, 1947, edition of the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio and read in part as follows: > Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt > measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country > by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The admiral explained that > he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of > a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or > both poles. This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own > polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. > Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most > important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect > that they have in relation to the security of the United States. The > fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking ‚Äì recalled the admiral ‚Äì > is one of the most important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic > exploration. I have to warn my compatriots that the time has ended when we > were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the > distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety. After the operation ended, a follow-up Operation WINDMILL returned to the area in order to provide ground-truthing to the aerial photography of HIGHJUMP from 1947 to 1948. Finn Ronne also financed a private operation to the same territory until 1948. As with other U.S. Antarctic expeditions, interested persons were allowed to send letters with enclosed envelopes to the base, where commemorative cachets were added to their enclosures, which were then returned to the senders. These souvenir philatelic covers are readily available at low cost. It is estimated that at least 150,000 such envelopes were produced, though their final number may be considerably higher. Human losses On December 30, 1946, aviation radiomen Wendell K. Henderson, Fredrick W. Williams, and Ensign Maxwell A. Lopez were killed when their Martin PBM Mariner George 1 crashed during a blizzard. The surviving six crew members were rescued 13 days later, including aviation radioman James H. Robbins and co-pilot William Kearns. A plaque honoring the three killed crewmen was later erected at the McMurdo Station research base, and Mount Lopez on Thurston Island was named in honor of killed airman Maxwell A. Lopez. In December 2004, an attempt was made to locate the remains of the plane. In 2007 a group called the George One Recovery Team was unsuccessful in trying to get direct military involvement and raise extensive funds from the United States Congress to try and find the bodies of the three men killed in the crash. On January 21, 1947, Vance N. Woodall died during a \\"ship unloading accident\\". In a crew profile, deckman Edward Beardsley described his worst memory as \\"when Seaman Vance Woodall died on the Ross Ice Shelf under a piece of roller equipment designed to 'pave' the ice to build an airstrip.\\" Participating units Sikorsky R-4 helicopter landing on icebreaker USCGC Northwind during Operation Highjump ;Task Force 68 Rear Admiral Richard H.

Education and works Malcolm Mackerras was born at Turramurra in Sydney in August 1939. He is a brother of the late Sir Charles Mackerras, a well-known conductor, and twin brother of Professor Colin Mackerras, a leading China specialist. Another brother, Neil Mackerras, was active in the Democratic Labor Party in its early years. Yet another, Alastair Mackerras, was headmaster (principal) of Sydney Grammar School from 1969 to 1989. After attending St Aloysius' College, Milson's Point (1947‚Äì1951) and Sydney Grammar School (1952-1956) Malcolm was employed by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company (BHP) from 1957‚Äì1960, during which time he studied at night for the degree of Bachelor of Economics at the University of Sydney (awarded 1962). Mackerras was a member of the ACT Young Liberals in the late 1960s. His second employer was the Federal Secretariat of the Liberal Party of Australia for which he was a research officer (1960‚Äì1967). The organisation moved him to Canberra where he has lived continuously since 1965. He spent several years as a ministerial assistant and three years as an economist with the Chamber of Manufactures (1968‚Äì1970), \\"trying to present the case for protection for Australian manufacturing industry\\". In 1974 Mackerras was employed in the Department of Government at RMC Duntroon by the University of New South Wales. He went on to become an Associate Professor in Political Science, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, at the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra in 1999. Mackerras retired from UNSW in 2004. Mackerras is now an Honorary Fellow at Australian Catholic University, Canberra Campus. He is especially interested in elections and electoral systems. His several books and many journal articles are largely in those areas. He has written many articles for The Australian and The Canberra Times on these subjects. He likes whenever possible to visit countries during their elections. He visited South Africa in 1999 as an observer for that country's second democratic election (May‚ÄìJune 1999). He likes, in particular, to be in the United States for a presidential election as it greatly improves his American teaching. During his stay in the US in November‚ÄìDecember 2000, there was a \\"snap\\" election in Canada, which he visited, enabling him to improve his knowledge of Canadian politics. Mackerras's first published study of Australian politics was The Australian Senate 1965-1967: Who Held Control?. He followed this with The 1968 Federal Redistribution (1969). His first major work was Australian General Elections (1972) in which he pioneered the concept of the two-party majority and the two-party swing, and introduced the \\"pendulum\\", a table of federal electorates in order of two-party majority, now commonly known as the Mackerras Pendulum. He followed this with a series of books before each federal election, such as Elections 1975, Elections 1980, The Mackerras 1990 Federal Election Guide and The Malcolm Mackerras 1993 Federal Election Guide. He is commonly described as a psephologist which means \\"one who studies elections\\". However, he insists that his political science interests are much broader than that. Indeed, one of the reasons for his determination on the November‚ÄìDecember 2000 North American visit was to study all the legal manoeuvres in connection with the only \\"cliffhanger\\" presidential election of the 20th century. He visited the US again in September 2004 to attend the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association in Chicago. For the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 he has been specialising in Australian state elections. He visited South Australia in February 2002, Victoria in November‚ÄìDecember 2002 and New South Wales in March 2003 for elections in those states, which involved writing newspaper articles plus broadcasting. He did the same for Queensland where a state election was held on 7 February 2004. He did the same for Australia's federal election on 9 October 2004. Publications His two most recent books are Australian Political Facts: Second Edition (Macmillan, 1997) which he wrote with Ian McAllister and Carolyn Brown Boldiston and, more recently, Constitutional Politics: The Republic Referendum and the Future (University of Queensland Press, 2002), which he edited with John Warhurst of the Australian National University. The two men took opposite sides in the debate over the 1999 Australian republic referendum but have now joined together to record the event. Election commentary Mackerras has been a regular commentator on Australian elections in print, on radio and television on most federal and state elections. He has become well known for his predictions of electoral outcomes. He claims a \\"win\\" ratio of two in three and adds, \\"at least I'm not boring. The election analyst who makes predictions is far more interesting than one who doesn't. And if I collect egg on my face, then so be it.\\" An example of an incorrect prediction was one he made in The Australian of 1 November 2004. Mackerras said that John Kerry would defeat George W. Bush in a \\"landslide\\" in the U.S. presidential election the following day, and specifically predicted that Kerry would carry Florida, Ohio, Nevada and Missouri.

When the Federal Bureau of Investigation started pursuing Poulsen, he went underground as a fugitive. A storage company cleared out a storage shed in Poulsen's name due to nonpayment of rent, where computer equipment was discovered which was furnished to the FBI for evidence. When he was featured on NBC's Unsolved Mysteries, the show's 1-800 telephone lines mysteriously crashed. Poulsen was arrested in April 1991 following an investigation led in part by John McClurg.https://www.itbusiness.ca/news/former-fbi-agent-creates-system-to- predict-insider-threats-at-dell/51944https://ia.acs.org.au/article/2018/turns- out-wargames--nuclear-scenario-is-real.html In June 1994, Poulsen pleaded guilty to seven counts of conspiracy, fraud, and wiretapping. He was sentenced to five years in a federal penitentiary, as well as banned from using computers or the internet for 3 years after his release. He was the first American to be released from prison with a court sentence that banned him from using computers and the internet after his prison sentence. Although Chris Lamprecht was sentenced first with an internet ban on May 5, 1995, Poulsen was released from prison before Lamprecht and began serving his ban sentence earlier. (Poulsen's parole officer later allowed him to use the Internet in 2004, with certain monitoring restrictions). = Journalism = Poulsen has reinvented himself as a journalist since his release from prison and sought to distance himself from his criminal past. Poulsen served in a number of journalistic capacities at California-based security research firm SecurityFocus, where he began writing security and hacking news in early 2000. Despite a late arrival to a market saturated with technology media, SecurityFocus News became a well-known name in the tech news world during Poulsen's tenure with the company and was acquired by Symantec. Moreover, his original investigative reporting was frequently picked up by the mainstream press. Poulsen left SecurityFocus in 2005 to freelance and pursue independent writing projects. In June 2005, he became a senior editor for Wired News, which hosted his blog, 27BStroke6, later renamed Threat Level. In October 2006, Poulsen released information detailing his successful search for registered sex offenders using MySpace to solicit sex from children. His work identified 744 registered people with MySpace profiles and led to the arrest of one, Andrew Lubrano. In June 2010, Poulsen broke the initial story of the arrest of U.S. service member Chelsea Manning and published the logs of Manning's chats with Adrian Lamo regarding WikiLeaks. In June 2019, Poulsen was accused of doxing Shawn Brooks, a 34-year-old Trump supporter living in The Bronx, when Poulsen revealed his identity in an article published in The Daily Beast on June 1, 2019 for being the alleged creator and disseminator of a fake video, which showed Nancy Pelosi speaking in a slurred manner. = SecureDrop = Poulsen, Aaron Swartz, and James Dolan designed and developed SecureDrop, an open-source software platform for secure communication between journalists and sources. It was originally developed under the name DeadDrop. After Swartz's death Poulsen launched the first instance of the platform at The New Yorker, on 15 May 2013. Poulsen later turned over development of SecureDrop to the Freedom of the Press Foundation, and joined the foundation's technical advisory board.

They include: intellectual responsibility, perseverance, open-mindedness, empathy, integrity, intellectual courage, confidence in reason, love of truth, intellectual humility, imaginativeness, curiosity, fair-mindedness, and autonomy. So-called virtue responsibilists conceive of intellectual virtues primarily as acquired character traits, such as intellectual conscientiousness and love of knowledge. Virtue reliabilists, by contrast, think of intellectual virtues more in terms of well-functioning mental faculties such as perception, memory, and intuition. Intellectual virtues are studied extensively in both critical thinking and virtue epistemology.  Aristotle  Aristotle analyzed virtues into moral and intellectual virtues. In the Posterior Analytics and Nicomachean Ethics he identified five intellectual virtues as the five ways the soul arrives at truth by affirmation or denial. These are then separated into three classes: *Theoretical **Sophia ‚Äì wisdom (rational intuition and scientific knowledge directed toward the highest and most valuable objects) **Episteme ‚Äì scientific knowledge of objects that are necessary and unchanging **Nous ‚Äì rational intuition of first principles or self-evident truths *Practical **Phronesis ‚Äì practical wisdom/prudence *Productive **Techne ‚Äì craft knowledge, art, skill Subjacent intellectual virtues in Aristotle: *Euboulia ‚Äì deliberating well, deliberative excellence; thinking properly about the right end. * Sunesis ‚Äì understanding, sagacity, astuteness, consciousness of why something is as it is. For example, the understanding you have of why a situation is as it is, prior to having phronesis. *Gnom√™ ‚Äì judgement and consideration; allowing us to make equitable or fair decisions. *Deinotes ‚Äì cleverness; the ability to carry out actions so as to achieve a goal.

Early life  According to the Velvet Book of Russian genealogy, the Aksakovs trace their male line to ≈†imon, a Varangian nephew of Haakon the Old, who settled in Novgorod in 1027. Their first documented ancestor was Ivan Feodorivich Velyaminov nicknamed Oksak who lived during the 15th century. His family crest was based on the Polish Przyjaciel coat of arms (also known as Aksak) which is considered to be of Tatar origin in Poland (the word ¬´oksak¬ª means ¬´lame¬ª in Turkic languages).Andrei Kuleshov (2009). Aksakovs. The History of Broken Fates. Chapter I: Origins. ‚Äî Moscow: Territory, 328 pages at the official Aksakov family website (in Russian) All this led some researches to believe that the Aksakov family also originated from Tatars, despite they had no relation to the Polish noble house. Sergey was born in Ufa and brought up there and in the family estate at Novo- Aksakovka in Orenburg guberniya, where he acquired a lifelong love of nature. He was also introduced to literature by his mother at an early age, and became especially fond of Kheraskov's Rossiada and the tragedies of Sumarokov. He was educated at the Kazan Gymnasium and then, in 1805 (in the first year after its founding), at Kazan University, though he himself said he was ill-prepared for a university education (and some of the professors, brought from abroad, taught in foreign languages).V. Savodnik, Ocherki po istorii russkoi literatury XIX-go veka, Part II (Kolomea, [1906]), p. 1. He was also distracted by his obsessive interest in the theater.  Career  He left the university in 1807, and the following year went to St. Petersburg to take up government service, for which he was also poorly prepared. Again, he spent considerable time at the theater, and his acquaintance with the conservative Admiral Shishkov strengthened his preference for classical Russian literature and introduced him to the Lovers of the Russian Word. He resigned from the civil service in 1811 and moved to Moscow, where he was active as an amateur in literary and theatrical life and published his first verse anonymously in 1812.John McNair, \\"Sergei Timofeevich Aksakov\\" in Neil Cornwell and Nicole Christian (eds), Reference Guide to Russian literature (Taylor & Francis, 1998: ), p. 97. Aksakov enlisted in the militia and took part in the Campaign of 1812; afterwards he settled for the quiet life of a sporting country squire at his estate of Aksakovo in Orenburg guberniya, where he stayed from 1816 until 1826, after which he was usually in Moscow. In 1816 he married Olga Semenovna Zaplatina, and the couple had six sons and eight daughters. His eldest daughter Vera Aksakova who was born in 1819 was also a noted author. He began publishing translations, reviews, and articles in the early 1820s, though his important work came much later. In 1827 he was appointed to the Moscow Censorship Committee, from which he was dismissed in 1832 for allowing the publication of a \\"scurrilous\\" pamphlet on drunken policemen; in 1833 he became an inspector at the Grand Duke Constantine School of Surveying, and in 1835 the first director of the Constantine Geodetic Institute (Konstantinovsky mezhevoi institut).John McNair, \\"Sergei Timofeevich Aksakov,\\" p. 97. He retired from the civil service in 1838. In 1832 he met Gogol \\"and recognized in him what he had failed to see in P√∫shkin or any other man‚Äîa purely Russian genius. Aks√°kov's house, a stronghold of pure Russianism in Moscow society, became the temple of the cult of G√≥gol, and Aks√°kov its high priest.\\"D.S. Mirsky, A History of Russian Literature (Northwestern University Press, 1999), p. 185. It was Gogol who revealed to Aksakov the possibility of creating literature based directly on life, without forcing it into the mold of classical forms. In 1834 Aksakov published his first realistic story, \\"A Blizzard.\\" Around 1840, encouraged by Gogol, he began writing the book that would make him famous, A Family Chronicle. While he was working on that, he published books about two of his favorite activities since his youth, Notes on Fishing (1847) and Notes of a Hunter in Orenburg Province (1852). Their \\"limpid style and concrete content,\\" which were \\"almost unique in Russian literature,\\" were appreciated by contemporaries;Charles A. Moser in Victor Terras, Handbook of Russian Literature (Yale University Press, 1990: ), p. 17. Turgenev reviewed them enthusiastically, and Gogol wrote Aksakov, \\"Your birds and fishes are more alive than my men and women.\\"Mirsky, History of Russian Literature, p. 186.  Later life  Aksakov garden in Ufa, named in honor of Sergey Aksakov In 1843 Aksakov settled in the village of Abramtsevo, where he entertained writers including Gogol, Turgenev, and Tolstoy and which was also frequented by his Slavophile sons, Konstantin and Ivan. In the late 1850s he published his most enduring works, The Family Chronicle (Semeinaya khronika, 1856; translated as A Russian Gentleman) and Childhood Years of Bagrov Grandson (Detskie gody Bagrova-vnuka, 1858, translated as Years of Childhood). These reminiscences of a childhood spent in a Russian patriarchal family \\"brought Aksakov recognition as a literary artist of the first rank.\\"John McNair, \\"Sergei Timofeevich Aksakov,\\" p. 98. Aksakov's semi-autobiographical narratives are unmatched for their scrupulous and detailed description of the everyday life of the Russian nobility. Among Aksakov's other works are The History of My Acquaintance with Gogol (Istoriya moego znakomstva s Gogolem, published 1890 [written in 1830s and 1840s]); Memoirs (Vospominaniya, 1856, translated as A Russian Schoolboy), and Collecting Butterflies (Sobiranie babochek, 1858).

This is in contrast with an endergonic process. Constant pressure, constant temperature reactions are exergonic if and only if the Gibbs free energy change is negative (‚àÜG < 0). \\"Exergonic\\" (from the prefix exo-, derived for the Greek word ·ºîŒæœâ ex≈ç, \\"outside\\" and the suffix -ergonic, derived from the Greek word ·ºîœÅŒ≥ŒøŒΩ ergon, \\"work\\") means \\"releasing energy in the form of work\\". In thermodynamics, work is defined as the energy moving from the system (the internal region) to the surroundings (the external region) during a given process. All physical and chemical systems in the universe follow the second law of thermodynamics and proceed in a downhill, i.e., exergonic, direction. Thus, left to itself, any physical or chemical system will proceed, according to the second law of thermodynamics, in a direction that tends to lower the free energy of the system, and thus to expend energy in the form of work. These reactions occur spontaneously. A chemical reaction is also exergonic when spontaneous. Thus in this type of reactions the Gibbs free energy decreases. The entropy is included in any change of the Gibbs free energy. This differs from an exothermic reaction or an endothermic reaction where the entropy is not included. The Gibbs free energy is calculated with the Gibbs‚ÄìHelmholtz equation: : \\\\Delta G = \\\\Delta H- T \\\\cdot \\\\Delta S where: : T = temperature in kelvins (K) : ŒîG = change in the Gibbs free energy : ŒîS = change in entropy (at 298 K) as ŒîS = Œ£{S(Product)} ‚àí Œ£{S(Reagent)} : ŒîH = change in enthalpy (at 298 K) as ŒîH = Œ£{H(Product)} ‚àí Œ£{H(Reagent)} A chemical reaction progresses only spontaneously when the Gibbs free energy decreases, in that case the ŒîG is negative.

Because of its location on the Silk Road, it revived over time only to be largely destroyed again in the 19th century by nomadic Teke raiders. Edmund O'Donovan described Merv in 1882 as : ...only a \\"geographical expression.\\" It means a certain amount of cultivated territory where half a million Tekke-Turkomans manage to eke out an existence by pastoral pursuits, plunder, and thievery, combined with the caravan service between Bokhara and Meshed.

He ranked among the pioneers of modernism in American architecture.  Biography  William Lescaze was born in Onex, Switzerland. He studied at the Coll√®ge Calvin and at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, before completing his formal education at the √âcole polytechnique f√©d√©rale de Zurich in Zurich where Karl Moser was a teacher, receiving his degree in 1919. He contributed to the post-war reconstruction effort of Arras, and then immigrated to the US in 1920. He worked for some time at the architectural firm of Hubbell & Benes in Cleveland, Ohio, and taught French during night classes at the YMCA. In 1923, he was offered a modeling job and moved to New York City where he set up his business. His first major work was the design of the Oak Lane Country Day School outside Philadelphia. In 1929, Philadelphia architect George Howe invited William Lescaze to form a partnership, Howe & Lescaze. Within just a few weeks after joining forces, the duo began work on a large project for downtown Philadelphia. The resulting structure, completed in 1932, was the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society (PSFS) Building, which is today generally considered the first International Modernist skyscraper, and the first International Style building of wide significance in the United States. It was also the first building with full air conditioning. Lescaze is generally given credit for the design: letters from Howe to Lescaze quote the former insisting to the latter that \\"the design is definitely yours.\\" The structure replaced the bank's former headquarters in Philadelphia, a classicist structure near Washington Square built in 1897. In 1930, Howe & Lescaze submitted a design for the new building of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The wood and metal model was donated to the MOMA in 1994. In 1935, William Lescaze established his own architecture firm, Lescaze & associates. His 1937 Alfred Loomis house in Tuxedo Park, NY is regarded as an early experiment in double-skin facade construction. In 1939 he designed a futuristic \\"House for 2089\\" which included a helipad on the roof. Lescaze was also the design lead for the 1937 Williamsburg Houses in Brooklyn, a pioneering 20-building modernist housing project modeled on European examples. He later taught industrial design at the Pratt Institute (1943‚Äì1945). Among his built works were the CBS West Coast studios Columbia Square on Sunset Boulevard (1938). William Lescaze also designed the office building at 711 Third Street, the city and municipal courts building in the Civic Center in Manhattan, and the High School of Art and Design. From 1949 to 1959, he served at the State Building Code Commission William Lescaze died on 9 February 1969 of a heart attack at his New York home. He was a proponent of modern architecture, stating it was the only architecture that could solve the housing problem.

Career Wilson joined the Cavaliers after his discharge from Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas, in 1962. The Cavaliers' first chart hit was \\"Last Kiss\\", a song written by Wayne Cochran, who had based the song on a car accident in Barnesville, Georgia, near where he lived. The song, while only garnering minor success for Wayne Cochran and the C.C. Riders, found major success for the Cavaliers. \\"Last Kiss\\" became a hit in June 1964, it reached the top 10 in October of that year, eventually reaching number two on the Billboard Hot 100. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. In October 1964, the British music magazine NME reported that Wilson had himself been involved in an auto accident near Lima, Ohio, in which his 27-year-old record producer, Sonley Roush, was killed, and Wilson was seriously injured. While J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers recorded many more songs, and \\"Last Kiss\\" was subsequently covered successfully by Wednesday and Pearl Jam, the band charted with only one other song, \\"Hey, Little One\\", which reached number 85. Wilson, with or without the Cavaliers, continued to release records until 1978. He started working offshore oilfield in late 1970s and 1980s in the Gulf of Mexico.

It was featured in the special edition Raƒçunari u va≈°oj kuƒáiRaƒçunari u va≈°oj kuƒái (Computers in your home, written by Dejan Ristanoviƒá) of a popular eponymous science magazine, published late December 1983 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Kits were available but not required as it could be built entirely out of standard off-the-shelf parts. It was later also available in complete form.  History  In the early eighties, various laws in SFR Yugoslavia prevented importing computers into the country. At the same time, even the cheapest computers available in the West were nearing average monthly salaries. This meant that regardless of demand for home computers, only a relative minority of people owned one ‚Äì mostly a ZX Spectrum or a Commodore 64. According to his own words, some time in 1983, Voja Antoniƒá, while vacationing in Hotel Teuta in Risan, was reading the application handbook for the RCA CDP1802 CPU and stumbled upon CPU- assisted video generation. Since the CDP1802 was very primitive, he decided that a Zilog Z80 processor could perform the task as well. Before he returned home to Belgrade, he already had the conceptual diagrams of a computer that used software to generate a video picture. Although using software as opposed to hardware would significantly reduce his design's performance, it also simplified the hardware and reduced its cost. His next step was to find a magazine to publish the diagrams in. The obvious choice was SAM Magazine published in Zagreb, but due to prior bad experiences he decided to publish elsewhere. The popular science magazine Galaksija appeared incompatible but he heard that they were working on a special issue dedicated to computers. He proposed publishing entire do-it-yourself diagrams, instructions, etc. to the author of the issue, Dejan Ristanoviƒá. Everything made its way into the special issue called Raƒçunari u va≈°oj kuƒái (Computers in your home). It was released late December 1983, although it was dated January 1984. They tried to guess the number of Galaksijas that would be built by readers. Their estimates ranged from a hundred to a thousand (a number that sounded so optimistic it provoked laughter). The actual number built by known \\"do-it-yourselfers\\" ‚Äì was around 8000! This number may in reality be greater if people who did not purchase any kits (including PCB and ROMs) are accounted for. Components were provided by various manufacturers and suppliers: * MIPRO and Elektronika from Buje, together with Institut za elektroniku i vakuumsku tehniku (en. Institute for electronics and vacuum technology) delivered PCBs, keyboards and masks, * Mikrotehnika from Graz sent integrated circuits * Voja Antoniƒá personally programmed all EPROMs * Galaksija collected requisition forms and organized deliveries Later, Institute for school books and teaching aids together with Elektronika In≈æenjering started mass commercial production of Galaksija computers, mainly to be delivered to schools.  Technical specifications  * CPU: Zilog Z80A 3.072 MHz * ROM \\"A\\" or \\"1\\" ‚Äì 4 KB (2732 EPROM) contains bootstrap, core control and Galaksija BASIC interpreter code * ROM \\"B\\" or \\"2\\" ‚Äì 4 KB (optional, also 2732 EPROM) ‚Äì additional Galaksija BASIC commands, assembler, machine code monitor, etc. * Character ROM ‚Äì 2 KB (2716 EPROM) contains character definitions, characters are 8 x 13 pixels, the block graphics were vertically divided in a 4:5:4 scheme, and horizontally in a 4:4 scheme. * RAM: 2 to 6 KB of 6116 static RAM in base model, expandable to 54 KB * Text mode 32 x 16 characters, monochrome * Pseudographics: 2x3 dot matrix combinations in graphic character subset ‚Äì 64x48 dots total. * Sound: None according to specifications, but tape interface was occasionally used as audio output port ‚Äì like the \\"EAR\\" port on ZX Spectrum can be used both as audio and cassette tape interface. See cassette port for details. * Storage media: cassette tape, recording at 280 bit/s rate * I/O ports: 44-pin edge connector with Z80 Bus, tape (DIN connector), monochrome video out (PAL timings, DIN connector), and UHF TV out (RCA connector)  BASIC ROMs  Galaksija BASIC is a BASIC interpreter originally partly based on code taken from TRS-80 Level 1 BASIC, which the creator believed to have been a Microsoft BASIC. However, after extensive modifications to include video generation code (as the CPU was a major participant to reduce the cost of hardware) and improve the programming language, what remained from the original is said to be mainly flow-control and floating point code. It was fully contained in 4 KB ROM \\"A\\" or \\"1\\". Additional ROM \\"B\\" or \\"2\\" provided more Galaksija BASIC commands, assembler, monitor, etc. = ROM \\"A\\" = The chip labeled as \\"A\\" by the creator of Galaksija, Voja Antoniƒá was commonly referred to as \\"ROM 1\\" or just \\"ROM\\". ROM \\"A\\" contained bootstrap code of Galaksija, its control code (rudimentary operating system), video generation code (as Galaksija did not have advanced video subsystem its Z80 CPU was responsible even for generating video signal) and Galaksija BASIC. Fitting all this functionality in 4 KB of 2732 EPROM required a lot of effort and some sacrifices. For example, some message text areas were also used actual code (e.g. \\"READY\\" message) and the number of error messages was reduced to only three (\\"WHAT?\\", \\"HOW?\\" and \\"SORRY\\"). = ROM \\"B\\" = ROM \\"B\\" of the Galaksija is a 2732 EPROM chip that contains extensions to the original Galaksija BASIC available in base ROM (\\"A\\"). It was labeled as \\"B\\" by the creator of the Galaksija, Voja Antoniƒá, but was commonly referred to as \\"ROM 2\\". ROM \\"B\\" contained added Galaksija BASIC commands and functions (mostly trigonometric) as well as a Z80 assembler and a machine code monitor. This ROM was not required and was an optional upgrade. Although planned on the mainboard, the content of ROM \\"B\\" was not automatically initialized during booting. Instead, users had to execute a Galaksija BASIC command to run a machine code program from ROM \\"B\\" before they can gain additional features. This also meant that even Galaksijas with ROM \\"B\\" plugged in can behave entirely as base models.  Character ROM  Character ROM of home computer Galaksija is a 2716 EPROM chip that contains graphical definitions of Galaksija's character set. It had no special name and was labeled \\"2716\\" after the type of 2 KB EPROM needed. Galaksija had a slightly modified (localized) ASCII character set: * There were no lowercase characters * Codes 91 to 94 represented Serbian language characters ƒå, ƒÜ, ≈Ω and ≈†, respectively. Letter \\"ƒê\\" was not present in original version and was commonly replaced with \\"DJ\\". * It contained 64 pseudo-graphics characters, having different combinations of dots in 2x3 matrix. * Character codes 64 and 39 are used for two-halves of the logo of Elektronika In≈æenjering company (they can be seen in \\"READY\\" prompt) Each character was represented as 8x13 matrix of pixels. In this ROM, 8-pixel rows of each character are represented as 8 bits of one byte.  \\"Cassette\\" port  Galaksija used cassette tape as secondary storage. It featured a 5-pin DIN connector used to connect the computer to a cassette tape recorder. Tape interface circuitry was rudimentary ‚Äì other than few elements controlling the levels it was essentially one-bit digital equivalent to the one in the ZX Spectrum. The input signal was routed to the integrated circuit otherwise responsible for keyboard, so the CPU would \\"see\\" the input signal as a series of very fast key presses of varying lengths and gaps between them. It is normally stated that original Galaksija does not have any dedicated (separate) audio ports and most of the programs were written as silent. It was, however, possible to utilize the cassette tape port as an audio output as well like it is done in ZX Spectrum (its \\"EAR\\" connector). The only technical difference between ZX Spectrum and Galaksija in regards to existence of audio is that ZX Spectrum has a built-in beeper, while Galaksija's plans do not include any kind of a speaker.  Design  To simplify \\"do-it-yourself\\" building and reduce cost, the printed circuit board was designed as single-layer (one-side) board. This resulted in a relatively complicated design requiring many components-side connections to be made using wires. Galaksija's case was not pre-built. Instead, the guide suggested it to be built out of the printed circuit board material (such as Pertinax) also used for the mainboard. Thus, the top, sides and reinforcements were soldered together to form the \\"lid\\". Acrylic glass was recommended for the underside. The guide included instructions on cleaning, painting and even decorating the assembled case. The name \\"GALAKSIJA\\" and decorative border were to be added using Letraset transfer letter sheets after the first (white) coat of paint but before the second coat of final colour. After the paint dried, transferred decorations were supposed to be scratched off, exposing underlying white paint. The keyboard is laid out such that keys have their own memory-mapped addresses that, in most cases, follow the same order as ASCII code of the letter on the key. This saved the ROM space by reducing lookup tables but significantly increased the complexity of single-layer keyboard PCB such that it alone required 35 jumpers.

For example, when a patient anticipates a side effect of a medication, they can suffer that effect even if the \\"medication\\" is actually an inert substance. The complementary concept, the placebo effect, is said to occur when positive expectations improve an outcome. Both placebo and nocebo effects are presumably psychogenic, but they can induce measurable changes in the body. One article that reviewed 31 studies on nocebo effects reported a wide range of symptoms that could manifest as nocebo effects including nausea, stomach pains, itching, bloating, depression, sleep problems, loss of appetite, sexual dysfunction and severe hypotension. Etymology and usage The term nocebo (Latin nocƒìb≈ç, \\"I shall harm\\", from noce≈ç, \\"I harm\\") was coined by Walter Kennedy in 1961 to denote the counterpart to the use of placebo (Latin placƒìb≈ç, \\"I shall please\\", from place≈ç, \\"I please\\"; a substance that may produce a beneficial, healthful, pleasant, or desirable effect). Kennedy emphasized that his use of the term \\"nocebo\\" refers strictly to a subject-centered response, a quality inherent in the patient rather than in the remedy\\". That is, Kennedy rejected the use of the term for pharmacologically induced negative side effects such as the ringing in the ears caused by quinine. That is not to say that the patient's psychologically induced response may not include physiological effects. For example, an expectation of pain may induce anxiety, which in turn causes the release of cholecystokinin, which facilitates pain transmission. Response In the narrowest sense, a nocebo response occurs when a drug-trial subject's symptoms are worsened by the administration of an inert, sham, or dummy (simulator) treatment, called a placebo. According to current pharmacological knowledge and the current understanding of cause and effect, a placebo contains no chemical (or any other agent) that could possibly cause any of the observed worsening in the subject's symptoms. Thus, any change for the worse must be due to some subjective factor. Adverse expectations can also cause the analgesic effects of anesthetic medications to disappear. The worsening of the subject's symptoms or reduction of beneficial effects is a direct consequence of their exposure to the placebo, but those symptoms have not been chemically generated by the placebo. Because this generation of symptoms entails a complex of \\"subject-internal\\" activities, in the strictest sense, we can never speak in terms of simulator-centered \\"nocebo effects\\", but only in terms of subject-centered \\"nocebo responses\\". Although some observers attribute nocebo responses (or placebo responses) to a subject's gullibility, there is no evidence that an individual who manifests a nocebo/placebo response to one treatment will manifest a nocebo/placebo response to any other treatment; i.e., there is no fixed nocebo/placebo-responding trait or propensity. McGlashan, Evans & Orne (1969, p. 319) found no evidence of what they termed a \\"placebo personality\\". Also, in a carefully designed study, Lasagna, Mosteller, von Felsinger and Beecher (1954), found that there was no way that any observer could determine, by testing or by interview, which subject would manifest a placebo reaction and which would not. Experiments have shown that no relationship exists between an individual's measured hypnotic susceptibility and their manifestation of nocebo or placebo responses. Effects =Side effects of drugs= It has been shown that, due to the nocebo effect, warning patients about side effects of drugs can contribute to the causation of such effects, whether the drug is real or not. This effect has been observed in clinical trials: according to a 2013 review, the dropout rate among placebo-treated patients in a meta-analysis of 41 clinical trials of Parkinson's disease treatments was 8.8%. A 2013 review found that nearly 1 out of 20 patients receiving a placebo in clinical trials for depression dropped out due to adverse events, which were believed to have been caused by the nocebo effect. A 2018 review found that half of patients taking placebos in clinical trials report intervention-related adverse events. =Electromagnetic hypersensitivity= Evidence suggests that the symptoms of electromagnetic hypersensitivity are caused by the nocebo effect. =Pain= Verbal suggestion can cause hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain) and allodynia (perception of a tactile stimulus as painful) as a result of the nocebo effect. Nocebo hyperalgesia is believed to involve the activation of cholecystokinin receptors. Ambiguity of medical usage Stewart-Williams and Podd argue that using the contrasting terms \\"placebo\\" and \\"nocebo\\" to label inert agents that produce pleasant, health-improving, or desirable outcomes versus unpleasant, health-diminishing, or undesirable outcomes (respectively), is extremely counterproductive. For example, precisely the same inert agents can produce analgesia and hyperalgesia, the first of which, from this definition, would be a placebo, and the second a nocebo. A second problem is that the same effect, such as immunosuppression, may be desirable for a subject with an autoimmune disorder, but be undesirable for most other subjects. Thus, in the first case, the effect would be a placebo, and in the second, a nocebo. A third problem is that the prescriber does not know whether the relevant subjects consider the effects that they experience to be desirable or undesirable until some time after the drugs have been administered. A fourth problem is that the same phenomena are being generated in all the subjects, and these are being generated by the same drug, which is acting in all of the subjects through the same mechanism. Yet because the phenomena in question have been subjectively considered to be desirable to one group but not the other, the phenomena are now being labelled in two mutually exclusive ways (i.e., placebo and nocebo); and this is giving the false impression that the drug in question has produced two different phenomena. Ambiguity of anthropological usage Some people maintain that belief kills (e.g., \\"voodoo death\\": Cannon (1942) describes a number of instances from a variety of different cultures) and belief heals (e.g., faith healing). A \\"self-willed\\" death (due to voodoo hex, evil eye, pointing the bone procedure, etc.) is an extreme form of a culture-specific syndrome or mass psychogenic illness that produces a particular form of psychosomatic or psychophysiological disorder which results in a psychogenic death. Rubel (1964) spoke of \\"culture bound\\" syndromes, which were those \\"from which members of a particular group claim to suffer and for which their culture provides an etiology, diagnosis, preventive measures, and regimens of healing\\". Certain anthropologists, such as Robert Hahn and Arthur Kleinman, have extended the placebo/nocebo distinction into this realm in order to allow a distinction to be made between rituals, like faith healing, that are performed in order to heal, cure, or bring benefit (placebo rituals) and others, like \\"pointing the bone\\", that are performed in order to kill, injure or bring harm (nocebo rituals). As the meaning of the two inter-related and opposing terms has extended, we now find anthropologists speaking, in various contexts, of nocebo or placebo (harmful or helpful) rituals: * that might entail nocebo or placebo (unpleasant or pleasant) procedures; * about which subjects might have nocebo or placebo (harmful or beneficial) beliefs; * that are delivered by operators that might have nocebo or placebo (pathogenic, disease-generating or salutogenic, health-promoting) expectations; * that are delivered to subjects that might have nocebo or placebo (negative, fearful, despairing or positive, hopeful, confident) expectations about the ritual; * which are delivered by operators who might have nocebo or placebo (malevolent or benevolent) intentions, in the hope that the rituals will generate nocebo or placebo (lethal, injurious, harmful or restorative, curative, healthy) outcomes; and, that all of this depends upon the operator's overall beliefs in the harmful nature of the nocebo ritual or the beneficial nature of the placebo ritual. Yet, it may become even more terminologically complex; for, as Hahn and Kleinman indicate, there can also be cases where there are paradoxical nocebo outcomes from placebo rituals (e.g. the TGN1412 drug trial), as well as paradoxical placebo outcomes from nocebo rituals (see also unintended consequences). Writing from his extensive experience of treating cancer (including more than 1,000 melanoma cases) at Sydney Hospital, Milton (1973) warned of the impact of the delivery of a prognosis, and how many of his patients, upon receiving their prognosis, simply turned their face to the wall and died a premature death: \\"there is a small group of patients in whom the realization of impending death is a blow so terrible that they are quite unable to adjust to it, and they die rapidly before the malignancy seems to have developed enough to cause death. This problem of self-willed death is in some ways analogous to the death produced in primitive peoples by witchcraft ('pointing the bone')\\". Ethics A number of researchers have pointed out that the harm caused by communicating with patients about potential treatment adverse events raises an ethical issue. Informing a patient about what harms a treatment is likely to cause is required to respect autonomy. Yet the way in which potential harms are communicated could cause additional harm, which may violate the ethical principle of non-maleficence. It may be possible that nocebo effects can be reduced while respecting autonomy using different models of informed consent, including the use of a framing effect. In fact, it has been argued that forcing patients to learn about all potential adverse events against their will could violate autonomy.

He was preceded and succeeded by the Social Democratic leader of that time, Jens Otto Krag. Between 1948 and 1951 Baunsgaard had been chairman of The Social Liberal Youth of Denmark. In 1957 he became a Member of Parliament. By 1968 Baunsgaard's party had been a frequent coalition partner of the Social Democrats for the last 15 years. However, after the 1968 elections, he abandoned the Social Democrats and formed a centre-right coalition with the Conservative Party and the Liberal Venstre. The three parties held a clear majority of seats in the parliament. In spite of this, they utterly failed to tackle the growing problems of the welfare state and rein in public spending. As a result, taxation skyrocketed. In the social sphere the government was one of the most radical thus far seen in Denmark, abolishing censorship of pornography and legalising abortion. However, in doing so they alienated sufficient numbers of core supporters to lose the 1971 election, which brought the Social Democrats back to power. Baunsgaard is often credited with being the first major Danish politician to truly embrace TV as the main media for communication with the voters.Siune, Karen (1984). \\"Bestemmer TV valgresultatet?\\" in Elklit, J√∏rgen & Tonsgaard, Ole (eds.)

Although his appearance and style on the screen looks old- fashioned by today's standards, he was way ahead of his contemporaries in politics. He managed to connect with the voters, and was consistently rated as the most trustworthy politician from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s. However, his weak leadership of the government damaged his reputation. He remained as party leader until 1975, and resigned from parliament in 1977. Baunsgaard was the main architect behind Nordek, a proposed organization for Nordic economic cooperation somewhat similar to the EEC (European Economic Community). The idea was embraced by both Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, but ultimately failed since Finland did not join due to its relationship with the Soviet Union, and Denmark joined the EEC.

In 1975, James Harithas (the former director of the Syracusan Everson Museum) hired Lombardi to be an assistant curator at the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston, Texas, where Harithas had become director. Lombardi worked there for approximately two years, until 1976. While in Houston, he also opened a small art gallery, \\"Square One\\".. Then, he became a general reference librarian for the Fine Arts department in the Houston Public Library, started a regional artist archive, and wrote two books, one on the drug wars and another on the neglected and forgotten art genre of panoramas. During this time, Lombardi was also an abstract painter of no particular note; he pursued painting as a hobby during his actual career as an archivist and reference librarian. Late career Six years before his death, Lombardi switched to link analysis pencil diagrams of crime and conspiracy networks that he would become best known for. In the early 1990s, he began researching the many scandals of the time, including the BCCI scandal, the Harken Energy scandal, and the Savings and Loan scandal. The thousands of index cards that he accumulated in the course of this research began to overwhelm his ability to deal with them, and to cope, Mark began assembling them into physical outlines, and then into hand-written diagrams. These were intended to be a tool, to provide focus to his work, but he \\"...soon decided that this method of combining text and image in a single field (called a drawing, diagram or flow chart, whichever you prefer) really worked for me in other ways as well.\\" This decision was spurred, according to Lombardi, while he was talking with a friend about one of the participants in the Iran‚ÄìContra scandal, Adnan Khashoggi. Regarding this conversation, Lombardi wrote \\"I began taking notes, then sketching out a simple tree chart, showing the breakdown of Khashoggi's American holdings. Within days, I began making more of these charts, depicting other corporate networks I had researched. I was writing several pieces at the time and found the charts a useful, quick reference to the material at hand.\\" Initially, as the subject of one of his manuscripts, the primary focus was on the drug wars, but because of Pete Brewton's January 1990 newspaper series about the Houston S&L; scandal, in which Brewton alleged that the Bush family, CIA members, and Mafia members took part in a de facto conspiracy to steal vast sums of money, Lombardi shifted his emphasis to investigating the laundering of the stolen money. Lombardi divorced in October 1996, and moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn at the urging of his friend Fred Tomaselli. There, he participated in a group show at the Drawing Center, called Selections: Winter 1997, followed by two solo art shows: Silent Partners, shown in November 1998 at Pierogi 2000 in Brooklyn,. and Vicious Circles, a work drawing upon Jonathan Kwitny's book of the same name dealing with Mafia involvement in the legitimate commercial markets, shown in 1999 at the Devon Golden Gallery in Chelsea. Mark was included in Versus IV - a Willoughby Sharp curated group effort juxtaposing five American artists (including John Drury, Neil Frankl, Alan Skarritt and Duff Schweninger in addition to Lombardi) with eight Europeans in Torino, Italy - also in 1998, where two of his drawings including \\"Neil Bush and Silverado #2\\" (1996) were printed in the accompanying catalogue. He also participated in another group show, Greater New York: New Art in New York Now in February 2000 at the P.S. 1 art gallery. In March 2000, on the day before his death, Lombardi moved all his work to Pierogi 2000. He then bolted his apartment from the inside and hanged himself, on the day before his birthday and three years after he had moved to Williamsburg. Works Cover art for Mark Lombardi: Global Networks. The cover reproduces a detail from Lombardi's \\"George W. Bush, Harken Energy and Jackson Stephens, ca 1979‚Äì90\\". Lombardi called his diagrams Narrative Structures. They are structurally similar to sociograms ‚Äì a type of graph drawing used in the field of social network analysis, and to a lesser degree by earlier artists like Hans Haacke. Other important influences on Lombardi were philosopher Herbert Marcuse, and visualization expert Edward Tufte.Hobbs, Robert (2003). Excerpt from Global Networks catalog discussing the influence of Edward Tufte on Lombardi posted at Tufte's website. Robert Hobbs, one of the independent curators who organized and wrote the explanatory prose for \\"Global Networks\\", corroborates that both the FBI and Homeland Security were interested in the drawings. You talked about the FBI agent who came to look at Lombardi's work after 9/11, yesterday [before the opening of posthumous Lombardi show \\"Global Networks\\"], Yesterday members of homeland security asked to come and see the exhibition before it opened. Having a work of art that a government agency is looking at to verify certain facts is incredibly fascinating. They were intrigued by how Lombardi was presenting and dealing with the information. In Lombardi's historical diagrams, each node or connection was drawn from news stories from reputable media organizations, and his drawings document the purported financial and political frauds by power brokers. According to Hobbs, who faced the overwhelming task of fact-checking Lombardi: \\"Certain things that are listed in the drawing are in red. These represent court judgments, actual dollar amounts. That is verifiable information. And I think that Lombardi himself realized that not everything could be verified. So I think what you have instead is names. We know about connections of names. Exactly what is that connection is hard to characterize. So that is a line with an arrow in one direction, or an arrow in two directions. So it's really the abstract component of the work of art. It's what can be represented, and ‚Äì really ‚Äì what cannot be represented.\\" For instance, his 1999 drawing \\"George W. Bush, Harken Energy, and Jackson Stephens, ca 1979‚Äì90\\" shows alleged connections between James Bath, the Bush and bin Laden families, and business deals in Texas and around the world. Following Lombardi's suicide in 2000, the book Mark Lombardi: Global Networks was written in conjunction with a traveling exhibit. The editors chose to incorporate into the cover artwork (see image at right) a detail from \\"George W. Bush, Harken Energy, and Jackson Stephens, ca 1979‚Äì90\\", showing George W. Bush (on the back cover of the book) and Osama bin Laden (in the upper left of the front cover) separated by one step from each other in the network, via Bath; the same connection between Bush and bin Laden was also highlighted in a 2003 Boston Globe article that described the FBIs interest in Lombardi's works immediately following the September 11 attacks of 2001..

Posthumous exhibits A major exhibit of Lombardi's art, \\"Mark Lombardi: Global Networks,\\" was organized by Independent Curators International and curated by Robert Hobbs. The exhibit traveled to nine museums over 2003‚Äì2005, and has been the subject of several reviews.. Review of \\"Global Networks\\" at the Drawing Center, New York, 2003..

Several of Lombardi's works were included in a 2010 show, NineteenEightyFour, hosted by the Austrian Cultural Forum New York. A re- exhibition of his work was held at the Pierogi Gallery in 2011 which, in addition to his drawings, included his bookshelf and a vitrine displaying some of his reference materials, as well as a 1996 video of Lombardi interviewed by Andy Mann... 20 of Lombardi's drawings are in the permanent collection of MoMA.Holdings of Lombardi artwork in MOMA, retrieved 2012-04-14.

In 2012, German director Mareike Wegener released a documentary on Lombardi, entitled Mark Lombardi: Death-Defying Acts Of Art And Conspiracy. The movie premiered in May 2012 in Germany and the Brooklyn Film Festival,. and then opened in September at MoMA in New York.. Reviewers of the movie suggested that, unlike Lombardi's own work, it relies too much on innuendo and too little on factual information,. and that it focuses too much on testimonials from friends and does not adequately explain the impact of Lombardi's art..

He was the first-born son of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka from his wife Devi and the elder brother of Sanghamittha. Mahinda was sent as a Buddhist missionary to the Anuradhapura Kingdom in Sri Lanka. Mahinda obtained the title of an arhat and resided at Mihintale. He played an important role in proliferating Buddhism throughout the Indian subcontinent.  Historical sources  Mihindu (Mahinda in Pali) Seya at Rajagala, the place where the inscription commemorating saint Mahinda was found The Dipavansa and the Mahavansa, Sri Lanka's two great religious chronicles, contain accounts of Mahinda travelling to Sri Lanka and converting King Devanampiyatissa. These are the primary sources for accounts of his life and deeds. Inscriptions and literary references also establish that Buddhism became prevalent in Sri Lanka around the 3rd century BCE, the period when Mahinda lived. The inscription in Rajagala monastery confirm the fact that Thera Mahinda came to Sri Lanka to propagate Buddhism and lived there until his death. The Mahavamsa says that Mahinda, the son of Ashoka, came to Sri Lanka and that Ashoka's daughter became a nun and brought the Bodhi Tree. Though Ashoka wanted his prodigal eldest son Mahendra to succeed him and made several attempts to bring him out of renunciation, due to the orthodox Hindu community's refusal to accept a Buddhist Crown Prince from a Vaishya mother as well as Majhendra's own lack of enthusiasm to take over an empire, he gave up. Though texts describe Mahendra's motive in leaving for Sri Lanka as spiritual, historians have argued that it was more of a political motive. Ashoka had feared that Mahendra would be killed just like Sushima, so to keep him safe and to avoid any succession war, he sent him to Sri Lanka. The party left from Vedasagiri vihara, believed to be modern day Sanchi. Mahavamsa and Dipavamsa, the chronicles of Sri Lanka, record the arrival of the party on the full moon of Jettha, a national festival. At the time, King Devanampiyatissa was participating in a hunting expedition in the Mihintale hills. It is said that Ashoka and Devanampiyatissa were previously acquainted and on good terms, having exchanged royal gifts upon their respective ascensions to the throne. Upon meeting the shaven-headed monks Devanampiyatissa was taken aback by their appearance and asked who they were. After exchanging greetings, Mahinda preached the Chulahatthipadopama Sutra, and the royal hunting party converted to Buddhism. The party was subsequently invited to Anuradhapura, the seat of the throne for a royal reception and to give further dharma talks. Mahinda subsequently gave two public talks sanctioned by Devanampiyatissa, in the Royal Hall and in the Nandana garden in the Royal Park, leading to the start of the public embrace of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. The royal park Mahamegha was then set aside as the residence for Mahinda's party, and in later times became the Mahavihara, the earliest centre of Buddhist culture and scholarship Sri Lanka. The Chetiyagirivihara monastery was then established in Mihintale. Mahinda then sent for his sister Sanghamitta from Magadha, who was a nun, to start a female Buddhist order after local women had expressed a desire to join the Sangha. Mahinda also arranged for a bodhi sapling from the original tree in Bodh Gaya to be sent to Sri Lanka, where it was planted in the grounds of the Mahavihara and is still visible today. After a month spent delivering discourses to Sri Lankans who had ventured to the capital, Mahinda retreated to Mihintale to spend the vassa during the monsoon season. As a result, a second royal funded monastery was built there. Later, Mahinda organised for a stupa to be constructed, and a part of the bodily relics of Gautama Buddha were transferred from the Maurya Empire to Sri Lanka. Mahinda then had Arittha, Devanampiyatissa's nephew, a bhikkhu, expound the Vinaya monastic code of discipline to further Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Mahinda outlived Devanampiyatissa, and died at the age of 80 in Sri Lanka. King Uttiya, who succeeded his brother, organized a state funeral for Mahinda and constructed a stupa to house his relics at Mihintale.  Significance and legacy  The 20th century Sri Lankan monk Walpola Rahula described Mahinda as \\"the father of Sinhalese literature\\" as he had translated and written commentary for the Tripitaka in Sinhala, turning it into a literary language. He was also credited with introducing the culture of the Mauryan empire to the island, along with its architecture. More recently, Suwanda H J Sugunasiri, a Canadian scholar, has identified him as the Redactor of the oldest Buddhapuja in the world (247 BCE).s Mihintale, the mountain where Mahinda supposedly first encountered King Devanampiyatissa and the site of his funerary stupa, is an important pilgrimage site in Sri Lanka. Pilgrimages are traditionally undertaken in the month of June (Poson in the old Sinhala calendar), when Mahinda is believed to have arrived in Sri Lanka on the full-moon night of the month, a traditional time for religious observances in Theravada Buddhism.

The lines represent tectonic plate boundaries. Continental and oceanic crust on the upper earth mantle Oceanic crust is the uppermost layer of the oceanic portion of a tectonic plate. It is composed of the upper oceanic crust, with pillow lavas and a dike complex, and the lower oceanic crust, composed of troctolite, gabbro and ultramafic cumulates.Gillis et al (2014). Primitive layered gabbros from fast-spreading lower oceanic crust. Nature 505, 204-208 The crust overlies the solidified and uppermost layer of the mantle. The crust and the solid mantle layer together constitute oceanic lithosphere. Oceanic crust is primarily composed of mafic rocks, or sima, which is rich in iron and magnesium. It is thinner than continental crust, or sial, generally less than 10 kilometers thick; however, it is denser, having a mean density of about 3.0 grams per cubic centimeter as opposed to continental crust which has a density of about 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter. The crust uppermost is the result of the cooling of magma derived from mantle material below the plate. The magma is injected into the spreading center, which consists mainly of a partly solidified crystal mush derived from earlier injections, forming magma lenses that are the source of the sheeted dikes that feed the overlying pillow lavas. As the lavas cool they are, in most instances, modified chemically by seawater.H. Elderfield (2006). The Oceans and Marine Geochemistry. Elsevier. pp. 182‚Äì. . These eruptions occur mostly at mid-ocean ridges, but also at scattered hotspots, and also in rare but powerful occurrences known as flood basalt eruptions. But most magma crystallises at depth, within the lower oceanic crust. There, newly intruded magma can mix and react with pre-existing crystal mush and rocks.Lissenberg, C. J., MacLeod, C. J., Horward, K. A., and Godard, M. (2013). Pervasive reactive melt migration through fast-spreading lower oceanic crust (Hess Deep, equatorial Pacific Ocean). Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 361, 436‚Äì447. doi: 10.1016/j.epsl.2012.11.012 Composition Although a complete section of oceanic crust has not yet been drilled, geologists have several pieces of evidence that help them understand the ocean floor. Estimations of composition are based on analyses of ophiolites (sections of oceanic crust that are thrust onto and preserved on the continents), comparisons of the seismic structure of the oceanic crust with laboratory determinations of seismic velocities in known rock types, and samples recovered from the ocean floor by submersibles, dredging (especially from ridge crests and fracture zones) and drilling.Kodaira, S., Noguchi, N., Takahashi, N., Ishizuka, O., & Kaneda, Y. (2010). Evolution from fore‚Äêarc oceanic crust to island arc crust: A seismic study along the Izu‚ÄêBonin fore arc. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, 115(B9), N/a. Oceanic crust is significantly simpler than continental crust and generally can be divided in three layers. According to mineral physics experiments, at lower mantle pressures, oceanic crust becomes denser than the surrounding mantle.Li, M., & McNamara, A. (2013). The difficulty for subducted oceanic crust to accumulate at the Earth's core‚Äêmantle boundary. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, 118(4), 1807-1816. * Layer 1 is on an average 0.4 km thick. It consists of unconsolidated or semiconsolidated sediments, usually thin or even not present near the mid-ocean ridges but thickens farther away from the ridge.Peter Laznicka (2 September 2010). Giant Metallic Deposits: Future Sources of Industrial Metals. Springer Science & Business Media. pp. 82‚Äì. . Near the continental margins sediment is terrigenous, meaning derived from the land, unlike deep sea sediments which are made of tiny shells of marine organisms, usually calcareous and siliceous, or it can be made of volcanic ash and terrigenous sediments transported by turbidity currents.D. R. Bowes (1989) The Encyclopedia of Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology, Van Nostrand Reinhold * Layer 2 could be divided into two parts: layer 2A ‚Äì 0.5 km thick uppermost volcanic layer of glassy to finely crystalline basalt usually in the form of pillow basalt, and layer 2B ‚Äì 1.5 km thick layer composed of diabase dikes.Yildirim Dilek (1 January 2000). Ophiolites and Oceanic Crust: New Insights from Field Studies and the Ocean Drilling Program. Geological Society of America. pp. 506‚Äì. . * Layer 3 is formed by slow cooling of magma beneath the surface and consists of coarse grained gabbros and cumulate ultramafic rocks.Gillis et al (2014). Primitive layered gabbros from fast-spreading lower oceanic crust. Nature 505, 204-208 It constitutes over two-thirds of oceanic crust volume with almost 5 km thickness.Jon Erickson (14 May 2014). Plate Tectonics: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Earth. Infobase Publishing. pp. 83‚Äì. . =Geochemistry= The most voluminous volcanic rocks of the ocean floor are the mid-oceanic ridge basalts, which are derived from low-potassium tholeiitic magmas. These rocks have low concentrations of large ion lithophile elements (LILE), light rare earth elements (LREE), volatile elements and other highly incompatible elements. There can be found basalts enriched with incompatible elements, but they are rare and associated with mid-ocean ridge hot spots such as surroundings of Galapagos Islands, the Azores and Iceland.Clare P. Marshall, Rhodes W. Fairbridge (1999) Encyclopedia of Geochemistry, Kluwer Academic Publishers Prior to the Neoproterozoic Era 1000 Ma ago as world's oceanic crust was more mafic than present-days'. The more mafic nature of the crust meant that higher amounts of water molecules (OH) could be stored the altered parts of the crust. At subduction zones this mafic crust was prone to metamorphose into greenschist instead of blueschist at ordinary blueschist facies. =Life cycle= Oceanic crust is continuously being created at mid- ocean ridges. As plates diverge at these ridges, magma rises into the upper mantle and crust. As it moves away from the ridge, the lithosphere becomes cooler and denser, and sediment gradually builds on top of it. The youngest oceanic lithosphere is at the oceanic ridges, and it gets progressively older away from the ridges. As the mantle rises it cools and melts, as the pressure decreases and it crosses the solidus. The amount of melt produced depends only on the temperature of the mantle as it rises. Hence most oceanic crust is the same thickness (7¬±1 km). Very slow spreading ridges (<1 cm¬∑yr‚àí1 half-rate) produce thinner crust (4‚Äì5 km thick) as the mantle has a chance to cool on upwelling and so it crosses the solidus and melts at lesser depth, thereby producing less melt and thinner crust. An example of this is the Gakkel Ridge under the Arctic Ocean. Thicker than average crust is found above plumes as the mantle is hotter and hence it crosses the solidus and melts at a greater depth, creating more melt and a thicker crust. An example of this is Iceland which has crust of thickness ~20 km.C.M.R. Fowler (2005) The Solid Earth (2nd Ed.), Cambridge University Press The age of the oceanic crust can be used to estimate the (thermal) thickness of the lithosphere, where young oceanic crust has not had enough time to cool the mantle beneath it, while older oceanic crust has thicker mantle lithosphere beneath it. The oceanic lithosphere subducts at what are known as convergent boundaries. These boundaries can exist between oceanic lithosphere on one plate and oceanic lithosphere on another, or between oceanic lithosphere on one plate and continental lithosphere on another. In the second situation, the oceanic lithosphere always subducts because the continental lithosphere is less dense. The subduction process consumes older oceanic lithosphere, so oceanic crust is seldom more than 200 million years old.Condie, K.C. 1997. Plate Tectonics and Crustal Evolution (4th Edition). 288 page, Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd. The process of super-continent formation and destruction via repeated cycles of creation and destruction of oceanic crust is known as the Wilson cycle. The oldest large-scale oceanic crust is in the west Pacific and north-west Atlantic ‚Äî both are about up to 180-200 million years old. However, parts of the eastern Mediterranean Sea are remnants of the much older Tethys ocean, at about 270 and up to 340 million years old. Magnetic anomalies The oceanic crust displays a pattern of magnetic lines, parallel to the ocean ridges, frozen in the basalt. A symmetrical pattern of positive and negative magnetic lines emanates from the mid-ocean ridge. New rock is formed by magma at the mid-ocean ridges, and the ocean floor spreads out from this point. When the magma cools to form rock, its magnetic polarity is aligned with the then- current positions of the magnetic poles of the Earth. New magma then forces the older cooled magma away from the ridge. This process results in parallel sections of oceanic crust of alternating magnetic polarity.

Dharmarak·π£ita (Sanskrit \\"Protected by the Dharma\\", Pali Dhammarakkhita), was one of the missionaries sent by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka to proselytize Buddhism. He is described as being a Greek (Pali: Yona, lit. \\"Ionian\\") in the Mahavamsa, and his activities are indicative of some Hellenistic Greek following during the early centuries of Buddhism. Greek communities had been present in neighbouring Bactria and in northwestern India since the time of the conquests of Alexander the Great around 323 BCE, and developed into the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom until the end of the 1st century BCE. Greeks were generally described in ancient times throughout the Classical world as \\"Yona\\", \\"Yonaka\\", \\"Yojanas\\" or \\"Yavanas\\", lit. ‚ÄúIonians\\". They were ardent recipients of Buddhism and the example of Dharmarak·π£ita indicates that they even took an active role in spreading Buddhism as leading missionaries. A Greek Buddhist missionary The efforts of Emperor Ashoka to spread the Buddhist faith are described in the Edicts of Ashoka carved during his reign on stone pillars and cave walls: : \\"Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the Kambojas, the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in Dhamma.\\" Rock Edict Nb13 (S. Dhammika) Ashoka also claimed to have sent emissaries beyond his borders, as far as the Greek kings of the Mediterranean: :\\"Now it is conquest by Dhamma that Beloved- of-the-Gods considers to be the best conquest. And it (conquest by Dhamma) has been won here, on the borders, even six hundred yojanas away, where the Greek king Antiochos rules, beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the Cholas, the Pandyas, and as far as Tamraparni.\\" Rock Edict Nb13 (S. Dhammika) Dharmaraksita is then described in important Buddhist Pali historical texts, the Dipavamsa and the Mahavamsa, as being a Greek Buddhist missionary, in charge of propagating the faith to the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. :\\"When the thera Moggaliputta, the illuminator of the religion of the Conqueror, had brought the (third) council to an end (‚Ä¶) he sent forth theras, one here and one there: :* The thera Mahyantika he sent to Kasmira and Gandhara, :* The thera, Mahadeva he sent to Mahisamandala. :* To Vanavasa be sent the thera named Rakkhita, :* and to Aparantaka (he sent) the Yona named Dhammarakkhita; :* to Maharattha (he sent) the thera named Mahadhammarakkhita, :* but the thera Maharakkhita he sent into the country of the Yona. :* He sent the thera Majjhima to the Himalaya country, :* and to Suvambhurni he sent the two theras Sona and Uttara. :* The great thera Mahinda, the theras Utthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddasala his disciples, these five theras he sent forth with the charge: \`Ye shall found in the lovely island of Lanka the lovely religion of the Conqueror.'\\" (Mahavamsa, XII) The country of Aparantaka has been identified as the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, and comprises Northern Gujarat, Kathiawar, Kachch, and Sindh, the area where Greek communities were probably concentrated. Dharmarashita is said to have preached the Aggikkhandopama Sutra, so that 37,000 people were converted in Aparantaka and that thousands of men and women entered the Order (\\"pabbajja\\"): :\\"The thera Dhammarakkhita the Yona, being gone to Aparantaka and having preached in the midst of the people the Aggikkhandhopama-sutta gave to drink of the nectar of truth to thirty-seven thousand living beings who had come together there, lie who perfectly understood truth and untruth. A thousand men and yet more women went forth from noble families and received the pabbajja\\" (Mahavamsa XII, Dipavamsa. VIII.7) Dharmaraksita and Punabbasukutumbikaputta Tissa Thera In another Pali reference, a Buddhist monk from Sri Lanka named Punabbasukutumbikaputta Tissa Thera is said to have been to India in order to study with \\"the Yonaka Dhammarakkhita\\", whereupon he attained the \\"patisambhida\\" (analytical knowledge). (VibhA.389, Sammoha-Vinodan√≠, Vibhanga Commentary). The place where Dharmaraksita resides is also said to be around 100 leagues (around 700 miles) from Sri Lanka, putting it somewhere in northern India. (See: ) Dharmaraksita and the Milinda Panha The Milinda Panha is another famous non-canonical Pali Buddhist text that describes the religious dialogues between the famous Indo-Greek king Menander, whose kingdom was in Sagala in today's Punjab, and a Buddhist monk called Nagasena, around 160 BCE. It is today one of the texts of reference of Theravada Buddhism. According to the Milinda Panha (I 32-35), the monk Nagasena, before his encounter with Menander, was once a student of Dharmaraksita and learnt Buddhism and reached enlightenment as an arhat under his guidance in Pataliputra. This event took place roughly a hundred years after the missionary efforts of Ashoka, and it would suggest that Dharmaraksita was a young man under Ashoka, became a respected elder settled in the Ashokan capital of Pataliputra, and then trained a young Nagasena in the Tripi·π≠aka and towards enlightenment, before Nagasena himself met Menander at a venerable age. The Milinda Panha therefore seems to relate the dialogue between a great Greek king, Menander I, with a monk trained in Buddhism by the great Greek Buddhist elder Dharmaraksita, tending to suggest the importance of Greeks during the first formative centuries of Buddhism.

Since the establishment of the practice by composers like C.P.E. Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert and the codification of this practice into teaching and theory, the practice of writing works in sonata form has changed considerably.  Late Baroque era (ca 1710 ‚Äì ca 1750)  Properly speaking, sonata form did not exist in the Baroque period; however, the forms which led to the standard definition did. In fact, there is a greater variety of harmonic patterns in Baroque works called sonatas than in the Classical period. The sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti provide examples of the range of relationships of theme and harmony possible in the 1730s and 1740s. Sonatas were at first written mainly for the violin. Over time, a formal type evolved, predominating until the late 18th century. This type reached its peak in the sonatas of J.S. Bach, Handel, and Tartini, who followed older Italian models and employed a type attributable to masters such as Corelli and Vivaldi (Musical Form, Leichtentritt, Hugo, p. 122). By the 1730s and 1740s, the direction of instrumental works, often considered less important than vocal music, tended towards an overall two-part layout: the binary form. But a section of contrasting material which served as a bridge between them also came to be included.  Classical era (ca 1750 ‚Äì ca 1825)  The older Italian sonata form differs considerably from the later sonata in the works of the Viennese Classical masters. Between the two main types, the older Italian and the more \\"modern\\" Viennese sonata, various transitional types are manifest in the middle of the 18th century, in the works of the Mannheim composers, Johann Stamitz, Franz Xaver Richter, C.P.E. Bach, and many others. The piano sonata had its inception with Johann Kuhnau, the predecessor of J.S. Bach as cantor of Saint Thomas' Church in Leipzig. Kuhnau was the first to imitate the Italian violin sonata in clavier music. The clavier sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti form a separate and distinct species, written mostly in one movement, in song form, and in homophonic style. Scarlatti's sonatas represent a transitional type between the older and the Viennese sonata. In Italy, a distinction was made in older times between the sonata da chiesa (church sonata), written in fugal style, and the sonata da camera (chamber sonata) which was really a suite mixed with sonata elements, not derived from the dance. The crucial elements that led to the sonata form were the weakening of the difference between binary and ternary form; the shift of texture away from full polyphony (many voices in imitation) to homophony (a single dominant voice and supporting harmony); and the increasing reliance on juxtaposing different keys and textures. As different key relationships took on a more and more specific meaning, the schematics of works altered. Devices such as the false reprise fell out of favor, while other patterns grew in importance. Quite probably the most influential composer on the early development of sonata form was C.P.E. Bach, a son of J.S. Bach. Taking the harmonic and voice-leading techniques that his father had developed, he applied them to the homophonic style ‚Äì allowing dramatic shifts in key and mood, while maintaining an overall coherence. C.P.E. Bach was a decisive influence on Joseph Haydn. One of C.P.E. Bach's most lasting innovations was the shortening of the theme to a motif, which could be shaped more dramatically in pursuit of development. By 1765, C.P.E. Bach's themes, rather than being long melodies, had taken on the style of themes used in sonata form: short, characteristic, and flexible. By linking the changes in the theme to the harmonic function of the section, C.P.E. Bach laid the groundwork that composers such as Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart would exploit. The practice of the great Classical masters, specifically Haydn and Mozart, forms the basis for the description of the sonata form. Their works served both as the model for the form, and as the source for new works conceived in the sonata form itself. Debates about sonata form therefore reference the practice of Haydn and Mozart extensively. Joseph Haydn is thought of as \\"the Father of the Symphony\\" and \\"the Father of the String Quartet\\". He can also be thought of as the father of the sonata form as a means of structuring works. His string quartets and symphonies in particular display not merely the range of applications of the form, but also the way to exploit its dramatic potential. It is predominantly Haydn who created the transition to the development and the transition to the recapitulation, as moments of supreme tension and dramatic interest. It is also Haydn who enabled a more expansive contour for works, by making every aspect of the harmony of a work implicit in its main theme. This is no small innovation, in that it creates a homophonic analog to the polyphonic fugue ‚Äì a seed of potential from which the composer could later germinate a range of different effects. Haydn's variety of dramatic effects and ability to create tension was remarked upon in his own time: his music was increasingly taken as the standard by which other practice might be judged. Haydn's set of string quartets, Op. 33 gives the first examples of coordinated use of the resources of sonata form in characteristic fashion. The composer himself listed them as being written on completely new principles and marking the turning point in his technique. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart applied the large- scale ideas of Haydn to opera and the piano concerto. Mozart's fluidity with the creation of themes, and the dense network of motives and their parts give his work a surface polish which was remarked upon even by his professional rivals. Mozart favored sonata form and the sonata cycle. Most of his compositions were in sonata cycle. He explored every genre of his day and perfected them all. By the end of his short life, Mozart had absorbed Haydn's technique and applied it to his own more elongated sense of theme, for example in the Prague Symphony.  Romantic period (ca 1825 ‚Äì ca 1910)  Ludwig van Beethoven was the composer who most directly inspired the theorists who codified sonata form as a particular practice. While he was grounded in the fluid phrase structures and wider variety of possible schematic layouts that came from Haydn and Mozart, his deepest innovation was to work from both ends of a sonata form, conceiving of the entire structure, and then polishing themes which would support that overarching design. He continued to expand the length and weight of the sonata forms used by Haydn and Mozart, as well as frequently using motives and harmonic models drawn from the two older composers. He shares both the Classical and Romantic eras. Because of his use of increasingly characteristic rhythms and disruptive devices, he is seen as a transitional figure between the Classical and Romantic periods. In the Romantic era, sonata form was first explicitly defined and became institutionalized. Academic scholars like Adolph Bernhard Marx wrote descriptions of the form, often with a normative goal; that is, a goal of stating how works in sonata form should be composed. While the first-movement form had been the subject of theoretical works, it was seen as the pinnacle of musical technique. Part of the training of 19th-century composers was to write in sonata form and to favor sonata form in the first movement of multi- movement compositions, like symphonies, piano concertos, and string quartets. The 19th century's procedure for writing sonatas diverged from earlier Classical practice, in that it focused more on themes than on the placement of cadences. The monothematic exposition (a common characteristic of Haydn's sonata-form movements) largely disappeared, and the themes of the first and second groups were expected to contrast in character. More generally, the formal outline of a sonata came to be viewed more in terms of its themes or groups of themes, rather than the sharp differentiation of tonal areas based on cadences. In the Classical period, establishing the expectation of a particular cadence and then delaying or avoiding it was a common way of creating tension. In the 19th century, with its dramatically expanded harmonic vocabulary, avoidance of a cadence did not have the same degree of unexpectedness. Instead, more distant key regions were established by a variety of other means, including use of increasingly dissonant chords, pedal points, texture, and alteration of the main theme itself. In the Classical period, the contrast between theme groups, while useful, was not required. The first theme group tended to outline the tonic chord, and the second theme tended to be more cantabile in character. But this was far from universal ‚Äì as Haydn's monothematic expositions and Beethoven's early rhythmic themes show. Because the power of harmonic opposition, both between tonic and dominant and between major and minor, had less force in the Romantic vocabulary, stereotypes of the character of themes became stronger. Nineteenth-century theorists described the sonata principle as one of opposition between two groups of themes. Thus, it was thought by Marx that the first theme should be \\"masculine\\" ‚Äì strident, rhythmic, and implying a dissonance ‚Äì and the second theme group should be drawn more from vocal melody making it \\"feminine\\". It is this contrast between \\"rhythmic\\" and \\"singing\\" that Wagner, in his very influential work On Conducting, argued was at the very core of tension in music . This led to the belief among many interpreters and composers that texture was the most important contrast and that tempo should be used to emphasize this contrast. Thus, fast sections were conducted faster and slower sections were conducted or played more slowly. By requiring that harmony move with the themes, 19th-century sonata form imposed a kind of discipline on composers and also allowed audiences to comprehend the music by following the appearance of recognizable melodies. However, the sonata form, as an inherited formal mold, also created a tension for Romantic composers between the desire to combine poetical expression and academic rigor. Later Romantic commentators and theorists detected a \\"sonata idea\\" of increasing formalization. They drew a progression of works from Haydn, through Mozart and Beethoven, whereby more and more movements in a multi-movement work were felt to be in sonata form. These theorists present the theory that originally only first movements were in that form, then later last movements as well (for example Mozart's Prague Symphony), and eventually the \\"sonata principle\\" came to extend through an entire work. For example Beethoven's String Quartet Op. 59 No. 2 was said to have all four movements in sonata form. By this, theorists such as Donald Tovey meant the academically laid-out sonata form. Charles Rosen has argued that, properly understood, this was always the case: that real sonata forms (plural) were always present, though this is not universally agreed on. As the 19th century progressed, the complexity of sonata form grew, as new ways of moving through the harmony of a work were introduced by Johannes Brahms and Franz Liszt. Instead of focusing exclusively on keys closely related in the circle of fifths, they used movement along circles based on minor or major triads. Following the trend established by Beethoven, the focus moved more and more to the development section. This was in line with the Romantic comparison of music to poetry. Poetic terms, such as \\"rhapsody\\" and \\"tone poem\\", entered music, and increasingly musicians felt that they should not take the repeats in symphonies because there was no dramatic or lyrical point to doing so. This changed their interpretation of previous sonata forms. The Romantic sonata form was an especially congenial mold for Brahms, who felt a strong affinity with the composers of the Classical era. Brahms adopted and extended Beethoven's practice of modulating to more remote keys in the exposition, combining this with the use of counterpoint in the inner voices. For example, his piano quintet has the first subject in F minor, but the second subject is in C sharp minor, an augmented fifth higher. In the same work, the key scheme of the recapitulation is also altered ‚Äì the second subject in the recapitulation is in F sharp minor, rather than the F minor of the first subject. Another force acting on sonata form was the school of composers centering on Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. They sought to integrate more roving harmonies and unprepared chords into the musical structure in order to attain both formal coherence and a full, expressive range of keys. Increasingly, themes began to have notes which were far from the original key, a procedure later labeled \\"extended tonality\\". This trend strongly influenced the next generation of composers, for instance Gustav Mahler. The first movements of several of his symphonies are described as being in sonata form, although they diverge from the standard scheme quite dramatically. Some have even argued that the entirety of his first symphony (in which material from the first movement returns in the fourth movement) is meant to be one massive sonata-allegro form. As the result of these innovations, works became more sectional. Composers such as Liszt and Anton Bruckner even began to include explicit pauses in works between sections. The length of sonata movements grew starting in the 1830s. Franz Lachner 's Prize Symphony, a work seldom played today, had a first movement longer than any symphonic first movement by Beethoven. The length of whole works also increased correspondingly. Tone poems, which were often in sonata form, greatly extended their length in comparison to traditional overtures. For instance, Berlioz's Waverley Overture is as long as some middle-period Haydn symphonies. One debate in the 19th century was over whether it was acceptable to use the layout of a poem or other literary work to structure a work of instrumental music. The compositional school focused around Liszt and Wagner (the so-called New German School) argued in favor of literary inspiration (see Program music), while another camp, centered on Schumann, Brahms, and Eduard Hanslick argued that pure music should follow the forms laid out by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. This conflict was eventually internalized, and by 1900, though the debate still raged, composers such as Richard Strauss would freely combine programmatic and symphonic structure, such as in the work Ein Heldenleben.  Modern era  In the Modern period, sonata form became detached from its traditional harmonic basis. The works of Schoenberg, Debussy, Sibelius and Richard Strauss emphasized different scales other than the traditional major- minor scale and used chords that did not clearly establish tonality. It could be argued that by the 1930s, sonata form was merely a rhetorical term for any movement that stated themes, took them apart, and put them back together again. However, even composers of atonal music, such as Roger Sessions and Karl Hartmann, continued to use outlines that clearly pointed back to the practice of Beethoven and Haydn, even if the method and style were quite different. At the same time, composers such as Sergei Prokofiev, Benjamin Britten, and Dmitri Shostakovich revived the idea of a sonata form by more complex and extended use of tonality. In more recent times, Minimalism has searched for new ways to develop form, and new outlines which, again, while not being based on the same harmonic plan as the Classical sonata, are clearly related to it. An example is Aaron Jay Kernis's Symphony in Waves from the early 1990s.

He pitched for four teams: the Los Angeles Dodgers, Montreal Expos, New York Yankees, and Texas Rangers. A relief pitcher, Wetteland specialized as a closer, recording 330 saves during his career. With the Yankees, he won the 1996 World Series over the Atlanta Braves and won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award for saving four games in the series. After his playing career, he served as a coach for the Washington Nationals and Seattle Mariners. In 2019, Wetteland was arrested and indicted on charges of sexually abusing a child under the age of 14. Playing career Wetteland attended Cardinal Newman High School in Santa Rosa, California. The New York Mets selected him in the 12th round of the 1984 MLB draft, but he opted not to sign, feeling he was not ready for a professional career. He enrolled at the College of San Mateo. The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Wetteland as their second choice in the secondary phase of the 1985 MLB draft, and he signed with Los Angeles. In 1986, Wetteland played for the Bakersfield Dodgers of the Class A California League, but struggled, pitching to a 0‚Äì7 win-loss record in 15 games, and was demoted to the Great Falls Dodgers of the Rookie-level Pioneer League. The Detroit Tigers selected Wetteland from the Dodgers in the 1987 Rule 5 draft, but was returned to the Dodgers during spring training in 1988, when they chose to carry Jim Walewander with their final roster spot. In 1988, Wetteland pitched for the San Antonio Missions of the Class AA Texas League. While playing in the Pacific Coast League, he garnered notice by earning 20 saves in 20 chances. He made his major league debut on May 31, 1989. After struggling with his first five starts in 1990, Wetteland asked to become a relief pitcher. After the 1991 season, Wetteland was traded twice; first to the Cincinnati Reds with Tim Belcher for Eric Davis and Kip Gross in November, and then to the Montreal Expos with Bill Risley for Dave Martinez, Scott Ruskin, and Willie Greene in December. In 1992, he became the Expos' closer. On April 5, 1995, the Expos traded Wetteland to the New York Yankees for Fernando Seguignol. During the 1996 season, he led the American League in saves, totaling 43, and appeared in the All-Star Game. During the 1996 World Series, Wetteland recorded four saves and the Yankees won the World Series against the Atlanta Braves in six games. Wetteland won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, recording the maximum four saves possible during the Series, tying the record for the most saves in a single postseason series (Dennis Eckersley first did it in the 1988 ALCS; since then, Greg Holland matched it in the 2014 ALCS), and setting a record for saves in the full postseason, with 7 (since then, Robb Nen, Troy Percival, Brad Lidge, Koji Uehara, and Holland, share this record). He was awarded with the 1996 Rolaids Relief Man Award. The Yankees allowed Wetteland to leave as a free agent due to the emergence of Mariano Rivera. He joined the Texas Rangers on December 16, 1996, signing a four-year contract worth $23 million. Before the 1999 season, Wetteland underwent elbow surgery. The surgery robbed him of some of his fastball speed, forcing him to expand his repertoire to include a slider, curveball, and change-up. Wetteland was again named to the All-Star team for the 1999 season, where he pitched a scoreless 9th inning, and became the first Rangers pitcher to earn an All-Star save. His 43 saves that year set a new Rangers record. His final game was on September 20, 2000, and he retired at age 33 after his Rangers contract expired during the 2000 offseason. Wetteland was awarded the Rolaids Reliever of the Decade after earning the most saves of any pitcher during the 1990s. He is also the Rangers all-time saves leader with 150. His final win/loss percentage was .516, with 48 wins and 45 losses. In 2005, Wetteland was inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame. Coaching career The Washington Nationals hired Wetteland as their bullpen coach on January 27, 2006. However, on June 15, 2006, Wetteland was relieved of his duties due to a request from manager Frank Robinson, due to a \\"long line of transgressions and insubordination\\". He was offered another position within the organization. Wetteland was announced as the bullpen coach for the Seattle Mariners on December 3, 2008. He served in this position until after the end of the 2010 season, when new manager Eric Wedge replaced him with Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers pitching coach Jaime Navarro.  Personal life  Wetteland grew up in a log cabin in Sebastopol, California. His father, Ed, played baseball in the Chicago Cubs organization. Wetteland and his ex-wife Michele met while he was playing for San Antonio in 1988. Through his relationship with Michelle, who became a born-again Christian at age six, Wetteland also became born again. They separated in 2014. Their divorce by state decree was final in 2015. They have four children. On May 18, 2007, Wetteland was introduced as an assistant baseball coach and Bible teacher at Liberty Christian School in Argyle, Texas. On November 12, 2009, Wetteland was hospitalized for what was originally said to be a \\"mental issue,\\" in which a woman reported he was depressed and contemplating suicide. In subsequent statements upon Wetteland's release the same night, Wetteland and the Seattle Mariners indicated that the cause of the hospitalization was \\"because of an extremely high heart rate\\" linked to high blood pressure. On January 15, 2019, Wetteland was arrested in Texas on child sex abuse charges due to allegations of \\"continuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14.\\" Wetteland is accused of abusing a male relative between the ages of four and six by forcing him to perform a sex act on Wetteland on three occasions, between October 2004 and October 2006. Wetteland was released from jail on $25,000 bond. A grand jury in Denton County, Texas indicted him on the charges in March.

Muto returned to New Japan in 1986, where he was nicknamed \\"Space Lone Wolf\\", a space-age type character that was briefly revived in 2005 by NOSAWA Rongai. IWGP Tag Team Champion (1987‚Äì1988) In March 1987, Muto won the IWGP Tag Team Championship with Shiro Koshinaka, before losing the titles to Akira Maeda and Nobuhiko Takada six days later. In the summer of 1987, Muto took part in the NOW vs. NEW feud, in which he aligned himself with Antonio Inoki and his group, teaming with the likes of Inoki, Seiji Sakaguchi, Yoshiaki Fujiwara, and Kantaro Hoshino, and battling the likes of Tatsumi Fujinami, Riki Choshu, Akira Maeda, Kengo Kimura, and Super Strong Machine. =Excursion to Puerto Rico and Texas (1988‚Äì1989)= In January 1988, Muto went on another excursion, this time in Puerto Rico for the Capitol Sports Promotions (CSP) under his new ring name, \\"The Super Black Ninja\\". He feuded with Miguel Perez Jr., with whom he lost a hair vs. hair match to that April. It was in Puerto Rico he formed The Three Musketeers with Masahiro Chono and Shinya Hashimoto. He wrestled only one match in New Japan during this period on July 29, before returning to Puerto Rico. In the fall of 1988, Muto moved to the Dallas, Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling, where he reunited with Kendo Nagasaki and had a very short lived feud with Kevin Von Erich before departing the organization in March 1989. Muto's personality and ring skills shown in his early American matches earned him a high billing within the National Wrestling Alliance. =World Championship Wrestling (1989‚Äì1990)= Muto first appeared as \\"The Great Muta\\" in the NWA's World Championship Wrestling territory on the March 18, 1989, edition of Saturday Night, although announcer Jim Ross pronounced the name as \\"The Great Muto\\". His manager Gary Hart introduced him as the son of the Great Kabuki, whom Gary Hart also had managed years earlier. He defeated Cougar Jay in his debut match. Muta would feud with stars like Lex Luger, Ric Flair, and Sting, from whom he would capture the NWA World Television Championship on September 3, 1989. Muto eventually lost the championship to Arn Anderson on January 2, 1990, which aired on the January 12, 1990, edition of Power Hour, and some time after the Clash of the Champions X on February 6, Muto would return to New Japan, going between his real name and his Muta gimmick as he pleased. =Return to NJPW= Rise to prominence (1990-1992) Muto quickly rose in the ranks upon returning to New Japan in March 1990. He made his in-ring return to NJPW on April 27 by teaming with Masahiro Chono to defeat Shinya Hashimoto and Masa Saito to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship, marking Muto's second reign with the title. He and Chono would hold the titles for over six months, before finally losing them to Hiroshi Hase and Kensuke Sasaki on November 1. During this time, Muto also entered the Kyushu Cup tournament on June 12, in which he defeated Chono to advance to the finals of the tournament, where he lost to Hashimoto. On September 7, Muto introduced his Great Muta moniker for the first time in NJPW during a match against Samurai Shiro, which Muto won. Muto would occasionally perform the Muta gimmick for major matches while competing under his real name for regular matches. On September 30, Muta picked up a huge win over Ricky Steamboat. Muto revived his Great Muta moniker at the WCW and NJPW-jointly promoted Starrcade in Tokyo Dome event on March 21, 1991, where he defeated Sting. Later that year, Muto and Chono, along with Hashimoto, cemented their status as the next generation of New Japan, surpassing Antonio Inoki, Tatsumi Fujinami, and Riki Choshu, after the finals of the first G1 Climax tournament on August 11. He lost to Scott Norton but defeated Tatsumi Fujinami and Big Van Vader in his block to advance to the final against Chono, which turned out to be an epic thirty-minute match in which Muto was bested by Chono and, together with Hashimoto, the three celebrated in the ring, then afterwards they were officially labeled \\"The Three Musketeers\\" of New Japan Pro- Wrestling. In October, Muto paired with Hiroshi Hase to participate in the 1991 Super Tag League, where they lost three of their tournament matches and won three, narrowly missing the chance to qualify for the knockout stage. However, shortly after the tournament, the duo found success as they defeated Rick Steiner and Scott Norton to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship at Budokan Hall on November 5. On January 4, 1992, Muto headlined the Super Warriors in Tokyo Dome event as Great Muta by teaming with Sting for the first time ever to defeat The Steiner Brothers at the Tokyo Dome. This was the first January 4 Tokyo Dome Show, which would become the flagship event for NJPW in years to come. At the NJPW 20th Anniversary Show on March 1, Muto and Hase lost the IWGP Tag Team Championship to Big Van Vader and Crusher Bam Bam Bigelow. Muto continued to rise as a singles competitor, gaining his first title shot at the prestigious IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Riki Choshu on May 17, which he failed to win. Muto participated in the 1992 G1 Climax for the vacant NWA World Heavyweight Championship, defeating Barry Windham in the opening round in Shizuoka on August 6 and Steve Austin in the quarterfinals on August 10, before losing to the eventual winner Masahiro Chono in the semi-finals on August 11. IWGP Heavyweight Champion (1992-1996) On August 16, Muto, donned his Great Muta persona to beat Japanese legend Riki Choshu to win the Greatest 18 Club Championship and the IWGP Heavyweight Championship for the first time, thus winning the first world championship of his professional wrestling career. He successfully defended both titles against Shinya Hashimoto on September 23 and then retired the Greatest 18 Club Championship to focus on defending the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. He successfully defended the title against Scott Norton on October 18 and Sting on November 22. On December 14, Muta faced Hiroshi Hase in a winning effort in a famous match where Hase used a foreign object to beat at Muta's forehead, as payback for their previous encounters, including the September 14, 1990, encounter, in which Muta busted Hase open. Muta bladed and cut very deeply into his forehead. As a result of this, Muta bled profusely for the rest of the match, and to this day he still bears scars from where he sliced. On January 4, 1993, Muta defeated Masahiro Chono in a title versus title match at Fantastic Story in Tokyo Dome (known in North America as WCW/New Japan Supershow III) to retain the IWGP Heavyweight Championship and win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, thus becoming the second of the only two men to hold both titles at the same time, the first being Tatsumi Fujinami. After losing the NWA title in WCW, Muta had a variety of challengers in title matches and exhibitions throughout the year. He lost to Hulk Hogan at Wrestling Dontaku in May and then successfully defended his IWGP title against The Great Kabuki on June 15. After holding the title for longer than a year, Muta finally lost the title to Shinya Hashimoto on September 20. Following this title loss and a match with Hogan against the Hell Raisers (Hawk Warrior and Power Warrior) on September 23, Muto returned to fighting primarily under his real name, reviving the Muta name for certain matches. On December 10, Muto received a rematch against Hashimoto for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, which he failed to win. Muto resumed teaming with Hiroshi Hase in the fall of 1993 and the duo wrestled the Steiner Brothers in a losing effort at Battlefield on January 4, 1994. Muto reprised his Great Muta moniker for a dream match against the legendary Antonio Inoki at May's Wrestling Dontaku, which Muta lost. In October, Muto and Hase entered the Super Grade Tag League, where they lost only two matches in the tournament, winning rest of their matches and scored fourteen points, thus advancing to the finals on October 30, where they defeated Masahiro Chono and Super Strong Machine to win the tournament, thus earning an IWGP Tag Team Championship opportunity against Hell Raisers on November 25, which Muto and Hase won, thus marking their second reign as a team and Muto's fourth individual tag title reign. They successfully defended the titles against Steiner Brothers in their first title defense at Battle 7 on January 4, 1995. On February 3, Muto lost to Scott Norton in a #1 contender's match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. However, Muto received an opportunity for the title against Shinya Hashimoto at Wrestling Dontaku on May 3, where he defeated Hashimoto to capture his second IWGP Heavyweight Championship and subsequently vacated the IWGP Tag Team Championship three days later on May 6 to focus on defending the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Muto successfully defended the title against Hiroyoshi Tenzan on June 14 and Hawk Warrior on July 13, before winning the G1 Climax in August, beating Hashimoto in the finals to become the first of two men to win the G1 Climax as IWGP Heavyweight Champion as Kensuke Sasaki would achieve this feat in 2000. Muto held the IWGP title throughout the rest of the year. On September 25, Muto successfully defended the title against Junji Hirata. He would then lead New Japan in the opening battles of the feud with Nobuhiko Takada and the UWF-i army, defeating Takada in his fourth title defense on October 9. Muto closed the year with his fifth successful title defense against Shiro Koshinaka on December 11. Muto finally lost the title to Takada at Wrestling World on January 4, 1996. nWo Japan (1996-2000) The latter half of 1996 had Muto pitted against Masahiro Chono's Ookami Gundan, which eventually blossomed into a war with the Chono-led nWo Japan. In the process, Muto began teasing at a possible turn to the side of the nWo, proclaiming himself to be the true successor to Antonio Inoki's legacy, and \\"accidentally\\" attacking his own partners in the middle of a match. During this period, Muto underwent a long slump in big matches, losing not only to members of the nWo, but fellow New Japan wrestlers including Power Warrior at Wrestling World on January 4, 1997, and Shinya Hashimoto for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship on June 5. The turn was teased many times. Muto would even wear an nWo shirt only to proclaim days later that he refused to join Chono's army. Muto further raised confusion by playing both sides of the feud; fighting as a member of New Japan under his real name, and as The Great Muta in nWo Japan, before being The Great Muta full-time for several months in 1997. The full turn came in September 1997, when Muto, after teasing a turn on his nWo teammates, double-crossed Kensuke Sasaki and Kazuo Yamazaki, sealing away the Muta name and formally joining nWo Japan as himself. Almost immediately following this, he and Chono dominated the tag team scene in NJPW, defeating Yamazaki and Sasaki for their second IWGP Tag Team Championship reign as a duo on October 19, and spray-painting the plates of the belts black as a show of disrespect for the championship's legacy. They continued their dominance in the tag team division by winning the Super Grade Tag League by defeating Manabu Nakanishi and Shinya Hashimoto in the final on December 8. On January 4, 1998, Muto headlined Final Power Hall in Tokyo Dome as he unsuccessfully challenged Kensuke Sasaki for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Muto and Chono were forced to vacate the IWGP Tag Team Championship on April 21, when Muto injured his knees, as his years of using the moonsault press were finally catching up to him. During this time, he took a hiatus from action, returning just before the 1998 G1 Climax, from which he was eliminated by Genichiro Tenryu in the first round. Despite his return, Muto was plagued by this nagging injury, fighting through his pain throughout the rest of 1998 and all of 1999. Towards the end of 1998, Muto took the leadership of nWo Japan, after Chono suffered a neck injury and was out of action, turning the nWo into a face stable. Muto would then team with teammate Satoshi Kojima as they won the Super Grade Tag League by defeating Shinya Hashimoto and Tatsumi Fujinami in the final on December 6. At Wrestling World on January 4, 1999, Muto defeated one of Chono's right-hand men, Scott Norton to win his third IWGP Heavyweight Championship. The following month, Masahiro Chono returned to NJPW and disagreed with Muto over Muto's philosophy and leadership of the nWo Japan, thus leaving the group and Muto feuded with Chono for the name of the nWo, which evolved into a war between the nWo, led by Muto, Hiroyoshi Tenzan, and Satoshi Kojima and Chono's new Team 2000 unit, with himself, Don Frye, Super J, and others from the old generation of the nWo. Muto successfully defended the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Kensuke Sasaki at St. Valentine's Day Massacre, Team 2000 member Don Frye at Strong Style Symphony, Genichiro Tenryu on May 5 and Satoshi Kojima on July 20. In August, Muto entered the G1 Climax, where he lost only one match to Tatsumi Fujinami while winning the rest of his matches in the block thus qualifying to the final against Manabu Nakanishi, which he lost, leading to a match between Muto and Nakanishi for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at Final Dome, where Muto retained. Muto revived Great Muta character at Jingu Climax on August 28 for a No Rope Explosive Barbed Wire Barricade Explosive Land Mine Double Hell Deathmatch against Great Nita, which Muta won. The following month, Muto entered the Super Grade Tag League with stablemate Scott Norton, which they won by defeating Manabu Nakanishi and Yuji Nagata in the final. On December 10, Muto finally lost the IWGP Heavyweight Championship to Genichiro Tenryu. The war between Chono and Muto was lost by Muto at the 2000 Wrestling World event as he was defeated by Chono. Muto took an extended hiatus to rehabilitate his damaged knees after that, focusing instead on one last run in America for WCW, thus marking the dissolution of nWo Japan as it merged into Chono's Team 2000. Bad Ass Translate Trading (2001-2002) Muto in 2008 After a planned tag team match with FMW's Hayabusa for Wrestling World 2001 was cancelled due to Hayabusa's injury to both his elbows that required reconstructive surgery, it seemed as if Muto reached a confusing crossroads in his career; however, he chose to completely change his image, shaving his head bald (he had a pronounced receding hairline throughout much of 2000), growing out a goatee, and aligning himself with a fellow NJPW wrestler who had gone overseas for an extended period of time, Shinjiro Otani. The two returned to New Japan on January 4, 2001, at Wrestling World, making short work of Manabu Nakanishi and Jushin Liger. Shortly after, Muto also began appearing for All Japan Pro Wrestling, where he debuted at King's Road New Century by defeating Taiy≈ç Kea. On March 18, Muto debuted his new trademark move, the Shining Wizard to defeat Kazunari Murakami. Since its creation, it has become an extremely popular move on both sides of the Pacific, used by Muto's allies, rivals, and fans of his work. Muto would frequently begin appearing in both New Japan and All Japan, which led to Muto creating a new stable with Don Frye and Shinjiro Otani which later came to be known as BATT (Bad Ass Translate Trading). Added to their ranks were Taiy≈ç Kea of All Japan Pro Wrestling and Jinsei Shinzaki of Michinoku Pro Wrestling. Muto defeated AJPW's veteran Toshiaki Kawada in a dream match at Champion Carnival One Night Special on April 14. At Super Force Group Declaration, Muto defeated Hiroshi Hase, then a member of All Japan, which led to Hase joining BATT as well. 2001 proved to be Muto's year of renewal besides the formation of a new unit, as he challenged, and defeated Genichiro Tenryu for All Japan's coveted Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship on June 8. Muto successfully defended the title against Steve Williams in his first title defense on July 14. Muto would then enter the 2001 G1 Climax, where he won all matches in his block, with the exception of a loss to Satoshi Kojima, thus qualifying for the semi-final on August 11, in which he defeated Tadao Yasuda and then lost to Yuji Nagata in the final a day later. Muto would then defend the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship for the first time in New Japan against Scott Hall on September 23, which Muto retained. Muto and Hase would then lose to Yuji Nagata and Jun Akiyama at Indicate of Next. Muto captured more gold by winning All Japan's World Tag Team Championship alongside stablemate Taiy≈ç Kea by defeating Genichiro Tenryu and Yoji Anjo on October 22. Muto would then successfully defend the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship against Masahiro Chono at an All Japan event on October 27. The following day, at a New Japan event, Muto and Kea defeated Osamu Nishimura and Tatsumi Fujinami in a title versus title match to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship as well, thus giving Muto a total of six belts at one time. Muto and Kea would win that year's Real World Tag League by defeating Mitsuya Nagai and Toshiaki Kawada in the final. Muto closed out the year with a successful title defense of the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship against Tatsumi Fujinami at a New Japan event on December 11. Muto wrestled his last match as a member of the New Japan roster at Wrestling World on January 4, 2002, where he alongside his teammate Hiroshi Hase defeated Osamu Nishimura and Tatsumi Fujinami. Muto would then defect full-time to All Japan, which led to him and Kea being stripped off the IWGP Tag Team Championship on February 2. =Return to WCW= Sporadic appearances (1990-1999) Meanwhile, in World Championship Wrestling, it was announced on Clash of the Champions XIII that The Great Muta would be returning at Starrcade '90 to team with Mr. Saito. Less than a month later Muto teamed with Saito in the Pat O'Connor Memorial Tag-Team Tournament at Starrcade. The duo defeated The New Zealand Militia in the quarterfinals, then Victor Zangiev and Salmon Hasimikov (representing the USSR) in the semi- finals. Muta and Saito were defeated by then US Tag Team Champions The Steiner Brothers in the finals.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw90.htm Muta continued to make sporadic appearances within WCW during 1991 while wrestling regularly in New Japan. He was shown in attendance at WrestleWar 91, and then defeated old rival Sting at the combined New Japan/WCW Starrcade event on March 21, 1991, in Tokyo, Japan. Muto was entered into a match with United States Heavyweight Champion Lex Luger to determine the Number One Contender for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. On June 12 at Clash of the Champions XV, Muta was pinned by Luger to earn the right to challenge Ric Flair at The Great American Bash '91. He went on to wrestle several house shows that month before returning to Japan.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw91.htm In May he returned again to WCW and began appearing on house shows in tag-team matches with Nikita Koloff against Big Van Vader and Rick Rude.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw92.htm He returned to television on the May 30 episode of WCW Saturday Night, defeating Brad Armstrong in a best of three contest. On June 7 Muta was pinned by Scott Steiner at a house show at the Omni in Atlanta, GA. He finished out his short run facing Larry Zybysko on successive house shows, then returned to New Japan. On December 25, he returned to WCW to begin another short stint, losing to Sting in a non-title match in Jacksonville, Florida. He wrestled Sting again on the house show circuit, as well as Steve Austin. On December 28 he made his fourth successive Starrcade appearance, teaming with Barry Windham to defeat Brian Pillman and 2 Cold Scorpio. Later that night Muta eliminated Windham to win the Starrcade 92 BattleBowl. On April 17, 1994, Muto returned to WCW to face Stunning Steve Austin at Spring Stampede for the WCW United States Championship. Austin defeated him by disqualification. This would be his last US appearance for nearly a year, and he would not return until February 19, 1995, when he was shown in the crowd at SuperBrawl IV. He returned to WCW on May 21, 1995, to defeat Paul Orndorff at Slamboree '95. Dark Carnival (2000) After suffering a knee injury in early 2000, Muto took a hiatus from NJPW and returned to WCW in mid-2000 to team with Vampiro. Due to the bad booking and the decline of WCW in its last years, however, Muto could not recapture the previous popularity he had in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He returned to television on the July 11, 2000, episode of WCW Thunder and teamed with The Jung Dragons against Three Count and Tank Abbott. A week later he appeared on Nitro, defeating Vampiro in the quarterfinals of the United States Heavyweight Championship tournament. Later that night he was pinned by Mike Awesome in the semifinals.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw00-01.htm He won the WCW World Tag-Team Championship with Vampiro at New Blood Rising against KroniK. They lost it the next night on Nitro against the team of Rey Mysterio and Juventud Guerrera. His last WCW match came at a house show on September 23, 2000, in Lubbock, TX against Sting. After leaving WCW, a no-compete clause in his WCW contract prevented him from competing in the World Wrestling Federation. =All Japan Pro Wrestling= Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion (2002-2003) Muto as The Great Muta in November 2009 On January 11, 2002, following the end of a year-long cross-promotional angle with New Japan Pro- Wrestling, Keiji Muto shocked the Japanese wrestling world by defecting to All-Japan as a full-time competitor, taking Satoshi Kojima and Kendo Kashin with him. In his first match as an AJPW contracted wrestler, Muto and Taiyo Kea successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship against Mike Barton and Jim Steele on January 14. Muto would then lose the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship to Toshiaki Kawada on February 24. In April, Muto participated in the 2002 Champion Carnival, where he lost only two matches in his block while winning the rest of his matches and thus advancing to the knockout stage on April 10, where he defeated Satoshi Kojima in the semi-final and Mike Barton in the final to win the tournament. Three days later, at Grand Champion Carnival, Muto faced Genichiro Tenryu in a match for the vacant Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship after Kawada was forced to vacate the title due to injury. Muto lost the match. The following month, on May 12, Muto teamed with George Hines and Kaz Hayashi as the trio won the Giant Baba Six- Man Cup tournament. On July 17, Muto and Kea lost the World Tag Team Championship to KroniK. At the Nippon Budokan on July 20, Muto wrestled as three different characters on the card: \\"Kokushi Muso\\", defeating Kaz Hayashi on the second match, himself in a six-man tag team match in the mid-card, and in the second-to-last match, he defeated Satoshi Kojima, under his \\"Great Koji\\" persona, as The Great Muta. On September 30, during an All Japan 30th Anniversary party at the famed Tokyo City Hotel, Mokoto Baba officially announced Muto's appointment as the new president of All Japan, transferring all of the Baba family stock to him. Despite this position, however, Muto continued to wrestle full-time for the promotion. At Royal Road 30 Giant Battle In Budokan Final Battle on October 27, Muto under his Great Muta moniker, defeated Genichiro Tenryu to win his second Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. The following month, he lost to Bob Sapp in a non-title match at Wrestle-1. Muto then entered the Real World Tag League alongside Animal Warrior but failed to advance in the tournament.

On January 19, Muto teamed with Goldberg to defeat KroniK in a tag team match, which led to KroniK being injured in the match and being forced to retire. On February 23, Muta lost the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship to Shinya Hashimoto. Various feuds and title reigns (2003-2008) Shortly after his title loss, Muto entered the 2003 Champion Carnival, defeating John Tenta in the quarter-final but lost to Arashi in the semi-final. On June 8, Muto teamed with Arashi to participate in a tournament for the vacant World Tag Team Championship, which they won by defeating Gigantes and The Gladiator in the semi-final and Jimmy Yang and Satoshi Kojima in the final. On July 13, Muto failed to become the #1 contender for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship by losing to Toshiaki Kawada.

On December 27, Muto made a return to the United States, wrestling for the Ring of Honor promotion as part of an interpromotional All Japan vs. ROH card, which hosted a series of cross- promotional \\"dream\\" matches. In the main event, Muto reverted to his Great Muta persona and teamed with Arashi to defeat Prophecy members Christopher Daniels and Dan Maff. Muto and Arashi finally lost the tag titles to Kaz Hayashi and Satoshi Kojima on January 18, 2004. Muto would then support AJPW in its feud with Roughly Obsess and Destroy and spent most part of the fall of 2003 and 2004 by competing in several matches against RO&D; members. Muto found success in 2004 by entering that year's Champion Carnival, which he won by defeating Takao Omori in the semi-final and Kensuke Sasaki in the final on April 20.

On March 10, 2006, Muto revived his Great Muta moniker as he unsuccessfully challenged Satoshi Kojima for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. Muto failed in the 2006 Champion Carnival and continued his feud with Voodoo Murders throughout the year. At the end of the year, Muto was paired with Toshiaki Kawada in the 2006 Real World Tag League, where they tied Satoshi Kojima and Hiroyoshi Tenzan with eight points in the round robin stage, which led to a match between the two teams on December 2 to determine the final round opponents for the top-ranked team in the tournament, RO'Z and Suwama. Muto and Kawada lost their match. On December 15, Muto teamed with Kannazuki to defeat Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Akimasa Haraguchi to become the inaugural F-1 Tag Team Champions. He made his British debut on January 12, 2007, wrestling for Real Quality Wrestling at the York Hall in Bethnal Green, London, England, where he defeated RQW Heavyweight Champion Martin Stone in a non-title match.

In March, Muto participated in the 2007 Champion Carnival, competing in Block A and finishing with 6 points total; Muto defeated Toshiaki Kawada in the finals on March 30, winning the tournament for a third time. Around that time, while Muto was in Orlando, Florida, in order to establish a working agreement between All Japan and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), he made an appearance for the company, under his Great Muta gimmick, at the Destination X pay-per-view, in a segment with Christian Cage. In February 2009 Muto was featured in multiple interview segments, taped in Japan, where he spoke of his student Akira Raijin, who had just begun working for TNA. At Pro-Wrestling Love In Yokohama, Muto unsuccessfully challenged Minoru Suzuki for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. In the fall of the year, Muto and his partner Joe Doering participated in the 2007 Real World Tag League, which they won by defeating Satoshi Kojima and Suwama in the final on December 9. This earned them a title shot for the World Tag Team Championship against Kojima and TARU on January 3, 2008, which Muto and Doering won. In April, Muto entered the 2008 Champion Carnival, winning only two matches and failing to advance in the round robin stage. Muto and Doering lost the World Tag Team Championship to Minoru Suzuki and Taiyo Kea after a five-month reign on June 28. Dual world champion (2008-2009) Muto had won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in NJPW earlier in 2008 and successfully defended the title in All Japan against Hirooki Goto at Pro-Wrestling Love in Ryogoku Vol. 5. On September 29, Muto wrestled as The Great Muta as he defeated Suwama to capture the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship for the third time, becoming only the second wrestler, after Satoshi Kojima, to hold the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship and the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at the same time. Muta successfully defended the title against Minoru Suzuki at Pro-Wrestling Love in Ryogoku Vol. 6. Muto closed out the year with an unsuccessful stint in the 2008 Real World Tag League alongside Ryota Hama. In 2009, Muto took part in a tournament for the vacant All Asia Tag Team Championship by teaming with Kaz Hayashi, defeating Ryota Hama and Shuji Kondo in the quarter-final before losing to Minoru Suzuki and Nosawa Rongai in the semi-final. On March 14, Muto defended his Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship against Yoshihiro Takayama. He bloodied him severely, as is his trademark, and even used the Shining Wizard to his opponent on the barricade. During the course of the match, however, his mask was ripped off, and he was bleeding profusely. Towards the end of the match, Takayama dominated Muta, but Muta reversed a kick into a Dragon Screw, and attempted to use the Asian Mist against him, but Takayama blocked it, and performed an Everest Suplex Pin on Muta, and won the match. Muta subsequently walked away in shock of what had happened. Following the title loss, Muto participated in the 2009 Champion Carnival, where he won four out of five matches in his block, losing only to Kaz Hayashi. As a result, Muto advanced to the semi-final of the tournament, where he lost to Minoru Suzuki. Muto would spend the entire year representing All Japan in matches against Voodoo Murders, Tokyo Gurentai and F4. In November, Muto teamed with Masakatsu Funaki to participate in the 2009 Real World Tag League. The duo won the tournament by defeating Masayuki Kono and Suwama. World Tag Team Champion (2010-2011) The 2009 Real World Tag League win earned Muto and Masakatsu Funaki, a title match for the World Tag Team Championship against Minoru Suzuki and Taiyo Kea on January 3, 2010, which Muto and Funaki won. On January 30, Muto, under his Great Muta gimmick, made a special appearance for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla in Los Angeles, California, during the WrestleReunion 4 weekend, teaming up with Kai in a match, where they defeated the team of Joey Ryan and Scott Lost.

At Pro-Wrestling Love In Ryogoku Vol. 12, Muto and KENSO defeated SMOP (Akebono and Ryota Hama) to win the World Tag Team Championship, marking Muto's fifth and final reign with the title. At All Together, Muto teamed with Kenta Kobashi to defeat Takashi Iizuka and Toru Yano in a tag team match. On October 23, Muto and KENSO lost the World Tag Team Championship to Dark Cuervo and Dark Ozz, thus ending Mutoh's final championship reign in All Japan. Final years and departure (2011-2013) On June 7, 2011, Muto announced his resignation as the president of All Japan Pro Wrestling, remaining in the promotion as an active wrestler and a member of the Supervisory Board. Muto's decision stemmed from a real-life incident where Yoshikazu Taru assaulted Nobukazu Hirai backstage at an All Japan Pro Wrestling show, which led to Hirai suffering a stroke after competing in a match. Muto took the blame for the incident, which led to All Japan suspending not only Taru, but also Kazuhiko Masada, Masayuki Kono and Minoru Tanaka who were present when the attack took place. After being on the midcard and without a big feud for most of 2011, Muto became the main challenger for NOAH's Jun Akiyama, who had won the Triple Crown Championship from Suwama. Muto reunited with Kenta Kobashi at All Together to defeat Akiyama and Takao Omori. Akiyama challenged Muto to a match for the title that took place on March 20, 2012, which Muto eventually lost. On June 1, Muto returned to the United States to make an appearance for Pro Wrestling Syndicate (PWS) in Rahway, New Jersey, teaming with Kai to defeat Anthony Nese and Sami Callihan in a tag team match. In November 2012, Muto and his business partners sold all of their All Japan shares to the Speed Partners corporation for ¬•200 million. On June 1, 2013, Speed Partners president Nobuo Shiraishi took over as the new president of All Japan, firing the previous president, Muto's longtime right- hand man Masayuki Uchida, in the process, which led to Muto resigning from the promotion, effective June 30, 2013. =Sporadic appearances in NJPW= 2004-2005 Muto returned to NJPW as a member of the All Japan roster at Wrestling World on January 4, 2004, to team with Bob Sapp to defeat Cho-Ten. Muto next appeared at Pro-Wrestlers Be Strongest by teaming with Osamu Nishimura in a loss to Hiroshi Tanahashi and Shinsuke Nakamura. Muto would wrestle only one match for NJPW in 2005 at Nexess VI, where he defeated Ron Waterman. 2007-2009 He then appeared at Wrestle Kingdom I in 2007 where he reunited with former partner and rival Masahiro Chono to defeat Tencozy in a \\"Super Dream Tag match\\" pitting NJPW and AJPW wrestlers together. On January 4, 2008, at Wrestle Kingdom II in Tokyo Dome, under the Great Muta persona, he defeated Hirooki Goto. On April 27, Muto defeated Shinsuke Nakamura to win his fourth IWGP Heavyweight Championship, this was his second appearance in 2008 for NJPW and he had not held the title for eight years and four months prior to the win. After retaining the title against Manabu Nakanishi and Togi Makabe, Muta defended the title against former champion Shinsuke Nakamura at Destruction on October 13 and retained following a Frankensteiner. He would lose the title to his former student Hiroshi Tanahashi at Wrestle Kingdom III on January 4, 2009 after Tanahashi used his signature High Fly Flow twice to get the pin. After the match, Muto said backstage that he had passed Tanahashi his sash after doing his best for over half a year to raise the worth of the title, and suggested that he would withdraw and leave New Japan to move their company forward. Muto would make his second appear in NJPW on October 12 to commemorate Masahiro Chono's twenty-fifth year in professional wrestling as Muto teamed with Chono and Kenta Kobashi to defeat Jun Akiyama, Manabu Nakanishi and Satoshi Kojima in a six-man tag team match. 2012-2014 On January 4, 2012, Muto made a return to New Japan at Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome, where he defeated Tetsuya Naito in a singles match. A year later at Wrestle Kingdom 7 in Tokyo Dome, Muto teamed with Shinjiro Otani, a replacement for an injured Daichi Hashimoto, in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima. Muto returned to New Japan again a year later at Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome, now working as The Great Muta in a tag team match, where he and Toru Yano defeated Suzuki-gun (Minoru Suzuki and Shelton X Benjamin). As the only face in the match, Muta turned on Yano towards the end of the match, but his green mist accidentally hit Suzuki instead, leading to Yano pinning him for the win. 2019 Muto, in his Great Muta persona, was the last entrant in the ROH/NJPW Rumble at the G1 Supercard Show on April 6, 2019. This marked his first appearance for the promotion in 5 years. 2020 On February 19, 2020 Muto made an appearance at the Tiger Hattori Retirement Show, appearing alongside fellow NJPW alumni Riki Choshu, The Great Kabuki, and Hiroshi Hase. =Wrestle-1 (2013‚Äì2020)= On July 10, 2013, Muto announced the foundation of a promotion named Wrestle-1, bringing over many of the former wrestlers of All Japan Pro-Wrestling that left in June. At the promotion's inaugural event on September 8, Muto teamed with Bob Sapp in a main event tag team match, where they defeated Ren√© Dupr√©e and Zodiac. During Wrestle-1's second show on September 15, Muto made his first Japanese appearance as The Great Muta in two years, when he and Tajiri defeated Dupr√©e and Zodiac in a tag team match. On October 18, Muto announced his semi- retirement, saying that in the future he would only work Wrestle-1's larger events. On March 2, 2014, Muto put his career on the line at Kaisen: Outbreak, Wrestle-1's first event in Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan. Muto teamed with Rob Terry and the debuting Taiy≈ç Kea in a six-man tag team match, where they defeated Masayuki Kono, Ren√© Dupr√©e and Samoa Joe, thus saving his career. Through Wrestle-1's working relationship with TNA, Muto, working under his Great Muta persona, returned to the American promotion on March 9 at Lockdown, where he, Sanada and Yasu defeated Chris Sabin, Christopher Daniels and Kazarian in a six-man tag team steel cage match. Muta returned to TNA on the July 25, 2014, defeating Robbie E at an Impact Wrestling taping in New York City. After the match, Sanada turned on Muta. This led to a match at Wrestle-1's Sh≈çgeki: Impact event on July 6, where The Great Muta defeated Sanada in a main event singles match. On September 22, Muto suffered his first direct loss since March 2012, when he was submitted by Masayuki Kono in a four-on-three handicap match, where he and the Novus stable (Jiro Kuroshio, Koji Doi and Rionne Fujiwara) faced the Desperado stable (Kono, Kazma Sakamoto and Ryoji Sai). On October 12, Muto, as the Great Muta, worked TNA's Bound for Glory event in Tokyo, teaming with Tajiri in a tag team main event, where they defeated James Storm and The Great Sanada. On November 1, during an event celebrating his 30th anniversary in professional wrestling, Muto defeated Masayuki Kono to become the second Wrestle-1 Champion. He made his first successful title defense on December 22 against Seiya Sanada. His second defense took place on January 30, 2015, when he defeated Manabu Soya. On February 16, Muto, as the Great Muta, returned to TNA, defeating Mr. Anderson as part of Global Impact: USA vs The World. On March 8, Muto lost the Wrestle-1 Championship to Kai in his third defense. On March 27, 2017, Muto announced he was stepping down as the president of Wrestle-1 with Kaz Hayashi taking over the position. Muto remained with the promotion as its representative director. On June 8, 2019, Muto returned to Impact Wrestling, wrestling as The Great Muta in the main event of their A Night You Can't Mist event in a tag team match where he teamed with Tommy Dreamer to defeat Michael Elgin and Johnny Impact. On April 1, 2020 at Wrestle-1's final event, Muto team with Kaz Hayashi, Masayuki Kono, and Shuji Kondo unsuccessfully against Kuma Arashi, Shotaro Ashino, Daiki Inaba, and Koji Doi. Professional wrestling style and persona Muto frequently wrestled under two ring names: the first as Keiji Muto and the second, The Great Muta. Muto innovated the Muta Lock, named after him, and the Shining wizard. He is also known for using the Figure-four leglock and the Moonsault as finishing moves, as well as the Asian mist =Characters= *\\"The Great Muta\\" is Muto's most known gimmick, which he has wrestled as often throughout his career, switching back and forth between this alter ego and his real name since March 1989. He was originally billed as the son of Japanese wrestler Great Kabuki (unrelated in real life), who used a similar gimmick, but the connection is rarely mentioned nowadays. Like his father, Great Muta is a mysterious, manifestly supernatural character who distinguishes himself through his macabre looks and magical skills. His appearance is highlighted by his lavish, exotical entrance costumes, which are taken off to reveal a horrifically painted face, later replaced by an organic-looking mask after Muto shaved his head. Muta uses Muto's moveset with little variation (his version of the Shining Wizard is named Senkou Youjutsu (\\"Flash Magic\\") instead), though Muta tends to be much more aggressive and weapon-friendly. Muta can also spit green or red mist and plays mind games to distract his opponents. The Great Muta is the gimmick most fans in the United States know Muto for, as he wrestled as The Great Muta throughout the late '80s and early '90s for the NWA, and in his later stints in WCW. :The gimmick was deeply expanded during the 2000s in the promotion Hustle, where he appeared in a storyline in which he gained a son in the form of \\"The Great Bono\\" (played by Muta's wrestling trainee Akebono), forming a tag team reminiscence of Muta's team with his own father Great Kabuki. Some of those elements were later used in All Japan Pro Wrestling as well. *\\"Kokushi-Muso\\", a gimmick used on special occasions, is a play-off of Jinsei Shinzaki's mystic character Hakushi. Muto debuted it in Michinoku Pro Wrestling in 2001, but it later migrated with him to All Japan Pro Wrestling, where he used it when teaming with Shinzaki. Kokushi means \\"Black Master\\" in the same line Hakushi means \\"White Master\\", while Muso means \\"Unparalleled\\"; together, they are a pun with the kokushi musou Japanese Mahjong yaku. Like Hakushi, Kokushi is characterized for sporting Buddhist shakyo painted all over his body, though interspersed with English phrases like Muto's motto \\"Puroresu Love\\", and wearing black garments instead of white. Similarly, he uses wrestling moves associated with Hakushi while at the same time retaining mannerisms and moves used by The Great Muta. He finally completes it with Buddhist monk paraphernalia like carrying an ojuzu and meditating in the ring. *\\"White Ninja\\", a Japanese ninja gimmick, was used in Championship Wrestling from Florida between November 1985 and October 1986. *\\"Super Black Ninja\\", a gimmick similar to that of the White Ninja, was used in World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas and also was used in the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico, between January 1988 and March 1989. This was Muto's first gimmick to sport face paint. *\\"Space Lone Wolf\\", a space-age type character, was used in New Japan between October 1986 and December 1987. Space Lone Wolf's entrance attire would feature the numbers \\"610\\" which means \\"Muto\\" in Japanese numerics. Muto had also stated that NJPW founder Antonio Inoki insisted on wearing a helmet to the ring in order to attract sponsorship from a Japanese Motorcycle Helmet manufacturer. Other media A billboard of Muto as Bahamut≈ç in 2013, ran as an advertising campaign for Shingeki no Bahamut Muto has appeared in a vast number of media appearances in Japan, including many commercials and films. Muto was interviewed for wrestling documentary Bloodstained Memoirs. In 1995, Muto starred in the Japanese thriller Yajuu Densetsu: Dragon Blue, as Ryusaki, a suave detective who joins forces with a beautiful young spiritualist named Mazuki (played by Hiroko Tanaka) to solve a bizarre case of killings from a mystical sea creature. In 2004, he played the role of Harold Sakata in the movie Rikid≈çzan, a film based on the real-life story of a wrestler who would eventually be known as the \\"Father of Puroresu\\"; Harold Sakata took Rikidozan under his wing and introduced him into the world of professional wrestling. In 2006, he appeared as a guest star in the Japanese historical drama series Saiy≈´ki, playing a village headman who is helped by Son Gok≈´ (played by Shingo Katori). Muto has worked extensively with Japanese clothing company A Bathing Ape, helping them to produce a number of t-shirts featuring his likeness and the All Japan Pro Wrestling logo. Muto was also responsible for organizing Bapesta Pro Wrestling, a previously annual wrestling event sponsored and promoted by Bape. Muto appears as a gang member in the 2017 video game Yakuza Kiwami 2, alongside Genichiro Tenryu, Masahiro Chono, Riki Choshu and Tatsumi Fujinami. Personal life In 1992, Muto married his wife, Hisae Ashida. Together they have two children, a son (born 1996) and a daughter, Airi (born 2000), who is an actress and has made an appearance for Wrestle-1. Outside of Pro-Wrestling, Muto also owns a Sushi restaurant called \\"Dining 610\\" (ÁÑºËÇâDining 610) which was inspired by Mutoh's early \\"Space Lone Wolf\\" gimmick. It is also worth noting that the numbers 610 (which were featured on Lone Wolf's entrance attire) means \\"Muto\\".

Together with her brother Mahinda, she entered an order of Buddhist monks. The two siblings later went to Sri Lanka to spread the teachings of Buddha at the request of King Devanampiya Tissa (250 BC ‚Äì 210 BC) who was a contemporary of Ashoka. Ashoka was initially reluctant to send his daughter on an overseas mission. However, because of the insistence of Sangamitra herself, he finally agreed. She was sent to Sri Lanka together with several other nuns to start the nun-lineage of Bhikkhunis (a fully ordained female Buddhist monastic) at the request of King Tissa to ordain queen AnulƒÅ and other women of Tissa's court at Anuradhapura who desired to be ordained as nuns after Mahindra converted them to Buddhism. After SanghamittƒÅ‚Äôs contribution to the propagation of Buddhism in Sri Lanka and her establishing the Bikhhunƒ´ Sangha or Meheini Sasna (Order of Nuns) there, her name became synonymous with \\"Buddhist Female Monastic Order of TheravƒÅda Buddhism\\" that was established not only in Sri Lanka but also in Burma, China and Thailand, in particular. The day the most revered tree, the Bodhi tree, a sapling of which was brought by her to Sri Lanka and planted in Anuradhapura, and which still survives, is also celebrated every year on the Full Moon day of December as \\"Uduvapa Poya\\" or \\"Uposatha Poya\\" and \\"SanghamittƒÅ Day\\" by TheravƒÅda Buddhists in Sri Lanka. Background Sanghamitra is known for the proselytisation activity among women that she pursued as her lifetime goal in Sri Lanka, along with her brother, Mahendra (called Mahinda in Sri Lanka) at the initiation of her father, Emperor Ashoka of the Maurya dynasty who ruled in India in the 3rd century BC. Ashoka, after adopting Buddhism, took to spreading tenets of Buddhism in nine other countries of the region. His contemporary in Sri Lanka, King Devanampiya Tissa, in close alliance with Ashoka, saw the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. However, before deputing missions abroad in the region around India, Ashoka, in consultation with Venerable Moggaliputta Tissa convened a meeting of the Third Buddhist Council in which 1,000 Arahants participated. The purpose of this council meeting was not only to purge the Sangha of undesirable elements but also to take a view on the proselytisation of Buddhism in view of the strong challenge faced from the Brahmins of Hindu religion. Moggaliputta presided over the Council meeting where it was decided to send nine delegations to different regions to spread Buddhism. King Ashoka then sent out missionaries in nine different directions. The delegation that was sent south to Sri Lanka, at the request of Tissa, was led by Ashoka's son Mahendra. Before taking the long journey, Mahendra sought blessings of his mother. The delegation (considered a diplomatic mission) comprised six other Arhats, namely Ittiya, Uttiya, Sambala, Bhaddasala, young Samanera (nephew of Mahendra) and a Bhanduka (also a cousin of Mahendra). All members of the mission belonged to the royal family, indicating the importance Ashoka attached to spreading Buddhism in Sri Lanka. This was also considered an opportune moment to spread Buddhism in Sri Lanka since Buddha himself had created awareness of his philosophy and precepts of Buddhism among the royalty and the common people during his three visits to Sri Lanka undertaken in the eight years following his enlightenment. Buddha, during his lifetime, had also created a social structure for the practice of Dhammavinaya or Dhamma (in Sanskrit: Dharma), which comprised the Sangha ‚Äì order of bhikkhus (monks) and bhikkunis (nuns) to preserve his teachings for posterity. However, it was only King Tissa, realising the poor status of the religion in his country, desired fresh efforts by a delegation from India. Mahendra arrived with his delegation at Anuradhapura where King Tissa, accompanied by his sister-in-law (brother's wife) Princess Anula with her entourage of 500 women, met him at the Mahamegha Garden. The Mahendra mission was very successful in introducing Buddhism to Sri Lanka. He established the Bhikkhu Order for men. However, thousands of women, starting with Anula, who had converted to Buddhism along with the King Tissa, wished to be ordained into the Bhikkuni Order. Thera Mahindra expressed his inability to do so since this ordination had to be performed by a priestess or a Theri Arahat. He therefore advised the King to write to Emperor Ashoka and seek the services of his younger sister Theri Sangamitta, who was \\"profoundly learned\\", to be deputed to Sri Lanka for the purpose. He also desired that a sapling of the right branch of the Bodhi-Tree (where the Tathagata got his enlightenment) from Bodh Gaya should also be brought by her to Sri Lanka. King Tissa then chose his Minister Prince Arittha (his nephew) for the purpose since the minister had volunteered to go to India on the condition that on his return he would also be ordained into the Bhikkhu Sasana by Thera Mahindra. This was agreed. Early life Sangamitta's parents were the Emperor Ashoka and his first wife, Devi, who was a Buddhist. Her birth in 281 BC, as popularly known in published texts was as the second child of Ashoka and younger sister of brother Mahindra. She was born in Ujjeini (present day Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh in India). Her mother did not join Ashoka when he was crowned and her two children had embraced Buddhism. She was married at the age of 14 to Agribrahmi, a nephew of Emperor Ashoka, who was also an Arhant. She had a son, Saamanera Sumana who also later became an Arhant and went along with his uncle Mahindra to Sri Lanka to preach Buddhism. Her teacher was Ayupala. She was ordained at the age of 18 into Theravada Buddhism Order by their preceptor Dhammapala. Her brother was also ordained at the same time. With her dedicated perseverance to Dhamma she became an Arhant Theri and resided in Pataliputra (now known as Patna). Middle life Mahindra‚Äôs mission in Sri Lanka was very successful. Among his new converts was Princess Anula, King Tissa‚Äôs sister-in-law who became Sotapanna and requested ordination. King Tissa wrote to Emperor Ashoka to depute Sangamitta for the purpose. Mahindra also wrote to his father to depute his sister Sanghamitta to Sri Lanka as requested by King Tissa. Following this invitation from the King and also the request made by his son Mahindra, Ashoka sent Sanghamitta with a retinue of 10 other learned bhikkunis (priestesses) to accompany her and to give ordination to the Sri Lanka's princess Anula and other women. Ashoka was initially distraught at the prospect of sending his daughter away but Sangamitta herself persisted that she would like to go to Sri Lanka. She appealed to her father stating: The purpose was also to establish the Bhikkuni Order to spread Buddhism in that country with the devoted participation and assistance of women. Ashoka finally agreed to send her. She travelled to Sri Lanka by sea carrying a sapling of Bodhi-Tree in a golden vase. She landed at Jambukola in the North. King Tissa himself received Sangamitta and the sapling of the Bodhi-Tree with deep veneration. They were then ceremonially escorted by the king and his people to Anuradhapura. They entered at the northern gate of Anuradhapura along a road sprinkled with white sand. The Bodhi sapling was planted with great fanfare in the MahƒÅmeghavana Grove in Aunradhapura. It is still seen at the same location. In Dipavamsa chronicle, the number of nuns who accompanied Sangamitta has been mentioned differently ‚Äì three figures have been quoted but the figure of 11 including Sangamitta is inferred as the plausible number. The names of the young nuns who accompanied here on the ship were: Uttara, Hema, Pasadpala, Aggimitta, Dasika, Pheggu, Pabbata, Matta, Malla, and Dhammadasiya. In addition, the delegation headed by the Sri Lankan Ambassador Prince Athitha, which returned to Sri Lanka, comprised the Chief priestess Sangamitta and ten other priesteses, eight people of royal lineage of Magadha (Bogut, Sumitta, Sangot, Devgot, Damgot, Hirugot, Sisigot and Jutindhara), eight members of nobility (families of ministers), eight Brahmins, eight Vaishyas (traders), herdsmen, Hyaenna, Sparrow-hawk, Nagas, Yakkas, craftsmen, weavers, potters and many members of other castes. A legend mentioned related to the journey of Sangamitta to Sri Lanka is that Nagas encircled the Bodhi tree. Sangamitta drove them away by assuming the form of Garuda (half-man half-bird form). Sanghamitta was 32 years of age when she took this journey. Her son Samanera was already in Sri Lanka as he had joined his uncle Mahindra's mission to spread Buddhism. Sangamitta performed the formal Pabbajja ordination of Princess Anula. Anula was the first Sri Lankan woman to be ordained as a bhikkuni; concurrently her companions numbering more than 1000 who were also observing Dasa Sil were bestowed with Pabbajja ordination. This formally created the \\"first ecclesiastical life of the Bhikkuni Sasana in Sri Lanka\\". The ordination covered not only the royalty but also common people of various strata of the society. She pursued every effort to enhance the status of woman, with sustained devotion, dedication and diligence. Sangamitta, on arrival at Anuradhapura, was put up initially at the ‚ÄòUpasika Viharaya‚Äô along with the bhikkunis who had accompanied her. An additional 12 buildings (ashramas) were built to accommodate the bhikkunis. Subsequently, the King also built a separate house for Sangamitta known as 'Hathalakha-Vihara' acceding to the request of the nuns to reside in a secluded place where they could exclusively concentrate on devotional religious pursuits. Dipavamsa, a chronicle written in 400 BC, records that after the Bhikkuni Sangha was established, there was widespread following in the country among women of all ages and from all levels of society. The women who ordained were highly learned in the scriptures and they readily taught their knowledge of the Vinaya or rules of discipline to others. ;Bodhi tree and celebrations Revered Bodhi tree brought by Sangamitta and planted at Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka -Oldest surviving Bodhi Tree SangamittƒÅ carried the right south branch of the Bodhi-Tree (selected by Ashoka from the Maha Bodhi-Tree in Gaya) on a ship to AnurƒÅdhapura, during the 12th year of Ashoka's reign. The sapling was planted by DevƒÅnƒÅmpiya Tissa in the MahƒÅmeghavana in Anurdhapura. It seems that \\"the Buddha, on his death bed, had resolved five things, one being that the branch which should be taken to Ceylon should detach itself\\". The journey route followed by Sangamitta who carried the tree branch was from GayƒÅ to PƒÅtaliputta and then to TƒÅmalittƒ´ in Bengal. Here, it was placed in a golden vase in the ship and transported to Jambukola across the sea. The entourage reached AnurƒÅdhapura, staying en route at Tivakka. The planting of the Bodhi Tree was a grand ceremony performed by the king himself with assistance from the nobles of KƒÅjaragƒÅma, CandanagƒÅma and Tivakka, in the presence of Sangamitta and her brother Mahindra. The tree took eight roots, yielded fruits and seeds. As fresh eight saplings emerged, they were moved and planted at Jambukola (present Colombogaon in north Sri Lanka), in the village of Tivakka, at Th≈´pƒÅrƒÅmƒÅ, at IssaramanƒÅrƒÅma, in the court of the Pathamacetiya, in Cetiyagiri, in KƒÅjaragƒÅma and in CandanagƒÅma. The tree, as it stands, is on raised mound. In 1907, it was in height with in girth. Th tree and the shrine have been built around a compound wall measuring x and in height, primarily to protect the tree and the shrine built around it. Ten more trees of the same species are also seen within precincts of the enclosure. A damaged Buddha statue made in bricks (attributed its creation during Tissa's rule) is a marker to locate the main Bodhi-Tree here. 32 more saplings, from four other fruits, were also planted in the near vicinity. The Bodhi-Tree at Anuradhapura was well tended by successive royal family members of Sri Lanka over the centuries, so much so that a village near AnurƒÅdhapura was also earmarked to provide for maintenance of the tree. A recent comment by Historian H. G. Wells on this oldest historical tree in the world, which is well maintained states: Later life Sangamitta died at the age of 79 in the ninth year of the reign of King Uttiya at her residence in Hatthaloka Upasikaramaya Anuradhapura. Uttiya performed her last rites. The occasion was also marked with observances in her honour throughout Sri Lanka, for one week. She was cremated to the east of the Th≈´pƒÅrƒÅma near the CittasƒÅlƒÅ, in front of the Bodhi-Tree. The location for the cremation had been selected by the Therƒ´ herself before her death. A stupa was erected by Uttiya over her ashes. Bhikkhuni Sangha A bhikkuni of the Chinese Mahayana tradition The Bhikkhuni Sangha (a Dhamma-vinaya heritage started by Lord Buddha during his lifetime in India), locally known as \\"Bikhhuni Sasana\\" or \\"Meheini Sasna\\" (Order of Priestesses or Nuns) that was established by Sangamitta in Sri Lanka prospered for over 1000 years, till it disappeared in 1017 AD. The reason for such an end is attributed to the invasion of Cholas, Hindu rulers from South India, whereafter Bhikkhus and Bhikkunis were not seen in Sri Lanka for quite some years. Bhikkuni ordination is the third and ultimate stage of ordination of nuns; the earlier two stages are the sramanerika (novice) and siksamana (probationary). In India, the Bhikkuni Order was established by Buddha six years after the Bhikkhu Order was established, in the 6th century BC. It was spread to Sri Lanka by Sangamitta in the 3rd BC. Initially, with spread of Buddhism in ancient India, 18 (eighteen) Vinaya schools developed. However, now only three are extant. These are the Theravada practiced in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia; the Dharmaguptaka that is practiced in Taiwan, China, Korea, and Vietnam; and the third school is the Mulasarvastivada adopted in Tibet. In 429 AD, Bhikkuni Devasara had realised that Bhikkuni Sanga, on account of war and famine, could vanish from Sri Lanka. She, therefore, had led a mission to China to establish the Bhikkuni Sasana. The original Theravada Bhikkuni lineage established in China since 429 AD has continued to function to this day. However, Asarana Sarana Saranankara Maha Thera re-introduced the Higher Ordination from Thailand. He is credited with re-establishing the Order of Monks in Sri Lanka in 1753 AD. It is now said that there are more than 400 Bhikkunis in the country. In Thailand, the lineage is well established. A clay statue of Sanghamitta made by Dhammananda in 2002, is deified in a shrine room at Songdhammakalyani Monastery in Nakhonpathom. Her image is flanked by images of 13 Arahat Theris. It is also reported that a few women from western countries practising the Theravada tradition and a few women from Thailand have been ordained to bhikkuni order in Sri Lanka in recent years. Uduvapa Poya festival Unduvapa Poya festival is observed in Sri Lanka on the Full Moon of December to commemorate two specific events namely, Theri Sangamitta day of arrival from India to establish the Order of Nuns and to also mark her bringing a sapling of the sacred Bodhi-Tree from Bodh Gaya and planting it in Aunradhapura. The festival day has been designated as \\"Sanghamitta Day\\". On this day, ten ordained nuns initiate the festive celebrations every year. This observance was revived in 1903 at the suggestion of the Mahabodhi Society of Sri Lanka. This Observance is performed by Buddhists by first following the 'Five Precepts'; bathing, shaving, wearing white robes, and kneeling with clean bare feet in a shrine before a Buddha-statue. The kneeling and bowing is done first three times with feet, hands, elbows, knees and head touching the floor. This is followed by reciting loudly the memorised prayers, with folded hands (palms at the heart). The prayers offered from sunrise until the next dawn starting with the words are: It is also a prayer offered on this day for the revival of Bhikkuni Sasana in Sri Lanka and with the hope that it will flourish in the future. It is proposed that the day should also be celebrated as the International Women‚Äôs Day, as a mark of honour to Sangamitta who established the women's Order.

Gordon (born March 6, 1937) is a Canadian politician, who served as mayor of Sudbury, Ontario from 1976 to 1981 and from 1991 to 2003, and as a Member of Provincial Parliament for the provincial electoral district of Sudbury from 1981 to 1987.Our Neighbours: People who have made a difference . Sudbury Star, February 26, 2011. p. 13. He briefly served in the Executive Council of Ontario, holding the position of Minister of Government Services in 1985. He is Sudbury's longest-serving mayor, having served a total of 17 years. In 2000, the Canadian edition of Reader's Digest named him one of the three most influential and innovative mayors in Canada.Oiva Saarinen, From Meteorite Impact to Constellation City: A Historical Geography of Greater Sudbury. Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 2013. .  Early life and education  Gordon was born in Rouyn-Noranda in 1937, and grew up in Sudbury. He was part of the first graduating class of St. Charles College. During high school he was president of the student council and hosted his own radio program, Time for Teens, Saturdays between 1951 and 1955 on CKSO radio in Sudbury. He competed in distance running, one and two mile, in track and field. He achieved his Bachelor of Arts (Psychology) at Assumption University in 1960. In his final year of university, he married Donna Drew. In 1961, they returned to Greater Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to CKSO Radio and Television, Gordon worked in sales for UPJOHN Pharmaceuticals and then became a secondary school teacher. Jim and Donna Gordon raised six daughters and now have ten grandchildren. Teaching career Gordon taught English in the secondary school system in Greater Sudbury over the course of four decades. He also held a specialist in Library Science and was responsible for the Resource Centre at Nickel District Secondary School for some of his tenure at the school. Gordon taught at the following secondary schools, returning to education at various junctures of his political career: * St. Charles College ‚Äì 1961 to 1965 * Espanola High School ‚Äì 1965 to 1966 * Confederation High School ‚Äì 1965 to 1968 * St. Charles College ‚Äì 1968 to 1969 * Nickel District Secondary School ‚Äì 1969 to 1976 * Sudbury Secondary School ‚Äì 1988 to 1991 Political career Gordon served on the town council of Espanola in 1965\\"Gordon leaves local politics\\". Sudbury Star, June 13, 2003. before moving back to Sudbury. He ran as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the Sudbury constituency in the 1967 election, but was not elected. He was elected to Sudbury City Council in 1971, and became mayor in 1976. He served until 1981, and ran for a second time as the Progressive Conservative candidate in Sudbury in the 1981 provincial election. He won that election, and served as a backbench supporter of Bill Davis's government. Gordon supported Larry Grossman at the Progressive Conservative Party's leadership convention of February 1985. Gordon was a cabinet minister in the short-lived government of Frank Miller, serving as Minister of Government Services from May 17 to June 26, 1985 until Miller's government was defeated by the Ontario Liberal Party sweep of David Peterson in the 1987 election. Gordon was defeated by Sterling Campbell in Sudbury. In 1991, Gordon ran again as mayor of Sudbury, and defeated incumbent mayor Peter Wong. He served as the city's mayor until 2000, when the city, the towns and the Regional Municipality of Sudbury were transitioned into the new city of Greater Sudbury through a transition board established by the Government of Ontario. He ran for mayor of the new amalgamated city in the 2000 municipal election, and won that election as well. Gordon's tenure as mayor of Sudbury was marked by efforts to diversify the city's mining-based economy. As the city's provincial representative in the early 1980s, he was also a key supporter of the Science North project, which has since become the city's and Northern Ontario's most successful tourist attraction. Gordon announced his retirement from politics in 2003.  Mayor of City of Sudbury, 1976‚Äì1981  =Fiscal responsibility= Gordon introduced zero based budgeting, a back to basics form of analyzing municipal budgets. The city was fiscally constrained in the 1970s. He would later use this policy as mayor in the 1990s to achieve zero increases in taxes and develop a more effective and efficient workforce in the city's many departments. =Development and housing= Gordon worked with city council to encourage the private sector and the provincial government including John Rhodes (Minister of Housing at the time) to expand the supply of housing in Sudbury which resulted in many new homes, apartment developments and housing for the socially disadvantaged. =Re-greening of Sudbury= Gordon supported and worked with municipal leaders such as Tom Davies, chair of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury, and other regional politicians in the creation of policies that established a successful re- greening effort that was eventually recognized by the United Nations for successful environmental land reclamation.  Member of provincial parliament for Sudbury, 1981‚Äì1987  =Northeast Cancer Centre (formerly Northeastern Regional Cancer Treatment Centre)= In 1983, as parliamentary assistant to Minister of Health Larry Grossman, Gordon was able to secure a decision by the government to establish a cancer treatment centre in Sudbury, which now serves Northeastern Ontario.‚ÄúThe Northern Cancer Foundation Story‚Äù Sudbury Living, September 1, 2012. The development of a cancer centre allowed patients and families to remain closer to their homes in the north during treatment as well as making Sudbury a major medical centre within the northeast.\\"Regional Cancer Program celebrates 20th birthday‚Äù Northern Life, November 5, 2010. The sophistication of the cancer treatment centre as both a treatment centre and an important research facility was one of the cornerstones Gordon was able to leverage in his pursuit of a medical school for Northern Ontario. =Agency status for Science North= Gordon was instrumental in getting the province of Ontario to agree to make Science North an agency of the province, thereby providing a solid base of operating funding for what is now Canada's second largest science centre. =Development of mining machinery manufacturing= Sudbury has always been a centre of resource extraction. INCO and Falconbridge Nickel Mines were the largest producers, but Gordon argued that, in addition to mining, the development of a mining machinery manufacturing industry would contribute greatly to the stability of the economy in Sudbury. To that end, he met with the provincial Minister of Industry, Gordon Walker. Walker agreed that the government would set up a Centre for Resource Machinery Technology, and he appointed as its members Jim Gordon (MPP for Sudbury), Mike Harris (MPP for Nipissing), Darryl Lake (Cambrian College), and Walter Curlook (vice- president of INCO for Ontario Operations, later President). INCO became very interested in participating in this project because it would benefit both the company and the community, and through negotiations, eventually received a grant from the Ontario government. The mining machinery manufacturing company that was set up by INCO, now known as Continuous Mining, has since been purchased by Bob Lipic.  Mayor of Sudbury and Greater Sudbury, 1991‚Äì2003  During the 1990s Sudbury experienced a substantial loss of population along with stagnant municipal assessment. Recognizing the importance of diversification and development to the city's survival, Gordon spearheaded specific major initiatives. Gordon worked with others at all levels of government and fostered a strong relationship with city council to achieve fiscal strength for the city and projects that would benefit the community and the Northeast. =Northern Ontario Mayors' Coalition= In 1992, Gordon tried to unite municipalities in Northern Ontario, with the cooperation of Thunder Bay mayor David Hamilton. Initially, he held a meeting in Thunder Bay in an effort to form an organization to lobby government. The outcome was that he and Hamilton spearheaded the organization of a coalition of mayors of the five largest cities in Northern Ontario (Sudbury, Thunder Bay, Timmins, Sault Ste. Marie and North Bay). This coalition gave the largest northern municipalities a unified voice in their dealings with the provincial and federal governments. This group, representing approximately 70 per cent of Northern Ontario's population, worked for projects benefitting the whole of Northern Ontario. Over time, this strategy proved effective in pursuing the establishment of the Northern Ontario School of Medicine,‚ÄúNorthern Mayors Unite in Bid for Northern Ontario Rural Medical School‚Äù. Jan. 15, 2001 - City of Greater Sudbury news release which would train doctors to serve rural, northern and aboriginal communities, as well as other initiatives such as broadband infrastructure in Northern Ontario. =Northern Ontario School of Medicine= Gordon was a driving force in obtaining a medical school in response to the ongoing challenges of health-care delivery in the north, in particular the shortage of doctors and the difficulties in providing effective health care for rural and aboriginal communities. In 1999, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care appointed Dr. Robert McKendry to report on physician supply and demand in the province. The report gave weight to the view that \\"the established medical schools had paid insufficient attention to preparing students for rural and northern practice\\". McKendry came to the conclusion that meeting underserviced areas' needs might best be met by building a new medical school.\\"Medical school takes step forward, Gordon says\\". Sudbury Star, May 5, 2005. In addition to the efforts being made by the university community and medical professionals in the north,Chris Polehoykie, \\"Gordon says North must keep pressure on for medical school: Decision expected next month\\". Sudbury Star, October 26, 2000. Gordon realized that political initiative was required to put pressure on the government of Premier Mike Harris. To that end he arranged, on behalf of the Northern Ontario Mayors Coalition, a coalition of the mayors of the five major cities in the north, to meet with Health Minister Elizabeth Witmer to plead their case. Witmer agreed to have the government's expert panel receive a proposal from the north, a proposal that laid out a model for an entirely new school. However, the expert panel had other ideas,\\"Medical campus not enough\\". Sudbury Star, February 22, 2001. and on February 16, 2001, the Toronto Star published a leaked report that the intention was that Sudbury, Thunder Bay and Windsor would become clinical education campuses, extensions of programmes at existing medical schools. Gordon had been quoted, saying, \\"It's time for us, the councils in the north, to move politically on this,\\" and when the April 2001 Speech from the Throne brought no announcement, Gordon arranged that the Northern Ontario Mayors' Coalition would meet with the Minister of Northern Development and Mines, Dan Newman.Chris Polehoykie. \\"Gordon says North must keep pressure on for medical school: Decision expected next month\\".

Feb. 27, 2003 - City of Greater Sudbury news release Approximately 3,000 jobs were created in the technology sector between 1995 and 2000. In 1998, he secured $1 million in funding from the provincial government to launch sureNet (Sudbury Regional Network), Sudbury's fibre-optic communications network. Gordon was the founding chair of the sureNet consortium, which included partners such as health, education, municipal and private groups. =NetCentral= In 1999, Gordon became the founding chairman of NetCentral, a not-for-profit corporation supported by the mayors of Sudbury, Chapleau, Parry Sound, Elliot Lake and Northeastern Manitoulin and the Islands. The purpose of NetCentral was to develop a high speed, high capacity telecommunications network infrastructure to foster economic development and create jobs, and to create better access to educational and health services in and among Northern Ontario communities.NetCentral media release NetCentral was incorporated in 1999 to develop a high-speed telecommunications network infrastructure for the following purposes: to connect communities, public agencies and organizations; to enhance access to educational and health services in northern communities; and to promote technology oriented economic development and job creation in Northern Ontario. As a result of Sudbury's high-speed telecommunications network Sudbury attracted companies such as Teletech and Canadian Blood Services, creating thousands of jobs for the region. =Music and film industry support= Gordon worked closely with the proponents of two major developments in the arts community over the past two decades: Music and Film in Motion,‚ÄúCity of Greater Sudbury Provides Funding to Music and Film in Motion‚Äù.

This panel was composed of leaders from industry, educational institutions, First Nations, community organizations and the municipal sector \\"to develop recommendations for bringing increased prosperity and growth to northeastern Ontario\\". The provision of a tax incentive zone was one of many recommendations made by this panel. =Fiscal responsibility= As mayor, Gordon worked with city council to establish a climate in which collaboration and cooperation was encouraged to find a way to hold the line on property taxes. The mayor worked in partnership with the city's management and the unionized employees to use the zero-based budgeting process and to find millions of dollars in efficiencies in the city's budget without layoffs. As a result, the city was able to hold the line on taxes while continuing to provide the level of service that citizens expected. In 1994, Sudbury topped the list of local municipal efforts to control property taxes in Ontario, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (Members‚Äô Opinions Survey #34, July 1994), a survey based on 8,058 face-to-face interviews with members from 18 communities. =Local community initiatives= Gordon strongly supported multicultural initiatives and associations in Sudbury throughout his career, including the Sudbury Multicultural and Folk Arts Association, an umbrella organization of 50 delegate groups with a client population of over 30,000 citizens of Sudbury. He attended numerous functions and provided guidance and assistance. On the occasion of the official visit of Lieutenant Governor Hilary Weston on July 1, 2001, he received recognition from the multicultural community at the Canada Day celebrations. He has been made an honorary lifetime member of the Societa Caruso and been awarded the Gold Combatants Cross in recognition of his assistance to the Polish Combatants Association, an organization originally established by 5,000 Polish veterans who had fought with the Allies in World War II and who were allowed by the Canadian government to immigrate to Canada. He lobbied, along with the original proponents H√©l√®ne Fontaine (now deceased) and Jacques Michaud, for the establishment of a French college in Sudbury, which is now Coll√®ge Bor√©al.

History The island was named Wells Island but during his 1815 survey of the US-Canada border renamed by Captain William Fitzwilliam Owen to the current name to honor Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Several prominent points in and around the island were named after the Duke's victorious battles. None of those names stuck. The large bay around which the island folds is called Lake of the Isles, not Lake Waterloo.Smith, Susan Weston, The First Summer People: the Thousand Islands 1650-1910. Stoddart Publishing, Toronto, 1993. Geography The island is located in the St. Lawrence River, which surrounds Wellesley Island on three sides. The island bounds an internal body of water, the Lake of the Isles, which nearly doubles its waterfront. The easternmost peninsula of the island lies across the Upper (American) Narrows from the Village of Alexandria Bay. View of Dukeman's Island, located in the middle of Wellesley Island's interior Lake of the Isles An arterial highway, Interstate 81, crosses Wellesley Island. Five segments composing the Thousand Islands International Bridge link the island to the opposite shores of the river. Said to be \\"the smallest vehicular international bridge in the world,\\" one of the bridges crosses a narrow channel, the International Rift, which separates Wellesley Island in the United States from Hill Island in Canada. The United States border-crossing facility at the port of entry is located on the northeastern part of the island. Wellesley, one of the largest of the Thousand Islands in the St. Lawrence River, is home to a growing number of full-time residents. Population increases dramatically during the summer months. The island has two State Parks, a nature center, and three golf courses. Located on its southern tip is the Thousand Island Park Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. In addition to Interstate 81, which connects two portions of the Thousand Islands Bridge, Jefferson County Routes 100 and 191 serve the island.

During the time of inhabitation by the Shawnee, the Pickaway Plains were covered by prairie vegetation, mainly grasses. Villages This area was inhabited most recently by the Shawnee, who founded at least three villages here: * Cornstalk Town was located on the north bank of the Scippo Creek in Pickaway County, Ohio.

The principal Chiefs of this area were the legendary Chief Cornstalk (Hokolewqua) and his giant sister, Grenadier Squaw (non-hel-e-ma) who stood at six and a half feet tall.\\" Tecumseh's birth \\"occurred while his parents, Shawnee war chief, Pucksinwah, and his wife, Methotasa, were en route from their village of Kispoko Town, on the Scioto River, to a major tribal council at the Shawnee tribal capital village of Chalahgawth (Chillicothe - now Oldtown), which was located \\"two arrow flights\\" northwest.\\" File:PickawayPlains3.JPG|Non-Hel-E-Ma sign located on Emerson Road. Dunmore's War In 1774, the Shawnee and allied nations sent around 300-500 men from the Pickaway Plains area to meet Lord Dunmore's army of Virginia militia. Lord Dunmore was attempting both to subdue the Shawnee and Mingo, and to prevent Pennsylvania from laying claim upon present-day Ohio. This conflict became known as Dunmore's War. At Point Pleasant, West Virginia, Cornstalk and his army met a detachment of Dunmore's army under command of Colonel Andrew Lewis. The forces met on October 10, 1774, at what became known as the Battle of Point Pleasant. After several hours of intense fighting, Lewis's detachment drove Cornstalk and his men northward, across the Ohio River. Dunmore then led his army in pursuit of the Shawnee. Cornstalk and his men retreated to Pickaway Plains, with Dunmore's army still in pursuit. As they reached the villages, Dunmore requested that Cornstalk discuss a peace treaty. Cornstalk agreed after he received word that Lewis's detachment had destroyed several villages along the Ohio River. At the treaty, held at Camp Charlotte, Cornstalk agreed to honor the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768, ceding the Shawnee hunting lands of present-day Kentucky to Virginia.

He was elected president on June 30, 2009, at the union's first constitutional convention. Wilhelm served as president of HERE from 1998 to 2004. During his HERE presidency, he furthered the union's reputation as an organizing union, and achieved net growth after more than 25 years of membership decline. HERE also substantially diversified its national leadership, including election in 2001 of the union's first women general officers, its first general officer of color, its first Asian-American vice president, significant increases in the number of African-American, Latino, and women vice presidents, and its first elected Canadian director. Since 1999, Wilhelm has been the Chairman of UNITE HERE Health. He is a trustee of the National Retirement Fund, the Consolidated Retirement Fund, and the Southern Nevada Culinary and Bartenders Pension Fund. He serves as a board member of the Brookings Institution and the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc., and is a member of the AFL-CIO Executive Committee and Executive Council.UNITE HERE about John W.

Wilhelm is a cousin of Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City. =Donald \\"D\\" Taylor= On November 29, 2012 Donald \\"D\\" Taylor was elected the new president of UNITE HERE after the retirement of former president John W. Wilhelm. Taylor is a leader of UNITE HERE's largest affiliate, Local 226 in Las Vegas (also called the Culinary Workers' Union). Representing 60,000 workers, Local 226 is widely recognized for leading the transformation of hospitality-industry jobs from low-wage, insecure work to stable, middle-class occupations. The housekeepers, restaurant workers, beverage service workers and bell staff who make up the membership of Local 226 are also recognized as a powerful political force in Nevada and national politics. UNITE HERE was the first international union to endorse Barack Obama for president in 2008, and Local 226 has been credited with leading the transformation of Nevada from a red state to a Democratic stronghold. In 2012 the union again led a major political program, particularly among Latino voters, contributing to President Obama's victory in Nevada. Taylor served as staff director of UNITE HERE Local 226 from 1990 to 2002 and secretary-treasurer since 2002, and as General Vice President of UNITE HERE since 2009. Upon his election as UNITE HERE's President, he pledged to develop leadership among young people and people of color, and to expand the success of the union in Las Vegas to hospitality workers elsewhere. Split and reaffiliation with AFL-CIO The merger of UNITE and HERE faced initial difficulties due to disagreements between its leaders. By 2007, Raynor was accusing Wilhelm of stifling change, and Wilhelm was angry at Raynor's \\"heavy-handed\\" managerial style. Raynor's critics also said the union president often agreed to \\"sweetheart deals\\" that hurt workers but which added new members and avoided protracted organizing battles. According to at least one account, Raynor was unhappy that the HERE faction had a majority on the board, which permitted Wilhelm and his supporters to veto his proposals. Raynor allegedly began talking about a \\"divorce\\" of the two merged unions in order to precipitate just such an outcome. In 2007 the union lost its bargaining certificate at Vancouver's General Motors Place. The British Columbia Labour Relations Board conducted a vote to find the employees' preferred affiliation with the Christian Labourers Association of Canada. Significant conflict within the union emerged in early 2009. The union had 366,958 members at the end of 2008. In late 2008, General President Bruce Raynor and 15 local and regional UNITE HERE affiliates in the laundry and garment industries filed lawsuits against Hospitality Division President John Wilhelm, accusing him and his division of fraud, theft, gross mismanagement of $61 million in funds committed to union organizing drives, and failing to resolve members' grievances.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Infighting Distracts Unions at Crucial Time.\\" New York Times.

February 13, 2009. Raynor also accused Wilhelm and his allies of attempting to impose their will on the executive board and the majority of members. Wilhelm and several affiliate leaders in the hospitality division sued Raynor and his allies in the laundry and garment division, claiming that Raynor had acted in violation of the union's constitution and procedures in firing large numbers of Wilhelm supporters in Detroit and Phoenix, Arizona. Wilhelm also accused Raynor of disloyaltyIn business ethics and law, members of a board of directors, managers, supervisors, and employees have the duty to remain loyal to the organization. Examples of disloyalty include, but are not limited to, self-dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of confidentiality, violation of a non-compete clause, or failure to publicly support an organization's stated goals, mission, or policies.

By March 2009, the conflict had become unresolveable. On March 7, 2009, Raynor and his supporters held a disaffiliation referendum vote among the members in their affiliate unions in advance of UNITE HERE's first quadrennial convention (set for summer 2009), and said that if they were successful they would affiliate with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).Larrubia, Evelyn. \\"UNITE HERE Faction Sets Vote on Leaving Union.\\" Los Angeles Times. March 7, 2009. Wilhelm and his supporters said that the UNITE HERE constitution prevented any such vote without the permission of the international union's executive board. Also at issue was control over Amalgamated Bank, which UNITE brought with it into the merger and whose ownership (and its substantial net worth) now belonged to UNITE HERE.Mishak, Michael. \\"UNITE HERE Even More Split as Co-Leader Resigns in Huff.\\" Las Vegas Sun. May 31, 2009. Wilhelm sued Raynor and the 15 affiliates in February 2009 in U.S. district court, but the court declined to prevent the vote. The period before the vote led to more accusations of misconduct. Wilhelm and his supporters accused SEIU President Andrew Stern of supporting Raynor's disaffiliation move, a charge Stern vigorously denied. Wilhelm also accused Raynor of supporting the disaffiliation effort only because he faced a difficult re-election bid, and of misusing union money and staff to support the secession effort. Raynor categorically denied all charges. Delegates from the 15 affiliates (representing 100,000 members) met in Philadelphia in late March, and on March 22, 2009, they voted to disaffiliate from UNITE HERE and establish a new union, Workers United.Hananel, Sam. \\"Nation's Fastest Growing Union Gets Bigger.\\" Associated Press.

Despite winning the disaffiliation vote, Raynor announced he would finish his term as General President of UNITE HERE rather than join Workers United‚Äîa move, one newspaper said, undertaken so that Workers United could gain control of the Amalgamated Bank. UNITE HERE and Workers United began arguing over who had jurisdiction over various kinds of workers and how to divide UNITE HERE's assets (most importantly, the bank). Wilhelm asked a federal court to give UNITE HERE control over all the union's assets, but the court declined to issue a ruling at that time.Smith, Ben. \\"The UNITE HERE Hearing.\\" Politico. April 8, 2009.Smith, Ben. \\"Clash at Union's New York Headquarters.\\" Politico. May 22, 2009. Joseph T. Hansen, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), attempted to mediate a solution in mid-April, proposing (among other things) that UNITE HERE take jurisdiction over workers in the gaming industry and hotels; that Workers United take jurisdiction over workers in textiles and laundries; and that the two unions split organizing in food service. Hansen also suggested that Workers United keep the Amalgamated Bank and the former New York City headquarters of UNITE, but that Workers United make a multimillion-dollar payment to UNITE HERE to compensate it for the losses. Wilhelm rejected the offer. Andrew Stern then suggested that each union retain their existing casino workers, but that UNITE HERE have exclusive jurisdiction over casino workers in the future. Workers United would also pay UNITE HERE $20 million immediately and $46 million move within five years, if UNITE HERE would agree to turn the Amalgamated Bank and other of UNITE's pre- merger assets over to Workers United. United States Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also unsuccessfully attempted to mediate the dispute.Orey, Michael and Sasseen, Jane. \\"No Solidarity for Labor\\". Business Week. June 4, 2009. American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten urged the sides to settle as well, writing a letter to both Raynor and Wilhelm cautioning that \\"This conflict is causing collateral damage... . The longer it continues, the less likely we are to enact a strong Employee Free Choice Act.\\" Raynor did not finish his term. In April 2009, Wilhelm formally charged Raynor of using union resources to support the disaffiliation movement. Later that month, the UNITE HERE executive board gave Wilhelm the power to suspend Raynor as the union's president, pending an investigation into Wilhelm's charges.Ellis, Kristi. \\"UNITE HERE Suspends Raynor.\\" Women's Wear Daily. May 15, 2009. Wilhelm suspended Raynor on May 15. Raynor sued Wilhelm and UNITE HERE in federal court, arguing suspension was not permitted under the union's constitution.Ellis, Kristi. \\"UNITE HERE Clash Intensifies.\\" Women's Wear Daily. May 26, 2009. At 4:00 AM on May 22, UNITE HERE's executive board and John Wilhelm ordered security guards to secure Raynor's New York City office and prevent Raynor and his allies from entering.Gonzalez, Juan. \\"Union Shocker: UNITE-HERE Boss Faces Ax in Labor War.\\" New York Daily News. May 29, 2009.Lynch, Matthew. \\"Judge Rejects Raynor Court Request.\\" Women's Wear Daily. May 27, 2009. Wilhelm said he acted to prevent the destruction of documents, and that Raynor's staff had already removed hundreds of documents and scrubbed computer hard drives clean. Wilhelm told the press on May 28 that UNITE HERE staff had found documents showing that Raynor was receiving confidential updates about Workers United activities and finances even though he was still a UNITE HERE official, and that he had shifted millions of dollars of union assets to affiliates seeking disaffiliation.Smith, Ben. \\"Workers United Pleads Poverty to SEIU.\\" Politico. May 28, 2009. Juan Gonzalez, a columnist for New York Daily News, reported on June 16, 2009, that Raynor had transferred more than $12 million to affiliates which supported him as well as to groups outside the union.Gonzalez, Juan. \\"Battle Over $12M Splits Labor Movement UNITE HERE.\\" New York Daily News. June 16, 2009. The transfers allegedly included: * A January 31, 2009, transfer of $457,981 to The Organizing Group, a consulting firm founded by Steve Rosenthal (a close associate of former SEIU President Andrew Stern). The Organizing Group, the paper said, used the money to mail and call to UNITE HERE members and advocate for disaffiliation, and to set up a pro-disaffiliation Web site. * About a dozen transfers totalling $11.2 million between January 26 and 31, 2009, to affiliates which supported Raynor and the disaffiliation movement. The affiliates then allegedly transferred the funds to an external group called Fund for the Future, which supported the disaffiliation effort. * Another dozen transfers totaling $500,000 on March 6, 2009, sent to supportive affiliates allegedly to reimburse them for expenditures. According to internal union documents obtained by the newspaper, Raynor disbursed the money without the required approval from Wilhelm. Wilhelm also accused Raynor of absconding with the $23 million UNITE HERE strike fund (which was invested in the Amalgamated Bank), and investing another $333 million in long-term assets so that the union could not function. Raynor categorically denied the charges. Raynor sued Wilhelm and UNITE HERE, seeking an injunction, access to his office, and return of all property therein. The court declined the request for injunctive relief on May 26. An angry Raynor accused Wilhelm of removing his personal files from the office and resigned on May 30 mere hours before the start of the hearing on his suspension. Wilhelm was named General President of UNITE HERE after Raynor's resignation. He was elected to the position at the union's first quadrennial convention in July 2009. Wilhelm subsequently accused SEIU of spending millions of dollars to convince more UNITE HERE members to disaffiliate and join Workers United. UNITE HERE retaliated by urging employers not to recognize or negotiate with the locals affiliated with Workers United or honor their dues checkoff agreements. Stern disputed the claim, saying SEIU was merely helping its affiliate regain textile workers still part of UNITE HERE, and that SEIU itself had a legitimate right to organize workers in food service. Stern also said on August 12, 2009, that the efforts had stopped. Nonetheless, UFCW President Joe Hansen continued to try to mediate a resolution, and expressed his hope that a settlement was possible. In July 2009, the presidents of 27 national unions signed a letter sent to Stern in which they announced their support of UNITE HERE and said they would help defend the union against any raid on its membership or incursion into its organizing jurisdiction. The remaining 265,000 members of UNITE HERE reaffiliated with the AFL-CIO on September 17, 2009.Greenhouse, Steve. \\"Union Rejoining A.F.L.-C.I.O.\\" New York Times.

On July 25, 2010, SEIU and UNITE HERE announced they had resolved their 18-month-long dispute. As part of the agreement, ownership of the Amalgamated Bank will be transferred to Workers United (pending approval of federal banking regulators).Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Service Unions Agree to End a Long Dispute.\\" New York Times. July 26, 2010.Smith, Ben. \\"A Labor Deal.\\" Politico. July 27, 2010. UNITE HERE retained ownership of the union's headquarters in New York City and an additional $75 million in assets. The agreement also settles a jurisdictional dispute over which workers the unions will organize. UNITE HERE agreed to restrict its organizing in the food service industry to those workers at airline caterers, airports, businesses, convention centers, and athletic stadiums, while SEIU and Workers United will restrict its organizing activity in the industry to food service workers in state and local government, health care facilities, and prisons. Both unions will continue to organize food service workers in elementary, middle, and secondary schools and in higher education. The two unions had also disagreed over whether several thousand members of Workers United had been given the opportunity to choose which union they wished to belong to. In the new agreement, SEIU and UNITE HERE agreed to let an arbitrator decide to which union the workers wished to belong. At least one analyst characterized the agreement as \\"SEIU surrendered most of the assets of the venerable splinter union it had tried to absorb, and gave up some jurisdiction it had sought...\\" On November 29, 2012, Donald \\"D\\" Taylor was named the new president of UNITE HERE after the retirement of former president John W. Wilhelm. Hands Off, Pants On Hands Off, Pants On is a campaign against sexual harassment in the hotel industry in Chicago. The campaign was led by UNITE HERE Local 1. In 2016, the union conducted a survey of about 500 hotel workers. It found that 58 percent of hotel employees and 77 percent of casino workers said they had been sexually harassed. 49 percent of housekeepers claimed to have been subject to indecent exposure. The survey was supposedly in response to a case where a waitress at Neil Bluhm's Rivers Casino was pulled onto the lap of a guest and asked for oral sex. UNITE HERE has proposed legislation that would ban hotel guests who have sexually harassed an employee. The union also supported requiring hotels to give \\"panic buttons\\" to any employees who work alone in guest rooms. Unionized hotels would be exempt from these rules. 2018 Marriott strike UNITE HERE organized a multi-city strike against Marriott Hotels in Fall 2018‚Äî the largest multi-city hotel workers' strike to date. Citing Marriott's failure to negotiate key issues, 8,300 Marriott workers from across the US voted to authorize a strike in September 2018. Workers in San Francisco and Boston were the first to take action on October 3 and 4, followed by workers in San Diego, Oakland, Hawaii, Detroit and San Jose, affecting 23 hotels overall. Workers struck for weeks, often in severe weather conditions, for better job security and living wages. While the specific demands varied from property to property, workers rallied around the idea that \\"One job should be enough,\\" with many citing a need to work two to three jobs in order to make ends meet. In addition to enduring significant pressure from the strike, Marriott also suffered a massive security breach with its Starwood Hotels database as early as September 2018, in which the secure information of 500 million guests may have been compromised. Marriott kept the breach under wraps until news broke on November 30, prompting UNITE HERE leadership to draw parallels between Marriott's lack of accountability and transparency toward both its customer base and its workforce. Settlements began to be reached between Marriott and the various UNITE HERE locals in late November. The last contract was ratified in San Francisco on December 3, with 99.6% of the 2,500 local members voting in favor. Across the country, the newly-ratified contracts included significant increases to wages and other benefits, as well as stronger protections against sexual harassment in the workplace.

The series is set in a fictional village called Ros Na R√∫n, located near to An Spid√©al, and focuses on the domestic and professional lives of its residents. Ros na R√∫n has been praised for its tackling of realistic and socially challenging storylines, which got it dubbed ‚ÄòThe Wild West‚Äò. It has dealt with many different storylines, including domestic violence, infidelity, theft, arson, abortion, homosexuality, adoption, murder, rape, drugs, teen pregnancy and paedophilia. Background Ros na R√∫n was originally devised by RT√â producers Con Bushe and Antoine √ì Flatharta in response to the upcoming centenary of the Gaelic League, with the network deciding upon an Irish language drama as a contribution towards the commemoration of the event. The show originally transmitted on RT√â One in 1992 as a pilot series of twelve minute episodes, though was subsequently discontinued. Ros na R√∫n was later revived as an expanded production for the network launch of Teilif√≠s na Gaeilge (now TG4), first airing on the night of 3 November 1996. The episode filmed scenes in Galway, Dublin and London. The title () plays on the double meaning of the Irish word r√∫n, which has a basic meaning of 'secret' but also has a long history as a term of endearment, similar to \\"honey\\", \\"sweetheart\\", or \\"darling\\". Ros can mean either \\"a wood or wooded headland\\" or \\"a headland or promontory\\", so the title can mean either \\"Wood/Headland of the Secrets\\" or \\"Wood/Headland of the Sweethearts\\". Characters  Storylines  The show begins following the death of Old Jack Padr√°ig, presumed to not have left behind a will. His niece Rita O‚ÄôConnor prepares to move her family from Dublin into her uncle's home in Ros na R√∫n only to find that her cousin Jack Hayes is already occupying the property, leading to a family dispute over its inheritance. Surrounding the circumstances of Old Jack's death is seedy local publican Tadhg √ì Dire√°in, whom Rita recalls being raped by on the night of her hen party seventeen years ago. Rita's son Jason is devastated when he learns that Tadhg is his biological father, though the two later establish a relationship. Other early storylines include the O'Connor family struggling to settle into their new lives in Ros na R√∫n, along with the closure of the Mil R√≠ Chocolate Factory's effect on the local job economy.

The album was completed after the death of frontman Joe Strummer, primarily by Martin Slattery and Scott Shields, and released on 21 October 2003. The album marks the band's transition from their previous genre-bending work to a more straightforward rock album, reminiscent of Strummer's early work with The Clash. The album received a positive critical reception and is generally seen as a return to form and a high point for Strummer to have gone out on. A remastered version of the album along with Strummer's other two Hellcat released albums was released as a special 57 song digital download titled Joe Strummer & The Mescaleros: The Hellcat Years on 21 August 2012 to celebrate what would have been Strummer's 60th birthday. Hellcat also released each remastered album individually on CD and vinyl on 25 September 2012. Song information Due to Strummer's death, many of the vocal performances are first takes. \\"Midnight Jam\\" is completely without lyrics ‚Äì instead, samplings of Joe's BBC Radio show Joe Strummer's London Calling are intermixed with the music. Other tracks, such as a cover of Bob Marley's \\"Redemption Song\\" and \\"Long Shadow\\", were recorded with famed producer Rick Rubin, and it is unclear whether or not these tracks were originally intended to be on this studio album. Another notable track is \\"Long Shadow\\", which was originally written by Strummer for Johnny Cash. Rubin would however get Strummer and Cash, who died a year after Strummer, together in the studio as the two recorded a version of \\"Redemption Song\\" that was featured on Cash's posthumously released Unearthed box set. Music videos were released for the album's two singles, \\"Coma Girl\\" and \\"Redemption Song\\". The video for \\"Redemption Song\\", which was directed by Josh Cheuse who designed the cover art for Strummer's 1989 album, Earthquake Weather and who also appears in the video, is a tribute to Strummer's life and legacy. Filmed in November 2003 in Manhattan in the East Village, the video opens with a clip of Strummer talking from The Clash documentary Westway to the World with the focus of the video being a mural of Strummer that was painted by graffiti artists Zephyr and Dr. Revolt outside of the bar Niagra which is owned by musician, Jesse Malin. The video also features many New Yorkers along with some of Strummer's closest famous friends including Malin, Matt Dillon, Steve Buscemi, Jim Jarmusch, Tim Armstrong, Lars Fredriksen, Matt Freeman, Cara Seymour, Sara Driver and Cinqu√© Lee as they watch the mural being painted.

The market is owned and administrated by the City of London Corporation. The market is Europe's leading horticultural market specialising in exotic fruit and vegetables - and the largest revenue earning wholesale market in the UK.  History  It had previously been located at Spitalfields Market just off Bishopsgate, on the east side of the City of London. Due to traffic congestion, lack of space for parking lorries, as well as out of date market buildings (e.g. poor refrigeration facilities) - the market was relocated out of the City in the early 1990s. This followed the move of Covent Garden Market and Billingsgate Fish Market out of the city centre. The new, purpose built location in Leyton opened in May 1991. The wholesale fruit and vegetable market at Stratford Market - founded in 1879 by the Great Eastern Railway as a competitor to Spitalfields - also closed and consolidated at the New Spitalfields site. The old market on the edge of the City was subsequently regenerated, becoming Old Spitalfields Market - with a range of public markets as well as independent local stores and restaurants.  The market today  The market hall houses 115 trading units for wholesalers dealing in fruit, vegetables and flowers. Modern facilities in the market hall include cold storage rooms, ripening rooms and racking for palletised produce. The site has extensive parking facilities for customers, delivery vehicles and market personnel. There are four separate buildings providing modern self-contained units for catering supply companies. Over of office space is also provided, and there are five ancillary accommodation units with cafes, toilets and maintenance facilities. The services of a diesel/propane supplier, specialist pallet services and forklift truck maintenance companies are also available. Security for the market is provided by the Market Constabulary. The Old River Lea runs on the western edge of the site. Future In early 2019, it was proposed in plans put forward by the Court of Common Council, the City of London Corporation's main decision-making body, that Billingsgate Fish Market, New Spitalfields Market, and Smithfield Market would move to a new consolidated site at Barking Reach.https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/historic-smithfield-market-to- move-after-800-years-in-central-london-a4126721.html See also *List of markets in London References External links *New Spitalfields Market on the City of London website *Spitalfields Market Tenants‚Äô Association Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Waltham Forest Wholesale markets in London Food markets in the United Kingdom Leyton ","title":"New Spitalfields Market"},{"id":"981426","text":"The animistic fallacy is the informal fallacy of arguing that an event or situation necessarily arose because someone intentionally acted to cause it. While it could be that someone set out to effect a specific goal, the fallacy appears in an argument that states this must be the case. The name of the fallacy comes from the animistic belief that changes in the physical world are the work of conscious spirits.  Examples Thomas Sowell in his book Knowledge and Decisions (1980) presents several arguments as examples of the animistic fallacy: * that people earn wealth always because of superior choices * that central planning is necessary to prevent chaos in society Sowell repeatedly dismisses the necessity that order comes from design, and notes that fallacious animistic arguments tend to provide explanations that require comparatively little time to implement. In this light he contrasts the six-day creation of the world described in the Bible to the development of life over billions of years described by evolution.

It is an interdisciplinary field with a wide scope of study. It focuses on combining and incorporating existing and developing theories of psychology non-experimentally. Theoretical psychology originated from the philosophy of science, with logic and rationality at the base of each new idea. It existed before empirical or experimental psychology. Theoretical psychology is an interdisciplinary field involving psychologists specializing in a wide variety of psychological branches. There have been a few prominent pioneers of theoretical psychology such as Wilhelm Wundt, William James, Sigmund Freud, and John B. Watson. There has also been a number of notable contributors which include Jerome Kagan, Alan E. Kazdin, Robert Sternberg, Kenneth J. Gergen, and Ulric Neisser. These contributors often publish in a variety of journals including the most prominent for theoretical psychology, the Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology. Many other organizations are beginning to recognize theoretical psychology as a formal subdivision of psychology. Origin Theoretical psychology emerged from philosophy, more specifically, from the philosophy of science. Philosophy strives to understand nature and structure of concepts, the laws in which these concepts occur, and the theories that combine the laws together. One of these specific branches of philosophy of science is theoretical psychology. Philosophy of science does not use the scientific method to empirically derive ideas about the physical world through conducting experiments and interpreting results. However, it is still about science with an emphasis on the logic and rationality behind science itself, bringing to light what cannot be explained by empirical measures. It is also metaphysically and epistemologically focused on all humans while incorporating the nature and essence of human knowledge. Just as the philosophy of science is to science, theoretical psychology is to psychology in that it is the logic and rationality applied to concepts, laws, and theories. Theoretical psychology is not in place to discern which theories are more truthful or more correctly. Many consider theoretical psychology as the support or rationalization of an \\"idea\\" within psychological theory that is more \\"truthful\\". However, this is not the case. Theoretical psychology is scientifically grounded in ideas of what is known through epistemology. Theoretical psychology existed long before any branches of traditional empirical and experimental psychology. Because of this, there is much more depth and breadth of knowledge from which to draw. This also makes it less common for new developments to come about in the present day because many \\"new\\" approaches are drawing from and revitalizing past theories. This brings new knowledge, frames of reference, and mindsets to these foundational theories. This may be due to Ideas taking longer to develop and gain momentum than related fields in empirical based psychology. Relationship to philosophy and scope Theoretical psychology is a rational, non-experimental approach to psychology. In psychology, as with any field of study, there are three philosophical perspectives and methodologies of ways to derive knowledge about the reality of the world. Rationalism (use of intellect and reason of the mind), Empiricism (use of our individually experienced sensorium), and Skepticism (knowledge beyond mere appearance that is not able to be studied) characterize the three perspectives in understanding theoretical concepts relating to laws which help to understand larger theoretical theories. Of the philosophical perspectives, rationalism is the most pertinent to this discipline of psychology. Theoretical psychology is not experimental or clinically based and focuses on non-experimental ways to acquire knowledge about psychological topics. It explores the theoretical knowledge behind its encompassed ideologies. Oftentimes this includes, but is not limited to, non- experimental critiques to different schools of thought, and the usefulness of psychological concepts. Theoretical psychology is a discipline that bases its information through inference, as opposed to empirically acquired information. Hypotheses are then exchanged and further built upon from different perspectives. Theoretical Psychology also deals with manipulating non- scientific, common words (hypothetical constructs) into scientifically objective terms (intervening variables). Theoretical psychology requires full agreement on the different viewpoints to be able to see the point as a theory. As a result, many of its topics remain in continuous debate. Theoretical psychology is the logic of psychology and all of its components. This means when theories within psychology oppose or compete, theoretical psychology does not select which is correct. It describes the nature and composition of psychology's many ideas. To explain the logic of psychology, there has been a conclusion of the principles belonging to the three classified areas. Psychology is built on the principle of being able to reference observable behavior, physical environment, and/or physiological states. Theoretical psychology is an important aspect that continues to play a role in modern psychology. While there are some downfalls to theoretical psychology, there are also strengths and benefits it brings to the field.Lucey, K. (2015). Pesky essays on the logic of philosophy. Reno, Nevada: Springer. The scope that theoretical psychology covers is vast. Professionals have the opportunity to use this method of seeking out theoretical knowledge to begin research in a variety of subjects. This allows for a great deal of knowledge to be explored by means of inference rather than seeking out tangible data to draw ideas. Theoretical psychology is an interdisciplinary field involving psychologists specializing in cognitive psychology, social psychology, developmental psychology, personality psychology, clinical psychology, perceptual psychology, neuropsychology, biological psychology, evolutionary psychology, historical psychology, economic psychology, political psychology, and critical psychology. It is important to acknowledge these fields do not discount empiricism, but rather explore new ideas with a theoretical approach first. Pioneers A brief history into the field of theoretical psychology includes some prominent pioneers. To begin, Wilhelm Wundt (1874) originally worked as a professor of philosophy. His focus was on the subjective study of an individual's consciousness, he believed that this was a key factor to the field of psychology. This aspect of psychology was unable to be shown with a large amount of empirical evidence, but remained a theory throughout the history of Psychology. Next, William James (1890) worked as a psychologist and a philosopher. His career focused around the idea of free will, which is theoretical in nature. He also assisted in forming the James-Lange theory of emotion, which is based upon many theoretical factors. Sigmund Freud (1905) was also an important pioneer for theoretical psychology. Freud founded the psychoanalytic theory of psychology. He did not rely on empirical data when making his theories, but instead looked for philosophical explanations. Freud often shared his view that he did not need empirical evidence for his theory, because he simply knew it is true. Another pioneer was John B. Watson (1913). Watson founded the theory of behaviorism in psychology through the article \\"Psychology as a Behaviorist Views It\\". Although Behaviorism has a strong emphasis on empirical psychology, forming the methods cannot be empirically tested, and is therefore considered theoretical psychology. Notable contributors There are some notable individuals that have, and continue to make a large impact on theoretical psychology. Jerome Kagan's (1971) work on personality traits and aging, emotion, and temperament could be considered theoretical psychology due to Kagen dedicating much of his work to psychology constructs, specifically to the developmental psychology. As a science gains new empirical procedures it also generates new information. Donald Meichenbaum (1977) had work that focused on cognitive behavioral therapy. Meichenbaum did the majority of his work in the field of cognitive psychology. He compared his theory to Pandora's box. Its main focus is connecting cognitive processes and relations to things such as clients' feelings, behavior, and consequences of these. It also factors in physiologic and social cultural processes. Alan E. Kazdin (1980) had theories that focuses on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as a style in children and adolescence. He focuses on child and adolescent psychopathologies such as depression and conduct problems. His writings on research strategies and methods have set a high standard for rigor in the field. Robert Sternberg's (1990) main focus revolves around some theoretical idea that include; creativity, wisdom, thinking styles, love, and hate. Sternberg often includes politically charged articles that focus on admissions testing and general intelligence. He performed both empirically driven and theoretical work. Kenneth J. Gergen's (1991) work on social psychology as history was used towards generative theories, realities and relationships, the saturated self, positive aging, and relational being. He included many theoretical ideas such as culture and science, assumptions, views on mental illness, and relations. Many of his idea's were theoretical in nature. Ulric Neisser(1995) has work that's related to cognitive psychology, specifically the idea of flashbulb memories. Although he used empirical data to test this idea, he originally took the concept from theoretical work. These individual's and many others continue to impact psychology with theoretical ideas that may or may not be yet supported by empirical data. Modern organizational support The American Psychological Association has the division of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology as Division 24. Theoretical Ideas are also associated to the division of humanistic psychology (32). According to the American Psychological Association, \\"Division 24: Society for Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology encourages and facilitates informed exploration and discussion of psychological theories and issues in both their scientific and philosophical dimensions and interrelationships.\\" The International Society for Theoretical Psychology, the Section of History and Philosophy of Psychology (25) of the Canadian Psychological Society, the Section of History and Philosophy of psychology of the British Psychological Society, the International Human Science Conference, and the Society for Philosophy and Psychology also offer organizational support. Universities that currently have Theoretical Psychology/Human Science programs include Duquesne University, the University of Dallas, Seattle University, West Georgia College, University of Calgary, University of Alberta, York University, Brigham Young University, University of Notre Dame, And Georgetown University. Research methods Theoretical psychology works together with empirical psychology to form a symbiotic relationship. Theoretical psychology is not constrained by empirical research or laboratory studies. It allows for scientists to freely search for knowledge that we have yet to be able to study empirically or are not yet capable of studying empirically. For theoretical psychology, its strength lies in the realm of rationality, focused on big picture ideas. However, on its own it is not a complete way to gain particular knowledge of reality. This is where the empirical based branches of psychology has strength. Theoretical psychology can more heavily rely on an idea about human nature that is universal, even when it is not known why or how this particular trend happens in the world, either individualistically or collectively. Empirical psychology is what allows for humans to make insights on these big picture ideas at a more palatable, applicable and individualistic and way that gives practical information about reality. Theoretical psychology is not a universal psychological theory able to explain all topics without the use of empirical research. Theoretical psychology is not fundamental or comprehensive theory of psychology, rather, for theoretical psychology to operate correctly it is important to supplement empirical psychology and give reason to topics and produce theories until they can be empirically verified by the other branches of psychology. Issues in methodology and practice Humans have innate wonder, exploring many topics through experience and perception. From this wonder, individuals rationally reflects on their own experiences about a specific topic. Then the individual practices dialectics, examining what others have said about the topic being explored with the hopes of finding a particular knowledge about the topic. Theoretical psychology serves as the bridge between the philosophical roots of psychology and the present day empirical psychology. This bridge has an emphasis and focus on forming concepts from moments of explicit behavior that are observable, excluding introspective mental events within individual consciousness. Psychological laws are created from these observable behaviors that are derived from one concept that also contain concepts from the individual's environment of internal physiological states. These laws are categorized into causal (statistical) or deterministic/mechanistic (nonstatistical) categories which relate simultaneous parallel traits or predict future from present or past respectively. Then these laws are organized into theories based on connections logically deduced together and open to new laws yet to be discovered or empirically verified. The ultimate and logically possible goal of theoretical psychology is to create an exact and comprehensive psychological theory. However, the concepts that are immediately observable are still abstract and difficult to define even in a basic law in an important solid theory as they relate to no physical object we can make sense of or interact with using our sensorium and empirical approaches. They are not instantiated in the world and in virtue of this they are called theoretical concepts. Significance Theoretical psychology has many aspects that can be viewed as positive or negative, which depends on the interpreter. Theoretical psychology can play an important and also unique role in the field such that almost any claim can be reasonably thought of as true if it is theoretically appealing and empirically supported by research. Theorists must be strategic and knowledgeable when shifting through experimental psychology as the field grows. This can be beneficial in the sense that individuals know theorists have made a deliberated effort when analyzing the research surrounding a theory. However, for those who are not familiar with the theoretical psychology surrounding a theory, the abundant amount of information contributing to a theory can be overwhelming. In addition, theories can be extremely resistant to change. As theories compete, and different evidence emerges, prior theories can be extremely difficult to change. This can make it difficult for new theories to gain traction within the field of psychology. This resiliency may in part be due to theories stated in ways that are worded too abstractly, ineffectively, and contradictory at times. One challenge of theoretical psychology is the difficulty to explain consciousness: there are many competing theories revolving around consciousness, and theoretical psychology struggles to fully explain or justify consciousness. Researchers have an extremely difficult time studying it, despite there being an entire field of psychology completely dedicated to consciousness. Theoretical psychology can be extremely beneficial because it brings together scientific ideas and philosophical ideas of psychology. Integrating these ideas contributes to the knowledge of psychology. Journals The fields of humanistic and existential, as well as the Social Constructionist perspective of psychology, all have been fundamental to some of the first theoretical ideas as it pertains to modern theoretical psychology.

He is sometimes called the \\"Father of Brazilian Rock\\" and \\"Maluco Beleza\\", the last one roughly translated as \\"Groovy Nutcase\\". He was born in Salvador (Bahia), Brazil, and died of pancreatitis in S√£o Paulo. Every year on Seixas' birthday, legions of fans, including thousands of impersonators (many even changing their last name to Seixas as a sign of idolatry), throw a parade in his honor in downtown S√£o Paulo. His body of work consists of 21 albums released along his 26-year career. His musical style is mostly rock and ballad, although he wrote songs in many different styles, including variations of styles typical of his native Northeast Brazil like Forr√≥ and Bai√£o, and in fact often used more than one style in the same song, such as in \\"Let Me Sing, Let Me Sing\\". His debut album, Raulzito e os Panteras, was produced when he was part of a band of the same name. However, he only gained prominence and critical audience with songs from the album Krig-H√°, Bandolo! (1973), such as \\"Ouro de Tolo\\" (\\"Fool's Gold\\"), \\"Mosca na Sopa\\" (\\"Fly in the Soup\\"), and \\"Metamorfose Ambulante\\" (\\"Walking Metamorphosis\\"). Raul Seixas developed a musical style that emphasized the maverick and the mystic. His album Gita (1974), influenced by figures such as Aleister Crowley, expresses his views very directly. Many songs in Gita were co-written with his frequent collaborator, then-fellow mystic and future worldwide bestselling author Paulo Coelho. Raul was interested in philosophy (especially metaphysics and ontology), psychology, history, literature and Latin. In October 2008, nineteen years after his death, Raul Seixas was placed in 19th position in a list of one hundred greatest artists of Brazilian music sponsored by the Brazilian edition of Rolling Stone magazine, topping the likes of Milton Nascimento, Maria Beth√¢nia, Heitor Villa-Lobos and others, demonstrating the influence that Seixas' music continues to hold today.  Biography  Raul Seixas, 1972. Seixas was born at 8 A.M on 28 June 1945 to a middle-class family residing at Avenida Sete de Setembro, Salvador, Bahia. As a child living near the United States consulate, he became fluent in the English language, and was introduced to early rock and roll records of artists such as Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley through his contacts with American diplomats' children around 1956. Elvis's music in particular was influential in young Raul's decision to become a musician. At the age of twelve, Seixas formed his first group, The Panthers, later changing their name to the Portuguese-language Raulzito e os Panteras (\\"Little Raul and The Panthers\\"). They appeared on TV Salvador doing covers of Lewis, Little Richard and Elvis, a style of music which was at the time called \\"cowboy music\\" in Brazil. They were also the first group in the state of Bahia to play Beatles covers and grow their hair long, as early as 1964. In the mid-1960s, Os Panteras, already well known as the best rock group in the region, started backing some of Brazil's most famous pop singers of the time, such as Roberto Carlos and Jerry Adriani whenever they went to Salvador. Impressed with their talent, the stars would always advise Raul to move down south and take a chance in the thriving Jovem Guarda scene. Following the promises of fame and fortune, the band moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1967. In the following year they released their first and only album on the Odeon label (later EMI-Odeon), which included a Portuguese language version of the Beatles' song \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" among many original numbers. Without any publicity, the record sunk and the band disbanded. Seixas was totally shaken by the failure of the Panthers, and his return to Salvador. He wrote: \\"I spent all day locked in his room reading philosophy, with only a feeble light well, which I ended up spoiling the view [...] I bought a motorcycle and do crazy things in the street.\\" After his former bandmates moved back to Salvador, Seixas made a living as an English teacher before being hired by CBS, still in 1968, as creative director and record producer. In 1971, tired of writing and producing records by bland, commercial artists, he took advantage of a label director's vacations and produced Sociedade da Gr√£-Ordem Kavernista Apresenta Sess√£o das Dez, an avant- garde album featuring himself, singer Sergio Sampaio, samba artist Miriam Batucada and Edy Star. The record's mix of Tropicalia, rock and roll and anarchic surrealistic experiments launched Raul Seixas as an icon of Brazilian counterculture. Document of Censorship evaluating the song \\"O Exerc√≠cio\\" of Raul Seixas and Paulo Coelho, 1973. In the 1970s, Seixas became popular in urban centers such as Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo. Music broadcast on TV and radio was satirical, sarcastic with esoteric themes. References to a wide range of historical and fictional personalities are found within his lyrics: The Beatles, Aleister Crowley, Al Capone, Marlon Brando, Jesus, Julius Caesar and Shakespeare, for example. Seixas was subject to censorship during Brazil's period of military dictatorship. Like the music of his contemporaries such as Chico Buarque and others, Seixas's lyrics hide political messages within double meanings. 1971 also saw the beginning of a relationship with esoteric author Paulo Coelho, beginning with Krig-H√°-Bandolo in 1973. Through Coelho, Seixas was introduced to the work of controversial English mystic Aleister Crowley, which influenced their collaboration. The influence extended not only to music, but also to plans for the creation of the \\"Alternative Society,\\" which was to be an anarchist community in the state of Minas Gerais based on Crowley's premise: \\"'Do what thou wilt' shall be the whole of the Law.\\" The project was considered subversive by members of the Brazilian military, which imprisoned all prospective members of the group. Seixas and Coelho are reported to have been tortured during their imprisonment. Seixas got into self-exiling himself in the United States following the presumed detention by government repressive agents, where his American wife of the time was living. (Seixas was legally married two times to Edith Wisner and Gloria Vaquer Seixas.) He has three daughters Simone Vannoy, Scarlet Vaquer Seixas and Vivian Seixas. He would later claim that during his exile he had met his childhood heroes John Lennon and Jerry Lee Lewis, although this claim has been disputed. Perhaps as a result of his drug addiction and alcoholism, the rate and quality of Seixas' releases slowed through the late-1970s and throughout the 1980s. In later life Seixas suffered from diabetes and pancreatitis. On 21 August 1989 Seixas died of cardiac arrest, the result of acute pancreatitis brought on by his diabetes and not having taken insulin the night before. His final album, A Panela do Diabo, a partnership with fellow Bahian rocker Marcelo Nova (former leader of punk rock band Camisa de V√™nus) was released two days before his death. It is very common to hear people shouting \\"Toca Raul!\\" (Play Raul!) in the middle of concerts, regardless of the artist or genre, just like the requests for Free Bird.

Life Bruno Maderna was born Bruno Grossato in Venice but later decided to take the name of his mother, Caterina Carolina Maderna.Interview with Maderna‚Äòs three children Caterina, Claudia and Andreas Maderna, Heidelberg 2019 At the age of four he began studying the violin with his grandfather. \\"My grandfather thought that if you could play the violin you could then do anything, even become the biggest gangster. If you play the violin you are always sure of a place in heaven.\\" As a child he played several instruments (violin, drums and accordion) in his father's small variety band. A child prodigy, in the early thirties he was not only performing violin concertos, he was already conducting orchestral concerts: first with the orchestra of La Scala in Milan, then in Trieste, Venice, Padua and Verona. Orphaned at the age of four,. Maderna was adopted by a wealthy woman from Verona, Irma Manfredi, who saw that he received a solid musical education. He took private lessons in harmony and musical composition from Arrigo Pedrollo in 1935‚Äì37 and studied composition with Alessandro Bustini at the Rome Conservatory in 1937‚Äì40. After Rome he returned to Venice, where he attended the advanced course for composers (1940‚Äì42) organised by Gian Francesco Malipiero at the Benedetto Marcello Conservatory (his Concerto for Piano and Orchestra dates from this time). He also studied conducting with Antonio Guarnieri at the Accademia Chigiana in Siena (1941) and Hermann Scherchen in Venice (1948). Through Scherchen Maderna discovered twelve-tone technique and the music of the Second Viennese School. During the Second World War he took part in the partisan resistance. From 1948 to 1952 he taught music theory at the Venice Conservatory. During this period he collaborated with Malipiero on critical editions of Italian early music. Fellow composers he met at this time included Luigi Dallapiccola and, at the Internationale Ferienkurse f√ºr Neue Musik, Boulez, Messiaen, Cage, Pousseur, Nono and Stockhausen.  Conductor/teacher  In 1950 Maderna started an international career as a conductor, first in Paris and Munich, then across Europe. In 1955 he founded the Studio di fonologia musicale di Radio Milano with Luciano Berio; and Incontri musicali, a series of concerts disseminating contemporary music in Italy. With his later wife Beate Christina Koepnick, a young actress from Darmstadt, Maderna had three children. In 1957‚Äì58, at the invitation of Giorgio Federico Ghedini, he taught at the Milan Conservatory, and between 1960 and 1962 he lectured at Dartington International Summer School in England. From 1961 to 1966, Maderna and Pierre Boulez were the main directors of the International Kranichsteiner Kammerensemble in Darmstadt. Despite this heavy workload throughout these years Maderna found time to compose. During the 1960s and '70s he spent much time in the United States, teaching and conducting. In 1971‚Äì72 he was appointed director of new music at Tanglewood. In 1972‚Äì73 he became the principal conductor of the Orchestra Sinfonica of RAI in Milan. Maderna died of lung cancer in Darmstadt in 1973. A number of composers wrote pieces in Maderna's memory, including Pierre Boulez (Rituel in memoriam Bruno Maderna)and Luciano Berio (Calmo for voice and orchestra). Earle Brown's Centering, dedicated to the memory of Maderna, ends with a short quotation from Maderna's First Oboe Concerto. Work Maderna composed much music in all genres: instrumental, chamber, concertos and electronic, as well as large amounts of incidental music (for theatre and radio) and transcriptions and editions of early music. At the heart of Maderna's output are a number of concertos, including one for violin, one for two pianos, two for solo piano and several for flute and orchestra. He was particularly drawn to the oboe, composing three concertos in all: the first in 1962‚Äì63 followed by two more in 1967 and 1973. Other major orchestral works include Aura and Biogramma (both 1967) and Quadrivium, for four percussionists and four orchestral groups (premiered at the 1969 Royan Festival). Giuseppe Sinopoli recorded all three of these pieces with the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra in 1979. Maderna's Requiem, composed between 1944 and 1946, was rediscovered and performed in 2009; the American composer Virgil Thomson saw an unfinished version of the score in 1946 and praised it as a masterpiece. Bruno Maderna also produced scores for eight films and two documentaries. The last of these was for Giulio Questi's thriller La morte ha fatto l'uovo in 1968.

The village has a population of 1,979. On Church Street, there is a well-preserved tithe barn, which is used by local organisations including the playgroup, badminton club and a Morris dancing side (Dr Turberville's Morris). The village is home to Merriott Rovers F.C. who play in the Perry Street and District League, spanning Somerset, Dorset and Devon. Also situated in Merriott is a Co-op and all-purpose food store. It has two pubs: the 17th century King's Head and the 19th century Swan. The parish boundary includes the River Parrett which is crossed by the Bow Bridge. Next to it is Bow Mill House, with its attached watermill which dates from the 17th century. Tail Mill was used for sail cloth manufacture. History The name Merriott means boundary gate from the Old English Maergeat. The manor was held at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 by Harding son of Eadnorth whose descendants took the name of the village and continued until the death of Sir John de Meriet in 1391. The good quality of the soil led to the development of market-gardening, with the first use in England of the word nursery (noresire) occurred at Merriot in 1369. The parish was part of the hundred of Crewkerne. Major rebuilding took place in the village following a fire in 1811. The school building dates from 1876, and now incorporates the former Sunday school which was built in 1834. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non- metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Chard Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. The village falls within Eggwood electoral ward. Merriott is the most populous area but the ward stretches to Dinnington in the west. The total population for this ward taken at the 2011 census was 2,421. It is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Religious sites The Anglican parish Church of All Saints dates from the 13th century, with modifications in the late 15th or early 16th century, and major restoration including the extension of the nave, a new chancel and chapels by Benjamin Ferrey in 1860. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building. Notable people * Francis Trask (1840 ‚Äì 6 April 1910) was a 20th-century Member of the New Zealand Legislative Council and Mayor of Nelson.

Overview The stories take place on the American frontier in the early 19th century, a fantasy setting based on early American folklore and superstition, in a world in which many characters have a limited supernatural ability, or ‚Äúknack,‚Äù to do some task to near-perfection. The stories involve a number of historical events and figures, but as a creation of alternate history. What was documented as the Colonial United States is divided in the books into a number of separate nations, including a smaller United States. It displays much stronger Native American influence in its culture and society between New England and Virginia and extending westwards to Ohio. (New England is a colony of a Republican England where the Restoration never occurred.) A monarchy on the southern portion of the Eastern Seaboard (where the real-world Carolinas, Georgia, _etc._ are) known as the ‚ÄúCrown Colonies‚Äù was founded by the House of Stuart in exile. In addition, many of the historical figures are either presented as caricatures or bear only superficial resemblance to their historical persons. Some of the historical figures are also accorded knacks, such as Benjamin Franklin (not a character, but repeatedly mentioned), who is said to have been a Maker, and Napoleon, who has the abilities both to make others adore and obey him and to see others‚Äô great ambitions. Famous Native American Indian figures include Tecumseh, who is called ‚ÄúTa Kumsaw‚Äù in the books. His brother Tensquatawa is also featured, as ‚ÄúTenskwa Tawa.‚Äù The characters in the book display features similar to the two famous Native Americans. The famous Battle of Tippecanoe, in which both brothers were involved, occurs in the book, although its outcome is different from the historic one.

He can change both living and nonliving matter simply by force of will (hence the title \\"Maker\\"). This power comes at a cost, however; not only does Alvin feel a great responsibility to use his power for good, but there are forces that actively seek his death. Alvin must discover how to use his abilities, and how to apply them for good, while struggling to survive. Along the way, he is helped by a number of people whose knacks are not as strong, but who see in Alvin a way to use their wisdom and abilities to contribute to a greater good. Some people try to misguide him or exploit his abilities for their own purposes. =Alternate history characters= * William Blake (as the major character Taleswapper) * William Henry Harrison * Andrew Jackson * Napoleon Bonaparte * Marquis de La Fayette * Daniel Webster * Denmark Vesey * John Adams * Abraham Lincoln * Honor√© de Balzac * John James Audubon * Ralph Waldo Emerson * Tecumseh (as Ta Kumsaw) * Tensquatawa (as Lolla-Wossiky/Tenskwa Tawa) *Stephen F.

Essentially, the Unmaker is entropy as a conscious, destructive entity. Aside from opposing all life, the Unmaker is the particular nemesis of Alvin Miller. Alvin is a Maker of exceptional power and prodigious creativity who enriches life by constructing both objects and social bridges, thereby threatening and thwarting the Unmaker. The Unmaker repeatedly attempts to do away with Alvin, at first by inducing accidents at Alvin's childhood (especially by drowning, since eroding water has a natural affinity to it), and later by influencing people to challenge and repudiate him. To make something is to oppose the Unmaker, but a point often made is that this is futile. By natural law the Unmaker can tear down faster than any man can build. On the other hand, Making cares nothing about natural law. As Taleswapper reveals to a seven-year-old Alvin, the creation of what's known as the Crystal City could defeat, even destroy, the Unmaker. This then becomes Alvin's mission in life. The Unmaker is usually undetectable to most people, though Alvin can detect its attention as a shimmering around his field of vision. It manifests when it needs to in order to tempt people into war and destruction, in which case it takes the most effective shape; a priest would see an avenging angel, a slave-owner a great overseer, etc. It won't appear to those who destroy willingly - they serve its cause already. Themes =Mormonism= Alvin has characteristics similar to the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Joseph Smith (Card is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ); some of the events in Seventh Son are similar to those of Smith's childhood. Alvin has visions of creating a Crystal City, which is similar to the Church settlement of Nauvoo, Illinois. Alvin has had premonitions that he may die after building the Crystal City, which suggests Smith's death in Carthage. Alvin was also the name of Joseph Smith's eldest brother. =Race= Race also plays a large part in the stories, particularly in the way that culture shapes the abilities that people of different groups develop. \\"Whites\\" have knacks or cultivated skills that appear to be derived from the folklore and traditions of colonial America and western Europe. \\"Reds\\" align themselves with the rhythms of nature but also use blood to perform some of their magic. \\"Blacks\\" channel their skills into creating objects of power, in a manner similar to the practices of voodoo. =Conflict= A recurring theme of the books is the conflict between Creators and Destroyers‚Äînamely, Making such as Alvin does, and Unmaking that he confronts.

He served as Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1861 to 1870. Early life Monro was born in Edinburgh. His father was Alexander Monro, a lecturer at the Edinburgh Medical College. Monro was from a long line of doctors, the Monro of Fyrish family that was a branch of clan Munro. He graduated as a Doctor of Medicine from his father's college in 1835. After first studying for a time in Paris, Berlin and Vienna, Monro established a medical practice in Edinburgh. In 1841, however, Monro bought land in the planned settlement at Nelson, New Zealand. He arrived in Nelson the following year. Monro married Dinah Secker on 7 May 1845 and they had five sons and two daughters, including Charles Monro. His daughter, Maria Georgiana Monro, married the Scottish geologist, naturalist, and surgeon James Hector. Political career In 1843, following the Wairau Affray, Monro was chosen (along with Alfred Domett, later to become Premier) to present the Nelson settlers' views to Willoughby Shortland, the acting Governor. Partly as a result of this attention, Monro was appointed to the Legislative Council of the New Munster Province in 1849, but resigned after a dispute with Governor George Grey. In 1853, Monro was elected to the 1st New Zealand Parliament, representing the seat of Waimea. He was re-elected in the same seat for the 2nd Parliament in 1858. At the beginning of the 3rd Parliament, to which Monro had been elected as representative of Picton, he was selected as Speaker. He is generally regarded as having conducted this duty \\"with dignity\\", although his use of the Speaker's casting vote to unseat Premier William Fox in 1862 was controversial. At the 1866 general election, he successfully contested the Cheviot electorate. Monro remained Speaker until 1870, when he announced that he would step down. William Fox, who was once again Premier, failed to move the traditional vote of thanks. Monro contested the Motueka seat in the 1871 elections, and was declared elected. A subsequent petition, however, overturned this result. The committee that made the ruling had a government majority, and some of its findings have been deemed \\"legally dubious\\" ‚Äì many believe that the decision was taken for political reasons. Furthermore, a proposal to appoint Monro to the Legislative Council was blocked by Fox. Monro nevertheless succeeded in re-entering Parliament through a 1872 by-election in Waikouaiti. After the Fox government had been defeated, Monro resigned in 1873. Life outside politics Warwick House as seen from Brougham Street For some time, Monro leased Warwick House, at the time known as Sunnyside. The house was built for Arthur Fell (father of Charles Fell) in 1854 by builder David Goodall. When Fell returned to England, Monro leased the house. Later, the house was bought by Nathaniel Edwards. The building at 64 Brougham Street in Nelson is one of the finest and largest examples of early Victorian Gothic Revivalism still remaining in New Zealand. At one time, the house had about 50 rooms. The building was registered on 25 November 1982 as Category II with Heritage New Zealand, with registration number 1618. Monro was knighted in 1866. He died at his home, Newstead (now known as Renwick House), in Nelson, New Zealand, on 15 February 1877. The perennial herb endemic to New Zealand Myosotis monroi is named after him.

Though romanized in a number of ways when written, K«ímdo or Geomdo, the meaning remains \\"the way of the sword\\" and is cognate with the Japanese term. As a martial art, Kumdo has become accepted in Korean culture and society since its introduction from Japan to the degree that the term \\"kumdo\\" has, in recent history, become a generic label for other Korean martial arts based upon Korean Swordsmanship. Therefore, kumdo can apply to the sporting and competitive form of swordsmanship, similar to Kendo, or it can be applied to other martial forms of Korean swordsmanship such as Haidong Gumdo or Hankumdo. Although related to Japanese Kendo, minor differences exist in Korean Kumdo due to appropriation and acculturation. Such differences include, but are not limited to, the use of native terminology, the use of blue flags rather than red flags for the referees and minor modifications to the uniform. History In April, 1895 the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (DNBK) was established in Kyoto, Japan for the preservation of older Martial activities such as sword, archery and unarmed combat. Swordsmen in Japan had established schools of kenjutsu (lit: \\"sword techniques\\") over centuries of military heritage and this material formed the basis for the DNBK swordwork. The introduction of bamboo practice swords and armor to sword training is attributed to Naganuma Shir≈çzaemon Kunisato, of the Jikishinkage-ry≈´ during the Shotoku Era. (1711‚Äì1715). In 1896, the DNBK expanded to Korea as the Dai Nippon Butokukai - Choson-bu (Korean Branch) under Nakamura, Tokichi. Japanese Swordsmanship Kenjutsu, like Judo, was adapted to the Japanese educational system in 1911 at the prodding of Naito Takaharu and Isogai Hajime, both of the DNBK, since the use of a pliant bamboo sword and padded armour allowed competitors to strike each other with sword techniques in greater safety. The DNBK changed the name of this sporting form of swordsmanship, first called gekiken, (Ky≈´jitai: ÊìäÂäç; Shinjitai: ÊíÉÂâ£, \\"hitting sword\\") to Kendo in 1920. Korea, then subject to Japanese policy and administration, also adopted these practices but often using Korean rather than Japanese terminology. Made a required course in Korean schools in 1939, Kendo continued to be taught until 1945. After WWII, Kumdo and Kendo diverged to form separate but nearly identical practices. The following is a brief historical time-line of Kumdo development. * 1895 In April, 1895 the Dai Nippon Butokukai, or ‚ÄúAll Japan Martial Virtue Society‚Äù had been established in Kyoto by civilian enthusiasts of various traditional Japanese arts such as Archery, Ju-jutsu and Ken-jutsu.An Apologetic for the DNBK, 1947; Svinth, Joseph R.; Nov 22, 2002 * 1895 As many as 40 Japanese advisors are brought into Korea, several of which are placed with the national police administration. As part of the restructuring of the national Korean police indicated in the Kabo Reforms of 1894, cadets at the Kyongmuchong or Police Academy are required to learn \\"kyok gom\\" (J. \\"gekki ken\\") or \\"combat swordsmanship\\" as one of its training subjects. * 1896 The Dai Nippon Butokukai (DNBK), Chosen-bu (Korean Branch) under Nakamura, Tokichi, is established. * 1904 Training in Japanese military sword (K. \\"kyok gom\\") is included in the curriculum of the Yonsong Army Academy. * 1906 Gekiken introduced into Korean school curriculum * 1908 a tournament held between the Korean police and their Japanese counterparts. Gekiken was also included in the first official national physical education program for the general public. * 1910 Japanese annexation/occupation of Korea. * 1919 According to Japanese records, the term Kendo is coined in Japan on August 1, 1919. * 1927 Kumdo becomes an official curricular subject in junior high schools. * 1935 Kumdo included in the 16th National Joseon Sports Festival * 1945 Korean liberation from Japanese occupation. * 1947 Korean kumdo begins restructuring and distancing from Japanese disciplines with the holding of the Seoul Police Kumdo Tournament * 1948 Approximately 100 highly-ranked kumdo instructors gathered in Changdeokgung Palace and formed the predecessor to the Korean Kumdo Association * 1950 The 1st National Police Kumdo Tournament was held * 1952 A committee was created to oversee the formation of the KKA * 1953 The KKA was inaugurated and became affiliated with the Korean Amateur Sports Association * The 1st National Individual Kumdo Championships were held (Same year that the All Japan Kendo Federation was formed) * 1956 Kumdo was once more included as an official event of the National Sports Festival after a break of 20 years * 1959 Kumdo became increasingly popular with the President‚Äôs Cup Grade Category Tournament, and the National Student Championships * 1964 The Student Kumdo Federation became affiliated with the KKA * 1970 The Student Federation separated into the Collegiate Federation and the Secondary Schools Federation. The International Kendo Federation was formed and a Korean named as Vice President * 1972 Kumdo was included in the National Youth Sports Meet * 1979 The news agency Dong Ilbo joined forces with the KKA in sponsoring the President‚Äôs Cup National Championships * 1988 The Korean Social Kumdo Federation was formed and followed by the 1st National Social Championships * 1993 Inauguration of the SBS Royal National Championships  Today  = Philosophy = As with Martial Arts practices around the World, Korean Kumdo is imbued with cultural and philosophical thought of both current society and the historic past. In this way the sport aspects of Kumdo practice seek to build strong Character in its practitioners, while good Character in turn contributes to an ardent competitive spirit while respecting tenets of courtesy, respect, sportsmanship and fair-play. Though Kumdo is of modern vintage, Kumdo schools still invoke the \\"O-Gae\\" or \\"Five tenets\\" associated with the Silla kingdom of The Three Kingdoms Period. The modern rendition of this code is as follows. ::\\"Be loyal and faithful to your country and organization. ::Be faithful and respectful to your parents and elders. ::Be faithful and respectful to your friends and colleagues. ::Be confident and show courage when faced with injustice. ::Be benevolent.\\" In the modern era, additional tenets have been added, often reflecting challenges common to competition. Known as \\"the Four Poisons of Kumdo\\" these include Surprise, Fear, Doubt (or Hesitation) and Confusion. Regular and ardent practice is encouraged to steadily bring these natural responses under control. Similarly, Kumdo practitioners seek to develop a state termed \\"emptiness (K. Pyoungsangsim) wherein natural execution of method is not impacted by circumstances or environment. Another condition, known as \\"Kiwi\\" --- the state of mental, physical and spiritual discipline--- seeks clarity and objectivity regarding the matter at hand. And Jan Sim (lit. \\"remaining mind\\") concerns steadfastness and perseverance.HwaRang Kumdo Association Student Manual; USA Hwarang Kumdo Association,1999; pg 7-8 =Equipment= The suit of modern Kumdo armor, excepting the scarf which is worn over the scalp inside of the helmet. Protective equipment used in Kumdo is called Hogu()---bogu in Japanese--- and consists of 6 elements. NOT SHOWN.) My≈èn-soo- goon (, \\"tenugui\\" in Japanese): cotton scarf worn under the helmet to absorb perspiration and prevent interference in the competitors' vision. It can also be called a \\"Dougong\\" but not to be mixed up with the Chinese definition. A.) Homyeoun (, \\"men\\" in Japanese): Helmet including a wire grill to protect the face. B.) Kap (, \\"d≈ç\\" in Japanese): Chest protector D.) Kapsang (, \\"tare\\" in Japanese): Canvas and leather skirt worn around the waist to protect the hip and groin area C,E.) Howan (, \\"kote\\" in Japanese):(pair) formed mitts with cuffs used to protect the hand and wrist area. As with any modern contact sport, the use of a mouthguard (K.'eep bohodae') is strongly encouraged. In addition the individual will use a bamboo sword or Juk-To with which to strike or thrust at his opponent while fending off attacks. alt= Areas and parts of the Bamboo Sword. 1.) Pommel: Though identified as a part of the sword it is not accepted as a point of contact in regulation play. 2.) Ko-d√ªng-i: (, \\"tsuba\\" in Japanese) w/ rubber retaining washer: the hilt or guard of the sword is intended to offer some protection to the hands, but is more commonly used as a point of contact in close-quarters contest. 3.) Kalnal: () --- blade of the sword is only suggested as that side of the Juk-To opposite the Duengjul (lit. \\"back cord\\")and the two-thirds portion of the Juk-To forward of the guard. 4.) Duengjul: A yellow string that stretches form the guard to the tip of the sword and signifies the spine of the sword. 5.) Joonghyuk: is the leather band marking the proximal limit of the recognized striking area of the sword. 6.) Sunnhyuk: is the leather cap representing the tip of the sword. Use of thrusts in competition is infrequent but are recognized when contact is made solely with this part of the sword. A.) Byounghyuk: Represents the handle of the sword B.) C.) Ta-dol-bu: The area between the sunnhyuk and the joonghyuk representing the first third of the sword blade. In competition, a strike is counted only when the point of contact is solely with this area of the sword. A standard Juk-To is a 120 cm (47 Inches) for all adults, with the male item weighing 500g and the female item weighing 420g. Traditionally made of 4 bamboo strips and bound with leather, advances in technology have produced items made of high-impact plastics and carbon fibers. Proportionately smaller items are available for child competitors.HwaRang Kumdo Association Student Manual; USA Hwarang Kumdo Association,1999; Sec.4 Lastly a Kumdo practitioner will use a Mok Geom (lit. wooden sword). Though used historically for competition, the potential for injury including the likelihood of death has caused this item to be relegated to highly structured individual and paired form-work as a substitute for using steel swords. =Clothing= Kumdo practitioners wear a Dobok (; lit: \\"clothing for the way\\") or uniform which closely resembles that worn by Kendo practitioners, usually indigo-blue in color. Many Kumdo practitioners wear Paji ( Î∞îÏßÄ; lit. training pants ) with billowy pants legs after the fashion of Japanese hakama without koshiita though the ankles are not secured after the fashion of the Korean Hanbok or traditional dress. A heavy cotton double-weave jacket (K.Otdori; ) is worn and traditionally closed with a tie (K. Maetti√¥p); () though linen ties, after the fashion of Japanese traditions, are giving way to velcro fastenings. A belt (K.Dhee; ), usually signifying the individuals rank or standing completes the uniform. In national tournaments, the Korean national team typically wears white Keikogi with black trim and stripes on their hakama, in contrast to the all indigo-blue worn by Kendo practitioners. By comparison, required dress at training in the classroom may be less formal and idiosyncratic to the values of a given school or teacher. In this way, the more common Martial Arts uniform of, white and/or black pants and jacket, bound with a belt is common. Most recently there has been a growing trend towards recognizing the Korean nature of this art by binding the uniform pants legs at the ankle after the fashion of the Korean Hanbok. Though formerly accomplished with laces, velcro fastening are now used. =Levels/Ranks= Kumdo practitioners begin at the lowest level - 10th geup - and advance in knowledge and skill to 1st geup. The requirements for advancement may differ depending on the school or organizational affiliation, but generally the goal of these levels is to imbue the practitioner with the fundamentals of conditioning, body motion, strategy and competition. After the geup levels, practitioners may continue to progress through a series of advanced ranks termed \\"master\\" or dan beginning with 1st dan level. As with geup levels, students may progress to higher Dan levels by passing required examinations and demonstrating their prowess in competition, both of which are closely observed and assessed by cadre of the school and its organization. = Training = Though training varies from school to school and from organization to organization some general patterns are witnessed across all Kumdo groups. As a Korean practice all interactions between and among students and teachers is closely governed by Neo-Confucian sensitivity to respect and position. In this way students and teachers regularly bow to one another when entering and leaving the school, entering and leaving the workout area, before and after a notable event (IE competition; drill; instruction) and both at the beginning and ending of class. A typical class of about an hour to an hour and a half can be divided into quarters. The first quarter is a warm-up period which focuses on a brief period of stretching and some aerobic activities. The second quarter involves the use of a bamboo sword (K. Juk-To) for drills and striking targets. The third quarter involves donning protective armor and participating in sparring. Alternately, the third portion of the class may be used to practice standardized individual (K. Hyung) or paired (K. Bon) form work. Though not standard, almost all classes conclude with a cool-down activity. Forms practiced by kumdo practitioners include the Bonguk Geombeop (, ), Joseon Saebeop (, ) and the ten bon or kendo no kata (, ), forms standardized by the FIK. The first two forms, the Bonguk Geombeop and Joeson Saebop are unique in that they are practiced by Korean Kendoists and are not practiced by Japanese practitioners. Proficiency with these forms is required for rank promotion tests conducted by the Korea Kumdo Association, the de facto governing body for Korean Kumdo, and its overseas affiliates. The bon practiced in Kumdo may be of two types: a standard set of 10 Kata originating from Kendo and/or a set of 15 engagements originating in Korean swordsmanship (K. Geom Beop). Commonly, either set is performed without sonkyo bow, a unique Japanese gesture, and using Korean names and terminology in place of the original Japanese. Joseon Saebeop and Bonguk Geombeop serve as Kumdo's practical historical link to Korean swordsmanship from previous eras, while bon and overall training and sparring style reflect Japanese influences on modern Kumdo. Recently, A few Kumdo dojang or schools also incorporate kuhapdo forms, the Korean variant for Japanese Iaido - an art focused on simultaneously drawing and cutting - in their curriculum. =Competition= Korea sends a team to the World Kendo Championships or WKC held every three years and have been strong competitors in the past WKCs. During the 13th World Kendo Championships held in Taipei, Taiwan from December 8‚Äì10, 2006, Korea defeated the United States to win the men's team championship for the first time, the first country other than Japan to win a title at the WKCs. The United States had earlier eliminated the Japanese team during the semi-finals. In competition, the main differences between kendo and kumdo are stylistic. Kumdo practitioners generally favor a dynamic style of play, focusing on using fast, aggressive, and effective small motion strikes to create openings for attacks more in line with battlefield use. Kendo practitioners however, general focus on the perfect single strike, waiting patiently for an opening and the correct timing to land a decisive attack. In recent years, with frequent contact between kendo and kumdo stylists through cross-training and competition, this distinction has somewhat blurred, as individual practitioners of either kendo and kumdo have preferred styles of play. Engagements are conducted between two individuals at a time, each wearing body armor and using bamboo swords. The court is typically a square or rectangle 9 to 11 meters on a side - surrounded by an additional margin of 1.5 meters - and is presided over by a referee and two corner referees. During the engagement ‚Äî a five-minute period with the possibility of a three-minute extension ‚Äî competitors may accrue points by striking their opponent with a prescribed attack or thrust. Though infrequently studied in the classroom and sometimes seen in local competitions, the use of disarms followed by a throw or joint-lock is not allowed in international competition. Judgments regarding the nature or quality of an attack, as well as general comportment of the competitors, are signaled by the referees and require a majority agreement to make a determination. With minor stylistic differences (IE.Kumdo judges use blue and white flags instead of the red and white flags found in Kendo) these rules are followed by both Kumdo and Kendo organizations in both national and international play. =Organizations= *The Dae Han Kum Sa Association (ÎåÄÌïúÍ≤ÄÏÇ¨Ìöå), predecessor to the Dae Han Kumdohoe (The Korea Kumdo Association, ÎåÄÌïúÍ≤ÄÎèÑÌöå) was organized on May 20, 1948. At that time, some 100 masters, including SUH Chong Hac, KIM Yong Dal, HO Ik Yong, CHUNG Tae Min, LEE Chung Ku, DO Ho Mun, KANG Nak-won, PAK Chong-kyu and KIM Yong-bae met on the grounds of the Changdok Palace and formed the Taehan Kumsa Association. In 1953, the Korean Kumdo Association was founded by Chong Hac SUH in cooperation with Kendo practitioners both in Korea and Japan. Later, Suh would relocate to Bettendorf, Iowa in the United States and establish the World Kumdo Association from that location. *Korea Kumdo Association (KKA) - the de facto governing organization for kumdo in Korea due to its size and its influence through their heavy promotion of the art in the media. The art promoted by them, Daehan Kumdo (Â§ßÈüìÂäçÈÅì), is virtually identical to kendo as practiced in Japan, with noted changes to reflect Korean cultural influences and methodology, and is the kumdo which Koreans normally refer to. The KKA has established overseas branches in other countries which have substantial Korean populations and have kumdo dojangs or schools. Unlike most of the FIK affiliates, including Japan, they wish to see kumdo/kendo become an Olympic sport as with Judo and Taekwondo. *The World Kumdo Association (WKA) - Founded around 2001 as a merger of thirteen smaller, rival Kumdo organizations, they are critical of the KKA and seek to become a rival to the FIK by having Kumdo included in the Olympic games with them as the recognized governing body ahead of the FIK. Equipment, Forms, regulations and scoring are essentially the same, though Korean practice tends to be somewhat more heavy-handed, while Japanese practice tends to be somewhat lighter. As a result, the WKA are proponents of changes to the format and scoring system, advocating the use of electric scoring as with fencing. There are also a number of Kumdo dojang, or \\"training halls\\" outside Korea, primarily where there are large Korean emigre populations as in North America and Europe. Many of these dojangs choose to be affiliated with overseas branches of Kumdo organizations like the KKA rather than the local FIK affiliate for that country. For example, many of the Kumdo dojangs in the United States choose to affiliate with an overseas branch of the KKA instead of seeking association with the All United States Kendo Federation (AUSKF),auskf.info the FIK affiliate for the US. However, because the KKA is a FIK affiliate, rankings awarded by them, are honored and accepted by the other affiliates including the AUSKF. While Kumdo practitioners outside Korea will also compete in Kendo tournaments, many choose to compete only at tournaments sponsored by a Kumdo organization. One example is the annual Bong- Rim-Gi Kumdo tournament held each summer among Kumdo schools in the United States and sponsored by an overseas branch of the KKA. =Terminology= Kumdo uses Korean language terminology exclusively, though much of it is cognate with the original Kendo terms. For instance, the criteria used to determine whether a point is scored is known as gigeomche (Í∏∞Í≤ÄÏ≤¥; Ê∞£ÂäçÈ´î), instead of ki-ken- tai-iÔΩÉchi (Ê∞óÂâ£‰Ωì‰∏ÄËá¥). This name derives from the same Chinese roots; \\"gi\\" (Ê∞£) for qi or spirit, \\"geom\\" (Âäç) for the sword, and \\"che\\" (È´î) for the body. Below is a table comparing some other similar terms and their corresponding Chinese characters. Note slight differences in the appearance of some characters are due to Japanese use of shinjitai characters. {border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"6\\" cellspacing=\\"1\\" |- ! colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" Terminology |- ! !! kendo (Ââ£ÈÅì)!! kumdo (ÂäçÈÅì) |- ! sword shinai (Á´πÂàÄ) jukdo (Á´πÂàÄ) |- ! armor bogu (Èò≤ÂÖ∑) hogu (Ë≠∑ÂÖ∑) |} See also *Korean swordsmanship *List of Korea-related topics References  External links  * Official website for the World Kumdo Association (WKA) (In English and Korean) Korean martial arts Kendo Swordsmanship ","title":"Kumdo"},{"id":"981460","text":"The Western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, is one of the most devastating corn rootworm species in North America, especially in the midwestern corn-growing areas such as Iowa. A related species, the Northern corn rootworm, D. barberi, co-inhabits in much of the range and is fairly similar in biology. Two other subspecies of D. virgifera are described, including the Mexican corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera zeae), a significant pest in its own right, attacking corn in that country. Corn rootworm larvae can destroy significant percentages of corn if left untreated. In the United States, current estimates show that of corn (out of 80 million grown) are infested with corn rootworm. The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that corn rootworms cause $1 billion in lost revenue each year, including $800 million in yield loss and $200 million in cost of treatment for corn growers.  Life cycle  There are many similarities in the life cycles of the northern and western corn rootworm. Both overwinter in the egg stage in the soil. Eggs, which are deposited in the soil during the summer, are American football-shaped, white, and less than long. Larvae hatch in late May or early June and begin to feed on corn roots. Newly hatched larvae are small, less than long, white worms. Corn rootworms go through three larval instars, pupate in the soil and emerge as adults in July and August. One generation emerges each year. Larvae have brown heads and a brown marking on the top of the last abdominal segment, giving them a double-headed appearance. Larvae have three pairs of legs, but these are not usually visible without magnification. After feeding for several weeks, the larvae dig a cell in the soil and molt into the pupal stage. The pupal stage is white and has the basic shape of the adult. Adult rootworms are about long. Western corn rootworms are yellowish with a black stripe on each wing cover. Northern corn rootworm beetles are solid in color and vary from light tan to pale green. Timing of egg hatch varies from year to year due to temperature differences and location. Males begin to emerge before females. Emergence often continues for a month or more. In years with hot, dry summers, numbers of western corn rootworm beetles may decline rapidly after mid-August, although in summers with less extreme conditions they may be found up until the first frost. Females mate soon after emergence. Western corn rootworm females need to feed for about two weeks before they can lay eggs. Temperature and food quality influence the pre-oviposition period. Females typically lay eggs in the top of soil, although they may be laid more than deep, particularly if the soil surface is dry. Western corn rootworm females are more likely to lay some of their eggs below the depth than northern corn rootworm females.  Feeding habits  Rootworm larvae can complete development only on corn and a few other species of grasses. Rootworm larvae reared on other grasses (specifically, yellow foxtail) emerged as adults later and had smaller head capsule size as adults compared to larvae reared on corn. Adults feed primarily on corn silk, pollen and kernels on exposed ear tips, although they will feed on leaves and pollen of other plants. Adults begin emerging before corn reproductive tissues are present, adults may feed on leaf tissue, scraping away the green surface tissue and leaving a window-pane appearance. However, adults quickly shift to preferred green silks and pollen as they become available. Northern corn rootworm adults feed on reproductive tissues of the corn plant, but rarely feed on corn leaves. \\"Northern\\" adults are more likely than \\"western\\" adults to abandon corn and seek pollen or flowers of other plants as corn matures.  Feeding damage  Most of the damage to corn is caused by larval feeding. Hatchlings locate roots and begin feeding on the fine root hairs, burrowing into root tips. As larvae grow, they feed on and tunnel into primary roots. When rootworms are abundant, larval feeding and deterioration of injured roots by root rot pathogens can result in roots being pruned to the stalk base. Severe root injury interferes with the roots' ability to transport water and nutrients, reduces growth and results in reduced grain production. Severe root injury may result in lodging of corn plants, making harvest more difficult. Silk feeding by adults can result in pruning at the ear tip, commonly called silk clipping. In field corn, beetle populations are occasionally high enough to cause severe silk clipping during pollen shed, which may interfere with pollination.  History of invasions  The Western corn rootworm rapidly expanded its range in North America during the second part of the 20th century. It is now present from the southwestern region of the US Corn Belt to the east coast. It was introduced at the end of the 20th century into Europe, where it was first observed near Belgrade, Serbia in 1992. The Serbian outbreak spread north and south to include Greece to Poland and east from Italy to Ukraine. In addition to this large continuous area in Central and southeastern Europe, discontinuous outbreaks have been detected in Europe. The first was discovered near Venice, Italy, in 1998, in northwestern Italy (Piedmont) and Switzerland (canton Ticino) in 2000, northeastern Italy in 2002 (near Pordenone) and 2003 (near Udine), northern Italy (Trentino), Eastern France (Alsace), Switzerland, Belgium, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in 2003 and the Parisian region, France in 2002, 2004 and 2005. Outbreaks detected in north Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Parisian region did not persist. The distribution of the European corn rootworm resulted from several introductions from North America. At least three successive introductions gave rise to outbreaks detected in Serbia in 1992, the Italian Piedmont in 2000, and Ile-de-France in 2002. The European outbreaks observed in Alsace in 2003 and Ile-de-France in 2005 came from two additional introductions from North America, bringing to five the number of transatlantic introductions. The exact North American origin of the European introductions has not yet been found, but the north of the US appears to be the most likely. Small remote outbreaks in southern Germany and north- eastern Italy most likely originated from long-distance dispersal events from Central and southeastern Europe. The large European outbreak is thus likely expanding by stratified dispersal, involving both continuous diffusion and discontinuous long-distance dispersal. This latter mode of dispersal may accelerate expansion in Europe.  Management  Multiple management practices aim to control corn rootworms. These practices include corn variety selection, early planting, insecticides, crop rotation and transgenic corn varieties. = Variety = No commercial, non-transgenic resistant corn varieties are available. Several hybrid corn traits reduce damage by increasing stalk strength and root mass size. These characteristics allow a plant to better tolerate rootworm feeding, with reduced likelihood of lodging. = Early planting = Early planted fields that have completed pollen shed are less attractive and therefore have less egg laying activity. Early fields have relatively larger root systems when rootworm feeding starts. This makes them somewhat more tolerant. Practices that promote strong root systems and a generally vigorous crop make corn more tolerant to rootworm feeding and damage.Peairs, F. B. and S. D. Pilcher. Western Corn Rootworm Colorado State University. March 24, 2006. Viewed February 3, 2007 = Insecticides = Soil- applied insecticides effectively control corn rootworms. Insecticide may be warranted in areas that have a history of moderate to high damage. The number of adults present during the previous growing season is the best guide for selecting fields to be treated. However, in some areas of high insecticide use in central Nebraska, populations of corn rootworm beetles have become resistant to certain insecticides. Aldrin resistance was probably introduced independently, at least twice, from North America into Europe. Organophosphates, such as methyl-parathion, may provide effective control of both larval and adult populations in Central and southeastern Europe and in northwest Italy. = Crop rotation = Crop rotation is a consistent and economical means of controlling rootworms the season following an outbreak in corn-growing areas where rootworm beetles primarily lay eggs in corn. As a way to reduce rootworm densities, it is more effective than insecticides. Corn rootworm larvae must feed on corn roots to develop and mature properly. If they hatch in a field without corn, they starve because they cannot move more than 10 to in search of food. However, two rootworm biotypes survive rotation. The \\"soybean\\" variant was first discovered in central Illinois in the late 1980s and spread throughout Illinois, Indiana, southern Wisconsin and eastern Iowa.Rice, M. E. and J. J. Tollefson. The variant western corn rootworm in Iowa. Iowa State University. March 13, 2006. Viewed February 3, 2007. Instead of laying eggs into a corn field, the females of the soybean variant mate and then fly into a soybean field to lay their eggs, allowing the larvae to hatch in a field likely to rotate back to corn the following year. In the 1980s northern corn rootworm began to be a problem by beating the corn rotation practice with extended diapause eggs.Willson H. R. and J. B. Eisley. Monitoring Western Corn Rootworm Activity in Soybeans to Predict Rootworm Injury in First-Year Corn. August 2001. Viewed February 3, 2007. The eggs remained in the soil for two years or more before hatching, thereby avoiding the soybean year. As of 2017, this adaptation has been observed in areas of Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota, Wisconsin and Nebraska. Companion or second crop planting can dramatically increase rootworm populations. Corn with pumpkins or corn following pumpkins are examples of planting patterns that exacerbate rootworm feeding pressure. Shrestha, Dunbar, French & Gassmann tell us that field history causes variation in the degree of corn rootworm resistance. All the fields they found had corn rootworms resistant to the traits, but they observed that significantly more corn rootworm larvae survived in fields with Bt resistance. They recommend faithful crop rotation not only for reducing the population of the worm, but to slow the adaptation of the worm as well. = Natural enemies = Among natural enemies - Argiope bruennichi, Theridion impressum, Coccinella sp., Pseudophomus rufipes. = Transgenics = Planting rootworm-resistant transgenic corn, is another strategy for minimizing damage. BT corn is effective at reducing root damage and is safer and often cheaper than insecticide. The transgenic traits, isolated from the common soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis strain (often referred to as Bt), produce the insect control protein. Bt was first discovered in 1901 by Japanese biologist S. Ishiwatari as the source of disease that was killing large populations of silkworms. Bt was first used as an insecticide in 1920 and spray formulations containing either Bt bacteria or Bt proteins came into use in the 1970s for crop protection, including organic farming operations. Bt insecticides saw expanded use and development in the 1980s as an alternative to synthetic insecticides. Beginning in the 1980s, the genes responsible for making Bt proteins were isolated and transferred into corn plants. Bt was commercially approved in transgenic corn seed in the mid-1990s. Compared to spray formulations, transgenic plants with the Bt protein provide much more effective insect protection throughout the season. Other Bt proteins have been used to genetically modify potatoes, cotton and other types of commercial corn. The two most common brands of transgenic Bt corn are Genuity and Herculex. Genuity Smartstax combines Monsanto's VT Triple Pro, Roundup Ready 2, and Acceleron Seed Treatment System technologies, as well as Dow Chemical's Herculex Xtra and Liberty Link technologies. Acceleron, Herculex Xtra, and VT Triple Pro include traits for protection from insect damage. Bt must be ingested to kill the insect. A susceptible larva eats the protein, which then binds to receptors in the larval gut. Binding initiates a cascade of effects that ultimately leads to death. Bt proteins are highly selective on certain categories and species of insects, eliminating insecticide use and its harmful effects to non-target organisms.The Dow Chemical Company. Product Safety Assessment (PSA): Herculex RW Rootworm Protection. September 26, 2006. Viewed February 3, 2007. Recently, however, strains of rootworms have been discovered in several Midwest US states that exhibit Bt resistance. According to Monsanto, the ‚ÄúYieldGard¬Æ VT Triple and Genuity¬Æ VT Triple PRO‚Ñ¢ corn products‚Äù are affected. In 2009, four strains in Iowa were found to have field-evolved resistance to Bt corn. Some rootworms were found to be resistant to two or more Bt toxins in addition to being tolerant to crop rotation. This ability to rapidly evolve to adapt to multiple traits in their new food source has proved to be a big challenge for farmers and scientists. That same year, Monsanto, DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta and Dow Agro-Sciences all began to sell ‚Äústacked‚Äù or pyramid corn seed designed to slow the development of resistance. These products combined traits to increase effectiveness, however, so many of these traits are failing that soon they will run out of ingredients to stack. A new bacterial gene had been discovered by researchers that will kill rootworms, but it is not expected to be available to farmers before 2029. By 2014 Syngenta Agrisure RW-rootworm strains had been detected in Iowa as well as glyphosate. Agrisure RW-based products entered the market in 2007. However, government officials, academics and companies lack consensus on how to define the resistance phenomenon. The affected fields constituted 0.2% of transgenic US corn acres. Further the affected areas had not been rotated with other crops. As of December 2018, the corn rootworm has been found to be resistant to all four traits. = Biological solutions = In Austria, an innovative protection method has been developed, using the \\"mating disruption\\" method for the first time ever in fields. The according product is called CornProtect. The female bugs distribute pheromones that attract males. With that new method, such pheromones are put on specially treated mineral carriers and are slowly released over the full flying period of the bugs. Mating is significantly reduced, because males become disoriented and less interested in copulating. Reproduction is drastically reduced The application is done with conventional field sprayers which makes it economically very viable.

It is believed to have been founded about 800 CE, some 650 years earlier than Machu Picchu. This location is also known as \\"Teyuna\\" and \\"Buritaca 200\\". Ciudad Perdida consists of a series of 169 terraces carved into the mountainside, a net of tiled roads and several small circular plazas. The entrance can only be accessed by a climb up some 1,200 stone steps through dense jungle. Modern discovery Ciudad Perdida was discovered in 1972, when a group of local treasure looters found a series of stone steps rising up the mountainside and followed them to an abandoned city which they named \\"Green Hell\\" or \\"Wide Set\\". When gold figurines and ceramic urns from this city began to appear in the local black market, archaeologists headed by the director of the Instituto Colombiano de Antropolog√≠a reached the site in 1976 and completed reconstruction between 1976‚Äì1982. Members of local tribes ‚Äì the Arhuaco, the Koguis, and the Wiwas ‚Äì have stated that they visited the site regularly before it was widely reported, but had kept quiet about it. They call the city Teyuna and believe it was the heart of a network of villages inhabited by their forebears, the Tairona. Ciudad Perdida was probably the region's political and manufacturing center on the Buritaca River and may have housed 2,000‚Äì8,000 people. It was apparently abandoned during the Spanish conquest. Armed conflict The area is now completely safe but was at one time affected by the Colombian armed conflict between the Colombian National Army, right-wing paramilitary groups and left-wing guerrilla groups like National Liberation Army (ELN) and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). On 15 September 2003, ELN kidnapped eight foreign tourists visiting Ciudad Perdida, demanding a government investigation into human rights abuses in exchange for their hostages. ELN released the last of the hostages three months later. The United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), the paramilitary right-wing groups in that country, continued attacking aborigines and non-aborigines in the zone for a while. For some time the zone has been free of incidents. Resumed access In 2005, tourist hikes became operational again and there have been no problems since then. The Colombian army actively patrols the area, which is now deemed to be safe for visitors, and there have not been any more kidnappings. Since 2009, non-profit organization Global Heritage Fund (GHF) has been working in Ciudad Perdida to preserve and protect the historic site against climate, vegetation, neglect, looting, and unsustainable tourism. GHF's stated goals include the development and implementation of a regional Management Plan, documentation and conservation of the archaeological features at Ciudad Perdida and the engagement of the local indigenous communities as major stakeholders in the preservation and sustainable development of the site. For a 4 day hike to the lost city, the cost is approximately US$334, a fixed-price arranged by the communities that inhabit the surroundings of the trail. It is a moderately difficult hike: The hike is about 42 km of walking in total, and requires a good level of fitness. The hike includes a number of river crossings and steep climbs and descents.

Early years Col√≥n was born in Cayey, Puerto Rico after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War when the American Tobacco Company gained control of most of the tobacco producing land in Puerto Rico. His father was a baker and his family owned the \\"Colon Hotel\\". His home was behind the town's cigar factory, which hired \\"readers\\" to read stories and current events to the employees whilst they worked. As a child, Col√≥n visited the factory to listen to these stories. He was exposed to the writings of Karl Marx and √âmile Zola. From these ideas he formed a personal socialist ideology and also an interest in both the spoken and written word. The family moved to San Juan where he attended and continued his education at the Jos√© Juli√°n Acosta School. His brother Joaquin attended the Central High School.Biography of Jesus Colon New York City SS Carolina In 1917, when he was 16 he boarded the SS Carolina as an employee and landed in Brooklyn, New York. There he went to live with his older brother, Joaquin Colon, who was already residing in Brooklyn.

He wrote about his experiences, as well as the experiences of other immigrants, becoming among the first Puerto Ricans to do so in English. His best known work, A Puerto Rican in New York, set the stage for the literary movement known as the \\"Nuyorican Movement\\". Col√≥n inspired other writers such as Piri Thomas, Esmeralda Santiago, Nicholasa Mohr, Pedro Pietri, and others.Father of Nuyorican movement Col√≥n began a Spanish language newspaper. In 1927, Col√≥n joined the editorial board of the New York City-based newspaper Gr√°fico (a newspaper edited by Bernardo Vega that featured writing by Cuban, Puerto Rican and other Latina/o migrants living in New York City).L√≥pez, Antonio M. Unbecoming Blackness: The Diaspora Cultures of Afro-Cuban America. NYU Press, 2012, 33 In 1955, he wrote a regular column for the Daily Worker, a publication of the Communist Party in New York. Col√≥n was also the president of \\"Hispanic Publications\\" which published history books, political pamphlets in Spanish, and literature. In the 1940s, Col√≥n was president of the Cervantes Fraternal Society, the Spanish language division of the pro-Communist International Workers Order (IWO), a non-profit fraternal organization (life & health insurance, social and cultural activities, etc.) made up of 16 ethnic/language groupings that, in total at its height, counted almost 200,000 members. (The Cervantes Fraternal Society, IWO, should not be confused with the Cervantes Society of America, an academic group.) The IWO, after being included on the U. S. Attorney General's list of \\"subversive organizations\\" (the listing was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court), was dissolved by the NY State Supreme Court in 1951.Sabin, Arthur J.

His astronomical celestial globe featured a clockwork escapement mechanism, the first in a long tradition of Chinese astronomical clockworks. Science and technology =Terrestrial- astronomical survey= In the early 8th century, the Tang court put Yi Xing in charge of a terrestrial-astronomical survey.Hsu, 98. This survey had many purposes. It was established in order to obtain new astronomical data that would aid in the prediction of solar eclipses. The survey was also initiated so that flaws in the calendar system could be corrected and a new, updated calendar installed in its place. The survey was also essential in determining the measurement of the length of meridian arc-although Yi Xing, who did not know the Earth was spherical, did not conceptualize his measurements in these terms. This would resolve the confusion created by the earlier practice of using the difference between shadow lengths of the sun observed at the same time at two places to determine the ground distance between them. Yi Xing had thirteen test sites established throughout the empire, extending from Jiaozhou in Vietnam ‚Äî at latitude 17¬∞N ‚Äî to the region immediately south of Lake Baikal ‚Äî latitude 50¬∞N.Hsu, 99. There were three observations done for each site, one for the height of polaris, one for the shadow lengths of summer, and one for the shadow lengths of winter. The latitudes were deciphered from this data, while the Tang calculation for the length of one degree of meridian was fairly accurate compared to modern calculations. Yi Xing understood the variations in the length of a degree of meridian, and criticized earlier scholars who permanently fixed an estimate for shadow lengths for the duration of the entire year. =The escapement and celestial globe= Yi Xing was famed for his genius, known to have calculated the number of possible positions on a go board game (though without a symbol for zero as he had difficulties expressing the number). He, along with his associate, the mechanical engineer and politician Liang Lingzan, is best known for applying the earliest-known escapement mechanism to a water-powered celestial globe. However, Yi Xing's mechanical genius and achievements were built upon the knowledge and efforts of previous Chinese mechanical engineers, such as the statesman and master of gear systems Zhang Heng (78‚Äì139) of the Han Dynasty, the mechanical engineer Ma Jun (200‚Äì265) of the Three Kingdoms, and the Daoist Li Lan (c. 450) of the Southern and Northern Dynasties period. It was the earlier Chinese inventor Zhang Heng during the Han dynasty who was the first to apply hydraulic power (i.e. a waterwheel and water clock) in mechanically-driving and rotating his equatorial armillary sphere. The arrangement followed the model of a water- wheel using the drip of a clepsydra (see water clock), which ultimately exerted force on a lug to rotate toothed-gears on a polar-axis shaft.Needham, Volume 4, 532. With this, the slow computational movement rotated the armillary sphere according to the recorded movements of the planets and stars. Yi Xing also owed much to the scholarly followers of Ma Jun, who had employed horizontal jack-wheels and other mechanical toys worked by waterwheels. The Daoist Li Lan was an expert at working with water clocks, creating steelyard balances for weighing water that was used in the tank of the clepsydra, providing more inspiration for Yi Xing. Like the earlier water-power employed by Zhang Heng and the later escapement mechanism in the astronomical clock tower engineered and erected by Su Song (1020‚Äì1101), Yi Xing's celestial globe employed water-power in order for it to rotate and function properly.Needham, Volume 4, 470. The British biochemist, historian, and sinologist Joseph Needham states (Wade‚ÄìGiles spelling): In regards to mercury instead of water (as noted in the quote above), the first to apply liquid mercury for motive power of an armillary sphere was Zhang Sixun in 979 AD (because mercury would not freeze during winter).Needham, Volume 3, 350.Needham, Volume 4, 471. During his age, the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) era historical text of the Song Shi mentions Yi Xing and the reason why his armillary sphere did not survive the ages after the Tang (Wade‚ÄìGiles spelling): Earlier Tang era historical texts of the 9th century have this to say of Yi Xing's work in astronomical instruments in the 8th century (Wade‚ÄìGiles spelling): Buddhist scholarship Yi Xing wrote a commentary on the Mahavairocana Tantra. This work had a strong influence on the Japanese monk K≈´kai and was key in his establishment of Shingon Buddhism.Rethinking Japan p.330 In his honor Memorial Pagoda of Monk Yi Xing At the Tiantai-Buddhist Guoqing Temple of Mount Tiantai in Zhejiang Province, there is a Chinese pagoda erected directly outside the temple known as the Memorial Pagoda of Monk Yi Xing. His tomb is also located on Mount Tiantai.

The name derives from the Latin tunica, the basic garment worn by both men and women in Ancient Rome, which in turn was based on earlier Greek garments that covered wearers' waists. Ancient era 20th-century Yemen - Jewish Men dressed in tunics = Indian tunic = Indus valley civilization figurines depict both women and men wearing a tunic-like garment. A terracotta model called Lady of the spiked throne depicts two standing turban-wearing men wearing what appears to be a conical gown marked by a dense series of thin vertical incisions that might suggest stiffened cloth. A similar gold disc in the al-Sabah Collection from the Kuwait National Museum appears to be from the Indus Valley civilization depicts similar conical tunic-wearing men holding two bulls by their tails under a pipal tree shown in an Indus-like mirror symmetry. A mother goddess figurine from the National Museum new Dehli shows a female wearing a short tight tunic. Worn in the Indian Sub-Continent, including India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the tunic is usually referred to as Kurta and is now an emerging women's top style increasingly liked by many in the West. An Asian tunic is typically adorned with delicate embroidery, bead- work or intricate threadwork as well. Embroidery or thread work on such tunics usually combines threads of many different colors. =Celtic tunic= Tunics worn by the Celts were documented by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus: \\"... the way they dress is astonishing: they wear brightly coloured and embroidered shirts, with trousers called braccae and cloaks fastened at the shoulder with a brooch, heavy in winter, light in summer. These cloaks are striped or checkered in design, with the separate checks close together and in various colours.\\" =Greek tunic= Tunics were also worn in ancient Greece, whence the Roman version was adopted. Later Greek and Roman tunics were an evolution from the very similar chiton, chitoniskos, and exomis all of which can be considered versions of the garment. In ancient Greece, a person's tunic was decorated at the hem-line to represent the city-state in which he lived. Tunics might be dyed with bright colours, like red, purple, or green. There was also the Sisura (Œ£ŒπœÉœçœÅŒ±), according to Pollux was a tunic with sleeves of skins.A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, PELLIS According to Suda, it was a type of inexpensive cloak, like a one-shoulder tunic.Suda, si.487 In the A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities it mention that it seems, that it was more of a cloak than a tunic, and was worn for warmth or used to sleep in. Adding that in late authors the term may possibly mean a piece of cloth. =Roman tunic= The Roman tunica was adopted by the Roman citizens in the 3rd century BC. It was often worn by citizens and non-citizens alike; citizens, though, might wear it under the toga, especially at formal occasions. The length of the garment, the presence or lack of stripes, as well as their width and ornamentation, would indicate the wearer's status in Roman society. Roman senators, for example, used the Laticlavus, with broad purple stripes, and members of the equestrian class wore the Angusticlavia, with narrower stripes. Soldiers, slaves and manual workers generally had tunics to a little above the knee; those in more sedentary occupations to about the ankle (unless they were expecting to ride a horse, when a shorter one would be worn). Roman worker dressed in a tunic The tunic or chiton was worn as a shirt or gown by both genders among the ancient Romans. The body garment was loose- fitting for males, usually beginning at the neck and ending above the knee. A woman's garment could be either close fitting or loose, beginning at the neck and extending over a skirt or skirts. =Germanic tunic= The various Celtic and Germanic peoples living in the colder Middle and Northern Europe wore long-sleeved tunics from as long back as pictorial evidence goes. Such tunics are often found depicted on the various Roman monuments depicting victories over these peoples, and show the tunic as a simple pull-over construction reaching to the mid-thighs or to the knees. Similar tunics were eventually taken up by the Romans, and continued to be used into the Byzantine period. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the long sleeved Celto-Germanic tunic continued to be worn. The construction was more elaborate than the earlier Graeco-Roman garment, with a tight-fitting neck with a split down the front for pulling it over the head, and gusset under the arms and inserted around the lower half to give a flaring skirt. Being used by both Vikings and Normans, the garment continued as a general male garment into the Middle Ages, still being used in Norway as late as the 17th century. Medieval tunic The tunic continued to be the basic garment of the Byzantine Romans of both sexes throughout the medieval period. The upper classes wore other garments atop the basic tunic, such as the dalmatica, a heavier and shorter type of tunic, again, worn by both sexes, or the scaramangion, a riding-coat of Persian origin. Except for the military or riding-dress, men and women of higher status wore tunics that came down to the ankles, or nearly so. Tunics were often dyed or richly embroidered, although the plainer ones could be used when layering different types. Beyond the reduced empire, the tunic continued to be worn with varying sleeve and hem lengths throughout Europe during the Middle Ages. Often reaching the knees or ankles, it was usually worn over underclothes consisting of a shirt (usually hip-length or longer) and drawers (usually knee- or ankle-length pants related to braccae). It may be accompanied by hose.\\"Dress and Adornment\\", 488‚Äì489. Wool and linen were common fabrics used, though the wealthy sometimes wore fancy silk tunics, or a lesser fabric with silk trim.Germanic tunic of the 4th Century, A.D. found at the Thorsberg moor Tunics worn during the Early Middle Ages often featured decorative embroidery or tablet-woven braids along the neck, hem and wrists.\\"Dress and Adornment\\", 489.Owen-Crocker, Gale R., Dress in Anglo-Saxon England, revised edition, Boydell Press, 2004, This was the case, for instance, with tunics worn by both rich and poor Anglo-Saxons before the Norman Conquest.Bradfield, Nancy. Historical Costumes of England: 1066‚Äì1968. 3rd Edition. 1970. p. 13 Tunic, ca. 17th century, made in Peru, Brooklyn Museum Modern tunic Around 1830, small boys began to be dressed in sashed or belted tunics over trousers, a fashion which replaced the earlier skeleton suit. During the Crimean War in the 1850s, it was realized that the waist length jackets which had been worn by British soldiers since Napoleonic times were unsuitable for fighting in winter conditions. A new longer jacket was introduced which reached down to the mid thigh and this was named the 'tunic' after the 'tunica' of the intrepid ancient Roman soldier. This type of jacket soon became standard for most armies.Nicholson, J, 'The British Army of the Crimea', Osprey 1974 In Western culture, its use continues primarily in a religious and uniform context. It is the primary garment worn by the clergy and members of religious orders. The religious tunic reaches to the feet and was the source of the clerical cassock, as well as, in its liturgical form, the alb, after the long tunic worn by Roman citizens.Pocknee, C.E. 'Liturgical Vesture: Its Origins and Development' 1960 'Tunic' is also the name often given to the high-collar uniform coat worn by military and police personnel. Light feminine garments, especially for sports or exercise, usually only coming down to mid-thigh, are also called tunics.

It is one of the oldest markets in London, dating from the 14th century, and is located in the historic centre of the City of London financial district. History The market dates from the 14th century and is said to derive its name from Leather-hall, though it is disputable. The early history of Leaden Hall involves the Mayor (1446), Simon Eyre. According to John Stow. ‚ÄúEyre, a draper built Leaden Hall for a common garner of corn for the use of this city‚Äù. Stow Survey of London. The Market is typically open weekdays from 10 am until 6 pm, and primarily sells fresh food; among the vendors there are cheesemongers, butchers and florists. Originally a meat, game and poultry market, it stands on what was the centre of Roman London.Leadenhall Market (City of London) accessed 30 September 2009 A number of commercial retailers are also located in the market, including clothes shops. The ornate roof structure, painted green, maroon and cream, and cobbled floors of the current structure, designed in 1881 by Sir Horace Jones (who was also the architect of Billingsgate and Smithfield Markets), make Leadenhall Market a tourist attraction. The main entrance to the market is on Gracechurch Street. The double height entrance is flanked by tall, narrow gabled red brick and Portland stone blocks in a 17th- century Dutch style. The adjacent buildings to the south have a continuous retail frontage which is punctuated by narrow entrances to pedestrian ways into the market. Between 1990 and 1991 the market received a dramatic redecoration which transformed its appearance, enhancing its architectural character and detail. The redecoration scheme received a special mention in the Civic Trust Awards in 1994. The market is a Grade II* listed building, being listed in 1972. It was used to represent the area of London near the Leaky Cauldron and Diagon Alley in the film Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) and is featured in the films The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, Hereafter, Brannigan, and Love Aaj Kal. It was also used in the music video for the 1991 Erasure song \\"Love to Hate You\\".

Biography Born into a family of musicians, he is a former student of √âmile Passani and Olivier Messiaen and has also received a diploma in Greek archaeology (1957) and a teaching certificate (Agr√©gation de Lettres classiques, 1958). He was a member of the Groupe de Recherches Musicales in Paris from 1958‚Äì63. He has composed electroacoustic, orchestral, chamber, choral, vocal and piano works. He has been a member of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts since 2002 and occupies the chair of the late Iannis Xenakis.\\"M√¢che, Fran√ßois-Bernard\\", Living Composers Project. M√¢che's Music, Myth and Nature, or The Dolphins of Arion (Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion) (1983, 1992 ), which as a whole argues for a return in composition to mythic thought, includes a study of \\"ornitho-musicology\\" using a technique of Nicolas Ruwet's Langage, musique, po√©sie (1972) paradigmatic segmentation analysis, shows that birdsongs are organized according to a repetition-transformation principle. One purpose of the book was to ‚Äúbegin to speak of animal musics other than with the quotation marks‚Äù,M√¢che (1992). Music, Myth and Nature, or The Dolphins of Arion, p.114. . and he is credited by Dario Martinelli with the creation of zoomusicology. The book also describes the conception and composition of pieces by M√¢che, where, \\"As a starting point, he borrows a tonal model from reality which he then submits to a highly intricate process leading to abstraction.\\" This technique leads Daniel Durney to describe M√¢che as \\"one of the rare exponents of the naturalistic trend in music.\\" Models often include human speech and bird song. Given the extensive use of birdsong made by Messiaen, M√¢che avoided using birdsong recordings in his own work until 1969: Naluan for ensemble and tape from 1974, \\"systematically explores\\" the model of birds;M√¢che (1992), p.189. while Sopiana of 1980 pits recordings of Malayan shamas, icterine warblers and marsh warblers against the virtuosity of a live flute and piano. Recordings of birdsong, insect sounds, and other natural phenomena such as raindrops are integrated into Le printemps du serpent for large percussion ensemble of 2001. Earlier in M√¢che's composing career, recording of a poem by the modern Greek poet Giorgos Seferis, read by M√¢che himself, formed the basis of the orchestral work La peau du silence (1962), and that of a text by Paul √âluard for Le son d'une voix for small orchestra in 1964. Other major works include Kassandra for large ensemble and tape, which won the Italia Prize in 1977; Eridan (1986) and Moires (1994), both written for the Arditti Quartet; Kengir (1991), settings of ancient Sumerian love poems, and Manuel de r√©surrection (1998), setting texts from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, both written for the soprano Fran√ßoise Kubler and Ensemble \\"Accroche Note\\".

There has been a market on the site for over 350 years. In 1991 it gave its name to New Spitalfields Market in Leyton, where fruit and vegetables are now traded. In 2005, a regeneration programme resulted in the new public spaces: Bishops Square and Crispin Place, which are now part of the modern Spitalfields Market. A range of public markets runs daily, with independent local stores and restaurants - as well as new office developments. It is situated in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, just outside the City of London. The closest London Underground and mainline railway station is Liverpool Street. Historic market South-east corner of the Horner Buildings, constructed 1887 There has been a market on the site since 1638 when King Charles I gave a licence for flesh, fowl and roots to be sold on Spittle Fields, which was then a rural area on the eastern outskirts of London.Spitalfields Market Published 2008. Retrieved 17 June 2009. After the rights to a market had seemingly lapsed during the time of the Commonwealth, the market was re-founded in 1682 by King Charles II in order to feed the burgeoning population of a new suburb of London. Market buildings were sited on the rectangular patch of open ground which retained the name Spittle Fields: demarcated by Crispin Street to the west, Lamb Street to the north, Red Lion Street (later subsumed into Commercial Street) to the east and Paternoster Row (later known as Brushfield Street) to the south.Spitalfields (Part 2) From \\"The Copartnership Herald\\", Vol. I, no. 11 (Christmas 1931-January 1932) Fiona Rule (2008) The Worst Street in London. Hersham, Ian Allan: 25 The existing buildings were constructed between 1885 and 1893 to the designs of George Sherrin. They were commissioned by Robert Horner, the last private owner of the market, and remain known as the Horner Buildings. The market was acquired by the City of London Corporation in 1920, to serve as a wholesale market. It was extended westward to Steward Street in 1926, destroying the northern extensions of Crispin Street and Gun Street in the process.Fiona Rule (2008) The Worst Street in London. Hersham, Ian Allan: 201 In 1991 the wholesale fruit and vegetable market moved to New Spitalfields Market, Leyton, and the original site became known as Spitalfields Market. The market stalls were redesigned by architects Foster and Partners for Old Spitalfields Market in October 2017. Modern market Old Spitalfields Market 2018 Being at the centre of a revival in the area, the eastern end of Spitalfields retained its old charm in Horner Square and Horner Buildings, which are Grade II listed buildings. The Victorian buildings and the market hall and roof have been restored and Spitalfields is now one of London's major markets. The market square is a popular fashion, arts and crafts, food and general market, open seven days a week, but is particularly busy at weekends. In the late 20th century, there was a dispute between the owners, the City of London Corporation and local residents about the redevelopment of the 1926 market extension at the western end. The Corporation won, and now a Norman Foster-designed office block surrounds the western side of the site, after two-thirds of the historic market were rebuilt to include restaurants, shops and a large indoor arts and crafts market, called the Traders' Market. The Gun, a pub situated to the south of the market buildings, recalls Tudor times, when the Old Artillery Ground in this area was used by the Honourable Artillery Company to practice with cross-bow, and later guns and artillery pieces. At the east end, and on the other side of Commercial Street, is Christ Church, a large Nicholas Hawksmoor church. In January 2011 Spitalfields received the \\"Best Private Market\\" award by the National Association of British Market Authorities. Old Spitalfields Market currently hosts a vintage market each Thursday, a vinyl fair some Fridays and a general arts and craft market throughout the week continuing through to the weekend.

Crustal fragments of this former microcontinent underlie south- west Great Britain, southern Ireland, and the eastern coast of North America. It is the source of many of the older rocks of Western Europe, Atlantic Canada, and parts of the coastal United States. Avalonia is named for the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland. Avalonia developed as a volcanic arc on the northern margin of Gondwana. It eventually rifted off, becoming a drifting microcontinent. The Rheic Ocean formed behind it, and the Iapetus Ocean shrank in front. It collided with the continents Baltica, then Laurentia, and finally with Gondwana, ending up in the interior of Pangea. When Pangea broke up, Avalonia's remains were divided by the rift which became the Atlantic Ocean.  Development  Schematic diagram of the paleogeographic evolution of Avalonia, Baltica and Laurentia. (Names in German.) Location of the Caledonian/Acadian mountain chains in the Early Devonian Epoch. Present day coastlines are shown for reference. Red lines are sutures, capitalized names are the different continents/super-terranes that joined during the Caledonian orogeny. The Old Red Sandstone Continent in the Devonian The early development of Avalonia is believed to have been in volcanic arcs near a subduction zone on the margin of Gondwana. Some material may have accreted from volcanic island arcs which formed further out in the ocean and later collided with Gondwana as a result of plate tectonic movements. The igneous activity had started by 730 million years ago and continued until around 570 million years ago, in the late Neoproterozoic. In the early Cambrian, the supercontinent Pannotia broke up and Avalonia drifted off northwards from Gondwana. This independent movement of Avalonia started from a latitude of about 60¬∞ South. The eastern end of Avalonia collided with Baltica, a continental plate occupying the latitudes from about 30¬∞S to 55¬∞S, as Baltica slowly rotated counterclockwise towards it. This happened at the end of the Ordovician and during the Early Silurian. In the late Silurian and lower Devonian, the combined Baltica and Avalonia collided progressively, with Laurentia, beginning with the long extremity of Avalonia which is now attached to North America. The result of this was the formation of Euramerica. At the completion of this stage, the site of Britain was at 30¬∞S and Nova Scotia at about 45¬∞S. This collision is represented by the Caledonian folding or in North America as an early phase in the Acadian orogeny. In the Carboniferous, the new continent and another terrane, Armorica which included Iberia, drifted in from Gondwana, trapping Avalonia between it and the continent so adding Iberia/Armorica to Euramerica. This was followed up by the arrival of Gondwana. The effects of these collisions are seen in Europe as the Variscan folding. In North America it shows as later phases of the Acadian orogeny. This was happening at around the Equator during the later Carboniferous, forming Pangaea with Avalonia near its centre but partially flooded by shallow sea. In the Jurassic, Pangaea split into Laurasia and Gondwana, with Avalonia as part of Laurasia. In the Cretaceous, Laurasia broke up into North America and Eurasia with Avalonia split between them. Iberia was later rotated away again as the African part of Gondwana strike-slipped past it. This last movement caused the Alpine orogeny including the raising of the Pyrenees during the Miocene and Pliocene. As a result of this, part of Avalonia is now to be found on each side of the Straits of Gibraltar.  Consequences  This map shows the positions of the rocks of Avalonia remaining in Europe. The notes on it indicate the part which collided with Baltica in the upper Ordovician and that which collided with Laurentia in the Silurian. The parts of Avalonia now in Iberia and Morocco were carried there by rotation of Iberia during the subsequent collision with Gondwana followed by separation. These rocks are by no means all at the modern surface. The Avalonian part of Great Britain almost exactly coincides with England and Wales. Elsewhere in Europe, parts of Avalonia are found in the Ardennes of Belgium and north-eastern France, north Germany, north-western Poland, south-eastern Ireland, and the south-western edge of the Iberian Peninsula. Part of the British-Belgian section formed an island in the Carboniferous, affecting the disposition of coalfields; this is known by names such as the 'London-Brabant Island'. Its bulk had an effect on the geological structure between the Ardennes and the English Midlands by influencing the subsequent crustal folding resulting from the Variscan collision. In Canada, Avalonia comprises the Avalon Peninsula of southeast Newfoundland, southern New Brunswick, part of Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. In the United States, Avalonia consists of northern coastal Maine, all of Rhode Island, and other sections of coastal New England.

He also took art lessons at night school. After working on the Glasgow telephone system for a while, he established a commercial art studio in London, where, as a side-line, he branched out into designing and making model aircraft for sale, in due course expanding to the manufacture of full size gliders. Twining Models His model-making work brought him into contact with Bassett-Lowke, the Northampton model making firm, for whom he did sub-contract work. In 1920 he founded Twining Models at Northampton, which manufactured glass-case models of industrial, architectural, advertising and transport themes. Other interests Twining was polymathic in his interests, and was active in the worlds of model railways, art and design, aeronautics, astronomy and photography, ships and ship models, and stained glass. In Northampton, his windows can be found at Holy Trinity Church Hall, St Edmunds, Hardingstone, St Francis de Sales, Wolverton and the Northampton Museum. Writing Twining was also a prolific author, writing for numerous hobby magazines, and wrote several books, the most notable being: * The Art and Craft of Stained Glass (1928), long regarded as the best textbook available. * Art in Advertising (1931) (with Dorothy E.

From 1795 to 1821 it was paired with the North West Company's Fort Augustus. It was the end point of the Carlton Trail, the main overland route for Metis freighters between the Red River Colony and the west and an important stop on the York Factory Express route between London, via Hudson Bay, and Fort Vancouver in the Columbia District. The fifth and final Fort Edmonton was the one that evolved into present-day Edmonton. Fort Edmonton was also called Fort-des-Prairies, by French-Canadians trappers and coureurs des bois, and Amiskwaskahegan or \\"Beaver Hills House\\" by the Cree, the most populous Indigenous peoples in the region during the 19th century.Fort-des-PrairiesNaming Edmonton: from Ada to Zoie, (ed.) Merrily K. Aubrey, University of Alberta Press, Edmonton (Alta.), 2004, Edmonton Historical Board, Heritage Sites Committee. p. 18 First Fort Edmonton (1794‚Äì1802) Coordinates: In the late 18th century, the Hudson's Bay Company was in fierce competition with the North West Company for the trade of animal furs in Rupert's Land. As one company established a fur trading post, the other would counter by building another post in close proximity. Expansion up the Saskatchewan River began in the 1790s. In the summer of 1795, the North West Company constructed Fort Augustus where the Sturgeon River meets the North Saskatchewan River, just north of the present-day city of Fort Saskatchewan, approximately northeast of the final Fort Edmonton (near the present-day Alberta Legislature Building in Edmonton). In the following autumn, Hudson's Bay constructed Edmonton House closeby, taking advantage of the same two rivers; in a possible revelation of the competitive nature of the companies, Fort Augustus and Edmonton House's distance was described as being a \\"musket-shot\\" apart,Fort Edmonton yet the proximity also offered mutual security to the European traders of both companies in a land where they were all intruders. Edmonton House, and the subsequent forts, was named by John Peter Pruden, clerk to the HBC's George Sutherland. The Fort was named after Edmonton, Middlesex, England, birthplace of both Pruden and HBC Deputy Governor Sir James Winter Lake.Frederick William Howay: Builders of the West (Ryerson, 1929) Second Fort Edmonton (1802-1810) Coordinates: In 1802, due to several years of declining fur returns and increasingly scarce firewood, it was decided to move Fort Edmonton and Fort Augustus upstream, to what is now the Rossdale area of downtown Edmonton. This area had been a gathering place for aboriginals in the region for thousands of years. The first woman of European descent to live in this region was the French-Canadian Marie-Anne Lagimodi√®re (n√©e Gaboury), who was also noteworthy as the grandmother of Louis Riel. She had accompanied her fur trader husband, Jean- Baptiste Lagimodi√®re, into the west shortly after their marriage in Trois- Rivi√®res, Qu√©bec, and was known to take part in hunting expeditions. The couple lived in Fort Augustus from 1807 to 1811. John Rowand, the Chief Factor at Fort Edmonton from 1823 to 1854, first worked at Fort Augustus from 1804 to 1806; he was stationed there again from 1808 onward.INDIAN TERRITORIES (ALBERTA) 1800‚Äì1829 Evidence of this Fort Edmonton was found in 2012, when crews were excavating under a demolished machine shop at the Rossdale Power Plant. Third Fort Edmonton (1810‚Äì1812)  Coordinates: Both Fort Augustus and Fort Edmonton moved to the mouth of White Earth Creek, 100 km northeast of modern Edmonton at the northernmost point of the North Saskatchewan near present-day Smoky Lake, Alberta. The place is also known as Fort White Earth, or Terre Blanche. This location was only active for two years for two main reasons: the Cree had been encouraged to visit other posts to avoid violent confrontations with the Blackfoot, yet the generally more southerly Blackfoot refused to travel so far off of their normal circles and consequently took their trade south to Americans. While the Hudson's Bay Company and North West Company still operated separate posts, in direct competition with each other, the two posts were built inside a shared palisade. After its abandonment in 1812, the forts fell into ruin and little remains of them. There is no official signage on the site. Perhaps a local name for a creek that enters the Saskatchewan on the south side of the river opposite the site commemorates the old forts - its name is Fort Creek. Fourth Fort Edmonton (1813‚Äì1830)  Coordinates: Fort Edmonton and Fort Augustus moved back to the second site at the Rossdale flats, it having proven to be a site more amenable for the tribes to visit. The name Fort Augustus was dropped following the forced merger of the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company in 1821. After the amalgamation of the companies (which thereafter used the Hudson's Bay Company name), Fort Edmonton became the headquarters for the Saskatchewan District of Rupert's Land, which stretched from the Canadian Rocky Mountains in the west to Fort Carlton in the east; from the 49th parallel in the south to Lesser Slave Lake in the north. The former Nor' Wester John Rowand was placed in charge of Edmonton in 1821 as chief trader. In 1823, Rowand was promoted to chief factor. Rowand managed Saskatchewan District from Fort Edmonton until his death in 1854. Fifth Fort Edmonton (1830‚Äì1915) Coordinates: Due to floods in the late 1820s, the Fort on the Rossdale flats had to be moved to higher ground in 1830. This fifth and final fort stood for 85 years, though its use as a fur trading post was phased out starting in 1891; during its final years, the Fort co-existed with the Alberta Legislature Building, which opened in 1913 on a rise just north of the fort.Canadian Parliamentary Review ‚Äì Article Fort Edmonton, 1870. =Rowand's administration= At this time, a long-serving member of the HBC, John Edward Harriott, became the chief trader under Rowand. The two gained family ties when Harriott married one of Rowand's daughters. On a couple of occasions when Rowand joined HBC Inland Governor George Simpson for travel abroad, Harriott acted as chief factor. Rowand's administration from the 1830s onward coincided with a great change in the Saskatchewan District. For the first time, missionaries, artists, and curious travellers came to Edmonton to visit, sometimes for extended periods, which frustrated Rowand to some degree. Prior to this time, the only Europeans to come that far into the west were men on some sort of company business. With Rowand having made Edmonton his home, the fort became an important centre in the west. It was a necessity for any traveller going any further west of Edmonton to go through there for provisions first. Rowand constructed a three- storey house in the heart of the fort for the exclusive use of him and his family, denoting his station to his subordinates, visitors and trade partners alike. Influx of missionaries Two Catholic missionaries, Francois- Norbert Blanchet and Modeste Demers, were the first to visit Fort Edmonton (called Fort-des-Prairies) in 1838. Starting in 1840, the Fort housed the Wesleyan missionary Robert Rundle as a company chaplain. Rundle's tenure lasted until 1848, and his ministry and missionary work was met with competition of a sort by Jean-Baptiste Thibault, a Catholic priest who, like Rundle, was attempting to evangelize natives in the area. A chapel was erected inside the fort in 1843, which the Reverend Rundle boasted could host \\"(one) hundred Indians\\"; the structure also had two small rooms for Rundle's private use. Meanwhile, Rowand complained that the presence of ministers in his fort was a distraction for the natives, and was ostensibly impeding the fur trade business. On a personal level, however, Rowand had taken a liking to Rundle, and entrusted the minister with teaching his children. Father Pierre-Jean De Smet spent the winter of 1845-46 at Fort Edmonton having traveled and explored from Oregon Country to meet the natives of the Rocky Mountains. In 1852, the Oblate missionary Albert Lacombe first visited Fort Edmonton. With Rundle having trouble controlling the department in 1848, Lacombe easily took up residence in the former Methodist chapel. Lacombe took pity on the fur trade labourers, opining that, \\"during the summer months, [Hudson's Bay labourers' toil] was as hard as that of the African slave.\\". He found little sympathy for the workers from John Rowand or the HBC clerks. The following year, Lacombe moved to Lac St. Anne, but had a new Catholic chapel constructed in the fort in 1857 (but did not dwell there); this chapel lasted nearly twenty years before being moved outside of the fort. A Methodist follow-up to Robert Rundle, Reverend Thomas Woolsey, was dispatched to Edmonton in 1852. His arrival in the fort coincided with Lacombe's residency in the former Methodist chapel, a discovery which distressed Woolsey. Conflicts and private frustrations with Catholic missionaries, and failures to convert Catholics to Protestantism, marked Woolsey's twelve-year residence at the fort. In 1854, the mission St. Joachim was officially founded in turn at Fort-des-Praires (Fort Edmonton). Oregon mission This watercolor with a scale diagram of the Fort was drawn by Vavasour in 1846. Though somewhat distant from the territory in question, Fort Edmonton, an important stop on the York Factory Express overland trade route, was peripherally involved in the Oregon Boundary Dispute. A pair of British Army lieutenants, Mervin Vavasour and Henry James Warre, were sent on a mission in the guise of eccentric gentlemen to reconnoitre the lower Columbia River valley and Puget Sound. Among other objectives, they were to determine which HBC posts could be used in a military conflict.ABCBookWorld Cover Story ‚Äì Warre's War The trip had been encouraged by Sir George Simpson Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company. Warre and Vavasour reported that the mountain passes were unsuitable for troop transport. Their mission took them through Fort Edmonton in the fall of 1845, and again on their way back to Montreal in 1846. They wrote: \\"Without attempting to describe the numerous Defiles through which we passed, or the difficulty of forcing a passage through the burnt Forests, and over the high land, we may venture to assert, that Sir George Simpson's idea of transporting troops. . . with their stores, etc. through such an extent of uncultivated Country and over such impracticable Mountains would appear to Us quite unfeasible.\\" As with other forts he visited on this mission, Vavasour drew a plan of Edmonton. Other notable visitors Artist Paul Kane's romanticized painting of the fifth fort (1849, from 1846 sketch), displaying Rowand's house rising high above the palisade. The artist Paul Kane first visited the fort in 1845. He produced several works of art based upon his time there. Rowand's end In May 1854, John Rowand died while accompanying the annual York Boat trip eastward. Accounts suggest that he tried to break up (or join) a skirmish between some of the tripmen while at Fort Pitt, and in his rage he fell suddenly dead. He was initially buried at Fort Pitt, but was later exhumed and buried in Montreal as per his last will and testament. =Remaining years= Remaining administrators Following a few short-lived administrations in Rowand's wake, William J. Christie was a long-lasting chief factor at Edmonton from 1858 to 1872. Christie's prot√©g√© Richard Charles Hardisty, later a Canadian Senator, served as chief factor in Edmonton for an interim period from 1862 through 1864. The Hudson's Bay Company relinquished Rupert's Land to the Government of Canada in 1868, pursuant to the Rupert's Land Act 1868, thus ending the HBC's administration of the vast territory and beginning an era of settlement in the 1870s. By the 1890s, the fort was in disrepair and largely abandoned. The Hudson's Bay Company transitioned to retail stores, and business in Edmonton ran from one of those instead. Explorers In 1841 James Sinclair stopped at Fort Edmonton to receive instructions on where to cross the Rockies. With him were about 116 to 121 mostly M√©tis settlers from the Red River Colony, hired by the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company to settle on Fort Nisqually and Cowlitz Farm within modern Washington state. Captain John Palliser stayed in Fort Edmonton for a time in 1858 while on his famous expedition. With the help of the factor's wife, Palliser held a ball there.John Palliser and Henry Hind ‚Äì The Arctic and More ‚Äì 19th Century ‚Äì Pathfinders and Passageways In 1859, the 9th Earl of Southesk visited on his way to the Rocky Mountains, hoping that the fresh mountain air would improve his health.Alberta museum lands bulk of rare aboriginal collection Under threat of warfare Fort Edmonton, near the new Legislature Building, 1914. The spring of 1870 saw Fort Edmonton come under the threat of violence due to a war between the Blackfoot and Cree, resulting from the slaying of Cree Chief Maskipiton. A group of the Blackfoot approaching the fort from the south caught some traders with wagons of goods on the south bank. The traders escaped by ferry but had to leave their wagons behind. The ferry was not sent to the Blackfoot and were not able to give chase as they were unable to ford the North Saskatchewan due to high spring waters. They encamped in today's Walterdale neighbourhood of Edmonton, plundered the wagons and harassed the fort with their muskets. The men in the fort armed themselves and prepared to fight. But the fort was not attacked in force. The Chief Factor William J. Christie ordered the Bay men not to go out to attack the Blackfoot, apprehensive that to do so would invite further violence against the Hudson's Bay Company. Fifteen years later, on March 19, 1885, during the North West Rebellion, Edmonton's telegraph wire was cut. Fearing imminent attack, many local settlers and their families took shelter behind the fort's old wooden palisade. No attack happened. Within a few weeks marching and mounted troops arrived from southern Alberta and from eastern Canada by way of the CPR station at Calgary, to ensure that no local outbreak would occur. Dismantling What remained of the fifth Fort Edmonton was dismantled in 1915. It was seen as a crumbling eyesore next to the Alberta Legislature Building, which had been completed three years earlier.Real Estate Weekly The Government of Alberta indicated at the time that it would use the old fort's timbers to create a heritage site elsewhere in the city, but it never did.

In 1959, the site of the fourth Fort Edmonton (Fort Edmonton III) was also made a National Historic Site and plaque was installed near the Alberta Legislature building. Similarly the Fort Edmonton-Fort Gary Trail was also named a National Historic Site and a plaque for it was installed in Edmonton in 1996.

He was the first Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives, serving from 1854 to 1860. Early life Clifford was born in Mount Vernon, Scotforth, Lancashire, England. Related to the Barons Clifford of Chudleigh, he came from a wealthy background, and his parents were well-connected. After attending Stonyhurst College, Clifford set out for New Zealand with his cousin William Vavasour, leaving in 1842. Arriving in the New Zealand Company settlement of Wellington, the two established a land, shipping and commissions agency with finance from their parents. They later expanded their holdings, establishing a considerable number of farming ventures. Clifford also worked in partnership with Frederick Weld, another cousin. At the same time, he was active in the Wellington militia, attaining the rank of captain. He was in charge of Clifford's Stockade in Johnsonville north of Wellington in the mid-1840s.

(having previously been Speaker for the Wellington Provincial Council). He remains the youngest ever Speaker, having been appointed at the age of forty-one. He was Member of the New Zealand Parliament for the City of Wellington from until his retirement as its speaker in 1860. The most challenging event to arise during Clifford's speakership was the prorogation of Parliament by Robert Wynyard, the acting Governor. Wynyard, objecting to Parliament's denial that it required royal assent to establish New Zealand's self-rule, ordered Parliament to be suspended. Parliament, however, chose to suspend its own standing orders, allowing it to leave Wynyard's instructions officially \\"unopened\\" while it continued to debate. The possibility of suspending standing orders was challenged by Wynyard's supporters, but Clifford eventually decided to allow it. Clifford also allowed the proposal and passage of a motion condemning Wynyard's attempt prorogation.  Retirement and later life  Clifford retired from Parliament in 1860, deciding to return to England. He did, however, retain a considerable interest in New Zealand's affairs, and advised British authorities on a number of matters. In 1866, he presented the New Zealand Parliament with a ceremonial mace similar to the one used in the British House of Commons. He also retained considerable business interests in New Zealand.

It is also known as the \\"Butler Act\\" after the President of the Board of Education, R. A. Butler. Historians consider it a \\"triumph for progressive reform,\\" and it became a core element of the post-war consensus supported by all major parties. The Act was repealed in steps with the last parts repealed in 1996. Background The basis of the 1944 Education Act was a memorandum entitled Education After the War (commonly referred to as the \\"Green Book\\") which was compiled by Board of Education officials and distributed to selected recipients in June 1941. The President of the Board of Education at that time was Butler's predecessor, Herwald Ramsbotham; Butler succeeded him on 20 July 1941. The Green Book formed the basis of the 1943 White Paper, Educational Reconstruction which was itself used to formulate the 1944 Act. The purpose of the Act was to address the country's educational needs amid demands for social reform that had been an issue before the Second World War began. The Act incorporated proposals developed by leading specialists in the 1920s and 1930s such as R. H. Tawney and William Henry Hadow. The text of the Act was drafted by Board of Education officials including Griffiths G. Williams, William Cleary, H. B. Wallis, S. H. Wood, Robert S. Wood, and Maurice Holmes. There was a desire to keep the churches involved in education but they could not afford to modernise without government help. By negotiation with the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple (1881-1944), and other religious leaders, a majority of the Anglican church schools became voluntary controlled and were effectively absorbed into the state system in return for funding. The Act also encouraged non-sectarian religious teaching in secular schools. A third of the Anglican church schools became voluntary aided which entitled them to enhanced state subsidies whilst retaining autonomy over admissions, curriculum and teacher appointments; Roman Catholic schools also chose this option. The legislation was enacted in 1944, but its changes were designed to take effect after the war, thus allowing for additional pressure groups to have their influence. Paul Addison argues that in the end, the act was widely praised by Conservatives because it honoured religion and social hierarchy, by Labour because it opened new opportunities for working class children, and by the general public because it ended the fees they had to pay for secondary education. State primary education had been free since the 1891 Education Act; even after 1944 certain older grammar schools ‚Äì the direct grant grammar schools ‚Äì continued to charge fees but also admitted state pupils on scholarships. New policies Butler designed the Act as an expression of \\"One Nation Conservatism\\" in the tradition attributed to Disraeli, which called for paternalism by the upper class towards the working class.Brian Simon, \\"The 1944 Education Act: A Conservative Measure?,\\" History of Education. (1986) 15#1 pp 31‚Äì43 The Act sharply distinguished between primary and secondary education at age 11 and ended the traditional all-age (5-14) elementary sector, enforcing the division between primary (5‚Äì11 years old) and secondary (11‚Äì15 years old) education that many local authorities had already introduced. It abolished fees on parents for state secondary schools. It brought a more equitable funding system to localities and to different school sectors. The Act renamed the Board of Education as the Ministry of Education, giving it greater powers and a bigger budget. While defining the school leaving age as 15, it granted the government the power to raise the age to 16 \\"as soon as the Minister is satisfied that it has become practicable\\",Education Act 1944, Section 35 though the change was not implemented until 1973. It also brought in a new system for setting teacher salaries. One of the results of the Act was to increase the openness of secondary schools to girls and the working class, educating and mobilising them. Another result was that the percentage of children attending higher education tripled from 1% to 3%. The Act provided both for nursery schools and Further Education programs through community colleges, offering education for both children and adults, a measure that was only followed through by a few LEAs such as the Cambridgeshire Village Colleges, Leicestershire Community Colleges and Coventry, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire community schools. Anglican schools were continued, but brought under increased state funding and control. Every state-funded school was required to begin the day with a nondenominational religious prayer.Secularists and rationalists opposed this and other provisions. See for example Brown (n.d.) This clause was amended by the Education Reform Act 1988, which specified that the act of worship should be of a 'broadly Christian nature' unless such a message was deemed to be inappropriate for a particular school or group of children. The amendment also specified that the act of worship could now take place in classes, rather than the previous system of conducting worship in assemblies. The Act was supported by HORSA (Hutting Operation for the Raising of the School-Leaving Age) a building programme to provide 'hut'-style accommodation to meet the additional educational demand. School meals and milk Five children enjoy their morning milk in a classroom in 1942. The Education Act 1944 made it a duty of local education authorities to provide school meals and milk. The authority could remit the charge for the meal in cases of hardship. The separate School Milk Act 1946 provided free milk (a third of a pint a day) in schools to all children under the age of 18. In 1968 Edward Short, the Labour Secretary of State for Education and Science, withdrew free milk from secondary schools. His successor, Conservative Margaret Thatcher withdrew free school milk from children over seven in 1971, earning her (among her enemies) the nickname 'Thatcher, the Milk Snatcher'. Shirley Williams abolished school milk for children under seven in 1977.

The bridge was built jointly by the Oregon Department of Transportation and Washington State Department of Transportation. Construction on the structure began on November 5, 1962, and the concrete piers were cast at Tongue Point, upriver. The steel structure was built in segments at Vancouver, Washington, upriver, then barged downstream where hydraulic jacks lifted them into place. The bridge opened to traffic on July 29, 1966, marking the completion of U.S. Route 101 and becoming the seventh major bridge built by Oregon in the 1950s‚Äì60s; ferry service ended the night before. On August 27, 1966, Governors Mark Hatfield of Oregon and Dan Evans of Washington dedicated the bridge by cutting a ceremonial ribbon. The four-day ceremony was celebrated by 30,000 attendees who participated in parades, drives, and a marathon boat race from Portland to Astoria. The cost of the project was $24 million, equivalent to $ today, and was paid for by tolls that were removed on December 24, 1993, more than two years early.

Designed by William Adair Bugge construction of the cantilever truss bridge was completed by the DeLong Corporation, the American Bridge Company, and Pomeroy Gerwick. The south end is located at beside what used to be the toll plaza, at the end of a inclined ramp which goes through a full 360¬∞ loop while gaining elevation over land to provide almost of clearance over the shipping channel. The north end is at and connects directly to SR 401. Since most of the northern portion of the bridge is over shallow, non-navigable water, it is low to the water. Repainting the bridge was planned for May 2009 through 2011 and budgeted at $20 million, to be shared by the states of Oregon and Washington. A four-year planned paint stripping and repainting project was planned for March 2012 through December 2016. Pedestrians Normally, only motor vehicles and bicycles are allowed on the bridge‚Äînot pedestrians.Oregon Department of Transportation: Oregon Coast Bike Route There is no sidewalk and the shoulders are too narrow for pedestrians adjacent to traffic. However, one day a year‚Äîusually in October‚Äîthe bridge is host to the Great Columbia Crossing.passport2oregon.com: Astoriahttp://www.greatcolumbiacrossing.com/ Participants are taken by shuttle to the Washington side, from where they run or walk to the Oregon side on a route across the bridge. Motor traffic is allowed to use only one lane (of two lanes) and is advised to expect delays during the two-hour event. For the first time, during the 2018 event, the Oregon Department of Transportation announced that the bridge would be closed to motor traffic.Bridge closure for Great Columbia Crossing: Daily Astorian Popular culture The bridge itself is featured prominently in the movies Short Circuit, Kindergarten Cop, Free Willy, Free Willy 2, and The Goonies. It stands in for the doomed fictional Madison Bridge in Irwin Allen's 1979 made- for-TV disaster movie The Night the Bridge Fell Down. Songwriter Sufjan Stevens most likely references the bridge in his song \\"Should Have Known Better\\" off his album Carrie & Lowell as a metaphor for dealing with his grief from the death of his mother.

DASH is capable of recording two channels of audio on a quarter-inch tape, and 24 or 48 tracks on tape on open reels of up to 14 inches. The data is recorded on the tape linearly, with a stationary recording head, as opposed to the DAT format, where data is recorded helically with a rotating head, in the same manner as a VCR. The audio data is encoded as linear PCM and boasts strong cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error correction, allowing the tape to be physically edited with a razor blade as analog tape would, e.g. by cutting and splicing, and played back with no loss of signal. In a two-track DASH recorder, the digital data is recorded onto the tape across nine data tracks: eight for the digital audio data and one for the CRC data; there is also provision for two linear analog cue tracks and one additional linear analog track dedicated to recording time code. Digital audio recorders are fundamentally high bit-rate data recorders storing PCM encoded audio data. The main advantage of any digital recording medium is that of consistent, flat frequency response, high dynamic range audio reproduction compared to analog tape recorders, which is why some of the first uses of digital audio recording were for classical music. To further increase usable dynamic range, early DASH recorders included a specialized circuit called \\"Emphasis\\" which was intended to help overcome the noise of analog to digital and digital to analog converters of the time by boosting high frequencies on the front end. This circuit required complimentary de-emphasis on playback after the DAC for accurate reproduction. While emphasis was almost a necessity in earlier units, the circuit, of course, had a sound of its own and was used less and less as converter design improved. There were three families of DASH recorders produced by Sony and Studer, with few differences among them: *2 track: PCM-3402, PCM-3202, Studer D820x *24 track: PCM-3324, PCM-3324A, PCM-3324S *48 track: PCM-3348, PCM-3348HR, and the Studer D820 and D827 *TASCAM also produced a 24-track DASH recorder, the DA-800/24. With the exception of the Sony PCM-3348HR and Studer D827, all of the DASH recorders have 16-bit resolution with a 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz sampling rate, although it is possible to use an outboard analog-to-digital converter of up to 20-bit resolution. The PCM-3348HR and D827 are capable of 24-bit 48 kHz operation at 45 ips, and are the only machines that still find significant use today, often in only the highest-end studios for music and film production. All DASH recorders primarily use the SDIF-2 (Sony Digital Interface Format-2) as a digital interface, which is slightly different than the S/PDIF / AES-EBU that nearly all other digital audio recorders use, but is technically superior because SDIF-2's word clock is not multiplexed into the bitstream. Because SDIF-2 is often only found on the expensive DASH recorders, it is also often only found on the highest-end mixing consoles, such as those made by Solid State Logic. Tape One significant advantage offered by DASH recorders over the analog recorders of the day was that 'proper' tape biasing was unimportant, as there is no means for the tape to 'color' the sound of the recorded data. This was a nice advantage, and routine maintenance amounted to not much more than keeping the tape guides clean. Due to this fact, the formulation of tape does not change the sound quality, unlike analog machines which must be set for specific formulae. The 2-track DASH machines use 1/4\\" wide tape, while the 24 and 48 track versions use 1/2\\" wide tape. One interesting thing of note is that the 24-track machines only utilize half of the tape's width, and can be played on the 48-track machines with no modifications. Similarly, the 48-track tapes can be played on a 24-track machine, but only the first 24 tracks are capable of being reproduced. DASH recorders (as well as any other type of digital recorder using magnetic tape) require the use of metal-particle formulation magnetic tape. Some examples of metal particle tape compatible with DASH machines are 3M Scotch 275, Ampex / Quantegy 467, EMTEC 931, and Sony's own tape formulation. These tape formulations are not directly compatible with any analog open-reel tape recorder. The DASH format is not compatible with the only other popular open reel stationary head digital recording format, Mitsubishi's ProDigi, which was available as 2-, 16-, and 32-track variations.

Recording heads are generally classified according to the physical principle that allows them to impress their data upon their medium. A recording head is often mechanically paired with a playback head, which, though proximal to, is often discrete from the record head. Types The two most common forms of recording head are: * Magnetic - Magnetic recording heads use the principles of electromagnetism to coerce a paramagnetic recording medium, such as iron oxides, to orient in a readable manner such as magnetic tape. Record heads are constructed of laminated permalloy, ferrite, or sendust. As of 2006, this is the most dominant type of head in use. * Optical - Optical recording heads use the principles of optics and light to impart energy on a recording medium, which accepts the energy in a readable manner, e.g. by melting or photography. Note that Magneto-optical recording, though using optics and heat, should properly be considered a magnetic process, since the data stored on magneto-optical media is stored magnetically. Earlier systems, such as phonograph records, used mechanical heads known as styli to physically cut grooves in the recording medium, in a configuration (of size, width, depth and position) recoverable as sound.

(\\"Dame Jone de Cobham lies here, may God have mercy on her soul. Whosoever shall pray for her soul shall have forty days of pardon\\"). Concerning the famous Cobham brasses William Belcher in his Kentish Brasses (1905) stated: Kent is peculiarly rich in Brasses. It has, perhaps, a larger number and a more representative collection than any other county, although individually finer examples may be found elsewhere. No church in the world possesses such a splendid series as the nineteen brasses in Cobham Church, ranging in date between 1298 and 1529.William Belcher, Kentish Brasses, Preface, Vol.2 Thirteen of the brasses belong to the years 1320‚Äì1529 and commemorate members of the Cobham family and of the Brooke family, their heirs. Career He was made Constable of Rochester Castle for life in 1303/4, of Dover Castle, of Tonbridge Castle in 1324 and of Canterbury, all in Kent. He was Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1307 and between 1315 and 1320 and he served thrice as Sheriff of Kent (1300‚Äì1301, 1307 and 1315). On 8 January 1312/13 he was created Baron Cobham \\"of Kent\\" (to distinguish his title from that of his first cousin Baron Cobham \\"of Rundale\\") by writ. He presided at the arraignment of Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere for treason at Canterbury in 1322.  Marriage and issue  At sometime before July 1285, he married Maud de Moreville, widow of Matthew de Columbers (d. pre-1284) (whom she had married before 1284), and a daughter of Eudes de Moreville. By his wife he had issue including: *John de Cobham, 2nd Baron Cobham (d. 1355), son and heir.

He was Director General (DG) of MI5 from 1953 to 1956, and Head of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) from 1956 to 1968. Early life White was born in Tonbridge, Kent, the son of an ironmonger Percy Hall White and Gertrude Farthing and went to school at Bishop's Stortford College. He took a First Class Degree in History in Christ Church, Oxford, and learnt to speak German. He was athletic in his youth and obtained a blue in running at Oxford. He was described by Peter Wright as resembling David Niven: \\"the same perfect English manners, easy charm, and immaculate dress sense.\\" He was, said Wright, \\"tall with lean, healthy features and a sharp eye\\".Wright, Peter, Spycatcher, Stoddart (Canada), 1987, p. 40 (paperback) He would qualify for a Commonwealth Fellowship in 1928 which saw him seek further education in the United States at the University of Michigan and California. After returning to the UK, he failed to obtain a position at Christ Church, Oxford and after bring rejected by the navy, he obtained work in Croyden as a teacher. He was spotted by a recruiter in 1935 while on Mediterranean cruise with his students and invited to an interview with Guy Liddell at MI5. Career He was employed at MI5 in 1936 to monitor the rise of Nazism in Germany and spent a year in Munich attempting to recruit Germans. When back from Germany, he worked with Jona Ustinov to identify potential recruits. He was a co-creator of the Double-Cross system in 1940, to turn Abwehr agents in the UK and elsewhere. He would eventually become Liddell's assistant director in B Division. By 1943, he was seconded to SHAEF as a special advisor on counter- intelligence ending the war as a brigadier. He was sent to Berlin at the end of the war to investigate Hitler's fate. He returned to MI5 in 1947 as head of its counter-intelligence division. In 1949, he was warned by the FBI of a Soviet spy at Harwell, the UK's Atomic Energy Research Establishment. Investigation identified Klaus Fuchs who was later interrogated and confessed to being a spy for the Soviets. White and MI5 were still in denial of the state of the Soviet penetration until the FBI discovered a spy via the Venona project called \\"Homer\\" working in British government. Kim Philby would warn the KGB in 1951, that Donald Mclean, now in the UK, had been identified as \\"Homer\\" and Guy Burgess was sent to warn him. White attempted to track the latter two to France but they had escaped. Their arrival in Moscow compromised Philby's position. Under a cloud of suspicion raised by his highly visible and intimate association with Burgess, Philby returned to London. There, he underwent MI5 interrogation by White aimed at ascertaining whether he had acted as a \\"third man\\" in Burgess and Maclean's spy ring. In July 1951, he resigned from MI6, preempting his all-but-inevitable dismissal.S.J. Hamrick (2004) Deceiving the Deceivers: Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 137. Philby was cleared a few years later by Harold Macmillan. By 1953, White was appointed as director-general of MI5 and in 1956 was appointed Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service in 1956 in the wake of the \\"Crabb Affair\\", the exposure of which had damaged Soviet- British relations and embarrassed MI6 and clashed with Anthony Eden and Macmillan over their handling of the Suez Crisis.Turner, Barry, Suez 1956: The Inside Story of the First Oil War, Hodder & Stoughton, 2006, p.171 Much as Peter Wright liked White, he felt his move to MI6 was a mistake for both MI5 and MI6: \\"Just as his work [at MI5] was beginning, he was moved on a politician's whim to an organisation he knew little about, and which was profoundly hostile to his arrival. He was never to be as successful there as he had been in MI5.\\"Wright, Spycatcher, p. 96 During his tenure at MI6, he rebuilt the organisations relationship with Whitehall and the CIA. This was especially true when MI6 recruited Oleg Penkovsky, a GRU Colonel that led to the identification of MI6 officer George Blake in 1963 as Soviet spy. White had always suspected Kim Philby of being the \\"third man\\". When he found out that Philby had been employed as freelance MI6 agent in Beruit, he sent Nicholas Elliott to interrogate Philby and encourage him to return to London. Philby fled to Moscow. By 1964, he was aware of the \\"Fourth Man\\" when Anthony Blunt confessed his knowledge of the other three spies for immunity. White's cover was blown in 1967, when he was identified by the Saturday Evening Post magazine. White would retire in 1968 and became the British Cabinet's first Intelligence Co-ordinator before retiring for good in 1972. Marriage In 1945, he married Kathleen Bellamy and they four children, Adrian, Frances, Jenny and Stephen. Honours Honoured many times throughout his career, he given a OBE in 1942, a CBE in 1950, a KBE in 1955 and finally a KCMG in 1960. Other honours include a Legion of Merit and a Croix de Guerre. Death He died after a long illness at his home from intestinal cancer, \\"The Leat\\" in Burpham, near Arundel in Sussex, on 21 February 1993; his wife, Kate, survived him.

The Bruces sketch is a comedy sketch that originally appeared in a 1970 episode of the television show Monty Python's Flying Circus, episode 22, \\"How to Recognise Different Parts of the Body\\", and was subsequently performed on audio recordings and live on many occasions by the Monty Python team. In reference to the sketch, Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson used the stage name \\"Bruce Bruce\\" while a member of the British hard rock band Samson. Description Eric Idle at Monty Python Live (Mostly), 2014. The sketch involves a group of stereotypical \\"ocker\\" Australians of the period, who are all wearing khakis and cork hats. All are named Bruce, hence being known as the Bruces. The skit begins with a group of men named Bruce sitting at a table, as someone sings Waltzing Matilda in the background. The Bruces are revealed to be the Philosophy Department at the fictitious University of Woolamaloo (see below). The department appears to be situated in nothing more than a simple wooden building somewhere near Uluru/Ayers Rock (which is visible in the distance behind them) in Australia's Northern Territory. The Bruces all have a common fondness for lager beer and a dislike of \\"poofters\\" (a derogatory Australian and English slang word for a homosexual). Terry Jones plays a \\"pommie\\" professor, Michael Baldwin, joining the department and meeting his colleagues for the first time. Since his name is different from that of everyone else, Baldwin is asked if he minds being called \\"Bruce\\" to avoid confusion. John Cleese's character (who in a later sketch is called Bruce Beer) recites the seven faculty rules at the University of Woolamaloo: # No poofters. # No member of the faculty is to maltreat the \\"Abos\\" in any way whatsoever‚Äîif there's anyone watching. # No poofters. # I don't want to catch anyone not drinking in their room after lights out. # No poofters. # There is no rule six. # No poofters. Versions The sketch featured on the Matching Tie and Handkerchief album and in many of the team's stage shows, where it would be capped with a performance of \\"The Philosophers' Song\\". Free cans of Fosters beer were tossed to the audience with the addition of a joke about American beer given at Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl. The song does not feature in the original television version, which instead ends with the first Bruce saying \\"Sidney Nolan! What's that?\\" pointing to the ear of fourth Bruce returning to that episode's running joke, \\"how to recognise different parts of the body\\", with the voice over saying, \\"Number nine. The ear.\\" (the TV sketch began with \\"Number eight. The kneecap.\\" and a closeup of the First Bruce's knee). A slightly different version of the sketch is recorded on Monty Python Live at Drury Lane. The identity of \\"Bruce\\" is Lauchlan Chipman, Professor of Philosophy and friend of Michael Palin. Chipman was the founding Chairman of the Philosophy Department at the University of Wollongong. Development Eric Idle co-wrote the sketch with Cleese and said he based it on his Australian friends from the 1960s \\"who always seemed to be called Bruce\\". Australian film director Bruce Beresford was friends with Idle while Idle was living in Notting Hill.Question answered by Idle at VIP Meet and Greet session after Monty Python: Nearly Live at O2 on 19 July 2014 The fictional University of Woolamaloo is based on either a misspelling of, or a name derived from, the Sydney suburb of Woolloomooloo; this is how the suburb is actually pronounced with an Australian accent. As mentioned above, Palin's friend Lauchlan Chipman founded the Philosophy Department at the University of Wollongong.

Modern depiction of Vyasa narrating the Mahabharata to Ganesha at the Murudeshwara temple, Karnataka. A national epic is an epic poem or a literary work of epic scope which seeks or is believed to capture and express the essence or spirit of a particular nation‚Äînot necessarily a nation state, but at least an ethnic or linguistic group with aspirations to independence or autonomy. National epics frequently recount the origin of a nation, a part of its history, or a crucial event in the development of national identity such as other national symbols. In a broader sense, a national epic may simply be an epic in the national language which the people or government of that nation are particularly proud of. It is distinct from a pan-national epic which is taken as representative of a larger cultural or linguistic group than a nation or a nation-state. History First page of Beowulf in Cotton Vitellius A. xv J√°n Holl√Ω - author of the Slovak national epic poem Svatopluk. Elias L√∂nnrot - author of the Finnish national epic poem Kalevala. Dante Alighieri - author of the Divine Comedy. In medieval times Homer's Iliad was taken to be based on historical facts, and the Trojan War came to be considered as seminal in the genealogies of European monarchies.Paul Cohen, \\"In search of the Trojan Origins of French\\", in Fantasies of Troy, Classical Tales and the Social Imaginary in Medieval and Early Modern Europe, Alan Shepard, Stephen David Powell eds., published by the Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies, 2004, p. 65 sq., . \\"Like many of their counterparts across Europe, seventh-century scholars in France had invented a myth of the Trojan origins of Gaul\\" (p. 67) Virgil's Aeneid was taken to be the Roman equivalent of the Iliad, starting from the Fall of Troy and leading up to the birth of the young Roman nation. According to the then prevailing conception of history, empires were born and died in organic succession and correspondences existed between the past and the present. Geoffrey of Monmouth's 12th century classically inspired Historia Regum Britanniae, for example, fulfilled this function for the British or Welsh. Just as kings longed to emulate great leaders of the past, Alexander or Caesar, it was a temptation for poets to become a new Homer or Virgil. In 16th century Portugal, Luis de Cam√µes celebrated Portugal as a naval power in his Os Lus√≠adas while Pierre de Ronsard set out to write La Franciade, an epic meant to be the Gallic equivalent of Virgil's poem that also traced back France's ancestry to Trojan princes.Epic Liliane Kesteloot, University of Dakar The emergence of a national ethos, however, preceded the coining of the phrase national epic, which seems to originate with Romantic nationalism. Where no obvious national epic existed, the \\"Romantic spirit\\" was motivated to fill it. An early example of poetry that was invented to fill a perceived gap in \\"national\\" myth is Ossian, the narrator and supposed author of a cycle of poems by James Macpherson, which Macpherson claimed to have translated from ancient sources in Scottish Gaelic. However, many national epics (including Macpherson's Ossian) antedate 19th-century romanticism. In the early 20th century, the phrase no longer necessarily applies to an epic poem, and occurs to describe a literary work that readers and critics agree is emblematical of the literature of a nation, without necessarily including details from that nation's historical background. In this context the phrase has definitely positive connotations, as for example in James Joyce's Ulysses where it is suggested Don Quixote is Spain's national epic while Ireland's remains as yet unwritten: > They remind one of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet > to be written, Dr Sigerson says. Moore is the man for it. A knight of the > rueful countenance here in Dublin.James Joyce.

The fourth-oldest medical school in the United States, it was founded in 1797 by New England physician Nathan Smith and grew steadily over the course of the 19th century. Several milestones in medical care and research have taken place at Dartmouth, including the first clinical X-ray (1896), the first intensive care unit in the United States (1955), and the Brattleboro rat (1961). Today, Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine continues to grant the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees, as well as a Master of Public Health (M.P.H.) and Master of Science (M.S.) degrees. The school has a student body of about 700 students and more than 2,300 faculty members and researchers. Geisel organizes research through over a dozen research centers and institutes, receiving more than $140 million in grants annually. The Geisel School of Medicine is one of seven Ivy League medical schools and is ranked as a \\"top medical school\\" by U.S. News & World Report for both primary care and biomedical research. Dartmouth's medical school has numerous clinical partners, including Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, White River Junction Veterans Administration Medical Center, California Pacific Medical Center, and Manchester Veterans Administration Medical Center.  History  Nathan Smith, the founder of Dartmouth Medical School. = Foundation and early years = Dartmouth's medical school was founded in 1797 as the fourth medical school in the United States, following the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine (founded 1765), the medical school of King's College (now Columbia University) (1767), and Harvard Medical School (1782). The founder was Nathan Smith, a Harvard University and University of Edinburgh Medical School educated physician from Cornish, New Hampshire. Noting the dearth of medical professionals in the rural Connecticut River Upper Valley area, Smith petitioned the Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College in August 1796 to fund the establishment of a medical school to train more physicians for the region. Though Dartmouth College as a whole was financially strapped, the Board approved the request, and Smith began lecturing on November 22, 1797. For much of its early life, the school consisted only of Nathan Smith and a small class of students, operating in borrowed space at Dartmouth College. Students of Smith were educated as apprentices, and received a Bachelor of Medicine degree upon graduation. Like Dartmouth College as a whole, the medical school had continual funding shortages. As time passed, however, the popularity of both the medical instruction and the basic sciences taught at the school drew undergraduates and training physicians alike. Soliciting funds from the state of New Hampshire, Smith was able to obtain medical equipment and, by 1811, a dedicated physical plant for the school. Smith acted as the sole administrator and instructor of the medical school until 1810 when a second faculty member was hired. Smith also revamped the curriculum, allowing the school to begin offering the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree in 1812. Smith ultimately left Dartmouth in 1816, founding three additional schools of medicine at Yale University, Bowdoin College, and the University of Vermont. = Expansion and difficulties = Smith's departure provided for a period of expansion, both among the faculty and the student body. Former students of Nathan Smith's replaced him on the faculty, drawing medical professionals in the northeast such as Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. to join them. The first hospital at the school was founded by DMS alumnus Dixi Crosby in 1838, who used it to integrate academic instruction with hands-on patient care. In 1870, Carlton Pennington Frost, DMS '57, replaced Crosby as Dean of the school. Under Frost, the curriculum sustained another revamping, this time into a four-year program that included clinical and academic training. Frost also presided over the establishment of Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital in 1893, built to replace Crosby's defunct hospital. The Dartmouth Medical School campus, from 1915 or earlier. In 1908, The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching conducted a survey of medical education institutions in the United States. At the time, the discipline emphasized \\"bedside teaching\\" and providing students experience with a broad variety of illnesses and patients. The school's rural location was deemed too remote for proper clinical training, and the school was advised to stop offering the Doctor of Medicine degree and only provide pre-clinical instruction. The class of 1914 was the last (until 1974) to receive the Doctor of Medicine degree; subsequent classes of students attended DMS for two years before transferring to other medical schools. The drop of clinical instruction worsened the school's problems by driving away talented faculty members. After World War II, the tide of the medical discipline had shifted towards research. Although the school was well regarded for preparing students for clinical education at other institutions, its faculty was criticized for its apparent disinterest in research. The school was also criticized for using Dartmouth College's undergraduate program as a feeder school. Based on these criticisms, DMS was placed on \\"confidential probation\\" in 1956 by the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Council on Medical Education. = From the \\"refounding\\" to present = Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital (right), circa 1915. At the time of the probation, Dartmouth College had already anticipated the medical school's plight, amassing capital to fund a revitalization of the school. In 1956, the trustees of the College formally agreed to a \\"refounding\\" of the school's academic offerings, physical facilities, and faculty. S. Marsh Tenney, DMS class of 1944, was appointed to carry out this task. Tenney more than doubled the size of the faculty and the student body, added several new departments, and oversaw the construction of five new campus buildings by 1964. In the 1960s, due to a national shortage of physicians and government incentives for schools that increased their class sizes, Dartmouth Medical School graduates began to experience difficulty in trying to transfer to other medical schools to complete their final two years of medical school as other medical schools had increased their class size and could not accommodate transfer students. In the meantime, Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital had grown to be a 400-bed medical center, and Dartmouth Medical School had established a partnership with a 224-bed Veterans Administration Hospital in White River Junction, Vermont. The Doctor of Medicine program, now possible with the expanded local medical centers, was reinstated by a vote of the trustees in 1968. The admission of M.D. candidates resumed in 1970. Initially, the medical school curriculum was three years in length, unlike most medical schools, but it later was increased to the usual four years in 1979.Medicine: History , Dartmouth College Library.

A cooperative program with Brown Medical School began in 1981 where students received training at both medical schools.Medical Education at Brown: An Overview , Brown Alpert Medical School. Retrieved 2008-01-07. Fifteen to twenty students were selected for the program, which combined the first two years of basic science coursework at Dartmouth with the final two years of clinical coursework at Brown. The program balanced Dartmouth's greater basic science facilities than Brown, but fewer clinical facilities than available at the urban setting of Brown, which is located in Providence, Rhode Island. Graduates of the program received M.D. degrees from Brown. The program was discontinued in 2010.Kelleher, K. (April 25, 2007), Brown-Dartmouth medical program to end in 2010 , The Brown Daily Herald. Retrieved 2008-01-07. In 1991, the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center was established on a campus in Lebanon, New Hampshire. The three-year project, completed at the cost of $228 million, served as a replacement for the Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital, which was partially demolished in the early 1990s. A new curriculum was introduced in 1996 entitled \\"New Directions.\\" The curriculum, still in place today, seeks to promote small classes, reduce the amount of lectures, and offer students extensive interactive experience with patients. 2009 saw the successful completion of a $250 million capital campaign. On April 4, 2012, the Dartmouth Medical School was renamed the Audrey and Theodor Geisel School of Medicine in honor of their many years of generosity to the College.  Campus  The Geisel School of Medicine has facilities on the campus of Dartmouth College, which is situated in the rural, Upper Valley town of Hanover, New Hampshire as well as at its Lebanon, NH campus at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC). The medical school facilities at Dartmouth College sit in a complex on the north side of Dartmouth's campus and includes academic, administrative, research, and presentation facilities. Dartmouth Medical School is served by two libraries, the Dana Biomedical Library and the Matthews-Fuller Health Sciences Library, which together offer over 240,000 volumes. Off-campus housing is available through Dartmouth College. In addition, the Class of 1978 Life Sciences Center was completed in August 2011 at a cost of $92 million. The Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, centered in nearby Lebanon, New Hampshire, is a main affiliated teaching hospital of the Geisel School of Medicine. Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital, DHMC's 396-bed inpatient facility, acts as the medical school's teaching hospital and \\"primary teaching site\\". DHMC's other constituent elements include the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Clinic (a network of physicians in Vermont and New Hampshire) and a Veterans Affairs Medical Center in White River Junction, Vermont. In total, DHMC serves an area with a population of 1.6 million. In addition to on-campus instruction in Hanover and Lebanon, third- and fourth-year M.D. students may choose from 75 regional sites for their required clerkships. Most clerkship facilities are located in central New England, although students are also able to clerk at sites in Alaska, Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Florida.

In addition, the school offers two joint-degree programs: the combination M.D./Ph.D., for which the Ph.D. can be obtained from any doctoral program at Dartmouth, and the combination MD/MBA, offered in conjunction with the Tuck School of Business. The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, one of a number of DMS research institutes, offers its own degree programs in evaluative clinical sciences, including a Master of Public Health (MPH), a Master of Science (M.S.), a PhD, post-doctoral fellowships, several joint-degree programs, and a residency program for preventive medicine. Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital also offers residencies and fellowships which are administered by Dartmouth Medical School faculty. The curriculum for the Doctor of Medicine degree spans four years, combining required courses with electives. First-year students learn human anatomy and basic biomedical science in classes offered by the basic science departments, while beginning a two-year course of study in clinical studies. Second-year students study pathophysiology and take courses from almost every clinical and basic science department in the school. In their third year, M.D. candidates are required to participate in six eight-week Medical clerkships with area medical institutions, covering both ambulatory clinics and hospitals. The final year is spent on additional clerkships, the designation of an area of focus, and preparation for a post-graduation residency. In addition to imparting medical and clinical knowledge, the M.D. program is designed to teach \\"interpersonal and communications skills\\", \\"professionalism\\", and other practical skills for a medical career. Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine also offers the Doctor of Philosophy degree to train students as biomedical researchers and scientists. The PhD is available in six fields offered by the basic science departments: pharmacology and toxicology, molecular and cell biology, immunology, molecular pathogenesis, systems biology, and experimental and molecular medicine. Research and teaching positions at DMS and its centers and institutes are available to PhD candidates. = Organization and research = Like the undergraduate portion of Dartmouth College, the Geisel School of Medicine operates on a quarter system. As part of the larger institution, DMS is ultimately administered by Dartmouth's President and Board of Trustees. The school is directly managed by a Dean who is advised by a 22-member Board of Overseers. , the school operates on a budget of $237 million. Besides research conducted within the infrastructure of academic departments, research at Geisel is also organized around over a dozen research centers and institutes. The centers cover various medical subjects such as neuroscience, oncology (Norris Cotton Cancer Center), psychiatry, and pediatrics. Funded research at Geisel School of Medicine amounted to $140 million during the 2012-2013 academic year;  Publications  The Medical School publishes a magazine for alumni and friends, Dartmouth Medicine.Vital Signs: Touched by Medicine. In addition, the school also publishes an innovative literary journal, Lifelines (literary journal)Lifelines : a Dartmouth Medical School literary journal. Author: Dartmouth Medical School.

In the fall of 2013, 85 students enrolled in the Doctor of Medicine program from an applicant pool of 4,290, with the Office of Admissions offering an acceptance rate of 6 percent. Applicants from the previous year had an average score in the numerically graded sections of the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) of 33 and an average undergraduate grade point average (GPA) of 3.65. Applicants to the M.D. program are expected to have a background in chemistry, biology, physics, and calculus, and are required to have at least three years of undergraduate education. In November 2013, the nation's sole medical school accrediting body, the Liaison Committee for Medical Education (LCME) granted the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine a full eight-year term of accreditation‚Äîthe longest available from the LCME. For 2020, the Geisel School of Medicine was ranked by U.S. News & World Report as 50th on the \\"Top Medical Schools ‚Äì Research\\" list and 19th on the \\"Top Medical Schools ‚Äì Primary Care\\" list.  People  = Student profile and student life = The Geisel School of Medicine's enrollment totaled 700 students: 360 M.D. candidates and 340 graduate students. In addition to the student body, over 350 resident physicians and research fellows were on campus . The student population is split approximately evenly between men and women, while about 25 percent of the student body is made up of international or minority students. From an average class size of 75, over 60 undergraduate institutions and most of the U.S. states are represented. According to The Princeton Review, the small class size at Geisel helps to establish \\"a strong sense of community and collaborative spirit\\". The school offers dozens of community service, recreational, professional, and other student groups. = Faculty = C. Everett Koop As of November 2007, the Geisel School of Medicine employs a staff of 2,315 faculty and researchers: 766 full-time faculty, 1,301 part-time faculty and non-faculty instructors, and 248 research positions. The ratio of full-time, on-site faculty to students is given by the school as 2:1. Notable current faculty include Stuart Gitlow, palliative care physician Ira Byock, former astronaut and Democratic politician Jay C. Buckey, psychoanalyst Peter A. Olsson, and Jay Dunlap, professor and chair of genetics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Notable former faculty include biochemist Mahlon Hoagland, pathologist and geneticist Kurt Benirschke, and former Surgeon General of the United States C. Everett Koop. = Alumni = As of June 2013, the Geisel School of Medicine claims 4,891 living graduates active in medicine around the world. Geisel cites its required clerkships as a mechanism for allowing students to make connections and obtain real-world experience. Fourth-year students are prepared for residency with counseling classes; recent graduates have most commonly taken their residencies at Geisel itself, Harvard Medical School, Tufts University School of Medicine, and Brown Medical School. Alumni of Geisel/Dartmouth Medical School who have become notable medical practitioners, educators and researchers include physician and freethinker Charles Knowlton, physician Robert O. Blood, ophthalmologist and epidemiologist John D. Bullock, and attending physician at the United States Capitol John Francis Eisold. Alumni in other fields include U.S. Representatives Richard S. Molony and Robert Burns, Governor of New Hampshire Noah Martin, television personality Ian Smith, and Anne Schuchat, Principal Deputy Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Biography Arthur Plantagenet was born between 1461 and 1475 in Calais, which was then an English possession in France. He died at the Tower of London, where he is buried. The identity of his mother is uncertain; the most likely candidate appears to be the \\"wanton wench\\" Elizabeth Wayte, although the historical record is spotty on this issue, and it is not entirely clear that Wayte is distinct from another of Edward's mistresses, Dame Elizabeth Lucy. Another possible candidate is Elizabeth Shore. His godfather was William FitzAlan, 16th Earl of Arundel. He spent his childhood at the court of his father Edward IV. How he passed his youth after his father's death in 1483 is not known. In 1501 he joined the household of his half-sister, the queen consort Elizabeth of York, and moved to the household of Henry VII after her death in 1503. After the accession of his nephew Henry VIII in 1509, he was formally designated an Esquire of the King's Bodyguard and was a close companion of Henry's (despite the age difference). In 1514 he was appointed High Sheriff of Hampshire and made captain of the Vice-Admiral's ship Trinity Sovereign, rising to become Vice-Admiral of England. In 1519 he and his wife, Elizabeth Grey Baroness Lisle, took possession of the lands that had belonged to her father (her brother and niece having both died). In 1520, he attended his nephew, King Henry VIII, at the Field of Cloth of Gold. On 25 April 1523, Arthur Plantagenet was created Viscount Lisle. He was also selected Privy Councilor, Governor of Calais, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and named as Constable of Calais after the death of John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners on 16 March 1533. Constable of Calais The Lisle Letters suggest that as Constable of Calais he was honest and conscientious but not especially competent. Among the letters is one from Thomas Cromwell rebuking him for referring trivial matters back to the king and Council, criticising him for his inability to refuse a favour to anyone who asks for one, and hinting that Lady Lisle's dominant influence over him has made him something of a laughing stock. Yet the Crown itself did not hesitate to employ him on routine errands: in 1537 Queen Jane Seymour during her pregnancy developed a passion for quail, and since quails were abundant in the marshes around Calais, Lisle had to devote much time to supplying them to the Queen. Imprisonment and death In 1540 several members of the Plantagenet household in Calais were arrested on suspicion of treason, on the charge of plotting to betray the town to the French. Suspicion unavoidably fell upon Arthur as well, and he was recalled to England and eventually arrested on 19 May 1540. The actual conspirators were executed, but there was no evidence connecting Arthur with the plot. Nevertheless, he languished in the Tower of London for two years until the king decided to release him. However, upon receiving news that he was to be released he suffered a heart attack and died two days later. The 18th-century historian Francis Sanford commented \\"Henry VIII's Mercy was as fatal as his Judgments\\". Lisle Letters During his time at Calais, Arthur and his wife had to manage much of their affairs outside Calais by correspondence. Copies of 3,000 of these letters were seized as evidence after Arthur was arrested. They survive in the Public Record Office, and were published in abridged form as the Lisle Letters, becoming a valuable historical resource for a critical period in English history.http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/ArthurPlantagenet(1VLisle).htm Marriages and children Arthur Plantagenet married twice, producing children by his first wife only. His first marriage was on 12 November 1511 to Elizabeth Grey (died 1529), daughter of Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Lisle (died 1492). She was the widow of Edmund Dudley, treasurer to King Henry VII, who had been executed in 1510 by Henry VIII. The next day the king granted Arthur some of the Dudley estates which had come to the crown due to Dudley's attainder. By Elizabeth he had three daughters: *Frances, who married twice: firstly to her step-brother John Basset (1520‚Äì1541)Vivian, p.47, pedigree of Basset of Umberleigh, Devon, the son of Arthur's second wife by her first marriage, Honor Grenville (died 1566); secondly Frances married Thomas Monke (c. 1515 ‚Äì c. 1583)Vivian, p.569, pedigree of Monk of Potheridge, Devon, of an ancient Devonshire family. Her great-grandson by this marriage was George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle (1608‚Äì1670). *Elizabeth, who married Sir Francis Jobson, Member of Parliament for Colchesterhttp://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/jobson- sir-francis-1509-73 *Bridget, who married William Carden [Cawarden] http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/PLANTAGENET3.htm#Bridget%20PLANTAGENET1 http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/cawarden- thomas-1514-59 Secondly, in 1529 as her second husband, he married Honor Grenville (1493‚Äì1566) the daughter of Sir Thomas Grenville (died 1513) of Stowe in the parish of Kilkhampton, Cornwall, by his wife Isabella Gilbert. She was the widow of Sir John Bassett (died 1528) of Umberleigh, Devon. Arthur had no children by Honor, but he helped to bring up her children, including John Basset, who became the husband of his daughter Frances from his first marriage; Anne Bassett, an alleged mistress of Henry VIII, and Elizabeth Bassett, a royal maid-of-honour also known as Mary Bassett.

In modern surgery, this procedure is temporarily used to direct blood flow to the lungs and relieve cyanosis while the infant is waiting for corrective or definitive surgery.One branch of the subclavian artery or carotid artery is separated and connected with the pulmonary artery. The first area of application was tetralogy of Fallot. The Blalock‚ÄìThomas-Taussig shunt is used in the first step of the three stage palliation (The Norwood Procedure). __TOC__ Alternatives Blalock‚ÄìTaussig shunt ‚Äì A/ original procedure ‚Äì B/ modified procedure The procedure is no longer in use in its original form. Now a length of artificial tubing, 3 to 4 millimeters in diameter, is sewn between either the subclavian or the carotid artery and the corresponding side branch of the pulmonary artery, thus obviating the need to cut off blood supply and making it easier to regulate the blood flow to the lungs. Some centers now use a shunt directly from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, a Sano shunt. This is done to avoid the reduced diastolic blood flow in the coronary circulation associated with the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt. History The original procedure was named for Alfred Blalock, surgeon, Culloden, GA (1899‚Äì1964), Helen B. Taussig, cardiologist, Baltimore/Boston (1898‚Äì1986) and Vivien Thomas (1910‚Äì1985) who was at that time Blalock's laboratory assistant. They all helped to develop the procedure. Taussig, who treated hundreds of infants and children with this disorder, had observed that children with a cyanotic heart defect and a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) lived longer than those without the PDA. It, therefore, seemed to her that a shunt that mimicked the function of a PDA might relieve the tetralogy patients' poor oxygenation. In 1943, having broached the possibility of a surgical solution to Robert Gross of Boston without success, Taussig approached Blalock and Thomas in their Hopkins laboratory in 1943. According to the account of the original consultation between the three provided in Vivien Thomas' 1985 autobiography Partners of the Heart, Taussig carefully described the anomaly of Tetralogy of Fallot, but made no suggestion about the specific surgical correction required, observing merely that it should be possible to get more blood to the lungs, \\"as a plumber changes pipes around.\\" Although Taussig was not aware of it at that time, Blalock and Thomas had already experimented with such an anastomosis, one that Blalock had conceived years earlier for a different purpose but which had the unanticipated effect of re-routing blood to the lungs. The operation involved the joining of the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery. After meeting with Taussig, the two men set about perfecting the operation in the animal lab, with Thomas performing the subclavian-to-pulmonary anastomosis alone in some 200 laboratory dogs, then adapting the instruments for the first human surgery from those used on the experimental animals and coaching Blalock through the first 100 operations on infants. Thomas' autobiographical account, corroborated by the participants in the early tetralogy operations (Denton Cooley and the late William P. Longmire, Jr., intern and resident respectively during the surgery) has led to the recent conclusion that Thomas' contribution, both experimentally and clinically, was so critical that he should have received credit for the procedure along with Blalock and Taussig. However, because of the racial prejudices of the time, and the academic custom which generally precluded mention of non-degreed lab assistants (Thomas had no formal education beyond high school), he did not receive the honor of having the shunt named after him. The 2004 HBO television movie Something the Lord Made, based on Washingtonian writer Katie McCabe's 1989 article of the same name, was made about his role in the historic Blue Baby surgery, as was the 2003 public television documentary Partners of the Heart.

It drew roots from many sources: the languages LISP and ALGOL 60, and theoretical ideas from Peter J. Landin. It used an incremental compiler, which gave it some of the flexibility of an interpreted language, including allowing new function definitions at run time and modification of function definitions while a program was running (both of which are features of dynamic compilation), without the overhead of an interpreted language. Description =Stack= POP-2's syntax was Algol- like, except that assignments were the other way round: instead of writing a := 3; one wrote 3 -> a; The reason for this was that the language had explicit notion of an operand stack; thus, the previous assignment could be written as two separate statements: 3; which evaluated the value 3 and left it on the stack, and -> a; which popped the top value off the stack and assigned it to the variable 'a'. Similarly, the function call f(x, y, z); could be written as x, y, z; f(); (commas and semicolons being largely interchangeable) or even x, y, z.f; or (x, y, z).f; Because of the stack-based paradigm, there was no need to distinguish between statements and expressions; thus, the two constructs if a > b then c -> e else d -> e close; and if a > b then c else d close -> e; were equivalent (note the use of \`close\`, as \`endif\` hadn't been invented yet). =Arrays and doublet functions= There were no special language constructs for creating arrays or record structures as they are commonly understood: instead, these were created with the aid of special builtin functions, e.g. newarray (for arrays that could contain any type of item) and newanyarray for creating restricted types of items. Thus, array element and record field accessors were simply special cases of a doublet function: this was a function that had another function attached as its updater, which was called on the receiving side of an assignment. Thus, if the variable \`a\` contained an array, then 3 -> a(4); was equivalent to updater(a)(3, 4); the builtin function \`updater\` returning the updater of the doublet. Of course, \`updater\` was itself a doublet and could be used to change the updater component of a doublet. =Functions= Variables could hold values of any type, including functions, which were first-class objects. Thus, the following constructs function max x y; if x > y then x else y close end; and vars max; lambda x y; if x > y then x else y close end -> max; were equivalent. An interesting operation on functions was partial application, (sometimes referred to as \\"currying\\"). In partial application some number of the rightmost arguments of the function (which would be the last ones placed on the stack before the function is involved) were frozen to given values, to produce a new function of fewer arguments, which is a closure of the original function. For instance, consider a function for computing general second- degree polynomials: function poly2 x a b c; a * x * x + b * x + c end; This could be bound, for instance as vars less1squared; poly2(% 1, -2, 1%) -> less1squared; such that the expression less1squared(3) applies the closure of poly2 with three arguments frozen, to the argument 3, returning the square of (3 - 1), which is 4. The application of the partially applied function causes the frozen values (in this case 1, -2, 1) to be added to whatever is already on the stack (in this case 3), after which the original function poly2 is invoked. It then uses the top four items on the stack, producing the same result as poly2(3, 1, -2, 1) i.e. 1*3*3 + (-2)*3 + 1 =Operator definition= In POP-2, it was possible to define new operations (operators in modern terms).POP-2 Reference Manual, page 217, and An Introduction to the Study of Programming Languages, by David William Barron, page 75 vars operation 3 +*; lambda x y; x * x + y * y end -> nonop +* The first line declares a new operation +* with precedence (priority) 3. The second line creates a function f(x,y)=x*x+y*y, and assigns it to the newly declared operation +*. History The original version of POP-2 was implemented on an Elliott 4130 computer in the University of Edinburgh (with only 64KB RAM, doubled to 128KB in 1972). In the mid-1970s, POP-2 was ported to BESM-6 (POPLAN System). Later versions were implemented for CTL Modular One, PDP-10, ICL 1900 series (running the George operating system). Julian Davies, in Edinburgh, implemented an extended version of POP-2, which he called POP-10 on the PDP-10 computer running TOPS-10. This was the first dialect of POP-2 that treated case as significant in identifier names, used lower case for most system identifiers, and supported long identifiers with more than 8 characters. Shortly after that, a new implementation known as WPOP (for WonderPop) was implemented by Robert Rae and Allan Ramsay in Edinburgh, on a research-council funded project. That version introduced caged address spaces, some compile-time syntactic typing (e.g. for integers and reals) as well as some pattern matching constructs for use with a variety of data-structures. In parallel with that Steve Hardy at Sussex University implemented a subset of POP-2, which he called POP-11 which ran on a DEC PDP-11/40 computer. It was originally designed to run on the DEC operating system RSX-11D, in time-shared mode for teaching, but that caused so many problems that an early version of Unix was installed and used instead. That version of Pop-11 was written in Unix assembler, and code was incrementally compiled to an intermediate byte code which was interpreted. That port was completed around 1976 and as a result Pop-11 was used in several places for teaching. In order to support its teaching function many of the syntactic features of POP-2 were modified, e.g. replacing function ... end with define ... enddefine and adding a wider variety of looping constructs with closing brackets to match their opening brackets instead of the use of close for all loops in POP-2. Pop-11 also introduced a pattern matcher for list structures, making it much easier to teach AI programming. Around 1980 Pop-11 was ported to a VAX-11/780 computer by Steve Hardy and John Gibson, and soon after that it was replaced by a full incremental compiler (producing machine-code instead of an interpreted intermediate code). The existence of the compiler and all its subroutines at run time made it possible to support far richer language extensions than were possible with Macros, and as a result Pop-11 was used (by Steve Hardy, Chris Mellish and John Gibson)) to produce an implementation of Prolog, using the standard syntax of Prolog, and the combined system became known as Poplog, to which Common Lisp and Standard ML were later added. This version was later ported to a variety of machines and operating systems and as a result Pop-11 became the dominant dialect of POP-2, still available in the Poplog system. Around 1986 a new AI company Cognitive Applications Ltd., collaborated with members of Sussex university to produce a variant of Pop-11 called AlphaPop running on Apple Mac computers, with integrated graphics. This was used for a number of commercial projects, as well as being used for teaching AI programming in several universities. The fact that it was implemented in an early dialect of C, using an idiosyncratic compiler made it very hard to maintain and upgrade to new versions of the Mac operating system. In addition to this, AlphaPop was not \\"32-bit clean\\" due to the use of high address bits as \\"tag bits\\" to signify the type of objects, which was incompatible with the use of memory above 8Mb on later Macintoshes.

Development and design The Heinkel He 60 was designed by Heinkel engineer Reinhold Mewes, the designer of the He 59.Donald 1994, p.97. The resulting design was a single-engined biplane of mixed wood and metal construction with fabric covering. Its single bay wings were of equal-span and had significant stagger.Smith and Kay 1972, p.229. The first prototype flew early in 1933 and proved to be underpowered with its 492 kW (660 hp) BMW VI engine. The second prototype had a more powerful version of the BMW engine, but this only marginally improved its performance and was unreliable, so production aircraft reverted to the original engine.Green 1962, p.71 Of conventional configuration, the He 60 was a sturdy aircraft, designed (as the specification required) to be capable of operating on the open sea. As a result, it was always somewhat underpowered for its weight, which made handling sluggish and the aircraft vulnerable to enemy fire. Attempts were made to solve its lack of power by fitting one aircraft with a Daimler-Benz DB 600 engine, but engines were not available for production.Green 1962, p.72. Operational history German light cruiser K√∂ln Initial deliveries of the He 60 were to Kriegsmarine training units in June 1933. From 1934, the major production version, the He 60C began to be delivered to the shipboard observation seaplane units of the Kriegsmarine, operating from the catapults of all German cruisers. It also saw action with Spanish Nationalist forces during the Civil War. In 1939 it was replaced as a shipboard aircraft first by the He 114 in service, then soon after by the Arado Ar 196, but it remained in service with several coast reconnaissance Staffeln (squadrons) when World War II began.Smith and Kay 1972, p.231. It had been withdrawn from front-line service by 1940, but returned to use following Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, being used for coastal patrol work in the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas. All He 60s were removed from service by October 1943.

It featured challenges to the chess ideas of central European masters, including Wilhelm Steinitz's approach to the and the rules established by Siegbert Tarrasch. Overview The Hypermoderns demonstrated their new ideas with games and victories. Aron Nimzowitsch, considered the founder and leading practitioner of hypermodernism, showed that games could be won through indirect control of the centre, breaking with Tarrasch's view that the centre must be occupied by pawns. Nimzowitsch advocated controlling the centre with distant pieces rather than with pawns, thus inviting the opponent to occupy the centre with pawns, which can then become targets of attack. This was part of the hypermodern framework, which Nimzowitsch encapsulated in his seminal book My System, which greatly influenced many chess players. It introduced and formalised concepts of the , , undermining, prophylaxis, restraint, rook on the seventh , knight outposts, the dynamics of the isolated queen's pawn, and other areas of chess. Although none of the primary exponents of the Hypermodern school ever achieved the title of World Chess Champion, they were among the world's strongest players. World Champion Alexander Alekhine was associated with hypermodernism, but his style was more of a blend with the Classical school. In practice, hypermodernism has not replaced the classical theory of Steinitz and Tarrasch. Instead, modern chess textbooks describe hypermodernism as an addition, or extension, to classical theory. Hypermodern openings include the R√©ti Opening, King's Indian Defence, Queen's Indian Defence, Nimzo-Indian Defence, Nimzowitsch Defence, Gr√ºnfeld Defence, Bogo- Indian Defence, Old Indian Defence, Catalan Opening, King's Indian Attack, Alekhine's Defence, Modern Defence, Pirc Defence, Larsen's Opening, and to a lesser degree the English Opening. Openings such as 1.a3 do not constitute hypermodern openings since, although they delay the occupation of the centre with pawns, they also delay piece . History Howard Staunton and many of his 19th-century contemporaries understood various ideas associated with hypermodernism. The Hypermodern school of chess theory came to prominence in the 1920s. Leading members were Aron Nimzowitsch, Richard R√©ti, Savielly Tartakower, Gyula Breyer, Efim Bogoljubov, and Ernst Gr√ºnfeld, who all came from Central Europe. They felt that chess was becoming boring, slow, and not worthwhile. They also believed that chess could not be defined by a simple set of laws or principles, such as those laid out by Tarrasch. Their ideas were thus a challenge to the existing orthodoxy popularised by Siegbert Tarrasch in the 1890s. This orthodoxy was a rather dogmatic distillation of the ideas worked out by chess pioneer Wilhelm Steinitz. Steinitz was the first player who in his play demonstrated a mastery of , and the ideas he developed came to be known as the \\"Classical\\" or \\"Modern\\" school of thought. This school of thought emphasised the importance of \\"static\\" advantages such as avoidance of pawn weaknesses, strong outposts for knights, and striving for \\"good\\" rather than \\"bad\\" bishops in positions with locked pawn structures. This school of thought was in turn a reaction to the earlier swashbuckling style of Adolf Anderssen, Henry Blackburne, and others, who represented the Romantic school. In 1922, R√©ti published Die neuen Ideen im Schachspiel (English: The New Ideas in Chess), an examination of the evolution of chess thinking from the time of Paul Morphy through the beginning of the Hypermodern school. The name \\"hypermodern\\" was originated by Tartakower; his book Die hypermoderne Schachpartie (English: The Hypermodern Chess Game) was published in 1924. Nimzowitsch's book Mein System (English: My System) was published in 1925 through to 1927 in five installments. It discusses elements of hypermodernism, but focuses mainly on positional chess.

Attributes can include shapes, colors, ratios, and even time. Unlike postmodernism and modernism, hypermodernism exists in an era of fault-tolerant technological change and treats extraneous attributes (most conspicuously physical form) as discordant with function. While modernism and post-modernism debate the value of the \\"box\\" or absolute reference point, hypermodernism focuses on improvising attributes of the box (reference point now an extraneous value rather than correct or incorrect value) so that all of its attributes are non-extraneous; it also excises attributes that are extraneous. Hypermodernism is not a debate over truth or untruth as per modernism/postmodernism; rather it is a debate over what is and is not an extraneous attribute. Synchrony between previously-clashing objects (now attributes) and amorphous self-identity coupled with allusions to a magical existence acknowledge the movement. Some theorists view hypermodernism as a form of resistance to traditional modernism; others as a supersedence of it. Relationship to modernism and postmodernism Post-modernism and modernism debated each another in an industrial/physical context and were concerned with the social value of objects themselves. Modernism focused on confining form within the limited function of a 1950s object while 1970's postmodernism focused on freeing form from its limited function (\\"there-is-no- box\\"). The modern/postmodern oversight of objects as a mediator between attribute and function led to redundant human-context thinking and false conflicts between objects such as ideas. Propelled by technological advances Technology has played a definitive role in function catching up to attribute. An example is the touch-screen in which the attribute on the screen (ratio, shape, color, animation) becomes the focus of interaction as opposed to manipulation by an external tool i.e. cellphone keyboard. In the long-term the object ceases to become the middleman between attribute (form) and function. Non-composability of objects Hypermodernism holds that an object is by definition non-composable toward its attributes; and no one attribute of an object can act as a proxy for the object itself. No whole, or object, is reducible to ONLY its attributes; and the attributes may not be mutually exclusive to the object itself. Furthermore, an object may have extraneous functions independent of its composing attributes (postmodern theory); this potential supra-functionality is a key concern to hypermodernism's attempt to replace objects with attributes. Attributes, while having the functions of an object, are not building blocks toward an object in hypermodernism. No object is by definition hypermodern; however, an object can be more hypermodern or less hypermodern than another object. 2D aesthetic attributes projected as a 3D object. Long-term effects Hypermodernism displays a deep bias against objects physical and non-physical. It can be described as anti-object; however it is not anti-materialistic. Objects are viewed as an extraneous mediator between attribute and function. Over time, hypermodernism employs attributes to perform the functions of objects, and only those extant objects that can adequately convey the properties of its attributes are allowed to survive. Those objects that are irreducible to complete attributes will disappear as in the case of the physical keyboard. Over time, the attribute-function relationship becomes synonymous. Human psychology Hypermodernism compensates for the tendency of human thought to extract the attributes of an object and assign those same attributes to the functions of the object. Rather than focusing on a debate over \\"truth\\" or non-truth and other high-context social considerations, hypermodernism focuses on questions of extraneous vs non-extraneous (In design terms, correctness and incorrectness). Hypermodernism emphasizes correctness over completeness in design in order to guard against human intuitive leaps.

Cassell, 2005. They consisted of several independent seasonal nomadic groups who shared the same language and much of the same culture. The tribe included the groups called the Cujanes, Cocos, Guapites (Coapites), and Copanes.Wolff, Thomas. \\"The Karankawa Indians: Their Conflict with the White Man in Texas.\\" Ethnohistory 16, no. 1 (1969): 1-32. doi:10.2307/480941. Some of the village names survived to modern day and are the Ebahamo, Emet, Kouyam, Meracouman, Quara, Quinet, and the Toyal villages. From the onset of European colonization, the Karankawa had violent encounters with the Spanish. After one attack by the Spanish, who ambushed the Karankawa after the establishment of Presidio La Bah√≠a in 1722, the Karankawa allegedly felt \\"deeply betrayed [and] viewed Spanish colonial settlement with hostility.\\" By 1825, Stephen Austin commissioned a captain to lead volunteers to expel the Karankawa from the Austin land grant.Gatschet, Albert Samuel, Charles Adrian Hammond, and Alice Williams Oliver. The Karankawa Indians : The Coast People of Texas. Archaeological and Ethnological Papers of the Peabody Museum ; v. 1, No. 2. Cambridge, Mass.: Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnology, 1891. The Karankawa were repeatedly attacked by Texan colonists, commanded by men like John H. Moore and Robert Kuykendoll, who massacred men, women, and children in stealthy attacks on their villages to drive them out of their homelands, scalping the dead while stealing their food and supplies. By the 1840s, the Karankawa, now exiled, split into two groups, one of which settled on Padre Island while the other fled into the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. During 1858, Juan Nepomuceno Cortina led a group of Texan colonists against the Karankawa's last refuge and killed the remaining members of the tribe. By 1891, colonists believed the Karankawa as an organized tribe had been disbanded. Historical research of the Karankawa is hindered because the documents concerning them were overwhelmingly written by enemies of the tribe.Geneser, Vivien L. \\"Native transgressions: a look at the portrayal of Karankawa natives in Texas history textbooks and trade books.\\" American Educational History Journal 38, no. 1-2 (2011): 219+.

The Karankawa have been described for centuries as \\"cannibals,\\" now believed by many to be a falsehood initially perpetuated by the Spanish after they failed to convert them to Catholicism at missionary settlements in La Bah√≠a and Refugio. Years later, Texan colonist John H. Moore attempted to justify his role in the massacres of the Karankawa because \\"their cannibalism... [was] beyond question,\\" despite the total absence of evidence.  Name  The Karankawa name's origin is from the caves of El Paso. People worship it still today. Landar, Herbert. \\"The Karankawa Invasion of Texas.\\" International Journal of American Linguistics 34, no. 4 (1968): 242-58. http://www.jstor.org/stable/1264198. Early speculation involved the names that neighboring tribes had for the Karankawa. The name Karankawa was theorized to originate from related peoples living nearby who called the dog the term \\"klam\\" or \\"glam\\", and to love, to like, to be fond of, \\"kawa.\\" Thus Karankawa could mean dog-lovers or dog-raisers. Meanwhile, the Tonkawa called them Wrestlers (\\"Keles\\" or \\"Killis\\"), due to the Karankawas' skill in the art. They alternatively called them the barefooted or those without moccasins (\\"Yakokon kapa-i\\"), but this name was also applied to other groups with which the Tonkawe were acquainted. The Lipan-Apache called the Karankawa the people who walk in the water (\\"Nda Kun dadehe\\"), possibly referring to their mode of fishing and catching turtles, or simply their location near the swampy coast. Notably, the Karankawa called themselves \\"Karankawa\\" as well. Later speculation placed the Karankawa language in the Cariban linguistic stock. Linguistic data suggests that the Karankawa name originated from the old Spanish Main, \\"Kalina,\\" and a suffix from a Northern Carib tribe, \\"kxura,\\"meaning \\"people;\\" a compound emerges: Karinxkxura, meaning \\"Carib people.\\" But this theory is disputed and ultimately, the origins of the name \\"Karankawa\\" remain unknown.  Origins  According to some contemporary sources, the migrations of their ancestors were entirely unknown to the Karankawa of the early nineteenth century. However, the linguist Herbert Landar argues that based on linguistic evidence, the Karankawa language and people originated from a Carib subgroup. The Carib subgroup to which the Karankawa people belong remains to be discovered. Their exact migratory path northward is equally indistinct. Migration northward is theorized to have occurred during the late fifteenth century. The route north was from the original land north of the Amazon river toward Tamaulipas and Texas, and was probably done over a long period of time by short bursts of migration. Scholars have speculated that the Karankawa were descended from a group of Carib Indians who arrived by sea from the Caribbean basin. This is partially based on the similarity of their physical appearance to Caribbean natives. However, no ethnographic or archaeological evidence has been found for this speculation.Rickliss, Robert. The Karankawa Indians of Texas: An Ecological Study of Cultural Tradition and Change, University of Texas Press. Austin: 1996. p. vii Recent archaeological records that used radiocarbon dating for artifacts indicated that these native groups had been in the area as early as the 5th- millennium BCE.  Lifestyle  = Seasonal nomadic lifestyle = The Karankawa voyaged from place to place on a seasonal basis in their dugouts, made from large trees with the bark left intact. They travelled in groups of thirty to forty people and remained in each place for about four weeks. After European contact, canoes were of two kinds, both being called \\"awa'n\\": the original dugout and old skiffs obtained from the whites. Neither were used for fishing but for transportation only, and their travels were limited to the waters close to the land. The women, children, and possessions travelled in the hold while the men stood on the stern and poled the canoe. Upon landing at their next destination, the women set up wigwams (called ba'ak in their native language) and the men hauled the boats on the shore. Their campsites were always close to the shoreline of the nearby body of water. Their wigwams consisted of willow branches arranged in a circle, with the tops of the branches bent toward the center and interlocked in wickerwork. This wickerwork was fastened with deerskin. Upon this framework, the Karankawa lay deer, wildcat, panther or bear skins, again fastened with deerskin thongs. The next step was to make a fire. After European contact, the Karankawa begged for matches or tinderboxes from settlers; otherwise, they resorted to the traditional method of using their firesticks, which they always carried in a package of deerthongs. The fire was always made in the center of their dwellings and kept burning day and night. They used animal skins to sit and sleep on within their dwellings. Their household goods and utensils included wooden spoons, some clay vessels, fishbone needles, and fine deer sinew. = Methods of hunting and gathering = The primary food sources of the Karankawa were deers, rabbits, birds, fishes, oysters, shellfish, and turtles. They supplemented their hunting with gathering food such as berries, persimmons, wild grapes, sea-bird eggs, prickly pear cacti, and nuts. Their food was always boiled in earthen pots or roasted. Although there were a lot of salt deposits nearby, the Karankawa used chile for seasoning their food. After European contact, the Karankawa also would mix flour with water, lay the dough upon a flat stone, and baked it on the open fire. They were fond of sweet coffee. The Karankawa seemed to manage to always get pure, freshwater, although the whites did not know where they obtained it, because the wells of the whites had a brackish taste.  Culture  = Language = The Karankawa spoken language was observed to be deeply guttural. Syllabic structure was vocalic, they doubled consonants and vowels, and often extended sentences beyond the supply of breath which they could command. They often abbreviated their words and spoke softly. They also possessed a gesture language for conversing with people from other Native American tribes.  Smoke signalling  The Karankawa were noted for their skill of communicating with each other over long distances using smoke. The Karankawa could make the smoke of a small fire ascend toward the sky in many different ways, and it was as intelligible to them across long distances as their language. Their methods are unknown. = Manners and customs = The Karankawa had a specific way of conversing. They carefully repressed their breath while speaking; at the end of their sentences, they exhaled heavily, releasing the air they held back during speaking. Moreover, their expression was interpreted by Europeans as impassive, especially because they never looked at the person to whom they were speaking. Their pronunciation was very exact, and they ridiculed poor elocution by the whites who tried to learn their language. The Europeans described their general demeanor as surly and fatigued. They did not have a regular sleep schedule, but slept whenever they wished. They also ate and drank at all times of the day. Karankawa never communicated their native names to the whites. However, they all adopted English or Spanish names. Many men adopted American military epithets and Christian names, and they would change these frequently. Among the Karankawa there exists an in-law taboo. Once a man and his wife have become in the Karankawa sense, married, the husband and his children are now no longer allowed to enter the residence of his wife's parents nor can his wife's parents enter his or his children's home. These two groups are also no longer allowed to talk with one another and must never come face to face with one another. If there is the danger of coming face to face with one another both parties must avert their eyes and move away from each other. This taboo only seems to apply to the husbands and their children, most likely due to inconvenience on the wife's part as Karankawans are typically patrilocal. = Arts, athletics, and recreation = The Karankawa possessed at least three musical instruments: a large gourd filled with stones which was shaken to produce sound, a fluted piece of wood which the Karankawa drew a stick over to produce sound, and a flute which was softly blown. The Karankawa practiced hatchet-throwing, recreational brawls with knives, ball plays, and wrestling matches. No gambling or guessing games seemed to have developed among the Karankawa. The Karankawa were also noted for their remarkable physical feats, such as continuing to fight after being wounded in battle, breaking ice with their bodies, and swimming in freezing water.  Archery  Their skill most notable was that of archery. The Karankawa made their own bows and arrows, and were renowned for great skill whether standing on land, in calm waters, or in turbulent waters. Their bows were made of red cedar wood and they made them according to the height of each archer, reaching from the foot to the chin or eye. The bows were always kept in perfect repair. The arrows were about a yard long, tipped with steel and feathered with wild geese feathers. As well as using archery for hunting, the Karankawa engaged in archery as a recreational activity. They often shot at the mark or shot arrows perpendicularly into space. The shooting matches they held were lively and sportive. Many young men were able to split the previous arrow in the target in two from a distance of at least eighty feet. = Social institutions =  Tribal leadership  The groups of Karankawa were commonly led by two chiefs: a civil government chief with a hereditary succession in the male lines, and a war-chief, probably appointed by the civil government chief. No evidence of a confederacy, like that of the Caddo or Creeks, was found. The Karankawa were probably a loose-knit body living under separate chiefs only united by the common language and shared war expeditions. The ritual in order to become a chief has been studied by 18th-century Spaniards. They have stated that a selection starts from many candidates and each is injured by a comb created from the spines of a sea fish, long wounds being dug into their skin from the top of their head to the soles of their feet and then tied to a pole for several days to either emerge thin or emaciated and close to death. While this description can indeed be a ritual to choose a chief, a diary of Fray Gaspar Jose De Solis states that he suspects these rituals could simply be a puberty rite or an initiation ritual to a brotherhood.  Gender and family structures  One aspect of the Karankawa culture was their recognition of three gender roles: male, female, and a third role taken on by some males and women. Males who took on this third role are called berdache (Karankawa: monanguia.) They generally took on female roles and activities in daily life, while playing a special role in religious rites. According to some accounts, the berdache also performed as passive sexual partners for other males. In the written accounts of √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca it is mentioned that bride price and bride service is part of a Karankawa marriage. While the bride price is assumed to be the generalized system in the indigenous population found by Cabeza de Vaca where the groom gives gift to the parents of the girl he wishes to marry in order to secure their permission, the bride service is based on a ritual where the husband must give every morsel of food he managed to collect or hunt to his wife. His wife then delivers the bounty to her parents and in return is gifted food to give back to her husband. This ritual goes on for an unknown number of months, but when it is concluded the pair typically then engage in patrilocal residence. In terms of marriage, divorce is a common aspect typically only to marriages that have not created any children and is unlikely if children have been born from the marriage. Between the husband and wife, no signs of fondness, intimacy, or special treatment were observed. The Karankawa reacted strongly and sometimes violently to Europeans interfering in marital or familial affairs. The Karankawa were said to have great compassion and tenderness for their children. Children not able to walk yet were carried by the mother on the back, wrapped in a loop of skin. = Appearance =  Physical character  Many Europeans noted the sharp contrasts in appearance between Karankawa men and women. The women were described as plainer, shorter and of stouter build than the men. The men were very tall, of strong athletic build, and had coarse black hair. Most men wore their hair so long as to the waist. Their foreheads were mostly low and broad, and the heads larger than most whites. The men, in contrast with the women, had lithe builds and slender hands and feet. Their skin color was said to be lighter and closer to cinammon-colored than the women. Both men and women were noted for their spectacularly white teeth, even elders.  Dress and ornamentation  Forehead flattening was practiced for all Karankawa. As babies, a piece of cloth was applied first, then a thin board, and then a wadded cloth. Each of these tied to the head with a bandage and left to stay there about one year. The men wore a breech-clout of skins, while the women wore skirts of deerskin. Neither head-covers nor shoes were ever worn by the Karankawa. Some women of the tribe obtained European clothing occasionally, but would only tear them apart or wear them temporarily. European blankets were of greater use to the tribe, worn fastened to their bodies during cold weather and pinned with thorns. Both men and women wore a small bracelet of undressed deer skin. The children were left to roam undressed until they were about ten years old. The Karankawa had distinctive tattoos, notably: a blue circle tattooed over each cheekbone, one horizontal blue line from the outer angle of the eye toward the ear, three perpendicular parallel lines on the chin from the middle of the lower lip downward, and two other lines extending down from under each corner of the mouth. Moreover, they were observed by sixteenth century explorers to have piercings of cane on the lower lips, nose, and other parts of the body.Trigger, Bruce G, and Washburn, Wilcomb E. \\"The Greater Southwest and California from the Beginning of European Settlement to the 1880s.\\" In The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas, 57-116. Vol. 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996. The woman in some tribes such as the Coco group also had a tattoo of concentric black circles from their nipple to circling their entire breast. Men, women, and children alike rubbed sharks' oil on their entire bodies regularly to deter mosquitoes effectively and to keep their skin soft and supple. Europeans who encountered the Karankawa were disgusted by the odor. The women wore no ornaments, while the men were seen with many ornaments. Men's long hair was braided and consisted of three strands. They inserted bright objects (e..g, ribbons, colored flannel). The women never braided their hair nor combed it regularly. The men wore necklaces of small shells, glass beads, pistachios, and thin metal disks on their throats (never on their chests). Rings were also worn by the men. = Religion and ritual = Europeans knew limited information about the rituals of the Karankawa because the latter did not reveal the purposes of their actions or their beliefs. When Joutel, an explorer and companion of Robert Cavalier de La Salle, questioned their religious beliefs, the Karankawa only pointed at the sky. At the full moon and after very successful hunting or fishing expeditions, the Karankawa traditionally held a ceremonial. After gathering around a central fire, they boiled a strong and bitter brew from the leaves of the yaupon tree and stirred it until the top was covered with a yellowish froth. This brew was shared and all the Karankawa drank freely. Although this brew was said to be intoxicating, Europeans did not notice any visible effects on the natives. One Native stood within the circle of men, wrapped up to his head in skins, and he bent over as he walked circled the fire. They chanted in chromatic ascending and descending tones, and all the Natives joined in the chorus. This ceremony would continue throughout the night. Other than this, only a few other rituals were observed, and their purposes are unknown. The Karankawa would stare at the sun when it disappeared into the sea, like some other native groups of the area. They would also smoke tobacco through their nostrils first to the north, then to the east, west, and south. They frequently whistled at certain times and apparently for some objective, but ultimately for unknown purposes. Portrait of √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca. In regards to special burial rites or rituals, the Karankawa seemed to be indifferent, and buried their dead at the site of their passing.  Cannibalism  According to some sources, the Karankawa practiced ritual cannibalism, in common with other Gulf coastal tribes of present-day Texas and Louisiana.\\"Karankawa Indian Tribe History.\\" Access Genealogy. √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca, a Spanish conquistador who lived among the Karankawa for several years in the 1530 and wrote a memoir, made no mention of cannibalism except for ritualistic consumption of deceased relatives in the form of funeral ashes \\"presented in water for the relatives to drink.\\" Cabeza De Vaca admitted that he and his fellow survivors had committed acts of cannibalism of their own, eating their dead in order to survive after shipwrecking off Galveston Bay. The Karankawa people were shocked at the Spanish cannibalism, which they found to be repugnant. Whites never actually witnessed an act of cannibalism, and second and third-hand accounts are of disputed credibility. = Dogs = The Karankawa was distinctive in that they were one of the only tribes known to keep dogs. The Karankawan dogs, of a coyote-like or wolf-like species, accompanied the Karankawa on hunts, swims, and recreational activities. The dogs were voiceless, with straight ears and fox-like snouts.  History  =Early encounters with the Spanish and French (16th - 17th centuries)= Jamaica Beach on the west end of Galveston Island In 1528, one of two barges put together by survivors of the failed P√°nfilo de Narv√°ez expedition to Florida struck aground at Galveston Island. Survivors, including Cabeza de Vaca, were cared for by the Capoque band of Karankawa. From 1527, Cabeza de Vaca subsisted for seven years among the coastal tribes, making a living as a medical practitioner and occasional trader. During his stay, de Vaca reported that a fatal stomach ailment reduced the Karankawa population by roughly one half; the nature and casualties resulting from this illness are unknown.Trigger, Bruce G, and Washburn, Wilcomb E. \\"Entertaining Strangers: North America in the Sixteenth Century.\\" In The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas, 325-98. Vol. 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996. De Vaca reported that extensive trade occurred with inland groups as far as the extent of the entire length of the present-day United States. After the introduction of the horse by Spaniards, these trade networks strengthened. Henri Joutel, the companion of Robert Cavelier de La Salle on his last expedition in 1687, recorded several tribes living in the coastal area, including the Karankawa (which he spelled as Korenkake and Koinekahe). His observations were that the Karankawa were peaceable rather than hostile. Upon their first meeting, Joutel reports that the Karankawa \\"demonstrated their friendship by putting their hands over their hearts, which meant that they were glad to see us.\\" He also noted that they possessed horses, which were undoubtedly obtained from the Spanish. When de La Salle stole some canoes from the Karankawa to sail up a river and establish Fort St. Louis, the Karankawas were enraged. When they heard of de La Salle's departure and subsequent death, they attacked about twenty French settlers left in the fort and massacred all but five. The survivors were forcibly tattooed and made to follow the Karankawa on their hunting and fishing expeditions; they were eventually rescued by a Spanish expedition in 1689. = Relations with the Spanish = The La Salle venture stimulated the Spanish into active exploration and colonization of south Texas. A Spanish search for Fort St. Louis to check if the French had returned led to a skirmish between the Karankawa and the Spanish, and an establishment of hostilities between these two groups. In 1691, Captain Domingo Teran led a combined land-sea expedition to Texas to strengthen recently established missions and to search for French presence. Both expeditions were mismanaged and led to a temporary lapse in Spanish interest. However, continued French action encouraged the Spaniards to occupy the area of Matagorda Bay permanently. La Bah√≠a del Espiritu Santo, a mission-presidio complex, was established in 1722 on the southern bank of the San Antonio river. At first, the Karankawa were not antagonistic to the Spanish. But in 1723, a skirmish occurred between the Spanish and Karankawa, after which the Karankawa moved away from the mission and became hostile. By 1727, the Karankawa depredations forced the mission-presidio complex to move inland to the Guadalupe river, where they remained until 1749. The Karankawa successfully reduced Spanish claim to the Texas coast. By the 1730s, the Karankawa and other native tribes of the Texas area were viewed by the Spanish as the primary obstacle to control of northern New Spain. In 1749, Jose Escandon was made governor and representative of the viceroy, appointed to conquer and settle northern Mexico and the region of Texas and to map, survey, and acquaint himself with the area and with the natives. He recommended that the mission of La Bah√≠a should be moved because of native hostility and the unfavorable climate. A new mission, Mission Rosario, was established in 1754. It was in constant fear of revolt by the natives in the mission and often appealed to La Bah√≠a for military aid. Overall, it was extremely ineffective as a spiritual and \\"civilizing\\" center. The Karankawa fled when subjected to any corporal punishment, and continued to enjoy the resources provided by the Spanish without being dependent on them. Over time, the Karankawa grew to speak Spanish with great fluency and adopted Spanish names for themselves to facilitate interaction with the whites. The late eighteenth century saw a revival of Karankawa resistance and strength. The Spanish began to see them as unable to be converted to mission life, and some began to scheme for their extermination. However, none of these schemes were carried out. In 1806, the Rosario mission was merged with that of Refugio. In 1830, Refugio and La Bah√≠a del Espiritu Santo were secularized. = Relations with the English and the French = While the Spanish tried to incorporate the Karankawa into their empire, the Karankawa engaged in purely economic terms with the English and the French, trading skins and deer for weapons (i.e., muskets, guns) and household goods. =Encounters with Jean Lafitte= When Galveston Island was occupied by the pirate Jean Lafitte from 1817 to 1821, some of his men kidnapped a Karankawa woman. In response, about three hundred Karankawa moved in to attack. When Lafitte learned of their encampment and impending attack, he sent two hundred of his men, armed with two cannons to confront the Karankawa. After the Karankawa lost about thirty men, they retreated to the mainland, with the pirates in pursuit. On the mainland, a few more Karankawa were killed. = Encounters with the Texan colonists= Austin was introduced to the Karankawas via an encounter with a peaceful Coco tribe. After some talks and an exchange of tobacco and a frying pan, Moses Austin considered them good friends, but after a warning of Karankawas at the mouth of a nearby river, Moses wrote in his journal that Karankawas are universal enemies of man and cannot be befriended and must be removed in order for Anglo-American settlers to live in peace. Painting, \\"The Settlement of Austin's Colony,\\" by Henry Arthur McArdle, in the House of Representatives chamber in the Texas Capitol. Stephen F. Austin is shown rallying his colonists against the Karankawa Indians around 1824, as an unnamed scout comes to the cabin door to sound the alarm. In 1821, Moses Austin received the Austin land grant to settle 300 families between Galveston Bay and the Colorado River. The Karankawa sought to hinder their progress by killing settlers who were guarding the ship John Motley and by stealing their supplies. By 1825, settlers banded together to attack the Karankawa. Stephen Austin commissioned Captain Kuykendall to lead volunteers to expel them from the territory, which extended to the Lavaca river. They chased the Karankawa to Manahila Creek, where a Spanish missionary interceded on their behalf and made them promise to never again go east of the Lavaca. This promise was broken, however, and was met by disproportionate violence by the Texan colonists. = Genocide of the Karankawa community = During the Texan-Mexican war, some of the Karankawa served in the Mexican Army. They suffered greatly in the Battle of the Alamo of 1836, and the Texans retaliated heavily for their service. Chief Jose Maria's 19-year-old son, Walupe, was captured by the Mexicans and killed. His father came on board the ship of a Texan settler and announced his intent of revenge. However, he and the majority of his men were killed. Antonio, who claimed he was the brother of Jose Maria, became chief after that. During his administration and afterward, the Karankawa population diminished significantly from disease, conflict with Europeans and infighting. By the 1840s, the Karankawa consisted of two groups: one settled on Padre Island, while the other applied to settle in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. After being exiled from their homeland, the latter group reportedly plundered and stole; the Mexican government subsequently ordered troops to subdue them. General Avalos was ordered to move the Karankawa to the border of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le√≥n. The two states disputed over the Karankawa, and they were eventually returned to Reynosa. After continued robberies, the Karankawa were removed to Texas. In 1858, the judge of Rosario, Mexico, sent a message to the mayor of Reynosa that he had tried to arrest the Karankawa but they moved north of the American border beyond his jurisdiction. He added that Mexicans and Americans should work together for the Karankawas' arrest. Later that year, Juan Cortina made a surprise attack on the recently returned Karankawa and annihilated the last members of the tribe. In a study on the Karankawa published in 1888, one interviewee \\"thought that some [Karankawa] may be still in existence, but could not tell where.\\" Environment The Karankawa traveled to the mountains and basins region. They hunted and gathered food from rivers and by the mountains. In the region that the Karankawa inhabited, numerous small chunks of asphaltum have been found along the coast from oil seepage beneath the Gulf of Mexico. These chunks were used to bind arrowheads to their shafts; as a coating for pottery such as ollas, jars, and bowls; and as a way to waterproof woven baskets. Notes References   * External links * E.

The term is used within a number of technical disciplines, notably radar. In radar, a radio signal of a particular carrier frequency is turned on and off; the term \\"frequency\\" refers to the carrier, while the PRF refers to the number of switches. Both are measured in terms of cycle per second, or hertz. The PRF is normally much lower than the frequency. For instance, a typical World War II radar like the Type 7 GCI radar had a basic carrier frequency of 209 MHz (209 million cycles per second) and a PRF of 300 or 500 pulses per second. A related measure is the pulse width, the amount of time the transmitter is turned on during each pulse. The PRF is one of the defining characteristics of a radar system, which normally consists of a powerful transmitter and sensitive receiver connected to the same antenna. After producing a brief pulse of radio signal, the transmitter is turned off in order for the receiver units to hear the reflections of that signal off distant targets. Since the radio signal has to travel out to the target and back again, the required inter-pulse quiet period is a function of the radar's desired range. Longer periods are required for longer range signals, requiring lower PRFs. Conversely, higher PRFs produce shorter maximum ranges, but broadcast more pulses, and thus radio energy, in a given time. This creates stronger reflections that make detection easier. Radar systems must balance these two competing requirements. Using older electronics, PRFs were generally fixed to a specific value, or might be switched among a limited set of possible values. This gives each radar system a characteristic PRF, which can be used in electronic warfare to identify the type or class of a particular platform such as a ship or aircraft, or in some cases, a particular unit. Radar warning receivers in aircraft include a library of common PRFs which can identify not only the type of radar, but in some cases the mode of operation. This allowed pilots to be warned when an SA-2 SAM battery had \\"locked on\\", for instance. Modern radar systems are generally able to smoothly change their PRF, pulse width and carrier frequency, making identification much more difficult. Sonar and lidar systems also have PRFs, as does any pulsed system. In the case of sonar, the term pulse repetition rate (PRR) is more common, although it refers to the same concept. Introduction Electromagnetic (e.g. radio or light) waves are conceptually pure single frequency phenomena while pulses may be mathematically thought of as composed of a number of pure frequencies that sum and nullify in interactions that create a pulse train of the specific amplitudes, PRRs, base frequencies, phase characteristics, et cetera (See Fourier Analysis). The first term (PRF) is more common in device technical literature (Electrical Engineering and some sciences), and the latter (PRR) more commonly used in military-aerospace terminology (especially United States armed forces terminologies) and equipment specifications such as training and technical manuals for radar and sonar systems. The reciprocal of PRF (or PRR) is called the pulse repetition time (PRT), pulse repetition interval (PRI), or inter-pulse period (IPP), which is the elapsed time from the beginning of one pulse to the beginning of the next pulse. The IPP term is normally used when referring to the quantity of PRT periods to be processed digitally. Each PRT having a fixed number of range gates, but not all of them being used. For example, the APY-1 radar used 128 IPP's with a fixed 50 range gates, producing 128 Doppler filters using an FFT. The different number of range gates on each of the five PRF's all being less than 50. Within radar technology PRF is important since it determines the maximum target range (Rmax) and maximum Doppler velocity (Vmax) that can be accurately determined by the radar. Conversely, a high PRR/PRF can enhance target discrimination of nearer objects, such as a periscope or fast moving missile. This leads to use of low PRRs for search radar, and very high PRFs for fire control radars. Many dual- purpose and navigation radars‚Äîespecially naval designs with variable PRRs‚Äîallow a skilled operator to adjust PRR to enhance and clarify the radar picture‚Äîfor example in bad sea states where wave action generates false returns, and in general for less clutter, or perhaps a better return signal off a prominent landscape feature (e.g., a cliff). Definition Pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is the number of times a pulsed activity occurs every second. This is similar to cycle per second used to describe other types of waveforms. PRF is inversely proportional to time period \\\\Tau which is the property of a pulsed wave. : \\\\Tau = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\text{PRF}} PRF is usually associated with pulse spacing, which is the distance that the pulse travels before the next pulse occurs. : \\\\text{Pulse Spacing} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Propagation Speed}}{\\\\text{PRF}} Physics PRF is crucial to perform measurements for certain physics phenomenon. For example, a tachometer may use a strobe light with an adjustable PRF to measure rotational velocity. The PRF for the strobe light is adjusted upward from a low value until the rotating object appears to stand still. The PRF of the tachometer would then match the speed of the rotating object. Other types of measurements involve distance using the delay time for reflected echo pulses from light, microwaves, and sound transmissions. Measurement PRF is crucial for systems and devices that measure distance. * Radar * Laser range finder * Sonar Different PRF allow systems to perform very different functions. A radar system uses a radio frequency electromagnetic signal reflected from a target to determine information about that target. PRF is required for radar operation. This is the rate at which transmitter pulses are sent into air or space. =Range ambiguity= A real target in 100 km or a second-sweep echo in a distance of 400 km A radar system determines range through the time delay between pulse transmission and reception by the relation: :\\\\text{Range} = \\\\frac{c\\\\tau}{2} For accurate range determination a pulse must be transmitted and reflected before the next pulse is transmitted. This gives rise to the maximum unambiguous range limit: :\\\\text{Max Range} = \\\\frac{c\\\\tau_\\\\text{PRT}}{2} = \\\\frac{c}{2\\\\,\\\\text{PRF}} \\\\qquad \\\\begin{cases} \\\\tau_\\\\text{PRT} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\text{PRF}} \\\\end{cases} The maximum range also defines a range ambiguity for all detected targets. Because of the periodic nature of pulsed radar systems, it is impossible for some radar system to determine the difference between targets separated by integer multiples of the maximum range using a single PRF. More sophisticated radar systems avoid this problem through the use of multiple PRFs either simultaneously on different frequencies or on a single frequency with a changing PRT. The range ambiguity resolution process is used to identify true range when PRF is above this limit. =Low PRF= Systems using PRF below 3 kHz are considered low PRF because direct range can be measured to a distance of at least 50 km. Radar systems using low PRF typically produce unambiguous range. Unambiguous Doppler processing becomes an increasing challenge due to coherency limitations as PRF falls below 3 kHz. For example, an L-Band radar with 500 Hz pulse rate produces ambiguous velocity above 75 m/s (170 mile/hour), while detecting true range up to 300 km. This combination is appropriate for civilian aircraft radar and weather radar. :\\\\text{300 km range} = \\\\frac{C}{2 \\\\times 500} :\\\\text{75 m/s velocity} = \\\\frac{500 \\\\times C}{2 \\\\times 10^9} Low PRF radar have reduced sensitivity in the presence of low-velocity clutter that interfere with aircraft detection near terrain. Moving target indicator is generally required for acceptable performance near terrain, but this introduces radar scalloping issues that complicate the receiver. Low PRF radar intended for aircraft and spacecraft detection are heavily degraded by weather phenomenon, which cannot be compensated using moving target indicator. =Medium PRF= Range and velocity can both be identified using medium PRF, but neither one can be identified directly. Medium PRF is from 3 kHz to 30 kHz, which corresponds with radar range from 5 km to 50 km. This is the ambiguous range, which is much smaller than the maximum range. Range ambiguity resolution is used to determine true range in medium PRF radar. Medium PRF is used with Pulse-Doppler radar, which is required for look-down/shoot-down capability in military systems. Doppler radar return is generally not ambiguous until velocity exceeds the speed of sound. A technique called ambiguity resolution is required to identify true range and speed. Doppler signals fall between 1.5 kHz, and 15 kHz, which is audible, so audio signals from medium-PRF radar systems can be used for passive target classification. For example, an L band radar system using a PRF of 10 kHz with a duty cycle of 3.3% can identify true range to a distance of 450 km (30 * C / 10,000 km/s). This is the instrumented range. Unambiguous velocity is 1,500 m/s (3,300 mile/hour). :\\\\text{450 km} = \\\\frac{C}{0.033 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 10,000} :\\\\text{1,500 m/s} = \\\\frac{10,000 \\\\times C}{2 \\\\times 10^9} The unambiguous velocity of an L-Band radar using a PRF of 10 kHz would be 1,500 m/s (3,300 mile/hour) (10,000 x C / (2 x 10^9)). True velocity can be found for objects moving under 45,000 m/s if the band pass filter admits the signal (1,500/0.033). Medium PRF has unique radar scalloping issues that require redundant detection schemes. =High PRF= Systems using PRF above 30 kHz function better known as interrupted continuous-wave (ICW) radar because direct velocity can be measured up to 4.5 km/s at L band, but range resolution becomes more difficult. High PRF is limited to systems that require close-in performance, like proximity fuses and law enforcement radar. For example, if 30 samples are taken during the quiescent phase between transmit pulses using a 30 kHz PRF, then true range can be determined to a maximum of 150 km using 1 microsecond samples (30 x C / 30,000 km/s). Reflectors beyond this range might be detectable, but the true range cannot be identified. :\\\\text{150 km} = \\\\frac{30 \\\\times C}{2 \\\\times 30,000} :\\\\text{4,500 m/s} = \\\\frac{30,000 \\\\times C}{2 \\\\times 10^9} It becomes increasingly difficult to take multiple samples between transmit pulses at these pulse frequencies, so range measurements are limited to short distances. =Sonar= Sonar systems operate much like radar, except that the medium is liquid or air, and the frequency of the signal is either audio or ultra-sonic. Like radar, lower frequencies propagate relatively higher energies longer distances with less resolving ability. Higher frequencies, which damp out faster, provide increased resolution of nearby objects. Signals propagate at the speed of sound in the medium (almost always water), and maximum PRF depends upon the size of the object being examined. For example, the speed of sound in water is 1,497 m/s, and the human body is about 0.5 m thick, so the PRF for ultrasound images of the human body should be less than about 2 kHz (1,497/0.5). As another example, ocean depth is approximately 2 km, so sound takes over a second to return from the sea floor. Sonar is a very slow technology with very low PRF for this reason. =Laser= Light waves can be used as radar frequencies, in which case the system is known as lidar. This is short for \\"LIght Detection And Ranging,\\" similar to the original meaning of the initialism \\"RADAR,\\" which was RAdio Detection And Ranging. Both have since become commonly-used english words, and are therefore acronyms rather than initialisms. Laser range or other light signal frequency range finders operate just like radar at much higher frequencies. Non-laser light detection is utilized extensively in automated machine control systems (e.g. electric eyes controlling a garage door, conveyor sorting gates, etc.), and those that use pulse rate detection and ranging are at heart, the same type of system as a radar--without the bells and whistles of the human interface. Unlike lower radio signal frequencies, light does not bend around the curve of the earth or reflect off the ionosphere like C-band search radar signals, and so lidar is useful only in line of sight applications like higher frequency radar systems.

Tasman was an attempt to improve support for web standards, as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium. At the time of its release, Tasman was seen as the layout engine with the best support for web standards such as HTML and CSS. Internet Explorer for Mac is no longer supported, but newer versions of Tasman are incorporated in some other Microsoft products. Tantek √áelik led the software team that developed the Tasman engine. Tasman later became used as the layout engine for the MSN for Mac OS X and Office 2004 for Mac.  Version history  The first version of Tasman (referred to as \\"v0\\") was released with Internet Explorer 5 Macintosh Edition on March 27, 2000. An upgraded version (version 0.1) followed on with the release of Internet Explorer 5.1 for Mac. On May 15, 2003, Microsoft released the subscription-only MSN for Mac OS X browser, which used an upgraded version of Tasman (version 0.9) as its layout engine. In a posting to the Mac Internet Explorer Talk list, Internet Explorer for Mac program manager Jimmy Grewal listed improvements: * Full Unicode support * Improved CSS support, with CSS 3 Selectors, CSS TV Profile and @media * Improved DOM support with DOM 1 Core and DOM 2 Core, Style, and Events. Also improved compatibility with Windows IE DOM. * XHTML 1.0 and 1.1 support, although it is not activated in MSN for Mac OS X. * Better support for Mac OS X features such as CoreGraphics, ATSUI and CFSocket networking. For a while Tasman was improved as part of a number of TV set-top box projects at Microsoft reaching version 1.0. The Tasman engine is now used in the Microsoft TV Mediaroom Edition. On May 11, 2004, Microsoft started shipping Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac which incorporates a version of the Tasman layout engine in its email client Entourage. Since Microsoft Office for Mac 2011, Entourage has been replaced by Macintosh version of Microsoft Outlook which uses a WebKit-based layout engine (used by Safari) instead.

For example, \\\\mbox{isqrt}(27) = 5 because 5\\\\cdot 5=25 \\\\le 27 and 6\\\\cdot 6=36 > 27. Algorithm using Newton's method One way of calculating \\\\sqrt{n} and \\\\mbox{isqrt}( n ) is to use Newton's method to find a solution for the equation x^{2} - n = 0, giving the iterative formula : {x}_{k+1} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(x_k + \\\\frac{ n }{x_k}\\\\right), \\\\quad k \\\\ge 0, \\\\quad x_0 > 0. The sequence \\\\\\\\{ x_k \\\\\\\\} converges quadratically to \\\\sqrt{n} as k\\\\to \\\\infty. It can be proven that if x_{0} = n is chosen as the initial guess, one can stop as soon as :x_{k+1}-x_{k}< 1 to ensure that \\\\lfloor x_{k+1} \\\\rfloor=\\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt n \\\\rfloor. =Using only integer division= For computing \\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt n \\\\rfloor for very large integers n, one can use the quotient of Euclidean division for both of the division operations. This has the advantage of only using integers for each intermediate value, thus making the use of floating point representations of large numbers unnecessary. It is equivalent to using the iterative formula : {x}_{k+1} = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(x_k + \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{ n }{x_k} \\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\right) \\\\right\\\\rfloor, \\\\quad k \\\\ge 0, \\\\quad x_0 > 0, \\\\quad x_0 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}. By using the fact that : \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(x_k + \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{ n }{x_k} \\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\right) \\\\right\\\\rfloor = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(x_k + \\\\frac{ n }{x_k} \\\\right) \\\\right\\\\rfloor, one can show that this will reach \\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt n \\\\rfloor within a finite number of iterations. However, \\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt n \\\\rfloor is not necessarily a fixed point of the above iterative formula. Indeed, it can be shown that \\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt n \\\\rfloor is a fixed point if and only if n + 1 is not a perfect square. If n + 1 is a perfect square, the sequence ends up in a period-two cycle between \\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt n \\\\rfloor and \\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt n \\\\rfloor + 1 instead of converging. =Domain of computation= Although \\\\sqrt{n} is irrational for many n, the sequence \\\\\\\\{ x_k \\\\\\\\} contains only rational terms when x_0 is rational. Thus, with this method it is unnecessary to exit the field of rational numbers in order to calculate \\\\mbox{isqrt}( n ), a fact which has some theoretical advantages. =Stopping criterion= One can prove that c=1 is the largest possible number for which the stopping criterion :|x_{k+1} - x_{k}< c ensures \\\\lfloor x_{k+1} \\\\rfloor=\\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt n \\\\rfloor in the algorithm above. In implementations which use number formats that cannot represent all rational numbers exactly (for example, floating point), a stopping constant less than one should be used to protect against roundoff errors. = Example implementation in C = static inline unsigned ceil_log2(unsigned long n) { return sizeof(unsigned long) * CHAR_BIT - __builtin_clzl(n) - 1; } unsigned long newt_sqrt(unsigned long s) { if (s < 4) return (s + 1) / 2; // Binary estimate. unsigned n = (ceil_log2(s) + 1) / 2; unsigned long r = (1UL << (n - 1)) + (s >> (n + 1)); unsigned long r_o = 0; // Iterate. for (int i = 0; i < 3 && abs(r - r_o) > 1; i++) { r_o = r; r = (r + s / r) >> 1; // division can be slow. } return r; } Digit-by-digit algorithm The traditional pen-and- paper algorithm for computing the square root \\\\sqrt{n} is based on working from higher digit places to lower, and as each new digit pick the largest that will still yield a square \\\\leq n. If stopping after the one's place, the result computed will be the integer square root. =Using bitwise operations= If working in base 2, the choice of digit is simplified to that between 0 (the \\"small candidate\\") and 1 (the \\"large candidate\\"), and digit manipulations can be expressed in terms of binary shift operations. With \`*\` being multiplication, \`<<\` being left shift, and \`>>\` being logical right shift, a recursive algorithm to find the integer square root of any natural number is: def integer_sqrt(n: int) -> int: assert n >= 0, \\"sqrt works for only non-negative inputs\\" if n < 2: return n # Recursive call: small_cand = integer_sqrt(n >> 2) << 1 large_cand = small_cand + 1 if large_cand * large_cand > n: return small_cand else: return large_cand # equivalently: def integer_sqrt_iter(n: int) -> int: assert n >= 0, \\"sqrt works for only non- negative inputs\\" if n < 2: return n # Find the shift amount. See also find first set, # shift = ceil(log2(n) * 0.5) * 2 = ceil(ffs(n) * 0.5) * 2 shift = 2 while (n >> shift) != 0: shift += 2 # Unroll the bit-setting loop. result = 0 while shift >= 0: result = result << 1 large_cand = ( result + 1 ) # Same as result ^ 1 (xor), because the last bit is always 0. if large_cand * large_cand <= n >> shift: result = large_cand shift -= 2 return result Traditional pen- and-paper presentations of the digit-by-digit algorithm include various optimisations not present in the code above, in particular the trick of presubtracting the square of the previous digits which makes a general multiplication step unnecessary.

Limits to classification as a fallacy  Historian Daniel Goldhagen, who had written about the Holocaust, argues that not all comparisons to Hitler and Nazism are logical fallacies since if they all were, there would be nothing to learn from the events that led to the Holocaust. He argues in his book Hitler's Willing Executioners that many people who were complicit or active participants in the Holocaust and subsequently in fascist and neo-Nazi movements have manipulated the historical narrative to escape blame or to deny aspects of the Holocaust.Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust, Daniel Jonah Goldhagen 1997\\"Eichmann was Outrageously Stupid\\".

Claims that allegations of antisemitism are reductio ad Hitlerum have also been employed by David Irving, a British Holocaust denier. The claim of reductio ad Hitlerum has in recent years been employed widely online to shut down criticism of antisemitic and fascistic statements and defense of the use of reductio ad Hitlerum to silence criticism has also been employed more widely in social media by companies such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Allegations of reductio ad Hitlerum is also employed as a technique with which to make general claims about political opponents as making absurd allegations, whether or not they have actually made those allegations in truth. In 2000, Thomas Fleming claimed that reductio ad Hitlerum was being used by his opponents against his values: > Leo Strauss called it the .

There were other individuals from history who were used as stand-ins for pure evil. In the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, the Pharaoh of the Book of Exodus was commonly seen as the most villainous person in history. In the years prior to the American Civil War, abolitionists referred to slaveholders as modern-day Pharaohs. After VE Day, Pharaoh continued to appear in the speeches of social reformers like Martin Luther King Jr. Judas Iscariot and Pontius Pilate were also commonly held up as pure evil. However, there was no universal Hitler- like person and different regions and times used different stand-ins. In the years after the American Revolution, King George III was often vilified in the United States. Andrew Jackson was also called King Andrew the First. During the American Civil War, some Confederates called Lincoln a \\"modern Pharaoh\\".

The town gives its name to the ecclesiastical province of Cashel. Additionally, the cathedra of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly was originally in the town prior to the English Reformation. It is part of the parish of Cashel and Rosegreen in the same archdiocese.Parish of Cashel and Rosegreen, diosesan website. One of the six cathedrals of the Anglican Bishop of Cashel and Ossory, who currently resides in Kilkenny, is located in the town. It is in the civil parish of St. Patricksrock which is in the historical barony of Middle Third. Location and access The town is situated in the Golden Vale, an area of rolling pastureland in the province of Munster. =Roads= It is located off the M8 Dublin to Cork motorway. Prior to the construction of the motorway by- pass (in 2004), the town was noted as a bottleneck on the N8 Dublin to Cork route. =Bus services= Bus √âireann operates an expressway service (route X8) between Dublin and Cork which calls at Cashel. Bus √âireann route 128X provides a link to Portlaoise via Urlingford. The Shamrock Bus Company operates a Thurles to Clonmel route via Cashel. =Rail services= Cashel used to be served by a railway, the Cashel spur line, which is now closed. The nearest railway station is Cahir, 17 kilometers away. This station is on an infrequently serviced line, but is useful if travelling east to/from Waterford. The most convenient and frequently serviced rail station for Cashel is Thurles as this is on the Dublin-Cork InterCity rail line. =Airports= The nearest airports are Cork Airport and Shannon Airport, both of which are around 80 km away. Dublin Airport is located 150 km away, History =Ancient history= The Rock of Cashel, to which the town below owes its origin, is an isolated elevation of stratified limestone, rising abruptly from a broad and fertile plain called the Golden Vale. The top of this eminence is crowned by a group of remarkable ruins. Originally known as Fairy Hill, or Sid-Druim, the Rock was, in pagan times, the dun, or castle, of the ancient Eoghnacht Chiefs of Munster. In Gaelic, Caiseal denotes a circular stone fort and is the name of several places in Ireland. The \\"Book of Rights\\" suggests the name is derived from Cais-il, i.e. \\"tribute stone\\", because the Munster tribes paid tribute on the Rock. Here Corc, grandfather of Aengus Mac Natfraich, erected a fort. Cashel subsequently became the capital of Munster and, like Tara and Armagh, it was a celebrated court. At the time of St. Patrick, when Aengus ruled as king, Cashel claimed supremacy over all the royal duns of the province. In the 5th century, the E√≥ganachta dynasty founded their capital on and around the rock. Many kings of Munster have reigned here since. Saint Patrick is believed to have baptised Cashel's third king, Aengus. In 977 the D√°l gCais usurper, Brian Boru, was crowned here as the first non- E√≥ghanacht king of Cashel and Munster in over five hundred years. In 1101 his great-grandson, King Muirchertach Ua Briain, gave the place to the bishop of Limerick, thus denying it forever to the MacCarthys, the senior branch of the E√≥ganachta. The bishops had a famous school in Cashel and sent priests all over the continent, especially to Regensburg in Germany, where they maintained their own monastery, called Scots Monastery. =Lordship of Ireland= The Synod of Cashel of 1172 was organised by Henry II of England. The Synod sought to regulate some affairs of the Church in Ireland and to condemn some abuses, bringing the Church more into alignment with the Roman Rite. It has been suggested that the seventh act of the Synod called upon the clergy and people of Ireland to acknowledge Henry II of England as their king. However, a careful reading of the seventh act would not support this interpretation. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that the King's purpose in requiring the convocation was to overawe the Irish clergy with a display of his power; no doubt he succeeded in this. In this scenario, the convocation would be viewed as a pretext for the show of strength. St. Dominic's Abbey, a Dominican monastery, was established in 1243. On 30 December 1640, Cashel was captured by an Irish force under Pilib √ì Dubhuir (died 1648) of Dundrum and his brother Donnchadh √ì Dubhuir (hanged in 1652). They took prisoner 300 members of the English garrison and inhabitants. The following day, 15 prisoners were killed as revenge for earlier atrocities against the Irish; however, this was against √ì Dubhuir's orders. In 1647, during the Irish Confederate Wars, the town was stormed and sacked by English Parliamentarian troops under the 6th Baron Inchiquin (later created the 1st Earl of Inchiquin). Over 1,000 Irish Catholic soldiers and civilians, including several prominent clerics, were killed in the attack and ensuing massacre. =Ecclesiastical history= Rock of Cashel About 450, Saint Patrick preached at the royal dun and converted king Aengus. The Tripartite Life of the saint relates that while \\"he was baptising Aengus the spike of the crozier went through the foot of the King\\" who bore with the painful wound in the belief \\"that it was a rite of the Faith\\". According to the same authority, twenty-seven kings of the race of Aengus and his brother Aillil ruled in Cashel until 897, when Cerm-gecan was slain in battle. There is no evidence that St Patrick founded a church at Cashel, or appointed a Bishop of Cashel. St Ailbe, it is supposed, had already fixed his see at Emly, not far off, and within the king's dominions. Cashel continued to be the chief residence of the Kings of Munster until 1100, hence its title, \\"City of the Kings\\". Before that date, there was no mention in the native annals of any Bishop, or Archbishop of Cashel. Cormac MacCullinan is referred to, but not correctly, as Archbishop of Cashel, by later writers. He was a bishop, but not of Cashel, where he was king. The most famous man in Ireland of his time, but more of a scholar and warrior than an ecclesiastic, Cormac has left us a glossary of Irish names, which displays his knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and the \\"Psalter of Cashel\\", a work treating of the history and antiquities of Ireland. He was slain in 903, in a great battle near Carlow. Brian Boru (Old Irish: Brian B√≥ruma) fortified Cashel in 990. Murtagh O'Brien, King of Cashel, in presence of the chiefs and clergy, made a grant in 1101 of the \\"Rock\\" with the territory around it to O'Dunan, \\"noble bishop and chief senior of Munster\\", and dedicated it to God and St. Patrick. Then Cashel became an archiepiscopal see, and O'Dunan its first prelate as far as the primate, St. Celsus, could appoint him. At the synod of Kells, 1152, Cardinal Paparo gave a pallium to Donat O'Lonergan of Cashel, and since then his successors have ruled the ecclesiastical province of Munster. In 1127 Cormac III of Munster, King of Desmond, erected close to his palace on the \\"Rock\\" a church, now known as Cormac's Chapel, which was consecrated in 1134, when a synod was held within its walls. During the episcopate of Donal O'Hullican (1158‚Äì1182), the King of Limerick, Domnall O'Brien, built in 1169 a more spacious church beside Cormac's Chapel, which then became a chapterhouse. Maurice, a Geraldine, filled the see from 1504 to 1523, and was succeeded by Edmund Butler, prior of Athassal Abbey, who was a natural son of Pierce, Earl of Ormond. In addition to the wars between the Irish and the English there arose a new element of discord, the Anglican Reformation introduced by Henry VIII Tudor. While residing at Kilmeaden Castle Archbishop Butler levied black- mail on the traders of the Suir, robbing their boats and holding their persons for ransom. At a session of the royal privy council held at Clonmel in 1539, he swore to uphold the spiritual supremacy of the king and denied the power in Ireland of the Bishop of Rome. He died 1550 and was buried in the cathedral. = Post Reformation = Roland, a Geraldine (1553‚Äì1561), was created archbishop by the Roman Catholic English Queen Mary. After a vacancy of six years, Maurice FitzGibbon (1567‚Äì1578), a Cistercian abbot, was promoted to the archbishopric by Pope Pius V, but James MacCaghwell (McCawell) was put forward by Elizabeth I of England. Thus began the Anglican religion at Cashel. FitzGibbon, who belonged to the royal Desmond family, being deprived of his see, fled to France and passed into Spain where he resided for a time at the Court. He conferred with the English ambassador at Paris to obtain pardon for leaving the country without the Queen's sanction, and to get permission to return. In this he failed, and going back to Ireland secretly he was arrested and imprisoned at Cork, where he died in 1578. On the death of MacCaghwell, Elizabeth advanced Miler MacGrath, a Franciscan and Bishop of Down, to the See of Cashel. He held at the same time four bishoprics and several benefices, out of which he provided for his numerous offspring. Having occupied the see for fifty-two years, he died in 1622. His monument in the ruined cathedral bears an epitaph written by himself. Dermot O'Hurley, or Diarmaid √ì hUrthuile, of Limerick, a distinguished student of the university of Louvain in the Duchy of Brabant and professor at Reims in France, was appointed Archbishop of Cashel in 1581 by Pope Gregory XIII. Having presided over the Roman Catholic diocese secretly for two years, he was discovered and brought before the Lord Justices at Dublin, was tortured upon his refusal to take the Oath of Supremacy to the English crown and was subsequently hanged outside the city on 20 June 1584. Corpus Christi at Rock of Cashel c. 1922 Dr Butler 2nd (1774‚Äì1791), on being appointed to the Roman Catholic diocese, settled in Thurles, where the Roman Catholic archbishops since then have resided. His successor, Archbishop Bray (1792‚Äì1820), built a large church in the early part of the 19th century, on the site of which Archbishop Patrick Leahy (1857‚Äì1874) erected a splendid cathedral in Romanesque style. It was completed and consecrated in 1879 by Archbishop Croke (1874‚Äì1902) and dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption. St Albert (feast 8 January), a reputed former bishop, is the patron saint of the Roman Catholic diocese. The Archbishop of Cashel is Administrator of the ancient Diocese of Emly. The Anglican archbishopric was reduced in status by legislation of 1833 and the bishopric combined initially with Waterford.

The character is given by the trace of certain functions on . The simplest case is when is cocompact, when the representation breaks up into discrete summands. Here the trace formula is an extension of the Frobenius formula for the character of an induced representation of finite groups. When is the cocompact subgroup of the real numbers , the Selberg trace formula is essentially the Poisson summation formula. The case when is not compact is harder, because there is a continuous spectrum, described using Eisenstein series. Selberg worked out the non-compact case when is the group ; the extension to higher rank groups is the Arthur‚ÄìSelberg trace formula. When is the fundamental group of a Riemann surface, the Selberg trace formula describes the spectrum of differential operators such as the Laplacian in terms of geometric data involving the lengths of geodesics on the Riemann surface. In this case the Selberg trace formula is formally similar to the explicit formulas relating the zeros of the Riemann zeta function to prime numbers, with the zeta zeros corresponding to eigenvalues of the Laplacian, and the primes corresponding to geodesics. Motivated by the analogy, Selberg introduced the Selberg zeta function of a Riemann surface, whose analytic properties are encoded by the Selberg trace formula. Early history Cases of particular interest include those for which the space is a compact Riemann surface . The initial publication in 1956 of Atle Selberg dealt with this case, its Laplacian differential operator and its powers. The traces of powers of a Laplacian can be used to define the Selberg zeta function. The interest of this case was the analogy between the formula obtained, and the explicit formulae of prime number theory. Here the closed geodesics on play the role of prime numbers. At the same time, interest in the traces of Hecke operators was linked to the Eichler‚ÄìSelberg trace formula, of Selberg and Martin Eichler, for a Hecke operator acting on a vector space of cusp forms of a given weight, for a given congruence subgroup of the modular group. Here the trace of the identity operator is the dimension of the vector space, i.e. the dimension of the space of modular forms of a given type: a quantity traditionally calculated by means of the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem. Applications The trace formula has applications to arithmetic geometry and number theory. For instance, using the trace theorem, Eichler and Shimura calculated the Hasse‚ÄìWeil L-functions associated to modular curves; Goro Shimura's methods by-passed the analysis involved in the trace formula. The development of parabolic cohomology (from Eichler cohomology) provided a purely algebraic setting based on group cohomology, taking account of the cusps characteristic of non-compact Riemann surfaces and modular curves. The trace formula also has purely differential- geometric applications. For instance, by a result of Buser, the length spectrum of a Riemann surface is an isospectral invariant, essentially by the trace formula. Later work The general theory of Eisenstein series was largely motivated by the requirement to separate out the continuous spectrum, which is characteristic of the non-compact case. The trace formula is often given for algebraic groups over the adeles rather than for Lie groups, because this makes the corresponding discrete subgroup into an algebraic group over a field which is technically easier to work with. Contemporary successors of the theory are the Arthur‚ÄìSelberg trace formula applying to the case of general semisimple G, and the many studies of the trace formula in the Langlands philosophy (dealing with technical issues such as endoscopy). The Selberg trace formula can be derived from the Arthur‚ÄìSelberg trace formula with some effort. Selberg trace formula for compact hyperbolic surfaces A compact hyperbolic surface can be written as the space of orbits :\\\\Gamma \\\\backslash \\\\mathbf{H}, where is a subgroup of , and is the upper half plane, and acts on by linear fractional transformations. The Selberg trace formula for this case is easier than the general case because the surface is compact so there is no continuous spectrum, and the group has no parabolic or elliptic elements (other than the identity). Then the spectrum for the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator on is discrete and real, since the Laplace operator is self adjoint with compact resolvent; that is : 0 = \\\\mu_0 < \\\\mu_1 \\\\leq \\\\mu_2 \\\\leq \\\\cdots where the eigenvalues correspond to -invariant eigenfunctions in of the Laplacian; in other words :\\\\begin{cases} u(\\\\gamma z)=u(z), \\\\qquad \\\\forall \\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\Gamma \\\\\\\\\\\\ y^2 \\\\left (u_{xx} + u_{yy} \\\\right) + \\\\mu_{n} u = 0. \\\\end{cases} Using the variable substitution : \\\\mu = s(1-s), \\\\qquad s=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}+ir the eigenvalues are labeled : r_{n}, n \\\\geq 0. Then the Selberg trace formula is given by :\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty h(r_n) = \\\\frac{\\\\mu(X)}{4 \\\\pi } \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty r \\\\, h(r) \\\\tanh(\\\\pi r)\\\\,dr + \\\\sum_{ \\\\\\\\{T\\\\\\\\} } \\\\frac{ \\\\log N(T_0) }{ N(T)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} - N(T)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} } g(\\\\log N(T)). The right hand side is a sum over conjugacy classes of the group , with the first term corresponding to the identity element and the remaining terms forming a sum over the other conjugacy classes (which are all hyperbolic in this case).

The upper body and left leg of Joannes Baptista (named after John the Baptist) stuck out of his mobile brother, Lazarus.

J. Cashier (December 25, 1843 ‚Äì October 10, 1915), born Jennie Irene Hodgers, was an Irish-born immigrant who served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Cashier adopted the identity of a man before enlisting, and maintained it until death. Cashier became famous as one of a number of women soldiers who served as men during the Civil War, although the consistent and long-term (at least 53 years) commitment to a male identity has prompted some contemporary scholars to suggest that Cashier was a trans man. Early life Cashier was very elderly and disoriented when interviewed about immigrating to the United States and enlisting in the army, and had always been evasive about early life; therefore, the available narratives are often contradictory. According to later investigation by the administrator of Cashier's estate, Albert Cashier was born Jennie Hodgers in Clogherhead, County Louth, Ireland on December 25, 1843, to Sallie and Patrick Hodgers. Typically, the youth's uncle or stepfather was said to have dressed his charge in male clothing in order to find work in an all-male shoe factory in Illinois. Even before the advent of the war, Jenny adopted the identity of Albert Cashier in order to live independently. Sallie Hodgers, Cashier's mother, was known to have died prior to 1862, by which time her child had traveled as a stowaway to Belvidere, Illinois, and was working as a farmhand to a man named Avery.Illinois Issues: Little Soldier, Big Mystery, Illinois Public Radio, July 10, 2018McAuliffe, Nora-Ide. ‚ÄúWhen Jennie Came Marching Home ‚Äì An Irishwoman's Diary on Albert Cashier and the US Civil War.‚Äù The Irish Times, The Irish Times, 10 Apr. 2018, www.irishtimes.com/opinion/when- jennie-came-marching-home-an-irishwoman-s-diary-on-albert-cashier-and-the-us- civil-war-1.3456012. Enlistment Cashier first enlisted in July 1862 after President Lincoln's call for soldiers. As time passed, the need for soldiers only increased. On August 6, 1862, the eighteen-year-old enlisted in the 95th Illinois Infantry for a three-year term using the name \\"Albert D.J. Cashier\\" and was assigned to Company G. Cashier was listed in the company catalog as nineteen years old upon enlistment, and small in stature. Many Belvidere boys had been at the Battle of Shiloh as members of the Fifteenth Illinois Volunteers, where the Union had suffered heavy losses. Cashier took the train along with other boys from Belvidere to Rockford in order to enlist, in answer to the call for more soldiers. Along with others from Boone and McHenry counties, Cashier learned how to be a volunteer infantryman of the 95th Regiment at Camp Fuller. After being shipped out by steamer and rail to Confederate strongholds in Columbus, Kentucky and Jackson, Tennessee, the 95th was ordered to Grand Junction where it became part of the Army of the Tennessee under General Ulysses S. Grant. During the war The regiment was part of the Army of the Tennessee under Ulysses S. Grant and fought in approximately forty battles, including the siege at Vicksburg. During this campaign, Cashier was captured while performing reconnaissance, but managed to escape and return to the regiment. After the Battle of Vicksburg, in June 1863, Cashier contracted chronic diarrhea and entered a military hospital, somehow managing to evade detection. In the spring of 1864, the regiment was also present at the Red River Campaign under General Nathaniel Banks, and in June 1864 at the Battle of Brice's Crossroads in Guntown, Mississippi, where they suffered heavy casualties. Following a period to recuperate and regroup following the debacle at Brice, the 95th, now a seasoned and battle-hardened regiment, saw additional action in the Winter of 1864 in the Franklin- Nashville Campaign, at the battles of Spring Hill and Franklin, the defense of Nashville, and the pursuit of General Hood. During the war, the regiment traveled a total of about 9,000 miles. Other soldiers thought that Cashier was small and preferred to be alone, which were not uncommon characteristics for soldiers. Cashier fought with the regiment through the war until honorably discharged on August 17, 1865, when all the soldiers were mustered out. Cashier was only one of at least 250 soldiers who were assigned female at birth and enlisted as men to fight in the Civil War. Postwar Saunemin After the war, Cashier returned to Belvidere, Illinois for a time, working for Samuel Pepper and continuing to live as a man.\\"Deposition of J. H. Himes\\" (January 24, 1915) from Blanton (Spring 1993) Settling in Saunemin, Illinois in 1869, Cashier worked as a farmhand as well as performing odd jobs around the town. and can be found in the town payroll records. Cashier lived with employer Joshua Chesbro and his family in exchange for work, and had also slept for a time in the Cording Hardware store in exchange for labor. In 1885, the Chesbro family had a small house built for Cashier. For over forty years, Cashier lived in Saunemin and was a church janitor, cemetery worker, and street lamplighter. Living as a man allowed Cashier to vote in elections and to later claim a veteran's pension under the same name. Pension payments started in 1907. In later years, Cashier ate with the neighboring Lannon family. The Lannons discovered their friend's sex when Cashier fell ill, but decided not make their discovery public. In 1911, Cashier, who was working for State Senator Ira Lish, was hit by the Senator's car, resulting in a broken leg. A physician found out the patient's secret in the hospital, but did not disclose the information. No longer able to work, Cashier was moved to the Soldiers and Sailors home in Quincy, Illinois on May 5, 1911. Many friends and fellow soldiers from the Ninety-fifth Regiment visited. Cashier lived there until an obvious deterioration of mind began to take place and was moved to the Watertown State Hospital for the Insane in March 1914. Attendants at the Watertown State Hospital discovered Cashier's sex, at which point, the patient was made to wear women's clothes again after what we can assume would be more than fifty years. In 1914, Cashier was investigated for fraud by the veterans' pension board; former comrades confirmed that Cashier was in fact the person who had fought in the Civil War and the board decided in February 1915 that payments should continue for life. Death and legacy Albert Cashier died on October 10, 1915 and was buried in uniform. The tombstone was inscribed \\"Albert D. J. Cashier, Co. G, 95 Ill. Inf.\\" Cashier was given an official Grand Army of the Republic funerary service, and was buried with full military honors. It took W.J. Singleton (executor of Cashier's estate) nine years to track Cashier's identity back to the birth name of Jennie Hodgers. None of the would-be heirs proved convincing, and the estate of about $282 (after payment of funeral expenses) was deposited in the Adams County, Illinois, treasury. The name on the original tombstone is Albert D. J. Cashier. In the 1970s, a second tombstone, inscribed with both names, was placed near the first one at Sunny Slope cemetery in Saunemin, Illinois. Cashier is listed on the internal wall of the Illinois memorial at Vicksburg National Military Park. A musical entitled The Civility of Albert Cashier has been produced based on Cashier's life; the work was described by the Chicago Tribune as \\"A timely musical about a trans soldier\\". Also Known As Albert D. J. Cashier: The Jennie Hodgers Story is a biography written by veteran Lon P. Dawson, who lived at the Illinois Veterans Home where Cashier once lived. The novel My Last Skirt, by Lynda Durrant, is based on Cashier's life. Cashier was mentioned in a collection of essays called Nine Irish Lives, in which Cashier's biography was written by Jill McDonough. Cashier's house has been restored in Saunemin. Authors including Michael Bronski, James Cromwell, Kirstin Cronn-Mills, and Nicholas Teich have suggested or argued that Cashier was a trans man due to living as a man for at least 53 years.

The O'Leary Line was first headed by Ian Garrow and later by Albert Gu√©risse. In 1943, after their arrests and the destruction of the O'Leary Line by the German Gestapo, Dissard created an escape network called the Francoise Line. The Francoise Line helped more than 250 Allied airmen escape occupied France and return to Great Britain. Including her work with the O'Leary line, Dissard helped more than 700 allied airmen escape from France. She received financial assistance from the British intelligence agency, MI9. Dissard was honored with the Legion of Honor by France, the George Medal by the United Kingdom, and the Medal of Freedom by the United States.

Dissard worked as a secretary for the government of the city of Toulouse. A talented seamstress, she later opened a small dressmaking shop selling \\"modern feminine frivolities.\\" She never married and was an advocate for female independence and freedom. Dissard was small, cheerful, talkative, opinionated, and anti-fascist. She seemed never to sleep and to survive on black coffee and cigarettes held in a long, ivory holder which was always in her mouth. She was followed around by her pet cat named Mifouf.Rossiter, Margaret L. (1986) Women in Resistance, New York: Praeger, p. 32. The French police considered her mentally unbalanced.Catron, Jean-Luc E.

Dissard cooked food for the resisters and took it to the prison two or three times a week. In early July 1942, she met Paul Ullman who was working for the O'Leary escape network. He told her he was hiding English airmen, shot down over Europe, in his home and organizing their escape to Spain. She began to shelter downed airmen in her own apartment and rented a villa in Toulouse to shelter more airmen. She used the code name \\"Fran√ßoise.\\"Cartron, pp. 46-47 By December 1942, she was the leader of the O'Leary line in Toulouse. She enlisted guides and found safe houses for airmen on the run from the Germans. She supplied the airmen with food (mostly purchased on the black market due to rationing), civilian clothing, and medicine, running the line out of her small apartment in the shadow of Gestapo headquarters. She arranged escape routes over the Pyrenees to Spain for airmen and sometimes accompanied them for part of their journey. She also organized the escape of six resistance members and two American airmen from a French jail.Rossiter, pp 32-33 The occupation of Vichy France by German forces in November 1942 made resistance to the Germans more dangerous as German authorities and the Gestapo stepped up efforts to infiltrate and destroy the escape lines operating in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands and funneling downed airmen toward safety in neutral Spain.

Fearing arrest, she fled Toulouse temporarily for Bergerac and relocated nine fugitives to new safe houses, including four airmen and a courier for the O'Leary Line, Nancy Wake, arranging for their passage to Spain. Lacking funds, she then made a clandestine journey to Switzerland and arranged with a British Vice Consul, Victor Farrell, to continue to fund the Line. With regular payments from the British ensured, she reorganized the many safe houses and helpers of the Line scattered all over southern France. She herself escorted airmen by train from various cities and towns to Toulouse and onward to Perpignan where the airmen were turned over to guides who escorted them across the Pyrenees to Spain. Her deputy was Jean Bregi, an associate from the O'Leary Line.Rossiter, pp. 33-34 In January 1944, one of her guides was captured and had the address of her safe house in Toulouse in his notebook. She managed to escape arrest, move airmen to new safe houses, and, with the Gestapo on her trail, hid out in attics and basements in Toulouse. She eventually returned to live surreptitiously in her apartment which was near Gestapo headquarters. With her freedom of movement limited, a young man named Gabriel Nahas who was experienced in moving Jews across the Spanish border became the principal escort of airmen from Toulouse to Perpignan.Rossiter, pp. 33-34 The German occupation of France ended after an allied invasion in summer 1944. Dissard had helped rescue and repatriate more than 250 allied airmen.

He was born in Paris, the son of a businessman. He graduated as an army engineer and in 1938 began to teach as a professor in Saint Cyr military academy. After the outbreak of World War II, Dewavrin was assigned to Norway in 1940 before he joined General Charles de Gaulle in Britain. He received the rank of major, took charge of the Free French military intelligence unit Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action (BCRA), and took the codename \\"Colonel Passy\\". He began to help organize the French Resistance movement and cooperated with the SOE. Some of Dewavrin's closest colleagues ‚Äì Captain Fourcaud and Lieutenant Duclos ‚Äì were Cagoulards (a right-wing group), but Dewavrin always denied that he was. He insisted that he had supported the Republic during the Spanish Civil War and had opposed the Munich Agreement.Lacouture 1991, p254-5 Dewavrin collated information from the French Resistance and planned operations for 350 agents who were parachuted to France to work with them. He secretly traveled to France on occasion to meet with the Resistance and coordinate intelligence gathering and sabotage. On 23 February 1943 Dewavrin parachuted to France alongside Pierre Brossolette to meet with Jean Moulin. Later in 1943 Dewavrin's organization was merged with the conventional secret service of the Free French Forces to form DGSS under Jacques Soustelle. Dewavrin served as Soustelle's technical advisor before he took the lead of the organization in October 1944. After the Normandy Invasion, Dewavrin became Chief of Staff to General Marie Pierre Koenig, the Commander of the French Forces of the Interior. After the war, Dewavrin was head of intelligence for de Gaulle's provisional government until de Gaulle resigned in January 1946. His successor accused Dewavrin of embezzling Free French money for his own purposes. Dewavrin was jailed for four months in Vincennes. He was eventually acquitted for lack of evidence. British historian Antony Beevor suspects that Dewavrin might have tried to collect money to work against a possible communist takeover attempt. Dewavrin published three volumes of memoirs in 1947, 1949, and 1951, and eventually retired from the army to become a businessman. He portrayed himself in Jean Pierre Melville's film, L'Arm√©e des ombres.

The aircraft uses some other form of navigation to place itself in the general area of one end of the pre- computed arc from the 'Cat' station and then is directed to follow the arc. 'Mouse' watches the aircraft approach the target and tells it to drop the bombs at a pre-computed point. Oboe was a British aerial blind bombing system in World War II, based on radio transponder technology. The system consisted of a pair of radio transmitters on the ground, which sent signals which were received and retransmitted by a transponder in the aircraft. By comparing the time each signal took to reach the aircraft, the distance between the aircraft and the station could be determined. The Oboe operators then sent radio signals to the aircraft to bring them onto their target and properly time the release of their bombs. The system was first used in December 1941 in short- range attacks over France where the necessary line of sight could be maintained. To attack the valuable industrial targets in the Ruhr, only the de Havilland Mosquito flew high enough to be visible to the ground stations at that distance. Such operations began in 1942, when Pathfinder squadron Mosquitos used Oboe both to mark targets for heavy bombers, as well as for direct attacks on high-value targets. In an attack on 21 December 1942, Oboe- guided bombers dropped over 50% of their bombs on the Krupp factories in Essen, an enormous improvement over previous efforts that resulted in less than 10% of bombs landing on their targets. Versions using shorter wavelengths demonstrated accuracy on the order of . Oboe was used extensively by Pathfinder marker aircraft during the Battle of the Ruhr in 1943. In December 1943 Bomber Command began the Battle of Berlin, which was beyond the range of Oboe. For the campaign against Berlin Bomber Command was forced to rely on H2S instead, which never was able to provide the consistent accuracy of Oboe. A later development was the Gee-H system, in which the transponder remained on the ground but the transmitter was mounted in the aircraft where the readout was made. This system allowed around 80 aircraft to be guided at the same time. Neither H2S nor Gee-H could provide the accuracy of Oboe, which demonstrated the highest average bombing accuracy of any system in the war. History =Background= In order to accurately determine your location relative to objects on the ground you need two data points; two angles (as in triangulation), two distances (trilateration), or an angle and a distance (VOR/DME). Using radio to provide some or all of these measurements was an area of continual development leading up to the start of the war. The Germans pioneered this approach with operational systems like Lorenz beam and X-Ger√§t that used two narrow beam-like signals that crossed at a point in the sky to indicate a target. Later during The Blitz, the Germans introduced Y-Ger√§t, which combined a single Lorenz beam with a transponder-based distance measurement to fix locations. The problem with all of these systems was that they produced no information except within their narrow beams, and were not useful for general purpose navigation. A more useful system was introduced in the RAF's Gee system, which used two timed signals that allowed the navigator on the bomber to determine their location. It could be used anywhere within line-of-sight of the transmitter stations in the UK, and generally provided a reasonable signal up to about , depending on the aircraft's altitude. Gee was read on an oscilloscope display about across, which limited the accuracy of the timing measurements. As a result, Gee was accurate on the order of kilometers, which was extremely useful for navigation and area bombing, but did not provide the accuracy needed for pinpoint bombing. As the accuracy of Gee was largely due to the mechanical size of the indicator unit, the accuracy could be improved by using a larger display. However, in these early days of the cathode ray tube (CRT), such displays were extremely expensive and very long, which made them unsuitable for fitting to a large number of Bomber Command aircraft. =Initial proposal= The concept of reversing the display arrangement so the display could be on the ground and the transmitter on the aircraft was obvious. It had first been suggested by Alec Reeves of Standard Telephones and Cables in 1940 and then formally presented with the help of Francis Jones in the spring of 1941. The basic idea would be to have two ground stations that would periodically send out signals on similar but separate frequencies. The aircraft carried transponders, one for each signal, which re-broadcast the signals upon reception. By timing the total round trip time from broadcast to reception and then dividing by twice the speed of light (the signal travels to the aircraft and back again) the distance to the aircraft could be determined. This was essentially identical to radar, with the exception that the transponder greatly amplified the signals for the return journey, which aided accuracy by providing strong, sharply defined signal pulses. A practical problem was using these range measurements to guide a bomber towards its target. In the case of Y-Ger√§t, a single beam was used that produced a natural path for the bomber to fly along. Only the range along this path needed to be measured and relayed to the bomber crew. In the case of a system using two range measurements, there was no inherent path in the sky for the aircraft to follow. Locations and directions could be determined by the phoning the two range measurements to a plotting room, drawing arcs from the stations at those measured distances, and then locating the intersection. However, this took time, during which the aircraft moved, making it too slow to provide the desired accuracy. Oboe adopted a simple solution to this problem. Before the mission, a path was defined that represented the arc of a circle whose radius passed through the target as measured from one of the two stations. This station was given the name \\"Cat\\". The aircraft would then use conventional navigation techniques, dead reckoning or Gee if it was equipped, to place itself some distance north or south of the target on a point near this line. They would then begin flying towards the target, at which point an operator at Cat would call out corrections to have the aircraft fly closer or further from the station until it was flying at precisely the right range to keep it on the circle. The Cat station continued to keep the aircraft positioned at this precise distance as it flew towards the target, causing the aircraft to fly along the pre-defined arc. The second station, code-named \\"Mouse\\", also calculated the range to the target before the mission. As the bomber approached that predetermined range they would first call out a \\"heads up\\" to tell the bomb aimer to begin the run, and then a second signal at the right time to drop it. Using this method there was no need for the two stations to compare measurements or perform any trigonometry to determine an actual location in space, both performed simple range measurements directly off their screen and sent their separate corrections to the aircraft. In practice, ranges were not sent by voice to the aircraft. Instead, a tone generator produced Morse code dots or dashes under the control of the operators. This was similar to the beam systems like Lorenz, which the UK aircrew were already familiar with using as a blind landing aid in the pre-war period. If the aircraft was too close to the station the operator would play the dot signal, and when they were too far, dashes. The two could be mixed so that as they approached the correct range, the dots would fill in the gaps between the dashes and form a steady tone. Periodically the signal would be keyed to send out a letter to indicate how far they were from the correct range, X indicating , Y , and Z . Likewise, the Mouse station sent a series of keyed signals to indicate the approach, S to indicate the approach was starting, and then A, B, C and D as the aircraft approached. =Development and testing= The left side of this image shows an Oboe navigation console. The two CRTs, some of the largest built during that era, were used for gross and fine distance measurement. This control room is built into a Nissen hut (or similar) which may suggest it is one of the mobile sites moved to continental Europe after D-Day. There were some obvious problems with this approach, however. One of the most obvious is that any given ground station could only track a single aircraft at a time, compared to Gee where any bomber could pick up the signals from the UK and carry out the necessary calculations. This did not immediately eliminate it as a useful system; Y-Ger√§t had the same limitation, so it was used for target marking by flying one aircraft under control and having it drop flares for the following aircraft to drop on. The British adopted the same solution. But a more worrying concern was that the bomber aircraft would have to fly straight and level along a gently curving path while the ground operators determined its range and radioed it corrections. During this time the aircraft would be open to attack, which some considered to be almost suicidal. And finally, it was pointed out that as the British had so easily jammed Y-Ger√§t, even before it was widely used, there was no reason to expect the Germans would not do the same as soon as they detected the signals. Despite widespread opposition to the use of Oboe, A.P. Rowe ordered development to begin. Development began both on the 1.5 m wavelength shared by most early UK radar systems, but also at the new \\"fashionable\\" 10 cm microwave wavelength provided by the cavity magnetron. The latter would not only provide higher accuracy, but also be largely immune to jamming unless the Germans developed their own high-power microwave devices. This only occurred in the very last days of the war. Two stations were set up as far east as possible, one in Dover (Walmer) and a second in Cromer (RAF Trimingham)). On any given mission, one of the stations would be Cat and the other Mouse. In early testing in September 1941, an aircraft flying along the arc from Dover demonstrated an accuracy of , better than any bombing method then in use. Accuracy with bombs was not quite as good, as the bombs themselves were not identical and had slightly different trajectories. In a demonstration for senior officials on 2 July 1942, the system demonstrated a real-world accuracy of . In contrast, even using advanced visual bombsights like the Norden, average accuracies in 1942 were on the order of . Oboe was first used in experimental operations by Short Stirling heavy bombers in December 1941, attacking Brest. These aircraft had a relatively limited service ceiling, and was limited to attacks at short-range where they maintained line-of-sight to the UK.Hooton 1994, p. 114. At that time there was a great debate taking place in Bomber Command over the use of \\"pathfinders\\", specialized aircraft and crews that would find the targets and use flares to mark them for attack. The same technique had first been used during the Blitz by the Germans, notably by the specialist Kampfgeschwader 100, but its effectiveness had been severely curtailed by British jamming efforts. Nevertheless, the concept had enough backing that a small force of Mosquitoes had been organized to operate as a pathfinder force, using normal optical sighting. This proved disappointing in practice, offering only a slight improvement in accuracy. But the Mosquitoes were also the only aircraft that had the performance to fly at altitudes at which the Oboe signals could be received over Germany. At a meeting in the summer of 1942, it was agreed that the pathfinder Mosquitoes would be equipped with Oboe. Having faced opposition before, the addition of Oboe upset the argument against the specialist role, and what would become Pathfinder Force began forming over the ongoing objections. =Into service= The first experiments with Oboe in a combat setting over Germany began on the night of 20/21 December 1942, when a small force of six Oboe-equipped Mosquitoes were sent to bomb a power station at Lutterade in the Netherlands, on the German border. Three of the sets failed, but the three remaining aircraft, led by Squadron Leader L.E. Bufton, were able to drop properly. A follow-up reconnaissance mission the next day showed that nine of the bomb craters could be identified, all of them clustered closely together but some away from the target. Similar tests with small numbers of Oboe aircraft, sometimes dropping flares for small numbers of Avro Lancasters following them, were made throughout December and January. At first, the Germans wrote off these small attacks as nuisance raids, intended to upset production by sending the workers to the air raid shelters. However, it was soon realized that something very odd was occurring; aircraft were dropping only 6 to 10 bombs, often through heavy cloud cover, and having 80 to 90% of them hit their targets, normally blast furnaces or power stations. As part of this process, the bombers released photoflash flares, which lit up the ground below the aircraft enough for photography. On 7 January 1943, Hauptmann Alexander Dahl noted these and suggested that they were using the photographs to correct for measurement errors of a new bombing system. This was precisely what had been happening. Over the UK Oboe demonstrated accuracy on the order of tens of metres, but over the Continent the early tests always produced worse results. But it was soon clear there was a pattern to the misses, which was surmised to be due to differences in the surveying grids used on the continent. The solution to this problem was provided by the Germans themselves; before the war they had made an effort to calibrate the two systems in a series of cross-Channel measurements that the UK Ordnance Survey also received. Using these corrections they were able to address the inaccuracies almost immediately. By the late spring Bomber Command crews had practised the bomb-on-marker technique enough to begin major operations. Harris then began a series of raids known as the Battle of the Ruhr, opening with a raid on Essen on 5 March that produced rather poor results in spite of proper marking. The next major raid against the Krupp factory in Essen on 12/13 March was somewhat more successful, followed by a mix of raids that met with very different results. By May, however, the technique was tuned and a series of very large raids, typically with 500 to 800 bombers, demonstrated increasingly successful results. Among these was a late-May raid on Dortmund that caused the Hoesch steelworks to cease production, and a late July raid on Krupps that Goebbels stated had caused \\"complete stoppage of production in the Krupps works\\".RAF History - Bomber Command 60th Anniversary \\"No. 8 (Pathfinder Force) Group\\" Analysis of the results demonstrated that the number of bombs that fell on their targets doubled from the pre-Oboe era. =German countermeasures= Oboe missions were clearly identifiable to German radar operators; the aircraft would start some distance north or south of the target and then approach it on an arcing path they referred to as \\"Boomerang\\". Although the operators quickly became accustomed to these aircraft, actually arranging an interception of the high-flying and high-speed aircraft proved extremely difficult. It took the Germans more than a year to decipher the operation of the system, led by the engineer H. Widdra, who had detected the British \\"Pip-squeak\\" Identification friend or foe [IFF] system in 1940. The first attempt to jam Oboe took place at the end of August 1943 during an attack on the Bochumer Verein steelworks in Essen. A system set up at the Maibaum tracking station in Kettwig broadcast false dot and dash signals on the 1.5 m band, hoping to make it impossible for the pilot to figure out if they were at the right position. This was the same technique that the British had used against German systems during The Blitz. However, the Oboe system had already moved to the microwave-frequency 10 cm Oboe Mk. II, but the British kept broadcasting the older signals as a ruse. The failure to jam Oboe remained a mystery until July 1944, when the older signal was incorrectly set to mark one target while a pathfinder perfectly marked another. The Germans quickly surmised that there was another signal or system in use. The Germans were well acquainted with the British microwave systems in the 10 cm area, but in April 1944 the RAF had already introduced Oboe Mk. III, which resisted German jamming efforts. Mk. III also allowed up to four aircraft to use a set of frequencies (stations) and allowed different styles of approach, not just the arc. =Late war use= By this point the Battle of the Ruhr was long over and the majority of the RAF's bombing efforts concentrated on targets that were too far into Germany to be visible to Oboe. H2S took on the primary role in this era. The D-Day invasions and subsequent breakout allowed this to be addressed by setting up new Oboe stations on the continent. Late in the war, Oboe was used to assist food drops to the Dutch still trapped under German occupation, as part of Operation Manna. Drop points were arranged with the Dutch Resistance and the food canisters were dropped within about of the aiming point using Oboe. Technical details Oboe used two stations at well- separated locations in England to transmit a signal to a Mosquito Pathfinder bomber carrying a radio transponder. The transponder re-transmitted the signals, which were then received by the two stations. The round-trip time of each signal gave the distance to the bomber. Each Oboe station used radio ranging to define a circle of specific radius. The intersection of the two circles pinpointed the target. The Mosquito flew along the circumference of the circle defined by one station, known as the \\"Cat\\", and dropped its load (either bombs or marking flares, depending on the mission) when it reached the intersection with the circle defined by another station, known as \\"Mouse\\". There was a network of Oboe stations over southern England and any of the stations could be operated as a Cat or a Mouse. The Mark I Oboe was derived from Chain Home Low technology, operating at upper-range VHF frequencies of 200 MHz (1.5 metres). The two stations emitted a series of pulses at a rate of about 133 per second. The pulse width could be made short or long so it was received by the aircraft as a Morse code dot or dash. The Cat station sent continuous dots if the aircraft was too close and continuous dashes if the aircraft was too far and from these the pilot could make course corrections. (The Germans used a similar method with Knickebein.) Various Morse letters could also be sent; for example, to notify an aircrew that their Mosquito was within a range of the target. The Mouse station sent five dots and a dash to indicate bomb release. The Mouse station included a bombsight computer, known as \\"Micestro\\", to determine the proper release time; there was no particular logic in carrying the bombsight on the Mosquito when it was under the control of the ground station. Although Oboe had been tested against Essen in January 1943, Oboe was rarely used for \\"big industrial plants\\" such as those in the Ruhr Area. The basic idea of Oboe came from Alec Reeves of Standard Telephones and Cables Ltd, implemented in a partnership with Frank Jones of the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE); also part of the team was Dr Denis Stops, who later became a leading physicist at University College London.http://www.ucl.ac.uk Denis Stops' role in the development of Oboe was so secret that he was drafted into the RAF Pathfinder Squadron as a Wing Commander to conduct his work. His role was largely to develop the systems on the aircraft in conjunction with the land-based radar systems. The system worked by using triangulation to pin-point the target. Dr. Stops once said that one unexpected spin-off of the system was that the Germans often did not know what the British were planning to bomb. Similar systems The Germans improvised a system conceptually similar to Oboe, code named Egon, for bombing on the Eastern Front on a limited scale. It used two modified Freyas to play the roles of Cat and Mouse; these two Freya Egon sets were located about apart and the aircraft carried a two-channel IFF to respond to them. Voice radio directed the bombers. Despite the considerable effort the Germans put into other electronic navigation systems, they never took this concept further. notes the code names, the use of IFF and the separations of the Freyas. Along with the range restriction, Oboe had another limitation: it could only really be used by one aircraft at a time. As a result, the British rethought Oboe, and came up with a new scheme named \\"GEE-H\\" (or \\"G-H\\") based on exactly the same thinking, differing only in having the aircraft carry the transmitter and fitting ground stations with the transponder. Aircraft could use the two stations in parallel, because random noise was inserted into the timing of each aircraft's pulse output. The receiving gear on the aircraft could match its own unique pulse pattern with that sent back by the transponder. Each receive‚Äìreply cycle took the transponder 100 microseconds, allowing it to handle a maximum of 10,000 interrogations per second and making \\"collisions\\" unlikely. The practical limit was about 80 aircraft at one time. The name \\"GEE-H\\" can be confusing, since the scheme was very close to Oboe and not very much like GEE. The name was adopted because the system was based on GEE technologies, operating on the same waveband of 15 to 3.5 metres / 20 to 85 MHz, and initially used the GEE display and calibrator. The \\"H\\" suffix came from the system using the twin-range or 'H' principle of measuring the range from transponders at two ground stations. It was about as accurate as Oboe. In popular culture Oboe appears as a plot point in the \\"Lost Sheep\\" episode of the BBC television series Secret Army, which featured the search for a downed airman with technical knowledge of the system.

She came to the attention of a wealthy bookmaker and gambler, Joseph Epstein, who became her financial advisor and reputed lover (although Epstein was known to be gay), and ultimately, Hill entered into the Chicago Outfit crime organization. In addition to being sexually passed around the Chicago mob, she was used as a courier to pass messages between mobsters. One contemporary commentator described Hill as: > ... more than just another set of curves. She had ... a good memory, a > considerable flair for hole-in-the-corner diplomacy to allay the suspicions > of trigger-happy killers and a dual personality, close-lipped about > essentials, and able to chatter freely, and apparently foolishly about > inconsequentials. Even law enforcement eventually concluded that she was a \\"central clearing house\\" for intelligence on organized crime and enjoyed an independent power base within the Mafia. Eventually Hill became associated with Charles Fischetti, a cousin and bodyguard of Al Capone. It was Fischetti who sent Hill to New York to keep tabs on Luciano family capo Joe Adonis, which she did by becoming his lover. Hill told people that she was a Southern-belle society girl who had gone through four rich husbands, all divorced or dead, and that she had received $1 million each from their estates, but authentic socialites saw through the ruse. Hill built up an entourage of hangers-on and Latin gigolos hanging out on Broadway and frequently picked up the check. While in New York, Hill was introduced to another Luciano associate, Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel, and they ended up in a hotel together that night. Later Siegel's and Hill's separate life paths brought them both to Hollywood, and they began a torrid affair. There were rumors that she and Siegel were secretly married in Mexico after Siegel divorced his wife Esta in 1946, but there has not been any evidence to prove the theory.Hill's boyfriend, Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel NYC police mugshot on April 12, 1928. Lore has it that Siegel named the Flamingo Las Vegas resort after Hill, who loved to gamble and whose nickname was supposedly \\"Flamingo,\\" a moniker that Siegel was said to have given her, referring to her long, thin legs, but others have said that Hill was in fact short and somewhat matronly in form. Another story about the origin of the nickname said that after a few drinks, Hill's face would flush a flamingo-like pink. However, organized crime king Lucky Luciano wrote in his memoir that Siegel once owned an interest in the Hialeah Park Race Track and viewed the flamingos who populated nearby as a good omen. The \\"Flamingo\\" name was given to the project at its inception by original resort financier Billy Wilkerson. Four days before Siegel was assassinated at Hill's home in California (June 1947), Hill took an unscheduled flight to Paris, France, giving rise to speculation that she was warned in advance of Siegel's impending murder. In 1950, Hill married Hans Hauser, an Austrian skier; later giving birth to their only child, Peter Hauser (November 20, 1950 ‚Äì 1994). In 1951, Hill was subpoenaed to testify before the Kefauver hearings, where she denied having any knowledge of organized crime despite being described by Time magazine in March of that year as the \\"queen of the gangsters' molls.\\" After Hill was indicted for income tax evasion in 1954, she moved to Europe, where she lived for the rest of her life with her son. Death and legacy Hill died of an overdose of sleeping pills in Koppl, near Salzburg, Austria, on March 24, 1966 at the age of 49. Hill is buried in Aigen Cemetery in Salzburg. According to Andy Edmonds' biography Bugsy's Baby: The Secret Life of Mob Queen Virginia Hill, her death was suspicious despite it being an apparent suicide. The Austrian media, which were well informed about her former relationship with Siegel, speculated that she tried to get money by using her knowledge of the Italian-American Mafia .Compare the Salzburger Nachrichten, Salzburger Volksblatt (defunct since 1979) and the illustrated newspaper Bunte made by Burda ‚Äì Offenburg in Germany from spring 1966. Hill was the subject of a 1974 television movie, in which she was portrayed by Dyan Cannon. She was played by Annette Bening in the 1991 film Bugsy, a dramatization of her relationship with Bugsy Siegel (portrayed by Warren Beatty). Hill was also the \\"loose\\" basis for Joan Crawford's character \\"Ethel Whitehead\\"/\\"Lorna Hansen Forbes\\" in the 1950 film noir The Damned Don't Cry.The Damned Don't Cry on IMDb References  Further reading  * Edmonds, Andy.

During the war, over a thousand stations were built. A naval version operating on a slightly different wavelength was also developed as the Seetakt. Development First tests of what would become the \\"Freya\\" were conducted in early 1937, with initial delivery of an operational radar to the Kriegsmarine in 1938 by the GEMA company. Freya supported an early version of Identification friend or foe (IFF). Aircraft equipped with the FuG 25a \\"Erstling\\" IFF system could be successfully queried across ranges of over 100 km. The \\"AN\\" version gained a switchable phasing line for the antenna. Switching in the phasing line led to a phase displacement of the antenna's radiation pattern and with that, a squinting to the left or right. This enabled the system in effect to switch from the rather broad \\"scanning for maxima\\" to narrow lobe switching. In that mode, a skilled operator could achieve an angular resolution of 0.1¬∞. The Freya radar was more advanced than its British counterpart, Chain Home. Freya operated on a wavelength (250 MHz) while Chain Home used 12 m. This allowed Freya to use a much smaller antenna system, one that was easier to rotate, move and position. It also offered higher resolution, allowing it to detect smaller targets. Because of its complex design, only eight Freya stations were operational when the war started, resulting in large gaps between the covered areas. The British Chain Home radar, although less advanced and more prone to errors, was simpler, which meant that the complete Chain Home network was in place in time for the Battle of Britain.  Variants  * FuMG 450 Freya AN, initially called FuMG 41G (range increased to 120 km) * FuMG Freya LZ (could be disassembled for airlift) * FuMG 480 * FuMG 44 \\"Drehfreya\\" (German: \\"rotating Freya\\"), transitional model to FuMG 44/404 (navy: FuMO371), \\"Jagdschloss\\" PPI radar * FuMG 451 \\"Freiburg\\", 162‚Äì200 MHz * FuMG 321-328 (German naval designation) Deployment and operation Freya was often used in concert with the primary German gun laying radar, W√ºrzburg Riese (\\"W√ºrzburg Giant\\"); the Freya finding targets at long distances and then \\"handing them over\\" to the shorter-ranged W√ºrzburgs for tracking. Later in the war, Freya operated in the band from (120 to 130 MHz), with a pulse width of three microseconds, a peak power output of 15 to 20 kW, and a pulse repetition frequency of 500 Hz. It had a maximum range of only , making it inferior to Chain Home. Furthermore, it could not accurately determine altitude, but it was a fully steerable and semi-mobile system. W√ºrzburg-Riese, date and place unknown Freya was first successfully used on December 18, 1939 when two stations detected an approaching daytime raid on Wilhelmshaven by 22 RAF Vickers Wellington bombers at a range of 113 km and guided fighter planes toward them via radio.The Radar War, by Gerhard Hepcke, translated into English by Hannah Liebermann Only half of the Wellingtons returned to Britain undamaged, but the German fighters only reached the bomber after they had made their bombing run on ships in harbour. The performance of Freya left the Luftwaffe so impressed that, by the Spring of 1940, eleven Freya stations were installed to guard Germany's western border.Description of the first German radar sites After the invasion of France in 1940, additional Freya stations were built along the Atlantic coast. When Britain started its bombing raids, Hermann G√∂ring ordered Colonel (later General) Josef Kammhuber to install an efficient air defence. This led to the so-called Kammhuber Line into which more Freya stations were incorporated. In the later course of the war, Freya devices turned out to be vulnerable to chaff, along with other countermeasures, which meant they could still be used for early warning, but no longer for guiding fighter planes. British bombing raids could also be organized such that the Kammhuber Line could be overwhelmed in massed raids.  British intelligence  One of the first to give British intelligence any details about the Freya Radar was a young Danish Flight Lieutenant, Thomas Sneum, who, at great risk to his life, photographed radar installations on the Danish island of Fan√∏ in 1941. He brought the negatives to Britain in a dramatic flight which is fictionalized in Ken Follett's novel Hornet Flight. Sneum's deed is also mentioned in R. V. Jones's Most Secret War as a 'most gallant exploit' and is one of the featured stories in Courage & Defiance by Deborah Hopkinson.  Further development  FuMG 401 \\"Freya-Fahrstuhl\\" (German: Freya elevator) * FuMG 401: For experiments with beam reflection on the ground, leading to a change in elevation angle, a Freya antenna array was installed on a wooden support so it could slide up and down. This enabled Freya to detect the target's altitude without the aid of other devices (such as W√ºrzburg radars). * FuMG 41: In an attempt to increase the range without changing the transmitter, several Freya antenna arrays were switched together. These installations, called \\"Wassermann\\" (German: Aquarius), not only had greater range but were also more accurate. Countermeasures To counter Freya, the British used equipment called 'Moonshine'. Carried by Boulton Paul Defiant aircraft of the Special Duties Flight (later No. 515 Squadron RAF), a single set retransmitted a portion of the Freya signal amplifying the apparent return. Eight planes with 'Moonshine' could mimic a force of 100 bombers.Brew, The Defiant File 1996 A second countermeasures system, \\"Mandrel\\" was a noise jammer carried by aircraft of No. 100 Group RAF which overwhelmed the signals from Freya. Individual aircraft were sent to orbit fixed positions off the enemy coast. By using nine aeroplanes, a gap could be knocked into the German's radar coverage, while further jammers were carried in the bomber stream to counter the inland Freya network.Price 1979, pp. 124‚Äì125.

Toye was born in San Pedro, California and developed retinitis pigmentosa in the early age. In 1968 he begin a mail scam where people would send him $5 application fee to receive work stuffing envelopes. 1973 he was sentenced for mail fraud and jailed in Springfield, Missouri. In prison he heard that bank tellers in federally insured banks were instructed to hand out the money to robbers without incident. So, when Toye was released 1974, he proceeded to make his first bank robbery shortly after he had left the prison. He was armed only with his white cane and a note that claimed he had a gun. Toye concentrated on using his right eye to see shadowy impressions of other people's feet and followed them to the bank teller's window. There he would flash a one-eyed jack with a text \\"Be quick, be quiet, or you're dead. Put all the cash in the bag. I have a gun\\". When he had received the money, he retreated back to the door. He used the same technique many times. Toye was captured 1977 in New York City when he collided with armed guards that were delivering money to the bank. Next six years he spent in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. When he got out in February 1983, he went to a Citibank and stole $18,000. Toye moved to Las Vegas but made a list of all the Citibank branches in New York. Nine times he flew to New York to rob a bank and immediately returned to Las Vegas after the robbery. He put the money in a Vegas bank account under a false name. He was arrested May 24, 1983 when he took a detour to a discount store. Toye was sentenced to 17 years and tried to escape 11 times. In an interview for the People magazine in 1990, Toye claimed that he had given part of his loot to charity, including to retinitis pigmentosa research. At the time he had robbed 17 banks and was serving time in Lompoc Federal Penitentiary, near Santa Barbara, California, due to be released 1993.

It was claimed to have been developed in 1995 by Romke Jan Bernhard Sloot (27 August 1945, Groningen ‚Äì 11 July 1999, Nieuwegein), a Dutch electronics engineer. Sloot died suddenly on July 11, 1999, of a heart attack, just days before the conclusion of a contract to sell the invention. The full source code was never recovered, and the technique and claim has since never been reproduced or verified.  Background  Sloot was born the youngest of three children. His father, a school headmaster, left his family quite soon after Sloot's birth. Sloot was enrolled at a Dutch technical school, but dropped out early to work at a radio station. After fulfilling mandatory military service, Sloot settled in Utrecht with his wife. He worked briefly for Philips Electronics in Eindhoven. He left this job in 1978 after a year and a half, starting his next job in Groningen at an audio and video store. A few years later he moved to Nieuwegein where he started his own company repairing televisions and stereos. In 1984, Sloot began focusing on computer technology such as the Philips P2000, Commodore 64, IBM PC XT, and AT. Sloot developed the idea of a countrywide repair service network called RepaBase with a database containing details on all repairs carried out. This concept was the motivation to develop alternative data storage techniques that would require significantly less space than traditional methods.  Sloot Encoding System  In 1995, Sloot claimed to have developed a data encoding technique that could store an entire feature film in only 8 kilobytes. For comparison, even with the most modern techniques, a very low-quality video file normally requires 10,000 times more storage space, and a higher quality video file could require 175,000 times more data. Roel Pieper, former CTO and board member of Philips, is quoted as saying (translated from Dutch): In 1996, Sloot received an investment from colleague Jos van Rossum, a cigarette machine operator. The same year, Sloot and van Rossum were granted a 6-year Dutch patent for the Sloot Encoding System, naming Sloot as inventor and Van Rossum as patent owner. Despite the apparent impossibility of the encoding system, there were investors who saw potential. In early 1999, Dutch investor Marcel Boekhoorn joined the group. In March 1999, the system was demonstrated to Pieper. Pieper resigned from Philips in May 1999 and joined Sloot's company as CEO, which was re-branded as The Fifth Force, Inc. The story‚Äîincluding an account of a believable demonstration of the technology‚Äîis told in modest detail in Tom Perkins' 2007 book Valley Boy: The Education of Tom Perkins.  Death of Sloot  On July 11, 1999, Sloot was found dead, in his garden at his home in Nieuwegein of an apparent heart attack. He died one day before the deal was to be signed with Pieper. The family consented to an autopsy, but no autopsy was performed. Perkins, the co-founder of the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, had agreed to invest in the technology when Sloot died. Perkins and Pieper would have proceeded after Sloot's death, but a key piece of the technology, a compiler stored on a floppy disk, had disappeared and, despite months of searching, was never recovered.

He is most famous today as a founder of modern comparative historical linguistics. In 1767 he became a judge in the Court of Session. As such, Burnett adopted an honorary title based on the name of his father's estate and family seat, Monboddo House. Monboddo was one of a number of scholars involved at the time in development of early concepts of biological evolution. Some credit him with anticipating in principle the idea of natural selection that was read by (and acknowledged in the writings of) Erasmus Darwin. Charles Darwin read the works of his grandfather Erasmus and later developed the ideas into a scientific theory. Early years James Burnett was born in 1714 at Monboddo House in Kincardineshire, Scotland. After his primary education at the parish school of Laurencekirk, he studied at Marischal College, Aberdeen, from where he was graduated in 1729. He also studied at University of Edinburgh and the University of Groningen. At Edinburgh University he graduated in law and was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1737. Burnett married Elizabethe Farquharson and they had two daughters and a son. The younger daughter Elizabeth Burnett was an Edinburgh celebrity, known for her beauty and amiability, but who died of consumption (tuberculosis) at the age of 24. Burnett's friend the Scottish poet Robert Burns, had a romantic interest in Elizabeth and wrote a poem, \\"Elegy on The Late Miss Burnet of Monboddo\\", praising her beauty, which became her elegy. Monboddo's early work in practising law found him in a landmark piece of litigation of his time, known as the Douglas \\"cause\\", or case. The matter involved the inheritance standing of a young heir, Archibald James Edward Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas, and took on the form of a mystery novel of the era, with a complex web of events spanning Scotland, France and England. Burnett, as the solicitor for the young Douglas heir, was victorious after years of legal battle and appeals. Later years The grave of Lord Patrick Grant, Greyfriars Kirkyard ‚Äì containing Lord Monboddo From 1754 until 1767 Monboddo was one of a number of distinguished proprietors of the Canongate Theatre. He clearly enjoyed this endeavour even when some of his fellow judges pointed out that the activity might cast a shadow over his sombre image as jurist. Here he had occasion to further associate with David Hume who was a principal actor in one of the plays. He had actually met Hume earlier when Monboddo was a curator of the Advocates Library and David Hume served as keeper of that library for several years while he wrote his history. From 1769 until 1775 John Hunter acted as his personal secretary. Parliament House, housing the Court of Session In the era after Monboddo was appointed to Justice of the high court, he organised \\"learned suppers\\" at his house on 13 St John Street, off the Canongate in Edinburgh's Old Town, where he discussed and lectured about his theories. Local intellectuals were invited to attend attic repasts. Henry Home, Lord Kames was conspicuously absent from such socialising; while Kames and Monboddo served on the high court at the same time and had numerous interactions, they were staunch intellectual rivals. Monboddo rode to London on horseback each year and visited Hampton Court as well as other intellectuals of the era; the King himself was fond of Monboddo's colourful discussions. Monboddo died in Edinburgh on 26 May 1799 and is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh along with his daughter Elizabeth where they have unmarked graves in the burial enclosure of Patrick Grant, Lord Elchies (within the non-public section known as the Covenanters Prison). Historical linguistics In The Origin and Progress of Language Burnett analysed the structure of languages, and argued that humans had evolved language skills in response to changing environment and social structures. Burnett was the first to note that some languages create lengthy words for rather simple concepts. He reasoned that in early languages there was an imperative for clarity, so that redundancy was built in and seemingly unnecessary syllables added. He concluded that this form of language evolved when clear communication might be the determinant of avoiding danger. Lord Monboddo's original inkwell from c. 1760 Monboddo studied languages of peoples colonised by Europeans, including those of the Carib, Eskimo, Huron, Algonquian, Peruvian (Quechua?) and Tahitian peoples. He saw the preponderance of polysyllabic words, where some of his predecessors had dismissed these languages as a series of monosyllabic grunts. He also observed that in Huron (or Wyandot) the words for very similar objects are astoundingly different. This fact led Monboddo to perceive that these peoples needed to communicate reliably regarding a more limited number of subjects than in modern civilisations, which led to the polysyllabic and redundant nature of many words. He also came up with the idea that these languages are generally vowel-rich and that correspondingly, languages such as German and English are vowel-starved. According to Burnett, this disparity partially arises from the greater vocabulary of Northern European languages and the decreased need for the polysyllabic content. Monboddo also traced the evolution of modern European languages and gave particularly great effort to understanding the ancient Greek language, in which he was proficient. He argued that Greek is the most perfect language ever established because of its complex structure and tonality, rendering it capable of expressing a wide gamut of nuances. Monboddo was the first to formulate what is now known as the single-origin hypothesis, the theory that all human origin was from a single region of the earth; he reached this conclusion by reasoning from linguistic evolution (Jones, 1789). This theory is evidence of his thinking on the topic of the evolution of Man. Joshua Steele's disagreement, and subsequent correspondence, with Monboddo over details of the \\"melody and measure of speech\\" resulted in Steele's Prosodia Rationalis, a foundational work both in phonetics and in the analysis of verse rhythm. Evolutionary theorist Monboddo analysed man's relation to other species Monboddo is considered by some scholars as a precursive thinker in the theory of evolution. However, some modern evolutionary historians do not give Monboddo an equally high standing in the influence of history of evolutionary thought. :\\"Monboddo: Scottish jurist and pioneer anthropologist who explored the origins of language and society and anticipated principles of Darwinian evolution.\\" :\\"With some wavering, he extended Rousseau's doctrine of the identity of species of man and the chimp into the hypothesis of common descent of all the anthropoids, and suggested by implication a general law of evolution.\\" Lovejoy. Charles Neaves, one of Monboddo's successors on the high court of Scotland, believed that proper credit was not given to Monboddo in evolutionary theory development. Neaves wrote in verse: Though Darwin now proclaims the law And spreads it far abroad, O! The man that first the secret saw Was honest old Monboddo. The architect precedence takes Of him that bears the hod, O! So up and at them, Land of Cakes, We'll vindicate Monboddo. Erasmus Darwin notes Monboddo's work in his publications (Darwin 1803). Later writers consider Monboddo's analysis as precursive to the theory of Evolution. Whether Charles Darwin read Monboddo is not certain. Monboddo debated with Buffon regarding man's relationship to other primates. Charles Darwin did not mention Monboddo, but commented on Buffon: \\"the first author who in modern times has treated [evolution] in a scientific spirit was Buffon\\". Buffon thought that man was a species unrelated to lower primates, but Monboddo rejected Buffon's analysis and argued that the anthropoidal ape must be related to the species of man: he sometimes referred to the anthropoidal ape as the \\"brother of man\\". Monboddo suffered a setback, in his standing on evolutionary thought, because he stated at one time that men had caudal appendages (tails); some historians failed to take him very seriously after that remark, even though Monboddo was known to bait his critics with preposterous sayings. Bailey's The Holly and the Horn states that \\"Charles Darwin was to some degree influenced by the theories of Monboddo, who deserves the title of Evolutionist more than that of Eccentric.\\" Henderson says: :\\"He [Monboddo] was a minor celebrity in Edinburgh because he was considered to be very eccentric. But he actually came up with the idea that men may have evolved instead of being created by God. His views were dismissed because people thought he was mad, and in those days it was a very controversial view to hold. But he felt it was a logical possibility and it caused him a great deal of consternation. He actually did not want to believe the theory because he was a very religious person.\\" Monboddo may be the first person to associate language skills evolving from primates and continuing to evolve in early humans (Monboddo, 1773). He wrote about how the language capability has altered over time in the form not only of skills but physical form of the sound producing organs (mouth, vocal cords, tongue, throat), suggesting he had formed the concept of evolutionary adaptive change. Left to right: Lord Kames, Hugo Arnot and Lord Monboddo, by John Kay He also elaborates on the advantages created by the adaptive change of primates to their environment and even to the evolving complexity of primate social structures. In 1772 in a letter to James Harris, Monboddo articulated that his theory of language evolution (Harris 1772) was simply a part of the manner that man had advanced from the lower animals, a clear precedent of evolutionary thought. Furthermore, he established a detailed theory of how man adaptively acquired language to cope better with his environment and social needs. He argued that the development of language was linked to a procession of events: first developing use of tools, then social structures and finally language. This concept was quite striking for his era, because it departed from the classical religious thinking that man was created instantaneously and language revealed by God. In fact, Monboddo was deeply religious and pointed out that the creation events were probably simply allegories and did not dispute that the universe was created by God. Monboddo was a vigorous opponent of other scientific thinking that philosophically questioned the role of God (see Monboddo's prolific diatribes on Newton's theories). As an agriculturist and horse-breeder, Monboddo was quite aware of the significance of selective breeding and even transferred this breeding theory to communications he had with James Boswell in Boswell's selection of a mate. Monboddo has stated in his own works that degenerative qualities can be inherited by successive generations and that by selective choice of mates, creatures can improve the next generation in a biological sense. This suggests that Monboddo understood the role of natural processes in evolution; artificial selection was the starting-point for many of the proto-evolutionary thinkers, and for Darwin himself. Monboddo struggled with how to \\"get man from an animal\\" without divine intervention. This is typical of the kind of thinking which is called deist. He developed an entire theory of language evolution around the Egyptian civilisation to assist in his understanding of how man descended from animals, since he explained the flowering of language upon the spinoff of the Egyptians imparting language skills to other cultures. Monboddo cast early humans as wild, solitary, herbivorous quadrupeds. He believed that contemporary people suffered many diseases because they were removed from the environmental state of being unclothed and exposed to extreme swings in climate. Burnett wrote of numerous cultures (mostly based upon accounts of explorers); for example, he described \\"insensibles\\" and \\"wood eaters\\" in Of the Origin and Progress of Language. He was fascinated by the nature of these peoples' language development and also how they fit into the evolutionary scheme. Against all this, Monboddo's contribution to evolution is today regarded by historians of evolution as being notable. Bowler acknowledges his argument that apes might represent the earliest form of humanity (Monboddo 1774), but continues: :\\"He [Monboddo] regarded humans (including savages and apes) as quite distinct from the rest of the animal kingdom. The first suggestion that the human species was descended via the apes from the lower animals did not come until Lamarck's Philosophie Zoologique of 1809.\\" Charles Dickens knew of Monboddo and wrote in his novel, Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit about \\"(...) the Manboddo doctrine touching the probability of the human race having once been monkeys\\". This is significant because Martin Chuzzlewit was published decades before Darwin wrote his theory of evolution. The history of the theory of evolution is a relatively modern field of scholarship. Metaphysics In Antient Metaphysics, Burnett claimed that man is gradually elevating himself from the animal condition to a state in which mind acts independently of the body. He was a strong supporter of Aristotle in his concepts of Prime Mover. Much effort was devoted to crediting Isaac Newton with brilliant discoveries in the Laws of Motion, while defending the power of the mind as outlined by Aristotle. His analysis was further complicated by his recurring need to assure that Newton did not obviate the presence of God. Nudism Monboddo was a pioneer in regard to many modern ideas and had already in the eighteenth century realized the value of \\"air-baths\\" (the familiar term which he invented) to mental and physical health. In his writings Monboddo argued against clothes as unnatural and undesirable from every point of view for both mind and body. Monboddo \\"awaked every morning at four, and then for his health got up and walked in his room naked, with the window open, which he called taking an air bath.\\" When nudism was first brought into fashion with much enthusiasm in Germany as Freik√∂rperkultur early in the twentieth century Monboddo was regarded as a pioneer, and in 1913 a Monboddo Bund was established in Berlin, for the harmonious culture of body and mind. Eccentricity Burnett was widely known to be an eccentric. Habitually he rode on horseback between Edinburgh and London instead of journeying by carriage. Another time after a decision went against him regarding the value of a horse, he refused to sit with the other judges and assumed a seat below the bench with the court clerks. When Burnett was visiting the Court of King's Bench in London in 1787, part of the floor of the courtroom started to collapse. People rushed out of the building but Burnett who, at the age of 71, was partially deaf and shortsighted, was the only one not to move. When he was later asked for a reason, he stated that he thought it was \\"an annual ceremony, with which, as an alien, he had nothing to do\\". Burnett in his earlier years suggested that the orangutan was a form of man, although some analysts think that some of his presentation was designed to entice his critics into debate. Lord Monboddo, a caricature by John Kay The orangutan was at this time a generic term for all types of apes. The Swedish explorer whose evidence Burnett accepted was a naval officer who had viewed a group of monkeys and thought they were human. Burnett may simply have taken the view that it was reasonable for people to assume the things they do and the word of a naval officer trained to give accurate reports was a credible source. Burnett was indeed responsible for changing the classical definition of man as a creature of reason to a creature capable of achieving reason, although he viewed this process as one slow and difficult to achieve. At one time he said that humans must have all been born with tails, which were removed by midwives at birth. His contemporaries ridiculed his views, and by 1773 he had retracted this opinion (Pringle 1773). Some later commentators have seen him as anticipating evolutionary theory. He appeared to argue that animal species adapted and changed to survive, and his observations on the progression of primates to man amounted to some kind of concept of evolution. Burnett also examined feral children and was the only thinker of his day to accept them as human rather than monsters. He viewed in these children the ability to achieve reason. He identified the orangutan as human, as his sources indicated it was capable of experiencing shame. In popular culture In Thomas Love Peacock's 1817 novel Melincourt, an orangutan punningly named \\"Sir Oran Haut-Ton\\" becomes a candidate for British Parliament based on Monboddo's theories. Charles Dickens, in his novel Martin Chuzzlewit, refers to \\"the Manboddo doctrine touching the probability of the human race having once been monkeys\\". In his 1981 dystopian novel Lanark, Alasdair Gray names the head of the mysterious Institute Lord Monboddo. He makes the connection explicit in a marginal note, adding that it is not a literal depiction. Lord Monboddo's descendant, Jamie Burnett of Leys, has sponsored a stage work Monboddo ‚Äì The Musical which is a biographical re-enactment of the life of his ancestor. It received a first run at Aberdeen Arts Centre in September 2010. In her short story \\"The Monboddo Ape Boy\\", Lillian de la Torre depicted a slightly fictionalised Monboddo meeting Samuel Johnson, and being presented with a supposed \\"wild boy\\".

He was called \\"the brightest\\" of the \\"Bright Young People\\". Early life The Wyndham Sisters, by John Singer Sargent, 1899 (Metropolitan Museum) He was born into British nobility, the youngest son of a Scottish peer, Edward Tennant, 1st Baron Glenconner, and the former Pamela Wyndham, one of the Wyndham sisters and of The Souls clique. His mother was also a cousin of Lord Alfred Douglas (1870‚Äì1945), Oscar Wilde's lover and a sonneteer. On his father's death, Tennant's mother married Lord Grey, a fellow bird-lover. Tennant's eldest brother Edward ‚Äì \\"Bim\\" ‚Äì was killed in the First World War. His elder brother David Tennant founded the Gargoyle Club in Soho. =Social set= During the 1920s and 1930s, Tennant was an important member ‚Äì the \\"Brightest\\", it is said ‚Äì of the \\"Bright Young People\\". His friends included Rex Whistler, Cecil Beaton, the Sitwells, Lady Diana Manners and the Mitford girls. He is widely considered to be the model for Cedric Hampton in Nancy Mitford's novel Love in a Cold Climate, one of the inspirations for Lord Sebastian Flyte in Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, and a model for the Hon. Miles Malpractice in some of Waugh's other novels. Writing For most of his life, Tennant tried to start or finish a novel ‚Äì Lascar: A Story You Must Forget. It is popularly believed that he spent the last 17 years of his life in bed at his family manor at Wilsford cum Lake, Wiltshire, which he had redecorated by Syrie Maugham. Though undoubtedly idle, he was not truly lethargic: he made several visits to the United States and Italy, and struck up many new friendships. His later reputation as a recluse became increasingly true only towards the last years of his life. Yet even then, his life was not uneventful: he became landlord to V. S. Naipaul, who immortalised Tennant in his novel The Enigma of Arrival. Personal life During the 1920s and 1930s Tennant had a sexual affair with the poet Siegfried Sassoon. Prior to this he had proposed to a friend, Elizabeth Lowndes, but had been rejected. (Philip Hoare relates how Tennant discussed plans with Lowndes about bringing his nanny with them on their honeymoon.) His relationship with Sassoon, however, was to be his most important: it lasted some four years before Tennant off-handedly put an abrupt end to it. Sassoon was reportedly depressed afterwards for three months, but recovered to marry in 1933 and become a father in 1936. When Tennant died in 1987, he had far outlived most of his contemporaries. A large archive of his letters, scrapbooks, personal ephemera and artworks is held in The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art & Natural History in Hackney, London.  In popular culture  The character of Cedric Hampton in the novel Love in a Cold Climate is based on Tennant. The character of Miles Malpractice in the novel Vile Bodies is based on Tennant. Lord Sebastian Flyte, a character in the novel Brideshead Revisited, is partly based on Tennant.

On May 18, 1864, two New York City newspapers, the New York World and the New York Journal of Commerce, published a story that President Abraham Lincoln had issued a proclamation of conscription of 400,000 more men into the Union army. At the time, there were fierce battles taking place between Union and Confederate troops in Virginia and the public took it to mean that the war was not going well for the Union. Share prices fell on the New York Stock Exchange when investors began to buy gold, and its value increased 10%. During the day a number of people‚Äîone of them former Union commander General George McClellan‚Äîbecame suspicious of the fact that the proclamation had been published in just two newspapers, and went to the offices of the Journal to determine the source. Editors of the paper showed them an Associated Press dispatch they had received early in the morning. Before noon, the Associated Press issued a statement that the dispatch had not come from them, and at 12:30 p.m. the State Department in Washington, D.C. sent a telegram to verify that the proclamation was \\"an absolute forgery\\". By then, however, the stock market had already been affected. Further investigation revealed that the dispatches had been delivered by a young courier just after the night editors had gone home. The timing had been perfect: the night foreman had had to make a decision as to whether to include the proclamation in the next day's paper or not. Night foremen in various other newspapers had tried to verify the message, and when they found out that not every paper had received the message, they decided to delay it pending further proof. Only foremen for the World and Journal of Commerce had added it. President Lincoln was enraged when he heard about the case: he gave an order to close the two papers down and had their editors arrested for suspicion of complicity. Soldiers seized the two offices and, for some reason, the office of the Independent Telegraph Line. Lincoln eventually had the editors released. Detectives tracked down the culprits. They found the messengers and questioned them. On May 21 they arrested Francis Mallison, a reporter for the Brooklyn Eagle who informed on his city editor Joseph Howard, Jr., who was also arrested. Howard came quietly and confessed. Howard had bought gold on margin May 17, and started the ruse because he knew that any news of a prolongation of the war would cause a rise in the price of gold when investors wanted to transfer their savings elsewhere. He had forged the two AP dispatches, and sent them to various city newspapers in an appropriate time. The next day, during the furor, he had sold his investment and profited immensely. Howard spent only three months in prison and was released on August 22, 1864. With perfect irony, at that time Lincoln had to issue a call for 500,000 more soldiers.

She toured with showman P. T. Barnum as a circus attraction. Whether the cause of her condition was hirsutism or an unrelated genetic condition that affects children of both sexes and continues into adult years is unknown. Many photographers, including Mathew Brady, took her portraits during her lifetime, which were widely distributed. As an adult, Jones became the country's top \\"bearded lady\\" and acted as a spokesperson for Barnum's \\"Freaks\\", a word she tried to abolish from the business. Jones married Richard Elliot in 1881, but divorced him in 1895 for her childhood sweetheart William Donovan, who died, leaving Jones a widow. In 1902, Jones died in Brooklyn of tuberculosis.  Early life  Jones was born in Marion, Virginia, the county seat of Smyth County, in the southwestern end of the Commonwealth, on July 14, 1865. When Jones joined Barnum's exhibition as a child of only nine months, Jones' parents received a $150-a-week salary. She was billed as a new \\"infant Esau\\". By the age of five, she had a mustache and sideburns, beard and became well known as the \\"Bearded Girl\\". Photographer Mathew Brady took Jones' portrait as a child in 1865. A number of additional portraits were taken of Jones during her lifetime and were widely distributed. In an incident which may have been one of Barnum's publicity stunts, a New York phrenologist kidnapped Jones when she was a young child. Barnum and the police found her exhibited in a church fair. When the man claimed the child as his, the matter went to court. The judge had Jones separated from the others before it was her time to testify. When the child was taken to the courtroom, she went straight to her parents when she saw them. The judge declared the case closed.  References   External links  *The Human Marvels Biography, J.

She has been described by contemporaries as \\"the most illustrious and celebrated bearded lady in France\\" and \\"the perfect example of a bearded lady\\".  Early life  Cl√©mentine Delait was born in 1865 in Thaon-les-Vosges, in Lorraine, France. At the age of 20 she married Paul Delait, a local baker, with who she opened a caf√© in town. According to later accounts, Cl√©mentine Delait was hirsute from an early age, but shaved regularly. This changed in 1900, when she visited a carnival and saw a bearded woman with an unimpressive stubble and boasted that she could grow a better beard herself. Her husband bet 500 francs to back her. The bet attracted many more customers to the Delaits' caf√© and they changed the name to Le Caf√© de La Femme √† Barbe, \\"The caf√© of the Bearded Woman\\".  Fame  Delait began selling photographs and postcards of herself and became something of a celebrity. She began touring Europe, attracting great crowds in Paris and London. Her touring intensified after she became a widow in 1926. In 1900 she took part in much publicized stunt during which she entered a lion cage and played cards with the lion tamer while inside, as legend has it, scaring the lions in the process. In 1904 she received special permission from the authorities to wear men's clothes at heir leisure, at a time when it was illegal for women to wear masculine garb. By all accounts, she was very proud of her beard and took great care of it. Charles Grossier, her former barber, claimed that Delait would \\"watch him like a hawk\\" whenever he would be trimming her beard. Grossier visited her three time per week to wash her beard with a special shampoo and claimed that \\"she took care of that beard, she washed it, she clucked over, she brushed it every day\\".

A similar mark has a variety of unrelated uses in programming, mathematics and other contexts. The symbol was included in typewriter and computer keyboards so that circumflex accents could be overprinted on letters (as in ). This facility is not provided as standard on typical US keyboard settings and so the character became reused in computer languages for many other purposes. The misnomer \\"caret\\" is frequently applied to the circumflex symbol in that context, because of its similarity to the proofreading mark for insertion. This page will call this symbol a \\"circumflex\\" to distinguish it from a true caret. This circumflex is not to be confused with other chevron-shaped characters, such as the circumflex accent, the turned v or the logical AND, which may occasionally be called carets. Uses =Proofreading mark= The caret was originally and continues to be used in handwritten form as a proofreading mark to indicate where a punctuation mark, word, or phrase should be inserted into a document. The term comes from the Latin , \\"it lacks\\", from , \\"to lack; to be separated from; to be free from\\". The caret symbol is written below the line of text for a line- level punctuation mark, such as a comma, or above the line as an inverted caret (cf. ) for a higher character, such as an apostrophe; the material to be inserted may be placed inside the caret, in the margin, or above the line.

It can signify exponentiation, the bitwise XOR operator, string concatenation, and control characters in caret notation, among other uses. In regular expressions, the circumflex is used to match the beginning of a string or line; if it begins a character class, then the inverse of the class is to be matched. ANSI C can transcribe the circumflex in the form of the trigraph \`??'\`, as the character was originally not available in all character sets and keyboards. C++ additionally supports tokens like \`xor\` (for \`^\`) and \`xor_eq\` (for \`^=\`) to avoid the character altogether. RFC 1345 recommends to transcribe the character as digraph \`'>\` when required.RFC 1345 Pascal uses the circumflex for declaring and dereferencing pointers. In Smalltalk, the circumflex is the method return statement. In C++/CLI, .NET reference types are accessed through a handle using the \`ClassName^\` syntax. In Apple's C extensions for Mac OS X and iOS, circumflex are used to create blocks and to denote block types. Go uses it as a bitwise NOT operator. Node.js uses the circumflex in package.json files to signify dependency resolution behavior being used for each particular dependency. In the case of Node.js, a circumflex allows any kind of update, unless it is seen as a \\"major\\" update as defined by semver.Caret ranges in node.js =Surrogate symbol for superscript and exponentiation= In mathematics, the circumflex can signify exponentiation (\`3^5\` for ), where the usual superscript is not readily usable (as on some graphing calculators). It is also used to indicate a superscript in TeX typesetting. As Isaac Asimov described it in his 1974 \\"Skewered!\\" essay (on Skewes' number), \\"I make the exponent a figure of normal size and it is as though it is being held up by a lever, and its added weight when its size grows bends the lever down.\\" The use of the circumflex for exponentiation can be traced back to ALGOL 60, which expressed the exponentiation operator as an upward-pointing arrow, intended to evoke the superscript notation common in mathematics. The upward-pointing arrow is now used to signify hyperoperations in Knuth's up-arrow notation. =Escape character= Often seen as caret notation to show control characters, for instance means the control character with value 1. The command-line interpreter, cmd.exe, of Windows uses the circumflex to escape reserved characters (most other shells use the backslash). For instance to pass a less-than sign as an argument to a program you type . =Ordinal indicator= In Italian, the circumflex is sometimes used in a similar manner to the ordinal indicator, most noticeably on tickets from Trenitalia, the primary operator of trains within Italy, and Rome's ATAC public transit system. On Trenitalia tickets, the travel class is often written as 1^ or 2^, meaning first class or second class respectively. This is due to the lack of the feminine ordinal indicator used in Italian in the (pre- Unicode) ISO Latin 1 character set (the masculine ordinal indicator is usually replaced by the degree sign when extended characters are not available or in less accurate typesetting). =Upwards-pointing arrow= In internet forums, social networking sites such as Facebook, or in online chats, a circumflex or a series of them may be used beneath or after the post of one user by another user. In this usage, the circumflex represents an upwards-pointing arrow meaning for readers, posters or the original post (OP) to see the above line/post, and in addition to the arrow usage, can also mean that the user who posted the ^ agrees with the above post. Multiple circumflexes may indicate the comment is replying to or relating to the post above that correlates with the number of circumflexes used, or to \\"underscore\\" the correct portion of the previous post, or may simply be used for emphasis. A similar use has been adopted by programming language compilers such as Java compiler to point out where a compilation error has occurred. In addition to indicating the line number and column number of the error location, the compiler prints out the faulty line of code and uses a single circumflex on the next line, padded by spaces, to give a visual indication of the error location. The circumflex acts as an upwards-pointing arrow in the text-based print out of the error details. Historic computer systems encoding The original 1963 version of the ASCII standard reserved the code point 5Ehex for an up-arrow. However, the 1965 ECMA-6 standard replaced the up-arrow with circumflex diacritic and two years later, the second revision of ASCII followed suit. As the early mainframes and minicomputers largely used teleprinters as output devices, it was possible to print the circumflex above a letter when needed. With the proliferation of monitors, however, this was seen insufficient, and precomposed characters, with the diacritic included, were instead introduced into appended character sets, such as Latin-1 and subsequently Unicode. The original circumflex character was left for other purposes, and as it did not need to fit above a letter anymore, it became larger in appearance.

Biography Richard Lydekker was born at Tavistock Square in London. His father was Gerard Wolfe Lydekker, a barrister-at-law with Dutch ancestry. The family moved to Harpenden Lodge soon after Richard's birth. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took a first-class in the Natural Science tripos (1872). In 1874 he joined the Geological Survey of India and made studies of the vertebrate palaeontology of northern India (especially Kashmir). He remained in this post until the death of his father in 1881. His main work in India was on the Siwalik palaeofauna; it was published in Palaeontologia Indica. He was responsible for the cataloguing of the fossil mammals, reptiles and birds in the Natural History Museum (10 vols., 1891). He named a variety of taxa including the golden-bellied mangabey; as a taxon authority he is named simply as \\"Lydekker\\". Biogeography He was influential in the science of biogeography. In 1895 he delineated the biogeographical boundary through Indonesia, known as Lydekker's Line, that separates Wallacea on the west from Australia-New Guinea on the east. It follows the edge of the Sahul Shelf, an area from New Guinea to Australia of shallow water with the Aru Islands on its edge. Along with Wallace's Line and Huxley's Line it indicates the definite effect of geology on the biogeography of the region, something not seen so clearly in other parts of the world. First cuckoo Lydekker attracted amused public attention with a pair of letters to The Times in 1913, when he wrote on 6 February that he had heard a cuckoo, contrary to Yarrell's History of British Birds which doubted the bird arrived before April. Six days later on 12 February 1913, he wrote again, confessing that \\"the note was uttered by a bricklayer's labourer\\". Letters about the first cuckoo became a tradition in the newspaper. Awards He received the Lyell Medal from the Geological Society of London in 1902. Works * Catalogue of the Fossil Mammalia in the British Museum (Natural History), 5 vols.

In her only film role in Tod Browning's cult classic Freaks, using the sideshow stage name Olga Roderick, she was billed as the \\"Bearded Lady\\".  Biography  Jane Barnell was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, to George Barnell, a Russian Jewish itinerant wagon maker, and his wife, a woman of Irish and Catawban ancestry. When she applied for her social security card in May 1939, she gave her parents as George Barnell and Nancy Shaw. Her mother's name is not mentioned in the interviews she gave. She was their second child, and she had three sisters and two brothers. She was named after her maternal grandmother. Her mother was from York County, South Carolina. By two years of age, she was capable of growing a beard. Her mother took her to hoodoo doctors and other folk healers to remove her condition. In 1875, Barnell's mother sold the 4-year-old Jane to the Great Orient Family Circus and Menagerie while her father was away on business in Baltimore. The circus consisted of the Muslim woman who worked as manager, two of her daughters who danced, and three sons who juggled and were tight rope walkers. Jane toured with the circus for several months around the South before the circus went to New Orleans, left for Europe, and took her with them. In Europe the circus toured with a German circus. She fell ill with typhoid fever in Berlin. She was placed in a charity hospital and later in an orphanage. She was later found by her father by the time she was five. He had either tracked the circus from the Carolinas to Germany, or the woman who ran the circus had the Berlin police contact the sheriff of Wilmington. After that incident, Barnell was placed in the care of her Catawban grandmother who lived in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. She began to shave in order to conceal her condition. Her grandmother told her stories about Florence Nightingale, which inspired her to work as a student nurse in the old city hospital at Wilmington when she turned 17. She worked there for about a year until an unpleasant incident occurred that made her believe she would never have a normal life. She returned to her grandmother's farm. In spring 1892 she met a circus performer Professor William Heckler who talked her into stopping shaving and got her employment with John Robinson's Circus. She tried several stage names before eventually settling on Lady Olga Roderick. At that time her beard was 13 inches long. She went back to North Carolina every winter until her grandmother died in 1899. She worked with the Robinson circus for fourteen years. At some point during her life, Barnell worked as a trapeze artist before having a railroad accident that ended her career. She then became a commercial photographer. Barnell toured for a time with a number of circuses, including the Ringling Brothers circus, and later joined Hubert's Museum in Times Square, New York City. She appeared in a Tod Browning's Freaks (1932) which, according to the DVD documentary,Freaks: The Sideshow Cinema, 2004 left her unhappy with the overall portrayal of the sideshow performers in the film. In April 1935, she was working at the Ringling Brothers' sideshow at Madison Square Garden. In 1940, she was interviewed by Joseph Mitchell for an article for The New Yorker. His interview is one of the few sources that exists about her life. Her date and place of death has been erroneously reported online as October 26, 1951. That date comes from some researchers confusing her death with that of a Susan Jane Barnell. When approached by Diane Arbus about information regarding her death, Joseph Mitchell verified her passing. Barnell died on July 21, 1945 in Manhattan. Her remains were cremated by the New York and New Jersey Cremation Company.  Personal life  Barnell was married four times. Her first marriage was to a German musician who played in the band for John Robinson's Circus. She had two children with him. Her husband and their two children died within several years. Her second husband was a balloonist who was killed months after their marriage. Her third marriage was to an alcoholic whom she divorced. Her last marriage, in 1931, was to her manager Thomas O'Boyle, an orphan ex-circus clown and a sideshow talker for Hubert's Dime Museum. She had little contact with her family after she became a performer. She believed they thought she was a disgrace. By 1940, she claimed to have not seen her siblings in 22 years and believed them to be dead. One of her sisters worked as a nurse helping blind Chinese children. In April 1935, she gave a slightly different account of her personal life when interviewed by Ruth McKenney. She claimed that she had been married thrice; the first time when she was fourteen; the second time when she was nineteen; and then to her husband of four years Thomas O'Boyle.

During World War II, the monsignor was responsible for saving 6,500 Allied soldiers and Jews. His ability to evade the traps set by the German Gestapo and Sicherheitsdienst (SD), earned O'Flaherty the nickname \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican\\". Early life Shortly after Hugh O'Flaherty's birth in Lisrobin, Kiskeam, County Cork, his parents, James and Margaret, moved to Killarney. The family lived on the golf course where James O'Flaherty worked as a steward.Fleming 2008, pp. 14‚Äì15 By his late teens, young O'Flaherty had a scratch handicap and a scholarship to a teacher training college. However, in 1918 he enrolled at Mungret College, a Jesuit college in County Limerick dedicated to preparing young men for missionary priesthood.Fleming 2008, p. 15 Normally, students ranged from 14 to 18 years of age. At the time when O'Flaherty came in, he was a little older than most of the students, about 20. The college allowed for some older people to come in if they had been accepted by a bishop who would pay for them. O'Flaherty's sponsor was the Bishop of Cape Town, Cornelius O'Reilly, in whose diocese he would be posted after ordination, a big step for a young man who had never set foot outside of Munster. At the time when O'Flaherty was in Mungret, the Irish War for Independence was ongoing. He was posted to Rome in 1922 to finish his studies and was ordained on 20 December 1925. He never joined his diocese however, staying to work for the Holy See and serving as a Vatican diplomat in Egypt, Haiti, Santo Domingo, and Czechoslovakia. In 1934, he was appointed a papal chamberlain with the title of Monsignor. World War II In the early years of World War II, the Very Rev. Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty (as he was then) toured prisoner of war (POW) camps in Italy and tried to find out about prisoners who had been reported missing in action. If he found them alive, he tried to reassure their families through Radio Vatican. When Mussolini was removed from power by the King in 1943, thousands of Allied POWs were released; however, when Germany imposed an occupation over Italy, they were in danger of recapture. Some of them, remembering visits by O'Flaherty, reached Rome and asked him for help. Others went to the Irish embassy to the Holy See, the only English-speaking embassy to remain open in Rome during the war. Delia Murphy, who was the wife of Thomas J. Kiernan, the Irish ambassador (and, in her day, a well-known ballad singer), was one of those who helped O'Flaherty. Monsignor O'Flaherty did not wait for permission from his superiors. He recruited the help of other priests (including two young New Zealanders, Fathers Owen Snedden and John Flanagan), two agents working for the Free French, Fran√ßois de Vial and Yves Debroise, Communists and a Swiss count. One of his aides was British Major Sam Derry, a POW escapee. Derry along with British officers and escaped POWs Lieutenants Furman and Simpson, and Captain Byrnes, a Canadian, were responsible for the security and operational organisation. O'Flaherty also kept contact with Sir D'Arcy Osborne, British Ambassador to the Holy See, and his butler John May (whom O'Flaherty described as \\"a genius ... the most magnificent scrounger\\"). O'Flaherty and his allies concealed 4,000 escapees, mainly Allied soldiers and Jews, in flats, farms and convents. One of the first hideouts was beside the local SS headquarters. O'Flaherty and Derry coordinated all this from his room at the Collegio Teutonico.MacDonald, Sarah. \\"Mgr Hugh O‚ÄôFlaherty ‚Äì The Vatican Pimpernel\\", The Tablet, June 6, 2019 When outside the Vatican, O'Flaherty wore various disguises. The German occupiers tried to stop him and eventually they found out that the leader of the network was a priest. SS attempts to assassinate him failed. They learned his identity, but could not arrest him inside the Vatican. When the German ambassador revealed this to O'Flaherty, he began to meet his contacts on the stairs of St. Peter's Basilica. Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Herbert Kappler, the head of the SS Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo in Rome, learned of O'Flaherty's actions; he ordered a white line painted on the pavement at the opening of St. Peter's Square (signifying the border between Vatican City and Italy), stating that the priest would be killed if he crossed it. Pietro Koch, head of the Banda Koch, a special task force charged with hunting down partisans and rounding up deportees for the Germans, often spoke of his intention to torture O'Flaherty before executing him if he ever fell into his hands. Several others, including priests, nuns and lay people, worked in secret with O'Flaherty, and even hid refugees in their own private homes around Rome. Among these were the Augustinian Maltese Fathers Egidio Galea, Aurelio Borg and Ugolino Gatt, the Dutch Augustinian Father Anselmus Musters and Brother Robert Pace of the Brothers of Christian Schools. Another person who contributed significantly to this operation was the Malta-born widow Chetta Chevalier who hid some refugees in her house with her children, and escaped detection. Jewish religious services were conducted in the Basilica di San Clemente, which was under Irish diplomatic protection, under a painting of Tobias. When the Allies arrived in Rome in June 1944, 6,425 of the escapees were still alive. O'Flaherty demanded that German prisoners be treated properly as well. He took a plane to South Africa to meet Italian POWs and to Jerusalem to visit Jewish refugees. Of the 9,700 Jews in Rome, 1,007 had been shipped to Auschwitz. The rest were hidden, over 5,000 of them by the Church ‚àí 300 in Castel Gandolfo, 200 or 400 (estimates vary) as \\"members\\" of the Palatine Guard and some 1,500 in monasteries, convents and colleges. The remaining 3,700 were hidden in private homes.Hugh O'Flaherty profile at rootsweb.com retrieved 9 December 2006 At the time of the liberation of Rome, O'Flaherty's and Derry's organisation was caring for 3,925 escapees and men who had succeeded in evading arrest. Of these 1,695 were British, 896 South African, 429 Russian, 425 Greek and 185 American. The remainder were from 20 different nations. This does not include Jews and sundry other men and women who were in O'Flaherty's personal care. Memorial to Monsignor O'Flaherty located in Killarney, Ireland. Post-war After the war Monsignor O'Flaherty received a number of awards, including appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) \\"for services to the Forces in Italy\\" and the US Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm. He was also honoured by Canada and Australia. He refused to use the lifetime pension that Italy had given him. In 1953 he was promoted to domestic prelate. In the 1950s, the Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, in the form proposed by the now-canonised Mary Faustina Kowalska, was under a ban from the Vatican. It was O'Flaherty who, as Notary, signed the document that notified Catholics of the ban.Cf. The Holy See's official journal Acta Apostolicae Sedis Volume 51, p. 271. He was the first Irishman named Notary of the Holy Office. O'Flaherty regularly visited his old nemesis Herbert Kappler (the former SS chief in Rome), in prison, month after month, being Kappler's only visitor. In 1959, Kappler converted to Catholicism and was baptised by O'Flaherty. In 1960, O'Flaherty suffered a serious stroke during Mass and was forced to return to Ireland. Shortly before his first stroke in 1960, he was due to be confirmed as the Papal Nuncio to Tanzania. He moved to Cahersiveen to live with his sister, at whose home he died on 30 October 1963, aged 65. He was buried in the cemetery of the Daniel O'Connell Memorial Church in Cahersiveen. There is a monument in Killarney town and a grove of trees dedicated to his memory in the Killarney National Park. Mural of Monsignor O'Flaherty in Killarney, Ireland Some sources incorrectly state that, in 2003, he became the first Irish person honoured as Righteous Among the Nations by the State of Israel. However, according to the list of those honoured, this is not the case.http://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/statistics.html Names of Righteous by Countryhttp://www.yadvashem.org/yv/pdf-drupal/ireland.pdf Righteous Among the Nations: IrelandApplication to have him added to the rolls is still in progress. Dramatization O'Flaherty was portrayed by Gregory Peck in the 1983 television film, The Scarlet and the Black, which follows the exploits of O'Flaherty from the German occupation of Rome to its liberation by the Allies. He was also the second principal character in a radio play by Robin Glendinning on Kappler's time seeking asylum in the Vatican, titled The Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican, which was first broadcast on 30 November 2006 on Radio 4, with Wolf Kahler as Kappler. Killarney-born actor and playwright Donal Courtney penned a new one-man play entitled \\"God has no Country\\", which he premi√®red in Killarney as part of the Hugh O Flaherty memorial celebrations for 3 nights in October 2013. Courtney portrays the monsignor during the wartime years in German-occupied Rome; the story is told from the monsignor's point of view and is a study of the torment and difficulty in the decisions he undertook in his fight for justice. Television The Irish-language television station TG4 broadcast a 51-minute documentary on Monsignor O'Flaherty in 2008. It is available (in mixed Irish/English with English subtitles) on a region-free DVD entitled The Pimpernel of the Vatican ‚Äì The Amazing Story of Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty.

In a ghost-written book called The Long Walk, he claimed that in 1941 he and six others had escaped from a Siberian Gulag camp and begun a long journey south on foot (about ), supposedly travelling through the Gobi Desert, Tibet, and the Himalayas before finally reaching British India in the winter of 1942. In 2006 the BBC released a report based on former Soviet records, including statements written by Rawicz himself, showing that Rawicz had been released as part of the 1942 general amnesty of Poles in the USSR and subsequently transported across the Caspian Sea to a refugee camp in Iran, and hence that his escape to India never occurred. In May 2009, Witold Gli≈Ñski, a Polish World War II veteran living in the UK, came forward to claim that the story of Rawicz was true, but was actually an account of what happened to him, not Rawicz. Gli≈Ñski's claims have been severely questioned by various sources.–°–∫—Ä–∞–¥–∑–µ–Ω–∞–µ –∂—ã—Ü—Ü—ë –í—ñ—Ç–∞–ª—å–¥–∞ –ì–ª—ñ–Ω—Å–∫–∞–≥–∞ Rupert Mayne, a British intelligence officer in wartime India, claimed to his son to have interviewed three emaciated men in Calcutta in 1942, who claimed to have escaped from Siberia. According to his son, Mayne always believed their story was the same as that of The Long Walk--but telling the story decades later, his son could not remember their names or any details.Hugh Levinson, \\"Walking the talk?\\" Monday, 30 October 2006, BBC News, UK Early life and army career S≈Çawomir Rawicz was born on 1 September 1915 in Pinsk, the son of a landowner. He received private primary education and went on to study architecture in 1932. In 1937 he joined the Polish Army Reserve and underwent the cadet officer school. In July 1939 he married Vera, his first wife. She went missing during World War II. According to his account, when Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union defeated Poland, Rawicz returned home, where the NKVD arrested him on 19 November 1939. He was taken to Minsk, then sent to Kharkiv for interrogation, then to the Lubyanka prison in Moscow, where he was put on rigged trial. He was tortured to make him confess to being a spy which initially was unsuccessful. He was sentenced to 25 years of hard labour in a Siberian prison camp, ostensibly for espionage as were thousands of others. Researchers for the BBC Radio program The Long Walk in 2006 unearthed documents indicating that the charge against Rawicz might have been for killing, in the defence of his country, a Soviet NKVD officer.BBC Radio \\"The missing link came through documents discovered by an American researcher, Linda Willis, in Polish and Russian archives. One, in Rawicz's own hand described how he was released from the gulag in 1942, apparently as part of a general amnesty for Polish soldiers. These are backed up by his amnesty document and a permit to travel to rejoin the Polish Army. These papers make it almost impossible to believe that Rawicz escaped, unless there is a case of mistaken identity. However, the name and place and date of birth all match. The documents also show that rather than being imprisoned on trumped-up charges as he claimed, Rawicz was actually sent to the gulag for killing an officer with the NKVD, the forerunner of the Soviet secret police, the KGB.\\"  The Long Walk ‚Äì Escape from the Gulag camp and walk to India  According to the account in the book, Rawicz was transported, alongside thousands of others, to Irkutsk and made to walk to the Gulag Camp 303, which was 650 km south of the Arctic Circle. His labour duties in the camp included the construction of the prisoners' barracks, the manufacture of skis for the Soviet army, and the repair and operation of the camp commandant's radio. In The Long Walk, Rawicz describes how he and six companions escaped from the camp in the middle of a blizzard in 1941 and headed south, avoiding towns.Amazing escapes: illustrated with photographs and prints Thomas G. Gunning ‚Äì 1984 \\"On a snowy night in April of 1941, Slav and six other prisoners ‚Äì Sigmund Makowski, Anastazi Kolemenos, Anton Paluchowicz, Eugene Zaro, Zacharius Marchinkovas, and Smith, an American who never gave his first name ‚Äì crept out of their ...\\" The fugitive party included three Polish soldiers, a Latvian landowner, a Lithuanian architect, and an enigmatic US metro engineer called \\"Mr. Smith\\"; they were later joined by a 17-year-old Polish girl, Kristina.Spectator 1956 \\"They were Smith (50), an American civil engineer; Paluchowicz (41), a sergeant in the Polish cavalry; Makowski (37), an officer of the Polish Frontier Force; Zaro (30), 'a Yugoslav, I think'; Marchinkovas (28), a Lithuanian architect;\\"The Economist 1956 \\"Kolemenos, the fourteen stone Latvian landowner, \\"a kind and helpful giant of a man \\"; Makowski, the precise Polish army captain, Paluchowicz, \\" tough, toothless, devout, old Paluchowicz,\\" the sergeant of Polish cavalry ; Zaro, the Jugoslav clerk and resilient humorist of the party ; Marchinkovas, the Lithuanian architect\\" They journeyed from Siberia to India crossing the Gobi Desert and Himalayas.

According to the book, four survivors of the 11-month trek reached British India around March 1942 and stumbled upon a Gurkha patrol.Life Is... p101 Ray Rouse ‚Äì 2007 \\"That decision meant walking four thousand miles under extremely difficult conditions in order to gain freedom. Marchinkovas, Makowski, and Paluchowicz failed the test. Rawicz, Smith, Kolemenos, and Zaro passed it and lived.\\" They were taken to a hospital in Calcutta. Towards the end of the book, Mr. Smith asked Rawicz about his future. Rawicz told Smith he would rejoin the Polish army. Once released from the hospital, the survivors went their own ways. Some were still permanently sick from the hardships of the Long Walk.  WWII activities after imprisonment  According to Rawicz, he moved from India to Iraq, then re-entered the Soviet Union in June 1942 and rejoined the Polish Army on 24 July 1942 at Kermini. He then returned to Iraq with Polish troops and moved on to Palestine, where he spent time recovering in a hospital and teaching in a military school. He claimed that General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders had recommended his transfer to Britain for training as a pilot of the Polish Air Forces in Great Britain.  Historical records  Soviet records confirm that Rawicz was a Polish soldier imprisoned in the USSR, but differ from The Long Walk in detail on the reasons for his arrest and the exact places of imprisonment. Polish Army records show that Rawicz left the USSR directly for Iran in 1942, which contradicts the book's storyline. Aside from matters concerning his health, his arrival in Palestine is verified by the records. The story of the escape to India comes from Rawicz himself. According to his son, years after the war Captain Rupert Mayne, an intelligence officer in Calcutta, said that in 1942 he had debriefed three emaciated men claiming to have escaped from a Siberian Gulag camp. Mayne did not provide any further details, did not identify Rawicz as one of the men, and despite extensive subsequent research no hard confirmatory evidence has been found.  Postwar life  After the war he settled in Sandiacre, Nottingham, England, and worked at the Nottingham Design Centre. He married Marjorie Gregory n√©e Needham in 1947; they had five children. In the early 1970s he became a technician at the Architectural Ceramics course at Nottingham Trent University School of Art and Design. A heart attack forced him into early retirement in 1975. He lived a quiet life with his family, giving public talks and answering fan mail, until his death on 5 April 2004. Three weeks after Harold Nicolson reviewed The Long Walk for The Observer, the newspaper published a short article entitled \\"Long Walker\\", in response to readers' questions about Rawicz's postwar life. In addition to the familiar biographical details to 1956, presumably supplied by author or publisher,The Observer article may be based on an interview: \\"About his real name he preserves secrecy. He is about forty, is handsome in a lined and slightly weary-looking kind of way, and is extremely shy and modest. He is very happy in this country, and retains his Polish nationality only because of the hope which Poles often have that one day there will be a Poland to go home to.\\" the article added: \\"About his real name he preserves secrecy\\". The Long Walk The Long Walk was ghost-written by Ronald Downing based on conversations with Rawicz. It was released in the UK in 1956 and has sold over half a million copies worldwide and has been translated into 25 languages. The Readers Book Club edition (1958), and the \\"concise\\" version (ed. S. H. Burton) brought out by Longmans and Green in their Heritage of Literature Series for schools (1960), helped popularise the book. The \\"concise\\" edition went out of print in the late 1980s. The film The Way Back (released in late 2010), directed by Peter Weir, was inspired by the story. Over the years, critics of the book's accuracy have included Peter Fleming (Ian Fleming's brother), Eric Shipton, and Hugh E. Richardson, a British diplomat stationed in Lhasa. Other versions and historical research Various people have researched the veracity of the story. Examples include: *Witold Gli≈Ñski, a Polish survivor of the war, claimed that he was the person who did \\"the long walk\\". Reader's Digest published his story in 2009.https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/exclusive- the-greatest-escape---war-394421 *Leszek Gliniecki, another Polish war survivor, claims to have multiple documents showing that Gli≈Ñski could not have been there. *Linda Willis did a decade of research on most parts of the story, without reaching a definite conclusion, but cleared up some details. Leszek Gliniecki has copies of official documents which state that Witold Gli≈Ñski was born in 1926 (22 November), was sent into forced exile to a special settlement Kriesty in Arkhagelsk Oblast (Province), Russia, and stayed there from 24 February 1940 to 2 September 1941. This is confirmed by the international organisation \\"Memorial\\", the Polish Institute of National Remembrance and the Arkhangelsk Province archives. The above information would not allow Witold Gli≈Ñski to have taken part in the Long Walk. Archives of the Polish Army in the West, and his death certificate confirm that Witold Gli≈Ñski was born in 1926. Citations from: 1. \\"Memorial\\": Victims of political terrorism in USSR; 2.

In 2008 the Dutch publisher, Querido, published a new translation by David Colmer of the first book of the series, with the original illustrations, entitled Jip and Janneke. The series has become something of a popular icon of childhood and has inspired a large amount of merchandise. One of the best known of these is Jip and Janneke Bubbelsap (Bubble Juice), which is a non-alcoholic carbonated lemonade sold in Champagne-style plastic bottles, popular at children's parties and for new year celebrations. In recent years, Jip and Janneke has become part of an expression. Jip and Janneke language (Dutch: jip-en-janneketaal) has come to mean \\"simple language\\", Layman's terms or Plain English.

In November 2007 the New York Times reported that he had died of lung cancer at a hospital in Havana, Cuba, five months before, although it has been suggested that he faked his death. Biography Vesco was the son of a Detroit autoworker. He was born in Detroit, Michigan, where he grew up and attended, and then quit, Cass Technical High School. He quit engineering school during his early twenties to work for an investment company. After a brief period he made an independent $800 stake matching buyers and sellers in the aluminum market, until he eventually acquired a portion of the profits of a floundering aluminum plant. By 1965, he could borrow enough money to acquire International Controls Corporation (ICC). Through aggressively hostile expansions and debt-financed takeovers of other businesses he increased ICC quickly. By 1968 the company owned an airline and several manufacturing plants, and Vesco had shares totaling US$50 million.Anreder, S.S. (1978) \\"Vesco's legacy: International Controls Corp. hopes to live it down,\\" Barron's. April 17, 1978. p. 9, 16-18. =IOS scandal= During 1970, Vesco began a successful takeover bid for Investors Overseas Service, Ltd., a mutual fund investment company with holdings of $1.5 billion managed by financier Bernard Cornfeld, who had gotten into trouble with the SEC. When his company began to experience financial difficulty, no \\"white knight\\" was willing to get involved. Vesco saw his chance and began a protracted battle to assume control of the company, opposed by Cornfeld and others. Cornfeld was jailed in Switzerland and Vesco was accused of looting the company of hundreds of millions of dollars. Many prominent figures in global business, finance, and royalty were associated with the mess, receiving money from one party or the other for their endorsement. Among the accusations against Vesco were that he parked funds belonging to IOS investors in a series of dummy corporations, one of which had an Amsterdam address that was later associated with Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, and that he broke into a Swiss bank vault to obtain shares. These allegations are unproven, as Vesco fled the country and spent the next fifteen years relocating between countries that lacked extradition treaties with the United States.Herzog, A. (1987) Vesco, His Rise, Fall and Flight. Retrieved 5/3/08.(1981) \\"Life after Vesco,\\" Barron's. September 7, 1981. p. 34-35. During February 1973, with criminal charges against him imminent, Vesco used the corporate jet to flee to Costa Rica along with about $200 million worth of IOS's investments, according to SEC allegations. Vesco would continue to wage a legal battle from Costa Rica and the Bahamas to try to maintain control of his 26 percent of ICC stock, but, with five outstanding indictments for securities fraud against him, he could not return to the United States. It was not until 1981 that ICC had completely become free of Vesco's control, after paying almost $12 million to him and his family.Burgess, W.H. (1982) \\"The remarkable recovery of the company Vesco left behind,\\" Management Review. May 1982. p. 31-32. =Nixon scandal= Among the charges that emerged during the 1970s, the SEC accused Vesco of embezzling $220 million from four different IOS funds. During 1973, Vesco fled to Costa Rica. Shortly before his departure, hoping to end the SEC investigation into his activities, Vesco routed substantial contributions to Richard Nixon through Nixon's nephew Donald A. Nixon. Vesco was also investigated for a secret $200,000 contribution made to the 1972 campaign to re-elect Nixon. As counsel to International Controls Corporation, New Jersey lawyer Harry L. Sears delivered the contribution to Maurice Stans, finance chairman for the Committee to Re- elect the President. Vesco had wanted Attorney General John N. Mitchell to intercede on his behalf with SEC chairman William J. Casey. While Vesco fled the country, Stans, Mitchell, and Sears were indicted for obstruction of justice, though charges against all three were dismissed. =\\"Vesco law\\"= In Costa Rica, Vesco donated $2.1 million to Sociedad Agricola Industrial San Cristobal, S.A., a company initiated by President Jos√© Figueres. Figueres passed a law to guarantee that Vesco would not be extradited. Figueres' constitutional term ended during 1974. Vesco remained in Costa Rica until 1978, when President Rodrigo Carazo (1978‚Äì1982) repealed what was popularly referred to as the \\"Vesco Law.\\"(1979) \\"Learning to love exile\\", Time magazine.

During 1978 Vesco relocated first to Nassau and then to Antigua. * While in Nassau in the seventies, Vesco's business ties with Lynden Pindling and Carlos Lehder were the subject of CIA investigations. It is believed that Bill Fairclough (ostensibly working for Coopers & Lybrand) investigated these ties. Despite Vesco's fall-out with Pindling, he still maintained a golden gated mansion staffed by armed guards situated North East of Nassau close to Paradise Island where one of his yachts was moored as noted in the autobiographical journal Beyond Enkription by Fairclough (a.k.a. Edward Burlington). On Vesco's orders, Fairclough was drugged and kidnapped whilst at The Pink Pussycat Club on Delancy Street in Nassau. He awoke on Vesco's yacht but managed to force the yacht back to shore and escaped after having stolen a revolver from one of Vesco's guards. * While in Antigua Vesco tried unsuccessfully to buy the sister island Barbuda and establish it as a sovereign state. The Costa Rican government refused his attempt to return during 1978, while Rodrigo Carazo was President. During 1982 Vesco tried again to return to Costa Rica, but President Luis A.

II= During 1982 he relocated to Cuba, a country that could provide him with treatment for his painful urinary tract infections and would not extradite him to the U.S. Cuban authorities accepted him on the condition that he not become involved in any financial deals. He married Lidia Alfonso Llauger. Vesco was indicted during 1989 on drug smuggling charges. During the 1990s, Vesco became involved once again with Donald Nixon after Nixon went to Cuba seeking to partner with the government in conducting clinical trials on a substance called trixolan or TX, which he claimed boosted the immune system. Vesco introduced Nixon to Fidel Castro and his brother, Ra√∫l Castro, and the Cuban government agreed to provide laboratory facilities and doctors to conduct the trials. Results from the studies were claimed to be positive. In Cuba, Vesco joined forces with rogue former CIA operative Frank Terpil, and they offered their network of contacts to the Cuban government. On or about May 31, 1995, Vesco attempted to defraud Nixon and Ra√∫l Castro, and Cuban authorities seized control of the project and arrested Vesco, his wife, and Terpil. At the time of Vesco's arrest the Cuban Foreign Ministry said he had been taken into custody \\"under suspicion of being a provocateur and an agent of foreign special services,\\" or intelligence agencies. However, he was formally charged with \\"fraud and illicit economic activity\\" and \\"acts prejudicial to the economic plans and contracts of the state.\\" During 1996 the Cuban government sentenced Vesco to 13 years in prison on charges resulting from the scandal. He was scheduled for release during 2009, when he would have been 74 years old. Vesco's wife Lidia was convicted on lesser charges and was released during 2005. Reported death Vesco reportedly died of lung cancer in November 2007 and was buried at Colon Cemetery in Havana. However, reports of his death have been disputed; his associate Frank Terpil said that he had fled to Sierra Leone. In popular culture A fictionalized version of Vesco is featured prominently in a sixth season episode of The Blacklist, entitled \\"Robert Vesco (No. 9)\\", in which he is portrayed by actor Stacy Keach. The fictionalized Vesco is shown to have faked his own death in Cuba in 2007 and to be in pursuit of a legendary shipwreck from the Spanish treasure fleet.  References   Further reading  *Herzog, A.

A peat and sod dwelling Ot en Sien is a Dutch children's book series, written by Hindericus Scheepstra, a teacher in Drenthe, the Netherlands. It centers around two little children, a boy named Ot and a girl named Sien. It was the start of a new method of writing children's books and had profound influence on Dutch elementary education in the first half of the twentieth century The authors Ot and Sien are the main characters in a series of Dutch children's tales that were very popular in the first half of the twentieth century. The first series titled Dicht bij Huis (\\"Close to home\\"), appeared in 1902. The second series Nog bij Moeder (\\"Still with mother\\"), followed in 1904. The author of the stories was Hindericus Scheepstra. However, he acted on the inspiration of Jan Ligthart, who had the intention to expose young people to what he considered a healthy daily family life. The illustrations were made by . After WWII the stories of Ot and Sien gradually went out of fashion and they were often ridiculed for the unrealistic picture they gave of life in the province. A century after their appearance there is a revival in the interest for the publications and in 2004 an exposition was held, focusing mostly on the artwork by Jetses. The characters Ot (short for Otto) and Sien (short for e.g. Francine) are two next door neighbors, a boy and a girl. Their illustrations were based on two children that actually lived in Jetses' neighborhood. The stories are situated in Drenthe that was at the time the most impoverished province of the Netherlands where quite a few people were still living in dwellings constructed of peat and sods. The surrounding poverty is nowhere to be seen in the stories that depict a very idealized version of reality. Ligthart's philosophy What Ligthart intended was to give a description of the daily family interactions of the main characters as a means to set an idealized example \\"where from an early age Father and Mother relate to each other and to the children, where a civilized and wellwilling tone is dominant, where the parents give a living example of friendliness, adaptability and sacrifice on a daily basis, not only towards each other and the children, but also towards the servants and the guests\\" Influence on education Ligthart's philosophy was followed by many teachers in elementary schools in the Netherlands and the \\"Ot en Sien\\" books became a ubiquitous teaching tool for reading in elementary schools. This phenomenon lasted until deep in the 1950s and is one of the most remarkable developments in education in the country. Generations of children in the ever more urbanizing and suburbanizing society grew up with an idyllic and rather unrealistic view of what family life should be like and apparently was like in the country side of Drenthe. Few city kids ever experienced that and their parents certainly did not have a servant in the house. Knowing this, one is also aware that small town life is usually less expensive Still in the eighties, Ot en Sien were very present in the lives of the children that grew up in Drenthe, their stories are a classic and loved both by young and old. They have left a strong impression on those who had the luck of having a simple and perhaps a somewhat na√≠ve childhood, growing-up in this province. Monuments In the Hague a statue of Ot and Sien was erected in 1930. The text was to read \\"In memory of Jan Ligthart\\" but his widow Marie Lion Cachet objected to this because she knew that her husband had not actually written the stories, although he had given his friend Scheepstra continuous advice. Scheepstra had the advantage that he was a Drenthe native and so could add a measure of local color to the stories. The inscription therefore was amended to \\"In memory of Jan Ligthart and H. Scheepstra\\". Later the town of Roden in Drenthe also dedicated a monument to Ot and Sien and their creators.

He is mostly remembered today for his accidental death due to a failed bullet catch trick. Early years Robinson was born in Westchester County, New York, the first of three children born to James Campbell Robinson and his wife Sarah Robinson (n√©e Titus). Both of his parents were of Scottish descent. The family settled in Manhattan while James Robinson toured in Charles \\"Charlie\\" White's minstrel shows. James Robinson variously performed under the names \\"James Campbell\\", \\"H. J. Campbell\\" and \\"Professor Campbell\\", and his specialties included impersonations, \\"dialect singing\\", hypnotism, ventriloquism and magic tricks. He later taught his son how to perform magic tricks. Career Robinson performed his first magic show at the age of 14 and began performing professionally on the vaudeville circuit shortly thereafter. He initially performed under the name \\"Robinson, the Man of Mystery\\". Robinson earned a decent living performing his act but was eager to become a headliner on vaudeville. In 1887, he began performing \\"black art illusions\\" under the name \\"Achmed Ben Ali\\". The act and Robinson's new stage closely resembled that of German magician Max Auzinger, who performed under the name \\"Ben Ali Bey\\". (As Auzinger never toured the United States, the resemblance went largely unnoticed at the time). By 1896, Robinson had performed his acts in shows for Harry Kellar and Alexander Herrmann. After Herrmann's death in 1896, Robinson decided to strike out on his own. Around this time, Robinson learned of a challenge issued by Chinese stage magician Ching Ling Foo. In a gimmick that was standard for magicians of that era, Foo offered a prize of $1,000 to any person who could successfully duplicate his illusions. Robinson, who had watched Foo's act when he toured the United States and figured out how his illusions worked, accepted the challenge. However, Foo refused to meet with him as Robinson had accepted another previous challenge issued by Foo and lost. The snub left Robinson upset. In 1898, he authored the book Spirit Slate Writing and Kindred Phenomena. The book exposed the tricks of slate writing and a number of devices that fraudulent mediums would use to pretend to contact the dead. In 1900, Robinson learned that an agent was looking for a Chinese magician to perform at the Folies Berg√®re in Paris. He accepted the job and quickly created a new act based on Ching Ling Foo's act. Robinson then began dressing in traditional Chinese attire, shaved his facial hair and began wearing his hair in a queue. To darken his complexion, he painted his face with greasepaint. To complete his new act, Robinson chose the stage name \\"Hop Sing Soo\\". Robinson's new act was a hit, and by the time he began performing in London, he had perfected his act and changed his name to \\"Chung Ling Soo\\" (a variation of Ching Ling Foo's name). Robinson then set about creating a fanciful back story for himself. As \\"Chung Ling Soo\\", Robinson claimed he was the American-born son of a Scottish missionary who married a Cantonese woman. He claimed his father was a descendant of the Campbell and Robinson Clans and both his parents died before he was 13 years old. As an orphan, Soo said he was taken in by a Chinese magician named \\"Arr Hee\\", who trained him to perform ancient Chinese magic tricks mixed with more modern European magic. When Hee died, Soo began performing the magic his mentor had taught him. As Chung Ling Soo, Robinson maintained his role as a Chinese man scrupulously. He never spoke onstage, claiming that he spoke no English (though he did occasionally say phrases in broken English) and always used an interpreter when he spoke to journalists. Soo's Chinese wife, \\"Suee Seen\\", acted as his assistant. \\"Suee Seen\\" was also Robinson's invention; in reality, she was Olive \\"Dot\\" Path, an American woman who Robinson claimed was his wife. In fact, the two never married, as Robinson had never divorced his first wife, Bessie Smith. As Chung Ling Soo, Robinson quickly became a popular stage magician in Europe and eventually became one of the highest-paid performers on the vaudeville circuit. =Feud with Ching Ling Foo= The Cosmopolitan, pub. 1903. In January 1905, Soo was in London for an engagement at the Hippodrome. His rival, magician Ching Ling Foo, was performing at the nearby Empire Theatre. By this time, Foo was aware that Chung Ling Soo was actually William Robinson and that he had copied virtually Foo‚Äôs entire act. He publicly called Chung Ling Soo an imposter and became intent on publicly exposing him as such. In order to garner publicity, Foo's promoter publicly announced that he would duplicate at least half of Chung Ling Soo's illusions to prove that he was the real \\"Original Chinese Conjurer\\". Soo accepted the challenge and agreed to meet Foo at the offices of The Weekly Dispatch for a press conference. When Ching Ling Foo realized that the press was not interested in Chung Ling Soo's real identity, he backed out of the press conference and the challenge. The episode was a public embarrassment for Ching Ling Foo, who remained at the Empire Theatre for only four weeks (Chung Ling Soo's engagement at the Hippodrome lasted three months). Soo's most famous illusion, partly because of his death while performing it, was called \\"Condemned to Death by the Boxers\\".Jim Steinmeyer - Newsletter - Spring 2005 - Excerpt from Glorious Deception , \\"Chung Ling Soo had included Condemned to Death by the Boxers in his shows\\" ... \\"The Mystic Bottle was the illusion in which little bottles became the giant bottle, The Living Target was the rope and arrow trick‚Äîthey found no mention of the gun illusion.\\" Accessed April 13, 2008 In this trick, Soo's assistants, sometimes dressed as Boxers, took two guns on to the stage. Several members of the audience were called up to the stage to mark a bullet that appeared to be loaded into one of the guns. Attendants fired the gun at Soo, and he appeared to catch the bullets from the air and drop them on a plate he held up in front of him. Actually, Soo palmed the bullets, hiding them in his hand during their examination and marking. The muzzle-loaded guns were rigged so that the gunpowder charge fired in a chamber below the barrel so that the bullet never left the gun. Personal life Robinson married his assistant Bessie Smith on February 23, 1883. Shortly after the couple married, in December 1883, a woman with whom Robinson had been having an affair (possibly a young servant girl who worked for Robinson's parents) gave birth to his child, a girl named Annie. Robinson's parents took the child in and raised her. Robinson and Smith would later have a son, Elmore (born February 1885). After the birth of their son, Smith could no longer rehearse long hours and travel with Robinson as his assistant. He soon lost interest in his wife after meeting Olive \\"Dot\\" Path (born Augusta Pfaff), who would also become his assistant. As divorce was considered socially unacceptable at the time and Robinson was a Roman Catholic, he and Smith never formally divorced and simply decided to \\"cancel\\" their marriage. Robinson and Path presented themselves as husband and wife for the next twenty years. They eventually married in a civil ceremony in March 1906. The marriage was not legally recognized as Robinson was still married to Bessie Smith. Shortly after Robinson married Path, he met Janet Louise Mary \\"Lou\\" Blatchford, an English woman from Plymouth. They began a sexual relationship and Blatchford became pregnant in May 1907. Path was angry to learn that Robinson had been unfaithful but the two decided to continue to present themselves as husband and wife for the sake of the act. While \\"Chung Ling Soo\\" and \\"Suee Seen\\" continued to tour Europe, Blatchford lived in Barnes, London. In between engagements, Robinson would visit the home and the couple's children, of which there were eventually three: Ellsworth James (born February 1908), Hector (born December 1909) and Mary (born March 1911). The only known film record of \\"Chung Ling Soo\\" that exists today shows him greeting World War I veterans at a 1915 benefit performance. Death Chung Ling Soo in The Old and New Magic (1906) East Sheen Cemetery On March 23, 1918, Chung Ling Soo was performing at the Wood Green Empire in London. He performed his act without incident until he got to his famous \\"Condemned to Death by the Boxers\\" illusion. That night, as one of his assistants fired the modified gun at him, some of the gunpowder exploded in the gun's chamber, accidentally firing the bullet (loaded only for show by the assistant) into Soo's lung. He fell to the ground and said, \\"Oh my God. Something's happened. Lower the curtain.\\" This was the only time since adopting his persona that \\"Chung Ling Soo\\" had spoken English in public. Soo was taken to Passmore Edwards Cottage Hospital, but died the following morning. He is buried in East Sheen Cemetery in East Sheen, a suburb of London. The assistant who fired the gun, Jack Grossman, appeared on the UK TV show The Paul Daniels Magic Show, broadcast on November 6, 1982, where he assisted magician Paul Daniels to successfully recreate the trick. During the inquest, Olive \\"Dot\\" Path explained the nature of the Chung Ling Soo's trick. The muskets Soo used in his act were brazed with extra steel barrels. After each performance, to avoid expending powder and bullets, Soo never unloaded his guns properly. Rather than firing them off or drawing the bullets with a screw-rod, as was normal practice, he removed the bullet and powder by dismantling the breeches of the guns. Over time, a residue of unburned gunpowder was able to form in the channel he had made to allow the flash to bypass the barrel and ignite a blank charge in the ramrod tube. Thus, when Soo performed the trick that night, ignition of the residue in the channel allowed the flash from the pan to also ignite the charge behind the bullet not intended to be fired that was loaded into the barrel of the gun being used. Consequently, the bullet fired in the normal way, hitting Soo in the chest. The circumstances of the accident were verified by the gun expert Robert Churchill. Soo's death was ruled \\"accidental\\" with a final verdict of \\"misadventure\\". After Chung Ling Soo's death, the public was shocked to learn that he was not Chinese. Soo's true identity was largely known among professional magicians. A year before Soo's death, magician Will Goldston commented in an interview with Magician Monthly that the public did not question Soo's identity because \\"... he has always presented to the public that which they like and not which he might prefer\\". In popular culture His story is related by the detective in Gus Van Sant's Last Days. It also figures prominently in Bruce Hartman's book, The Philosophical Detective, in the story \\"Illusionists.\\" See also * List of entertainers who died during a performance Notes References * Cayetano (YouTube) \\"The Secret\\"...

Initial development took place before the war and the apparatus entered service in 1940. Eventually over 4,000 W√ºrzburgs of various models were produced. It took its name from the city of W√ºrzburg. Development In January 1934, Telefunken met with German radar researchers, notably Dr. Rudolf K√ºhnhold of the Communications Research Institute of the Kriegsmarine and Dr. Hans Hollmann, an expert in microwaves, who informed them of their work on an early warning radar. Telefunken's director of research, Dr. Wilhelm Runge, was unimpressed and dismissed the idea as science fiction. The developers then went their own way and formed GEMA () eventually collaborating with Lorenz on the development of the Freya and Seetakt systems. By the spring of 1935, GEMA's successes made it clear to Runge that the idea was workable after all, so he started a crash program at Telefunken to develop radar systems. With Lorenz already making progress on early warning devices, Runge had the Telefunken team concentrate on a short-range gun laying system instead. Management apparently felt it to be as uninteresting as Runge had a year earlier and assigned it a low priority for development. By the summer they had built a working experimental unit in the band that was able to generate strong returns off a target Junkers Ju 52. By the next summer, the experimental set- up had been developed into a prototype known as the Darmstadt, which offered a range accuracy of at , not nearly enough for gun laying. Attitudes changed in late 1938, when a full development contract was received from the Luftwaffe. The resulting system, known as the FuMG 62, as well as the prototype system FuMG 39T Darmstadt were demonstrated to Hitler at Rechlin in July 1939. The Telefunken team developed an accurate system based on a klystron microwave tube operating in the range of ‚Äîan extremely short wavelength for the time‚Äîwith a pulse length of 2 microseconds, a peak power of and a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 3,750 Hz. It had a maximum range of about and was accurate to about in range. W√ºrzburg used a paraboloid dish antenna, which could be \\"folded\\" along the horizontal midline for travel on a wheeled trailer. The system was first accepted into service in 1940 and this basic layout were delivered. Operational models W√ºrzburg D in use. The quirl conical scanning antenna is prominent. Several versions of the basic W√ºrzburg system were deployed over the course of the war. The first, W√ºrzburg A, was operated manually and required the operators to pinpoint the target by maintaining a maximum signal on their oscilloscope display. Since the signal strength changed on its own for various reasons as well as being on or off target, this was inaccurate and generally required the use of a searchlight to spot the target once the radar had settled on an approximate position. Nevertheless, one of the first W√ºrzburgs in service directly assisted in the shooting-down of an aircraft in May 1940 by orally relaying commands to a flak unit. An experimental W√ºrzburg B added an infra-red detector for fine tuning, but in general these devices proved to be unusable and production was discontinued. W√ºrzburg A folded for travel. Note the simple antenna system. W√ºrzburg C featured lobe switching to improve aiming accuracy. The C model improved aiming by sending the signal out of one of two slightly off-centre feed horns in the middle of the antenna, with the signal being switched rapidly between the two horns. After slightly delaying the signal from one of the horns, the returns were sent to an oscilloscope display. The result appeared as two closely separated blips which the operator attempted to keep at the same height on the display. This system offered much faster feedback on changes in target position. Changes in signal strength, due to changes in reflection off the target, affected both lobes equally, eliminating common reading errors. An almost identical system was used in the United States's first gun-laying radar, the SCR-268. Details of the rotating quirl dipole. The flat disk on the left, the reflector, faces the target. The rotating dipole broadcasts toward the reflector, which reflects the signal to the right. The main antenna dish would be positioned out of frame on the right, where it would focus the signal into a narrow beam facing the target. The W√ºrzburg D was introduced in 1941 and added a conical scanning system using an offset receiver feed called a Quirl (German for whisk) that spun at The resulting signal was slightly offset from the centreline of the dish, rotating around the axis and overlapping it in the centre. If the target aircraft was to one side of the antenna's axis, the strength of the signal would grow and fade as the beam swept across it, allowing the system to move the dish in the direction of the maximum signal and thereby track the target. The angular resolution could be made smaller than the beam width of the antenna, leading to much improved accuracy, on the order of 0.2 degrees in azimuth and 0.3 degrees in elevation. Earlier examples were generally upgraded to the D model in the field. Even the D model was not accurate enough for direct laying of guns. In order to provide the system with much greater accuracy, the FuMG 65 W√ºrzburg-Riese (known as the \\"Giant W√ºrzburg\\") was developed. Based on the same circuitry as the D model, the new version featured a much larger antenna and a more powerful transmitter with a range of up to . Azimuth and elevation accuracy was 0.1-0.2 degrees, which was more than enough for direct gun- laying. The system was too large to be carried on a truck trailer and was adapted for operation from a railway carriage as the W√ºrzburg-Riese-E, of which 1,500 were produced during the war. The W√ºrzburg-Riese Gigant was a very large version with a 160 kW transmitter, which never entered production. A W√ºrzburg system at Bruneval on the coast of France was captured by British Paratroopers in Operation Biting, while Operation Bellicose bombed the suspected W√ºrzburg radar factory. The Operation Hydra bombing of Peenem√ºnde did not affect the nearby Giant W√ºrzburg at the Lubmin guidance and control station used for the V-2 rocket. Post-War Use in Astronomy Dutch scientists brought several of the surplus German coastal W√ºrzburg radars to the Radio Transmitting Station in Kootwijk, Netherlands in the early 1950s. There, they were used in experiments important in the development of early radio astronomy, specifically the discovery of the Hydrogen line and subsequent mapping of the spiral arms of the Milky Way Galaxy.

Rail transport in New Zealand has a particular focus on bulk freight exports and imports, with 19 million net tonnes moved by rail annually, with 99.5% of New Zealand's exports and imports being transported through the country's seaports. Rail transport played an important role in the opening up and development of the hinterland outside of New Zealand's predominantly dispersed and coastal settlements. Starting with the Ferrymead Railway in 1863, most public railway lines were short, built by provincial governments and connected major centres to their nearest seaport (such as Christchurch and its port at Lyttelton Harbour). From the 1870s, focus shifted to building a nationwide network linking major centres, especially during the Vogel Era of railway construction following the abolition of the provinces. Narrow gauge of 3ft 6in (1,067mm) was adopted nationally. Railways became centrally controlled as a government department under the names New Zealand Government Railways or New Zealand Railways Department (NZR), and land transport was heavily regulated from 1931 onwards. NZR eventually expanded into other transport modes, especially with the Railways Road Services, inter-island ferries and Rail Air service. NZR also had an extensive network of workshops. By 1981, NZR employed 22,000 staff. In the early 1980s, NZR was corporatised as the New Zealand Railways Corporation and drastically restructured, especially following the deregulation of land transport in 1983. The Corporation became a state-owned enterprise in 1987, required to turn a profit. In 1991, the rail, inter-island ferry and infrastructure businesses of the Railways Corporation were split off into New Zealand Rail Limited, which was in turn privatised in 1993, and renamed Tranz Rail in 1995. The parcels and bus service business units were also privatised, and the Railways Corporation continued to dispose of surplus land. The central government renationalised first the Auckland metro railway network in 2001, then the rest of the country in 2004, and finally the rail and ferry operations in 2008, creating a new state-owned enterprise, KiwiRail. Today, services are primarily provided by KiwiRail and focused on bulk freight, with a small number of tourist orientated passenger services, such as the TranzAlpine, Coastal Pacific and Northern Explorer. Dunedin Railways also operate tourist trains out of Dunedin, and a number of heritage operators run charter specials from time to time. Urban passenger rail services exist only in Auckland and Wellington. Rail in New Zealand has received significant and ongoing government investment since re-nationalisation in 2008, with the two urban rail systems being upgraded. History = Provincial period (1863‚Äì1876) = The railway network was initially constructed by the provincial governments of New Zealand from 1863 onwards. New Zealand's first public railway was opened in that year, running the short distance between Christchurch and the wharf at Ferrymead and built by the Canterbury Provincial Railways. The Canterbury Provincial Railways were built to the broad gauge of . In February 1867, Southland Province opened a branch from Invercargill to Bluff to the international standard gauge of . Vogel Era The first Parnell Tunnel under construction on the Auckland-Drury line in c. 1873. The line was originally started by the Auckland Province but completed by the central government. From 1870, the central government of Sir Julius Vogel proposed infrastructure including railway development to be funded by overseas loans of ¬£10 million. The central government also adopted a national gauge of with the passing of the Railways Act 1871. The first narrow-gauge line was opened on 1 January 1873 in the Otago Province, the Port Chalmers Branch under the auspices of the Dunedin and Port Chalmers Railway Company Limited. Auckland's first railway, between Auckland and Onehunga, opened in 1873. Vogel also arranged for Brogdens of England to undertake several rail construction contracts, to be built by \\"Brogden's Navvies\\" recruited in England. = Central Government control (1876‚Äì1982) = Following the abolition of the provinces in 1876, railway lines were controlled by the central government, originally under the Public Works Department, and from 1880 under the New Zealand Railways Department. A Minister of Railways was responsible for the department and was a member of the New Zealand Cabinet. A few private companies built railways in New Zealand, including the New Zealand Midland Railway Company, Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company, Waimea Plains Railway, and Thames Valley and Rotorua Railway Company. Only the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company, nationalised in 1908, achieved any measure of success, with the rest being purchased by the Government before completion of their intended railway lines. One exception to this rule was the Ohai Railway Board in Southland, which was owned by the State Mines department and a local county council until its dissolution in 1990. The first major route was completed between Christchurch and Dunedin in 1878, later extended to Invercargill the following year. The North Island Main Trunk, linking capital city Wellington with the largest city Auckland, opened in 1908 after 23 years of construction. At the network's peak in 1952, about 100 branch lines were operating. Large-scale closures of branch railway lines began in the 1960s and 1970s. The network was initially protected from road transport competition under the Transport Licensing Act 1931, but this protection was gradually eased until its total abolition in 1983, along with the deregulation of the land transport industry. DEV Aratere in the Tory Channel, June 2018. The rail ferries operated by KiwiRail under the brand \\"Interisland Line\\" connect the networks of both the North and South Islands. The networks of the North and South Islands were independent of one another until the introduction of the inter-island roll-on roll-off rail ferry service in 1962 by the Railways Department, now branded The Interislander. = Corporatised ownership (1982‚Äì1993)= In 1982, the Railways Department was corporatised into a new entity at the same time land transport was deregulated. The Railways Department became the New Zealand Railways Corporation. The Corporation embarked on a major restructuring, laying off thousands of staff and cutting unprofitable services. After the 1983 land transport deregulation there was a substantial rationalisation of freight facilities; many stations and smaller yards were closed and freight train services were sped up, increased in length and made heavier, with the removal of guard's vans in 1987 and the gradual elimination of older rolling stock, particularly four-wheeled wagons. In 1987, the Railways Corporation became a state-owned enterprise, required to make a profit. In 1990, the core rail operations of the Corporation were transferred to New Zealand Rail Limited, another state-owned enterprise, with the Corporation retaining non-core assets which were gradually disposed of, including a significant land portfolio. In many cases, the Corporation did not dispose of land due to Treaty of Waitangi claims and has continued to manage land. = Private ownership (1993‚Äì2004) = New Zealand Rail Limited was privatised in 1993. In 1995 the new owners adopted the name Tranz Rail and listed the company on the New Zealand stock market and NASDAQ. Rail freight volumes increased between 1993 and 2000 from 8.5m net tonnes to 14.99m net tonnes carried annually, and then gradually fell until 2003 to 13.7m tonnes. Freight volumes then increased again to 16.1m tonnes carried annually in 2012. Tranz Rail was accused of deliberately running down some lines through lack of maintenance. The Midland Line for example, which mostly carries coal from the West Coast to Lyttelton, was assessed to be in a safe but poor state by the LTSA government safety body in 2003, and has needed major repairs. Tranz Rail was accused of forcing freight onto the roads, and in 2002 introduced a containerisation scheme that assumed that most freight would be carried in containers on unit trains made up of fixed consists of flat deck wagons. Container loading depots were constructed at the major freight terminals. One of the reasons often cited for these policies was that the cost of using road transport to Tranz Rail was less than that of using rail because the road infrastructure is provided as a public good, whereas the rail network was a private good. Government purchase of Auckland rail network The government purchased the Auckland metropolitan rail network from Tranz Rail for $81 million in 2002. Tranz Rail retained time slots for freight trains, and the Auckland Regional Council was granted slots for it to contract the operation of suburban passenger trains. Auckland railway stations not already local council owned were transferred to Auckland Regional Transport Network Limited (ARTNL), owned by the Auckland territorial authorities, which was merged with the Auckland Regional Transport Authority (ARTA), a subsidiary of the Auckland Regional Council (ARC). With the creation of the \\"super-city\\" Auckland Council in 2010, ARTA was dissolved and its role was taken over by Auckland Transport, a new council-controlled organisation. = Private and government ownership (2004‚Äì2008) = In 2003, the share price of Tranz Rail dropped to a record low on the New Zealand sharemarket, dropping 88% in value in 12 months as a result of its poor financial state and credit downgrading. The government then considered various schemes for bailing it out in return for regaining control of the rail infrastructure. Cited reasons included a \\"level playing field\\" for freight movements on road and rail, and ensuring access to the tracks for all interested parties. Toll Holdings of Australia made a successful takeover bid for Tranz Rail, subject to an agreement to sell back the infrastructure to the government for $1. In exchange, Toll was granted exclusive use of the rail network subject to minimum freight and passenger volumes, payment of track access charges and its own investment in new rolling stock. This transaction took place in July 2004, and Tranz Rail was renamed Toll NZ. The government committed $200 million of taxpayer funding for deferred maintenance and capital improvements via a new subsidiary of the New Zealand Railways Corporation, ONTRACK. An interim agreement was signed by Toll NZ for track access; Toll paid a nominal track access charge while negotiating a final agreement with ONTRACK. These negotiations did not progress and eventually went to arbitration at the start of 2008. = Renationalisation (2008‚Äìcurrent) = DXB 5143 at Wellington railway station on 1 July 2008 at the launch of KiwiRail. Instead of concluding a final track access agreement with Toll, in 2008 the government purchased the rail and ferry assets for $690 million, effective 1 July 2008. The new organisation created to operate services on the rail network was named KiwiRail. Ownership of the national rail network is vested in KiwiRail Holdings Limited, with land owned by the New Zealand Railways Corporation. KiwiRail Network (formerly ONTRACK) is a division of KiwiRail that maintains and upgrades the rail infrastructure and is responsible for the control of the network (i.e. train control and signalling). Other rail operating companies using the rail network include Transdev Auckland and Transdev Wellington, who operate suburban services in Auckland and Wellington respectively, and Dunedin Railways, who operate tourist trains out of Dunedin. KiwiRail released in 2010 a 10-year turnaround plan for the rail industry. This was accompanied by significant government investment in KiwiRail of over $2.1 billion during the period 2008 to February 2017. In May 2017, the government announced a further $450 million capital injection and that KiwiRail would be subject to a further significant review. The plan has been significantly undermined by the Christchurch earthquakes of 2010 and 2011, the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake, Pike River Mine disaster, coal price collapse, coal miner Solid Energy going into voluntary administration in 2016 and major motive power issues with the new DL class of locomotives. Nevertheless, significant improvements in freight volumes have followed (other than with coal). Two of KiwiRail's major customers, Mainfreight and Fonterra, also invested heavily in rail-related infrastructure. Mainfreight allocated $60 million for investment in new railhead depots, while Fonterra invested $130m in a new rail hub complex in Hamilton and another planned for Mosgiel. In 2019, the government began a \\"Future of Rail\\" review, and in December 2019 released a draft New Zealand Rail Plan, outlining changes to the rail transport industry. The draft plan proposes a number of major changes, the most significant being future funding of the rail network through the National Land Transport Fund. Current projects The City Rail Link is an underground rail line currently under construction linking Britomart Transport Centre to Mount Eden railway station in Auckland, and is due to open in 2024. Light rail networks are planned for Auckland and Wellington. Advocacy group Greater Auckland proposed the Regional Rapid Rail initiative in 2017, including tilt trains with a maximum speed of 160 km/h. This network would provide passenger services linking Auckland with Hamilton, Tauranga and Rotorua. In December 2018, the Government of New Zealand committed funding to reintroducing a five-year trial rail service, named Te Huia, between Papakura in southern Auckland to Hamilton, starting in 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand, the Te Huia service had been delayed commencing operations to sometime after 3 August 2020, changed from its initial announced opening date of March 2020. In 2020, the government announced funding for a number of rail-related infrastructure projects, mainly in the Auckland region. Operations = Freight = Freight marshalling yard in Dunedin, 16 August 2007. Freight makes up the bulk of KiwiRail's annual revenues.

JA class locomotive 1271 on an excursion at Ahuriri in 2003. Freight is carried by KiwiRail and provides the majority of its revenue traffic. In the 2017‚Äì2018 financial year, freight contributed $350.7 million in revenue or 57% of the company's total revenue. Freight is mostly bulk traffic geared towards export industries, with general freight being largely restricted to containerised and palletised products on the trunk route. Major bulk freight includes coal, lime, steel, wood and wood products, paper pulp, dry and liquid milk, cars, fertiliser, grain and shipping containers. Freight levels have returned to the level that they were at when the railway had a virtual monopoly on land transport, prior to 1983. In 1980 11.8 million tonnes of freight was moved by rail, in 1994 this had decreased to 9.4 million tonnes. By 1999, tonnes carried had increased to 12.9 million tonnes, slightly more than the 1975 peak. In the 2006‚Äì2007 financial year, 13.7 million tonnes of freight were carried. This equated to 3.96 million net tonne kilometres (or the number of tonnes of traffic gained in 2008‚Äì2009 compared to the amount of traffic hauled in the 2006‚Äì2007 year). In recent years the amount of freight moved by rail has increased substantially and has started to gain market share in non-bulk areas as well. Freight on the North Island Main Trunk line between Auckland and Palmerston North saw an increase of 39% in freight volumes between 2006 and 2007. The five daily trains on the 667 km line reduced truck volumes on the route by around 120 per day. A 2008 study by the Ministry of Transport predicted that by 2031 rail freight volumes would increase to 23 million tonnes per annum or 70% on the 2006‚Äì2007 financial year. In 2018 the same report found freight levels had increased by 17% between 2007 and 2012. = Long-distance passenger services = As of 2017, there are only four long- distance passenger routes: the Northern Explorer between Auckland and Wellington, the Capital Connection between Wellington and Palmerston North, the Coastal Pacific between Picton and Christchurch, and the TranzAlpine between Christchurch and Greymouth. All are operated by The Great Journeys of New Zealand, a division of KiwiRail, and are tourism focused except for the Capital Connection, which is a commuter service. Until June 2020, Dunedin Railways operated tourist trains out of Dunedin, with frequent services on the former Otago Central Railway line and occasional services north from Dunedin to Palmerston. This service was mothballed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mixed trains were \\"once the backbone of the New Zealand railway passenger system\\" on branch and even main lines; but the last scheduled mixed train ran between Whangarei and Opua on 6 June 1977. With a \\"rake of assorted wagons\\" and one or two passenger carriages, often listed as \\"goods with car\\" in timetables, they were slow, often stopping and shunting wagons en route. In the 1930s they ran from Christchurch to Springfield on the Midland Line, and into the 1950s overnight between Christchurch and Dunedin. On the North Island Main Trunk they ran during the day while the expresses ran at night. On the Okahukura-Stratford Line they lasted to the early 1970s. In the 1950s and 1960s, most provincial routes had railcar and locomotive-hauled passenger services. In 1965, 25 million passengers travelled by rail; by 1998 the number had decreased to 11.7 million. A number of services came to an end in the early 2000s, including the Waikato Connection between Hamilton and Auckland, the Kaimai Express between Auckland and Tauranga, the Geyserland Express between Auckland and Rotorua, the Bay Express between Wellington and Napier, the Southerner between Christchurch and Invercargill and the Northerner night service between Auckland and Wellington. = Suburban passenger services = Currently, Auckland and Wellington have suburban passenger services. In both cities, the respective local governments own the suburban passenger rolling stock and contract the operation of services to a third-party, in both cases Transdev.  Wellington  The Wellington suburban network has five lines: Johnsonville, Kapiti, Melling, Hutt Valley and Wairarapa. In 1938, Wellington became the second city (after the Christchurch service to Lyttelton) to have electric suburban trains, and from 1970 to 2014 was the only city with them. From July 2016, the services have been operated by Transdev Wellington. Prior to Transdev, KiwiRail's Tranz Metro division held the contract. Wellington's suburban rolling stock consists of electric multiple units, with diesel locomotive-hauled carriage trains used on the Wairarapa service. All of the rolling stock (except the diesel locomotives) is owned by Greater Wellington Rail Limited, a subsidiary of Greater Wellington Regional Council. Transdev Wellington contracts KiwiRail to provide and operate the required diesel locomotives.  Auckland  Auckland's network consists of four lines: Southern, Eastern, Western and Onehunga. All services on these lines are provided by AM class electric trains, the conversion from diesel being completed by the end of 2015 with the exception of the non-electrified section of track between Papakura and Pukekohe, where a diesel train shuttle service operates. Transdev Auckland operates the electric trains on behalf of Auckland Transport (AT). In recent years the mothballed Onehunga Branch was reopened (2010) and a new line was built (Manukau Branch, opened April 2012). Recent major projects include electrification of the Auckland suburban network and the building of the City Rail Link. Most Auckland rolling stock is owned by Auckland Transport, which funds and coordinates all services.  Other cities  In 2017, the recently elected Labour-led Coalition government proposed to provide commuter rail in Christchurch and to provide long-distance commuter services from Auckland to Hamilton and Tauranga. Other cities (Christchurch, Dunedin, Invercargill and Napier-Hastings) once had suburban services, but they were withdrawn due to a lack of patronage. The Christchurch-Lyttelton suburban service was stopped in 1972 when passengers were down to \\"a busload\\". The last \\"boat train\\" for the ferry service to Wellington ran in 1976. The 10.5 km line to Lyttelton was electrified from 1929 to 1970. There were worker's trains north to Rangiora; two in the morning and two in the afternoon. Dunedin had suburban trains to Port Chalmers and Mosgiel, withdrawn on 3 December 1982. The Invercargill to Bluff service stopped in 1967; in 1929 the sole Clayton steam railcar had been used. Trains ran the between Napier and Hastings but some were replaced by a New Zealand Railways Road Services bus in 1926, and soon they ceased altogether. Worker's concession tickets had been introduced in 1897, initially for the Wellington- Hutt service, and extended next year to Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin (and then between Westport and Waimangaroa). A 1979 NZR report \\"Time for Change\\" said that the Wellington suburban services revenue met only 26% of operating costs (Dunedin was 28%, Auckland 46%). =School commuters= Up to the 1930s and 1940s, pupils had to commute to larger towns for secondary education from places that only had a primary school; for example from rural Canterbury to Christchurch Technical High School. Another famous example was Sir Edmund Hillary who commuted by school train from Tuakau to Auckland Grammar School for three and a half hours, a one-hour and 40 minutes journey each way. School trains ran between Picton and Blenheim, allowing Picton students to attend Marlborough College (split into Marlborough Boys' College and Marlborough Girls' College in 1963). The service was cancelled when Queen Charlotte College opened in Picton in 1965, and those students remaining at the Marlborough Colleges switched to buses. The NZR offered season tickets for primary and secondary school students from 1877, using funds paid for out of the Education budget, and from 1885 for students attending primary schools from a place lacking a local school. Premier Richard Seddon and the Liberal Government were keen to place secondary education \\"within the reach of the poorest man in the Colony\\" with an extension of the free passes in 1898 and 1909. School season passes increased from 8720 in 1899 to 29,705 in 1914‚Äì15, when one in seven primary and secondary students travelled by train. Some pupils reached home after dark in the winter and had to milk cows before and after school. John Pascoe said that some children spend \\"up to six hours a day travelling.\\" Boys and girls were usually segregated. Infrastructure and mechanical = Rail network = The New Zealand rail network has around of line, of which about is electrified. At the network's peak in 1953, some of line was open. There are currently 1787 bridges and 150 tunnels (totalling in length) on the rail network. The entire network is built to the gauge, chosen due to the need to cross mountainous terrain in the country's interior and the lower cost of construction. Difficult terrain meant that some lines took years to complete, and has necessitated a number of complicated engineering feats, notably the Raurimu Spiral and Rimutaka Incline (the latter no longer in use). The network has been the subject of major upgrading works on a number of occasions. The biggest of these were the Westfield Deviation of the North Island Main Trunk from Auckland to Westfield Junction via Panmure and Glen Innes, opened 1930, the Tawa Flat deviation in Wellington, opened 1937; the Rimutaka deviation to the Wairarapa, opened 1955; and the Kaimai deviation in the Bay of Plenty, opened 1978. All of these involved major tunnelling works, of close to each in the two latter cases. Significant infrastructure improvements were also carried out on the North Island Main Trunk in the mid-1980s, some as part of the electrification scheme. As part of the 10-year Turnaround Plan announced in 2010, a number of regional lines were placed under threat of closure: all lines in Northland that form part of the North Auckland Line, the Stratford‚ÄìOkahukura Line in Taranaki (mothballed since 2009), the northern portion of the Wairarapa Line, the Gisborne ‚Äì Napier section of the Palmerston North - Gisborne Line (mothballed due to storm damage north of Wairoa early 2012, mothballed Napier ‚Äì Gisborne from October 2012) As part of KiwiRail's 10-year long-term plan, most new capital will be spent on locomotives, wagons and the Auckland ‚Äì Wellington ‚Äì Christchurch freight corridor. =Signalling= Six signalling systems are used in New Zealand: automatic signalling rules (ASR), double line automatic (DLA), single line automatic (SLA), centralised traffic control (CTC), track warrant control (TWC), and station limits. Signals are of the colour light type and operate on speed signalling principles, i.e. signals tell the driver what speed they should proceed, but not necessarily the route they will take. The Auckland suburban network is also equipped with European Train Control System (ETCS) Level 1 signalling and train protection. =Motive power=  Steam  From its inception until the 1950s, steam locomotives were the main motive power on New Zealand's railways. Initially, steam locomotives were mostly imported from the United Kingdom from various manufacturers. The first major class was the F class tank locomotives, of which 88 were imported. From the 1870s, locomotives were imported from the United States, and generally found to be better suited to New Zealand's conditions, although the pro-British public and politicians preferred locomotives from the United Kingdom. In 1889, NZR began manufacturing its own locomotives, starting with the NZR W class. Local engineering firm A & G Price also manufactured a significant number of steam locomotives for NZR.  Diesel  Dieselisation of rail transport began in the late 1940s with small shunting locomotives. The first mainline diesel locomotives, the English Electric DF class, were introduced in 1954, but it was not until the introduction of the DA class locomotives the following year that steam began to be seriously displaced in the North Island. The last steam locomotive to be built by NZR, JA 1274, was introduced into service in December 1956, and by 1967, steam had all but disappeared from the North Island. Steam remained in the South Island until November 1971, when the last seven JA locomotives that worked the Main South Line were withdrawn from revenue service, steam in the South Island having been displaced by the DJ class locomotive. Starting from the mid-1970s, the first generation diesel locomotives were withdrawn, being replaced by new locomotives, predominantly designs from North America. The General Electric manufactured DX class were introduced from 1972‚Äì1975, and the original DF class were withdrawn and the General Motors DF class introduced from 1979. NZR also rebuilt some of the DG class locomotives. At the same time, the newest locomotives of the DA class were rebuilt as DC class locomotives in Australia and New Zealand. The last of the first-generation diesel locomotives were withdrawn in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Chinese-built DL class locomotive 9193 hauling a freight train at Middlemore in November 2012. The DL class are the newest locomotives on New Zealand's network. Due to a decline in rail freight volumes following land transport deregulation in 1983, and the introduction of electrification on the North Island Main Trunk, no new mainline diesel locomotives were introduced in the 1990s. Some second-hand locomotives were imported from Queensland Rail in the mid-1990s and rebuilt as DQ class locomotives, most of these locomotives were then re-exported to TasRail, then part-owned by Tranz Rail. The first new diesel locomotives imported to New Zealand since the 1970s were the DL class locomotives from China, arriving from 2010 onwards.  Electric  In the 1920s, two short sections of railway line were electrified at 1500 V DC: Arthur's Pass to Otira (electrified 1923) and Christchurch to Lyttelton (1929), both which have since been decommissioned. Electrification of the Wellington suburban network at 1500 V DC began in 1938 with the Johnsonville Line, followed by the North Island Main Trunk (NIMT) as far as Paekakariki in 1940, and the Hutt Valley lines in 1953‚Äì55. The NIMT electrification was extended to Paraparaumu in 1983 and to Waikanae in 2011. In 1988, 25 kV AC electrification of the North Island Main Trunk (NIMT) between Palmerston North and Hamilton was commissioned, and a new generation of mainline electric locomotives, the EF class, was introduced. In 2014, electrification of Auckland's suburban rail network was completed, also built to 25 kV AC. =Couplings= Norwegian couplers on historic railway wagons in Little River, New Zealand. The Norwegian coupling was the standard coupler used in New Zealand for non-passenger rolling stock and locomotives until recent years. In the 1970s a large heavy-duty version of the chopper coupler was developed, initially for the DX class. Auckland's AM class and Wellington's FP/FT class \\"Matangi\\" electric multiple units use the Scharfenberg coupling. The Janney (\\"Alliance\\") coupler was first used on heavy coal trains and have been progressively introduced on newer rolling stock and rebuilt locomotives. A program of retrofitting older rolling stock has been underway since 2013. =Workshops= The New Zealand Railways Department had major workshops at Addington (Christchurch), Easttown (Wanganui), Hillside (Dunedin), Petone (Lower Hutt, near Wellington) then Hutt (Lower Hutt, near Wellington) and Newmarket then Otahuhu, (Auckland). All were progressively closed (mostly in the 1980s), leaving only Hutt Workshops still operating. A number of small maintenance depots also currently operate, for example at Addington, Christchurch. Accidents Safety regulation is the responsibility of the New Zealand Transport Agency. NZTA also investigates accidents and incidents with a view to ensuring regulations and rules were observed. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission may also inquire into selected accidents and incidents to determine the circumstances and causes and help prevent similar occurrences in the future. Modern signalling, train detection and communications systems, as well as an overall decline in rail passenger traffic, has greatly decreased the number of fatal accidents occurring on New Zealand's railway network. New Zealand's most serious rail disaster occurred on Christmas Eve 1953, during the visit of Queen Elizabeth II, when a lahar washed away the bridge in the Tangiwai disaster. 151 lives were lost when the bridge collapsed as a Wellington-Auckland express passenger train was crossing it. The next most serious accident was the Hyde railway disaster of 1943, when the Cromwell - Dunedin express derailed after travelling at excessive speed. 21 lives were lost. The driver was later found to have been intoxicated and was jailed for manslaughter. Heritage rail = Heritage mainline passenger services = Four heritage rail operators own and operate their own carriage and mainline-certified steam or diesel locomotive fleets. These are the Railway Enthusiasts Society, Steam Incorporated, Mainline Steam Trust and the Otago Excursion Train Trust. These groups have operated special excursion trains on the national network since 1978, and have been allowed to use suitable locomotives to haul these trains since 1985. =Heritage and museum railways= About 60 groups operate railway heritage lines or museums, almost all members of the Federation of Rail Organisations of New Zealand. They include street tramways and bush tramways as well as railways. Large-scale rail preservation in New Zealand got underway in the 1960s when many steam locomotives were withdrawn and branch lines closed. Current operations of the heritage railway type include the Kingston Flyer, Glenbrook Vintage Railway, Bush Tramway Club, Waitara Railway Preservation Society, Weka Pass Railway, and Dunedin Railways. Dunedin Railways is a Council-controlled organisation (CCO) 72% owned by the Dunedin City Council and runs the Taieri Gorge Limited which is in length, and various other services around Dunedin and Otago. All other lines are operated by voluntary societies. The Weka Pass Railway at is the most lengthy of these. The Bay of Islands Vintage Railway is in length, but is in poor condition; having operated its first trains through Kawakawa since operations ceased in 2000 for two weeks from 3 July 2007, the Society is now working on rehabilitating the track between Kawakawa and Opua.  In popular culture  New Zealand National Film Unit Film Director David Sims completed a number of films on the history of New Zealand railways, including Main Trunk Century (2009); The Truth About Tangiwai (2002); Total Steam (1996); North Island Main Trunk (1995).

The quay began life in 1225 as a simple village of shielings (seasonal huts used by hunters or fishermen) around the Pow Burn (stream or river); the town of North Shields takes its name from the shielings. The quay was originally located here to serve the nearby Tynemouth Castle and Priory. The original site is now largely derelict industrial land, which lately belonged to the original Tyne Brand canning company. The Pow Burn runs from nearby Northumberland Park and disappears underground at Tynemouth Road and the Metro urban transport line. It eventually reappears at the 'Gut' at the eastern end of the Fish Quay, where it flows into the Tyne. The growth of North Shields was at one time restricted due to fear that it would take trade from neighbouring Newcastle upon Tyne, which was the region's leading port at the time; its trade guilds resented trade outside of the city, so much so that coal mined in North Shields within 300 ft of the river had to be transported on land 8 miles to Newcastle to be loaded onto boats. The Low Light lighthouse The most striking buildings are the now defunct High Light and Low Light lighthouses which, in the 18th and 19th centuries, provided a line of sight for vessels entering a fairly treacherous river mouth. Until the north and south piers were built many ships foundered on the treacherous rocks known as the 'Black Middens', which lie to the east of the quay and can be seen at low tide. The site actually has an original Old High Light and Old Low Light as well as a slightly differently positioned later High Light and Low Light, so called because they were positioned low (at river level on the quay) and high (on the bank top some 150 ft higher). The present quay was built in 1870 to accommodate the increase in fishing boats after the introduction of steam trawlers. It is still a working fishing port with a trade fish market; it is the largest English port for prawns. Its proximity to the Dogger Bank has meant that a number of fishing boats from Whitby and elsewhere on the north east coast have relocated there. Adjacent shops include many fresh fish outlets and fish processing, mainly crab and prawn, continues in industrial units. The Fish Quay was once the biggest kipper producer in the UK, but the fall in herring stocks has reduced the trade to a single smokery. A number of traditional smokehouses still exist but have been converted to other uses. Clifford's Fort, located on the Fish Quay, was built in the 17th century (1672) as a coastal defence against the Dutch, and also played a role during the Napoleonic Wars. The fort was named after Lord Clifford, a member of King Charles II's Cabal. It is now a scheduled monument. The Fish Quay declined in the 1980s as a result of problems in the fishing industry. Refurbishment of the area was begun by Tyne and Wear Development Corporation and then beginning in 2001 based on a consultancy report. The Old Low Light building has been converted into a heritage centre, which opened in 2015. Festival The annual North Shields Fish Quay Festival began in 1987 as a community event and by 2001 had been renamed Window on the World (WOW). It brought in big-name music acts and by 2002 had a budget of ¬£350,000 and was contributing an estimated ¬£11 million to the local economy. For 2003, on cost grounds, the festival became the Fish Bay Family Festival and was relocated to east of the Fish Quay. In 2006 North Tyneside Council decided to suspend the festival because of concerns about safety since the area was being redeveloped, and recommended that it should become a heritage festival. It has not resumed; the Mouth of the Tyne Festival, which is held jointly by South Shields and Tynemouth, is now the local annual festival.

It lies south-east of London, east of Brighton and east of Lewes. Hastings is to the south-east and Bexhill-on-Sea to the south. Battle is in the designated High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and is a tourist destination and commuter town for white collar workers in the City of London.https://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/property- news/where-to-live-in-sussex-six-of-the-best-commuter-villages-offering-good- transport-links-and-a106561.html The parish population was 6,048 according to the 2001 census, increasing to 6,673 with the 2011 Census. Battle is the site of the Battle of Hastings, where William, Duke of Normandy, defeated King Harold II to become William I in 1066. History In 1066, the area was known for its salt production, with today's Netherfield ward within a large wealthy ancient hundred called Hailesaltede.Netherfield: A Place to Defend. Accessed September 2020.Open Domesday: Netherfield. Accessed September 2020. The town of Battle was gradually built around the Abbey, and later developed a reputation for the quality of the gunpowder produced in the area. The first gunpowder mill in Battle was built in 1676 when John Hammond was granted permission to build a mill on land owned by the Abbey. A gunpowder works was located in Powdermill Lane ‚Äì the remains of which have been converted into a hotel. In 1722 Daniel Defoe described the town as being \\"remarkable for little now, but for making the finest gun-powder, and the best perhaps in Europe\\". The Duke of Cleveland refused to renew the licence in 1847 after many mishaps,Guy Fawkes including one occasion in 1798 on which more than 15 tonnes of gunpowder were left in the oven for too long and exploded. In the mid-18th century, the town supported five watchmakers in the High Street. Battle was the birthplace in 1799 of Eliza Acton, author of the pioneering Modern Cookery for Private Families (1845) This continued to sell well for the rest of the century. Its lists of ingredients, cooking times and other innovations provided a model for the cookery section of the best-selling Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management (1861).Ray, Elizabeth. \\"Acton, Eliza\\".

The local Battel Bonfire Boyes is claimed to be the oldest of the Sussex Bonfire Societies.Battel Bonfire Boyes The importance of Bonfire Night in Battle is that it is located in the wooded Weald of Sussex. Most of the area was heavily wooded, which provided oak and other timbers for Navy shipyards, power for making cannons (shipped to Portsmouth or Chatham), cannonballs and gunpowder. Battle was a refuge in World War I, and tunnels still exist, leading from various fields and cellars to Battle Abbey itself. However, they are deemed unsafe and are now closed. Governance Battle is governed at the lowest level by Battle Town Council, consisting of 17 elected councillors who meet on the third Tuesday of each month. The council is responsible for street lighting, allotments and recreational areas. It provides a local voice to the district and county councils. It is split into four wards: Marley, Netherfield, Telham and Watch Oak, of which Marley was the only one contested in the 2007 election. The vacant seats in the remaining wards have since been filled by co-option. Rother District council provides the next level of government with services such as refuse collection, planning consent, leisure amenities and council tax collection. The parish of Battle falls within three wards. The main town of Battle makes up Battle town ward. The south-eastern area of the parish, which includes the village of Telham, lies within Crowhurst ward. The north-western area, which includes the village of Netherfield, lies within Darwell ward. Crowhurst ward provides a single councillor, the other two wards provide two councillors to Rother District council. In the May 2007 election, Battle town ward elected two Liberal Democrats, Darwell ward elected one Conservative and one independent councillor. Crowhurst ward was won by the Conservative candidate. The electoral ward for this area had a population at the 2011 census of 5,312. East Sussex County Council is the third tier of government, providing education, libraries and highway maintenance. Battle falls within the Battle and Crowhurst ward. Kathryn Margaret Field, Liberal Democrat, was elected in the May 2005 election with 48.8% of the vote. The UK Parliament constituency for Battle is Bexhill and Battle. Huw Merriman (Conservative) was elected in the May 2015 election. At European level, Battle is represented by the South- East region, which holds ten seats in the European Parliament. The June 2004 election returned four Conservatives, two Liberal Democrats, two UK Independence, one Labour and one Green, none of whom lives in East Sussex. Landmarks Battle Abbey Telham Hill is about one mile (1.6 km) south-east of Senlac Hill, in East Sussex, England. It was from Telham Hill that William the Conqueror's army first caught sight of the English army forming up on Senlac Hill, for the battle of Hastings, 14 October 1066. In the later 19th century it was owned and farmed by Samuel Carter as part of his Quarry Hill estate. The abbey is historically known as Battle Abbey. It and the abbey church were initially dedicated to St Martin, sometimes known as the \\"Apostle of the Gauls\\". The abbey was founded to commemorate the battle, and dedicated in 1095. The high altar of the Abbey church was reputedly on the spot where Harold died. The Abbey gateway is still the dominant feature of the south end of the main street, although little remains of the rest of the Abbey buildings. The remaining cloisters, part of the west range, were leased to Battle Abbey School shortly after World War I, and the school remains in occupancy to this day. Battle is famed for its old fashioned but bustling High Street, with many shops and restaurants available either side.https://www.visit1066country.com/destinations/battle/food-and-drink There are three Sites of Special Scientific Interest within the parish: *Blackhorse Quarry, a site of palaeontological interest which has produced many fossil bones and teeth including Iguanodon and crocodiles. *Hemingfold Meadow is a site of biological interest consisting of two meadows with nationally rare grassland species. *Darwell Wood is partially within the parish which is another site of biological importance as an example of hornbeam coppice with oak standards. Transport Battle is linked to Hastings and London by the A2100 (A21). This section of the A2100 was the original A21. Battle railway station (designed by William Tress) lies on the Hastings Line, north of Crowhurst and south of Robertsbridge. There was once a station known as Mountfield Halt between Battle and Robertsbridge but this closed on 6 October 1969. The station is managed by and the services are provided by Southeastern.

It is down the line from London Charing Cross and is situated between and stations. It is in Travelcard Zone 6.  History  The station was opened on 2 March 1868 by the South Eastern Railway (SER), when the SER opened its cut-off line between Chislehurst and Sevenoaks. Previously, trains between London and Tunbridge Wells had taken a circuitous route via Redhill. The line was widened and the station rebuilt in 1904, expanding to six platforms. Third rail electrification reached Orpington in 1925, and extended to Sevenoaks in 1935.Southern Electric by G.T.Moody page 56 About this time the Southern Heights Light Railway was proposed, which would have diverged from the main line south of Orpington and finished at . Crofton Roman Villa was partly destroyed by a railway cutting in the late 1800s but was rediscovered in 1926 when work was carried out to the area to the west of the station entrance as an entrance to a new council building. Platforms 7 and 8 were built in the early 1990s on the site of former carriage sidings. In 2008, the station became fully accessible following the opening of a new footbridge providing lift access to all platforms. In 2013, the former steam locomotive shed (closed for steam in 1926; in use as sidings until 1960) is still standing, converted to offices (sited adjacent to platform 8). In 2014 the car park was rebuilt with 2 storeys to increase capacity. Layout The station has eight platforms. Platform 1 is a bay platform which is only occasionally used for Thameslink services. Platforms 2-5 are through platforms. Platform 2 is used for fast services to Charing Cross or Cannon Street . Platforms 3 and 4 are an island, 3 used by trains towards Ashford International or Tunbridge Wells and 4 by stopping services from Sevenoaks to Charing Cross or Cannon Street. Platform 5 hosts the Sevenoaks slows. Bay platforms 6-8 are for stopping services towards Charing Cross, London Victoria, Cannon Street and Luton/Bedford. At the country end, the four tracks become two. At the London end there is a four-road sidings, where trains are stabled and cleaned.

It was capable of nearly and eight were made with a price tag of ¬£1574. Made in greater numbers was the 1962 SX1000 based on the Mini. The first cars were built by grafting the Ogle glass fibre body to a customer supplied Mini. The conversion cost ¬£550 plus the customer supplied base car. Later in 1962, complete cars became available with the 997 cc Cooper version costing ¬£1176. Any of the Mini engines could be specified up to the Mini Cooper S unit which topped out at . The cars were fully equipped and featured a padded dashboard for increased safety. It is thought that 66 were made, with Jack Brabham buying one for his wife Betty for their first anniversary. Following David Ogle's death, it was decided to cease car production with the remaining parts being used up. A batch intended for the United States was converted to right- hand drive and sold onto the home market. It is thought the last one left the factory as late as 1964. The moulds were sold in 1966 to Norman Fletcher, a boat builder in West Bromwich, West Midlands, who exhibited a Fletcher GT at the 1967 Racing Car Show. The final car was the SX250, an updated Daimler Dart built in 1962.

They are known as one of the zuggot (\\"couples\\"): Shemaiah and Abtalion; Shemaiah holding the title of nasi, whilst Abtalion holding the office of Av Beit Din.Mishnah (Hagigah 2:2) Biography Abtalion and Shemaiah were converts to Judaism or the descendants of converts; by tradition they were descended from King Sennacherib of Assyria.Yoma 71b; Gittin 57b; Yerushalmi Moed Kattan 3 81b; see Weiss, Dor Dor we-Dorshaw, i.1, and Landau, p. 319 Despite this, they were influential and beloved. The Talmud relates that once, when the high priest was being escorted home from the Temple by the people, at the close of a Day of Atonement, the crowd deserted him upon the approach of Abtalion and Shemaiah and followed them.Yoma 71b However, Graetz has argued that neither Shemaiah nor Abtalion was of Gentile descent, although both were Alexandrians.Geschichte iii. 171 According to the Mishnah, both Shemaiah and Abtalion studied Torah under Simeon ben Shetach.Pirkei Avot 1:9-10 He was a leader of the Pharisees in the 1st century BCE and president of the Sanhedrin before the reign of Herod the Great. He and his colleague Abtalion are termed the gedolei ha-dor (the great men of the age)Pesahim 66a and darshanim (exegetes).Pesahim 70b Hillel the Elder was a contemporary of Shemaiah and Abtalion, and regularly attended their lectures.Babylonian Talmud (Yoma 35b; Pesahim 66a) Of the political life of Shemaiah, only one incident is reported. When Herod on his own responsibility had put to death the leader of the national party in Galilee, Hyrcanus II permitted the Sanhedrin to cite him before the tribunal. Herod appeared, but in royal purple robes, whereupon the members of the Sanhedrin lost courage. Only Shemaiah was brave enough to say: \\"He who is summoned here on a capital charge appears like one who would order us to execution straightway if we should pronounce him guilty. Yet I can blame him less than you and the king, since ye permit such a travesty of justice. Know then that he before whom ye now tremble will some day deliver you to the executioner.\\" This tradition is found twice, in JosephusAntiquities of the Jews xiv. 9, ¬ß 4 and the Talmud.Sanhedrin 19, where the name is altered (compare Gr√§tz, \\"Gesch.\\" iii. 711) The tombs of Shemaiah and Abtalyon are located in Jish, a Maronite Christian village in the Galilee.The Guide to Israel, Zev Vilnay, Jerusalem, 1972, p. 539. In Josephus Shemaiah and Abtalion may be identical to Sameas and Pollion who are mentioned by Josephus.Antiquities 15:1 ¬ß 1, 15:10 ¬ß 4 Shemaiah is named by Josephus under his Greek name Sameas (). According to Josephus, he led the Sanhedrin during the transition period between the Hasmonean dynasty and the rise of King Herod the Great.Josephus, Antiquities (14.9.4)Max Radin, \\"Roman Knowledge of Jewish Literature\\", The Classical Journal, vol. 13, no. 3 (Dec., 1917), p. 164 (note 2) concludes: \\"From the combination Pollio and Sameas, in the passage quoted, it is evident that Josephus had in mind the pair Abtalyon and Shemaiah, who preceded Hillel and Shammai as heads of the Sanhedrin (Mishnah Avot 1).\\" Shemaiah is described by Josephus as a disciple of Pollion the Pharisee, who, in rabbinic literature, is known as Abtalion.Josephus, Antiquities (15.1.1). This view follows the opinion of Joseph Derenbourg (see Louis H. Feldman, \\"The Identity of Pollio, the Pharisee, in Josephus\\", The Jewish Quarterly Review, vol. 49, no. 1 [Jul., 1958], p. 53), unlike the opinion of others who thought that Pollion was to be identified with Hillel the Elder (see Abraham Rees, The Cyclop√¶dia; or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature, vol. 18, London 1819, s.v. Hillel). Herod held both Abtalion and Shemaiah in great honour.  Quotes  * Love work. Hate [having to assume] authority. Do not make yourself known to the government.

Biography =Early life= Marcel Grandjany was born in Paris and began the study of the harp at the age of eight with Henriette Reni√©. At age eleven, he was admitted to the Conservatoire de Paris, where he studied with Alphonse Hasselmans, winning the coveted Premier Prix at age thirteen. =Career= At seventeen he made his debut with the Concerts Lamoureux Orchestra, and gave his first solo recital, winning immediate acclaim. He appeared with Maurice Ravel in Paris in 1913. His London debut was in 1922 and his New York debut in 1924. He appeared as soloist with major orchestras under the direction of Gabriel Piern√©, Alfred Cortot, Walter Damrosch, Serge Koussevitzky, George Szell, Fritz Reiner and Vladimir Golschmann, among others. From 1921 to 1926, he headed the harp department of the Fontainebleau Summer School. He moved to the United States in 1936 and was appointed head of the Harp Department at the Juilliard School in 1938, where he taught until his death in 1975. In 1943 he was chosen to organize the harp department of the Conservatoire de musique et d'art dramatique √† Montr√©al, and for the next twenty years he traveled monthly from New York to Montr√©al. He was also head of the harp department at the Manhattan School of Music from 1956 to 1967. Notable students include American harpists Nancy Allen, Catherine Gotthoffer, and Eileen Malone. He also taught Anna Clark, the second wife of William A. Clark; she was also his patron.Bill Dedman, Paul Clark Newell, Jr., Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Loss of one of the World's Greatest Fortunes, London: Atlantic Books (2013), p. 154 At the First International Harp Contest in Israel in 1959, Pierre Jamet of France proposed the formation of an international association of harpists. Grandjany undertook to see what he could do in the United States and chaired a committee of leading harpists. The Founding Committee met for the first time on 3 December 1962 in his apartment at 235 W. 71 St, Apartment 32. Over the years, he was a member of the Board of Directors, Regional Director, Chapter Chairman and President of the New York Chapter. He generously performed at AHS conferences; in 1964 at the first conference and in 1967, a solo recital which was his last public performance. He supported the educational goals of the Society vigorously and delighted in the American Harp Society's growth and community. He died in New York City.

Directors The founding director, Sune Nordgren was appointed in 1997 and was integral in Baltic's pre-launch period, having overseen the building of the gallery and was there for the first one million visitors. After almost six years, Nordgren left to take up a new post as founding director of the National Museum for Art, Architecture and Design, Oslo, Norway. He was briefly succeeded by Stephen Snoddy who was only with the organisation for one year. Snoddy was succeeded as director by Peter Doroshenko in 2005, intended to increase visitor numbers and resolve the financial situation.Baltic's new director unveils a vision of skateboards, football and art in the lavatories Doroshenko organized several exhibitions during his time at the Baltic, including Spank the Monkey.Spank the Monkey- BALTIC In November 2007, Doroshenko left the gallery to head up the PinchukArtCentre in Kiev, Ukraine.Baltic Boss Quits for Ukraine Job Since 2008, the director was Godfrey Worsdale, founding director of the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art.

The photograph entitled Klara and Edda belly-dancing (which, along with the rest of the installation, is part of the Sir Elton John Photography Collection) features two naked young girls and had previously been exhibited around the world without objections. The installation, which had been scheduled for a four-month exhibition, opened with the remaining photographs but closed after just nine days at the request of the owner.

It was extended in 1957 by the addition of an animal feed mill. The mill was closed in 1981.Facts about the Baltic Flour Mills It was one of a number of mills located along the banks of the Tyne, all of which, due to their size, were prominent local landmarks. The Spillers mill just downstream from the Baltic on the north bank of the river was demolished in 2011.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-13616485 Another large mill was owned by the CWS and was located just upstream of Dunston Staiths. The site of this mill and the adjacent CWS soap works is now occupied by a residential development. Dominic Williams of Ellis Williams Architects won an architectural design competition, managed by RIBA Competitions, in the mid-1990s to convert the 1950s Baltic Flour Mill into a centre for art. After ten years in the planning and a capital investment of ¬£50m, including ¬£33.4m from the Arts Council Lottery Fund, Baltic opened to the public at midnight on Saturday 13 July 2002.Baltic Blunders - the New Statesman The inaugural exhibition, B.OPEN, had work by Chris Burden, Carsten Holler, Julian Opie, Jaume Plensa and Jane and Louise Wilson and attracted over 35,000 visitors in the first week.Baltic Website An early exhibit of the Japanese artist Yoshitomo Nara, a Japanese girl, can be seen in the window of the east elevation.

Blaschke products were introduced by . They are related to Hardy spaces. Definition A sequence of points (a_n) inside the unit disk is said to satisfy the Blaschke condition when :\\\\sum_n (1-|a_n|) <\\\\infty. Given a sequence obeying the Blaschke condition, the Blaschke product is defined as :B(z)=\\\\prod_n B(a_n,z) with factors :B(a,z)=\\\\frac{|a|}{a}\\\\;\\\\frac{a-z}{1 - \\\\overline{a}z} provided a ‚â† 0. Here \\\\overline{a} is the complex conjugate of a. When a = 0 take B(0,z) = z.

Szeg≈ë theorem A theorem of G√°bor Szeg≈ë states that if f is in H^1, the Hardy space with integrable norm, and if f is not identically zero, then the zeroes of f (certainly countable in number) satisfy the Blaschke condition. Finite Blaschke products Finite Blaschke products can be characterized (as analytic functions on the unit disc) in the following way: Assume that f is an analytic function on the open unit disc such that f can be extended to a continuous function on the closed unit disc : \\\\overline{\\\\Delta}= \\\\\\\\{z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\,|\\\\, |z|\\\\le 1\\\\\\\\} which maps the unit circle to itself. Then ∆í is equal to a finite Blaschke product : B(z)=\\\\zeta\\\\prod_{i=1}^n\\\\left({{z-a_i}\\\\over {1-\\\\overline{a_i}z}}\\\\right)^{m_i} where Œ∂ lies on the unit circle and mi is the multiplicity of the zero ai, |ai< 1\\\\. In particular, if ∆í satisfies the condition above and has no zeros inside the unit circle then ∆í is constant (this fact is also a consequence of the maximum principle for harmonic functions, applied to the harmonic function log(|∆í(z)|)).

The generalized affix description system introduced by ispell has since been imitated by other spelling checkers such as MySpell. Like most computerized spelling checkers, ispell works by reading an input file word by word, stopping when a word is not found in its dictionary. Ispell then attempts to generate a list of possible corrections and presents the incorrect word and any suggestions to the user, who can then choose a correction, replace the word with a new one, leave it unchanged, or add it to the dictionary. Ispell pioneered the idea of a programming interface, which was originally intended for use by emacs. Other applications have since used the feature to add spell- checking to their own interface, and GNU Aspell has adopted the same interface so that it can be used with the same set of applications. There are ispell dictionaries for most widely spoken Western languages. Ispell is available under a specific open-source license.

Kyne's novel Three Godfathers. Tokyo Godfathers was the third animated film directed by Kon and the second which he both wrote and directed. Keiko Nobumoto, noted for being the creator of the Wolf's Rain series and a head scriptwriter for Cowboy Bebop, co-wrote the script with Kon. Tokyo Godfathers received an Excellence Prize at the 2003 Japan Media Arts Festival. It also won Best Animation Film at the 58th Mainichi Film Awards. Plot One Christmas Eve after watching a children's performance of the Nativity scene, three homeless people ‚Äì a middle-aged alcoholic named Gin, a former drag queen named Hana, and a dependent teenage runaway girl named Miyuki ‚Äì discover an abandoned newborn while searching through the garbage for presents. Deposited with the unnamed baby is a note asking the unknown finder to take good care of her and a bag containing clues to the parents' identity. The trio sets out to find the baby's parents. The baby is named by Hana, based on the Japanese translation of Silent Night literally meaning \\"pure child\\", as she is found on Christmas Eve. Outside a cemetery, the group encounters a high-ranking yakuza boss trapped under his car. The man happens to know the owner of the club where Kiyoko's mother used to work; his daughter is going to be marrying the club's owner that day. At the wedding reception, the groom tells them that the baby's mother is a former bar girl named Sachiko. He gives them Sachiko's address, but the party is interrupted when a maid, revealed to be a Latino hitman in disguise, attempts to shoot the bride's father. The hitman kidnaps Miyuki and baby Kiyoko while holding them hostage at gunpoint and takes them back to his home. There, Miyuki befriends the hitman's wife who happens to have a child of her own and they begin bonding-(despite their language barrier). While looking through old photo albums, Miyuki tearfully confesses to fleeing her home after stabbing her over-controlling father Ishida when her beloved cat Angel went missing-(believing that he had gotten rid of it). Hana searches for Miyuki and Kiyoko while Gin takes care of an elderly homeless man who is dying in the street. After giving Gin a little red bag, the old man peacefully passes away. Some teenagers show up and beat up Gin and the dead old man's corpse. Meanwhile, Hana finds the girls and they go off to find a place to stay. They go to Angel Tower, a club where Hana had worked at before being quitting her job for assaulting a rude and intoxicated customer years ago. Gin, who was rescued by another member of the club, is also there. While there, it's learned that Hana had become homeless when her lover Ken had died from injuring himself after slipping on a bar of soap in the bathroom. The trio set out to find Sachiko's house, but they discover that it has been torn down. They are informed of the unhappy relationship between Sachiko and her husband, who is a gambling alcoholic. The group rests at a store until they are told to leave by the clerk. Hana collapses, and is taken by Gin and Miyuki to the hospital. Once at the hospital, Gin finds his estranged daughter, who is also named Kiyoko, working as a nurse. Hana berates Gin in front of his daughter and storms out of the hospital, with Miyuki following behind with baby Kiyoko in hand. Hana and Miyuki find Sachiko about to jump off a bridge. Sachiko insists that her husband got rid of the baby without her knowledge, and that they return the baby to her. Gin finds Sachiko's husband, who confirms a TV report Gin saw earlier that Kiyoko was actually stolen by Sachiko from the hospital. They chase after Sachiko and Kiyoko. After an intense car chase, Miyuki chases Sachiko to the top of a building. Sachiko reveals she became pregnant in hopes it would bring her closer to her husband. When her baby was stillborn, she decided to kidnap Kiyoko from the hospital's nursery, thinking, in her grief, the baby was hers. As Sachiko is about to jump off the building intending to commit suicide with Kiyoko in her hands, her husband comes out of his apartment, located just across the street, and begs her to start over with him. Sachiko jumps off nevertheless, but Miyuki manages to catch her before she falls, but then Sachiko accidentally drops Kiyoko. Hana jumps off the building after Kiyoko, catches the baby, and lands safely due to a miraculous gust of wind. Hana, Miyuki, and Gin are taken to the hospital. Miyuki hands Gin his cigarettes and drops the old man's small red bag on the floor, revealing a winning lottery ticket. Kiyoko's real parents want to ask the trio to become her godparents. When a police inspector introduces them to the trio, the inspector is revealed to be Miyuki's father.

Movie critic George Peluranee notes that \\"Tokyo Godfathers is a film that shows the small yet significant ties that each of us have with supposed strangers, and tells well the story of miracles, family, love, and forgiveness.\\" Susan Napier points out that Tokyo Godfathers is part of a trend in anime and manga as depicting families in an increasingly dark fashion, showcasing the problems with traditional families, and attempts by people to construct a \\"pseudo-family\\" out of an increasingly fragmented and isolating modern Japanese society. It is put forth that despite the seeming criticisms of traditional families throughout the film, it ends with a more conservative feeling as everyone returns to their traditional/original families. Despite its seemingly traditional ending, the film offers a more radical version of family. Throughout the story these three homeless vagabonds unknowingly form a \\"pseudo-family\\" to protect themselves from the outside world and to overcome their personal demons.

Ashok Motors was incorporated in 1948 as a company to assemble and manufacture Austin cars from England, and the company was named after the founder's only son, Ashok Saran. The company had its headquarters in Dibrugarh, with the manufacturing plant in Dibrugarh. The company was engaged in the assembly and distribution of Austin A40 passenger cars in India. =Under Leyland= Raghunandan Saran had previously negotiated with Leyland Motors of England for assembly of commercial vehicles as he envisioned commercial vehicle were more in need at that time than were passenger cars. The company later under Madras State Government and other shareholders finalised for an investment and technology partner, and thus Leyland Motors joined in 1954 with equity participation, changing the name of the company to Ashok Leyland. Ashok Leyland then started manufacturing commercial vehicles. Under Leyland's management with British expatriate and Indian executives the company grew in strength to become one of India's foremost commercial vehicle manufacturers. The collaboration ended sometime in 1975 but the holding of British Leyland, now a major British Auto Conglomerate as a result of several mergers, agreed to assist in technology, which continued until the 1980s.

Hythane engines may be expected in the near future. =Hybrid technology= Plugin Hybrid Bus In the Auto Expo 2010 at Delhi, Ashok Leyland launched India's first plug-in CNG hybrid bus, HYBUS. The hybrid bus offered 20‚Äì30% fuel saving over conventional buses powered by internal combustion engine, and were more eco-friendly than regular CNG buses, as a result of its hybrid technology that combined conventional CNG engine with electric propulsion system. The propulsion system was powered by lithium-ion battery. The other useful features of the bus included ultra-low entry at 390mm with kneeling option, noise-free rear engine, front and rear air suspensions and retractable ramp for wheel-chair entry. Some innovative pedestrian safety concepts were also introduced in the bus, like the sound and light alerts while the bus moves, a camera-assisted reversing aid for the driver and night time highlighters near the tail lights. Non-plugin Hybrid Bus At the Delhi Auto Expo 2016, Ashok Leyland introduced an advanced non- plugin version of HYBUS. It is claimed to be India's first non-plugin series hybrid bus. The bus uses ultra-capacitors to store energy, a feature that improves power density and fuel efficiency, because energy is stored electrostatically and does not involve chemical reactions. The ultra- capacitors are claimed to be 4‚Äì5 times more durable than conventional lithium- ion batteries. HYBUS is powered by an H-Series 6-cylinder diesel (BS IV compliant) engine that is not used to drive the vehicle ahead, but to charge the ultra-capacitors that powers the 150 kW electric motor. Automatic start- stop is used to decrease the overall engine idling time. The bus can restart using the stored energy when the engine is off. The fuel-efficiency of the engine thus increases and NVH (Noise-vibration-harshness) levels decrease. The buses and trucks are set to feature a new electronic shift-by-wire transmission technology as well as electronic-controlled engine management for greater fuel efficiency. Ashok Leyland focuses on improving fuel efficiency without affecting automotive power, and the vehicles will have a 5% improvement on fuel efficiency. Ashok Leyland is also developing electric batteries and bio-fuel modes. =Electric Technology= In 2016 the company launched the country's first indigenously produced fully electric bus, called Circuit. The bus is a zero-emission vehicle that can run 120 km on a single charge, and has an alert system that can signal if the bus is low on power. The bus will be introduced under the National Electric Mobility Plan with an aim of 20% penetration of electric or hybrid vehicles by 2020. =Euro 6 Truck= AT the Delhi Auto Expo 2016, the company showcased its first indigenously produced Euro 6 truck 4940. The truck is powered by the company's flagship range of engine, Neptune, which is an 8l engine that produces 400 hp and 1600Nm of torque. The truck is designed to meet Euro 6 norms. =iEGR= In 2017, the company showcased iEGR (intelligent exhaust gas recirculation) technology for its trucks and buses to meet BS-IV emission standards. The technology also promises other advantages like better fuel efficiency than BS- III trucks, and power transmission up to 400 HP.Ashok Leyland showcases tech to upgrade vehicles to meet BS-IV fuel norms. The Hindu BusinessLine (21 April 2017). Retrieved on 25 December 2018. =iBUS= Ashok Leyland announced iBUS in the beginning of 2008, as part of the future for the country's increasingly traffic-clogged major cities. Its Rs 60-lakh iBus is a feature-filled, low- floor concept bus for the metros revealed during the Auto Expo 2008 in India. This low-floored iBus will have the first of its kind features, including anti-lock braking system, electronic engine management and passenger infotainment. The executive class has an airline like ambiance with wide LCD screens, reading lights, audio speakers and, for the first time, Internet on the move. A GPS system enables vehicle tracking and display of dynamic route information on LCD screens, which can also support infotainment packages including live data and news. The bus will probably be equipped with an engine from the new Neptune family, which Ashok Leyland also introduced at this exhibition, which is ready for the BS4/Euro 4 emission regulations and can be upgraded to Euro 5. The ibus of Ashok leyland have hybrid technology Financials Ashok Leyland Corporate Building in Guindy, Chennai The company has maintained its profitable track record for 60 years. The annual revenue of the company was US$3.2 billion in 2016‚Äì17. Selling 140,457 light, medium, heavy vehicles in 2016‚Äì17, Ashok Leyland was one of India's largest exporters of medium and heavy duty trucks. It is also one of the largest private sector employers in India, with about 12,000 employees working in 9 factories and offices spread across the globe. In 2013‚Äì14, the company posted a very modest profit after tax of Rs. 290million which was made possible after the selling of real estate and other surplus land and related assets. The company did not declare any dividends for the financial year 2013‚Äì14, which is also a first in its 60-year history. The company has increased its rated capacity to 105,000 vehicles per annum. Further investment plans include putting up two new plants ‚Äì one in Uttarakhand in North India and a bus body building unit in middle- east Asia are fast afoot. It already has a sizeable presence in African countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt and South Africa. Despite its stellar sales growth and profitability results in the last few years, there has been a sharp fall in the share price of Ashok Leyland in the financial year 2018-19 owing to several factors such as resignation of the MD - Mr. Vinod Dasari, Cyclical trend in the Indian truck and commercial vehicle industry, etc. Overall results of the company are still very promising. Exports On 11 June 2012, Ashok Leyland supplied 100 Falcon buses to Ghana for $7.6 million (about Rs 420 million). Hinduja Group flagship company Ashok Leyland has been awarded the first overseas order worth $6 million for its vestibule buses from Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC). Every year Ashok Leyland exports about 12000 trucks to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka Which has 80% increase in demand every year.

The film was nominated for the Empire Award for Best British Film. It is among a group of roughly contemporaneous films that deal with concerns over \\"Broken Britain\\" and a fear of \\"hoodies\\". Some of the close up scenes were filmed at Frensham Small Pond. Plot Nursery school teacher Jenny and her boyfriend Steve journey to a remote lake in the wooded English countryside. Hiking to the lakeside, they meet Adam, a young boy gathering insects. Relaxing beside the lake, the setting is disrupted by a group of delinquent teenagers, who have ridden their bicycles to a spot within a few metres of the young couple. After they sleep overnight in their tent, they find food supplies infested with insects and their car tyre damaged by a bottle left behind by the teens. Returning to town for breakfast, Steve spots a house with bikes that he thinks belongs to the teens. When no one answers the door, Steve walks into the house, narrowly escaping as the surly homeowner returns. Back at the lake, Steve goes scuba diving while Jenny sleeps on the shore. Steve returns to find the bag with their car keys, phone and wallet is missing, soon confirming that their car is gone. Returning to town on foot, they avoid collision with their car, driven recklessly through the woods by the gang's leader Brett. Finding the gang in the woods after nightfall, Steve demands the return of his belongings, only to be pounced by the knife-wielding teens. In the scuffle, Brett's rottweiler Bonnie is mortally knifed, provoking Brett into wanting revenge. The couple grab the keys and drive off, but the gang throws stones at them, causing Steve to crash the car. With Steve trapped, Jenny is forced to run for help. At daybreak, Jenny sees Steve tied to a rock with barbed wire. Brett orders each reluctant teen to torture him. When Paige, a female gang member, records Steve's torture on her phone, the gang realize they have no choice but to kill Steve. This allows Jenny to show herself and give chase while Steve buys time to free himself. Jenny evades the gang and finds Steve, but is unable to nurse his fatal wounds. She finds an engagement ring, leading Steve to propose even as he is in severe pain. Jenny runs off to find help and accidentally steps on a large spike. Her scream catches the gang's attention. Steve dies from his injuries. Jenny runs into Adam and thinks he will help her but he ends up texting the gang their location. They tie Jenny and Steve's body to a pile of wood. Brett forces Adam to light the bonfire while Paige films. Jenny is able to escape, and the gang burn Adam to death in retaliation. Jenny continues to evade the gang, killing gang member Cooper who was actually attempting to help her. After finding the body, Brett is thrown into further rage and beats another gang member to death, causing Paige to run away from him. Jenny reaches a road and is picked up by a driver who is looking for his brother Ricky, another gang member. When the driver exits the van to talk with the gang members, Jenny panics and steals the van, speeds off, and intentionally runs over Paige while making her way back to town. Jenny makes it to town, crashes into a fence at a large backyard party, and collapses. Awaking, she finds herself being comforted by an unknown woman, her husband and the party guests and realizes she is in Brett's house. Jenny is lead to the bathroom after saying that she feels sick, and Brett's father Jon notices the van on his lawn before one of the parents receives a call informing him of the dead gang members, who are the children of the adults at the house. A commotion begins in the house and the bathroom door is kicked open as Jenny is confronted by Brett, Jon, and the other party guests. Brett has convinced the adults that Jenny and Steve sadistically murdered Bonnie and the gang members. Jenny begs Jon to call the police and attacks him with a razor she found in the bathroom. Jon quickly subdues her. Jon tells Brett to go upstairs, slaps him when he tries to say something, and takes Jenny back into the bathroom with two other men. Brett shuts the door of his room, blocking out her screams. He deletes the videos of the gang's crimes from Paige's phone, puts on Steve's sunglasses, and stares blankly into a mirror. Cast Critical reception On Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, 79% of 28 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"A brutal and effective British hoodie-horror that, despite the clich√©s, stays on the right side of scary.\\" Dennis Harvey reviewed the film for Variety and said that it was \\"an effectively harrowing Brit thriller-cum-horror pic,\\" comparing it to Last House on the Left and Lord of the Flies. The Guardians Peter Bradshaw drew parallels with Deliverance, Straw Dogs and Blue Remembered Hills, and stated that \\"this looks to me like the best British horror film in years: nasty, scary and tight as a drum,\\" concluding that the film was \\"exceptionally well made, ruthlessly extreme, relentlessly upsetting.\\" Other critics, however, have savaged the film, denouncing it as an incitement to class prejudice against working class people in Britain. The Sun condemned the film's \\"nasty suggestion that all working-class people are thugs\\" while the Daily Telegraph concluded that \\"this ugly witless film expresses fear and loathing of ordinary English people\\". Owen Jones, in his book Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class cites the film at length as an example of media demonisation of proletarian youth via the \\"Chav\\" stereotype. He comments, \\"Here was a film arguing that the middle classes could no longer live alongside the quasi- bestial lower orders.\\" Eden Lake has been linked with other, roughly contemporaneous, films that deal with concerns over \\"Broken Britain\\" and a fear of \\"hoodies,\\" including Harry Brown, The Disappeared, Summer Scars, Outlaw, The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael, Cherry Tree Lane and Heartless.

The term is usually seen to have referred to the southern shores of the White Sea and the basin of the Northern Dvina River (Vienanjoki in Finnish) as well as, presumably, some of the surrounding areas. Today, those territories comprise a part of the Arkhangelsk Oblast of Russia, as well as the Kola Peninsula.  Norse voyagers in Bjarmaland  A Norwegian map of the voyage of Ohthere According to the Voyage of Ohthere (c. 890 CE), the Norwegian merchant Ottar (Ohthere) reported to king Alfred the Great that he had sailed for 15 days along the northern coast and then southwards, finally arriving at a great river, probably the Northern Dvina. At the estuary of the river dwelt the Beormas, who unlike the nomadic Sami peoples were sedentary, and their land was rich and populous. Ohthere did not know their language but he said that it resembled the language of the Sami people. The Bjarmians told Ohthere about their country and other countries that bordered it. Later, several expeditions were undertaken from Norway to Bjarmaland. In 920, Eric Bloodaxe made a Viking expedition, as well as Harald II of Norway and Haakon Magnusson of Norway, in 1090. The best known expedition was that of Tore Hund (Tore Dog) who together with some friends, arrived in Bjarmaland in 1026. They started to trade with the inhabitants and bought a great many pelts, whereupon they pretended to leave. Later, they made shore in secret, and plundered the burial site, where the Bjarmians had erected an idol of their god J√≥mali. This god had a bowl containing silver on his knees, and a valuable chain around his neck. Tore and his men managed to escape from the pursuing Bjarmians with their rich bounty.  Identification  The name Bjarmaland appears in Old Norse literature, possibly referring to the area where Arkhangelsk is presently situated, and where it was preceded by a Bjarmian settlement. The first appearance of the name occurs in an account of the travels of Ohthere of H√•logaland, which was written in about 890.Ohthere's voyage to Bjarmaland. Original text and its English translation. The name Permians is already found in the oldest document of the Rus', the Nestor's Chronicle (1000‚Äì1100). The names of other Uralic tribes are also listed including some Samoyedic peoples as well as the Veps, Cheremis, Mordvin, and Chudes.Angela Marcantonio: The Uralic Language Family: Facts, Myths and Statistics. Wiley, Hoboken/NJ 2002, p. 21 ff. The place-name Bjarmaland was also used later both by the German historian Adam of Bremen (11th century) and the Icelander Snorri Sturluson (1179‚Äì1241) in B√≥sa saga ok Herrau√∞s, reporting about its rivers flowing out to Gandvik. It is not clear if they reference the same Bjarmaland as was mentioned in the Voyage of Ohthere, however. The name of the Bjarmian god J√≥mali is so close to the word for \\"god\\" in most Finnic languages that Bjarmians were likely a Finnic group. In fact, languages belonging to other language groups have never been suggested within serious research. Olaus Magnus located Bjarmaland in the Kola Peninsula in his Carta marina et descriptio septentrionalium terrarum (1539), while Johannes Schefferus (1621‚Äì1679) identified it with Lappland.  Origin of the name: the Bjarmians  Bjarmians cannot be connected directly to any existing group of people living today, but it is likely that they were a separate group of Finnic speakers in the White Sea area. Toponyms and loan words in dialects in northern Russia indicate that Finnic speaking populations used to live in the area. Also Russian chronicles mention groups of people in the area associated with Finno-Ugric languages. Accordingly, many historians assume the terms and to derive from the Uralic word perm, which refers to \\"travelling merchants\\" and represents the Old Permic culture.Steinsland and Meulengracht 1998: 162. However, some linguists consider this theory to be speculative.Janne Saarikivi: Substrata Uralica. Studies in Finno-Ugric substrate in northern Russian dialects. Doctoral dissertation. Tartu 2006: 28 (online text ) Recent research on the Uralic substrate in northern Russian dialects suggests that several other Uralic groups besides the Permians, lived in Bjarmaland, assumed to have included the Viena Karelians, Sami and Kvens.Saarikivi 2006: 294‚Äì295. According to Helimski, the language spoken c. 1000 AD in the northern Archangel region, which he terms Lop', was closely related to but distinct from the Sami languages proper. That would fit Ottar's account perfectly. Bjarmian trade reached southeast to Bolghar, by the Volga River, where the Bjarmians also interacted with Scandinavians and Fennoscandians, who had ventured southbound from the Baltic Sea area.  Background  The Northern Land (Apollinary Vasnetsov, 1899). Modern historians suppose that the wealth of the Bjarmians was due to their profitable trade along the Northern Dvina, the Kama River and the Volga to Bolghar and other trading settlements in the south. Along this route, silver coins and other merchandise were exchanged for pelts and walrus tusks brought by the Bjarmians. In fact, burial sites in modern Perm Krai are the richest source of Sasanian and Sogdian silverware from Iran. Further north, the Bjarmians traded with the Sami. It seems that the Scandinavians made some use of the Dvina trade route, in addition to the Volga trade route and Dnieper trade route. In 1217, two Norwegian traders arrived in Bjarmaland to buy pelts; one of the traders continued further south to pass to Russia in order to arrive in the Holy Land, where he intended to take part in the Crusades. The second trader who remained was killed by the Bjarmians. This caused Norwegian officials to undertake a campaign of retribution into Bjarmaland which they pillaged in 1222. The 13th century seems to have seen the decline of the Bjarmians, who became tributaries of the Novgorod Republic. While many Slavs fled the Mongol invasion northward, to Beloozero and Bjarmaland, the displaced Bjarmians sought refuge in Norway, where they were given land around the Malangen fjord by Haakon IV of Norway in 1240. More important for the decline was probably that, with the onset of the Crusades, the trade routes had found a more westerly orientation or shifted considerably to the south. When the Novgorodians founded Velikiy Ustiug, in the beginning of the 13th century, the Bjarmians had a serious competitor for the trade. More and more Pomors arrived in the area during the 14th and 15th centuries, which led to the final subjugation and assimilation of the Bjarmians by the Slavs. Later use The collaborationist Quisling regime planned to build Norwegian colonies in Northern Russia, following a future success of Operation Barbarossa, and which were to be named Bjarmaland; but these plans never came to be.Norway's Nazi Collaborators Sought Russia Colonies.

Etymology  The name Devadatta has the meaning god- given in Palƒ´ (cf. Latin Deodatus, Deusdedit; Lithuanian Dievoduotas; all also meaning god-given). It is composed from the stem form of deva and the past participle datta of the verb da, give, composed as a tatpurusa compound. In the Bhagavad Gƒ´tƒÅ, the conch shell used by Arjuna on the battle-field of Kurukshetra was named Devadatta. The name Devadatta is still used today.  Scholarship  = MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya research = According to Andrew Skilton, modern scholarship generally agrees that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya is the oldest extant Buddhist Vinaya.Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 48 According to Reginald Ray, the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya mentions the figure of Devadatta, but in a way that is different from the vinayas of the SthaviravƒÅda branch. According to this study, the earliest vinaya material common to all sects simply depicts Devadatta as a Buddhist saint who wishes for the monks to live a rigorous lifestyle.Ray, Reginald (1994). Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations. p. 168. (A condemned Saint: Devadatta), used by permission of Oxford University Press This has led Ray to regard the story of Devadatta as a legend produced by the Sthavira group.Ray, Reginald (1994). Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations. pp. 169‚Äì170. (A condemned Saint: Devadatta), used by permission of Oxford University Press However, as Bhikkhu Sujato has noted, the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya does indeed contain material depicting Devadatta as a schismatic figure trying to split the sangha. Sujato adds: \\"The only relevant difference is the grounds he is said to base his attempt on. Whereas the Sthavira Vinayas say he promulgated a set of ‚Äòfive points‚Äô, by which he tried to enforce an excessively ascetic lifestyle on the monks, the MahƒÅsa·πÖghika Vinaya omits the five points and attributes a much more comprehensive agenda to him.\\"Bhikkhu Sujato (2012), \\"Why Devadatta Was No Saint, A critique of Reginald Ray‚Äôs thesis of the ‚Äòcondemned saint‚Äô\\" Sujato further argues that \\"The fact that the Devadatta legend, at least the core episodes 13 and 14, is common to all six Vinayas including the MahƒÅsa·πÖghika suggests the legend arose among the presectarian community, and in all likelihood harks back to the time of the Buddha himself. \\"Bhikkhu Sujato (2012), \\"Why Devadatta Was No Saint, A critique of Reginald Ray‚Äôs thesis of the ‚Äòcondemned saint‚Äô\\" = Records from Chinese pilgrims to India = Faxian and other Chinese pilgrims who travelled to India in the early centuries of the current era recorded the continued existence of \\"Gotamaka\\" buddhists, followers of Devadatta. Gotamaka are also referred to in Pali texts of the second and fifth centuries of the current era. The followers of Devadatta are recorded to have honored all the Buddhas previous to ≈öƒÅkyamuni (Gautama Buddha), but not ≈öƒÅkyamuni himself. According to Faxian, Xuanzang and Yijing's writings, some people practised in a similar way and with the same books as common Buddhists, but followed the similar tapas and performed rituals to the past three buddhas and not ≈öƒÅkyamuni.‰ΩõÊïôÂºÄÂàõÊó∂ÊúüÁöÑ‰∏ÄÂú∫Ë¢´Ê≠™Êõ≤Ë¢´ÈÅóÂøò‰∫ÜÁöÑ‚ÄúË∑ØÁ∫øÊñó‰∫â‚Äù  TheravƒÅda portrayals of Devadatta  = Devadatta in the TheravƒÅda Vinaya = In Cullavagga section VII of the Vinayapi·π≠aka of the TheravƒÅdins which deals with schisms, it is told how Devadatta went forth along with a number of the Buddha's other relatives and clansmen.Horner, I.B. (1963). The book of discipline Vol. V (Cullavagga), London Luzac, pp. 259‚Äì285 In the first year he attained psychic power, but made no supermundane achievement. Looking round to see whom he could convince to honour him he decided to approach Prince AjƒÅtasattu, the heir to the Magadhan throne. Having psychic power he assumed the form of a young boy clad in snakes and sat in the Prince's lap, which very much impressed the prince, who became his disciple. AjƒÅtasattu began to send great offerings to Devadatta, and the latter became obsessed with his own worth, and began to have thoughts that it was he who should lead the Sangha, not the Buddha, and he didn't desist even though this thought brought down his psychic powers. When told about the offerings that Devadatta was receiving, the Buddha remarked that all these gains were only going towards his destruction, just as a plantain or a bamboo is destroyed by its fruit. Shortly thereafter, Devadatta asked the Buddha to retire and let him take over the running of the Sangha. The Buddha retorted that he did not even let his trusted disciples SƒÅriputta or MoggallƒÅna run the Sangha, much less one like him, who should be vomited like spittle, and he gave a special act of publicity about him, warning the monks that he had changed for the worse.Horner, I.B. (1963). The book of discipline Vol. V (Cullavagga), London Luzac, pp. 264‚Äì265 Seeing the danger in this, Devadatta approached Prince AjƒÅtasattu and encouraged him to kill his Father, the good King BimbisƒÅra, and meanwhile he would kill the Buddha. The King found out about his plan and gave over the Kingdom into the Prince's control. AjƒÅtasattu then gave mercenaries to Devadatta who ordered them to kill the Buddha, and in an elaborate plan to cover his tracks he ordered other men to kill the killers, and more to kill them and so on, but when they approached the Buddha they were unable to carry out their orders, and were converted instead. Devadatta kills the elephant Devadatta then tried to kill the Buddha himself by throwing a rock at him from on high, while the Buddha was walking on the slopes of a mountain. As this also failed he decided to have the elephant NƒÅ·∏∑ƒÅgiri intoxicated and let him loose on the Buddha while he was on almsround. However, the power of the Buddha's loving-kindness overcame the elephant. Devadatta then decided to create a schism in the order, and collected a few monk friends and demanded that the Buddha accede to the following rules for the monks: they should dwell all their lives in the forest, live entirely on alms obtained by begging, wear only robes made of discarded rags, dwell at the foot of a tree and abstain completely from fish and flesh. The Buddha refused to make any of these compulsory, however, and Devadatta went round blaming him, saying that he was living in abundance and luxury. Devadatta then decided to create a schism and recite the training rules (pƒÅtimokkha) apart from the Buddha and his followers, with 500 newly ordained monks. The Buddha sent his two Chief Disciples SƒÅriputta and MoggallƒÅna to bring back the erring young monks. Devadatta thought they had come to join his Sangha and, asking SƒÅriputta to give a talk, fell asleep. Then the Chief Disciples persuaded the young monks to return to the Buddha.Horner, I.B. (1963). The book of discipline Vol. V (Cullavagga), London Luzac, pp. 279‚Äì281 The Buddha did not show any hatred or deceive, even after what Devadatta had done. Soon after, Devadatta got sick and realized that what he had done was wrong. He tried to go to Buddha's place to apologize for what he did, but it was too late. On the way to the Buddha, the earth sucked him into the Niraya Hell for his deeds. =TheravƒÅda account= According to the PƒÅli Canon, he taught his sangha to adopt five tapas (literally, austerities) throughout their lives: #that monks should dwell all their lives in the forest, #that they should accept no invitations to meals, but live entirely on alms obtained by begging, #that they should wear only robes made of discarded rags and accept no robes from the laity, #that they should dwell at the foot of a tree and not under a roof, #that they should abstain completely from fish and flesh. The Buddha's reply was that those who felt so inclined could follow these rules ‚Äì except that of sleeping under a tree during the rainy season ‚Äì but he refused to make the rules obligatory. They are among the 13 ascetic practices (dhutanga). His followers (including bhikkhus and bhikkhunis) were new monks from the Vajjƒ´ clan.Vinaya Cullavagga (PTS pg. 198 ff.)  MahƒÅyƒÅna portrayals of Devadatta  =Lotus S≈´tra= According to Jacqueline Stone and Stephen F.

Early life Nathaniel Mayer Rothschild was the eldest son of Austrian Baron Lionel de Rothschild (1808‚Äì1879) and Baroness Charlotte von Rothschild (n√©e von Rothschild). His paternal grandparents were Freiherr (or Baron) Nathan Mayer Rothschild, after whom he was named, and Hannah (n√©e Barent-Cohen) Rothschild, the daughter of Levy Barent Cohen. His maternal grandparents were Freiherr Carl Mayer von Rothschild (1788‚Äì1855) and Adelheid Herz (1800‚Äì1853). Through both of his grandfathers, who were brothers, he was the great-grandson of Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744‚Äì1812), founder of the dynasty. In his youth, Rothschild was a Captain in the Buckinghamshire Yeomanry. Rothschild was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a friend of the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), but left without taking a degree. Career Rothschild worked as a partner in the London branch of the family bank, N M Rothschild & Sons, and became head of the bank after his father's death in 1879. During his tenure, he also maintained its pre-eminent position in private venture finance and in issuing loans to the governments of the US, Russia and Austria. Following the Rothschilds' funding of the Suez Canal, a close relationship was maintained with Benjamin Disraeli and affairs in Egypt. Rothschild also funded Cecil Rhodes in the development of the British South Africa Company and the De Beers diamond conglomerate. He later administered Rhodes' estate after Rhodes' death in 1902 and helped to set up the Rhodes Scholarship scheme at the University of Oxford. He was a prominent member of the Round Table movement, created in 1909. A noted philanthropist, Rothschild was heavily involved with the foundation of the Four Per Cent Industrial Dwellings Company, a model dwellings company whose aim was to provide decent housing, predominantly for the Jews of Spitalfields and Whitechapel. He also served as a trustee of the London Mosque Fund until his death.East London Mosque & London Muslim Centre. History display at their premises at 46‚Äì92 Whitechapel Road, London as seen on 28 April 2011. From 1889 until his death, he was Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire and was well known as an agriculturist. In the 1902 Coronation Honours list, he was appointed a Privy Counsellor and was sworn a member of the council at Buckingham Palace on 11 August 1902. On the same day, he was appointed to the Royal Victorian Order as a Knight Grand Cross (GCVO). =House of Commons= From 1865 to 1885, Nathan Rothschild sat in the House of Commons as Liberal Member of Parliament for Aylesbury. His father Lionel had previously been elected for the City of London from 1847 but had been unable to take the obligatory oath until 1858; they were MPs together from 1865 to 1868 and from 1869 to 1874. =Baron Rothschild= In 1847, his uncle Anthony Nathan de Rothschild (1810‚Äì1876) was created 1st Baronet de Rothschild, of Tring Park. Since Sir Anthony had no male heirs, the baronetcy passed on his death by special remainder to his nephew Nathan. In 1885, Rothschild became a member of the House of Lords when he was created Baron Rothschild, of Tring in the County of Hertford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He also was Baron de Rothschild (Freiherr von Rothschild) in the Austrian Empire, a noble title he had inherited via his father. In 1838, Queen Victoria had authorized the use of this Austrian title in the United Kingdom. When he was raised to the peerage by Gladstone, Rothschild was the first Jewish member of the House of Lords not to have previously converted to Christianity. (Disraeli had been created Earl of Beaconsfield in 1876, but was baptised into Anglicanism at age twelve). In common with the rest of his family, Rothschild joined the breakaway Liberal Unionist Party, formed in 1886 by Joseph Chamberlain, which ultimately merged into the Conservative Party. In 1909, he was famously derided by then Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, over his opposition to the People's Budget, when the latter said, at a meeting at the Holborn Restaurant on 24June that year: \\"I really think we are having too much Lord Rothschild. Are we to have all ways of reform, financial and social, blocked, simply by a notice-board; 'No Thoroughfare. By Order of Nathaniel Rothschild'?\\" Rothschild recommended the Lords reject the Parliament Bill, which was, however, passed. In 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, Rothschild was consulted for economic advice by Lloyd George. At his first invitation to confer at the Treasury, when asked what could be done to raise more money for the war effort, Rothschild reportedly answered: \\"Tax the rich, and tax them heavily.\\" Personal life On 16 April 1867, he married Emma Louise von Rothschild (1844‚Äì1935), a cousin from the Rothschild banking family of Germany in Frankfurt. They had three children: * Lionel Walter Rothschild (1868‚Äì1937), who never married but had two mistresses, one of whom bore him a daughter.Hannah Rothschild, \\"The Butterfly Effect\\", , pages 18-21. * Evelina Rothschild-Behrens (1873‚Äì1947) * Nathaniel Charles Rothschild (1877‚Äì1923), who married R√≥zsika Edle von Wertheimstein (1870‚Äì1940) He died in London, five days after an operation, on 31 March 1915 and was buried at Willesden Jewish Cemetery.

In case of varieties defined over the reals, this notion generalizes the notion of local non-flatness. A point of an algebraic variety which is not singular is said to be regular. An algebraic variety which has no singular point is said to be non-singular or smooth. The plane algebraic curve (a cubic curve) of equation crosses itself at the origin (0,0). The origin is a double point of this curve. It is singular because a single tangent may not be correctly defined there.  Definition  A plane curve defined by an implicit equation :, where is a smooth function is said to be singular at a point if the Taylor series of has order at least 2 at this point. The reason for this is that, in differential calculus, the tangent at the point of such a curve is defined by the equation :(x-x_0)F'_x(x_0,y_0) + (y-y_0)F'_y(x_0,y_0)=0, whose left-hand side is the term of degree one of the Taylor expansion. Thus, if this term is zero, the tangent may not be defined in the standard way, either because it does not exist or a special definition must be provided. In general for a hypersurface : the singular points are those at which all the partial derivatives simultaneously vanish. A general algebraic variety being defined as the common zeros of several polynomials, the condition on a point of to be singular point is that the Jacobian matrix of the first order partial derivatives of the polynomials has a rank at that is lower than the rank at other points of the variety. Points of V that are not singular are called non-singular or regular. It is always true that almost all points are non-singular, in the sense that the non-singular points form a set that is both open and dense in the variety (for the Zariski topology, as well as for the usual topology, in the case of varieties defined over the complexes). In case of a real variety (that is the set of the points with real coordinates of a variety defined by polynomials with real coefficients), the variety is a manifold near every regular point. But it is important to note that a real variety may be a manifold and have singular points. For example the equation y^3 + 2 x^2 y - x^4 = 0 defines a real analytic manifold but has a singular point at the origin.Milnor, pp. 12‚Äì13 This may be explained by saying that the curve has two complex conjugate branches that cut the real branch at the origin. Singular points of smooth mappings As the notion of singular points is a purely local property, the above definition can be extended to cover the wider class of smooth mappings, (functions from M to Rn where all derivatives exist). Analysis of these singular points can be reduced to the algebraic variety case by considering the jets of the mapping. The k-th jet is the Taylor series of the mapping truncated at degree k and deleting the constant term. Nodes In classical algebraic geometry, certain special singular points were also called nodes. A node is a singular point where the Hessian matrix is non-singular; this implies that the singular point has multiplicity two and the tangent cone is not singular outside its vertex.

Hildebrand is the modern German form of the name: in Old High German it is Hiltibrant and in Old Norse Hildibrandr. The word hild means \\"battle\\" and brand means \\"sword\\". The name itself is very likely of Lombardic origin.Frederick Norman, \\"Hildebrand and Hadubrand\\", in Three Essays on the 'Hildebrandslied' , London 1973, p. 47. He is associated with the cycle of legends about Theodoric the Great, called Dietrich in German, to whom he is a companion. Hildebrand appears in many works, most prominently in the Old High German Hildebrandslied, the Middle High German Nibelungenlied, in the Old Norse song \\"Hildebrand's Death\\" in √Åsmundar saga kappabana (called Hildibrandr), and in the late medieval J√ºngeres Hildebrandslied. He also appears as Hildiger in Gesta Danorum. In the Nibelungenlied, he is the armourer, brother-in-arms, and fatherly friend of Dietrich von Bern. Hildebrand kills Kriemhild, after she orders her brother's death and then kills Hagen herself. Hildebrand plays a supporting role to Dietrich in the numerous poems of the Dietrich cycle; in poems such as Virginal and Sigenot, Hildebrand tutors the young Dietrich and saves him from various scrapes. In the Hildebrandslied, which is older, Hildebrand fights his own son Hadubrand. Hildebrand had gone into exile with Dietrich. 30 years later, Hildebrand returns and encounters his son Hadubrand, who is leading his army against Hildebrand. The two leaders meet between the armies. They converse before fighting, and Hadubrand says that he is \\"Hadubrand Hildebrand's son\\", but he was told that Hildebrand died, and he accuses Hildebrand of being an old Hun and refuses to believe that he is his father. The poem ends before a conclusion is reached, but in \\"Hildebrand's Death\\" it is related that he killed his son. The Old Norse Thidrekssaga and the J√ºngeres Hildebrandslied both contain versions in which Hilderband defeats his son (here named Alebrand) but does not kill him. The Scandinavian song \\"Hildebrand's death\\" tells how Hildebrand fights against his half-brother. He is wounded fatally by him and the shield with the picture of his son falls near to his head on the ground. He begs his half-brother to cover his body, and to bury him properly. Although associated with historical characters from the 5th and 6th centuries, Theodoric and Odoacer, Hildebrand himself has not been identified as a historical personage.J.

Klingberg, was an Israeli scientist and the highest ranking Soviet spy ever caught in Israel. The case of Klingberg is regarded as one of the most destructive spy scandals in the history of the State of Israel. Biography =Early life= Klingberg was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1918, to a Hasidic Jewish family of rabbinical lineage. In his youth, he lived for a time with his grandfather, Rabbi Moshe Chaim Klingberg. His parents sent him to a cheder, or religious primary school. As a teenager, he turned his back on religious life and enrolled in a mainstream high school. In 1935, Klingberg began studying medicine at the University of Warsaw. In 1939, when World War II started with the German invasion of Poland, Klingberg escaped to the Soviet Union. There, he completed his medical studies in Minsk. =World War II= On 22 June 1941, the first day of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he volunteered for the Red Army, and served as a medical officer on the front lines until October 1941, when he was wounded in the leg by shrapnel. He recovered, and was then assigned to Perm in the Urals as an epidemiologist. In 1943, he attended the postgraduate course in epidemiology in Moscow at the Central Institute for Advanced Medical Training and finished it with distinction. That same year, he was part of a team that stopped an epidemic in the Urals. He also made a contribution into research toward typhoid fever. Toward the end of December 1943, the first parts of Byelorussia were retaken by the Red Army and Klingberg became Chief Epidemiologist of the Byelorussian Republic. At the end of the war, Klingberg was discharged from the Red Army with the rank of captain, and returned to Poland. There he found out that his parents and his only brother died on 19 August 1942 in the Treblinka extermination camp. In Warsaw he served as Acting Chief Epidemiologist at the Polish Ministry of Health. While living in post-war Poland, Klingberg met Adjia Eisman, who went by the name Wanda Yashinskaya. A microbiologist by profession, she was a survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto. She had escaped and managed to survive the war due to her Aryan appearance. They married, and in 1946, they decided to emigrate to the West. They moved to Sweden shortly afterward, where their daughter Sylvia was born in 1947. It is believed that Klingberg first came into contact with Soviet intelligence while living in Sweden.Marcus Klingberg - Biography on Ynetnews'The best keeper of secrets in the world' =Life in Israel= In November 1948, Klingberg immigrated to the newly formed state of Israel, which was in the closing stages of its War of Independence, with his wife and daughter. Within the Israeli intelligence community, and especially among those with close knowledge of the case, it is believed that the MGB told him to emigrate to Israel so he could spy for them, but he strongly denied this in an interview. Although Klingberg said that he was not a Zionist, he claimed that he moved to Israel because he was a Jew and because the Soviet Union supported Israel at that time. He was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces, and served in the Medical Corps. In March 1950, he advanced to the rank of Lt. Colonel (Sgan Aluf). He served as Head of the Department of Preventive Medicine and afterward he founded and chaired the Central Research Laboratories for Military Medicine. In 1957, he joined the top-secret Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) in Ness Ziona (south of Tel Aviv), where he served as Deputy Scientific Director (until 1972). He also served as Head of the Department of Epidemiology until 1978. In 1969, Klingberg joined the Sackler Faculty of Medicine of Tel Aviv University, and was Professor of Epidemiology and Head of the Department of Preventive and Social Medicine from 1978 to 1983. Klingberg's academic career and research papers earned him an international reputation in his field, and he was invited to take part in conferences by the World Health Organization. He was President of the European Teratology Society (1980‚Äì1982); and a co-founder and Chairman (1979‚Äì1981) of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Monitoring Systems (ICBDMS). He also served as President of the International Steering Committee for the Seveso Accident (Italy) from 1976 to 1984. In 1981, he co- founded the International Federation of Teratology Societies and in 1982 at the congress of the International Epidemiological Association that was held in Edinburgh, Scotland, he was elected to its Council. Klingberg spent his sabbaticals at the Henry Phipps Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States, from 1962 to 1964; at the National Institute for Public Health, Oslo, Norway (1972); at the Department of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK (1973); at the Department of Social and Community Medicine, University of Oxford and became a Visiting Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford (1978). At the time of his arrest, Klingberg served as Series Editor: Contributions to Epidemiology and Biostatistics. S. KARGER ‚Äì Basel-Paris-London-New York, and as Co-Chief Editor: Public Health Reviews (an International Quarterly. International Scientific Publications, Tel Aviv, Israel). Klingberg's daughter, Sylvia, became a left-wing activist in Israel and member of the socialist anti-Zionist movement Matzpen. In 1975, she married Ehud Adiv, an Israeli political activist serving a prison sentence on charges of spying for Syria, in a ceremony held in Ayalon Prison. They divorced after three years. Sylvia Klingberg later emigrated to France, where she became a Communist activist and married French philosophy professor Alain Brossat. Their son, Ian Brossat, is since 2008 a member of the Paris City Council for the French Communist Party. Sylvia died in October, 2019. =Espionage and capture= Klingberg renewed his contacts with Soviet intelligence and began spying in the 1950s. According to his indictment, which was based on his confession, he began spying in 1957. From then to 1976, Klingberg passed information about the activities in Israel's chemical and biological fields. Israel's foreign and domestic intelligence agencies, Mossad and Shin Bet, began to suspect Klingberg of espionage in the 1960s, but shadowing brought no results. While at the Institute for Biological Research, he was twice summoned by the authorities due to suspicions of him being a foreign agent. Klingberg refuted these claims, and in 1965 he passed a polygraph test, reportedly due to the fact that his interrogators simply asked the wrong questions, as they suspected he was spying for Polish rather than Soviet intelligence. In the 1950s, Klingberg was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in recognition of his service to the Soviet Union. In 1982, a Soviet Jew who immigrated to Israel after being granted an exit visa approached the Israeli security services and told them that the KGB had recruited him as a spy. Shin Bet subsequently ran him as a double agent, and through him, obtained strong circumstantial evidence that Klingberg was a Soviet spy. Despite this, the Shin Bet had not obtained solid evidence that would be admissible in court, and decided to elicit a confession out of him. In January 1983, Shin Bet officers informed Klingberg they wanted to send him to Singapore where a chemical plant allegedly blew up. After leaving home with his suitcase, he was taken not to the airport but to an apartment in some undisclosed location where he was interrogated harshly and put under psychological pressure to confess. After ten days, Klingberg admitted to being a Soviet mole and signed a confession. He claimed that he had provided information to the Soviet Union only for ideological reasons. Klingberg was tried in secret and sentenced to 20 years in prison. For the first 10 years of his 20-year sentence he was held in solitary confinement, in a high security prison, under a false name and a fabricated profession. After he was removed from solitary confinement, his cellmate was Shimon Levinson, another Israeli who spied for the Soviet Union. In September 1990, Klingberg's wife Wanda died. In accordance with her wishes, she was cremated. Her ashes were buried in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Klingberg's motives for spying are not definitively known. Klingberg claimed that he spied out of ideological reasons, and that he was never paid. However, he told his interrogators that he had not completed his medical studies and lacked a diploma, and that the KGB had blackmailed him by threatening to expose this. In an interview after his release, Klingberg maintained that he had spied out of ideological reasons, but had lied to his interrogators and said he had been blackmailed so he would receive a lighter sentence.Melman, Yossi: I Spy (Haaretz article) In an interview in 2014 he said that he also felt he owed the Russians a debt for saving the world from the Nazis. He said he had always been a communist, and had recruited his wife Wanda and two friends.Marcus Klingberg: the spy who knew too much, theguardian.com, 27 April 2014. In 1988-89, Israeli attorney Amnon Zichroni, representing the State of Israel, worked out a deal in which Klingberg would be released, and the Soviet Union would release Ron Arad, an Israeli fighter pilot believed to be captured in Lebanon. The deal fell apart. In 1997, Amnesty International appealed to the Israeli government to release Klingberg on medical grounds. Because of his failing health (he had several strokes), he was released to house arrest in October 1998. At his expense, a camera was installed in his apartment, which was hooked up to the offices of MALMAB (Ministry of Defense Security Authority) at the Kirya, Tel Aviv. His telephone was wiretapped, with his knowledge. Special guards who were working for the MALMAB were assigned to him, and Klingberg had to pay their salaries. Klingberg also signed a commitment not to speak about his work. In order to pay the guards and for the camera in his home, Klingberg took loans, and eventually had to sell his apartment to repay them. =Release and later life= On 18 January 2003 he was released from house arrest. He immediately left for Paris to live with his daughter Sylvia and grandson Ian. Klingberg lived in a one-room apartment in Paris, but did not take French citizenship. He frequently lectured on medicine at universities. He helped establish the Ludwik Fleck Center of the Collegium Helveticum - a university center in Z√ºrich, and delivered the opening lecture. As a former Lieutenant Colonel in the IDF, he received an officer's pension from the Israeli government, which in France amounted to around ‚Ç¨ 2,000 a month. Klingberg continued to have medical problems after his release, and was frequently hospitalized. He continued to take an interest in events in Israel, and read Hebrew newspapers.

In 2000, Bartlett married Allyson Elizabeth Sikes (born 1975). The couple has four sons and has resided since 2013 in Rogers, Arkansas. Career Bartlett, Brett Kavanaugh, Condoleezza Rice, and Mike Gerson review President George W. Bush's State of the Union speech in 2004 Bartlett worked on George W. Bush's first campaign for governor in 1994, when Bush unseated Ann W. Richards. He was appointed as deputy to the Policy Director in the Governor's office and was Issues Director for Bush's 1998 gubernatorial re-election campaign. During the 2000 presidential campaign, Bartlett was the Director of Rapid Response for Bush for President; he later worked as a deputy to presidential advisor Karen Hughes before being named White House Communications Director. On January 5, 2005, the White House announced that Bartlett would assume the role of Counselor to the President, which allows him to focus more broadly on strategic communication and the formulation of policy. He has also worked for Karl Rove's political consulting firm. On June 1, 2007, Bartlett announced his resignation as Counsel to the President. On October 28, 2007, Public Strategies, Inc., a business advisory firm, announced they had hired Bartlett as a senior strategist. In January 2009, Bartlett was named an adjunct faculty member at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, at which he taught a seminar on media and politics. In March 2009, Bartlett was named president and CEO of Public Strategies. In May 2013, Walmart announced that Bartlett would become the company's new executive vice president of Corporate Affairs in late June. Controversies Following the July 6, 2003, editorial by former ambassador Joseph Wilson, Bartlett (with Ari Fleischer) pushed reporters to pursue who in the CIA sent him to Niger, but stopped short of revealing that his wife worked for the agency. At the end of 2007 during an interview with Evan Smith published in the January 2008 Texas Monthly, Bartlett implied some conservative bloggers, such as Hugh Hewitt, were unfiltered mouthpieces for the GOP and the Bush White House. > I mean, talk about a direct IV into the vein of your support. It's a very > efficient way to communicate. They regurgitate exactly and put up on their > blogs what you said to them.

In May 2008, Bartlett appeared on various media outlets casting aspersions on the contentions raised by Scott McClellan in his book What Happened that the administration had repeatedly \\"shaded the truth\\" in connection with justifying the Iraq War, and describing the role that various administration officials played in the Valerie Plame leak case. In a May 2008 telephone interview with CNN, Bartlett \\"asserted that McClellan did not play a major role in key events, noting that the former aide was serving as deputy press secretary for domestic issues during the run-up to the war in Iraq, raising questions about how McClellan could claim the President used 'propaganda' to sell the war.\\" Footnotes External links *White House biography *Public Strategies Inc * |- 1971 births Counselors to the President Living people Texas Republicans Arkansas Republicans University of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts alumni University of Texas at Austin faculty White House Communications Directors Businesspeople from Arkansas People from Rockwall, Texas People from Rogers, Arkansas ","title":"Dan Bartlett"},{"id":"981974","title":"James Reese Europe"},{"id":"981980","text":"A fay is a fairy.

It is a common role in systems engineering and software engineering. The first use of the term requirements engineering was probably in 1964 in the conference paper \\"Maintenance, Maintainability, and System Requirements Engineering\\", but it did not come into general use until the late 1990s with the publication of an IEEE Computer Society tutorial in March 1997 and the establishment of a conference series on requirements engineering that has evolved into the International Requirements Engineering Conference. In the waterfall model, requirements engineering is presented as the first phase of the development process. Later development methods, including the Rational Unified Process (RUP) for software, assume that requirements engineering continues through the lifetime of a system. Requirement management, which is a sub-function of Systems Engineering practices, is also indexed in the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) manuals.  Activities  The activities involved in requirements engineering vary widely, depending on the type of system being developed and the specific practices of the organization(s) involved. These may include: #Requirements inception or requirements elicitation ‚Äì Developers and stakeholders meet, the latter are inquired concerning their needs and wants regarding the software product. #Requirements analysis and negotiation ‚Äì Requirements are identified (including new ones if the development is iterative) and conflicts with stakeholders are solved. Both written and graphical tools (the latter commonly used in the design phase but some find them helpful at this stage, too) are successfully used as aids. Examples of written analysis tools: use cases and user stories. Examples of graphical tools: UML and LML. #System modeling ‚Äì Some engineering fields (or specific situations) require the product to be completely designed and modeled before its construction or fabrication starts and, therefore, the design phase must be performed in advance. For instance, blueprints for a building must be elaborated before any contract can be approved and signed. Many fields might derive models of the system with the Lifecycle Modeling Language, whereas others, might use UML. Note: In many fields, such as software engineering, most modeling activities are classified as design activities and not as requirement engineering activities. #Requirements specification ‚Äì Requirements are documented in a formal artifact called a Requirements Specification (RS), which will become official only after validation. A RS can contain both written and graphical (models) information if necessary. Example: Software requirements specification (SRS). #Requirements validation ‚Äì Checking that the documented requirements and models are consistent and meet the needs of the stakeholder. Only if the final draft passes the validation process, the RS becomes official. #Requirements management ‚Äì Managing all the activities related to the requirements since inception, supervising as the system is developed and, even until after it is put into use (e. g., changes, extensions, etc.) These are sometimes presented as chronological stages although, in practice, there is considerable interleaving of these activities. Requirements engineering has been shown to clearly contribute to software project successes. Problems One limited study in Germany presented possible problems in implementing requirements engineering and asked respondents whether they agreed that they were actual problems. The results were not presented as being generalizable but suggested that the principal perceived problems were incomplete requirements, moving targets, and time boxing, with lesser problems being communications flaws, lack of traceability, terminological problems, and unclear responsibilities. Criticism Problem structuring, a key aspect of requirements engineering, has been speculated to reduce design performance. Some research suggests that it is possible if there are deficiencies in the requirements engineering process resulting in a situation where requirements do not exist, software requirements may be created regardless as an illusion misrepresenting design decisions as requirements See also *Requirements analysis, requirements engineering focused in software engineering. *Requirements Engineering Specialist Group (RESG) *International Requirements Engineering Board (IREB) *International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) *IEEE 12207 \\"Systems and software engineering ‚Äì Software life cycle processes\\" *TOGAF (Chapter 17) *Concept of operations (ConOps) *Operations management *Software requirements *Software requirements specification *Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) *Design specification *Specification (technical standard) *Formal specification *Software Quality *Quality Management *Scope Management References  External links * (\\"This standard replaces IEEE 830-1998, IEEE 1233-1998, IEEE 1362-1998 - http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/29148-2011.html\\") * Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge * Requirements Engineering Management Handbook by FAA *International Requirements Engineering Board (IREB) *IBM Rational Resource Library by IEEE Spectrum Systems engineering Software requirements IEEE standards ISO/IEC standards ","title":"Requirements engineering"},{"id":"981983","text":"In finance and economics, divestment or divestiture is the reduction of some kind of asset for financial, ethical, or political objectives or sale of an existing business by a firm. A divestment is the opposite of an investment.  Motives  Firms may have several motives for divestitures: # a firm may divest (sell) businesses that are not part of its core operations so that it can focus on what it does best. For example, Eastman Kodak, Ford Motor Company, Future Group and many other firms have sold various businesses that were not closely related to their core businesses. # to obtain funds. Divestitures generate funds for the firm because it is selling one of its businesses in exchange for cash. For example, CSX Corporation made divestitures to focus on its core railroad business and also to obtain funds so that it could pay off some of its existing debt. # a firm's \\"break-up\\" value is sometimes believed to be greater than the value of the firm as a whole. In other words, the sum of a firm's individual asset liquidation values exceeds the market value of the firm's combined assets. This encourages firms to sell off what would be worth more when liquidated than when retained. # divesting a part of a firm may enhance stability. Philips, for example, divested its chip division - NXP - because the chip market was so volatile and unpredictable that NXP was responsible for the majority of Philips's stock fluctuations while it represented only a very small part of Philips NV. # divesting a part of a company may eliminate a division which is under- performing or even failing. # regulatory authorities may demand divestiture, for example in order to create competition. # pressure from shareholders for social reasons (sometimes also called disinvestment). Examples include disinvestment from South Africa in the former era of apartheid (now ended), and more recent calls for fossil fuel divestment in response to climate change. = Divestment for financial goals = Often the term is used as a means to grow financially in which a company sells off a business unit in order to focus their resources on a market it judges to be more profitable, or promising. Sometimes, such an action can be a spin-off. In the United States, divestment of certain parts of a company can occur when required by the Federal Trade Commission before a merger with another firm is approved. A company can divest assets to wholly owned subsidiaries. It is a process of selling an asset. The largest corporate divestiture in history was the 1984 U.S. Department of Justice-mandated breakup of the Bell System into AT&T; and the seven Baby Bells. Of the 1000 largest global companies, those that are actively involved in both acquiring and divesting create as much as 1.5 to 4.7 percentage points higher shareholder returns than those primarily focused on acquisitions. = Divestment for social goals = Examples of divestment for social goals include: * Disinvestment from Israel, a movement by critics of Israel (since 1920s) * Disinvestment from South Africa in the former era of apartheid (1960s-1990s) * Tobacco industry divestment, coordinated by the NGO Tobacco-Free Portfolios (since 2000s) * Fossil fuel divestment in response to global warming, coordinated by the NGO 350.org (since 2010s) * Factory farming divestmentFactory farming divestment explained and big livestock divestment in response to environmental destruction, animal suffering, and human health concerns, coordinated by NGO Feedback Global.  Method of divestment  Some firms are using technology to facilitate the process of divesting some divisions. They post the information about any division that they wish to sell on their website so that it is available to any firm that may be interested in buying the division. For example, Alcoa has established an online showroom of the divisions that are for sale. By communicating the information online, Alcoa has reduced its hotel, travel, and meeting expenses. Firms use transitional service agreements to increase the strategic benefits of divestitures. Divestment execution includes five critical work streams: governance, tax, carve-out financial statements, deal-basis information, and operational separation. Companies often create cross-disciplined teams composed of IT, HR, legal, tax, and other key business units, to implement a business separation. With economic liberalization of the Indian economy, India's Ministry of Finance set up a separate Department of Disinvestments.

Ron lived on 'Alloway' from the age of 9. He and his brother initially attended the one-teacher Buramilong school on a nearby property and then attended Gilgandra school for his Intermediate Certificate 1930‚Äì1932. The optional Leaving Certificate was not provided at the Gilgandra school at that time, so when Ron reached that stage of his schooling he boarded in 1933‚Äì34 in Dubbo, 40 miles away, to complete his final two years of high school. At Dubbo High School a memorial trust in his name has been operating for many years.

Ron Middleton joined his father here, working as a jackaroo. He was working on that property at the time of his enlistment. He enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force on 14 October 1940, and trained as a pilot in the Empire Air Training Scheme. He undertook initial flying training at No. 5 Elementary Flying Training School (5 EFTS) Narromine, and advanced training in Canada. In February 1942 he joined No. 149 Squadron of the Royal Air Force, flying as second pilot on Short Stirling bombers. By July of that year he was appointed as an aircraft captain, and flew his first raid as a pilot-in-command against D√ºsseldorf.Bill, Stuart, Middleton VC, Melbourne 1991 Victoria Cross action On 28 November 1942, Middleton was captain of Stirling BF372Record for Stirling Mk.I BF372 OJ-H on lostaircraft.com detailed to bomb the Fiat aircraft works at Turin. It was his twenty-ninth combat sortie, one short of the thirty required for completion of a 'tour' and mandatory rotation off combat operations. Middleton and his crew arrived above Turin after a difficult flight over the Alps, due to the low combat ceiling of the \\"bombed- up\\" and \\"fueled-up\\" Stirling (due to its short stubby wings, designed to keep all up weight down, but of little use at high altitudes). Over the target area Middleton had to make three low-level passes in order to positively identify the target; on the third, the aircraft was hit by heavy anti-aircraft fire which wounded both pilots and the wireless operator. Middleton suffered numerous grievous wounds, including shrapnel wounds to the arms, legs and body, having his right eye torn from its socket and his jaw shattered. Middleton's grave in Beck Row, Suffolk. He passed out briefly, and his second pilot, Flight Sergeant L.A. Hyder, who was also seriously wounded, managed to regain control of the plunging plane at 800 feet and drop the bombs, before receiving first aid from the other crew. Middleton regained consciousness in time to help recover control of his stricken bomber. Middleton was in great pain, was barely able to see, was losing blood from wounds all over his body, and could breathe only with difficulty. He must have known that his own chances of survival were slim, but he nonetheless determined to fly his crippled aircraft home, and return his crew to safety. During the return flight he frequently said over the intercom \\"I'll make the English Coast. I'll get you home\\".Bill, Stuart, Middleton VC, Melbourne, 1991 After four hours of agony and having been further damaged by flak over France, Middleton reached the coast of England with five minutes of fuel reserves. At this point he turned the aircraft parallel to the coast and ordered his crew to bail out. Five of his crew did so and landed safely, but his front gunner and flight engineer remained with him to try to talk him into a forced landing on the coast, something he must have known would have risked extensive civilian casualties. He steered the aircraft out over the sea, off Dymchurch, and ordered the last two crew to bail out. They then too bailed out, but did not survive the night in the English Channel. Middleton stayed with the aircraft, which crashed into the Channel. His body was washed ashore on 1 February 1943. The last line of his Victoria Cross citation reads: \\"His devotion to duty in the face of overwhelming odds is unsurpassed in the annals of the Royal Air Force\\". Middleton was posthumously promoted to pilot officer, and is buried at Beck Row, [Mildenhall], Suffolk. His Victoria Cross and uniform are displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. Pilot Officers George Royde (navigator) and Norman Skinner (wireless operator) were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, while Flight Sergeant Leslie Hyder (2nd pilot), Flight Sergeant Douglas Cameron (mid-upper gunner) and Sergeant H.W. Gough (rear gunner) each received the Distinguished Flying Medal. Coincidentally, Cameron (as a flying officer) would be a member of Flight Sergeant Ian Willoughby Bazalgette's crew when the Canadian would be awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross in 1944. Legacy Middleton has been honoured by the naming of the \\"Middleton VC Club\\" at 1 RAAF Recruit Training Unit, RAAF Base Wagga. He was on one of 1995 Australia Remembers 45c stamps.

He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \\"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches. Following his death, Glicken was praised by associates for his love of volcanoes and commitment to his field.  Life and career  = Early work = alt= Man sitting on a folding chair next to a vehicle and trailer, writing in a notebook and smiling as he looks towards the camera Glicken was born in 1958 to Milton and Ida Glicken. He graduated from Stanford University in 1980. Later that year, while a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, he was temporarily hired by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to help monitor the volcano Mount St. Helens in Washington state. St. Helens, dormant since the 1840s and 1850s, resumed activity in March 1980. As seismic and volcanic activity increased, volcanologists working for the USGS in its Vancouver branch prepared to observe any impending eruption. Geologist Don Swanson and others placed reflectors on and around the growing lava domes,Parchman, p. 108‚Äì109. and, on May 1, 1980, established the Coldwater I and II observation posts to use laser ranging to measure how the distances to these reflectors changed over time as the domes deformed. Glicken monitored the volcano for two weeks, taking shelter in a trailer at the Coldwater II site located a little more than northwest of the volcano. On May 18, 1980, after working for six days straight, Glicken took the day off to attend an interview for his graduate work with his professor, Richard V. Fisher, in Mammoth, California.Fisher, p. 90‚Äì92. His research adviser and mentorThompson, p. 111. David A. Johnston replaced him at his post, despite expressing concerns about its safety given indications of mobile magma within the volcano. After a magnitude 5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope triggered that part of the volcano to slide at 8:32 a.m.,Harris, p. 205. Mount St. Helens erupted. Johnston was killed after he was enveloped by swift pyroclastic flows that traveled down the mountain's flanks at near supersonic speeds. After the eruption, Glicken went to Toutle High School, the center for relief efforts, where he joined Air Force Reserve Rescue Squadron officials in a helicopter to look for Johnston or any sign of his post. Despite searching with three separate crews over a span of nearly six hours, Glicken found no trace.Thompson, p. 112. He attempted to enlist a fourth helicopter crew to aid his search, but they declined, fearing dangerous conditions.Parchman, p. 46. In his distraught state, Glicken refused to accept Johnston's death, and had to be comforted by Swanson before calming down. In mid-1980, after the May eruption, USGS Survey scientists decided to establish the David A. Johnston Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) in Vancouver,Thompson, p. 141‚Äì42. intending to closely monitor volcanoes in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Glicken returned to St. Helens to analyze the remains of the volcano's lateral blast. However, as other CVO employees had already commenced their research at the mountain, Glicken's offer to help USGS on his own was declined by senior scientists.Thompson, p. 150‚Äì51. Instead, he found work with newly appointed Survey employee Barry Voight, a specialist in landslides. Under Voight's guidance, Glicken absorbed himself in his work,Thompson, p. 151. motivated to earn a job at the Survey, and to relieve some of his anguish over Johnston's death.Thompson, p. 151‚Äì152. Glicken and a team of geologists mapped the debris field left over from St. Helens's structural collapse, which consisted of roughly a quarter of the mass of the volcano. Through extensive, meticulous analysis, the team traced the origins and the means of movement of each piece of debris, ranging from blocks in width to mere fragments. With his group, Glicken compiled a landmark study in the field of volcanic landslides, establishing the principle that tall volcanoes have a tendency to collapse.Thompson, p. 152. The study garnered praise for its unique conclusions and attention to detail, inspiring volcanologists to identify similar deposit mounds at volcanoes around the world. After the findings from his dissertation were published in several shorter articles throughout the 1980s, Glicken earned recognition as the first geologist to explain the creation of hummock fields near tall volcanoes. = Research after St. Helens and death = In the years following the eruption, despite earning rapid fame and opportunities to research internationally in Japan, New Zealand, and Guadeloupe, Glicken still failed to obtain a job at USGS. Senior employees at the Survey found his behavioral oddities unsettling. Activity at Mount St. Helens diminished, prompting USGS to reduce CVO's budget and contemplate closing the station. He continued helping the Survey until 1989, also serving as an assistant researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara. From 1989 to 1991, Glicken continued his volcanological studies in Japan as a postdoctoral fellow at the Earthquake Research Institute of the University of Tokyo, supported by grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation. Later, while a research professor and translatorThompson, p. 154. at Tokyo Metropolitan University, Glicken became involved with research at Mount Unzen. The volcano had recently resumed eruptive activity in November 1990, after being dormant for 198 years. In the months after its first activity, it erupted sporadically, and the government evacuated its vicinity near the end of May 1991. On June 2, 1991, Glicken visited the mountain with Katia and Maurice Krafft. The three entered a danger zone near the base of the volcano the following day, assuming that any potentially hazardous pyroclastic flows would follow a turn in the landscape and safely bypass them. Later that day, a lava dome collapsed,Parchman, p. 359. sending a large flow down the valley at . The current reached the turnLopes, p. 44. before separating into two parts, and the upper, hotter part swiftly overcame the volcanologists' post, killing them upon impact.Fisher, p. 98. In total, 41 or 42 people died in the incident, including press members who had been watching the volcanologists.Lopes, p. 43. The volcano burned down 390 houses, and the remains of the flow extended in length. Glicken's remains were found four days later, and were cremated according to his parents' wishes. To date, Glicken and Johnston are the only American volcanologists known to have been killed by a volcanic eruption.Fisher, p. 99. = Posthumous report = At the time of his death, Glicken had been seeking to publish his doctoral dissertation in one piece, having earlier published elements as shorter articles. He had already defined the criteria for debris avalanches on the slopes of volcanoes, and authored several publications on the subject; Swanson named him one of the foremost experts in the field. After the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, research in the niche area grew as more studies identified debris at well- known volcanoes. His work on flows at Mount St. Helens is considered the most complete in the field to date. It was later published in 1996 as a single report by his acquaintances Carol Ostengren, John Costa, Dan Dzurisin, and Jon Major, among others, at the United States Geological Survey. In his preface to Glicken's publication, Major comments that \\"the Mount St. Helens deposit will never be mapped in such detail again.\\" Glicken's report is titled \\"Rockslide- debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\\". It comprises his extensive laboratory and field work, supplemented by photographs of the eruption, writings that describe St. Helens before the eruption, and references to previous publications, including Voight's work.Glicken, p. 1. In the report, Glicken constructed a map of the landslide deposit at a scale of 1:24000, followed by a lithologic map describing rock varieties at a scale of 1:12000. The report also provides a conclusion for the movement of each slide block, using photographs and other data to estimate the velocity of each landslide, describing the composition of each, and recounting the interactions between blocks.Glicken, p. 74‚Äì79.  Tributes and legacy  Despite their appreciation of his work, many of Glicken's associates considered him eccentric and highly disorganized. Chatty, noted for being extremely sensitive, Glicken also paid meticulous attention to detail. One of his friends writes, \\"Harry was a character his whole life. ... Everyone who knew him was amazed he was such a good scientist.\\" Regarding Glicken's driving habits, the same acquaintance describes him as \\"a cartoon character\\" who \\"would drive at full speed down the road, talking about whatever was important to him, and ... come to a four-way stoplight and he'd sail through it, never knowing he'd just gone through\\". Glicken's father said in 1991 that his son died pursuing his passion, and that he was \\"totally absorbed\\" with volcanology. United States Geological Survey co-worker Don Peterson adds that Glicken was keen in his enthusiastic approach to observation, and praises his accomplishments throughout his career and as a graduate student. Speaking about Glicken's personal passion for his field, his mentor and professor Richard V. Fisher writes, \\"What happened at St. Helens is something that troubled [Glicken] deeply for a very long time, and, in a way, I think it made him even more dedicated than he was before.\\" Associate Robin Holcomb remarks that \\"Harry was very enthusiastic, very bright, and very ambitious, ambitious to do something worthwhile on volcanoes.\\"Thompson, p. 153. Many studies have utilized Glicken's criteria for volcanic landslide recognition, and many subsequent papers on avalanches have acknowledged or referenced Glicken's 1996 report. Reflecting on Glicken's body of work, USGS employee Don Swanson names him as \\"a world leader in studies of volcanic debris avalanches\\". Glicken was closely connected to the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he earned his doctorate and conducted research. To remember his association with the university, each year the Department of Earth Science awards an outstanding graduate geology student the \\"Harry Glicken Memorial Graduate Fellowship\\", established by the Harry Glicken Fund, which aims to support students \\"who will pursue research relating to the understanding of volcanic processes\\".  Selected publications  Most of Glicken's published work centers around the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. He also coauthored works with other volcanologists that focused on debris avalanches. Colleague Jon Major writes that \\"The full scope of Harry's work ... has never been published.\\"   *  References  = Notes = = Sources =     External links  *Yoshiaki Ida and Barry Voight, Introduction to the Harry Glicken memorial special issue on \\"models of magmatic processes and volcanic eruptions\\", Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research Volume 66, Issues 1‚Äì4, Models of Magmatic Processes and Volcanic Eruptions, July 1995, Pages ix‚Äìxvi. 1958 births 1991 deaths American geologists United States Geological Survey personnel American volcanologists Deaths in volcanic eruptions Natural disaster deaths in Japan University of California, Santa Barbara alumni Stanford University alumni University of Tokyo alumni Tokyo Metropolitan University faculty Filmed deaths during natural disasters 20th-century geologists ","title":"Harry Glicken"},{"id":"982000","text":"In mathematics, specifically in the study of topology and open covers of a topological space X, a star refinement is a particular kind of refinement of an open cover of X.

The term originated by the authors Stork and Lyal (1993) and was originally used to explain the extinction of parasitic insects following the loss of their specific hosts. The term is now used to describe the loss of any interacting species, including competition with their counterpart, and specialist herbivores with their food source. Coextinction is especially common when a keystone species goes extinct. Causes The most frequently cited example is that of the extinct passenger pigeon and its parasitic bird lice Columbicola extinctus and Campanulotes defectus. Recently, C. extinctus was rediscovered on the band-tailed pigeon, and C. defectus was found to be a likely case of misidentification of the existing Campanulotes flavus. However, even though the passenger pigeon louse was rediscovered, coextinctions of other parasites, even on the passenger pigeon, may have occurred. Several louse species‚Äîsuch as Rallicola extinctus, a huia parasite‚Äîprobably became extinct together with their hosts. Recent studies have suggested that up to 50% of species may go extinct in the next 50 years. This is in part due to coextinction; for example the loss of tropical butterfly species from Singapore is attributed to the loss of their specific larval host plants. To see how possible future cases of coextinction would play out, researchers have made models to show probabilistic relationships between affiliate and host extinctions across co-evolved inter-specific systems. The subjects are pollinating Ficus Wasps and Ficus, primate parasites, (Pneumocystis Fungi, Nematode, and Lice) and their hosts, parasitic mites and lice and their avian hosts, butterflies and their larval host plants, and ant butterflies and their host ants. For all but the most host-specific affiliate groups (e.g., primate Pneumocystis fungi and primates), affiliate extinction levels may be modest at low levels of host extinction but can be expected to rise quickly as host extinctions increase to levels predicted in the near future. This curvilinear relationship between host and affiliate extinction levels may also explain, in part, why so few coextinction events have been documented to date. Investigations have been carried out into coextinction risk among the rich Psyllid fauna Hemiptera ‚Äì Psylloidea inhabiting acacias (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae: Acacia) in central eastern New South Wales, Australia. The results, suggest that A. ausfeldii hosts one specialist psyllid species, Acizzia, and that A. gordonii hosts one specialist psyllid, Acizzia. Both psyllid species may be threatened at the same level of their host species with coextinction. Interaction patterns can be used to anticipate the consequences of phylogenetic effects. By using a system of methodical observations, scientists can use the phylogenetic relationships of species to predict the number of interactions they exhibit in more than one-third of the networks, and the identity of the species with which they interact in about half of the networks. Consequentially, simulated extinction events tend to trigger coextinction cascades of related species. This results in a non-random pruning of the evolutionary tree. In a 2004 paper in Science, ecologist Lian Pin Koh and colleagues discuss coextinction, stating > \\"Species coextinction is a manifestation of the interconnectedness of > organisms in complex ecosystems. The loss of species through coextinction > represents the loss of irreplaceable evolutionary and coevolutionary > history. In view of the global extinction crisis, it is imperative that > coextinction be the focus of future research to understand the intricate > processes of species extinctions. While coextinction may not be the most > important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one.\\" > (Koh et al. 2004) Koh et al. also define coendangered as taxa \\"likely to go extinct if their currently endangered hosts [...] become extinct.\\" One example is the near extinction of the genus Hibiscadelphus as a consequence of the disappearance of several of the Hawaiian honeycreepers, its pollinators. There are several instances of predators and scavengers dying out following the disappearance of species which represented their source of food: for example, the coextinction of the Haast's eagle with the moa. Coextinction may also occur on a local level: for example, the decline in the red ant Myrmica sabuleti in southern England, caused by habitat loss, resulted in the local extinction of the large blue butterfly, which is dependent on the ant as a host for the larvae. In this case the ant avoided local extinction, and the butterfly has been reintroduced. Another example of species going through coextinction is the rhinoceros stomach bot fly (Gyrostigma rhinocerontis) and its host species the endangered black rhinoceros and white rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis and Ceratotherium simum). The fly's larvae mature in a rhinoceros's stomach lining, having entered the body via the digestive tract, and so are dependent on rhinoceros species to reproduce. Consequences Coextinction can mean loss of biodiversity and diversification. Coextinctions can influence not only parasite and mutualist diversification but also their hosts. Arguably, parasites facilitate host diversification through sexual selection. That loss of parasites can reduce host diversification rates. Coextinction can also result in loss of evolutionary history. The extinction of related hosts can lead to the extinction of related parasites. The loss of history is likely to be greater than the loss expected, were species to go extinct at random. Furthermore, if coextinctions are clustered, it is more likely that coextinction can produce non-random trait loss. Species that are at risk of coextinction are expected to be larger because rare hosts tend to be larger and larger hosts have larger parasites. They can also be expected to have lengthy generation times or higher tropic positions. Coextinction can extend beyond biodiversity and has direct and indirect consequences from the communities of lost species. One main consequence of coextinction that goes beyond biodiversity is mutualism, by loss of food production with a decline in threatened pollinators. Losses of parasites can have negative impacts on humans or the species. In rare hosts, losses of specialist parasites can predispose hosts to infection by emergent parasites. Furthermore, relating to the consequences of removing specialist parasites from rare hosts, is the problem of where the parasites will go once their host is extinct. If the parasites are dependent on only those species than there are parasite species that are at risk of extinction through co-endangerment. On the other hand, if they are able to find and switch onto alternative hosts, those hosts can turn out to be humans. Either way, the loss of parasites by co extinction or the acquiring of new parasites by alternative hosts, proves to be a major issue. Coextinction can go beyond the decreased biodiversity, it can range into various biomes and link various ecosystems. A study conducted in New Caledonia has shown that extinction of a coral reef-associated fish species of average size would eventually result in the co-extinction of at least ten species of parasites.  Risks  The host Specificity and Life Cycle is a major factor in the risk of coextinction. Species of mutalists, parasites, and many free- living insects that have staged life cycles are more likely to be a victim of coextinction. This is due to the fact that these organisms may depend on multiple hosts throughout their lives in comparison to simple life cycled organisms. Also, if organisms are evolutionary flexible, then these organisms may escape extinction.Bronstein JL, Dieckmann U, Ferri√®rre R. 2004. Coevolutionary dynamics and the conservation of mutualisms.

The area with that has the greatest effect of coextinction is the tropics. There is a continued disappearance in the habitat, human intervention, and a great loss in vital ecosystem services. This is threatening because the tropics contain 2/3 of the all known species but they aren't in a situation where they can be fully taken care of. Along with forest loss other risk factors include: coastal development, overexploitation of wildlife, and habitat conversion, that also affect human well-being. In an effort to find a stop to coextinction, researchers have found that the first step would be to conserve the host species in which other species are dependent on. These hosts serve as major components for their habitat and need them to survive. In deciding what host to protect, it is important to choose one that can benefit an array of other dependent species.

It was founded in 1922 by Paul Sharp. It changed its name to Bond Cars Ltd in 1963. The company was taken over by the Reliant Motor Co Ltd of Tamworth, Staffordshire in February 1969, who eventually closed the Preston factory in August 1970, transferring the spare parts business for the Bond Minicar, 875 saloon, 875 Ranger van and Equipe models to a firm called Bob Joyner & Son in Oldbury in the English Midlands. Reliant nevertheless continued to use the Bond name until 1974 on Bond Bug models made at their own Tamworth plant. Bond Minicar 1949‚Äì1966 1959 Bond Minicar Mark F Family Saloon Sharp's Commercials began production of an economical three-wheeled car early in 1949. It was called the \\"Bond Minicar\\" (retrospectively to be called the Mark A) and was powered by a single-cylinder two-stroke Villiers engine of 122 or 197 cc. Bodywork was mostly aluminium, though some later models used fibreglass for parts of the car. It proved very popular at the time owing to post-war economies. The engine bay of a 1959 Bond Minicar. (Note the unmodified kick- starter on the right of the Villiers unit.) The Minicar moved on through several different incarnations, culminating in the \\"Mark G\\" in 1961. Convertibles were offered, as were van and estate versions. The engine was upgraded, first to a single-cylinder 250 cc and then to a 250 cc twin-cylinder Villiers 4T (optional on the Mark G). The engines were essentially a Villiers motorcycle-type unit and therefore had no reverse gear. However, this was a minimal inconvenience, because the engine, gearbox and front wheel were mounted as a single unit and could be turned by the steering wheel up to 90 degrees either side of the straight-ahead position, enabling the car to turn within its own length. Reverse gear of a sort was offered on later models, but using this involved stopping the engine and starting it backwards. This was achieved by reversing the Siba Dynastart unit, a device which doubled as both starter and generator. It operated as a starter motor when the starter button was pressed but when the engine was running it generated power instead and recharged the battery. The last Bond Minicar, a Mark G, was made in November 1966. Bond Equipe 1963‚Äì1970 Bond Equipe 2 litre saloon Mk 2 The Equipe GT was Bond's first four-wheel car, a sports car, with fibreglass two door body. Essentially it was a Triumph Herald chassis, complete with bulkhead, windscreen and doors, with the Triumph Spitfire 1147 cc engine. The doors had slightly revised glass, to accommodate the fibreglass fastback roof and rear assembly. The Herald's forward hingeing bonnet was replaced with a revised version giving an excellent, clean sportscar-like appearance. This was replaced by the GT4S model in 1964, offering 4 seats, and an opening boot lid. In front, the beautiful Italianate bonnet styling was somewhat compromised by the addition of the quad headlights from the Triumph 2000, flanking a cut-down version of the original Herald grille. A bonnet scoop was also added. A 1296cc engine was introduced in 1967. During the life of this car, it was not uncommon to see Triumph Heralds modified by the fitting of a Bond Equipe bonnet, as all the side body lines matched perfectly. Less common were Bond Equipes, bizarrely fitted with Herald front ends. In August 1967, 19 months before the take-over by Reliant in February 1969, the new Equipe 2 Litre was introduced. Based partly on styling proposals by Trevor Fiore but mainly designed by Bond's own in-house designer, Alan Pounder, the doors had new skins and all external traces of the Triumph Herald were gone, with the exception of the windscreen surround and the bonnet catches. The Triumph 2000 headlamps were retained, but were now incorporated into a more stylish, full width grille. At the rear, the Lucas triple-bullet tail-lamps were replaced and this version of the car began to resemble the later Reliant Scimitar SS1, which would not in fact appear for another twenty years. This model had the six-cylinder 2-litre Triumph Vitesse chassis and engine, uprated to the Mk 2 version in 1968, at which time a convertible version was also offered.Lawrie Bond ‚Äì The Man & The Marque Nick Wotherspoon Bookmarque Publishing 1993 Bond 875 1965‚Äì1970 Bond 875 Mark 1 saloon The Bond 875 was a three-wheeler with a rear-mounted four-cylinder 875 cc four-stroke, Hillman Imp engine.

The school specialised in teaching non English language students. The school closed on the 30th of June 2020, making all its staff redundant. No reasons were provided by the school operator, Inspired Education. St Michael's is located in the same buildings as the former College of St. Michael and All Angels, a boys school founded by Frederick Ouseley in 1856 to provide a model for the performance of Anglican church music. Choral services were performed daily in term time. The college possessed a library that contained rare books of international importance. Financial difficulties forced its closure in 1985. History The school was founded in reaction to the decline of Anglican church music in the Victorian period. Ouseley sited it in a remote location so as to insulate it from the influence of London. Designed by renowned English Church architect Henry Woodyer, until its closure the school regularly sang 150 settings of evensong; it was the last educational establishment in England to sing the orders throughout the week. In the school chapel the choir is separated from the chancel by an ornate gilded screen topped by candles. The choir is backed by a 'Father' Willis organ, painted with a representation of St Michael defeating the dragon. After closure the school buildings were used as the set for the 1986 Halloween television movie, The Worst Witch based on the fantasy novel by Jill Murphy starring Fairuza Balk and Tim Curry. Recordings of the choir are listed in the British Library Sound Archive and are available on CD in back catalogue editions.National Sound Archive list Retrieved 27 July 2009 A recording of the final Evensong sung at the school in 1985 is found on the Archive of Recorded Church Music siteArchive of Recorded Church Music retrieved February 7, 2017 The school chapel is now the parish church for the surrounding village of St Michaels which was created to support the creation of the choir school in the mid-19th century. The chapel has a full Henry Willis & Sons organ which was installed into the new church created to support the then new St Michael's College in the mid-19th century.

The population of Wyszogr√≥d was 2,793 in 2004. History In the 11th century Wyszogr√≥d became fortified and started to act as a local centre of commerce. In the 12th century it became the seat of local castellany and soon it became one of the seats of the Dukes of Masovia. There is a settlement on the site of the ancient Ukrainian tribe Vyatichi. Here, Prince Danilo Romanovich was waiting for the Tatar aggression of 1241. By 1382 there existed an ancient Ukrainian church. Relocated on Magdeburg Law in 1398, Wyszogr√≥d became one of the most important inland ports and centres of textile production in the area. During The Deluge the town was pillaged and burnt by the Swedes. Several subsequent fires destroyed Wyszogr√≥d almost completely. After the Partitions of Poland in 1793 it was annexed by Prussia. In 1807 it was reconquered by the Duchy of Warsaw and after the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815 it was transferred to the Kingdom of Poland. At the end of 19th century Wyszogr√≥d again recovered. During World War II, the town was heavily damaged during the course of the German invasion of Poland in September, 1939. During the German occupation, Jews were brutalized in the town and conscripted for forced labor. Beginning in March 1941, they were deported to other ghettos and then on to Treblinka were they were murdered in October 1941 and to Auschwitz, where most were murdered in November 1942. During these deportations and the time spent in other ghettos, they suffered unimaginable horrors along with starvation and disease. These experiences of the Holocaust resulted in the deaths of all but 250 of Wyszogrod's 2700 Jews. There were several partisan groups operating both within the city and in the forests nearby. The town was rebuilt after the war, though its population did not recover to pre-war levels.

Popenoe in 1915 Paul Bowman Popenoe (October 16, 1888 ‚Äì June 19, 1979) was an American agricultural explorer and eugenicist. He was an influential advocate of the compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill and the mentally disabled, and the father of marriage counseling in the United States. Biography Born Paul Bowman Popenoe in Topeka, Kansas, in 1888, he was the son of Marion Bowman Popenoe and Frederick Oliver Popenoe, a pioneer of the avocado industry. (Popenoe dropped his middle name early in life.) He moved to California as a teen. After attending Occidental College for two years and Stanford University for his junior year majoring in English with coursework in biology, Popenoe left school to care for his father and worked for several years as a newspaper editor. He then worked briefly as an agricultural explorer collecting date specimens in Western Asia and Northern Africa for his father's nursery in California, along with his younger brother, Wilson Popenoe, a horticulturist. His travels received considerable support and interest from the US Department of Agriculture. Paul Popenoe published his first book, Date Growing in the Old World and the New, in 1913. In the mid-1910s, Popenoe became interested in human breeding and edited the Journal of Heredity from 1913 to 1917, with a special attention to eugenics and social hygiene. By 1918, Popenoe had become well-established enough to co-author (with Roswell Hill Johnson) a popular college textbook on eugenics (Applied Eugenics, edited by Richard T. Ely), which outlined his vision of a eugenics program that primarily relied on the segregation of \\"waste humanity\\" into rural institutions, where they would perform manual labor to offset the cost of their institutionalization. He was opposed to child labor on the belief that banning it would reduce the size of families that he regarded as unfit members of society.\\"...the unfit poor would be unable to put their children to work and thus would have fewer children, a eugenic goal.\\"Thomas C. Leonard, \\"Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era\\". Journal of Economic Perspectives, Volume 19, No. 4, Fall 2005, pp. 207‚Äì224 Additionally, Applied Eugenics contains a chapter expounding on Popenoe's belief in the racial inferiority of black people. During World War I, Popenoe was inducted into the officer corps of the US Army. Under the War Department Commission on Training Camp Activities, he was charged with rooting out liquor and prostitution in an effort to reduce the high incidence of venereal disease in US troops.David Popenoe, War Over the Family, Transaction Publishers, 2005. . Chapter 14: Remembering My Father: An Intellectual Portrait of \\"The Man Who Saved Marriages.\\" Popenoe married Betty Stankowitch in New York on 23 August 1920. They remained married until her death on 26 June 1978. In the mid-1920s, Popenoe began working with E.S. Gosney, a wealthy California financier, and the Human Betterment Foundation to promote eugenic policies in California. In 1909, California had enacted its first compulsory sterilization law to allow for the sterilization of the mentally ill and the mentally retarded in its state psychiatric hospitals. With Popenoe as his scientific workhorse, Gosney intended to study the sterilization work done in California and to use it to advocate sterilization in other parts of the country and in the world at large. That would culminate in a number of works, most prominently their joint-authored Sterilization for Human Betterment: A Summary of Results of 6,000 Operations in California, 1909-1929 in 1929. The work would become a popular text for the advocacy of sterilization, as it purported to be an objective study of the operations in the state and concluded, unsurprisingly, that rigorous programs for the sterilization of the \\"unfit\\" were beneficial to all involved, including the sterilized patients. In the 1930s, he served as a member of the American Eugenics Society's board of directors, along with Charles B. Davenport, Henry H. Goddard, Madison Grant, Harry H. Laughlin, and Gosney, among others. In 1929 he received an honorary Sc.D. degree from Occidental College, which he had attended. Thenceforth, he commonly referred to himself as \\"Dr. Popenoe\\". In 1976, Popenoe also received the Auld Lang Syne award from Occidental. Nevertheless, in 2019 after a unanimous vote of its board of trustees on April 26 of that year, Occidental rescinded the honorary Sc.D. degree. Leading up to that vote, Occidental Professor Peter Dreier wrote an opinion article in March 2019 about the college's historical role in eugenics and racism, and 86 percent of the college's faculty then signed a statement urging the board to revoke the degree granted to Popenoe 90 years earlier. Along with his advocacy of sterilization programs, Popenoe was also interested in using the principles of German and Austrian marriage consultation services for eugenic purposes. Aghast at the divorce rate in US society, Popenoe came to the conclusion that \\"unfit\\" families would reproduce out of wedlock, but \\"fit\\" families would need to be married to reproduce. With financial help from Gosney, he opened the American Institute of Family Relations in Los Angeles in 1930. It was described in 1960 as \\"the world's largest and best known marriage-counseling center,\\" with a staff of seventy. For a while, Popenoe's two major interests, eugenics and marriage counseling, ran in parallel, and he published extensively on both topics. As public interest in eugenics waned, Popenoe focused more of his energies into marriage counseling and during public rejection of eugenics at the end of World War II, with the revelation of the Nazi Holocaust, Popenoe had thoroughly redefined himself as primarily a marriage counselor, whichhad lost most of its explicit eugenic overtones Over time, he became more prominent in the field of counseling. Popenoe favored a popular,rather than academic, approach. In that vein, he appeared on the Art Linkletter television show for over a decade, and he regularly gave lectures and wrote mainstream articles for the general public. For many years, he had a nationally-syndicated newspaper column promoting marriage and family life. As presented in a 1960 biography, the focus areas of his counseling approach and the American Institute of Family Relations included couples' attitudes towards marriage, preparation (including sexuality education), moral values, a focus on action, and mutual understanding between the sexes. At the peak of his career, he co-founded and edited Ladies' Home Journal's most popular column of all time, \\"Can This Marriage Be Saved?\\" In 1960, he co-authored (with Dorothy Disney) the book of the same name. His introduction to the book catalogued some of the statistics of the American Institute of Family Relations over its first 30 years. Under his direction, the Institute gave intensive training to over 300 marriage counselors and shorter courses around the US to over 1500 other people. The caseload thrny averaged about 15,000 consultations per year. From the files of the numerous cases came the material for the \\"Can This Marriage Be Saved?\\" book and serial. The Institute published a bulletin, \\"Family Life,\\" monthly or bimonthly for decades. Given the role of clergy in responding to crisis in families, Popenoe increased focus in training the clergy over many years. That culminated in 1978 with the American Institute of Family Relations creating the Pastoral Psychotherapy Training Program, which offered the Master of Arts in Pastoral Psychotherapy. It was the second offering of a master's degree by the Institute. As Popenoe maintained his traditional values (chastity before marriage), changes in popular culture such as feminism and sexual revolution challenged his approach. At the same time, thought leaders in the helping professions tended more and more to favor self-fulfillment over preservation of the family. That led Popenoe to ally increasingly with religious conservatives even though he was not religious himself. For example, one of his assistants was James Dobson, who founded Focus on the Family in 1977. In the US society of the third millennium, the approach Popenoe developed to marriage counseling, ieducational and directive rather than medical or psychological, is becoming fashionable again. In the end, the American Institute of Family Relations turned out to be highly dependent on Popenoe's leadership. It closed in the 1980s, not long after Paul Popenoe's death. Popenoe died on 19 June 1979 in Miami, Florida. Archives Shortly before his death, Popenoe transferred his papers to the University of Wyoming. In 2002, the American Heritage Center of the University of Wyoming reported the collection Paul Bowman Popenoe Papers, 1874-1991, consisting of 85 cubic feet of material. The archives of the Human Betterment Foundation are in Special Collections at Caltech in Pasadena.

The device is also known as a multifuse or polyfuse or polyswitch. They are similar in function to PTC thermistors in certain situations but operate on mechanical changes instead of charge carrier effects in semiconductors. These devices were first discovered and described by Gerald Pearson at Bell Labs in 1939 and described in US patent #2,258,958.U.S. Patent 2258958.: \\"Conductive device\\", filed 13 Jul 1939, retrieved 7 mar 2017. Operation A polymeric PTC device is made up of a non-conductive crystalline organic polymer matrix that is loaded with carbon black particles to make it conductive. While cool, the polymer is in a crystalline state, with the carbon forced into the regions between crystals, forming many conductive chains. Since it is conductive (the \\"initial resistance\\"), it will pass a current. If too much current is passed through the device the device will begin to heat. As the device heats, the polymer will expand, changing from a crystalline into an amorphous state. The expansion separates the carbon particles and breaks the conductive pathways, causing the device to heat faster and expand more, further raising the resistance. This increase in resistance substantially reduces the current in the circuit. A small (leakage) current still flows through the device and is sufficient to maintain the temperature at a level which will keep it in the high resistance state. Leakage current can range from less than a hundred mA at rated voltage up to a few hundred mA at lower voltages. The device can be said to have latching functionality. The hold current is the maximum current at which the device is guaranteed not to trip. The trip current is the current at which the device is guaranteed to trip. When power is removed, the heating due to the leakage current will stop and the PPTC device will cool. As the device cools, it regains its original crystalline structure and returns to a low resistance state where it can hold the current as specified for the device. This cooling usually takes a few seconds, though a tripped device will retain a slightly higher resistance for hours, unless the power in it is weaker, or has been often used, slowly approaching the initial resistance value. The resetting will often not take place even if the fault alone has been removed with the power still flowing as the operating current may be above the holding current of the PPTC. The device may not return to its original resistance value; it will most likely stabilize at a significantly higher resistance (up to 4 times initial value). It could take hours, days, weeks or even years for the device to return to a resistance value similar to its original value, if at all. A PPTC device has a current rating and a voltage rating. Applications These devices are often used in computer power supplies, largely due to the PC 97 standard (which recommends a sealed PC that the user never has to open), and in aerospace/nuclear applications where replacement is difficult. Another application for such devices is protecting audio loudspeakers, particularly tweeters, from damage when over driven: by putting a resistor or light bulb in parallel with the PPTC device it is possible to design a circuit that limits total current through the tweeter to a safe value instead of cutting it off, allowing the speaker to continue operating without damage when the amplifier is delivering more power than the tweeter could tolerate. While a fuse could also offer similar protection, if the fuse is blown, the tweeter cannot operate until the fuse is replaced.Loudspeaker application note Device trade names These devices are sold by different companies under various trademarks, including Multifuse (Bourns), PolySwitch (TE Connectivity), and Polyfuse (Littelfuse).

Heliocentric theory Seleucus is known to have been a follower of the heliocentric theory of Aristarchus of Samos, which stated that the Earth rotated around its own axis which in turn revolved around the Sun.Russell, Bertrand ‚Äî History of Western Philosophy (2004) - p. 215We do not know other names of ancient astronomers or scientists who supported the heliocentric system: Hipparchus and later Ptolemy contributed to the success of the geocentric system; however, in the writings of Plutarch and Sextus Empiricus we read of \\"the followers of Aristarchus\\", thus it is probable that other people we do not know of adhered to the heliocentric view. According to Plutarch, Seleucus was the first to demonstrate the heliocentric system through reasoning, but it is not known what arguments he used. According to Bartel Leendert van der Waerden, Seleucus may have constructed his heliocentric theory by determining the constants of a geometric model and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model, as Nicolaus Copernicus later did in the 16th century. He may have used trigonometric methods that were available in his time, as he was a contemporary of Hipparchus. Since the time of Heraclides Ponticus (387 BC-312 BC), the inferior planets Mercury and Venus have been at times named solar planets, as their positions diverge from the Sun by only a small angle. According to the Greek geographer Strabo, Seleucus was also the first to assume the universe to be infinite. None of his original writing have survived, though a fragment of his work has survived only in Arabic translation, which was later referred to by the Persian philosopher Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (865-925). Tides According to Lucio Russo, Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric theory were probably related to the phenomenon of tides.Lucio Russo, Flussi e riflussi, Feltrinelli, Milano, 2003, . The annual cycle of tides (which was studied by Seleucus) can indeed hardly be explained in a geocentric system. Seleucus correctly theorized that tides were caused by the Moon, explaining that the interaction was mediated by the pneuma. He noted that the tides varied in time and strength in different parts of the world. According to Lucio Russo, Seleucus ascribed tides both to the Moon and to a whirling motion of the Earth, which could be interpreted as the motion of the Earth around the Earth-Moon center of mass. According to Strabo (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun. Seleucus in Strabo Seleucus is known from the writings of Plutarch, Aetius, and Strabo, all of whom were Greeks, and the Persian Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi. Strabo lists Seleucus as one of the four most influential \\"Chaldean\\" astronomers: > In Chapter XVI of his Geographia, Strabo mentions several \\"Chaldaen\\" > astronomers. At the end he adds: \\"Seleukios of Seleukia was a Chaldaean > too.\\" ...

Areas frequently covered by such agreements include the development of political, trade, social, cultural and security links. The legal basis for the conclusion of the association agreements is provided by art. 217 TFEU (former art. 310 and art. 238 TEC). Association Agreements are broad framework agreements between the EU (or its predecessors) and its member states, and an external state which governs their bilateral relations. The provision for an association agreement was included in the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, as a means to enable co-operation of the Community with the United Kingdom, which had retreated from the treaty negotiations at the Messina Conference of 1955. According to the European External Action Service, for an agreement to be classified as an AA, it must meet several criteria: The EU typically concludes Association Agreements in exchange for commitments to political, economic, trade, or human rights reform in a country. In exchange, the country may be offered tariff-free access to some or all EU markets (industrial goods, agricultural products, etc.), and financial or technical assistance. Most recently signed AAs also include a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and the third country. Association Agreements have to be accepted by the European Union and need to be ratified by all the EU member states and the state concerned. Names and types AAs go by a variety of names (e.g. Euro-Mediterranean Agreement Establishing an Association, Europe Agreement Establishing an Association) and need not necessarily even have the word \\"Association\\" in the title. Some AAs contain a promise of future EU membership for the contracting state. The first states to sign such an agreement were Greece (1961) and Turkey in (1963). In recent history, such agreements have been signed as part of two EU policies: Stabilisation and Association Process (SAp) and European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). The countries of the western Balkans (official candidates Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia, and potential candidates Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo) are covered by SAp. All six have \\"Stabilisation and Association Agreements\\" (SAA) with the EU in force. The countries of the Mediterranean (Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia) and Eastern Europe neighbours (Armenia, Azerbaijan and Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, but excluding Russia that insists on creating four EU-Russia Common Spaces) are covered by ENP. Seven of the Mediterranean states have a \\"Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association\\" (EMAA) with the EU in force, while Palestine has an interim EMAA in force. Syria initialled an EMAA in 2008, however signing has been deferred indefinitely. Negotiations for a Framework Agreement with the remaining state, Libya, have been suspended. Moldova and Ukraine, of the Eastern Partnership, have Association Agreements in force. Armenia completed negotiations for a AA in 2013 but decided not to sign the agreement, while Azerbaijan has been negotiating an AA. Both the SAA and ENP AP are based mostly on the EU's acquis communautaire and its promulgation in the co-operating states legislation. Of course the depth of the harmonisation is less than for full EU members and some policy areas may not be covered (depending on the particular state). In addition to these two policies, AAs with free-trade agreement provisions have been signed with other states and trade blocs including Chile, and South Africa.

Personnel  Besides the main film personnel, such as actors, director, cinematographer or sound engineer and their respective assistants (assistant director, camera assistant, boom operator), the unit production manager plays a decisive role in principal photography. They are responsible for the daily implementation of the shoot, managing the daily call sheet, the location barriers, transportation and catering. In addition, there are numerous other roles that serve the organization and the orderly sequence of the production, such as grips or gaffers. Other roles are related with the preparation of a daily production report, which shows the progress of the production compared to the schedule and contains further reports. This includes the storyboard with instructions for the copier and the editing room, the continuity notes for compliance with editing details and a report on unforeseen events. In addition, a sound report is created, which, similar to the production report, contains detailed information on the recorded material, but with regard to the sound recordings. Other typical roles during filming are the script supervisor to record changes to the script and the still photographer to produce images for advertising and documentation.  Process  = Preparation = Principal photography can take place in a studio or in an actual setting, and the choice of location depends on artistic and economic aspects. While shooting in a sound stage offers more accurate planning, constructing sets may be expensive. Costs and artistic reasons (see French New Wave and Dogma 95) are the main drives behind filming on location. However, outdoor shooting requires more effort because equipment and personnel must be transported to the location. While in the early days of cinema filmmakers tried to film outdoors as much as possible as sunlight allowed exposing the still relatively insensitive film, nowadays, due to the increased use of CGI, more and more shooting is done in a studio. Depending on the laws of the respective country, the producer must obtain filming permits from private individuals, authorities or companies for the selected locations before filming begins. An extensive production may require closing the respective area with signs and diversions. A filming permit within urban area usually requires a fee, which depends on the complexity and scope of the filming as well as the attractiveness of the location. Once the locations have been set, the screenplay is summarized in a script breakdown with all information relevant to the shooting. The organizational sequence of the shooting is then created in the form of the shooting schedule, specifying the locations, decorations and the necessary personnel and equipment, sorted by date and time. The sequence of the scenes to be shot is not chronological but rather depends on organizational aspects such as the availability of the actors and, in the case of outdoor shots, on the season, weather and light conditions. There is also a production breakdown for each day of shooting, which summarizes the relevant information from the schedule and lists exactly who has to be on the set for a planned daily shoot. At the same time, it provides information about the scene numbers, script pages and locations relevant for the day, as well as the necessary equipment. Feature films usually have insurance in place by the time principal photography begins. The death of a bankable star before completing all planned takes or the loss of sets or footage can render a film impossible to complete as planned. Furthermore, professional quality movie cameras are usually rented as needed, and most camera houses do not allow rentals of their equipment without proof of insurance. = Main shooting = Principal photography is typically the most expensive phase of film production, due to actor, director, and set crew salaries, as well as the costs of certain shots, props, and on-set special effects. When filming begins, the preparation time is over: the final version of the script is done, the cast has been selected, and the buildings on the set have largely been completed. That generally marks a point of no return for the financiers, because until it is complete, there is unlikely to be enough material filmed to release a final product needed to recoup costs. While it is common for a film to lose its greenlight status during pre production ‚Äì for example, when an essential cast member drops out or unexpectedly dies, or some scandal engulfs the studio or an actor ‚Äì it is rare for the film to lose financing once principal photography has begun. Immediately before a take is shot, the scene is rehearsed with camera, light and sound. Most American productions follow a specific procedure: The assistant director (AD) calls \\"picture is up!\\" to inform everyone that a take is about to be recorded, and then \\"quiet, everyone!\\" Once everyone is ready to shoot, the AD calls \\"roll sound\\" (if the take involves sound), and the production sound mixer will start their equipment, record a verbal slate of the take's information, and announce \\"sound speed\\", or just \\"speed\\", when they are ready. The AD follows with \\"roll camera\\", answered by \\"speed!\\" by the camera operator once the camera is recording. The clapper, who is already in front of the camera with the clapperboard, calls \\"marker!\\" and slaps it shut. If the take involves extras or background action, the AD will cue them (\\"action background!\\"), and last is the director, telling the actors \\"action!\\". The AD may echo \\"action\\" louder on large sets. A take is over when the director calls \\"Cut!\\" and the camera and sound stop recording. The ritual helps the general concentration at the location and allows saving costs by only recording the scene rather than the preparation for the scene. Each shot is repeated until the director is satisfied with it. In addition to the actual film crew that does the principal photography (unit), there may be a second team (second unit), which in turn comprises a full film crew with its own director, especially for more complex productions. The second unit works independently but in coordination with the director of the overall project and is responsible for city and landscape shots, establishing shots and intermediate images as well as for mass, action and stunt scenes. The length of the filming depends not only on the length of the film, but also on the number and type of locations. The shooting time for a 90-minute film in Europe is 12 to 100 days. In the USA, depending on the film project, a shooting time of 15 to 20, 40 to 50 or, for larger productions, 80 to 100 days is used as a basis for studio productions, although in other countries the shooting takes considerably longer. Because of breaks in recording and subsequent shoots that are difficult to calculate, the principal photography is usually planned longer than actually necessary. Once a film concludes principal photography, it is said to have wrapped, and a wrap party may be organized to celebrate. During post-production, it may become apparent that some shots or sequences are missing or incomplete and are required to complete the film, or that a particular scene is not playing as expected, or that a performer needs to be replaced entirely. In these circumstances, additional material may have to be shot. = Follow-ups = When using analog cameras, the exposed photographic film from the previous day is viewed by the director, cinematographer and producer to determine whether reshooting is needed. With digital cameras, the so-called dailies can be viewed immediately after the recording. If the material has proven to be inadequate or faulty, a re-shoot will be carried out on the day of shooting (digital) or on the day of the sampling (analog). Extra shooting after the entire filming process may be needed because the material has subsequently turned out to be unusable or additional shots are required. For example, deficiencies in the narrative structure may become apparent after the filming. Other reasons for re-shoots may be the production company's wish to make the film more commercial, or the consideration of actors whose performance was lacking or who do not fit the project afterwards and have to be replaced. If the material has already been shot once or is substantial, this process is referred to as a re-shoot. However, if the material is new and relatively minor, it is often referred to as a pick-up.

He moved to Egypt as a teenager and lived in various countries, both in the Middle East and in Europe, during the past 30 years. He has now settled in Amsterdam with his Dutch wife and their children and has taken Dutch nationality.  Biography  He comes from a Coptic Christian background. Although his father's family was Coptic, the father was converted to Protestantism and became a Protestant minister. This religious, and more specifically Christian, background is an important part of the struggle with identity and belonging which becomes apparent in much of Mus'ad‚Äôs writing. He was born in Port Sudan, an Eastern Port on the Red Sea, in 1937 and lived the first years of his life there, before moving with his family to Wad Madani, to the south east of Khartoum on the Blue Nile. From here he was sent to boarding school in Asyut in Middle Egypt, from where he returned to Wad Madani for the summer holidays before his father‚Äôs work prompted the family to finally relocate to Luxor-Egypt. He studied journalism at the University of Cairo and graduated in 1960. It was in Cairo in 1954 that he first joined a small underground Marxist organisation initially called ‚ÄòThe Vanguard of the Workers and Fellaheen‚Äô and then later renamed ‚ÄòThe Party of the Workers and Fellaheen‚Äô. In Cairo, the family moved around various areas, including al- Fajjala and Deir al-Malaak, in increasing poverty because his father had fallen seriously ill and could no longer work. In Nasser's Egypt, Communist organisations were illegal and political activity was a dangerous pursuit punished with imprisonment. During the Suez Crisis of 1956 Mus'ad was arrested whilst handing out leaflets urging popular resistance to the foreign occupation of the Suez Canal Zone. He and his comrades were held for one night and then released. In December 1960 he was again arrested at the family flat in Deir al-Malaak after a na√Øve attempt to escape and disappear. He was held for seven months before being brought before a military court in Alexandria and sentenced for Years imprisonment. He spent another seven or eight months in custody in Alexandria before being moved to the oases prisons where he stayed until the mass releases of 1964. It was in prison that he met and befriended the writers Sonallah Ibrahim and Kamal al-Qalash, with whom he co- authored his first book In 1956. After his release, in 1964, he started to work as a journalist and began his literary work: plays, stories and reportage. In 1970 he moved to Warsaw, where he studied theatrical production and got married, After he finished his scholarship. He lived in Poland for five years, during which time he visited many Soviet Block countries. This was the start of a long period of self-imposed exile which saw him establish himself in Baghdad (1975) and Beirut (1979) before returning briefly to Egypt in 1982. In Baghdad he worked in the Cinema and Theatre Foundation and met the woman who would become his next wife (after divorcing his Polish wife). In Lebanon he worked as a journalist for the newspaper as-Safir,and other magazines \\"El Louts the magazine of Afro-Asia Union of Writers\\" and lived in Beirut through the Israeli siege of 1982, where he worked in Beirut El Mesa'a the magazine of the Communist Workers Organisation which is what eventually forced him to leave Beirut and return to Egypt. He moved to the Netherlands in 1990, To live with his new family after he met the Dutch lady In Cairo, who became the mother of his children and thy married .He settled in Amsterdam, where he has lived and worked since. He has, in his own words, ‚Äòattained a certain amount of fame‚Äô and has been active in the media, contributing to cultural and political debates, such as the consequences of the war in Iraq and taking part in a televised debate on censorship alongside the celebrated Arab poets Mahmoud Darwish and Adunis. In 2004 he established in Amsterdam a small publishing house, in collaboration with a number of other Arab writers living outside the Arab world. Named ‚ÄòMuhajiroun‚Äô, the publisher is intended to print the works of Arab writers free from the difficulties of publishing in the Arab world, which Mus'ad sees as being beset by problems engendered by ‚Äòthe state of decline in the Arab political scene‚Äô. Before that he established a Publishing House in Cairo called \\"DAR Shouhdi \\" on the name of a communist leader who was killed in Naser prisons under torture with the help of Shouhdi's widow and his daughter hanan.

The battle was an episode in the Cretan War from 1645 to 1669 between the Venetian Republic (along with its allies, the Knights of Malta, the Kingdom of France and the Papal States) and the Ottoman Empire over dominance of various territories in the Mediterranean Sea. The war was one in a series of wars between the two warring powers, which contested for control of the Adriatic and Mediterranean trade routes. The primary territory that was contested during the war was Crete, the largest and most profitable of the overseas holdings of the Venetian Republic. The battle came after a squadron of Venetian ships under the command of Giacomo da Riva, a Venetian admiral, came to the rescue of the blockading Venetian force in the Dardanelles Straits, after the blockade had run into unexpected weather conditions and many ships sunk as a result.Anderson, (1952) Admiral da Riva moved to engage the Ottoman fleet, attempting to prevent them from sailing to Crete and reinforcing the Ottoman forces that were laying siege to the island. To reinforce his fleet before engaging the Ottomans, da Riva hired several English and Dutch armed merchantmen, promising to their captains that he would compensate them for any damages or casualties that they suffered. The Venetian fleet set sail towards the harbour, with the intention to destroy the Ottoman fleet while it was trapped. When the Ottomans saw that the Venetian fleet advancing, ten galleasses were placed in front of the harbour entrance to cover the other ships. The Venetians easily broke through the galleasses, and intense combat began and lasted for four hours, with the Venetian (and hired) warships engaging the Ottoman fleet, easily overwhelming them with superior firepower. The Ottomans put up a spirited defence, but could not stop the Venetians from destroying a significant portion of the fleet. Despite the overwhelming victory, it was not a complete one, and Ottoman naval forces were able to sail to Crete to bring reinforcements, with Crete falling to the Ottomans two decades later.Anderson, (1952) Background A Venetian engraving of the Kingdom of Candia, by Francesco Basilicata After the loss of Cyprus to the Ottomans in the fourth Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1570‚Äì1573), the island of Crete (the \\"Kingdom of Candia\\") was the last major overseas possession of the Venetian Republic. Its important strategic position made it an obvious target for future Ottoman expansion, while its size and fertile ground, together with the bad state of its fortresses, made it a more tempting prize than Malta. On the Venetian side, the Serenissima, with its weak military and great dependence on uninterrupted trade, was anxious not to provoke the Ottomans. Hence Venice scrupulously observed the terms of its treaty with the Ottomans, securing over sixty years of peaceful relations. By the early 17th century moreover, Venetian power had declined considerably. Its economy, which had once prospered because of its control over the Eastern spice trade , had suffered as a result of the opening of the new Atlantic trade routes, and from the loss of the important German market because of the Thirty Years' War. In 1645, the war broke out as Ottoman forces moved to capture Crete from the Venetians.Anderson, (1952) A Venetian fleet had been ordered to blockade the Dardanelles Straits since April of 1648. On 19 November, most of the fleet withdrew, leaving thirteen warships, under da Riva to maintain the blockade. In Spring 1649, he was joined by Bertucci Civrano with seven more warships, bringing up the total strength of his fleet to nineteen warships, as he had lost a warship to bad weather in the previous months. In early May, the Ottoman fleet appeared from the direction of Istanbul. Only two of Riva's ships actually managed to engage them, and in the ensuing chaos, the Ottoman fleet safely made it out of the Strait and headed southwards. Giacomo da Riva, marshaling his fleet, ordered them to follow and successfully trapped the Ottoman fleet at the port of Focchies, on the mainland. Many of the Venetian ships were hired Dutch or English armed merchantmen, and da Riva had to promise to compensate their captains for any damage, due to da Riva realizing that the Dutch or English captains would be unwilling to risk their ships unless they knew that they were going to be adequately compensated for their efforts. On May 12, da Riva ordered his fleet to sail into the harbour and engage the Ottoman ships lying at anchor.Anderson, (1952) Battle Leading the action from his flagship, the Rotta Fortuna, da Riva led his into the harbour. The larger and taller Venetian warships easily smashed aside the galleasses, and the minuscule amount of cannon that a single galleass could carry was no match for the dozens of cannons carried by the Venetian warships. Three galleasses were destroyed, with the rest being damaged and scattered, leaving the path into the harbour clear. The warships, one by one, sailed into the harbour and began engaging the Ottoman warships, aiming to use their overwhelming power to capture the warships and sink the galleys, which carried only a few cannons. The warships moved to engage, as they could withstand the broadside of the Venetian ones in a one-on-one engagement. However, da Riva was short one warship during the engagement, as the captain of the Esperienza had refused to sail into the harbour at all, instead keeping out to sea and only rejoining the fleet on the next day. During the action, the Ottoman fleet was slowly overwhelmed and destroyed, as the crews proved no match for Venetian, English and Dutch ones in terms of gunnery skill and seamanship, with many abandoning their ships as they sunk in the harbour.Anderson, (1952) Once the battle looked to be clearly in the Venetians favour, da Riva ordered men from his ships to set alight and burn the sinking Ottoman ships, as there was still a risk they could be re-floated, and being impossible to be towed out the harbour. In an unusual occurrence during a naval engagement, the galley slaves of one of the Ottoman galleys managed to overwhelm her crew and row towards a Venetian warship, whereupon the liberated slaves promptly surrendered the galley. Two of the smaller warships, the San Bartolamio, and the Francese, were abandoned by their crew due to damage incurred by Ottoman cannonade. The San Bartolamio was able to be successfully regained by the crew of the Tre Re, whereas the Francese drifted onto the shore and was burnt and destroyed by Ottoman soldiers while beached. When the action was concluding, da Riva surveyed the scene to see a spectacular success- nine warships burnt, three galleasses burnt, two galleys burnt, and one of each type captured. However, at midnight, the wind changed, and the fires set by the Venetians threatened to burn their own warships to the waterline. Upon seeing this, da Riva gave the order to retreat, and the action concluded.Anderson, (1952) Aftermath A Dutch engraving of the Siege of Candia, by Nicolaes Visscher II In total, the Venetian fleet suffered 105 men killed or wounded, alongside one warship destroyed, burnt by the Ottomans after it drifted onto the shore after being abandoned. The Venetian fleet suffered another loss just ten days later- the James, which had captured the galleass during the battle and was dismasted during the fighting- sunk in heavy weather due to damage sustained during the battle. The casualties for the Ottoman fleet was devastating, although not absolute- they still had one warship, seven galleasses, and sixty-nine galleys still intact alongside their crews. The reason for so many ships surviving was due to the wind moving the direction of the flames away from the rest of the Ottoman fleet, and causing the Venetian fleet to withdraw. In the days following the action, da Riva made no attempt to follow up on his victory, but after waiting near Focchies ordered his fleet to weigh anchor and sail towards the Gulf of Smyrna, where he hoped to prevent Christian ships from entering in the service of the Ottoman Navy. Failing to sight any ships, da Riva instead ordered his fleet to sail towards Crete, to link up with Captain General Alvise Mocenigo, who da Riva had written a letter to when he saw the Ottoman fleet leaving the Dardanelles Strait.Anderson, (1952) On May 23rd, da Riva, along with his fleet reached Nixa, waiting there for six days until Mocenigo joined forces with him. Mocenigo brought with him four warships, six galleasses and twenty-one galleys from Crete. Mocenigo dissuaded da Riva from launching patrols in the region to search for Ottoman ships, instead holding their position and stopping any significant Ottoman force from reaching Chania. In early June, the Kapudan Pasha left for Rhodes, merging the ships that had not been destroyed into a larger fleet. This fleet was joined by warships and galleys from Egypt and the Barbary States, and reached a size of eighty-three galleys and seventy-four warships, along with countless smaller vessels such as xebecs and gunboats. By late June his fleet arrived at Tine, and from there he sailed towards Milo in preparation for the final journey to Chania. Around the same time, da Riva was stationed at Santorin, but was able to sail to Milo to intercept the Ottoman fleet. However, neither fleet was willing to risk an all-out engagement, and both sides withdrew, the Ottoman fleet allowed to sail unmolested towards Chania. The fleet was able to assist in the ongoing siege, which eventually fell to the Ottomans in 1669, bringing an end to the war in favour of the Ottomans.Anderson, (1952) See also * Cretan War (1645-1669) * Venetian Navy * Ottoman Navy References Bibliography * Focchies 1716 1716 Focchies Phocaea 1640s in the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Battle of Focchies"},{"id":"982141","text":"John BullJohn Bull (1562 or 1563 ‚Äì 12 March 1628)John Bull on hoasm.org, retrieved 28 june 2017 was an English composer, musician and organ builder. He was a renowned keyboard performer of the virginalist school and most of his compositions were written for this medium. Life Bull's place of birth is shrouded in uncertainty. In an article published in 1952, Thurston Dart presumed that Bull's family originated in Somerset, where it is possible the composer was born. It was the 17th-century antiquarian Anthony Wood who first proposed that he was related to the Bull family of Peglich, Somerset, but in 1959 Dart wrote that Bull was probably the son of a London goldsmith‚Ä¶.Thurston Dart: Search for the Real John Bull. New York Times, 1 November 1959, sec. 2, p.1 Then, in the second edition of his Calendar of the Life of John Bull, Dart proposed Hereford as a third possibility.John Bull: Keyboard Music. Calendar of the Life of John Bull, compiled by Thurston Dart, vol I, p. xxi. More recent research by Susi Jeans suggests that Bull was born in the Radnorshire parish of Old Radnor within the diocese of Hereford, although no birth records have yet been discovered. Bull's appointment as organist of Hereford Cathedral in 1582 lends credence to this diocese being his place of birth: it was customary at this time for organists to return to their home cathedrals after training in London (cf: Thomas Morley). Hereford Cathedral, 17th-century engraving In 1573 he joined the choir at Hereford Cathedral, and the next year joined the Children of the Chapel Royal in London, where he studied with John Blitheman and William Hunnis; in addition to singing he learned to play the organ at this time. After being appointed to the Merchant Taylor's Company in 1577‚Äì78, Bull received his first appointment as organist of Hereford Cathedral in 1582, and then became Master of the Children there. In 1586 he received his degree from Oxford, and he became a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal that same year. In 1591, following the death of John Blitheman, he became organist at the Chapel Royal; in 1592 he received his doctorate from Oxford, and in 1596 he became the first professor of music at Gresham College on the recommendation of Queen Elizabeth, who admired him. There is some evidence that she sent Bull on espionage missions: his eighteen-month trip to the continent in 1601‚Äì02, ostensibly for health reasons, has never been satisfactorily explained, and his whereabouts there, apart from a visit to Brussels, remain a mystery.Leigh Henry, pp.153‚Äì170.Walker Cunningham, p.3 On the death of Elizabeth, he entered into the service of King James, establishing a reputation as a skilled composer, keyboard performer and improviser. However, in addition to his virtuosity as a keyboard performer and composer, Bull was also skilled at getting into trouble. In 1597 his appointment to Gresham College required him to obey the committee's ordinances, lodge at Gresham House, and give an inaugural lecture during the second week of June in the presence of the mayor, the aldermen, the Bishop of London and the master and warden of the Mercers Company. Fearful of losing his readership because his assigned rooms were still occupied by Thomas Gresham's stepson, William Reade, he forced an entry to the rooms by engaging a mason to help him break down a wall, which led to an action against Bull in Star Chamber. The outcome of this case is not known. Ten years later, he was forced to leave his post at Gresham College on 20 December 1607, after he fathered a child pre-maritally with an Elizabeth Walter, thus losing his best source of income as well as his quarters.Jeans and Neighbour 2001, ¬ß2. Even though he filed a petition for a marriage licence two days after he lost his job, he never returned to the college. He married Elizabeth Walter in 1607, by whom he had a daughter. Just after publishing seven keyboard pieces in Parthenia, Bull left England for good, secretly and with great haste in October 1613, fleeing the wrath of George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, and King James himself; the charge this time was adultery. William Trumbull, the English envoy in the Low Countries, after first attempting to cover for him ‚Äì but later fearing for his own position if he continued to do so ‚Äì wrote to the King in early 1614: The Archbishop of Canterbury had said of him the previous year: \\"the man hath more music than honesty and is as famous for marring of virginity as he is for fingering of organs and virginals.\\" The archbishop described the case to Trumbull; Bull slept in a bed with his wife and two maidservants slept in a truckle bed underneath. One summer morning Bull made one of the maids take his place by his wife, while he slept with the other maid in the truckle bed. Bull had also assaulted a church minister in front of the congregation.HMC Downshire, vol. 4 (London, 1940), pp. 270‚Äì1. Antwerp Cathedral, painted c. 1820 by Domenico Quaglio the Younger. Bull worked as organist of the cathedral from 1615 until his death. Bull remained in Flanders, where it seems he stayed out of trouble. He was briefly employed at the Brussels court, but was released after Trumbull communicated King James's displeasure; he continued to receive money from the court until 1618.The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music, edited by Don Michael Randel (Belknap Press, 1996), p. 117. In 1615 Antwerp Cathedral appointed him as assistant organist, and as principal organist in 1617. Bull wrote a series of letters while in Flanders, including one to the mayor of Antwerp, claiming that the reason he left England was to escape religious persecution. Although there is no evidence that he was a Catholic, he wrote, somewhat ambiguously He seems to have been believed, for he was never extradited back to England in spite of Trumbull's complaining to the Archduke. While in Antwerp he most probably met Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, the most influential keyboard composer of the age. In the 1620s he continued his career as an organist, organ builder and consultant. He died in Antwerp and was buried on 15 March 1628 in the cemetery next to the cathedral. Works Bull was one of the most famous composers of keyboard music of the early 17th century, exceeded only by Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck in the Netherlands, Girolamo Frescobaldi in Italy, and, some would say, by his countryman and elder, the celebrated William Byrd. He left many compositions for keyboard, some of which were collected in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book. His first (and only) publication, in 1612 or 1613, was a contribution of seven pieces forming part of a collection of virginal music entitled Parthenia, or the Maydenhead of the First Musicke That Ever Was Printed for the Virginalls, dedicated to the 15-year-old Princess Elizabeth, who was his student, on the occasion of her betrothal to Frederick V, Elector Palatine of the Rhine. The other contributors to Parthenia were Bull's contemporaries William Byrd and Orlando Gibbons, among the most famous composers of the age. Bull also wrote an anthem, God the father, God the son, for the wedding in 1613 of the princess and the Elector Palatine. In addition to his keyboard compositions, he wrote verse anthems, canons and other works. His 5-part anthem Almighty God, which by the Leading of a Star, known colloquially as the Star Anthem, was the most popular Jacobean verse anthem, occurring in more contemporary sources than any other. Much of his music was lost when he fled England; some was destroyed, and some was stolen by other composers, though occasionally such misattributions can be corrected today based on stylistic grounds. One of the most unusual collections of music from the period is his book of 120 canons, an astonishing display of contrapuntal skill worthy of Ockeghem or J.S. Bach. Of the 120 canons, 116 are based on the Miserere. Techniques employed to transform the simple theme include diminution, augmentation, retrograde and mixed time signatures. Some of his music in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book is of a lighter character and uses whimsical titles: \\"A Battle and No Battle,\\" \\"Bonny Peg of Ramsey,\\" \\"The King's Hunt,\\" and \\"Bull's Good- Night.\\" He is sometimes credited with the composition of \\"God Save the Queen\\", the national and/or royal anthem of a number of Commonwealth realms, their territories, and the British Crown dependencies.Bradley, Ian.

Hueco Tanks Human habitation of the area dates back 10,000 years with the arrival of the Desert Archaic Culture. These people would have eaten mesquite beans, banana yucca and cactus fruits in Hueco Tanks. The region was inhabited by various peoples, from the Paleo-Indians who used Folsom points to hunt the Megafauna of North America, to the people of the 'Jornada Mogollon' (pronounced mo-goi-YONE). This site was once a Jornada Mogollon village, according to an archaeological dig of the ground between North Mountain and West Mountain. By about 700 years ago, the population of the village could no longer be sustained by the small agricultural area surrounding Hueco Tanks. At this point, a population shift occurred and settlements were formed on the nearby playas to the south, west, and northwest. There, they flourished until about 1450 A.D. when the area suffered from a series of severe droughts.\\"Hueco Tanks.\\" Texas Beyond History. Jan. 2008. Web. 22 Mar. 2011. . Although it took time, by about 1600 A.D. the region was inhabited by the Apache people, who moved in from Canada (see the Athabascans). Agriculture was introduced in the area sometime around 1000 A.D. and along with it, the development of the Jornada Mogollon Culture. The Jornada people built a village in the area and grew corn. Later the area was occupied by Mescalero and Lipan Apaches and Jumano people. Also using the area were Comanche, Kiowa and Tiguas. Spanish and Mexican travelers were rare visitors to the area. The Kiowa called the area the Tso-doi-gyata-de-dee, meaning \\"rock cave where they were surrounded.\\" In 1837, the Kiowa signed a treaty with the United States, however, shortly after Mexican soldiers forced them into a six-day siege in Hueco Tanks, during which most of them died. The earliest known modern graffiti dates back to the 1840s. The area was visited by United States Boundary Commissioner, John R. Bartlett, in 1852 who recorded some of the pictographs. Between 1858 and 1859, the Butterfield Overland Mail kept a stagecoach station in the area, but left when a better location was found to the south. An El Paso businessman, Juan Armadariz, purchased much of the Hueco Tanks land to use for ranching in 1895. Silverio Escontr√≠as bought the land from Armendariz in 1898 and the family used it as a ranch and tourist attraction until 1956. The early El Paso Archaeological Society (EPAS) began to campaign for the land to be turned into a park and in 1935, the National Park Service offered to buy the land from the Escontr√≠as family, but they refused. Fort Bliss leased land from the Escontr√≠as family for training purposes in the 1940s and 50s. The ranch went on the real estate market in 1956 and during this time, members of archaeological and historical societies raised awareness of the area's significance. El Paso County took over the land in the mid-1960s.leftIn 1968, it was discussed whether or not the park should be turned over to the Tiguas. In 1969, the El Paso County commissioners decided to deed the park to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission. It was made a Texas State Park in 1970. The park's information center was made from the old Escontr√≠as ranch house. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Archaeological excavations conducted by George Kegley took place in the area between 1972 and 1973. The park was named the Hueco Tanks State Historic Site in 1998.  Pictographs  pictographs, in a restricted area of Hueco Tanks State Historic Site near El Paso, Texas. The first paintings made at Hueco Tanks were done by members of the Desert Archaic Culture, and depicted abstract designs. These were created between 6000 and 3000 B.C. Between 3000 BC and 450 A.D., pictures of animals and humans were drawn on the rocks. Most of the pictographs at Hueco Tanks are of Jornada Mogollon origin. The drawings may have been used in praying for rain. The Jornada's religion was influenced by Mesoamerican religions. Many of the Hueco Tanks drawings depicted Tlaloc, a rain god and Quetzalcoatl. Modern graffiti by Anglo people started appearing when someone painted \\"1849\\" over some of the original pictographs. The first scientific overview of the rock paintings at Hueco Tanks happened in the summer of 1939 with Forrest and Lula Kirkland recording the art. Most of the colors used in the paintings came from minerals in the area. The paintings themselves became bound to the rock through the aging process. In 1972, the El Paso Archaeological Society (EPAS) and the Anthropology Club of the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) systematically documented the drawings, their current conditions and sometimes relocated and inspected the rock art. The project discovered 300 previously unrecorded pictographs. The findings of their work was published in A Rock Art Inventory at Hueco Tanks State Park (1974). In 1988, park ranger Dave Parker and archeologist Ron Ralph plotted the location of all known pictographs. A digital database of the art and its GPS coordinates was started in 1999 with Robert Mark and Evelyn Billo.  Geology  One of the large \\"tanks\\" in Hueco Tanks State Park & Historic Site in the low mountains above El Paso, Texas. The syenite pluton was formed 34-38 million years ago, as part of a larger range, the Hueco Mountains, which range in age to over 320 million years ago, when this area was covered by an inland sea. The pluton was eventually exposed through weathering to form the rock formations visible today, which jut from the desert floor. The tanks were once capable of containing a year's supply of water. In addition to the tanks, there are several permanent springs and seasonal springs in the area. The area receives less than of rainfall a year. The syenite rock formation is covered with 'desert patina' (visible in the image below), the result of thousands of years of weathering of the rock surface by sun, sand, and water; the site is culturally and spiritually significant to many Native Americans, such as the Mescalero Apache, the Kiowa,Konate, a Kiowa was wounded at Hueco Tanks during an 1839 ambush by Mexican militia. Konate survived to return to his home in Oklahoma, where the story was preserved. the Hopi, and the Pueblo people. This significance is partially manifested in the pictographs (rock paintings) that can be found throughout the region, some of which are thousands of years old. Hueco Tanks contains the single largest concentration of mask paintings by Native Americans in North America, of which hundreds exist at this site.Forrest Kirkland & W.W. Newcomb (1967), Rock Art of the Texas Indians, Austin: University of Texas Press. Kirkland distinguishes two different styles of mask: 1) the outline mask 2) the solid mask. Wildlife Freshwater shrimp and spadefoot toads survive at the site; for this and other reasons, visitors are cautioned against touching the pools of water at Hueco Tanks to avoid destroying the eggs of these animals.Interpretive Center, Orientation Video, Hueco Tanks State Historic Site, 2009-12-26Spadefoot toads have re-spawned in Hueco Tanks, September 2010, due to the heavy monsoon rains this year. ‚ÄîEd Woton, Interpretive Guide, Hueco Tanks State Historic Site, Oct 17, 2010. Other amphibians seen in the park include barred tiger salamanders. Around 30 different species of reptiles live in the area. In 2002, 222 different species of bird were documented at the site during the year. Migratory birds such as waterfowl and songbirds pass through during migration seasons. Several birds such as the prairie falcon, burrowing owl, white throated swift, black-chinned hummingbird, ash throated flycatcher, Crissal thrasher, blue grosbeak, Scott's oriole and lesser goldfinch all likely breed in the area. The park is home today to mule deer, black bears, bobcats, gray fox, coyotes, badgers, ringtails, skunks, raccoons, mountain lions, black-tailed jackrabbits, desert cottontail, eastern cottontail, six species of bats and twenty species of rodents. Plants Around the syenite outcrops, the park is surrounded by Chihuahuan Desert scrub with creosote bush as the dominant species. The site contains enough water to support live oaks and junipers, species which survive from the last ice age. Other trees found in the area include netleaf hackberry, Texas mulberry, Mexican buckeye, Gregg acacia and Arizona oak. Hueco Tanks has the only population in the United States of the plant Colubrina stricta.  Rock climbing  Bouldering on North Mountain at Hueco Tanks Hueco Tanks is widely regarded as one of the best areas in the world for bouldering that is, rock climbing low enough to attempt without ropes for protection. It is unique for its rock type, the concentration and quality of the climbing. In any given climbing season, which generally lasts from October through March, it is common for climbers from across Europe, Asia, and Australia to visit the park. In February an outdoor bouldering competition known as the Hueco Rock Rodeo is held. The event is a world-class outdoor competition that attracts many professional climbers every year. Since implementation of the Public Use Plan in June 2000, following a brief closure of the entire park due to the park service's inability to manage the growing crowds of international climbers, more than two-thirds of the park is restricted to tours by volunteer or commercial guides. Only North Mountain is accessible without guides, and then only for about 70 people at any given time, except on the south side at ground level, which is closed to the public. The park offers camping and showers for $12 per night (as of April 2020), or, as is most popular for climbers, the nearby Hueco Rock Ranch offers camping where climbers can relax and socialize. This is also where commercial guides can be found, and where many volunteer guides stay during the climbing season.

The Genera and Species of Orchidaceous Plants. Ridgeways, Piccadilly: London, UK. He is generally recognized as the father of orchid taxonomy. The next important step was taken by George Bentham with a new classification, recognizing subtribes for the first time. This classification was first presented in a paper that Bentham read to the Royal Society in 1881.George Bentham. 1881. page 288. In: \\"Notes on Orchideae\\". The Journal of the Linnean Society. Botany. 18(110):281-367. (See External links below).Alec M. Pridgeon, Phillip J. Cribb, Mark W. Chase, and Finn N. Rasmussen. 1999-2014. Genera Orchidacearum. Oxford University Press.

Cambridge University Press. . 314 pages Genera Orchidacearum was published in 6 volumes over 15 years, from 1999 to 2014. It covers all of the known orchids, including a description of each genus. It reflects the considerable progress in orchid taxonomy that had been made since Dressler published his classification in 1993. In the 1990s, orchid taxonomy began to be influenced by molecular phylogenetics based on DNA sequences. The first molecular phylogenetic study to include a substantial sample of orchids was published in 1999.Kenneth M. Cameron, Mark W. Chase, W. Mark Whitten, Paul J. Kores, David C. Jarrell, Victor A. Albert, Tomohisa Yukawa, Harold G. Hills and Douglas H. Goldman. 1999. \\"A phylogenetic analysis of the Orchidaceae: evidence from rbcL nucleotide sequences\\". American Journal of Botany 86 (2): 208-224. (See External links below). The first classification that was based on cladistic analysis of DNA data was published by Chase et alii in 2003.Mark W. Chase, Kenneth M. Cameron, Russell L. Barrett, and John V. Freudenstein. 2003. \\"DNA data and Orchidaceae systematics: a new phylogenetic classification\\". pages 69-89. In: Kingsley W. Dixon, Shelagh P. Kell, Russell L. Barrett, and Phillip J. Cribb (editors). 2003. Orchid Conservation. Natural History Publications, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. . (See External links below). An update to that classification was published by Chase et alii in 2015.Mark W. Chase, Kenneth M. Cameron, John V. Freudenstein, Alec M. Pridgeon, Gerardo A. Salazar, C√°ssio van den Berg, and Andr√© Schuiteman. 2015. \\"An updated classification of Orchidaceae\\". Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 177 (2): 151-174. (See External links below). This classification takes a different approach from Genera Orchidacearum, by consolidating many of the tribes and subtribes, and by recognizing very widely circumscribed genera. As of 2015, Orchidaceae was not yet covered in The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants, though most of the vascular plant families had been covered by that time. The number of genera recognized in the family has varied from one classification to another. In Genera Orchidacearum, many genera were consolidated, reducing their number to 765, smaller than in any previous modern classification. In 2015, Chase et alii merged even more genera, reducing their number to 736. Useful resources include the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. Wikispecies (Orchidaceae) closely follows this source with modifications as they become accepted. The Plant List also has lists of genera and species, but no other taxonomic information. (Also see External links below).  History  The following taxonomy follows largely the classification system of Robert Louis Dressler, an orchid specialist and adjunct curator at the Florida Museum of Natural History. This classification, published in 1981 in the book The Orchids: Natural History and Classification, was widely accepted by botanists and growers before the publication of Genera Orchidacearum. The initial scheme of 1981 was modified in 1986, twice in 1990, and then again in 1993. This comprehensive classification relies heavily on morphology, especially a few key characters, such as anther configuration and pollinarium structure. Consequently, many of the taxa are not monophyletic. Cladistic analyses, especially those based on molecular data, provide a firmer basis for classification than intuition, and the certainty (or uncertainty) of conclusions can be quantified by measures of statistical support. While our understanding of orchid phylogeny has greatly improved in recent years, the elucidation of orchid relationships is still ongoing. When Dressler published his classification in 1993, the relationships of orchids to other monocots was still unknown. Some of the first molecular phylogenetic studies of monocots resolved the Orchidaceae as sister to the astelioid clade of the order Asparagales, but this result never had strong statistical support. It is now known that Orchidaceae is the most basal clade in Asparagales, with the astelioid clade diverging next. (See External links below).Peter F. Stevens (2001 onwards). \\"Orchidaceae\\" At: Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. At: Missouri Botanical Garden Website. (see External links below) According to cladistic analyses based on morphological character states or on nucleotide sequences, the orchid family is a monophyletic group. The subfamilies recognized by Dressler, however, were not all monophyletic. Dressler's delimitation of subfamilies was contradicted by subsequent studies of mitochondrial, chloroplast, and nuclear DNA sequences. In 2003, a new phylogenetic classification divided Orchidaceae into five subfamilies: Apostasioideae, Vanilloideae, Cypripedioideae, Orchidoideae, and Epidendroideae. These five subfamilies were all strongly supported as monophyletic groups in subsequent studies. In 2003, the position of Vanilloideae remained equivocal. The subfamilies Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae clearly formed a monophyletic group and Dressler believed that their closest relative was Vanilloideae. In 2006, a study based on the plastid genes rbcL and atpB found the closest relative of this pair to be Cypripedioideae, rather than Vanilloideae.Kenneth M. Cameron. 2006. \\"A comparison and combination of plastid atpB and rbcL gene sequences for inferring phylogenetic relationships within Orchidaceae\\". pages 447-464. In: J. Travis Columbus, Elizabeth A. Friar, J. Mark Porter, Linda M. Prince, and Michael G. Simpson (editors). Aliso 22 (Monocots: Comparative Biology and Evolution). 735 pages. Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden. printed by Allen Press: USA. This result had only weak maximum parsimony jackknife support, but in a phylogenomic study in 2015, it received strong maximum likelihood bootstrap support. Since 2006, phylogenies of two of the subfamilies, VanilloideaeKenneth M. Cameron. 2011. \\"Vanilloid Orchids: Systematics and Evolution\\". pages 1-14. In: Eric Odoux and Michel Grisoni (editors). Medicinal and Aromatic Plants - Industrial Profiles. CRC Press: Boca Raton FL, USA. and Epidendroideae have been published. Phylogenies of several tribes and subtribes have also been published. Compared to previous classifications, more of the tribes and subtribes of Dressler were monophyletic, but not all of them were supported by subsequent studies. In the classification that was published in 2015, the authors expressed doubt about their division of the tribes Orchideae and Vandeae into subtribes. The placement of the genera Pachites, Holothrix, and Hederorkis is especially problematical. The monophyly of the subtribe Cranichidinae is also in doubt. These authors singled out the tribe Podochileae, as well as the subtribes Oncidiinae, Goodyerinae, and Angraecinae as being in special need of phylogenetic study. The basal epidendroids, especially the tribe Gastrodieae, remain poorly sampled in phylogenetic studies.  Taxonomy  The orchid family (Orchidaceae) is subdivided into five subfamilies, and then into tribes and subtribes. Groups of closely related genera are sometimes referred to informally as alliances. An alliance is a group of taxa, at any taxonomic rank, but usually at the rank of genus or species, that are thought to be closely related. Alliances are designated provisionally and are not recognized in the ICNAFP. The subtribes are formally divided into genera. Some of the genera are divided into subgenera, and some of the subgenera are divided into sections. All of the genera contain at least one species. A special nomenclature is used to name hybrids between different species. About 150 species and about a dozen new genera were described each year from 2000 to 2015. According to Dressler, there are 5 subfamilies, 22 tribes, 70 subtribes, and about 850 genera of orchids. When he published his classification, only about 20,000 species of orchids were known. Several thousand have been described since then. A distinction between monandrous flowers and others is especially important in the classification of orchids. A monandrous flower is one that has only a single stamen. The flowers are monandrous in the subfamilies Vanilloideae, Orchidoideae, and Epidendroideae. Like many others before him, Dressler believed that the monandrous orchids form a monophyletic group. It is now known that monandry arose twice in the orchids, once in Vanilloideae, and again in the common ancestor of Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae. The other subfamilies, Apostasioideae and Cypripedioideae, have either three stamens or two stamens and a staminode. The following subfamilies are recognized: *Subfamily Apostasioideae: monophyletic - the most basal of the orchids: three fertile anthers or two fertile anthers and a filamentous staminode. *Subfamily Cypripedioideae: monophyletic - two fertile diandrous anthers, a shield-shaped staminode and a saccate (= pouch- like) lip. *Subfamily Orchidoideae: monophyletic - one fertile, monandrous, basitonic anther. **(Subfamily Spiranthoideae): now accepted as nested within a more broadly defined Orchidoideae as the sub-tribe Spiranthinae of the tribe Cranichideae. *Subfamily Epidendroideae: monophyletic - includes almost 80% of the orchid species; orchids with an incumbent to suberect (= ascending towards the edges) anther. **(Subfamily Higher Epidendroideae (formerly Vandoideae): specialised clade within a more broadly defined Epidendroideae *Subfamily Vanilloideae: monophyletic - an ancient clade now recognized as a distinct subfamily. Their phylogenetic position had long been controversial. Cladistically, the interrelationships of these subfamilies can be shown in a phylogenetic tree as follows: Subfamily Apostasioideae The subfamily Apostasioideae belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). All well-sampled molecular phylogenetic studies have produced strong bootstrap support for its position as sister to a clade consisting of the other orchid subfamilies. Bootstraping is a method of resampling for quantifying the statistical support for nodes in a phylogenetic tree (= a treelike diagram showing the evolutionary diversification of organisms). The apostasioid orchids are the most primitive orchids, with only two genera. Neuwiedia has three fertile, abaxial (= facing away from the stem) anthers, while Apostasia has two fertile abaxial anthers and a filamentous staminode (= a sterile stamen). Plants with mealy or paste-like pollen, which ordinarily are not aggregated into pellets, called pollinia, with two or three fertile long anthers, leaves with sheathing bases, elongated staminode and labellum similar to the petals. These primitive features make them, according to some authorities, not true orchids but rather ancestors of modern orchids. However, more recent studies indicate that many of their differences with the other orchids were not inherited from a common ancestor with orchids, but arose within the stem group of apostasioid orchids. ::Apostasia Blume, included Adactylus Rolfe and Mesodactylis Wall. ::Neuwiedia Blume Subfamily Cypripedioideae 6 genera with about 115 species, mostly terrestrials or lithophytes: =Tribe Cypripedieae= Lady Slipper orchid (Cypripedium pubescens) Subtribe Cypripediinae ::Cypripedium Lindl., included Arietinum Beck, Calceolaria Heist. ex Fabr., Calceolus Nieuwl., Ciripedium Zumagl., Criogenes Salisb., Fissipes Small, Hypodema Rchb., Sacodon Raf., Schizopedium Salisb., Stimegas Raf.

Shiller, a Yale University professor and 2013 Nobel Prize winner. The book examines economic bubbles in the 1990s and early 2000s, and is named after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's famed \\"irrational exuberance\\" quote warning of such a possible bubble in 1996. Overview Published at the height of the dot-com boom, the text put forth several arguments demonstrating how the stock markets were overvalued at the time. The stock market collapse of 2000 happened the exact month of the book's publication. The second edition of Irrational Exuberance was published in 2005 and was updated to cover the housing bubble. Shiller wrote that the real estate bubble might soon burst, and he supported his claim by showing that median home prices were six to nine times greater than median income in some areas of the country. He also showed that home prices, when adjusted for inflation, have produced very modest returns of less than 1% per year. Housing prices peaked in 2006 and the housing bubble burst in 2007 and 2008, an event partially responsible for the Worldwide recession of 2008-2009. The third edition of Irrational Exuberance was published in 2015 and included new material on bonds. Shiller warns of significant downside risk to holding long term bonds. Shiller also warns that global house prices are in bubble territory and that US Stock prices are high. Reactions There are some economists who challenge the predictive power of Shiller's publication. Eugene Fama, the Robert R. McCormick Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at The University of Chicago and co-recipient with Shiller of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Economics, has written that Shiller \\"has been consistently pessimistic about prices,\\"NOVA Mind-Over-Money Special so given a long enough horizon, Shiller is bound to be able to claim that he has foreseen any given crisis. Quotations :\\"[t]he stock market has not come down to historical levels: the price-earnings ratio as I define it in this book is still, at this writing [2005], in the mid-20s, far higher than the historical average. ‚Ä¶ People still place too much confidence in the markets and have too strong a belief that paying attention to the gyrations in their investments will someday make them rich, and so they do not make conservative preparations for possible bad outcomes.\\" Gallery Image:IE Real SandP Prices, Earnings, and Dividends 1871-2006.png|The plot of the S&P; Composite Real Price Index, Earnings, Dividends, and Interest Rates.

Donna Tartt (born December 23, 1963) is an American author. Tartt's novels include The Secret History (1992), The Little Friend (2002), and The Goldfinch (2013). Tartt won the WH Smith Literary Award for The Little Friend in 2003 and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for The Goldfinch in 2014. She was included in Time magazine's 2014 \\"100 Most Influential People\\" list.Patchett, Ann. \\"Donna Tartt\\". Early life  Tartt was born in Greenwood, Mississippi located in the Mississippi Delta, and raised in the nearby town of Grenada. Her father, Don Tartt, was a successful local politician, while her mother, Taylor, was a secretary. At age thirteen, Tartt was published for the first time when a sonnet was included in a Mississippi literary review. Tartt enrolled in the University of Mississippi in 1981, where her writing caught the attention of Willie Morris while she was a freshman. Following a recommendation from Morris, Barry Hannah, then an Ole Miss writer-in- residence, admitted the eighteen-year-old Tartt into his graduate course on the short story. \\"She was deeply literary,\\" said Hannah. \\"Just a rare genius, really. A literary star.\\" Following the suggestion of Morris and others, she transferred to Bennington College in 1982. At Bennington, Tartt studied classics with Claude Fredericks. Career Tartt published her first novel, The Secret History in 1992; it was well-received, with many considering her as a precocious literary genius, as she was just 29 years old, and setting high expectations for what she would publish next. In 2002, Tartt was reportedly working on a retelling of the myth of Daedalus and Icarus for the Canongate Myth Series, a series of novellas in which ancient myths are reimagined and rewritten by contemporary authors. In 2006, Tartt's short story The Ambush was included in the Best American Short Stories 2006. Her 2013 novel The Goldfinch stirred reviewers as to whether it was a literary novel, a controversy possibly based on its best-selling status. Tartt is a convert to Catholicism and contributed an essay, \\"The spirit and writing in a secular world\\", to The Novel, Spirituality and Modern Culture (2000). In her essay Tartt wrote that \\"...faith is vital in the process of making my work and in the reasons I am driven to make it\\". However, Tartt also warned of the danger of writers who impose their beliefs or convictions on their novels. She wrote that writers should \\"shy from asserting those convictions directly in their work\\". She spent about ten years writing each of her novels. Personal life  Tartt is notoriously private, and does not give talks at book festivals. A book tour every ten years is as much as she will handle. Her days are spent writing. Her day-to-day life is not lived like a recluse, she stated in a 2013 interview. She is a petite woman with a distinct sense of style in her appearance.

Produced and directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, it is the 21st Disney animated feature film. The story follows the adventures of Robin Hood, Little John, and the inhabitants of Nottingham as they fight against the excessive taxation of Prince John, and Robin Hood wins the hand of Maid Marian. The film features the voices of Brian Bedford, Phil Harris, Peter Ustinov, Pat Buttram, Monica Evans, and Carole Shelley. The idea to adapt Robin Hood into an animated feature dated back to Walt Disney's interest in the tale of Reynard the Fox during his first full-length feature production, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). The idea was repeatedly shelved until writer and production designer Ken Anderson incorporated ideas from it in a pitch of the legend of Robin Hood using anthropomorphic animals rather than people during the production of The Aristocats (1970). Robin Hood was released on November 8, 1973, to which it was initially received positively by film critics who praised the voice cast, animation, and humor yet its critical reception became gradually mixed since its release. The film was a box office success. Plot Narrated by Alan-a-Dale, we are introduced to Robin Hood and Little John who live in Sherwood Forest, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor townsfolk of Nottingham. Meanwhile, Prince John, the de facto King of England, sends his lead henchman, the Sheriff of Nottingham, to catch the two but he fails every time. Meanwhile, Prince John and his assistant Sir Hiss, arrive in Nottingham. Sir Hiss hypnotized Prince John's brother King Richard to go off on the Crusades, allowing Prince John to take the throne. Unfortunately, the prince is greedy and immature, even sucking his thumb whenever his mother is mentioned. Robin and Little John rob Prince John by disguising themselves as fortune tellers, prompting the prince to put a bounty on their heads and makes the Sheriff his personal tax collector. The Sheriff taxes the inhabitants of Nottingham excessively. However, Robin gives back some money to a family of rabbits and gives a bow and arrow and his hat to the young rabbit Skippy for his birthday. Skippy and his friends test out the bow, but Skippy fires an arrow into the grounds of Maid Marian's castle. Skippy sneaks inside, meeting Maid Marian and her lady-in-waiting Lady Kluck. Maid Marian reveals she and Robin were childhood sweethearts but they have not seen one another for years. Friar Tuck visits Robin and Little John, explaining that Prince John is hosting an archery tournament and the winner will receive a kiss from Maid Marian. Robin agrees to participate in the tournament in disguise whilst Little John arrives as the Duke of Chutney to get near Prince John. Sir Hiss discovers Robin's identity, but is trapped in a barrel of ale by Friar Tuck and Alan-a-Dale. Robin wins the tournament, but Prince John exposes him and sentences him to death despite Maid Marian's pleas. Little John threatens Prince John with a dagger which leads to a fight between Robin, Little John, Maid Marian, Lady Kluck, and Prince John's soldiers and culminates in Robin and his allies escaping. In the forest, Robin and Maid Marian share a romantic evening, then are surprised by his ‚Äúmerry men‚Äù who throw a party and sing a song mocking Prince John, describing him as the \\"Phony King of England\\". Enraged by the song, Prince John triples the taxes, imprisoning most of the townsfolk who cannot pay their taxes. The Sheriff visits Friar Tuck's church to steal from the poor box, which angers Friar Tuck and he attacks the Sheriff and is arrested. Prince John plans to hang Friar Tuck to lure in Robin and kill him. Robin and Little John sneak into the castle, with Little John managing to free all of the prisoners whilst Robin steals Prince John's gold, but Sir Hiss awakens to find Robin fleeing. Chaos ensues as Robin and the others try to escape to Sherwood Forest. However, the Sheriff corners Robin after he returns to rescue Skippy's younger sister. The two fight, accidentally setting fire to Prince John's castle and causing Robin to leap from a tower into the moat below. Little John and Skippy watch as the moat is pelted with arrows and Robin is presumably shot and drowned, only to emerge unharmed. Prince John despairs and is driven into a blind rage when Sir Hiss points out his mother's castle is on fire. Later, King Richard returns to England, places his brother, Sir Hiss, and the Sheriff under arrest and pardons Robin, allowing him and Maid Marian to marry and leave Nottingham with Little John and Skippy in tow. Cast * Brian Bedford as Robin Hood, a gifted archer who is devoted to helping the poor and downtrodden townspeople. He is portrayed as a fox. * Monica Evans as Maid Marian, a vixen, niece of King Richard and the primary love interest of Robin Hood. * Phil Harris as Little John, Robin Hood's best friend, who though not small at all is still called \\"Little John\\".

He is portrayed as a badger. * Peter Ustinov as Prince John, a greedy and cowardly lion who is the Prince Regent of England. He has the habit of sucking his thumb when someone mentions his mother. Ustinov also voiced Prince John in the German version of the film. **Ustinov also voices King Richard, John's older brother and the rightful King of England, who returns from the Third Crusade at the end of the film and sentences his brother to work in the Royal Rock Pile. Unlike John, Richard is depicted with a mane. * Terry-Thomas as Sir Hiss, Prince John's serpent advisor who is manipulative and prideful. * Carole Shelley as Lady Kluck, a Scottish hen who is the lady-in-waiting for Maid Marian. * Pat Buttram as the Sheriff of Nottingham, a heartless wolf who enjoys collecting taxes on behalf of Prince John. * George Lindsey and Ken Curtis as Trigger and Nutsy, respectively, vulture guardsmen. * John Fiedler and Barbara Luddy as Sexton and his wife, respectively, church mice.

Skippy, Sis, and Tagalong are rabbits while Toby is a turtle. * Candy Candido as the Captain of the Guard, a crocodile who hosts the archery tournament. * J. Pat O'Malley as Otto, a dog blacksmith with a lame leg. Production Around the time of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937, Walt Disney became interested in adapting the twelfth-century legend of Reynard the Fox. However, the project languished due to Walt's concern that Reynard was an unsuitable choice for a hero. eds. Tison Pugh, Susan Aronstein In a meeting held on February 12, 1938, Disney commented \\"I see swell possibilities in 'Reynard', but is it smart to make it? We have such a terrific kid audience ... parents and kids together. That's the trouble ‚Äì too sophisticated. We'll take a nosedive doing it with animals.\\" For Treasure Island (1950), Walt seriously considered three animated sections, each one of the Reynard tales, to be told by Long John Silver to Jim Hawkins as moral fables. Ultimately, the idea was nixed as Treasure Island became the studio's first fully live-action film. Over the years, the studio decided to make Reynard the villain of a musical feature film named Chanticleer and Reynard (based on Edmond Rostand's Chanticleer), but the production was scrapped in the early 1960s in favor of The Sword in the Stone (1963). While The Aristocats (1970) was in production, Ken Anderson began exploring possibilities for the next film. Studio executives favored a \\"classic\\" tale as the subject for the next film, in which Anderson suggested the tale of Robin Hood, which was received enthusiastically. He blended his ideas of Robin Hood by incorporating that the fox character could be slick but still use his skills to protect the community. Additionally, Anderson wanted to set the film in the Deep South desiring to recapture the spirit of Song of the South (1946). However, the executives were wary of the reputation of Song of the South, which was followed by Wolfgang Reitherman's decision to set the film in its traditional English location inspired by The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952). Veteran writer Larry Clemmons came on board the project by writing a script with dialogue that was later storyboarded by other writers. As production went further along, Robin Allan stated in his book Walt Disney and Europe that \\"Ken Anderson wept when he saw how his character concepts had been processed into stereotypes for the animation on Robin Hood.\\" According to Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, one such casualty was the concept of making the Sheriff of Nottingham a goat as an artistic experiment to try different animals for a villain, only to be overruled by Reitherman who wanted to keep to the villainous stereotype of a wolf instead. Additionally, Anderson wanted to include the Merry Men into the film, which was again overridden by Reitherman because he wanted a \\"buddy picture\\" reminiscent of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), so Little John was the only Merry Man who remained in the film, while Friar Tuck was put as a friend of Robin's who lived in Nottingham, and Alan-a-Dale was turned into the narrator. Because of the time spent on developing several settings and auditioning actors to voice Robin Hood, production fell behind schedule. In order to meet deadlines, the animators had no other choice but to recycle several dance sequences from previous Disney animated films, including Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), The Jungle Book (1967), and The Aristocats (1970). =Casting= By October 1970, most of the voice actors were confirmed, with the exception of Tommy Steele cast in the title role. Steele himself was chosen because of his performance in The Happiest Millionaire (1967) while Peter Ustinov was cast because Walt Disney had enjoyed his presence on the set of Blackbeard's Ghost (1968) during one of his last visits to the studio before his death. However, Steele was unable to make his character sound more heroic, and his replacement came down to final two candidates which were Bernard Fox and Brian Bedford. Disney executives had first seen Bedford performing onstage in Los Angeles, in which they brought him in to test for the role in May 1971 and ultimately cast him. Meanwhile, Louis Prima was so angered at not being considered for a role that he personally paid the recording expenses for the subsequent album, Let's \\"Hear\\" it For Robin Hood, which he sold to Disneyland Records. Release The film premiered at the Radio City Music Hall on November 8, 1973. The film was re-released on March 26, 1982. =Home media= The film was first released on VHS, CED, Betamax, and Laserdisc on December 3, 1984, becoming the debut installment of the Walt Disney Classics home video label. Disney had thought the idea of releasing any of its animated classics (known as the \\"untouchables\\") might threaten future theatrical reissue revenue. However, Robin Hood was viewed as the first choice since it was not held in such high esteem as some of the other titles. The release went into moratorium in January 1987. It was later re-released on VHS as an installment of the Walt Disney Classics on July 12, 1991. The film was re-released on October 28, 1994 and July 13, 1999 on VHS as an installment of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection lineup. In January 2000, Walt Disney Home Video launched the Gold Classic Collection, with Robin Hood re-issued on VHS and DVD on July 4, 2000. The DVD contained the film in its 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and was accompanied with special features including a trivia game and the cartoon short \\"Ye Olden Days\\". The remastered \\"Most Wanted Edition\\" DVD (\\"Special Edition\\" in the UK) was released on November 28, 2006 in a 16:9 matted transfer to represent its original theatrical screen ratio. It also featured a deleted scene/alternate ending of Prince John attempting to kill a wounded Robin Hood. On August 6, 2013, the film was released as the 40th Anniversary Edition on a Blu-ray combo pack. Reception =Critical reaction= Judith Crist, reviewing the film in New York magazine, said it was \\"nicely tongue-in-cheek without insult to the intelligence of either child or adult.\\" She also stated that it \\"has class ‚Äì in the fine cast that gives both voice and personality to the characters, in the bright and brisk dialogue, in its overall concept.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that it \\"should ... be a good deal of fun for toddlers whose minds have not yet shriveled into orthodoxy\\" and he called the visual style \\"charmingly conventional\\". Dave Billington of The Montreal Gazette wrote \\"As a film, Robin Hood marks a come-back of sorts for the Disney people. Ever since the old maestro died, the cartoon features have shown distressing signs of a drop in quality, both in art work and in voice characterization. But the blending of appealing cartoon animals with perfect voices for the part makes Robin Hood an excellent evening out for the whole family.\\" Also writing in the New York magazine, Ruth Gilbert called it \\"a sweet, funny, slam-bang, good- hearted Walt Disney feature cartoon with a fine cast\\" and wrote it was \\"a feast for the eyes for kiddies and Disney nostalgics.\\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the Disney \\"hallmarks are there as they ever were: the incomparably rich, full animation, the humanized animal characters perky, individual and enchanting, and the wild, inventive slapstick action.\\"Champlin, Charles (December 21, 1973). \\"Disney's 'Robin Hood' an Animated Offering\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 31. Retrieved December 1, 2018 ‚Äì via Newspapers.com. Awarding the film four stars out of five, Ian Nathan, in a retrospective review for Empire, praised the vocal performances of Peter Ustinov and Terry-Thomas acknowledging \\"while this is hardly the most dazzling of animated features, it has that cut-corner feel that seem to hold sway in the '70s (mainly because Disney were cutting corners), the characters spark to life, and the story remains as rock steady as ever.\\" Among less favorable reviews, Jay Cocks of Time gave the film a mixed verdict writing \\"Even at its best, Robin Hood is only mildly diverting. There is not a single moment of the hilarity or deep, eerie fear that the Disney people used to be able to conjure up, or of the sort of visual invention that made the early features so memorable. Robin Hoods basic problem is that it is rather too pretty and good natured.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, describing the film as \\"80 minutes of pratfalls and nincompoop dialog,\\" and criticizing the animation quality as \\"Saturday morning TV cartoon stuff.\\"Siskel, Gene (December 25, 1973). \\"Facing 'Ash Wednesday'\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 7. Retrieved December 1, 2018 ‚Äì via Newspapers.com. John Baxter of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that \\"for the most part the film is as bland and one-dimensional as the product of less sophisticated studios; and except for Peter Ustinov's plummy Prince John, the voice characterisations are as insipid as the animation is unoriginal.\\" Decades since the film's release, the film has been heavily noted for the recycled scenes of animation and the sex appeal of the two main characters. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received a 54% approval rating with an average rating of 5.4/10 based on 28 reviews. The website's consensus states that \\"One of the weaker Disney adaptations, Robin Hood is cute and colorful but lacks the majesty and excitement of the studio's earlier efforts.\\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 57 based on 9 reviews. =Box office= During its initial release, Robin Hood earned $9.6 million in rentals in the United States and Canada. It also grossed $18 million in foreign territories, which was at the time a Disney record, for a worldwide rental of $27.5 million. The film has earned a lifetime gross in the United States and Canada between $32‚Äì35 million across its two releases. Legacy The film has since become a fan favorite. Disney animator and director Byron Howard admitted that Robin Hood was his favorite film while growing up and cited it as a major influence on Zootopia. It was also one of the many inspirations for the then-emerging furry fandom. Some of the characters from the film also cameoed in the 1983 Oscar-nominated featurette short Mickey's Christmas Carol.Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983) - Connections - IMDbThe Many Character Cameos in Mickey's Christmas Carol|Oh My Disney The film was nominated for a spot on AFI's 10 Top 10 by American Film Institute in 2008 for the Animated Film list.10 Top Ten Film Genres - Animated|Filmsite The song \\"Love\\" was nominated for Best Original Song at the 46th Academy AwardsBest Robin Hood movies: Ranking 11 adaptations|EW.com but lost to \\"The Way We Were\\" from the film of the same name.1974|Oscars.org\\"The Way We Were\\" Wins Original Song: 1974 Oscars It was also featured in the 2009 feature film Fantastic Mr. Fox.

The song \\"Oo De Lally\\" is featured in a 2015 commercial for Android which shows animals of different species playing together. =Live-action adaptation= In April 2020, it was reported that Disney is developing a live-action/CG hybrid remake of Robin Hood featuring the same kind of anthropomorphic characters as in the 1973 film, with Kari Granlund writing and Carlos Lopez Estrada directing, while Justin Springer will produce the film. The remake will be released exclusively on Disney+.  Soundtrack  The music played in the background while Lady Kluck fights off Prince John's soldiers in an American football manner, following the archery tournament, is an arrangement of \\"Fight On\\" and \\"On, Wisconsin\\", the respective fight songs of the University of Southern California and the University of Wisconsin. A record of the film was made at the time of its release in 1973, which included its songs, score, narration, and dialogue. Both \\"Oo-De-Lally\\" and \\"Love\\" appear on the CD collection, Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic. \\"Love\\" is featured in the soundtrack for the 2009 film Fantastic Mr. Fox, directed by Wes Anderson. \\"Oo- De-Lally\\" is featured in the 2015 compilation album This Record Belongs To.... The full soundtrack of the film was released to the general public on August 4, 2017 as part of the Walt Disney Records: The Legacy Collection series on compact disc and digital, and was a timed exclusive to the 2017 D23 Expo. The song ‚ÄúThe Phony King of England‚Äù bears a strong resemblance to a much older, bawdy English folk song, ‚ÄúThe Bastard King of England‚Äù.

M. Barrie. Directed by Clyde Geronimi, Hamilton Luske and Wilfred Jackson, it is the 14th Disney animated feature film and was originally released on February 5, 1953 by RKO Radio Pictures. Peter Pan was the final Disney animated feature released through RKO before Walt Disney founded his own distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution, later in 1953 after the film was released (RKO was acquired by the General Tire and Rubber Company in 1959, becoming a part of the company's RKO General division). Peter Pan is also the final Disney film in which all nine members of Disney's Nine Old Men worked together as directing animators. It is also the second Disney animated film starring Kathryn Beaumont, Heather Angel, and Bill Thompson, who co-starred together in the 1951 animated feature Alice in Wonderland. The film was entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival. A sequel titled Return to Never Land was released in 2002, and a series of direct-to-DVD prequels produced by Disneytoon Studios focusing on Tinker Bell began in 2008. Plot In London, England, circa 1900, George and Mary Darling's preparations to attend a party are disrupted by the antics of their boys, John and Michael, acting out a story about Peter Pan and the pirates that was told to them by their older sister, Wendy. George, who is fed up with the stories, declares that Wendy has gotten too old to continue staying in the nursery with the boys. That night, Wendy and the boys are visited in the nursery by Peter Pan himself, who teaches them to fly with the help of his pixie friend, Tinker Bell, and takes them with him to the island of Never Land. A ship of pirates is anchored off Never Land, captained by Captain Hook with his first mate, Mr. Smee. Hook plots to take revenge upon Peter Pan for cutting off his hand, and fears the crocodile who had consumed the hand and is eager to eat the rest of him. The crew's restlessness is interrupted by the arrival of Peter and the Darlings. Tinker Bell, who is very jealous of Pan's attention to Wendy, persuades the Lost Boys that Pan has ordered them to shoot down Wendy. Tinker Bell's treachery is soon found out, and Peter banishes her. John and Michael set off with the Lost Boys to find the island's Indians, who instead capture them, believing they to be those responsible for taking the chief's daughter, Tiger Lily. Meanwhile, Peter takes Wendy to see the mermaids, who flee in terror at the sight of Hook. Peter and Wendy see that Hook and Smee have captured Tiger Lily so that they might persuade her to disclose Peter's hideout. Peter and Wendy free her and return her to the Chief, and Peter is honored by the tribe. Hook then plots to take advantage of Tinker Bell's jealousy of Wendy, tricking her into revealing the location of Peter's lair. Wendy and her brothers eventually grow homesick and plan to return home. They invite Peter and the Lost Boys to return to London and be adopted by the Darling parents. The Lost Boys agree, but Peter doesn‚Äôt want to grow up and refuses. The pirates lie in wait and capture the Lost Boys and the Darlings as they exit the lair, leaving behind a time bomb to kill Peter. Tinker Bell learns of the plot just in time to snatch the bomb from Peter as it explodes. Peter rescues Tinker Bell from the rubble and together they confront the pirates, releasing the children before they can walk the plank. Peter engages Hook in combat as the children fight off the crew. Hook and his crew flee. Peter commandeers the deserted ship and, assisted by Tinker Bell's pixie dust, flies it to London with the children aboard. However, the Lost Boys decide to return to Never Land with Peter rather than be adopted in London. George and Mary Darling return home from the party to find Wendy sleeping at the open window of the nursery. Wendy awakens and excitedly tells about their adventures. The parents look out the window and see what appears to be a pirate ship in the clouds. George, who has softened his position about Wendy staying in the nursery, recognizes the ship from his own childhood. Cast and characters * Bobby Driscoll as Peter Pan, the boy who never grows up. Like Tinker Bell, Peter can be very hot-headed. He is also commanding, but very brave. Peter can be quite mean at times (for instance, laughing at Wendy as the mermaids nastily tease her). Despite this, he is caring, especially when it comes to Tinker Bell's safety. He finds enjoyment in fighting Captain Hook and was responsible for the loss of Hook's left hand. He was modeled by Roland Dupree. * Tinker Bell: a hot-headed pixie/fairy and Peter Pan's closest friend. She is very envious of the relationship formed between Wendy and Peter, having Wendy nearly stoned to death and eventually to even tell Captain Hook of Pan's hideout after being tricked into thinking Hook's intention is to capture Wendy and not Peter. When she realizes what she has done, she tries to warn Peter of a bomb that Hook has left for him that is addressed as if from Wendy and in the form of a present. But Peter will not hear of it, and she manages to push the bomb away from him at the very moment it explodes, thus saving Peter's life while almost costing her own. When Peter searches for her desperately in the ashes, she reflects a change of attitude toward Wendy and the boys, telling Peter he must rescue them first from Captain Hook's ship. However, Peter says that he cannot leave her and tells her how much he loves her. Toward the end, Tinker Bell helps the Darling children return home by sprinkling pixie dust all across the pirate ship that Peter Pan has just inherited, which is renamed Captain Pan. Although Tinker Bell never speaks, the animators used Margaret Kerry as a model to help them draw her movements. * Kathryn Beaumont as Wendy Darling, at 12 years old the eldest of the Darling children, who adores Peter Pan. Her moody father forces her to move her out of the nursery so that she may mature. She is a very feminine character, with somewhat motherly care for others. She reminds the Lost Boys of their own mothers. She is the first of the Darling children to ask to return home. She has a soft spot for Peter and envies the attention he pays Tiger Lily, and she has reason to dislike Tinker Bell (who calls her a \\"big ugly girl\\" out of explicit jealousy) but considers her lovely. She has a very tame personality, wanting the best for everyone and grudging no one; even when the mermaids tease her nastily, she worries about the danger of their teasing more than their nastiness itself. She is naive, wise, and mature, and very trusting and faithful to her standards of conscience. * Paul Collins as John Darling, the older of the two Darling boys. He acts very sophisticated and mature for a boy eight years old. He is an analytical thinker and skilled strategist, particularly when he takes the lead over the Lost Boys while capturing Indians and fighting the pirates. He wears large, black glasses and is tall and slim. All the Darling children wear their nightgowns to Never Land, but he also takes a black top hat and an umbrella with him, showing exaggerated maturity. * Tommy Luske as Michael Darling, the youngest of the three Darling children, who is about four years old. He carries a teddy bear and is very sensitive. He is clumsy, yet very playful. * Heather Angel as Mary Darling, the Darling children's mother. She is much calmer and more understanding of her daughter's stories than her husband is, even though she takes them with a pinch of salt, saying Peter Pan is \\"the spirit of youth.\\" When her husband is overwhelmed by frustration at the children, she tries to soothe him, and later on assures the children that their father does not really mean what he says when he is angry, and that he truly loves them very much, which is true. She is a wise, lovely woman, and kind at heart. * Nana: the Darlings' nursemaid, a St. Bernard dog (originally a Newfoundland dog). She is an unnatural dog, taking care of the Darling children and cleaning up after their continuous messes. She is very efficient at her work, and possesses much tolerance for the messes. She is the family's favorite pet, so much so that separating her from the children for one night was considered a great punishment. She only barks and is musically represented by the bassoon. * Hans Conried as: **Captain Hook, a pirate captain who seeks revenge on Pan for having his left hand chopped off and fed to the Crocodile in a battle. He is a dangerous villain, though completely dependent on his personal assistant, Mr. Smee, and also very childish in his fear of the crocodile. **George Darling, the Darling children's father. He is a very moody and dramatic figure. In the beginning of the film, he is called \\"a practical man\\". He is frustrated by Wendy telling the boys imaginary tales about Peter Pan (himself already easily irritated and easy to enrage with the mere mention of Peter), and in a moment of frustration he demands that Wendy move out of the boys' room, saying she \\"has to grow up.\\" However, in a calmer moment at the end of the film, he changes his mind about Wendy's stories. He later remarks having seen a pirate ship such as Peter Pan's when he was very young himself. In contrast to his moody outbursts, he is gentle at heart; when he punishes the children by taking Nana the dog outside, he feels sorry for her and comforts her. Conried doing both characters' voices is a nod to the stage play tradition. * Bill Thompson as Mr. Smee, Hook's first mate and personal assistant. As the comic relief in the story, Mr. Smee is bossed around by Hook. The frustrated and bored crewmen (also voiced by Thompson, and several of whom are seen only in one scene in the movie) tease him into trying to convince Hook to give up the search for Peter Pan. * The Crocodile: A crocodile who swallowed an alarm clock and is after the remains of Hook. Pan had cut off Hook's hand and thrown it to the Crocodile, causing it to acquire a taste for Hook and thus follow him ever since. Its character was later known as Tick-Tock the Croc. * The Lost Boys: Pan's right-hand boys, dressed as various animals. Their names are Slightly (fox costume; voiced by Stuffy Singer), Cubby (bear costume; voiced by Robert Ellis), Nibs (rabbit costume; voiced by Jeffrey Silver), Tootles (skunk costume; never speaks) and the Twins (raccoon costumes; voiced by Johnny McGovern). Their origin remains a mystery in the movie, especially since they claim to have once had mothers of their own. They are very savage boys who get into fights easily with each other, but when they have a common goal to attain, they act as one. Tony Butala provides their singing voices. * June Foray, Connie Hilton, Karen Kester, and Margaret Kerry as the mermaids, who are Peter's friends and are very interested in his heroic stories of himself. They are resentful of Wendy and try to drown her, although Peter insists they \\"are only having fun.\\" They are frightened away when Captain Hook is rowing nearby. The mermaids appear to be in their mid- teens, with very womanly exposed bodies, resembling women in two-part bathing suits. * Candy Candido as the chief of the Indians. Despite his fierce look, he is a kind and well-meaning leader. Apparently, he has fought the Lost Boys before, having noted that both his people and the Lost Boys have won and lost several times in combat. * June Foray as the wife of the Indian chief and Tiger Lily's mother. She only appears twice in one scene, each time ordering Wendy to get firewood while everyone else celebrates Peter Pan's honor from the tribe, calling her \\"Squaw\\". * Tom Conway as the narrator, whose voice is heard only at the beginning of the film. * The Mellomen (Thurl Ravenscroft, Bill Lee, Bob Stevens and Max Smith) as the pirate chorus and the Indians. Production In 1935, Walt Disney expressed interest in doing an adaptation of Peter Pan as his second film following Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. However, the live-action film rights were held by Paramount Pictures. The copyright owner, the Hospital for Sick Children in London, unsuccessfully offered to have Disney make an agreement with Paramount. However, in January 1939, Disney obtained the animation rights to the play by outbidding Fleischer Studios, which was also developing animated feature films. By early 1939, a story reel had been completed, and by the following May, Disney had several animators in mind for the characters. Vladimir Tytla was considered for the pirates, Norman Ferguson for the dog, Nana (who also animated Pluto) and Fred Moore for Tinker Bell. During this time, Disney explored many possible interpretations of the story. In the earliest version, the film would start by telling Peter Pan's backstory. But during a story meeting on May 20, 1940, Disney said, \\"We ought to get right into the story itself, where Peter Pan comes to the house to get his shadow. That's where the story picks up. How Peter came to be is really another story.\\" Disney also explored the idea of opening the film in Never Land with Peter Pan coming to Wendy's house to kidnap her as a mother for the Lost Boys. Eventually, Disney decided that the kidnapping plot was too dark, and he went back to Barrie's original play in which Peter comes to get his shadow and Wendy is eager to see Never Land. Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the United States military took control of the studio and commissioned Walt Disney Productions to produce training and war propaganda films, so pre-production work on Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland was shelved. However, the Bank of America allowed production to continue during the war. After the war, work on the film resumed with Jack Kinney as director. At the time, Kinney had considered leaving Walt Disney Productions for the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio, but wartime restrictions prevented it. Because he did not want Kinney to get out of his contract, Disney appointed Kinney to direct Peter Pan. During this same time, Disney talked to Mary Martin, who was appearing in a stage production of the play, about voicing Peter Pan, although Roy O. Disney complained that her voice was \\"too heavy, matured, and sophisticated.\\" Jean Arthur contacted Walt about being considered for the role. Disney had also talked to Cary Grant about voicing Captain Hook, a possibility to which Grant replied that the \\"idea intrigued him.\\" Impatient with the delays, Disney asked Kinney to work on sequences consecutively rather than finishing the entire script before it was storyboarded, so that a scene would be approved at a morning story meeting and then immediately put into development. Six months later, during a storyboard meeting, Kinney presented a two-and-a-half-hour presentation, during which Disney sat silently and then stated, \\"You know, I've been thinking about Cinderella.\\" By 1947, Walt Disney Productions' financial health started to improve again. Around this time, Walt Disney acknowledged the need for sound economic policies, but emphasized to his financial backers that slashing production would be suicidal. In order to restore the studio to full financial health, Disney expressed his desire to return to producing full- length animated films. By then, three animated projects‚ÄîCinderella, Alice in Wonderland, and Peter Pan‚Äîwere in development. Disney felt the characters in Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan were too cold, but as Cinderella contained elements similar to those in Snow White, he decided to green-light Peter Pan, placing it back into production in May 1949. The scene in the nursery went through many alterations. In one version, it is Mrs. Darling who finds Peter Pan's shadow and shows it to Mr. Darling, as in the original play. In another version of the film, Nana goes to Never Land with Pan and the Darling children, the story being told through her eyes. In another interpretation of the story, John Darling is left behind for being too serious, practical and boring, but story artist Ralph Wright convinced Disney to have John go with the others to Never Land. This adaptation also included Wendy bringing her Peter Pan picture book and Peter and the children eating an \\"imaginary dinner\\". At one point, a party in Peter's hideout was conceived at which Tinker Bell becomes humiliated and, in her rage, tells Captain Hook the location of Peter Pan's hideout of her own free will. However, Disney felt that this story was contrary to Tinker Bell's character; instead, he had Captain Hook kidnapping Tinker Bell and persuading her to tell him. In Barrie's play, Captain Hook puts poison in Peter's dose of medicine and Tinker Bell saves Peter by drinking the poison herself, only to be revived by the applause of the theater audience. After much debate, Disney discarded this story development, fearing it would be difficult to achieve in a film. In earlier scripts, there were more scenes involving the pirates and mermaids that were similar to those with the dwarfs in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Ultimately, these scenes were cut for pacing reasons. The film concept was also a bit darker at one point than that of the finished product; for example, there were scenes involving Captain Hook being killed by the crocodile, the Darling family mourning over their lost children and Pan and the children discovering the pirates' treasure loaded with booby traps. =Animation= Live-action reference As with previous Disney animated features, a live-action version was filmed to serve as an aid to animators with the actors performing to a prerecorded dialogue track. Margaret Kerry received a call to audition to serve as the live-action reference for Tinker Bell. For the live- action reference, Kerry said she had to hold out her arms and pretend to fly for all the scenes requiring it. Additionally, Kerry served as reference for one of the mermaids along with Connie Hilton and June Foray. At the same time, the studio was looking for an actor to portray Peter Pan, for which Kerry suggested her dancing teacher Roland Dupree. He was interviewed and eventually won the role, providing a reference for the flying and action sequences. Bobby Driscoll also served as the live-action reference model for Peter Pan, although he was mainly used for the close-up scenes. Hans Conried completed the voice work over the course of a few days, and served as the live-action reference for two and a half years. Conried would later serve as the live- action reference for Princess Aurora‚Äôs father, King Stefan, in Sleeping Beauty (1959 film), which his voice as Stefan from the demo recording (as heard in the 2nd Disc of Disney Legacy Collection Soundtrack: Sleeping Beauty) was not used in the finalized version of the film since Taylor Holmes replaced him for the voice role. Kathryn Beaumont, who was also the voice of Wendy, also performed for the live-action reference footage. Character animation Milt Kahl wanted to animate Captain Hook but was instead assigned to animate Peter Pan and the Darling children; he claimed he was \\"outmaneuvered\\". During production, while animating Peter Pan, Kahl claimed that the hardest thing to animate was a character floating in mid-air. While observing the animation of Peter Pan, Walt Disney complained that the animators had let too many of Bobby Driscoll's facial features find their way into the character design, telling Kahl that \\"[t]hey are too masculine, too old. There is something wrong there.\\" Kahl replied, \\"You want to know what's wrong!?...What's wrong is that they don't have any talent in the place.\\" The job of animating Captain Hook was assigned to Frank Thomas, who faced conflicting visions of the character. Story artist Ed Penner viewed Hook as \\"a very foppish, not strong, dandy-type, who loved all the finery. Kind of a con man. [Co-director Gerry] Geronimi saw him as an Ernest Torrence: a mean, heavy sort of character who used his hook menacingly.\\" When Walt Disney saw Thomas' first test scenes, he said, \\"Well, that last scene has something I like I think you're beginning to get him. I think we better wait and let Frank go on a little further.\\" Because Thomas could not animate every scene of Hook, certain sequences were given to Wolfgang Reitherman, such as that showing Hook trying to escape Tick-Tock the crocodile. Ollie Johnston animated Mr. Smee. To best capture his comedic yet fear-ridden, sycophantic personality, Johnston used a variation of the Dwarf design from Snow White, and had Mr. Smee blink repeatedly. Johnston's former mentor, Fred Moore, worked in his unit as a character animator for Smee's minor scenes. Moore also animated the mermaids and the Lost Boys. On November 22, 1952, Moore and his wife were involved in an auto accident on Mount Gleason Drive in Los Angeles. Moore died of a cerebral concussion the following day at St. Joseph's Hospital, across from the Disney studios. Music Frank Churchill wrote several songs for the film during the early 1940s, and Charles Walcott wrote additional songs in 1941. When work on Peter Pan resumed in 1944, Eliot Daniel composed songs for the film. However, this version of Peter Pan was shelved so the studio could complete Cinderella. In April 1950, it was reported that Sammy Cahn and Sammy Fain were composing songs for Peter Pan. The incidental music score for the movie is composed by Oliver Wallace. =Songs= * \\"The Second Star to the Right\\" ‚Äì Words by Sammy Cahn. Music by Sammy Fain.

It was then re- released theatrically in 1958, 1969, 1976, 1982 and 1989. The film also had a special limited re-release at the Philadelphia Film Festival in 2003. It also played a limited engagement in select Cinemark Theatres from February 16‚Äì18, 2013. =Home media= Peter Pan was first released on North American VHS, LaserDisc and Betamax in 1990 and UK VHS in 1993. A THX 45th anniversary limited edition of the film was released on March 3, 1998, as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection. Peter Pan was released on DVD on November 23, 1999 as a part of the Walt Disney Limited Issues series for a limited 60-day time period before going into moratorium. Peter Pan was re-released as a special-edition VHS and DVD release in 2002 to promote the sequel Return to Never Land. The DVD was accompanied with special features including a making- of documentary, a sing-along, a storybook and a still-frame gallery of production artwork. Disney released a two-disc \\"Platinum Edition\\" DVD of the film on March 6, 2007. A Blu-ray \\"Diamond Edition\\" was released on February 5, 2013 to celebrate the movie's 60th anniversary. A DVD and digital copy of the \\"Diamond Edition\\" was also released on August 20, 2013. Peter Pan was re- released in digital HD format on May 29, 2018 and on Blu-ray on June 5, 2018, as part of the Walt Disney Signature Collection line, to celebrate the film's 65th anniversary. Reception =Box office= During its initial box office run, the film was a moderate success and it grossed $7 million in domestic rentals. The movie has earned a lifetime domestic gross of $87.4 million. Adjusted for inflation, and incorporating subsequent releases, the film has had a lifetime gross of $405,593,100. =Critical reaction= Bosley Crowther of The New York Times criticized the film's lack of faithfulness to the original play, claiming it \\"has the story but not the spirit of Peter Pan as it was plainly conceived by its author and is usually played on the stage.\\" Nevertheless, he praised the colors are \\"more exciting and the technical features of the job, such as the synchronization of voices with the animation of lips, are very good.\\" However, Time gave the film a highly favorable review, making no reference to the changes from the original play. Mae Tinee of The Chicago Tribune wrote \\"The backgrounds are delightfully picturesque, the music only so-so. The film is designed for broad effect, with the accent of comedy. I'm sure the youngsters who grow up with cartoons will be right at home with all the characters. Variety described the film as a \\"feature cartoon of enchanting quality. The music score is fine, highlighting the constant buzz of action and comedy, but the songs are less impressive than usually encountered in such a Disney presentation.\\" Harrison's Reports felt the film was \\"another Walt Disney masterpiece. It should prove a delight, not only to children, but also to every adult. The animation is so good that the characters appear almost natural.\\" Contemporary reviews remain positive. Giving the film 3¬Ω stars out of 4, Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune noted the \\"drawing of Tinkerbelle [sic] and the flamboyance of Captain Hook\\" as well as the \\"quality music mixed with appropriate animation\\" were the film's major highlights. Michael Jackson cited Peter Pan as his favorite film, and from it he derived the name of his estate, Neverland Ranch, in Santa Barbara, California, where he had a private amusement park. Ronald D. Moore, one of the executive producers of the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica, has cited this film as the inspiration for the series' theme of the cyclical nature of time, using the film's opening line, \\"All of this has happened before and it will all happen again,\\" as a key tenet of the culture's scripture. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported the film received an approval rating of 81% based on 36 reviews, with an average score of 7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Though it doesn't delve deeply into the darkness of J.M. Barrie's tale, Peter Pan is a heartwarming, exuberant film with some great tunes.\\". =Controversy= Peter Pan has been criticized in recent decades for its broadly stereotypical treatment of the Indians. In the song \\"What Made the Red Man Red?\\", the Native Americans were called \\"Indians\\" and are depicted as a race mainly defined by sexuality; the lyrics attribute the Indians' red skin to their constant pursuit of women. Marc Davis, one of the supervising animators of the film, said in an interview years after the production that \\"I'm not sure we would have done the Indians if we were making this movie now. And if we had we wouldn't do them the way we did back then.\\" The Native Americans were not included in the 2002 sequel Return to Never Land, but they were included in a tie-in video game. Legacy =Disney Fairies= Disney Fairies is a series of children's books published by Random House, which features Tinker Bell and her friends. It also has a film series starting in 2008 with the self-titled film about Tinker Bell. =Theme parks= Cast Member as Peter Pan in Disneyland Paris. Peter Pan‚Äôs Flight is a popular ride found at Disneyland, Walt Disney World, Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Paris, and Shanghai Disneyland. Peter Pan, Wendy, Captain Hook and Mr. Smee make appearances in the parades, as well as greetings throughout the theme parks. * Peter Pan, Wendy, Captain Hook, Mr. Smee, and the Pirates were featured in a scene during Disneyland's original version of Fantasmic! from 1992‚Äì2016. =Ice shows= * Disney on Ice began its touring production of Peter Pan in Fall 1989. The production went on to tour nationally & internationally, from 1989 ‚Äì 1993. The production featured a pre-recorded soundtrack with all the film's songs and character voices. * A shortened version of the story is presented in the current Disney on Ice production Mickey & Minnie's Amazing Journey. The show began in Fall 2003 & is currently on tour nationally. It features the songs \\"You Can Fly!\\", \\"Following the Leader\\", \\"Your Mother and Mine\\", \\"A Pirate's Life\\", \\"The Elegant Captain Hook\\" & \\"The Second Star to the Right\\". =Video games= Peter Pan: Adventures in Never Land Neverland is a playable world in both Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, with Tinker Bell appearing as a summon. Peter Pan appears as a summon in the sequel, Kingdom Hearts II. Neverland also appears as a playable world in Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days and returns as a playable world in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. =Board game= Walt Disney's Peter Pan: A Game of Adventure (1953) is a Transogram Company Inc. track board game based upon the film. The game was one of many toys that exploited the popularity of Walt Disney's post-World War II movies.Rich, Mark. Warman's 101 Greatest Baby Boomer Toys. kp books, 2005. p. 72. The object of the game is to be the first player to travel from the Darlings' house to Neverland and back to the Darlings' house. Play begins at the Darlings' house in the upper left hand corner of the game board. Each player moves, in turn, the number of spaces along the track indicated by his spin of the dial. When a player reaches the Never Isle, he selects a character from the film (Peter, Wendy, Michael, or John) and receives the instruction card for that character. The player follows his chosen character's track on the board, obeying instructions upon the character's card. The player is also obligated to follow any instructions on those spaces he lands upon after spinning the dial during the course of his turn at play. The first player who travels from Never Land to Skull Rock and along the Stardust Trail to Captain Hook's ship, and returns to the Darlings' house is declared the winner. The board game makes an appearance in the 1968 version of Yours, Mine and Ours as a Christmas present. =Musical= Disney's Peter Pan Jr is a one-hour children's musical based on the Disney Peter Pan movie with some updated material. It became available for school and children's theatre productions in 2013 after several pilot productions.Disney's Peter Pan JR., Music Theatre International (MTI), accessed June 26, 2017 =Sequels= This was Disney's first Peter Pan film. In the early 2000s, a Peter Pan franchise was spawned, involving a number of other animated releases. The franchise also included: * Peter Pan: Return to Never Land: Released theatrically in 2002, and a direct-sequel to Peter Pan. * The Tinker Bell film series: A spin-off and prequel to the Peter Pan films. Disneytoon Studios produced a number of Tinker Bell films, including six feature-length straight-to-home video films, and two shorts. * The television series Jake and the Never Land Pirates includes Hook and Smee as main characters, and is set in Never Land, years after the events of the feature films. =Live-action adaptation= On April 13, 2016, following the individual financial and critical successes of Maleficent, Cinderella, and The Jungle Book, a number of live-action adaptations of Walt Disney Pictures' classic animated films were announced to be in development. The Walt Disney Company announced that a live action Peter Pan film was in development, with David Lowery serving as director, with a script he co-wrote with Toby Halbrooks. On July 31, 2018, it was reported that the feature length film would be released exclusively on the company's streaming service, Disney+. It has since been said that the film might instead get a theatrical release. On January 7, 2020, casting was underway while the film was retitled Peter Pan and Wendy. Joe Roth and Jim Whitaker will serve as producers. Principal photography was originally scheduled to begin on April 17, 2020, in Canada and in London, United Kingdom. On March 10, 2020, Variety reported that Alexander Molony and Ever Anderson were cast as Peter Pan and Wendy, respectively. On March 13, production on the film was temporarily halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production is now expected to begin in March 2021. On July 7, 2020, Variety reported that Jude Law is in talks to play Captain Hook and his casting was officially confirmed two months later. Joaquin Phoenix, Adam Driver, and Will Smith were previously considered to play Hook, but they all turned down the role. In September 2020, Yara Shahidi was cast as Tinker Bell.

Notes and Inscriptions from Pisidia, Part 1, page 74, by G. E. Bean Modern scholars locate Baris near Kƒ±lƒ±√ß, in Ke√ßiborlu district, Isparta province. At an early stage it became a Christian bishopric, a suffragan of the Metropolitan see of Antioch of Pisidia, the capital of the province. The names of two of its bishops are known with certainty: Heraclius participated in the First Council of Nicaea in 325 and Leo in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787. In addition, Paulus was at the Council of Constantinople (869) and Stephanus was at the Council of Constantinople (879), but one or both of these may have been of the Baris in the Roman province of Hellespontus.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 1049‚Äì1050Raymond Janin, v. 2.

Sights  The city lies close to a fault line and is thus prone to violent earthquakes. Some historical buildings and houses remain from the 19th century, but are rare compared to the number of modern buildings. There are several important mosques in Isparta, including the pre-Ottoman Hƒ±zƒ±r Bey Mosque (c. 1325), the Kutlubey or Ulu (Grand) Mosque (1429, with major restorations made in the 19th century) and Hacƒ± Abdi Mosque (1569). The city boasts a mosque by the Ottoman royal architect Mimar Sinan ‚Äî the 16th century's Firdevs Pasa mosque. It is also known as Mimar Sinan Mosque. There are several remains of Greek Orthodox churches from the Byzantine and Ottoman periods (14th‚Äì19th century). The Byzantine fortress is mostly in ruins.

Economy  The main economic activities of Isparta are the production of rosewater and handmade carpets. Tourism, both local and increasingly international due to \\"biblical tourism\\", is becoming an important source of revenue. In the early 20th century, carpetmaking was a major industry in Isparta.  Climate  Isparta has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Csa) with continental influences. Winters are cool and rainy and often snowy, summers are hot and dry. The lakes around the city have an important moderating influence on the climate. Precipitation occurs mostly in January and December. Monthly rainy days decrease until August. Rainy days increase again with September.

Fred Turner (April 17, 1922 ‚Äì November 23, 2003) was an American attorney. He successfully defended Clarence Earl Gideon in his retrial after the 1963 Supreme Court case of Gideon v. Wainwright overturned his first conviction. The story behind this case was told in Anthony Lewis's 1964 book Gideon's Trumpet. There was also a 1980 made-for-TV film called Gideon's Trumpet in which Lane Smith played Turner and Henry Fonda played Gideon. Turner was born in Millville, Florida, now part of Panama City. He joined the Army Air Corps, the precursor to the present-day Air Force, after high school and was a supply officer in the 308th Bombardment Group during World War II. He rose to the rank of captain before leaving for the University of Florida in Gainesville. After graduating in 1948, he returned to Bay County to practice law.  Gideon's case  Clarence Earl Gideon was a drifter convicted of petty theft from a pool hall; at the trial he was denied a lawyer. His appeal to the Supreme Court was accepted, and the decision ordered that counsel be provided in all criminal cases. Gideon's conviction was not overturned, but he was to be tried again. Gideon chose Turner to be his lawyer for his second trial. The retrial took place on August 5, 1963, five months after the Supreme Court ruling. By destroying the credibility of the prosecution's key witness through exposing contradictions with other eyewitnesses and the witness's self- admittedly false statements (such as about his prior criminal record), Turner won an acquittal for Gideon. The jury acquitted Gideon after one hour of deliberation.  After Gideon  Turner worked as a private attorney until 1979, when he was appointed and subsequently elected to a circuit judge seat. At age 70, he retired from the bench in 1991. His wife Helen died in 1997. Turner died in 2003 at age 81 at his home in Panama City. He was survived by three children and three grandchildren.

Along with Route 9 and U.S. Route 20 to the south, these highways are the main alternatives to the Massachusetts Turnpike/I-90 toll highway. Route 2 runs the entire length of the northern tier of Massachusetts, beginning at the New York border, where it connects with New York State Route 2, and ending near Boston Common in Boston. Most of the route is a freeway through central Massachusetts, with the longest non-freeway portions being the western and eastern ends. Portions of Route 2 follow the Mohawk Trail, while older alignments are known as Route 2A. Route description Route 2 proceeds east from the New York state line on a winding, scenic path in Berkshire County through Williamstown, where it serves the Williams College area and through North Adams, where it serves the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts. East of North Adams, Route 2 ascends via a hairpin turn into the Hoosac Range along what is known as the Mohawk Trail. Route 2 then enters Franklin County, meeting Interstate 91 at an interchange in Greenfield and briefly runs concurrently with I-91. While the old Route 2 becomes Route 2A and goes through downtown Greenfield, Route 2 exits off I-91 as a short expressway before becoming a two-lane freeway. Outside Greenfield, Route 2A temporarily ends and merges with Route 2\\\\. Route 2 remains a regular two-lane surface road in Gill and through Erving, though it has some grade-separated interchanges in Millers Falls at its intersection with Route 63. There is another gap in the two-lane expressway in the Erving area. Recently, the road in Erving was routed to the north and straightened to avoid the paper mill next to the river. This rerouting led to the road being shortened by less than a tenth of a mile. Once the road enters the Town of Orange, Route 2A resumes and diverges from Route 2. At this point, Route 2 again becomes a two-lane expressway. In Orange, Route 2 runs concurrently with U.S. Route 202. The road at this point enters the town of Athol in Worcester County. After its eastern interchange in Phillipston when US-202 departs to the north, Route 2 becomes a full four-lane expressway, though not to Interstate standards at most points. It continues through Gardner into Fitchburg where Route 2 has several at-grade intersections with Oak Hill Rd, Palmer Rd, Mt. Elam Rd and Abbott Ave. At the intersection with Mt. Elam Rd, a traffic light remains in use on the eastbound side. Continuing east into Leominster, Interstate 190 splits off, heading south to Worcester. Route 2 continues east to Middlesex County and enters Boston's outer loop at the interchange with Interstate 495 in Littleton. It continues as an expressway into Acton, where the expressway ends at the traffic light intersection with Piper Rd and Taylor Rd, and Route 2 becomes a regular divided highway at most points and just a four-lane highway at other points. At the Concord Rotary, a major traffic choke point, Route 2 intersects with Route 2A and the eastern terminus of Route 119 (which is concurrent with Route 2A). After the rotary, the road loses its dividing wall as it passes by the State Police (who have an emergency-only traffic light) and over the Assabet River. Route 2A formerly broke away from Route 2 at the next traffic light to go left into Concord but is now overlaid with Route 2\\\\. At Crosby's Corner, the sixth intersection after the rotary, Route 2A exits under the highway while Route 2 veers right (but still heads east). While the highway is divided across Lincoln, there is a single traffic light intersection at Bedford Rd.Alewife. At this point, Route 2 enters Lexington and still is a divided four-lane road with surface intersections. It then heads to Boston's inner belt, crossing Interstate 95/Route 128. In Arlington, Route 2 is a six-lane and then eight-lane limited- access highway until east of Exit 60 (Lake St), where it narrows with little warning to six lanes and then to four lanes. This section of expressway actually meets the standards of an interstate highway. The final off-ramp leads toward the large parking garage at the MBTA Alewife Station. At this point the road heads into Cambridge. The shield for Massachusetts Route 2, located across from the Boston Common The limited access highway portion ends at a signalled intersection, where it merges with U.S. Route 3 south and Route 16 west in Cambridge and continues as a four-lane surface road to the Boston Public Garden. Route 2 follows Alewife Brook Parkway, Concord Ave, Fresh Pond Parkway, Gerry's Landing Rd, and Memorial Drive (all parkways maintained by the Department of Conservation and Recreation) through Cambridge. It crosses into Boston heading southward on the Boston University Bridge. It winds through the Boston University campus as Mountfort Street and crosses over both the Massachusetts Turnpike and Commonwealth Avenue before heading due east towards Kenmore Square, while running parallel to U.S. Route 20. Immediately east of the Boston University campus, it crosses into Kenmore Square, which is also the eastern terminus of U.S. Route 20. From Kenmore Sq, Route 2 follows Commonwealth Ave to Arlington St. It circles the Public Garden, using Arlington St to Boylston St to Charles S. Route 2 goes along northbound Route 28 at the intersection of Charles St and Beacon St between Boston Common and the Public Garden. Shortly after, Route 2 ends on U.S. 3 or Route 3 while Route 28 north joins with the southbound of Route 3\\\\. History The route amalgamates and supersedes various named highways in some cases going back to the pre-automobile era. For example, parts of Route 2 are sometimes known as the Cambridge and Concord Turnpike and the Mohawk Trail. right In the early 1920s, Route 2 was known as New England Interstate Route 7 (NE-7), a major road connecting Boston with Troy, New York. NE-7 ran roughly where Route 2A (the original surface alignment of Route 2) does now except near the New York state line. NE-7 used current Massachusetts Route 43, New York State Route 43 and New York State Route 66 to reach Troy. Current Route 2 from Williamstown to Petersburgh was previously numbered as Route 96. Route 2 connected as a highway in its current right-of-way at Alewife Brook Parkway at some point before 1937.http://www.schlichtman.org/mahighways/bosmap37.gif An upgraded Route 2 was originally planned to continue as Boston's Northwest Expressway (merging with a re-routed U.S. Route 3 at the Arlington-Lexington or Arlington-Cambridge border) to a junction with Interstate 695, the Inner Beltway, but this, along with the Inner Beltway itself, was cancelled in 1970, accounting for the abrupt narrowing at Alewife. In place of the highway project, the MBTA Red Line was extended from Harvard to Alewife in the 1980s. The Leominster to Ayer section opened on July 3, 1953, completing the expressway portion from Westminster to West Concord. Full grade separation between Route 128 and Alewife Brook Parkway was completed around 1970. =Crosby's Corner intersection= This major project has been planned since 1999. The intersection had an average of 90 accidents a year. The project was intended to solve the traffic and safety problems that had long occurred at the Crosby's Corner intersection (junction of Route 2 and 2A) in Concord. The project, which was expected to cost $71.9 million, widened Route 2 from Bedford Rd in Lincoln to 300 feet west of Sandy Pond Rd in Concord. The project eliminated the at grade intersection, realigned Route 2, and constructed new entrance and exit ramps along with new service roads next to Route 2. The full project included building a new overpass bridge over Route 2 and building multiple service roads next to Route 2. Work also consisted of a new signalized intersection. The project was put out to bid for contractors on September 19, 2011. A contractor was expected to be chosen over the winter and construction was expected to begin in Spring 2012 on the estimated $55 million project. The Army Corps of Engineers published a noticehttp://www.nae.usace.army.mil/reg/09/2009-01425.pdf for this project, because of its impact on wetlands at Crosby's Corner. During the summer of 2012, activity on this portion of Route 2 included surveying and the installation of orange-painted stakes. Signs were added in January 2013 indicating that construction would start on January 14. As of April 2014 the project was underway and predicted completion was Spring 2016. The project was completed in 2016, with a large improvement in traffic flow. Future =Concord rotary= A project to improve the Concord Rotary, at the convergence of Route 2, Route 2A/119 (Elm Street), Barrett's Mill Road and Commonwealth Avenue, has been in planning since 2003 or even earlier. More than 61,000 cars use this rotary on a typical day, and the backed up traffic can be significant. The improved intersection would include overpasses for local streets, while Route 2 traffic would continue unimpeded at grade. However, the project was removed from the funded portion of the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization's (MPO) Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP) in August 2009 and is currently on hold.

It is about a street dog named Rover, who is owned by a Las Vegas showgirl. Rover gets dumped off Hoover Dam by the showgirl's boyfriend. However, rather than drowning, Rover ends up on a farm. Plot Rover is a Basset Hound that lives a life of luxury in Las Vegas with his owner Connie, a showgirl. He gambles and flirts with girls with his best friend Eddie. One night, he sees Connie's boyfriend, Rocky, in a transaction with a pair of gangsters, and accidentally disrupts it. Thinking that Rocky is an undercover cop setting them up, the gangsters flee, telling Rocky that he has blown his last chance. The next day, Connie goes on tour for two weeks, leaving Rocky to look after Rover. In retaliation for ruining his deal, Rocky stuffs Rover in a bag, drives him to Hoover Dam and throws him into the water. The bag is later pulled out of the water by two passing fishermen, who take Rover back to shore and place him in the back of their pickup truck. Rover regains consciousness and jumps out of the truck when the fishermen stop for gas, and begins to wander down the road. He ends up in the countryside, and eventually runs into a farmer, Cal, and his son, Danny, who convinces his father to take the dog in. Cal agrees on one condition: at the first sign of trouble, he'll be sent to an animal shelter, and if nobody claims him, the animal shelter can put him down. Rover has difficulty adjusting to life on the farm, but with the help of Daisy, a beautiful collie next door, and the other dogs on the farm, he succeeds in earning their trust. Rover spends Christmas with the family, and begins to fall in love with Daisy, who returns his affections. However, one night, a pack of wolves attempt to kill a turkey on the farm. As Rover attempts to save the turkey, the wolves run off, but the bird ends up dead and Cal mistakenly believes Rover to have been responsible. The next morning, Cal takes Rover into the woods and is about to shoot him, but is attacked by the wolves. Rover manages to chase off the wolves, and rallies the other farm dogs to get the injured Cal home. Rover's heroics make the papers, allowing Eddie and Connie to find out where he is. Danny informs Rover of his trip back to Las Vegas and he departs the farm. Although initially happy to be reunited with Connie and his friends, Rover soon begins to miss his life on the farm. When Rocky comes into Connie's dressing room, and upon seeing him, Rover initiates revenge. After Rocky accidentally confesses to what he did, Connie angrily breaks up with him. Infuriated, Rocky tries to retaliate against Connie, but Rover and his dog friends chase him out of the casino, where he runs into a limo filled with the gangsters. At first, Rocky is happy to see them, but then questions their presence in the first place. One of the gangsters proudly reveals that they set him up and are going to throw him over the Hoover Dam, much to Rover's delight as he watches the limo drive off with a horrified Rocky. Sometime later, Rover, missing Daisy, becomes depressed. Connie, realizing he has met someone, takes Rover back to the farm to stay. Rover is reunited with Daisy, who reveals to him that he is now a father, unveiling six puppies. The story ends with Rover teaching his kids how to play cards, and playfully chasing Daisy around the farmyard.

It was originally planned as an R-rated animated film, in the vein of Ralph Bakshi's films, but Warner Bros. wanted the film's content to be toned down to a G-rating. Cartoonist Jeff Smith, best known as the creator of the self-published comic book series Bone, described working on key frames for the film's animation to editor Gary Groth in The Comics Journal in 1994. The technique had already been used in Hyperion¬¥s previous film The Brave Little Toaster, Disney's The Black Cauldron, The Great Mouse Detective, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Oliver & Company, The Little Mermaid, DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp and The Rescuers Down Under. Reception Entertainment Weekly graded the film a 'C', questioning Dangerfield's decision to make the film and said, 'Dangerfield should have known he had written a no-win scenario. His strongest suit ‚Äî that gleeful lounge-act vulgarity ‚Äî has always been a little too crass for kids. Yet when Rover offers gooey, sentimental life lessons, it feels unconvincing, like a rock star in a suit. This mongrel-movie badly wants to be a kidvid hit, and with that star and decent animation chops, it stands a chance. But don't bet the farm on it.' TV Guide awarded the film two stars, criticizing the tone and inconsistent animation, and said, 'The result is a confused hybrid creation, suspended in a twilight zone between Don Bluth's benign but dull children's fare and Ralph Bakshi's gratingly hip work.' Home video The film was released on VHS and LaserDisc on February 12, 1992. Warner Archive later released the film on DVD on December 7, 2010.

It depicts a female nude and a scantily dressed female bather on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. Rejected by the Salon jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit this and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refus√©s,Catalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, gravure, lithographie et architecture : refus√©s par le Jury de 1863 et expos√©s, par d√©cision de S.M. l'Empereur au salon annexe, palais des Champs-Elys√©es, le 15 mai 1863, √âdouard Manet, Le Bain, no. 363, Biblioth√®que nationale de France where the painting sparked public notoriety and controversy. The work is now in the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris.Mus√©e d'Orsay, Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe (Luncheon on the Grass) A smaller, earlier version can be seen at the Courtauld Gallery, London.The Courtauld Gallery version √âdouard Manet - D√©jeuner sur l'herbe (Courtauld) Description and context The painting features a nude woman casually lunching with two fully dressed men. Her body is starkly lit and she stares directly at the viewer. The two men, dressed as young dandies, seem to be engaged in conversation, ignoring the woman. In front of them, the woman's clothes, a basket of fruit, and a round loaf of bread are displayed, as in a still life. In the background, a lightly clad woman bathes in a stream. Too large in comparison with the figures in the foreground, she seems to float above them. The roughly painted background lacks depth, giving the viewer the impression that the scene is not taking place outdoors, but in a studio. This impression is reinforced by the use of broad \\"studio\\" light, which casts almost no shadows. The man on the right wears a flat hat with a tassel, a kind normally worn indoors. Despite the mundane subject, Manet deliberately chose a large canvas size, measuring 81.9 √ó 104.1 in (208 by 264.5 cm), normally reserved for historical, religious and mythological subjects. The style of the painting breaks with the academic traditions of the time. He did not try to hide the brush strokes; the painting even looks unfinished in some parts of the scene. The nude is also starkly different from the smooth, flawless figures of Cabanel or Ingres. A nude woman casually lunching with fully dressed men was an affront to audiences' sense of propriety, though √âmile Zola, a contemporary of Manet's, argued that this was not uncommon in paintings found in the Louvre. Zola also felt that such a reaction came from viewing art differently than \\"analytic\\" painters like Manet, who use a painting's subject as a pretext to paint. There is much not known about the painting, such as when Manet actually began painting it, how he got the idea and how and what sort of preparatory works he did. Though Manet had claimed this piece was once valued at 25,000 Francs in 1871, it actually remained in his possession until 1878 when Jean-Baptiste Faure, opera-singer and collector, bought it for just 2,600 Francs. Figures in the painting The figures of this painting are a testament to how deeply connected Manet was to Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe. Some assume that the landscape of the painting is meant to be l'√éle Saint-Ouen, which was just up the Seine from his family property in Gennevilliers. Manet often used real models and people he knew as reference during his creation process. The female nude is thought to be Victorine Meurent, the woman who became his favorite and frequently portrayed model, who later was the subject of Olympia. The male figure on the right was based on a combination of his two brothers, Eug√®ne and Gustave Manet. The other man is based on his brother-in-law, Dutch sculptor Ferdinand Leenhoff. Nancy Locke referred to this scene as Manet's family portrait. Interactions of the figures What many critics find shocking about this painting is the interaction, or lack thereof, between the three main subjects in the foreground and the woman bathing in the background. There are many contrasting qualities to the painting that juxtapose and distance the female nude from the other two male subjects. For example, the feminine versus the masculine, the naked versus the clothed, and the white color palette versus the dark color palette creates a clear social difference between the men and the woman. Additionally, some viewers are intrigued by the questions raised by the gaze of the nude woman. It is indeterminable whether she is challenging or accepting the viewer, looking past the viewer, engaging the viewer, or even looking at the viewer at all. This encounter identifies the gaze as a figure of the painting itself, as well as the figure object of the woman's gaze. Inspirations As with the later Olympia (1863) and other works, Manet's composition reveals his study of the old masters, as the disposition of the main figures is derived from Marcantonio Raimondi's engraving The Judgment of Paris (c. 1515) after a drawing by Raphael.Ross King. The Judgement of Paris: The Revolutionary Decade that Gave the World Impressionism. New York: Waller & Company, 2006 . Raphael was an artist revered by the conservative members of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts and his paintings were part of the teaching programme at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, where copies of fifty-two images from his most celebrated frescoes were permanently on display. Le Bain (an early title for Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe) was therefore, in many ways, a defiant painting. Manet was cheekily reworking Raphael, turning a mythological scene from one of the most celebrated engravings of the Renaissance into a tableau of somewhat vulgar Parisian holidaymakers.Ross King, p. 41. File:Urteil des Paris.jpg|Judgement of Paris Engraving (ca. 1515) by Marcantonio Raimondi to a design by Raphael File:Fiesta campestre.jpg|The Pastoral Concert (ca. 1510) by Giorgione or Titian, Louvre, Paris, cited as an inspiration for Manet's painting File:Giorgione, The tempest.jpg|Giorgione, The Tempest (c. 1508), Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice, Italy File:Antoine Watteau - La Partie carr√©e.jpg|Antoine Watteau, La Partie Carr√©e, (c. 1713) Scholars also cite two works as important precedents for Manet's painting Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe: The Pastoral Concert by Giorgione or possibly Titian (in the Louvre) and Giorgione's The Tempest, both of which are famous Renaissance paintings. The Tempest, which also features a fully dressed man and a nude woman in a rural setting, offers an important precedent for Manet's painting Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe.John Rewald,The History of Impressionism, The Museum of Modern Art, 4th revised edition 1973, (1st 1946, 2nd 1955, 3rd 1961), p. 85. . Pastoral Concert even more closely resembles Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe, as it features two dressed men seated in a rural setting, with two undressed women. Pastoral Concert is in the collection of the Louvre in Paris and is likely, therefore, to have been studied by Manet. According to Proust, he and Manet had been lounging by the Seine as they spotted a woman bathing in the river. This prompted Manet to say, \\"I copied Giorgione's women, the women with musicians. It's black that painting. The ground has come through. I want to redo it and do it with a transparent atmosphere with people like those we see over there.\\" There may be a connection between Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe and the work of Jean Antoine Watteau. Manet's original title, Le Bain, initially drew the main attention to the woman near the water. This bathing figure alone is quite similar to the figure in Watteau's La Villageoise, as both women crouch or lean over near water, simultaneously holding up their skirts. It is possible that Manet adapted this pose, which is more clearly seen in a sketch of his years before his creation of Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe. Criticism There were many mixed reviews and responses to Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe when it was first displayedFernand Desnoyers, La peinture en 1863 : Salon des refus√©s, A. Dutil (Paris) 1863, Biblioth√®que nationale de France (in French) and it continues to yield a variety of responses. The initial response was characterized by its blunt rejection from the Paris Salon and subsequent display in the Salon des Refus√©s. Though many critiques were rooted in confusion about the piece, they were not always completely negative. * Odilon Redon, for example, did not like it. There is a discussion of it, from this point of view, in Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. * Le Capitaine Pompilius, a contributor for Le Petit Journal, thought the characteristically \\"male\\" colors of the piece brought the countryside into the salon, but thought the painting was underdeveloped. * Castagnary, appreciator of realist works, identified it as a nice sketch but said it lacked sincerity and lost the definition of the anatomy of the subjects. He also described Manet's painting technique as \\"flabby\\". * Arthur Stevens, contributor for Le Figaro, praised Manet as a talented colorist but felt that he neglected form and modeling in this piece. * Thor√©, Paul, and Louvet loved the energy of the colors but found the brush strokes to be uneven. One interpretation of the work is that it depicts the rampant prostitution present at that time in the Bois de Boulogne, a large park on the western outskirts of Paris. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting.Peter J. Gartner, Art and Architecture: Mus√©e d'Orsay, 2001, p. 180. . Indeed, the Bois de Boulogne is to this day known as a pick-up place for prostitutes and illicit sexual activity after dark, just as it had been in the 19th century. = Criticism of the subject matter = * Louis √âtienne characterized the painting as a puzzle, while describing the nude female as \\"a Br√©da of some sort, as nude as possible, lolling boldly between two swells dressed to the teeth. These two persons look like high school students on holiday, committing a great sin to prove their manhood.\\"Louis √âtienne, Le jury et les exposants: salon des refus√©s, Paris, 1863, p. 30., Biblioth√®que nationale de France * Arthur Stevens could not understand what the painting was saying. * Didier de Montchaux found the subject to be \\"fairly scabrous\\". * Thor√© described the nude as an ugly and risqu√© subject matter, while describing the male on the right as one \\"who doesn't even think of taking off his horrible padded hat outdoors ... It's the contrast between such an antipathetic animal to the character of a pastoral scene, and this undraped bather, that is shocking.\\" * Philip Hamerton, an English painter and contributor at the Fine Arts Quarterly, had an affinity for the characteristic photographic detail of the Pre-Raphaelite paintings. Though he did recognize the inspiration from Giorgione, he found Manet's modern realism to be offensive in this situation. His disapproval of Manet and similar artists was related to the idea of indecency behind \\"vulgar men\\" painting nude women. = General response = Though the peculiarity of the combination of one female nude with three clothed figures sparked mixed responses, the lack of interaction of the figures in addition to the lack of engagement by the nude woman provoked laughter instead of offense. Laughter as a response represses the sexual tension and makes the scene rather unthreatening to the viewer in the end. Commentary of √âmile Zola > The Luncheon on the Grass is the greatest work of √âdouard Manet, one in > which he realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural > grandeur in a landscape.

But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized. > The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging The Luncheon on the Grass > like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some > people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that > the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, > while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a > straightforward audience. Painters, especially √âdouard Manet, who is an > analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which > torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to > paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists.

Inspired works James Tissot, La Partie Carr√©e, 1870 * In L'Oeuvre, √âmile Zola's novel about a painter, a work by his main character, Claude Lantier, exhibited in a fictional salon des refus√©s, resembles Manet's painting. * Claude Monet's own version of Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe from 1865‚Äì1866, was inspired by Manet's painting. * French painter James Tissot, painted La Partie Carr√©e, in 1870; arguably a tamer version without the nudity of Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe. * Paul C√©zanne painted the same theme in his Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe (1876‚Äì1877), Mus√©e de l'Orangerie, Paris. It is not certain, however, that C√©zanne was responsible for the title of the work, but it does incorporate many of the same elements of subject in the piece. For example, C√©zanne's clothed female subject poses similarly to the model of Manet in which her chin rests in her hand. The male figure, meant to resemble the painter himself, mimics the hand gesture of the man furthest right in Manet's piece. The composition of C√©zanne's painting also bears resemblance to Bacchanal (between 1627 and 1628), by Nicolas Poussin, whose works in the Louvre were periodically copied by C√©zanne. It is possible that C√©zanne's D√©jeuner represents nothing more than the joyful memories of outings in the countryside around Aix-en-Provence, known especially from the testimony of a childhood friend of the painter, √âmile Zola.Paul C√©zanne, Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe (1876‚Äì1877), Mus√©e de l'Orangerie, Paris Claude Monet, Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe, 1865‚Äì1866, Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris * Manet's painting inspired Picasso as he completed the largest concentration of art prompted by a single work during the 20th century, consisting of 27 paintings, 140 drawings, 3 linogravures and cardboard marquettes for sculpture carried out between 1949 and 1962.Picasso: Challenging the past National Gallery exhibition book, p. 116. Picasso also adopted some of Manet's techniques involving exploitation of the nude in the foreground as evident in his work Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, 1907. * Paul Gauguin may have been inspired by this piece in creating his 1896 work Where do we come from? Who are we? Where are we going?, as there is a similarity of Manet's depiction of the nude woman and Gauguin's Tahitian woman. * Max Ernst painted a parody version of this piece named Le D√©jeuner sur l'Herbre in 1944. He inverts the painting, replaces the nude woman with a fish, and adds an 'r' to the title for comedic effect. * The painting inspired the 1959 film of the same name by Jean Renoir. * Alain Jacquet copied in 1964 the composition of Manet in his D√©jeuner sur l'herbe:, a serie of 95 serigraphies portraying the art critic Pierre Restany and the painter Mario Schifano, one of which was left in the lobby of the hotel Chelsea in New York City for payment of his room. * It was copied in the cover photo of the Bow Wow Wow LP See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang Yeah, City All Over! Go Ape Crazy!, and the EP The Last of the Mohicans. Controversy arose because the naked girl (lead singer Annabella Lwin) was only 14 at the time.

Brownfield, Me.: Fox Maple Press. p. 9. . It is considered more environmentally friendly than other types of foundation because cement manufacturing requires the use of enormous amounts of energy. However, some soil environments are not suitable for this kind of foundation; particularly expansive or poor load-bearing (< 1 ton/sf) soils.Kennedy, Joseph F. (2002) The art of natural building: design, construction, resources. Gabriola Island, BC: New Society Publishers. p. 111. . A rubble trench foundation with a concrete grade beam is not recommended for earthquake prone areas.Chiras, Daniel D. (2004). The new ecological home: the complete guide to green building options. White River Junction, Vt.: Chelsea Green Pub. Co. p. 75. . A foundation must bear the structural loads imposed upon it and allow proper drainage of ground water to prevent expansion or weakening of soils and frost heaving. While the far more common concrete foundation requires separate measures to ensure good soil drainage, the rubble trench foundation serves both foundation functions at once. To construct a rubble trench foundation a narrow trench is dug down below the frost line. The bottom of the trench would ideally be gently sloped to an outlet. Drainage tile, graded 1\\":8' to daylight, is then placed at the bottom of the trench in a bed of washed stone protected by filter fabric. The trench is then filled with either screened stone (typically 1-1/2\\") or recycled rubble. A steel- reinforced concrete grade beam may be poured at the surface to provide ground clearance for the structure. If an insulated slab is to be poured inside the grade beam, then the outer surface of the grade beam and the rubble trench should be insulated with rigid XPS foam board, which must be protected above grade from mechanical and UV degradation. The rubble-trench foundation is a relatively simple, inexpensive, and environment-friendly alternative to a conventional foundation, but may require an engineer's approval if building officials are not familiar with it. Frank Lloyd Wright used them successfully for more than 50 years in the first half of the 20th century, and there is a revival of this style of foundation with the increased interest in green building.

The book is now widely considered to be a classic Christmas story for young children. It was praised for its detailed illustrations and calm, relaxing storyline. For the work, Van Allsburg won the annual Caldecott Medal for illustration of an American children's picture book in 1986, his second. The book is set partially in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the author's home town, and was inspired in part by Van Allsburg's memories of visiting the Herpolsheimer's and Wurzburg's department stores as a child. It was adapted as an Oscar-nominated motion- capture film in 2004 starring Tom Hanks and directed by Robert Zemeckis with Van Allsburg serving as an executive producer on the film. Plot summary A young boy is awakened on Christmas Eve night by the sound of a train. To his astonishment, he finds the train is waiting for him. He sees a conductor who then proceeds to look up at his window. He runs downstairs and goes outside. The conductor explains the train is called the Polar Express, and is journeying to the North Pole. The boy then boards the train, which is filled with many other children in their pajamas. The Polar Express races north over mountains and through boreal forests inhabited by timber wolves as well as rabbits, but the train never slows down. When it arrives at the North Pole, the conductor explains that Santa will select one of them to receive the first gift of Christmas. The boy and the other children see thousands of Christmas elves gathered at the center of town waiting to send Santa Claus on his way. The boy is handpicked by Santa to receive the first gift of Christmas. Realizing that he could choose anything in the world, the boy asks for a bell from one of the reindeer's harnesses. The boy places the bell in the pocket of his robe and all the children watch as Santa takes off into the night for his annual deliveries. Later, on the train ride home, the boy discovers that the bell has fallen through a hole in his pocket. The boy arrives home and goes to his bedroom as the train pulls away. On Christmas morning, his sister finds a small package for the boy under the tree, behind all of the other gifts. The boy opens the box and discovers that it contains the bell, delivered by Santa along with a note explaining that he found it on the seat of his sleigh. When the boy rings the bell, both he and his sister marvel at the beautiful sound. His parents, however, are unable to hear the bell (since they don't believe in Santa) and remark that it must be broken. The book ends with the following line: Development Van Allsburg based the story on a mental image of a child wandering into the woods on a foggy night and wondering where a train was headed. At the premiere of the movie, Van Allsburg stated that Pere Marquette 1225, formerly owned by Michigan State University and now owned by the Steam Railroading Institute in Owosso, Michigan, was the inspiration for the story line. He played on the engine as a child when it was on display and was inspired by the number 1225, which to him was 12/25 ‚Äì Christmas Day. The real 1225 was used to create the animated image of the engine and all the locomotive sounds were recorded from the 1225. The only exception to this is the whistle, which was recorded from Sierra Railway No. 3. Reception In 1986, The Polar Express was awarded the Caldecott Medal and appeared on the New York Times bestseller list. By 1989, a million copies had been sold ‚Äì more each year than the last ‚Äì and the book had made the bestseller list four years in a row. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children.\\" It was one of the \\"Top 100 Picture Books\\" of all time in a 2012 poll by School Library Journal. Film adaptation The Polar Express is a 2004 American computer-animated film based on the book. Written, produced, and directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film features human characters animated using the live action performance capture technique. The film stars Daryl Sabara, Nona Gaye, Jimmy Bennett, Michael Jeter, Eddie Deezen and Tom Hanks. The film was first released in both conventional and IMAX 3D theaters November 10, 2004 and grossed $307 million worldwide.

It was financed by a consortium of British financial institutions and was distributed by Cinema International Corporation in the United Kingdom. Released on 19 October 1978, the film was an immediate success and it became the sixth-most popular film of 1979 at the UK box office. It features the voices of John Hurt, Richard Briers, Harry Andrews, Simon Cadell, Nigel Hawthorne and Roy Kinnear, among others, and was the last film work of Zero Mostel, as the voice of Kehaar the gull. The musical score was by Angela Morley and Malcolm Williamson. Art Garfunkel's hit song \\"Bright Eyes\\" was written by songwriter Mike Batt.  Plot  In Lapine language mythology, the world was created by the god Frith. All animals were grass eaters, living harmoniously. The rabbits multiplied, and their appetite led to a food shortage. Frith ordered the rabbit prince, El-Ahrairah, to control his people, but was scoffed at. In retaliation, Frith gave special gifts to every animal, making some into predators to hunt the rabbits. Satisfied that El-Ahrairah has learned his lesson, Frith gives rabbits the gifts of speed and cunning. In the present, in a warren near Sandleford, a rabbit seer named Fiver has an apocalyptic vision and takes his older brother Hazel to beg the chief for evacuation. The chief dismisses them, and orders Captain Holly, the head of the warren's Owsla police force, to stop those trying to leave. Fiver and Hazel along with other rabbits named Bigwig, Blackberry, Pipkin, Dandelion, Silver, and Violet manage to escape, passing a sign (meaningless to them) confirming that a residential development is coming. They journey through the woods, avoiding several dangerous situations until Violet‚Äîthe group's only doe‚Äîis killed by a hawk. The others eventually meet a rabbit named Cowslip, who invites them to his warren, where a farmer leaves Cowslip's group ample vegetables. They are grateful, but Fiver leaves when he senses something unsettling in the atmosphere. Bigwig follows, berating Fiver for causing tension, when a snare catches Bigwig. Bigwig's friends manage to free him, and Fiver learns that the farmer is protecting and feeding Cowslip's warren so that he can snare rabbits for his own meals. The group returns to its journey. The rabbits discover Nuthanger Farm, which contains a hutch of domesticated does. Before they can free the females, the farm cat and dog chase them away. Later, they are found by Captain Holly, who recounts the destruction of Sandleford by humans as well as vicious rabbits called the \\"Efrafans\\". Fiver finally finds the hill he envisioned, Watership Down, where the group settles in with Hazel as their new chief. They soon befriend an injured black-headed seagull named Kehaar, who flies out in search of does. That night, the rabbits return to Nuthanger Farm to free the does, but an attempt to free them fails which ends with Hazel getting shot. Fiver follows a vision of the mythical Black Rabbit to his injured brother. Kehaar returns and, while pecking out buckshot from Hazel's leg with his beak, reports of the many does at the large Efrafa warren. Captain Holly describes it as a dangerous totalitarian state, but Hazel feels they must go there. Bigwig infiltrates the warren and is made an Owsla officer by their cruel chief, General Woundwort. Bigwig recruits several potential escapees to his cause, including Blackavar and Hyzenthlay. With Kehaar's help, the escapees find a boat to float down the river. That night, Kehaar leaves for his homeland with the gratitude of the warren. Efrafan trackers eventually find Watership Down. Woundwort rejects Hazel's offer of peace and demands that all deserters must be turned over or Watership Down will be wiped out. While the Watership rabbits barricade their warren, Fiver slips into a trance, in which he envisions a dog loose in the woods. His mumblings inspire Hazel to try and retrieve the farm dog and lead it to the Efrafans. When they arrive at the farm, Hazel unties the dog and releases it while Blackberry, Dandelion and Hyzenthlay use themselves as bait to make the animal follow them. Meanwhile, the Efrafans break through the warren's defences. Woundwort easily slays Blackavar, then violently battles with Bigwig. When the dog arrives and starts attacking the Efrafan soldiers, Woundwort fearlessly stands his ground and viciously lunges at the dog. However, no trace of Woundwort is ever found which leaves his fate a mystery. Several years later, an elderly Hazel is visited by the Black Rabbit, who invites him to join his own Owsla, assuring him of Watership Down's perpetual safety. Reassured, Hazel accepts and dies peacefully. His spirit follows the Black Rabbit through the woodland and trees towards the Sun, which metamorphoses into Frith, and the afterlife, as Frith's parting advice to El- Ahrairah is heard once more.

He did this with the assistance of a merchant banker, Jake Eberts, who enjoyed the experience so much it launched Eberts's career in the film industry. The option for the film rights was ¬£50,000.Eberts p 11-12 Rosen estimated the budget at $2.4 million. Eberts raised $1 million from the Pearson company and clients of the merchant bank Lazard.Eberts p 14 Production of the film began in 1975 by a new animation studio, formed in London by Rosen. It was originally going to be directed by John Hubley, who left after disagreements with the film's producer Martin Rosen. His work can still be found in the film, most notably in the \\"fable\\" scene. He was replaced by Rosen who thereby made his directorial debut. After the genesis story, which was rendered in a narrated simple cartoon fashion, the animation style changes to a detailed, naturalistic one. There are concessions to render the animals anthropomorphic only to suggest that they have human voices and minds, some facial expressions for emotion, and paw gestures. The animation backgrounds are watercolors. Only one of the predators, the farm cat Tab, is given a few lines, the rest remaining mute. The backgrounds and locations, especially Efrafa and the nearby railway, are based on the diagrams and maps in Richard Adams's original novel. Most of the locations in the movie either exist or were based on real spots in Hampshire and surrounding areas. Although the film is fairly faithful to the novel, several changes were made to the storyline, mainly to decrease overly detailed complexity and improve the pace and flow of the plot. In addition, the order in which some events occur is re-arranged. Unlike many animated features, the film faithfully emulated the dark and violent sophistication of the book. As a result, many reviewers took to warning parents that children might find the content disturbing. When the film was first submitted to the British Board of Film Classification, the BBFC passed the film with a 'U' certificate (suitable for all ages, similar to the MPAA's \\"G\\" rating), deciding that \\"whilst the film may move children emotionally during the film's duration, it could not seriously trouble them once the spell of the story is broken and a 'U' certificate was therefore quite appropriate\\".BBFC Examiners Report 15 February 1978 https://www.bbfc.co.uk/sites/default/files/attachments/Watership-Down- report.pdf This choice has been quite controversial though, and in 2012, the BBFC admitted that it had \\"received complaints about the suitability of Watership Down at 'U' almost every year since its classification\\". In the U.S. the film was rated PG due to the violent scenes. Some marketers in the U.S. also worried that the main promotional poster appeared too dark and might scare some children. The poster is actually showing Bigwig in a snare (his distinctive fur is clearly visible), yet the image on the poster does not appear in the film, which contains a far bloodier depiction of the scene. = Music = The musical score was by Angela Morley and Malcolm Williamson, Morley replacing Williamson after the composer had fallen behind and only composed the prelude and main title theme in sketch form. A list of the musical cues for the film can be found on the composer's website, which also gives information about the different composers working on the project. The soundtrack includes Art Garfunkel's British No. 1 hit, \\"Bright Eyes\\", which was written by the British singer and songwriter Mike Batt. He also wrote other songs for the film which were not used. The composer recorded three songs with vocals by Garfunkel, but only \\"Bright Eyes\\" made it to the film. The song \\"When You're Losing Your Way in the Rain\\" has a very similar feeling and arrangement, and was recorded by the former Zombies vocalist Colin Blunstone in 1979. Garfunkel's version was heard years later, on the TV series soundtrack released in 2000. The song, like many others which appeared on the TV soundtrack, was never used in the show.  Release and reception  Watership Down was first released to the UK on 19 October 1978, and was later released in the United States on 1 November 1978, for the latter, the movie was distributed by AVCO Embassy Pictures. The film has received a mostly positive critical reception, with an 82% 'Fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews. The critical consensus reads: \\"Aimed at adults perhaps more than children, this is a respectful, beautifully animated adaptation of Richard Adams' beloved book.\\" The film was nominated for Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 1979. In 2004, the magazine Total Film named Watership Down the 47th-greatest British film of all time and it was also ranked 15th in the \\"100 Greatest Tearjerkers\\". When Watership Down was released the film was very successful. According to financier Jake Eberts the investors who put up the $50,000 development finance \\"got their money back with interest, plus an additional $450,000, making a total of ten times their investment\\".Eberts p 17-18 Other investors in the film reportedly received a return of 5,000% on their investment.Alexander Walker, Icons in the Fire: The Rise and Fall of Practically Everyone in the British Film Industry 1984‚Äì2000, Orion Books, 2005 p6  Media  = Picture book = A picture book adaptation was also produced, titled The Watership Down Film Picture Book. Two editions of the book were published, one a hardcover, the other a reinforced cloth-bound edition. The contents include film stills linked with a combination of narration and extracts from the script, as well as a preface by Adams and a foreword by Rosen. = Home media releases = Watership Down was initially released on VHS in the UK by Thorn EMI Video, then later by Guild Home Video and later by PolyGram Video. It was given a DVD release in 2001 by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and another in 2005 from Warner Home Video. In the US, Watership Down was first released on CED in 1981 and was given a VHS release in 1983 by Warner Home Video. The film was re-released a number of times on VHS in the US by Warner Home Video, including through their Warner Bros. Classic Tales label, and was released on DVD in the US in 2002 and again in 2008. A UK Blu-ray for the film was planned to be released in 2010 but, due to a rights dispute between Euro-London Films, Universal Pictures, and Warner Bros., the release was canceled. Warner eventually put out a BD release in Germany, where it held distribution rights. The UK Blu-ray was eventually released in 2013 by Universal using the same HD master as on Warner's 2008 DVD and 2011 German Blu-ray release. In 2014, Euro-London Films acquired the remaining US rights from Warner Bros. (who had held US distribution rights since the 1980s) and licensed the film to The Criterion Collection for release on DVD, Blu-ray and streaming in 2015 and Janus Films for theatrical repertory runs.

The field represents an archaeological- palaeoecological approach to studying the palaeoenvironment through the methods of human palaeoecology. Reconstructing past environments and past peoples' relationships and interactions with the landscapes they inhabited provides archaeologists with insights into the origin and evolution of anthropogenic environments, and prehistoric adaptations and economic practices. Environmental archaeology is commonly divided into three sub- fields: * archaeobotany (the study of plant remains) * zooarchaeology (the study of faunal remains) * geoarchaeology (the study of geological processes and their relationship to the archaeological record) Environmental archaeology often involves studying plant and animal remains in order to investigate which plant and animal species were present at the time of prehistoric habitations, and how past societies managed them. It may also involve studying the physical environment and how similar or different it was in the past compared to the present day. An important component of such analyses represents the study of site formation processes. This field is particularly useful when artifacts may be absent from an excavated or surveyed site, or in cases of earth movement, such as erosion, which may have buried artifacts and archaeological features. While specialist sub-fields, for example bioarchaeology or geomorphology, are defined by the materials they study, the term \\"environmental\\" is used as a general template in order to denote a general field of scientific inquiry that is applicable across time periods and geographical regions studied by archaeology as a whole.  Subfields  = Archaeobotany = Animal remains Archaeobotany is the study and interpretation of plant remains. By determining the uses of plants in historical contexts, researchers can reconstruct the diets of past humans, as well as determine their subsistence strategies and plant economy. This provides greater insight into a people's social and cultural behaviors. Analysis of specimen like wood charcoal, for example, can reveal the source of fuel or construction for a society. Archaeobotanists also often study seed and fruit remains, along with pollen and starch. Plants can be preserved in a variety of ways, but the most common are carbonization, water logging, mineralization, and desiccation. A field within archaeobotany is ethnobotany, which looks more specifically at the relationship between plants and humans, and the cultural impacts plants have had and continue to have on human societies. Plant usage as food and as crops or as medicine is of interest, as well the plants' economic influences. = Zooarchaeology = Zooarchaeology is the study of animal remains and what these remains can tell us about the human societies the animals existed among. Animal remains can provide evidence of predation by humans (or vice versa) or domestication. Despite revealing the specific relationships between animals and humans, discovery of animal bones, hides, or DNA in a certain area can describe the location's past landscape or climate. = Geoarchaeology = Geoarchaeology is the study of landscape and of geological processes. It looks at environments within the human timeline to determine how past societies may have influenced or been influenced by the environment. Sediment and soil are often studied because this is where the majority of artifacts are found, but also because natural processes and human behavior can alter the soil and reveal its history. Apart from visual observation, computer programming and satellite imaging are often employed to reconstruct past landscapes or architecture. Other related fields include: *landscape archaeology *bioarchaeology and human ecology *climatology *palaeoecology *archival research  History  The human environment department of the UCL Institute of Archaeology in the 1970s. Environmental archaeology has emerged as a distinct discipline in the course of the last 50 years. In recent years it has grown rapidly in significance and is now an established component of most excavation projects. The field is multidisciplinary, and environmental archaeologists, as well as palaeoecologists, work side by side with archaeologists and anthropologists specialising in material culture studies in order to achieve a more holistic understanding of past human livelihood and people-environment interactions, especially how climatic stress affected humans and forced them to adapt. In archaeology in the 1960s, the environment was seen as having a \\"passive\\" interaction with humans. With the inclusion of Darwinism and ecological principles, however, this paradigm began to shift. Prominent theories and principles of the time (oasis theory, catastrophism, and longue duree) emphasized this philosophy. Catastrophism, for instance, discussed how catastrophes like natural disaster could be the determining factor in a society's survival. The environment could have social, political, and economic impacts on human communities. It became more important for researchers to look at the direct influence the environment could have on a society. This gave rise to middle range theory and the major questions asked by environmental archaeology in the 20th and 21st centuries. Research has since led environmental archaeology to two major conclusions: humanity originated in Africa and agriculture originated in south-west Asia. Another important shift in thinking within the field centered around the notion of cost-effectivity. Before, archaeologists thought that humans usually acted to maximize their use of resources, but have since come to believe that this is not the case. Subsequent theories/principles include sociality and agency, and the focus on relationships between archaeological sites. Government research audits and the 'commercialisation' of environmental archaeology have also shaped the sub- discipline in more recent times. = Notable contributors= Louis Leakey contributed to a vast amount of research in this field. Leakey and his wife Mary Leakey are most known for their work on human origins in Africa. Louis Binford developed the middle range theory. Under this theory, researchers study the relationship between humans and the environment, which can be depicted in models. Eric Higgs researched the development of agriculture in Asia and the method of \\"site catchment analysis\\", which looks at the exploitation of land based on the land's potential. Karl Butzer is a notable pioneer of environmental archaeology and has won numerous awards and conducted research in the fields of archaeology, geography, and geology. Douglas Kennett studies environmental archaeology and human behavioral ecology. He is most known for his work investigating how climate change affected Maya civilization in its development and disintegration.  Methods  Environmental archaeologists approach a site through evaluation and/or excavation. Evaluation seeks to analyze the resources and artifacts given in an area and their potential significance. Excavation takes samples from different layers in the ground and uses a similar strategy to evaluation. The samples typically sought after are human and faunal remains, pollen and spores, wood and charcoal, insects, and even isotopes. Biomolecules like lipids, proteins, and DNA can be revelatory samples. With respect to geoarchaeology, computer systems for topography and satellites imaging are often used to reconstruct landscapes. The Geographic Information System (GIS) is a computer system that can process spatial data and construct virtual landscapes. Climate records are able to be reconstructed through paleoclimatology proxies, which can provide information on temperatures, precipitation, vegetation, and other climate-dependent conditions. These proxies can be used to provide context for present climate and compare past climate against the present.  Significance  Lake sediment core used to help archaeologists reconstruct past climates. Each focus within environmental archaeology collects information about a different aspect of humans' relation with their surrounding environment. Together these components (along with methods from other fields) are combined to fully understand a past society‚Äôs lifestyle and interactions with their environment. Environmental archaeology: theoretical and practical approaches. Place of publication not identified: Routledge, 2016. Past aspects of land use, food production, tool use, and occupation patterns can all be established and the knowledge applied to current and future human-environment interactions. Through predation, agriculture, and introduction of foreign biota into new environments, humans have altered past environments. Understanding these past processes can help us pursue conservation and restorative processes in the present. Environmental archaeology provides insight on sustainability and why some cultures collapsed while others survived. Societal collapse has occurred many times throughout history, one of the most prominent examples being the Maya civilization. Using lake sediment core and climate reconstruction technology discussed earlier, archaeologists were able to reconstruct the climate present at the time of the Mayans. Although the Yucat√°n Peninsula was found to have extreme drought at the time Mayan society collapsed, many other factors contributed to their demise. Deforestation, overpopulation, and manipulating wetlands are only a few theories as to why the Maya civilization collapsed, but all of these worked in tandem to negatively impact the environment. From a sustainability perspective, studying how the Mayans impacted the environment allows researchers to see how these changes have permanently affected the landscape and subsequent populations living in the area. Archaeologists are increasingly under pressure to demonstrate that their work has impact beyond the discipline. This has prompted environmental archaeologists to argue that an understanding of past environmental changes is essential to model future outcomes in areas such as climate change, land cover change, soil health and food security.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 19, 2000. The episode shows Bart's future as a washed-up, wannabe rock musician living with Ralph Wiggum, while Lisa has become the President of the United States and tries to get the country out of financial trouble. \\"Bart to the Future\\" was the second episode of The Simpsons to be set in the future, following \\"Lisa's Wedding.\\" The episode was directed by Michael Marcantel and written by Dan Greaney, who wanted to explore what Bart's life would end up like. Several designs were made by the animators for future Bart, but Greaney did not think they matched the personality of the character and had to give clearer instructions on how he wanted him to look. Reception of \\"Bart to the Future\\" by critics has been generally mixed. Around 8.77 million American homes tuned in to watch the episode during its original airing. In 2008, it was released on DVD along with the rest of the episodes of the eleventh season. The episode attracted renewed attention in the events leading up to the 2016 presidential election, because of a reference to the presidency of Donald Trump. Plot Thirty years into the future, Bart is a 40-year-old beer-drinking slacker trying to launch his music career after dropping out of the DeVry Institute. He lives with his bandmate Ralph Wiggum in a beach cottage by the shore, where they are struggling to make ends meet and have resorted to mooching off Bart's parents and their neighbor Ned Flanders. The only gig Bart and Ralph can get is at a beach bar owned by Nelson Muntz, and even then, they are only paid in popcorn shrimp. The morning after their disastrous concert at Nelson's bar, Bart and Ralph find out that they have been evicted from their house. Meanwhile, 38-year-old Lisa becomes the first straight female President of the United States, and moves into the White House, to where Bart quickly moves in and invites their parents to live in, and his antics prove a burden on Lisa's political activities, much to Lisa's discomfort. Homer uses the time to search for gold buried by Abraham Lincoln on the grounds of the White House. When he finally locates the \\"gold\\", it is in fact a chest with a scroll in it that Lincoln had written on explaining that his \\"gold\\" is \\"in the heart of every freedom-loving American.\\" Homer does not appreciate the metaphor and angrily curses Lincoln; when present-day Bart asks the manager about this subplot, he claims that he needed filler after the main vision became \\"too thin\\". Bart disrupts one of Lisa's addresses to the nation to promote his music career, which leads Lisa to be branded unpopular when Bart sings to the public on live television that Lisa will be imposing a tax rise to get the country out of debt; the leaders of America's creditor nations then demand that America pay them back. Frustrated with his antics, Lisa distracts Bart by making him president of \\"keeping it real\\". His conscience manifests in the form of Billy Carter's ghost, who reminds him that he is an embarrassment because of his actions and suggests he atone for his mistakes. Bart steps in at Lisa's meeting with the leaders and uses his skills at stalling debt collectors to save the day, promising the money will soon be repaid in full, pleasing Lisa. As a thank-you, Bart asks Lisa to \\"legalize it\\", and Lisa says she will. Production \\"Bart to the Future\\" was written by Dan Greaney and directed by Michael Marcantel as part of the eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999‚Äì2000). It was the second episode of the series to show the Simpson family's life in the future, following the season six episode \\"Lisa's Wedding\\" that aired five years earlier in 1995. Three more future-set episodes have been released since \\"Bart to the Future\\", the first being Future-Drama (season 16, 2005), second being \\"Holidays of Future Passed\\" (season 23, 2011) and third being \\"Days of Future Future\\" (season 25, 2014). Greaney's inspiration for \\"Bart to the Future\\" came from \\"Lisa's Wedding\\". He and The Simpsons writer Matt Selman were sitting in Greaney's office one day, trying to come up with new episode stories, when they received the idea of making a companion piece to that episode.Selman, Matt (2008). Audio commentary for \\"Bart to the Future\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Greaney wanted to write an episode set in the future that focused on Bart instead of Lisa. He thought it would be interesting to explore how the future works out for \\"a guy like Bart, who doesn't pay attention to school work and is all about being cool.\\" Selman commented in an audio commentary for \\"Bart to the Future\\" that \\"the thing that really got the [Simpsons] writers excited about the episode was this very specific version of future Bart.\\" Greaney identified this version as \\"the guy who blames everyone else and tells everyone else that they used to be cool, that it's everyone else's fault that his life hasn't gone the way he wants it to go.\\" The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully also noted that future Bart is the kind of person who is \\"always waiting for some big sort of cash payoff that he feels he's owed whether it be an insurance settlement, an inheritance, or something that's gonna come sooner or later.\\" Greaney said that everyone in the writing room recognized these traits from people they knew and therefore everyone contributed to the episode by suggesting lines for Bart to say and things for him to do. Ralph, Bart, Homer and Marge in the future. The original designs of future Bart were different to the one used here. According to Greaney, the animators originally designed future Bart as \\"cool and fun\\" and made several designs where he was \\"slim, attractive, and hip.\\" Greaney did not think any of these designs went along with the personality he and the other writers had assigned to future Bart, so he told the animators to draw the character with belly fat, a ponytail, sags under his eyes, and one earring. Scully said on the audio commentary that he thought the design of Bart looked \\"great\\", though he added that it was \\"slightly disturbing\\" to see the older versions of Homer and Marge in the episode, and joked that it is \\"a little bit sad to watch cartoon characters age.\\" Greaney needed a setpiece for the episode that enabled him to get into a vision of the characters in the future, and The Simpsons writer George Meyer came up with the idea of the Indian casino.Greaney, Dan (2008). Audio commentary for \\"Bart to the Future\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. When Homer and Bart first enter the casino, Homer tells Bart that \\"Although they seem strange to us, we must respect the ways of the Indian.\\" He proceeds to greet everyone in the casino by saying \\"Hi-how-are-you?\\" in the rhythm of a stereotypical Native American chant. This joke was pitched by Tom Gammill, and there was a debate among the staff of the show about whether or not to include it in the episode as Native Americans could find it offensive. However, according to Scully, Dan Castellaneta (who voices Homer) \\"did [the joke] so funny when we were at the table-read so we decided to put it in and risk offending.\\"Scully, Mike (2008). Audio commentary for \\"Bart to the Future\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Release and reception The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 19, 2000. It was viewed in approximately 8.77 million households that night. With a Nielsen rating of 8.7, the episode finished 28th in the ratings for the week of March 13‚Äì19, 2000. It was the second highest-rated broadcast on Fox that week, following an episode of Malcolm in the Middle (which received a 10.0 rating and was watched in 10.1 million homes). On October 7, 2008, \\"Bart to the Future\\" was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Eleventh Season. Staff members Mike Scully, Dan Greaney, Matt Selman, and George Meyer participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set. \\"Bart to the Future\\" has received mixed reviews from critics compared to \\"Lisa's Wedding\\" which met with positive response. Nancy Basile of About.com listed it as one of the episodes she felt \\"shined in season eleven\\". While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on \\"Bart to the Future\\", writing: \\"This kind of fantasy episode can be hit or miss, and that trend holds true here. However, more of 'Future' succeeds than flops. Though a few gags bomb, most of them prove pretty good. At no point does this become a classic, but it amuses much of the time.\\" Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club wrote in 2011 that the episode \\"was not so good, although better than many of the real stinkers yet to come at that point. Still, it utterly failed to rise to the challenge of 'Lisa‚Äôs Wedding.'\\" In 2003, Ben Rayner of Toronto Star referred to \\"Bart to the Future\\" as \\"a lame 2000 outing\\" and noted that Entertainment Weekly \\"rightly dubbed [it] the 'worst episode ever'\\". Winnipeg Free Press columnist Randall King wrote in his review of season eleven that the episode \\"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\\" (which features the death of the character Maude Flanders) was \\"proof that the dependably brilliant series could ‚Äì and did ‚Äì go seriously wrong when it turned 11. Killing off Maude was a sin compounded by the Bart to the Future episode [...]\\". In his 2006 book Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality, Jonathan Gray analyzed the many advertisement parodies featured in The Simpsons. He commented on \\"Bart to the Future\\", writing: \\"As if ads in children's toys or in churches are not enough, in 'Bart to the Future,' an episode in which an Indian shaman at a casino treats Bart to a vision of his future, even his vision is interrupted when future-Bart says, 'I guess I am an embarrassment,' and a ghost responds, 'You sure are. But, hey, there's an embarrassment of riches at the Caesar's Pow-Wow Indian Casino. You can bet on it!' Here [...] The Simpsons uses parody with great effect, not only to illustrate how annoyingly and disrespectfully ads infringe on any territory, but also to mock their logic and rhetoric.\\" Donald Trump presidency News media highlighted the mention of Donald Trump when he ran for president and won the election sixteen years later. The episode mentions that real estate mogul and millionaire Donald Trump became president, and caused a budget crisis that Lisa inherits. In 2015, news media cited the episode as a foreshadowing of Trump's future run for president; the episode was produced during Trump's 2000 third-party run. Dan Greaney told The Hollywood Reporter in a 2016 interview that the thought of a Trump presidency at the time \\"just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom. It was pitched because it was consistent with the vision of America going insane.\\" In an interview with TMZ in May 2016, Matt Groening said he thought it was unlikely that Donald Trump would become the president of the United States. On November 8, 2016, Trump was elected as the 45th president of the United States. Four days later, in the opening credits of the episode \\"Havana Wild Weekend\\", aired on November 13, 2016, Bart writes \\"Being right sucks\\" as the chalkboard gag. Scenes from a 2015 Simpsons YouTube post \\"Trumptastic Voyage\\" (which references real-life scenes of Donald Trump around that time) have been mistakenly identified as those from \\"Bart to the Future\\".

It mostly consists of pieces written to be sung by a church choir, which may sing a cappella or accompanied by an organ. Anglican music forms an important part of traditional worship not only in the Church of England, but also in the Scottish Episcopal Church, the Church in Wales, the Church of Ireland, the Episcopal Church in America, the Anglican Church of Canada, the Anglican Church of Australia and other Christian denominations which identify as Anglican. It can also be used at the Personal Ordinariates of the Roman Catholic Church. Forms The chief musical forms in Anglican church music are centred around the forms of worship defined in the liturgy. =Service settings= Service settings are choral settings of the words of the liturgy. These include: ; The Ordinary of the Eucharist : Sung Eucharist is a musical setting of the service of Holy Communion. Naming conventions may vary according to the churchmanship of the place of worship; in churches that tend towards a low church or broad church style of worship, the terms Eucharist or Communion are common, while in high church worship, the more Catholic term Mass may be used. Musical pieces corresponding to the liturgical pattern of the Ordinary of the Mass (Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus & Benedictus, Agnus Dei) may be sung by the choir or congregation. Many English-language settings of the communion service have been written, such as those by Herbert Howells and Harold Darke; simpler settings suitable for congregational singing are also used, such as the services by John Merbecke or Martin Shaw. In high church worship, Latin Mass settings are often preferred, such as those by William Byrd. ; Morning Service : The Anglican service of morning prayer, known as Mattins, is a peculiarly Anglican service which originated in 1552 as an amalgam of the monastic offices of Matins, Lauds and Prime in Thomas Cranmer‚Äôs Second Prayer Book of Edward VI. Choral settings of the Morning Service may include the opening preces and responses (see below), the Venite, and the morning canticles of Te Deum, Benedicite, Benedictus, Jubilate and a Kyrie. ; Evening Service : Evening Prayer, also known as Evensong, consists of preces and responses, Psalms, canticles, hymns and an anthem (see below). The evening canticles are the Magnificat and the Nunc Dimittis, and these texts have been set to music by many composers. Herbert Howells alone composed 20 settings of the canticles, including his Collegium Regale (1944) and St Paul's (1950) services. Like Mattins, Evensong is a service that is a distinctively Anglican service, originating in the Book of Common Prayer of 1549 as a combination of the offices of Vespers and Compline. Choral Evensong is sung daily in most Church of England cathedrals, as well as in churches and cathedrals throughout the Anglican Communion. It is noted for its particular appeal to worshippers and visitors, attracting both believers and atheists with its meditative quality and cultural value. A service of Choral Evensong is broadcast weekly on BBC Radio 3, a tradition begun in 1926. =Preces and responses = The Preces (or versicles) and responses are a set of prayers from the Book of Common Prayer for both Morning and Evening Prayer. They may be sung antiphonally by the priest (or a lay cantor) and choir. There are a number of popular choral settings by composers such as William Smith or Bernard Rose; alternatively, they may be sung as plainsong with a congregation. =Psalm= Morning and Evening Prayer and Holy Communion include a Psalm, chosen according to the lectionary of the day. This may be sung by the choir or congregation, either to plainsong, or to a distinctive type of chant known as Anglican chant by the choir or congregation. =Anthems or motets= Part-way through a service of worship, a choir may sing an anthem or motet, a standalone piece of sacred choral music, which is not part of the liturgy but is usually chosen to reflect to the liturgical theme of the day. =Hymns= The singing of hymns is a common feature of Anglican worship and usually includes congregational singing as well as a choir. An Introit hymn is sung at the start of a service, a Gradual hymn precedes the Gospel, an Offertory hymn is sung during the Offertory and a recessional hymn at the close of a service. =Organ voluntary= A piece for organ, known as a voluntary, is often played at the end of a service of worship after the recessional hymn. Performance A choir singing choral evensong in York Minster Almost all Anglican church music is written for choir with or without organ accompaniment. Adult singers in a cathedral choir are often referred to as lay clerks, while children may be referred to as choristers or trebles. In certain places of worship, such as Winchester College in England, the more archaic spelling quirister is used. An Anglican choir typically uses \\"SATB\\" voices (soprano or treble, alto or counter-tenor, tenor, and bass), though in many works some or all of these voices are divided into two for part or all of the piece; in this case the two halves of the choir (one on each side of the aisle) are traditionally named decani and cantoris which sing, repectively, Choir 1 and Choir 2 in two-choir music. There may also be soloists, usually only for part of the piece. There are also works for fewer voices, such as those written for solely men's voices or boys'/women's voices. Many more recent works were written for, or dedicated to, one of the many famous cathedral or collegiate choirs of England. Vestments At traditional Anglican choral services, a choir is vested, i.e. clothed in special ceremonial vestments. These are normally a cassock, a long, full-length robe which may be purple, red or black in colour, over which is worn a surplice, a knee-length white cotton robe. Normally a surplice is only worn during a service of worship, so a choir often rehearses wearing cassocks only. Younger choristers who have newly joined a choir begin to wear a surplice after an initial probationary period. Cassocks originated in the medieval period as day dress for clergy, but later came into liturgical use. Additionally, choristers may wear a ruff, an archaic form of dress collar, although this tradition is becoming less common. In some establishments, including King's College Choir, Eton collars are worn. Whist singing the offices, adult choir members may also wear an academic hood over their robes. In England, young choristers who have attained a certain level of proficiency with the Royal School of Church Music, an international educational organisation that promotes liturgical music, may wear an RSCM medallion. History Prior to the Reformation, music in British churches and cathedrals consisted mainly of Gregorian chant and polyphonic settings of the Latin Mass. The Anglican church did not exist as such, but the foundations of Anglican music were laid with music from the Catholic liturgy. In the early 1530s, the break with Rome under King Henry VIII set in motion the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church and the Reformation in England. The Church of England's Latin liturgy was replaced with scripture and prayers in English; the Great Bible in English was authorised in 1539 and Thomas Cranmer introduced the Book of Common Prayer in 1549. These changes were reflected in church music, and works that had previously been sung in Latin began to be replaced with new music in English. This gave rise to an era of great creativity during the Tudor period, in which composition of music for Anglican worship flourished. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, musicians of the Chapel Royal such as Thomas Tallis, Robert Parsons and William Byrd were called upon to demonstrate that the new Protestantism was no less splendid than the old Catholic religion. Following the events of the English Civil War and the execution of King Charles I, Puritan influences took hold in the Church of England. Anglican church music became simpler in style, and services typically focused on morning and evening prayer. During the Restoration period, musical practices of the Baroque era found their way into Anglican worship, and stringed or brass instruments sometimes accompanied choirs. In the late 17th century, the composer Henry Purcell, who served as organist of both the Chapel Royal and Westminster Abbey, wrote many choral anthems and service settings. During the Georgian era, the music of George Frideric Handel was highly significant, with his repertoire of anthems, canticles and hymns, although he never held a church post. Up until the early 19th century, most Anglican church music in England was centred around the cathedrals, where trained choirs would sing choral pieces in worship. Composers wrote music to make full use of the traditional cathedral layout of a segregated chancel area and the arrangement of choir stalls into rows of Decani and Cantoris, writing antiphonal anthems. In parish churches, musical worship normally only consisted of congregational hymns, while prayers and psalms were normally said rather than sung. The tradition of a robed choir of men and boys was virtually unknown in Anglican parish churches until the early 19th century. Around 1839, a choral revival took hold in England, partially fuelled by the Oxford Movement, which sought to revive Catholic liturgical practice in Anglican churches. Despite opposition from more Puritan-minded Anglicans, ancient practices such as intoning the versicles and responses and chanted Psalms were introduced. Composers active around this time included Samuel Sebastian Wesley and Charles Villiers Stanford. A number of grandiose settings of the Anglican morning and evening canticles for choir and organ were composed in the late 19th and early 20th century, including settings by Thomas Attwood Walmisley, Charles Wood, Thomas Tertius Noble, Basil Harwood and George Dyson, works which remain part of the Anglican choral repertoire today. The singing of hymns was not an integral part of Anglican Orders of Service until the early nineteenth century, and hymns, as opposed to metrical psalms, were not officially sanctioned.H. Eskew, H.T. McElrath, Sing with Understanding: An Introduction to Christian Hymnology, 1980, p. 135 From about 1800 parish churches started to use different hymn collections in informal service like the Lock Hospital Collection (1769) by Martin Madan, the Olney hymnsOlney hymns (1779) by John Newton and William Cowper and A Collection of Hymns for the Use of The People Called MethodistsA Collection of Hymns for the Use of The People Called Methodists (1779) by John Wesley and Charles Wesley.James Moffatt, Handbook to the Church Hymnary, Oxford University Press, 1927, p. 404 Anglican hymnody was revitalised by the Oxford Movement and led to the publication hymnals such as Hymns Ancient and Modern (1861). The English Hymnal, edited by Percy Dearmer and Ralph Vaughan Williams, was published in 1906, and became one of the most influential hymn books ever published. It was supplanted in 1986 by the New English Hymnal. The popular appeal of Christmas carols owes much to Anglican musicians; published collections such as Oxford Book of Carols (1928) and Carols for Choirs, and the annual broadcast of Nine Lessons and Carols from King's College, Cambridge have done much to popularise church music. Following the early music revival of the mid-20th century, the publication of collections such as the Oxford Book of Tudor Anthems encouraged renewed interest in 17th-century composers such as Byrd and Tallis. In all but the smallest churches the congregation was until recently confined to the singing of hymns. Over the past half century or so efforts have been made to increase the role of the congregation and also to introduce more \\"popular\\" musical styles in the evangelical and charismatic leaning congregations. Not all churches can boast a full SATB choir, and a repertoire of one-, two- and three-part music is more suitable for many parish church choirs, a fact which is recognised in the current work of the Royal School of Church Music. Anglican churches also frequently draw upon the musical traditions of other Christian denominations. Works by Catholic composers such as Mozart, Lutherans such as Bach, Calvinists like Mendelssohn, and composers from other branches of Christianity are often featured. This is particularly the case in music for the Mass in Anglo-Catholic churches, much of which is taken from the work of Roman Catholic composers.

Early life Forssk√•l was born in Helsinki, now in Finland but then a part of Sweden, where his father, Johannes Forssk√•l, was serving as a Lutheran clergyman, but the family migrated to Sweden in 1741 when the father was appointed to the parish of Tegelsmora in Uppland and the archdiocese of Uppsala. As was common at the time, he enrolled at Uppsala University at a young age in 1742, but returned home for some time and, after studies on his own, rematriculated in Uppsala in 1751, where he completed a theological degree the same year. Linnaeus's disciple In Uppsala Forssk√•l was one of the students of Linnaeus, but apparently also studied with the orientalist Carl Aurivillius, whose contacts with the G√∂ttingen orientalist Johann David Michaelis are probably the reason why Forssk√•l travelled to the University of G√∂ttingen in 1753; he studied Oriental languages and Philosophy and completed a doctorate there with a dissertation entitled Dubia de principiis philosophiae recentioris (1756). Returning to Uppsala in 1756, he wanted to pursue studies in Economics. In November 1759 he published a political pamphlet called, in Swedish, Tankar om borgerliga frihetenFacsimile of the swedish version from 1759 at Swedish Wikisource (Thoughts on civil liberty). As it advocated complete freedom of print, it was at the time controversial and was consequently suppressed by the authorities on the day of publication.Thoughts on Civil Liberty / Tankar om borgerliga friheten (1759). Stockholm: Bokf√∂rlaget Atlantis, 2009; http://www.peterforsskal.com/firstedition.html 'The pamphlet was censored by the \\"Hat\\" government and caused him to be warned by the Royal Chancellery. Journey to Yemen and death On Michaelis's recommendation, and with Linnaeus's approval, Forssk√•l the next year (1760) was appointed by Frederick V of Denmark to join, amongst others, the orientalist and mathematician Carsten Niebuhr on an expedition to Arabia. The group first went to Egypt where they stayed for about a year, with Forssk√•l pursuing studies in Arabic dialects, and arrived in South Arabia (Arabia Felix, present-day Yemen) at the end of December 1762. Just 31 years old, Forssk√•l worked hard on collecting botanical and zoological specimens, but fell ill with malaria and died in July 1763. He was buried at night in Yarim, Yemen. Linnaeus mourned the death of his young student and named one of the plants Forssk√•l had sent home Forsskaolea tenacissima because the plant was as stubborn and persistent as the young man had been. The entire journey of this Danish expedition was the subject of Thorkild Hansen's first book, Det lykkelige Arabien (1962, translated into English as Arabia Felix). Legacy Forssk√•l's companion Niebuhr, who was the only one of the participants to survive the expedition, was entrusted with the care of editing his manuscripts, and published in 1775 Descriptiones Animalium ‚Äì Avium, amphiborum, insectorum, vermium qu√¶ in itinere orientali observavit Petrus Forsk√•l. In the same year his account of the plants of Yemen and of lower Egypt also appeared, under the title of Flora √Ügyptiaco-Arabica sive descriptiones plantarum quas per √Ügyptum Inferiorem et Arabiam felicem detexit, illustravit Petrus Forsk√•l. Most of his specimens were lost in transport or deteriorated due to bad storage in Copenhagen; his herbarium was reconstructed some 150 years after his death by the botanist Carl Christensen. In his taxonomy work, Forssk√•l used the local Arabic name of the fish as the species name: these reflect the names used then (and now) on the coasts of the Red Sea for many species of fish. In his pamphlet, Thoughts on Civil Liberty (1759), Forssk√•l argues the case for civil liberties of the kind people in modern democracies ‚Äì regrettably ‚Äì take for granted. A sample (para 21): > Finally, another important right in any free society is the liberty to > contribute to the Public Good. But for this to happen, it must be possible > to make the state of affairs in society known to one and all, and everyone > must be free to express their thoughts about it. Where this is lacking, > liberty is not worth its name. Shortly after its publication the pamphlet was banned, and Forssk√•l was forced into exile. But only seven years later, in 1766, freedom of the press was given protection in Swedish constitutional law -- the first such legislation in world history. (Under the reign of Gustaf III Sweden fell back into repression. Freedom of the press was reinstated in the Constitution of 1809.) Variant spellings of his name In subsequent botanical works many different variants of his name were recorded (Forssk√•l, Forsk√•l, Forsk√•hl, Forssk√•hl, Forsskaal, Forskal, Forsskal, occasionally also Forsskaol).Friis, I. & Thulin, M. 1984.

C. Johnson & Son, Inc. (commonly referred to as S. C. Johnson) is an American multinational privately held manufacturer of household cleaning supplies and other consumer chemicals based in Racine, Wisconsin. In 2017, S. C. Johnson employed approximately 13,000 people and had estimated sales of $10 billion. The company is owned by the Johnson family. H. Fisk Johnson, Chairman and CEO since 2004, is the fifth generation of the Johnson family to lead the company.  History  The company is one of the oldest family-owned businesses in the U.S, beginning in 1886 when Samuel Curtis Johnson purchased the parquet flooring division from the Racine Hardware Manufacturing Company and named the new business S. C. Johnson. The company‚Äôs principal product at that time was parquet flooring, later adding other floor care products like Johnson‚Äôs Prepared Wax, Johnson‚Äôs Dance Wax and Johnson‚Äôs Wood Dye. Under Herbert Fisk Johnson Sr., the company expanded worldwide, establishing its first subsidiary in the United Kingdom in 1914. Giving his employees credit for a successful year, Herbert gave them $35,000 in 1917. In 1932, SC Johnson introduced Johnson‚Äôs Glo-Coat. The success of Glo-Coat bolstered the company during the Great Depression. S. C. Johnson‚Äôs line of wax-reliant products necessitated Herbert Fisk Johnson Jr.‚Äôs 1935 expedition to Fortaleza, Brazil to find a direct sustainable source of wax. From April 1935 until May 1950, the company was the sponsor for the Fibber McGee and Molly radio show, officially known as The Johnson Wax Program. During the 1950s, the company served as sponsor of the game show, The Name's the Same. The company went on to co-sponsor Robert Montgomery Presents on NBC, and The Red Skelton Show on CBS. In April of 1939, the Frank Lloyd Wright‚Äìdesigned SC Johnson Administration Building opened. Its addition, the Research Tower, opened in 1950. The SC Johnson Headquarters was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1974. The launch of Raid House & Garden Bug Killer in 1955 marked the company‚Äôs first major departure away from wax-based products. Within the next few years, Sam Johnson, fourth generation leader, introduced some of the company‚Äôs best known: Glade, OFF! and Pledge. In April 2018, the company updated its tagline from \\"A Family Company\\", which began in 1998, to \\"A Family Company at Work for a Better World\\". According to the company, the updated tagline is \\"A reminder that SC Johnson holds itself to a higher standard.\\" Racine Hardware Manufacturing Advertisement, \\"The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine,\\" November 1889 =Acquisition milestones= * In 1992, the company bought Drackett, manufacturer of Windex, DrƒÅno and other specialty cleaning products. * In 1998, S.

Johnson & Son's Greenlist process is a classification system that evaluates the effects of raw materials on human health and the environment. The Greenlist logo represents an internal ratings system to help customers identify which products are environmentally safe. The Greenlist label is present in many S. C. Johnson & Son products. The Greenlist process has resulted in the elimination of 1.8 million pounds of volatile organic compounds from Windex, and four million pounds of polyvinylidene chloride from Saran Wrap. In 2011, S. C. Johnson & Son settled a lawsuit that alleged the company's Greenlist label misled consumers into believing the products were reviewed by a third party and given a seal of approval. The company agreed to an undisclosed sum and dropped the labeling of Greenlist on Windex. S. C. Johnson & Son is the main sponsor of the Serra das Almas Private Natural Heritage Reserve in the states of Cear√° and Piau√≠, Brazil. The reserve protects an area of the caatinga biome, including wild specimens of the carnauba palm tree (Copernicia prunifera), the source of carnauba wax. On December 18, 2012, S. C. Johnson & Son began operation of two wind turbines at their largest manufacturing facility in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin. The turbines, in addition to the gas reclamation system in place at a nearby landfill, are estimated to produce enough electricity to completely power the facility. In 2017 S. C. Johnson purchased the ecological product Ecover and Method brands on undisclosed terms.  Controversy  A RICO lawsuit by tax whistleblower Mike DeGuelle alleges that since 1997, S. C. Johnson & Son has taken advantage of audit errors and filed fraudulent tax returns, underpaying its taxes by millions of dollars. H. Fisk Johnson ordered an inquiry into the allegations, and told Tax Analysts that he learned \\"other details of the decisions they (the tax department) made that I didn't like. I didn't like what I heard.\\" On December 15, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Case No. 10-2172, ruled that DeGuelle had alleged a valid claim that the company's discharge of him was part of the tax fraud scheme. DeGuelle's claim was reviewed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin with the Court ruling to dismiss the RICO lawsuit on the grounds of preclusion. The Court did not rule on SC Johnson‚Äôs actions as they pertain to tax evasion, with Judge Stadtmueller stating that \\"the legality of SC Johnson‚Äôs actions (and whether those actions did, in fact, occur) is of no importance to the Court‚Äôs consideration of the defendant‚Äôs motion for summary judgment.\\" The Wisconsin Court of Appeals reviewed DeGuelle's case and affirmed an earlier ruling of the Racine County Circuit Court in favor of SC Johnson for defamation related to Deguelle's claims of tax evasion and breach of a confidentiality agreement. S. C. Johnson & Son was fined by Autorit√© de la concurrence in France in 2016 for price-fixing on personal hygiene products.

This distinctive type of chant is a significant element of Anglican church music. Anglican chant was formerly in widespread use in Anglican and Episcopal churches, but today, Anglican chant is sung primarily in Anglican cathedrals and parish churches that have retained a choral liturgical tradition. Additionally, Anglican chant may be sung in Roman Catholic, Lutheran,Mayes, Benjamin T.G., English Chant Psalter (NKJ) (Ft. Wayne, Indiana: Concordia Theological Seminary Press, 2002), http://www.librarything.com/work/6011459. (Te Deum Presbyterian, and Reformed churches. Anglican chant grew out of the plainchant tradition during the English Reformation. When singing a text in Anglican chant, the natural rhythm of the words as they would be spoken by a careful speaker governs how the music is fitted to the words. The majority of the words are freely and rhythmically chanted over the reciting notes, which are found in the first, fourth, eighth, eleventh (etc.) bars of the chant and with the other notes of the music appropriately fitted to the words at the end of each half-verse. Formerly the rhythm of the non-reciting notes was strictly observed, but nowadays the rhythm is based on the natural cadence of speech. Thus, the length of each of these notes bears little relation to the normal musical value of a note such as a minim or semi-breve. Anglican chant was well established by the 18th century. The earliest known examples are single chants written by John Blow, Henry Purcell, and their contemporaries. Earlier examples by Tudor composers such as Tallis, Farrant, and others are not original. The earliest double chants are from about 1700. Method An Anglican chant with the chords in different colours The text is pointed for chanting by assigning each verse or phrase to a simple harmonised melody of 7, 14, 21 or 28 bars (known respectively as a single, double, triple or quadruple chant). An example of a single chant is shown above. Below are the first four verses of the Magnificat, with the text coloured to show which words correspond to which notes in the music (\\"the chant\\"). :1. My soul doth ' magnify the ' Lord : And my spirit hath re'joiced in ' God my ' Saviour. :2. For ' he hath re'garded : the ' lowliness ' of his ' handmaiden. :3. For be'hold from ' henceforth : all gene ' rations shall ' call me ' blessed. :4. For he that is mighty hath ' magnified ' me : and ' holy ' is his ' Name. Another example of the color-pointed text for chant scores is the Vox Barnabas Psalter, a collection of public domain double chant scores by St. Barnabas Chorus, used to sing their in-Chant-ed podcast of Morning and Even Song. Various psalters have been published over the years, with each one showing how the chant is to be fitted to the words and each having its own variation on the precise rules for doing so. The rules used in the Parish Psalter (one of the more popular psalters, edited by Sydney Nicholson) are as follows: * Each verse is sung to seven bars of music (the whole chant in the example above, though most chants are 14 bars = 2 verses long) * The bar lines in the music correspond to the \\"pointing marks\\" which are shown above as inverted commas or apostrophes in the text. * The double bar line in the music corresponds to the colon in the text. * Where there is one note (a semibreve) to a bar, all the words for the corresponding part of the text are sung to that one note. * Where there are two notes (two minims) to a bar, unless indicated otherwise all the words except the last syllable are sung to the first minim. The final syllable is sung to the second minim. Where more than the last syllable is to be sung to the second minim, a dot (¬∑) (between words) or a hyphen (within a word) is used in the text to indicate where the note change should occur. Other psalters use different notation; modern psalters such as the New St Paul's Cathedral Psalter (John Scott, 1997) have adopted the following convention: * A vertical bar (|) is used to indicate a barline. * Whenever there are 3 or more syllables in a bar containing two minims, a dot (¬∑) or hyphen is used, even if the change of note is on the final syllable. There are various additional rules which apply occasionally: * Some chants have more complicated rhythms than the example above, generally in the form of a dotted minim and a crotchet (in any bar except the last of a quarter) or of two crotchets taking the place of a minim. * When a minim in an internal bar (i.e. not the first or last bar of a quarter) is replaced by two crotchets, one of two things happens. If there is only one syllable, both notes are sung to it in quick succession. If there are two (or occasionally more) syllables, they are split as appropriate to smoothly match the rhythm of the words to the two notes. * When an internal bar has a dotted rhythm, it is to be sung as above, excepting that the crotchet can be omitted from the music if the natural rhythm of the words and the sentiment of the words indicate that it is appropriate to do so. * When the first bar of a quarter has a dotted minim and a crotchet, all syllables except the last are sung to the note of the dotted minim, with the crotchet being tucked in on the last syllable before the barline. If there is only one syllable, both notes are sung to it in quick succession with the subtle emphasis being on the first note. * Sometimes the last bar of a quarter has two minims instead of the usual semibreve, in which case a dot/hyphen may be required after the last barline in the text: (e.g. even as ' though they ' were mine ' ene-mies.) * Particularly in long psalms, changes of chant may be used to signal thematic shifts in the words. Psalm 119, which is the longest in the psalter, is generally sung with a change of chant after every 8 of its 176 verses, corresponding to the 22 stanzas of the original Hebrew text. However, it is never sung all at once, but spread over successive days. Double, triple and quadruple chants The example above is a single chant. This is mostly only used for very short psalms (half a dozen verses or so). The most commonly used chants are double chants. These are twice the length of a single chant. The music of the chant is repeated for every pair of verses. This reflects the structure of the Hebrew poetry of many of the psalms: Each verse is in two halves ‚Äì the second half answers the first; the verses are in pairs ‚Äì the second verse answers the first. Triple and quadruple chants are considerably rarer. They appeared from the latter part of the 19th century to cover some of the exceptions to this format. They set the verses of the psalm in groups of three or four verses respectively. Psalm 2 (for example) is suited to a triple chant; a quadruple chant might be used for Psalm 78. A double chant is divided into \\"quarters\\", each of which has the music for half a verse. Triple and quadruple chants may also be described as containing six or eight quarters. If the entire text (or a section of it) has an odd number of verses, the second half of the chant is usually repeated at an appropriate point, which may be marked \\"2nd part\\". Similarly, \\"3rd part\\" markings may be used for triple chants. An example of a double chant: A double Anglican Chant with the chords in different colours Below are the four lines of the doxology Gloria Patri (commonly known as the \\"Gloria\\"), with the text coloured to show which words correspond to which notes in the music (pointing varies from choir to choir): Glory be to the Father, and ' to the ' Son : and ' to the ' Holy ' Ghost; As it was in the beginning, is now, and ' ever ' shall be : world without ' end A ' - - ' men. The doxology Gloria Patri, usually sung at the end of a psalm or canticle, is two verses long. Depending on the type of chant, it is sung in one of the following ways: *to a single chant sung twice, *to a double chant, *to an appropriate 14 bars (usually specified by the composer) of a triple chant or quadruple chant. Accompaniment Psalms may be sung unaccompanied or accompanied by an organ or other instrument. Organists use a variety of registrations to mirror the changing mood of the words from verse to verse; but the organ should never be so loud that the words cannot be clearly heard. Organists may sometimes indulge in word painting, using effects such as a deep pedal note on the word \\"thunder\\", a harsh reed tone for \\"darkness\\" contrasting with a mixture for \\"light\\", or (more frivolously!) applying the Zymbelstern to the phrases \\"round about\\" (Ps 110:10), \\"fair ground\\" (Ps 16:7) and \\"sea saw\\" (Ps 114:3). Antiphonal singing A further stylistic technique is used in cathedrals and churches which use an antiphonal style of singing. In this case, the choir is divided into two equal half-choirs, each having representation for the four musical parts, and usually facing one another. They are typically named Decani (usually the half-choir to the south side) and Cantoris (usually the half- choir to the north side). Then the choir may employ either of the techniques known as quarter-chanting and half-chanting. In quarter-chanting (which is more true to the structure of the Hebrew poetry), the side that starts (usually decani) sing the first quarter of the chant (and thus the first half of the verse). The side that did not start (usually cantoris) then sing the second quarter of the chant (and thus the second half of the verse). This sequence then repeats. In half-chanting (which is more true to antiphonal singing in the Gregorian style), decani sing the first two quarters of the chant, and cantoris the next two quarters (so that each half-choir sings a whole verse at a time). With antiphonal singing, the first two verses, the Gloria and perhaps the last two verses are often sung by the whole choir. A few choirs elaborate further, e.g. by having some verses sung by soloists, trebles only, alto/tenor/bass only (with the treble line transferred into one of the other parts) or one part or soloists singing the melody while the rest of the choir hums. Occasionally some or all trebles may sing a descant; this usually happens only in the final verse of the psalm or the Gloria.

She is one of Finland's most-cherished modernist painters. She is most widely known for her realist works and self-portraits, and less well known for her landscapes and still lifes. Throughout her long life, her work changed dramatically beginning with French-influenced realism and plein air painting. It gradually evolved towards portraits and still life paintings. At the beginning of her career she often produced historical paintings, such as the Wounded Warrior in the Snow (1880), At the Door of Link√∂ping Jail in 1600 (1882) and The Death of Wilhelm von Schwerin (1886). Historical paintings were usually the realm of male painters, as was the experimentation with modern influences and French radical naturalism. As a result, her works produced mostly in the 1880s did not receive a favourable reception until later in her life. > Her work starts with a dazzlingly skilled, somewhat melancholic version of > late-19th-century academic realism‚Ä¶it ends with distilled, nearly abstract > images in which pure paint and cryptic description are held in perfect > balance. (Roberta Smith, New York Times, November 27th 1992) Schjerbeck's birthday, 10 July, is Finland's national day for the painted arts.  Early life  Young Schjerfbeck in 1880 Portrait photograph from 1881‚Äì1882 pension by Rue de Baigmeux in Montparnasse, 1881‚Äì1882 Helena Sofia Schjerfbeck was born on July 10, 1862, in Helsinki, Finland (then an autonomous Grand-Duchy within the Russian Empire), to Svante Schjerfbeck (an office manager) and Olga Johanna (n√©e Printz). She had one surviving brother, (1860-1933) who went on to become an architect. In 1866, when she was four she fell down some stairs injuring her hip, which prevented her from attending school and left her with a limp for the rest of her life. She showed talent at an early age, and, in 1873, by the time she was eleven she was enrolled at the Finnish Art Society School of Drawing. Her fees were paid by Adolf von Becker, who saw promise in her.Ahtola-Moorhouse, Lena: 'Schjerfbeck, Helene [Helena] (Sofia)' At this school Schjerfbeck met Helena Westermarck. These two, and artist Maria Wiik and lesser known Ada Thilen had a close friendship during their lives. When Schjerfbeck's father died of tuberculosis on February 2, 1876, Schjerfbeck's mother took in boarders so that they could get by. A little over a year after her father's death, Schjerfbeck graduated from the Finnish Art Society drawing school. She continued her education, with Westermarck, at a private academy run by Adolf von Becker, which utilised the University of Helsinki drawing studio. Professor paid for her tuition to Becker's private academy. There, Becker himself taught her French oil painting techniques. In 1879, at the age of 17, Schjerfbeck won third prize in a competition organised by the Finnish Art Society, and in 1880 her work was displayed in an annual Finnish Art Society exhibition. That summer Schjerfbeck spent time at a manor owned by her aunt on her mother's side, Selma Printz, and Selma's husband Thomas Adlercreutz. There she spent time drawing and painting her cousins. Schjerfbeck became particularly close to her cousin Selma Adlercreutz, who was her age. In 1880, she set off to Paris later that year after receiving a travel grant from the Imperial Russian Senate. Career =Paris= Self-Portrait, 1884 In Paris, Schjerfbeck painted with Helena Westermarck, then left to study with L√©on Bonnat at Mme Tr√©lat de Vigny's studio. In 1881 she moved to the Acad√©mie Colarossi, where she studied once again with Westermarck. The Imperial Senate gave her another scholarship, which she used to spend a couple of months in Meudon, and then a few more months in Pont-Aven a small fishing in Concarneau, Brittany. She then went back to the Acad√©mie Colarossi briefly, before returning to the in Finland. Schjerfbeck continued to move around frequently, painting and studying with various people. Schjerfbeck made money by continuing to put her paintings in the Art Society's exhibitions, and she also did illustrations for books. After returning to Finland in 1882, in 1884 she was back in Paris at the Acad√©mie Colarossi with Westermarck, but this time they were working there. During this time she participated in Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts‚Äô The Salon and painted again in Brittany. In the chapel of Tr√®molo near the village of Pont-Aven Schjerfbeck produced the painting The Door (1884). =Engagement and travels= During late Autumn 1883, Schjerfbeck got engaged to an unknown painter. According to 's investigations and research, the fianc√© was a Swedish painter Otto Hagborg who also lived in Pont-Aven in the winter and spring of 1883‚Äì1884. The engagement, however, came to an end in 1885 when a problem with Schjerfbeck's hip led the groom's family to suspect tuberculosis. In reality the issue was a result of her fall during childhood. Schjerfbeck never married. After spending a year in Finland, Schjerfbeck travelled again to Paris in the autumn of 1886. Schjerfbeck was given more money to travel by a man from the Finnish Art Society and in 1887 she travelled to St Ives, Cornwall, in Britain. There she painted The Bakery (1887) and The Convalescent, the latter winning the bronze medal at the 1889 Paris World Fair. The painting was later bought by the Finnish Art Society. During this period Schjerfbeck was painting in a naturalistic plein-air style. =Teaching and sanatorium= Self-Portrait, 1895 Self-Portrait, 1912 In the 1890s Schjerfbeck started teaching regularly in Finland at the Art Society drawing school, now the Academy of Fine Arts. Hilda Flodin was one of her students. However, in 1901 she became too ill to teach and in 1902 she resigned from her post. She moved to Hyvink√§√§, which was known for its sanatorium, all while taking care of her mother who lived with her (the mother died in 1923). While living in Hyvink√§√§, she continued to paint and exhibit. \\"Schjerfbeck‚Äôs sole contact with the art world was through magazines sent by friends.\\"Facos, Michelle. 'Helene Schjerfbeck‚Äôs Self-Portraits', in Woman‚Äôs Art Journal; 16 (Spring 1995): 12-7. Since she did not have art, Schjerfbeck took up hobbies like reading and embroidery. During this time Schjerbeck produced still lifes and landscapes, as well as portraits, such as that of her mother, local school girls and women workers, and also self-portraits, and she became a modernist painter. Her work has been compared to that of artists such as James McNeill Whistler and Edvard Munch, but from 1905 her paintings took on a character that was hers alone. She continued experimenting with various techniques such as using different types of underpainting. =Exhibitions= fi) Self- Portrait with Silver Background, 1915 Unfinished Portrait, 1921 (slashed over by the artist) In 1913 Schjerfbeck met the art-dealer , with whose encouragement she exhibited at Malm√∂ in 1914, Stockholm in 1916 and St Petersburg in 1917. In 1917 Stenman organised her first solo exhibition and in that year (alias H. Ahtela) published the first Schjerfbeck monograph. Later she exhibited at Copenhagen (1919), Gothenburg (1923) and Stockholm (1934). In 1937 Stenman organised another solo exhibition for her in Stockholm, and in 1938 he began paying her a monthly stipend. Her paintings were successfully displayed in several exhibitions in Sweden in the 1930s and 1940s.  Later years and death  As the years passed, Schjerfbeck travelled less. When a family matter arose, such as a death, she would travel back to her home city of Helsinki and she spent most of 1920 in Eken√§s, but by 1921 she was back living in Hyvink√§√§. For about a year, Schjerfbeck moved to a farm in Tenala to get away from the Winter War, but went back to Eken√§s in the middle of 1940. She later moved into a nursing home, where she resided for less than a year before moving to the Luontola sanatorium. In 1944 she moved into the Saltsj√∂baden spa hotel in Sweden, where she continued to paint actively even during her last years; e.g. the series of self-portraits. She died on January 23, 1946 and was buried at the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.  Work  fi) Dancing Shoes is one of Schjerfbeck's most enduringly popular paintings. The subject was so popular that Schjerfbeck returned to the theme three times as well as executing a lithograph of it, the latter catapulting the painting to international fame. It depicts her cousin Esther Lupander. Esther had extremely long legs and for that reason the painting was nicknamed \\"The Grasshopper\\". Executed in Realist style, the painting shows the clear influence of Schjerfbeck's stay in Paris where she had expressed admiration for Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Berthe Morisot, and Mary Cassatt. It fetched ¬£3,044,500 at a 2008 Sotheby's London sale. Girl with Blonde Hair (1916) is an example of Schjerfbeck's mature style, drawing on French Modernism. The work belongs to a series (including also The Family Heirloom of the same year) featuring neighbours of Schjerfbeck, Jenny and Impi Tamlander, who ran errands for Schjerfbeck and her mother and helped look after the family home. Here the sitter is Impi. The painting realized ¬£869,000 at a 2015 Sotheby's London sale. Schjerfbeck was included in the 2018 exhibit Women in Paris 1850-1900. Legacy Art forger was an admirer of hers and writes of his time forging Schjerfbeck's works: \\"By encroaching on Schjerfbeck I felt like I had violated something sacred. It was if I had broken into a sacristy to steal the church silvers.\\" Fellow forger and self-admitted seller of 60 Schjerfbeck counterfeits Jouni Ranta was more critical and opined her fame was undeserved. =Exhibitions= *From 20 July to 27 October 2019, Royal Academy set up an exhibition with over 60 paintings, landscapes and still lifes, remarking the evolution of her career.

It is one of three original trusts set up by Joseph Rowntree in 1904. The Trust supports work in five programme areas: peace and security, rights and justice, power and accountability, sustainable future and Northern Ireland. History In 1904, the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust (JRCT), along with sister organisations the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, were created by Joseph Rowntree, who gave about a half of his wealth to establish them. The original trustees of the JRCT were: Rowntree, his sons John Wilhelm, Benjamin Seebohm, Joseph Stephenson and Oscar Frederick, and his nephew Arnold Stephenson Rowntree. The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust‚Äôs values are rooted in Quakerism. Joseph Rowntree, who was a Quaker, believed that it is only possible to make a lasting difference by addressing the root causes of a social or economic problem. Quaker values include peace, equality, simplicity, integrity and stewardship of the earth. Current day The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust describes itself as \\"a Quaker trust which seeks to transform the world by supporting people who address the root causes of conflict and injustice.\\" The Trust says that in order to engage in philanthropy that effects real change, ‚ÄúJRCT does not shy away from supporting those working on unpopular or contentious issues‚Äù. It also believes that change can ‚Äútake many years to achieve‚Äù. The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust offers grants to around 100 different charitable organisations a year. In 2018 these included Reprieve, Fawcett Society, Operation Black Vote and Fair Tax Mark. It makes grants in excess of ¬£10 million a year. =Cage controversy= The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust said it works to ‚Äústrengthen the hands of those leading change‚Äù and recognises that such work carries a level of risk. Between 2007 and 2011, the trust gave three grants to CAGE, formerly known as Cageprisoners, described as a \\"controversial Islamic rights group\\", totalling ¬£305,000, to support the work of Moazzam Begg. Cage describes itself as \\"an independent organisation working to empower communities impacted by the War on Terror\\" and has spoken out against the UK's anti-terrorism laws. CAGE spokesman Asim Qureshi called on Muslims to support jihad at an extremist rally, and described militant Mohammed Emwazi, as a \\"beautiful young man\\". Lord Carlile, formerly the British Government‚Äôs independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, said: \\"I would never advise anybody to give money to CagePrisoners. I have concerns about the group. There are civil liberty organisations which I do give money to but CagePrisoners is most certainly not one of them.\\" Speaking in 2015, the human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith defended the \\"vital\\" work of Cage and denied they are apologists for terrorism. He said: \\"They do important work and the UK authorities need to understand that alienating moderate Muslims is the worst thing that could possibly be done at this time. I myself represent those said to be 'terrorists' and since Magna Carta, in 1215, we have presumed people innocent rather than guilty‚Ä¶it is clear beyond dispute that when we jettison our principles we make ourselves hypocrites and hypocrisy is the yeast that ferments extremism.\\" =Ethical investment= The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust invests its endowment sustainably and responsibly. The Trust has divested from fossil fuel extractive companies. In 2019 it was among a coalition of 20 charities which asked the attorney-general and the Charity Commission for England and Wales to seek a ruling on whether the public benefit of charities means they should be required to align their investment policies with their own objectives and commitments to wider society. In September 2019, JRCT was named a ‚Äúglobal leader‚Äù by the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment for its commitment to ethical and responsible investment. The global leader group also included the Church Commissioners for England and the Environmental Agency Pension Fund.

Joseph was a visionary Quaker businessman and social reformer. Watching his father set-up a York soup kitchen in the mid-1800s helped Joseph to realise that such actions were not comprehensive enough. This led to a shift in the Rowntrees‚Äô social action, from treating the symptoms to addressing the root causes of poverty. Joseph gave away half of his own fortune to set up various trusts; he was committed to understanding the causes of poverty and disadvantage in order to create a better society. He built New Earswick, a village in York, for people on low incomes, giving them access to decent homes at affordable rents. Joseph‚Äôs son, Seebohm Rowntree, was also a pioneering social researcher who undertook one of the country‚Äôs first investigations into poverty. Poverty, A Study of Town Life influenced the Liberal Government‚Äôs introduction of Old Age Pensions (1908) and National Insurance (1911) as a means of protecting people from insecurity. His further studies of York (in 1936 and 1951) demonstrated the increasing effectiveness of welfare measures in anchoring the citizens of York in times of hardship. Seebohm Rowntree‚Äôs surveys were pivotal in a line of intellectual thinking that ended with Beveridge‚Äôs Welfare State. In addition his book, The Human Factor in Business (1921), set a standard for various workplace provisions; from pension schemes and industrial regulations to employee education and work‚Äôs councils. Such progressive measures led to him becoming an advisor to the Liberal PM David Lloyd George during the First World War. Seebohm helped to design welfare boards in the new state-owned munitions factories. Both Joseph and Seebohm Rowntree had a clear vision about how to improve people's lives. Joseph outlined these ideas in his 'Founder's Memorandum' - a blueprint for his early charitable work. Although it was written in 1904, many of its aims remain at the heart of JRF‚Äôs mission today: carrying out social research, and working to influence society and policy through robust evidence and communication.

At the 1979 European Parliament election he was elected as an MEP for the Munster constituency. He did not contest the 1981 general election so as to concentrate his time as an MEP. However, he lost his seat at the European Parliament at the 1984 European Parliament election. Davern was again elected to D√°il √âireann at the 1987 general election, and came to national prominence in 1991 when he was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister for Education. This was in the wake of Albert Reynolds and P√°draig Flynn's failed attempt to oust Charles Haughey as Taoiseach. Davern's stay in government was short-lived because Reynolds became Taoiseach in early 1992 and he was again sent to the backbenches. In 1995, he became Opposition Spokesman on European Affairs when Bertie Ahern named his new front bench. Fianna F√°il were returned to government and Davern became Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food. He served in that position until 2002. Davern was one of only three Members of the 29th D√°il who had first been elected in the 1960s, the others being S√©amus Pattison, elected at the 1961 general election and Michael Smith, also elected at the 1969 general election. He died on 27 October 2013.

The confusion arises because the mile marker at the beginning of the trail in Bedford is 1 instead of 0. Wikipedia editors have measured the distance as shown on maps and in Google Earth, and it appears to be 10 miles to within a few hundredths of a mile. For further verification, see: Project for Public Spaces or About the Lexington Branch paved multi-use rail trail located in the Greater Boston area of Massachusetts. It runs from Bedford to Alewife station, at the northern end of the Red Line in Cambridge, passing through the towns of Lexington and Arlington along the way. Also along the route are several notable regional sites, including Alewife Brook Reservation, Spy Pond, \\"Arlington‚Äôs Great Meadows\\" (actually located in Lexington), the Battle Green in Lexington, and Hanscom Air Force Base. At its Cambridge terminus, the bikeway connects with four other bike paths: *the Fitchburg Cutoff Path *the Cambridge Linear Park which, in turn, leads to the Somerville Community Path. *the Alewife Brook Greenway, a connection to the Mystic River bike path, following Alewife Brook. The Alewife Brook extension received $4M from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 as the \\"Minuteman Bikepath Connector\\" project. * a sidewalk path to Fresh Pond Reservation. Plans are underway to extend the Somerville Community Path to downtown Boston, which would create a much larger continuous bikeway accessible from the Minuteman. At the Bedford end, the Minuteman Bikeway connects with the Narrow Gauge Rail Trail and the Reformatory Branch Rail Trail.  History  Map from 1946, where Boston & Maine Railroad (B&M;) passes along the route of today's Minuteman Bikeway The path comprising the current Minuteman Bikeway has a long history. The trail closely approximates the route that Paul Revere took on his famous ride in 1775, which heralded the beginning of the American Revolution. Along the way to becoming a railroad, the path's right-of-way was laid out east of Lexington in 1846 by the Lexington and West Cambridge Railroad and west of Lexington in 1873 by the Middlesex Central Railroad. Railbanking of the line was first proposed in 1974, three years before passenger rail service was discontinued, and a full seven years before rail service was discontinued altogether (in 1981). In 1991, the final plan for the conversion was approved, and construction started on the original section of the bikeway. The Arlington‚ÄìLexington section of the path was dedicated in September 1992; the Lexington‚ÄìBedford segment was delayed by water main construction and opened in May 1993. (second page) In 1998, the bikeway was extended a short distance from East Arlington to Alewife station in Cambridge. In 2002 it was repaved in Arlington and in 2004 the Bedford Depot Park Enhancement Project was completed at its western terminus.Viser, Matt (2007), \\"Rage on the bikeway\\", The Boston Globe, Volume 272, Number 1, 2007-07-01, p.A1. In 2008, the bikeway was the fifth inductee into the national Rail-Trail Hall of Fame by the Rails-to- Trails Conservancy. The property is currently owned by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and leased to the municipalities through which it passes on an interim basis. The MBTA at one point planned to use this right- of-way to extend the Red Line to Arlington Center and Arlington Heights. Beginning in Spring 2015, the crossing of the path through Arlington Center is expected to be rebuilt to be less discontinuous.Map of Preferred Alternative - Arlington Center Safe Travel Project, March 21, 2013 Uses Area residents use the bikeway for a host of activities, including bicycling, walking, jogging, and inline skating. The main use of the path, however, is for casual biking. In the winter there is often enough snow on the bikeway for cross- country skiing. However, it is now plowed from Alewife Station to Bedford. No motorized vehicles are allowed except for powered wheelchairs and emergency vehicles. Future possibilities New connections under contemplation include one from Lexington to the Battle Road Trail and one to the Charles River bike path via Fresh Pond Reservation and the abandoned Watertown Branch Railroad. A portion of the latter path, at the Watertown end, has been completed and design work on the remaining section to Cambridge is expected to be finished in 2016. In April 2014, state officials announced that the Somerville Community Path would be extended alongside the Green Line Extension, creating a continuous 4.5 mile route from the Minuteman Bikeway to Boston‚Äôs Charles River Bike Path. Officials had contemplated abandoning the path portion of the GLX in order to save costs, but after hiring new management, a contractor agreed to the parallel path while still cutting costs.

History Probably built around 1781, it was named Stocks Mill after the village stocks that stood nearby. The mill may be older and may have been moved from Stone in Oxney, with the date 1781 carved into the main post denoting its re-erection. The Mill House was at one time used as the parish Poorhouse. The mill was last worked circa 1900, and was then preserved by Norman Forbes-Robertson, who owned the mill and Mill House. The mill passed into the ownership of the artist Randolph H Sauter. and then Sir Edward Parry. The mill was repaired in 1958, and in 1968 a new stock and pair of sails was fitted by the millwright Derek Ogden. In 1980, the mill was acquired by Kent County Council and the Friends of Stocks Mill was set up to allow the mill to be opened to the public. The mill underwent a restoration programme starting in 2002 and partly funded by the National Lottery, which included two new sails amongst other work. Some of the milling machinery which had been removed over the years was recreated. The mill was reopened to the public in 2004. Description The head stones. Note that the head wheel has been converted from compass arm to clasp arm construction. Stocks Mill is a post mill on a single storey roundhouse. It has four Spring sails mounted on a wooden windshaft with a cast iron poll end. This carries a diameter wooden Head Wheel with 120 cogs, and a diameter Tail Wheel. The mill drove two pairs of millstones.

Although the area has been populated since the Bronze Age, the first recorded settlement dated back to the 13th century to Sacristan's Heugh. According to old maps it was once known as \\"Segerston Heugh\\" and is now known to local people as \\"Segga\\". This farm and manor house was once the residence of the Sacristan, a monk who held the Office of the Sacristan of the monastery at Durham Cathedral. The Sacristan was responsible for providing everything necessary for the services of the Cathedral: bread and wine, the vestments etc. He was also responsible for repairs to Durham Cathedral. The funds for carrying out the official duties were generated from the estate of Sacristan's Heugh which was finally demolished shortly after World War II. H Mining History Sacriston Colliery shaft was sunk in 1838 and by the 1890s the pit employed 600 men, producing 1,000 tons of coal a day. =Disaster of 1903= On Monday 16 November 1903, water flooded into the 3rd West district of the 'Busty' Seam. The inrush killed two miners: John Whittaker (25) and Thomas McCormick (52). McCormick family tradition (source Harry McCormick) is that Thomas McCormick's son Gregory had to be restrained from rushing into the flood. When the workings were pumped out another man, Robert Richardson was found on Friday standing on his coal tub having been stranded in the dark, surrounded by dirty flood water for 92 hours. > \\"The inquest was opened by Mr. Coroner Graham on the 20th November and > adjourned till the 9th December when evidence was taken, and the jury > returned a verdict that the two men were accidentally drowned, and that, > owing to the peculiar circumstances, no blame attached to the management.\\" The Royal Humane Society awarded their silver medal to six mine officials.1903 Mines Inspectors Report (Cd 2119), Durham District (No. 4) by R. D. Bain, H.M. Inspector of Mines, Page 22 available at Durham University Library. The enquiry lasted just five hours. See the Durham County Advertiser news report. There is a photograph of a contemporary souvenir at https://www.flickr.com/photos/greg_mccormick/8818617256/ Durham Mining Museum has further information, for instance at http://www.dmm.org.uk/individ1/i11353.htm Miners themselves have not all been convinced that the management was innocent or that the medals were appropriate. There have been suggestions that cover-ups were commonplace.http://www.durhamintime.org.uk/Durham_Miner/Sacriston_Colliery.pdf Decades later workers stumbled on the skeleton of one of the pit ponies that died during the accident and a full tub of coal that still bore a miners token (miners were on piece work). The miner then received his back pay. =Disaster of 1941= On 4 December 1941, a fall of stone on one of the work areas killed 5 miners they were: ::::Joseph Welsh, 46 ::::George W. Scott, 39 ::::William Richardson, 50 ::::William Smith, 40 ::::John William Britton, 47 =Decline and eradication of mining= As a result of the exhaustion of thick coal seams, only 1,500 tons of best quality coal was being produced a week in 1979. The last coal production was on 15 November 1985 and the colliery closed on 28 December 1985. As in many mining areas, the loss of the 'pit' led to significant unemployment and related social problems. Sacriston narrowly avoided D classification in 1985 due to social deprivation and general poor quality of housing. Little evidence of the mining operations now remains, with the area around the former coal mine having been landscaped and turned into woodland. A few mining-related buildings do survive, the largest of which is now used as a depot for the local authority's refuse vehicles, while the foundations of demolished mine buildings can be seen in places in the new woodland. Sacriston Wood is now a local nature reserve. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. The total population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 6,613. Life in Sacriston today More than 25 years after the closure of its last coal mine, the village retains a strong sense of community. Recently, a new community centre has opened, and the village has started to shake off its coal mining past. The village has a Travel Agent and a Post Office along with a large number of shops for a village of its size, including a Tesco Express, two other mini-marts, a greengrocer, newsagent, barbershop, off-licence many takeaway shops and others. There are also a two social clubs and similar organisations including Sacriston Working Mens Club and a Roman Catholic (now closed), cricket club and one remaining public house, 'Crossroads Inn'. The other pubs, 'The Village Inn', 'The Daisy Hill', 'The George and Dragon' and 'The Robin Hood', are now closed. Education The village has three schools, one of which is a Roman Catholic primary school, Sacriston Academy and Fyndoune Community College, a secondary school. Sacriston Primary School Sacriston Primary School opened on 1 September 2014 when, after a public consultation, the junior school closed and the infant school extended their age range and changed their name to Sacriston Primary School. Public Services A new health centre, which includes a dental practice as well as a GP surgery, was officially opened by Sir Bobby Robson in 2008. This facility was constructed on the site of the village's former swimming baths, which closed in the 1990s. In July 2009 the Northern Integrative Health Practice (NIHP Sacriston Practice) opened in the vacated GP surgery building on Sacriston Crossroads. Offering services that complement traditional healthcare, the newly renovated building will also include an out-patients centre for Sunderland Eye Infirmary from January 2010.

Modern Anglican liturgy has largely reverted to the order of the Roman Catholic Mass. Unlike masses written in the Catholic tradition, however, masses by Anglican composers may choose to omit the Credo, which, in Anglican churches, is often recited rather than sung. Also, rather than setting the traditional Latin and Greek liturgy, several Anglican-composed masses use an English translation, such as that contained within the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. Full service and other services A \\"Full Service\\" includes all three of these groups. But with the demise of daily \\"Matins\\" (choral morning prayer) from the Anglican liturgy and the reduction of the choral element in communion services composers are now more likely only to set the evening service. The \\"Burial Service\\" (see Requiem) is sometimes set separately. History In the Tudor and early Stuart periods, services were described as \\"Short\\", \\"Great\\" or \\"Verse\\" services: * Verse services incorporated sections for solo voices. * Short services were simple settings for four-part choir which could be sung a cappella. * Great Services (of which the most famous is the Great Service by William Byrd) were long and elaborate and presumably kept for special occasions. Following the Restoration this classification gradually broke down and services became known by the key in which they were written; hence the common shorthand terminology \\"Purcell in G minor\\" or \\"Stanford in B flat\\". From the twentieth century, compositions are often named after the college chapel or cathedral for which they were written: examples are the Collegium Magdalenae Oxoniense of Kenneth Leighton for Magdalen College, Oxford and the Gloucester Service of Herbert Howells for Gloucester Cathedral.

In the mid-1920s the Second Polish Republic established the Polish Military Transit Depot ( (WST) on the Westerplatte peninsula in the harbor of the Free City of Danzig. Beginning on 1 September 1939, the German Wehrmacht and Danzig Police assaulted the WST. Despite initial assessment on both sides that the Polish garrison might hold out for several hours before being reinforced or overwhelmed, the Poles held out for seven days and repelled thirteen assaults that included dive-bomber attacks and naval shelling. The defence of the Westerplatte was an inspiration for the Polish Army and people in the face of German advances elsewhere and is still regarded as a symbol of resistance in modern Poland. The Polish government is planning to open a dedicated public museum on the site in 2026. Background Westerplatte is a peninsula in the Bay of Gda≈Ñsk, in 1939 known as the Bay of Danzig. Following the re- establishment of Polish independence after World War I, much of the surrounding region became part of Poland. The city of Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk, Poland), historically an important port city, became an independent city- state, the Free City of Danzig. The Free City was nominally supervised by the League of Nations but Danzig became increasingly allied with Germany, reflecting its predominantly ethnic German population. In 1921, in the wake of the Polish-Soviet War, the League of Nations granted Poland the right to install a garrisoned ammunition depot near Danzig. Despite objections from the Free City, this right was confirmed in 1925, and an area of was selected on the Westerplatte peninsula. Westerplatte was separated from the New Port of Danzig mainly by the harbor channel; on land, the Polish-held part of Westerplatte was separated from Danzig's territory by a brick wall topped with barbed wire. A dedicated rail line, passing through the Free City, connected the depot with nearby Polish territory. The depot, referred to in League documents as the (WST) (), was completed in November 1925, officially transferred to Poland on the last day of that year, and became operational shortly after in January 1926, with 22 active storage warehouses. The Polish garrison's complement was set at 2 officers, 20 NCOs, privates to a total strength of 88 all ranks, and Poland was prohibited construction of further military installations or fortifications on the site. By early 1933, German politicians and media figures complained about the need for border adjustments. In addition, the Polish and French governments discussed the need for a preventive war against Germany. On 6 March, in what became known as the \\"Westerplatte incident\\" or \\"crisis\\", the Polish government landed a marine battalion on Westerplatte, briefly reinforcing the WST garrison to about 200 men, demonstrating Polish resolve to defend the depot; the Polish maneuver was also intended to put pressure on the Danzig government, which was trying to renounce a prior agreement on shared Danzig-Polish control over the harbor police and to acquire full control of the police and the harbor. According to one source, on 14 March 1933 the League had authorized Poland to reinforce its garrison. However, according to another, the additional Polish troops were withdrawn on 16 March, following protests from the League, Danzig, and Germany but only in exchange for Danzig's withdrawal of its objections to the harbor- police agreement. Later the Poles constructed clandestine fortifications on Westerplatte. These were relatively minor: there were no bunkers or tunnels, only several small guardhouses, partially hidden in the peninsula's forest and several more buildings in the middle of the peninsula, including barracks. Most buildings were constructed with reinforced concrete and were supported by a network of field fortifications, including trenches, barricades and barbed wire. Prelude In March 1939, a German ultimatum to Lithuania led to Germany's annexation of the nearby Lithuanian coastal Klaipƒóda region; subsequently, the Westerplatte garrison was placed on alert. Fearing a possible Nazi coup d'√©tat in Danzig, the Poles decided secretly to reinforce their garrison and resorted to a subterfuge, civilians in Polish Army uniform would leave the base, and new Polish soldiers would enter it. By late August 1939, the Poles had reinforced their 88-man garrison, though its strength is still debated; older sources speak of 182 men but more recent research suggests something in the range of 210 to 240, including six officers: Major Henryk Sucharski, his second-in-command Captain Franciszek DƒÖbrowski, Captain , Lieutenant , Lieutenant , and Second Lieutenant . Estimates include some 20 mobilized civilians and about 10 regular troops who happened to be on site when fighting began. In addition to light arms consisting of pistols, grenades, and about 160 rifles, weaponry included a 75 mm field gun wz. 1902/26, two Bofors 37 mm anti-tank guns, four 81 mm mortars, and about 40 machine guns, including 18 heavy ones. Field fortifications were extended: more trenches were dug, wooden barricades were built, barbed wire was strung into wire obstacles, and reinforced concrete shelters were built into the basements of the barracks. Foliage was thinned to reduce cover on expected avenues of attack. The Polish defense, which anticipated principally a German land-based assault, rested on three lines of defense. The outer line included entrenched outposts (codenamed Prom, Przysta≈Ñ, ≈Åazienki and Wa≈Ç) which were to hold long enough for the garrison to mobilize. The second line of defense centered on five guardhouses (numbered I to V) in the center of the depot. The final defense comprised the headquarters and barracks at the depot's center (sometimes referred to as Guardhouse VI). In addition, Poles also had several supporting positions (Elektrownia, Deika, Fort, Tor kolejowy and Kej). The plan called for the garrison to hold out for 12 hours, after which the siege was expected to be lifted by reinforcements arriving from the mainland. On 25 August 1939 the German pre-dreadnought battleship , under the pretext of making a courtesy call, sailed into Danzig harbor, anchoring from Westerplatte. On board was a Marinestosstruppkompanie (marine shock-troop company) of 225 marines under Lieutenant Wilhelm Henningsen. On land the Germans had the SS Heimwehr Danzig force of 1,500 men under Police General Friedrich-Georg Eberhardt. In overall command was Captain Gustav Kleikamp, aboard Schleswig-Holstein. Initially the marines were ordered to attack on the morning of 26 August 1939, on that day Kleikamp moved the battleship farther upstream, and as a result, Sucharski put his garrison on heightened alert. Shortly before the German disembarkation, the orders were rescinded as Adolf Hitler had postponed hostilities on learning of the Polish-British Common Defence Pact, signed the day before, on 25 August 1939, and that Italy was hesitant about its obligations under the Pact of Steel. Neither Eberhardt nor Kleikamp had specific information on the Polish defenses. The Germans assumed that preliminary bombardment would soften up the fortifications enough for the marines to capture Westerplatte. Reportedly Kleikamp had been assured by the Danzig Police that \\"Westerplatte would be taken in 10 minutes.\\" Eberhardt himself was more cautious, estimating that \\"a few hours\\" would be needed to overcome the Polish garrison, which the Germans estimated at no more than 100 men. Battle Map of the battle On the early morning of 1 September 1939, Schleswig-Holstein suddenly fired a broadside at the Polish garrison. That salvo's time has been variously stated as 04:45, 04:47, or 04:48. Polish historian Jaros≈Çaw Tuliszka explains that 04:45 was the planned time, 04:47 was the time the order was given by Kleikamp and 04:48 was the time the guns actually fired. Shortly after, on Westerplatte, Sucharski radioed the nearby Polish military base on the Hel Peninsula, \\"SOS: I'm under fire.\\" The battleship's bombardment was not very successful, failing to inflict a single casualty among the defenders, as due to the battleships proximity to its target its heavier shells did not have time to arm and did not explode upon impact. Eight minutes later Henningsen's marines from the Schleswig-Holstein, who had disembarked two hours earlier on the eastern side of the peninsula, advanced, expecting an easy victory over the Poles. However, soon after crossing the artillery-breached brick wall at the border, after advancing about 200 m and engaging the Polish Prom outpost, the Germans ran into an ambush. They found themselves in a kill zone of Polish crossfire from concealed firing positions, while barbed-wire entanglements impeded their movements. Around 05:15, the field gun, commanded by PajƒÖk, opened intense fire on the advancing Germans, firing 28 rounds, knocking out several machine- gun nests atop warehouses across the harbor canal, before it was destroyed by the battleship's guns during the second wave of bombardment three hours later. Meanwhile, the German infantry was also shelled by the Polish mortars, and even the battleship itself was targeted by the Polish 37 mm guns. Around that time the Poles also repulsed an attempt by a small maritime unit of the Danzig Police to land on the western side of the depot. In that initial engagement, Poles sustained two casualties, and a Polish soldier, Staff Sergeant Wojciech Najsarek, was killed by machine-gun fire. Najsarek has been described as the first Polish combat casualty of the battle and perhaps of the war. At 06:22 the German marines frantically radioed the battleship that they had sustained heavy losses and were withdrawing. Casualties were approximately 50 Germans and eight Poles, mostly wounded. A longer bombardment from the battleship, lasting from 07:40 to 08:55, preceded a second attack and succeeded at knocking out the Polish field gun. The Germans assaulted again from 08:35 to 12:30 but encountered mines, felled trees, barbed wire and intense fire. By noon, when the Germans retreated, Henningsen has been gravely wounded. Eberhardt requested air support, but it was delayed due to bad weather over Westerplatte. On the first day's combat, the Polish side had sustained four killed and several wounded. The German marines had lost 16 killed and some 120 wounded. The German commanders concluded that a ground attack was not feasible until the Polish defenses had been softened up. Re-examining aerial photographs, where they had previously underestimated the Polish defenses, they now overestimated them, concluding the Poles had constructed extensive underground and armored fortifications (six haystacks were declared to be armored bunker domes). In the following days, the Germans bombarded the Westerplatte peninsula with naval and heavy field artillery, including a 105 mm howitzer battery and 210 mm howitzers. On 2 September, from 18:05 to 18:25, a two-wave air raid by 60 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers dropped 26.5 tons of bombs, eliminating the Polish mortars, destroying Guardhouse V with a 500 kg bomb and killing at least eight Polish soldiers. The air raid shrouded all of Westerplatte in clouds of smoke and destroyed the Poles' only radio and much of their food supply. According to some German sources, after the air raid the Poles briefly displayed a white flag; but not all historians are convinced of this, and the German observers may have been mistaken. On 4 September, a German torpedo boat, T196, supported by an old minesweeper, the Von der Gronen (formerly ), made a surprise attack from the sea side. The Poles' Wa≈Ç outpost had been abandoned. Now only the Fort outpost prevented an attack from the north. Though the Poles never landed a hit on the German naval units, T196 and Schleswig-Holstein suffered accidents due to crew error or equipment failure, with at least one fatality and several injured men on the battleship. On 5 September Sucharski held a conference with his officers, during which he urged surrender: the post had only been supposed to hold out for twelve hours. His deputy, DƒÖbrowski, opposed surrender and the group decided to hold out a while longer. Subsequently, the Poles repelled several cautious German probing attacks. At 03:00 on 6 September, during one of the attacks, the Germans sent a burning train toward the Polish positions, but the ploy failed when the terrified driver decoupled prematurely. The train failed to reach the oil cistern; instead, it set fire to the woods, which had provided the Poles with valuable cover. In addition, the burning wagons created a perfect field of fire; the Germans suffered heavy losses. A second fire-train attack, in the afternoon, likewise failed. German soldiers on Westerplatte, 8 September, after the battle At a second conference with his officers, on 6 September, Sucharski was again ready to surrender: the German Army was by now outside Warsaw, and Westerplatte was running critically low on supplies; moreover, many of the wounded were suffering from gangrene. At 04:30 on 7 September the Germans opened intense fire on Westerplatte which lasted till 07:00. Flamethrowers and bombardment destroyed Guardhouse II and damaged Guardhouses I and IV. Schleswig-Holstein took part in the bombardments. At 09:45 on 7 September 1939 a white flag appeared. The Polish defense had so impressed the Germans that their commander, Eberhardt, initially let Sucharski keep his ceremonial szabla (Polish saber) in captivity although it would be confiscated later. Contemporary English-language publications which reported on the event, such as Life and the Pictorial History of the War, misidentified the Polish commander as a Major \\"Koscianski\\". Sucharski surrendered the post to Kleikamp, and the Germans stood at attention as the Polish garrison marched out at 11:30. Over 3,000 Germans, including soldiers and support formations such as the Danzig Police, had been tied up in the week-long operation against the small Polish garrison; about half of the Germans (570 on land, over 900 at sea) had taken part in direct action. German casualties totaled 50 killed (16 from the Kriegsmarine) and 150 wounded. The Poles had lost 15 men and had sustained at least 40 wounded. Aftermath German war flag being raised on Westerplatte, 8 September 1939 On 8 September, the day after the capitulation, the Germans discovered a grave with the bodies of four unidentified Polish soldiers who had been executed by their comrades for attempted desertion. This had likely taken place following the 2 September air raids. Five days after the capitulation, on 12 September 1939, the Polish wireless operator, Sergeant Kazimierz Rasi≈Ñski, was murdered by the Germans. He was shot after brutal interrogation during which he refused to hand over radio codes. On 19 September Hitler came to visit Danzig. While there, on 21 September, he inspected Westerplatte. Westerplatte saw another round of fighting during the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive in 1945. From 28 March to 1 April elements of the German 73rd Infantry Division defended the peninsula from the Soviet 76th Guards Rifle Division until the German units were evacuated by sea.  Significance  Ruins of Westerplatte barracks, 2005 A Polish naval officer delivering an address during the 79th anniversary of the Battle of Westerplatte in 2018. The Battle of Westerplatte is often described as the opening battle of World War II, but it was only one of many battles in the first phase of the German invasion of Poland known as the Battle of the Border. British historian I. C. B. Dear described the Schleswig-Holstein's salvos as having occurred \\"minutes after Luftwaffe attacks on Polish airfields\\" and other targets. A bridge in nearby Tczew had been bombed around 04:30, and the false-flag Operation Himmler had begun hours earlier. The Polish historian writes that \\"Westerplatte has become one of the symbols of the Polish struggle for independence, and is inscribed in the list of the most heroic battles of modern Europe.\\" For both sides the battle had mostly political, rather than tactical, importance. Still, it did tie up substantial German forces for much longer than anyone had expected, notably preventing Schleswig-Holstein from lending fire support in the nearby battles of Hel and Gdynia. Westerplatte's defense inspired the Polish Army and people even as German advances continued elsewhere; beginning on 1 September 1939, Polish Radio repeatedly broadcast the phrase that made Westerplatte an important symbol: \\"Westerplatte broni siƒô jeszcze\\" (\\"Westerplatte fights on\\"). On 16 September Konstanty Ildefons Ga≈Çczy≈Ñski penned a poem, ' (\\"A Song of the Soldiers of Westerplatte\\"), voicing a subsequent myth that all of Westerplatte's defenders had died in the battle, fighting to the last man. The battle became a symbol of resistance to the invasion ‚Äì a Polish Thermopylae. As early as 1943, a Polish People's Army unit was named for Westerplatte's soldiers (the Polish 1st Armoured Brigade of the Defenders of Westerplatte). That same year the Polish Underground State named a street after Westerplatte; and the following year, during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, an insurgent stronghold was named Westerplatte.  Controversy  Controversy surrounds the Polish garrison's commanding officer, Sucharski. Early historiography considered Sucharski to have been in command throughout the battle, and consequently early accounts portrayed him as a heroic figure. More recent accounts from the early 1990s have presented evidence that Sucharski's officers had vowed not to disclose in their lifetimes that their commander had been shell-shocked for most of the battle and had advocated surrender as early as 2 September, and several times thereafter; and that his second-in-command, DƒÖbrowski, had effectively taken command following Sucharski's breakdown on the second day of the siege. Sucharski's conduct is still debated by historians.  Remembrance  Westerplatte is a common venue for state remembrance ceremonies relating to World War II, usually held on 1 September. They are generally attended by high-ranking Polish politicians such as Prime Minister Donald Tusk (2014), President Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski (2015), President Andrzej Duda (2016), and Prime Minister Beata Szyd≈Ço (2017). The commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II, in 2009, was attended by Tusk, former Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, and former Presidents Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa and Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski, as well as by important figures from about 20 other countries, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, and French Prime Minister Fran√ßois Fillon. The Battle of Westerplatte has been the subject of two Polish films: Westerplatte (1967), and Tajemnica Westerplatte (The Secret of Westerplatte, 2013). It has also inspired dozens of books and scores of press articles, scholarly studies, and fictional works, as well as poems, songs, paintings, and other works of art. = Tourist attraction = The Polish 75 mm field gun became one of Germany's first war trophies of World War II, displayed on a column at Flensburg. After the war it was moved to stand before the Naval Academy M√ºrwik. Westerplatte Monument Westerplatte's Guardhouses I, III and IV, the power plant, and the barracks survived the war. In 1946 a and a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier were established on the peninsula; the cemetery was placed near the destroyed Guardhouse V. During the early postwar Stalinist era, Westerplatte was presented as a symbol of Poland's prewar anticommunist government and was marginalized in official history; Dr. Mieczys≈Çaw S≈Çaby, the garrison surgeon at Westerplatte, was arrested, tortured and died in the custody of the Ministry of Public Security in 1948. After the mid-1950s liberalization, Westerplatte was repurposed as a communist propaganda symbol; in 1956 the Polish Naval Academy was named for the \\"Heroes of Westerplatte\\", and that name began to be given to schools, streets, and other institutions. In 1962 a Christian cross at the cemetery was replaced with a Soviet T-34 tank, and the first government-organized remembrances began at Westerplatte. In 1966 a , also known as the \\"Historical Monument, Site of the Battle of Westerplatte\\", a 25-meter-tall obelisk atop a mound, was erected at Westerplatte, set within a park, with smaller installations. Westerplatte became a popular tourist attraction. Later Guardhouse I was relocated in order to save it from destruction during the construction of a new harbor channel. In 1971 Sucharski's grave was relocated to Westerplatte from his original burial place in Italy. In 1974 a small museum was opened in the renovated Guardhouse I. Since the 1980s Westerplatte has been administered by the National Museum in Gda≈Ñsk. In 1981 the cross was restored to the cemetery. In June 1987 Westerplatte was visited by Pope John Paul II; his visit is commemorated by a plaque unveiled in 2015. Following the fall of communism in Eastern and Central Europe, a change symbolic of Poland's political transformation was the 2007 transfer of the Soviet T-34 tank from the cemetery to a museum in another town. In 2001 the Polish government recognized Westerplatte's ruins as an object of cultural heritage.Official listing of objects of cultural heritage, NID (National Heritage Board of Poland) On 1 September 2003 the site was designated an official Historic Monument. In the mid-2010s the Polish government decided to create a dedicated , commemorating the 1939 battle; as of 2019 the museum was planned to be opened in 2026.

It was built in the 13th century and it is considered the oldest building in Haarlem, Netherlands.Beschrijving der Nederlanden, Volume 1 on Google books, page 86 It has served as a printshop for Coornhert, as a temporary council meeting location across from City Hall and even as a jail. It is located on the across from the St. Bavochurch. History fish market (today much smaller) enjoys the shade on the north side of the St. Bavochurch. By Pieter Jansz Saenredam in 1629 From 1250 to around 1350 the building served as the first city hall of Haarlem. After the current city hall was built across the square, various important families lived in the house. The lower part of the building was used as a printing shop, a general store and for storing beer. Though it had lost its official function, as a large and imposing building in medieval Haarlem, it continued to be used for council meetings whenever the Count of Holland was visiting. A plaque above the door states: This text in old Dutch says that whenever the Count \\"planted his court here on the sand\\" (meaning when he stayed in the large \\"Gravenzaal\\" or Count's hall across the square), this honorable building was put to use as the courthouse. The humanist Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert once ran a printshop from the basement in the 16th century. The baroque facade is newer and dates from circa 1650. On May 17, 1755 the building was bought by the municipality to serve as headquarters for the civic guard ('). This is the reason for the building's current name.Historic buildings , Haarlem marketing, accessed April 2013 Each evening and morning the gates of the city would be unlocked by the militia who lived here. Town Jail Until the Spaarne prison was built on the east side of the river (known as the ') in 1899, there were a few jail rooms upstairs here. Before 1755, prisoners were kept in the cellar of the city hall across the street, which was often quite damp, but open to the street level and allowed some exchange with townsfolk in the rear alleyway. After sentencing, prisoners received public humiliation though corporal punishment such as branding, eye gouging, or execution, but for minor crimes they were sent to the Tuchthuis, the local workhouse. Coornhert wrote the first treatise on criminals and pleaded for more humane treatment. The latter 17th century saw some reforms and a restriction in public executions, which came to be seen as barbaric. After 1755, keeping the prisoners upstairs significantly improved their living conditions, but it also saw a change in the purpose of their stay, as they had no contact anymore with the outside world. Before this change, prisoners were only held until sentencing, and their stay in jail was relatively short and not considered part of their punishment. With abolishment of public displays of corporal punishment, there was no solution for convicted felons that were not suited for the workhouse. For these prisoners, imprisonment became their punishment, but there was no longer any need to house them near the courthouse or near the Grote Markt. This building could not house longer term prisoners and thus the jail function was moved. Sentinel post For a short period the Hoofdwacht was in use as a military hospital, where Antonius Mathijsen made his discovery of the orthopedic plaster cast in 1851. The upstairs was also the place where the watchmen would stand guard near the balcony. The church opposite had a sentry lookout posted in the steeple who could signal the guards on the balcony using red flags so that the guards in the Hoofdwacht could react to fires or other unrest. This sentry position was still in use in 1919.

Groot Sionshofje in Leiden (Netherlands), 1860 A hofje is a Dutch word for a courtyard with almshouses around it. They have existed since the Middle Ages. A hofje provided housing for elderly people (mostly women). They were privately funded, and served as a form of social security. In the Netherlands there are still a number of hofjes in use. Hofjes are usually built in a U-shape with a yard or garden in the middle, and a gate as entrance. The shape of hofjes was most likely inspired by the (older) Begijnenhofjes -- groups of small houses inhabited exclusively by religious women. A distinction is usually made between the Begijnenhofjes and 'regular' hofjes. The former were used only by (Catholic) women, who were supporting themselves. They were a sort of cloister. The latter were more charitable institutions. To be eligible to live in a hofje one had to meet four criteria: * Sex: almost all hofjes were founded for women, as they could be relied on to keep a household running * Religion: many hofjes were founded for people of the same faith as the founder (some hofjes were founded by church communities) * Age: from the 17th century a minimum age was often used. Fifty years was common, and this was an old age in those years * Social-economic background: hofjes were targeted for poorer people In the 18th century there were hofjes founded for commercial purposes; the inhabitants would pay rent.

Its aim was to establish an Irish workers' republic. The party split in 1904 following months of internal political rows. History The party was small throughout its existence. According to the ISRP historian Lynch, the party never had more than 80 members. Upon its founding one journalist commented that the party had more syllables than members. The party emerged out of the Dublin Socialist Club when a motion was put forward at Pierce Ryan's pub on Thomas Street, Dublin to form a party. Connolly and six others were present at inaugural meeting.Irish socialist republicanism, 1909‚Äì36 by Adrian Grant page 19 Nevertheless, the ISRP is regarded by many Irish historians as a party of seminal importance in the early history of Irish socialism and republicanism. It is often described as the first socialist and republican party in Ireland, and the first organisation to espouse the ideology of socialist republicanism on the island. During its lifespan it only had one really active branch, the Dublin one. There were several attempts to create branches in Cork, Belfast, Limerick, Naas, and even in northern England but they never came to much.Radical Politics in Modern Ireland- A History of the Irish Socialist Republican Party 1896-1904 (Irish Academic Press), David Lynch, The party established links with feminist and revolutionary Maud Gonne who approved of the party. The party produced the first regular socialist paper in Ireland, the Workers' Republic, ran candidates in local elections, represented Ireland at the Second International, and agitated over issues such as the Boer War and the 1798 commemorations. Politically the ISRP was before its time, putting the call for an independent \\"Republic\\" at the centre of its propaganda before Sinn F√©in or others had done so. A public meeting held by the party is described in Irish socialist playwright Sean O'Casey's autobiography Drums under the Window. Connolly who was the full-time paid organiser for the party subsequently left Ireland for the United States in 1903 following internal conflict; in fact it seems to have been a combination of the petty infighting and his own poverty that caused Connolly to abandon Ireland (he returned in 1910). Connolly had clashed with the party's other leading light, E. W. Stewart, over trade union and electoral strategy. A small number of members around Stewart established an anti-Connolly micro organisation called the Irish Socialist Labour Party. In 1904, this merged with the remains of the ISRP to form the Socialist Party of Ireland.Peter Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, p.251 References Further reading * David Lynch, Radical Politics in Modern Ireland: A History of the Irish Socialist Republican Party (ISRP) 1896-1904, (Dublin: Irish Academic Press 2005) * Mike Milotte, Communism in Modern Ireland: The Pursuit of the Workers' Republic since 1916, (Dublin 1984) * Charles Townshend, Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion (London 2006) * Charles Townshend, The Republic: The Fight For Irish Independence (London 2013) * Dictionary of Irish Biography (Dublin 2007) External links *A 'Political Studies Review' article on the ISRP *The text of the 1896 political programme of the ISRP *Review of book about ISRP *Interview with Connolly scholars on the legacy of Connolly and the ISRP on the 90th anniversary of the 1916 Rising.

The insignia is similar in design to the Naval Aviator insignia, consisting of a pair of golden wings, a shield, and crossed anchors. The Naval Flight Officer insignia is identical for both branches and is awarded in a single degree. To qualify for the NFO insignia, a service member must have completed officer aviation training and be qualified as a systems operator on board a Naval aircraft. Such qualifications include weapons system operations, airborne tactical data system operations, electronic warfare, and airborne navigation. The insignia originated in the 1930s and evolved from the Naval Aviation Observer insignia. The main reason for creating the NFO insignia in 1965-1966 was to recognize the higher degree of training required for naval flight officers, compared to other airborne support personnel. In the modern space age, the insignia is also upgradeable to a variation of the Naval Aviator Astronaut insignia. Known as the Naval Flight Officer Astronaut insignia, the decoration is a standard NFO insignia upon which is centered a golden astronaut \\"shooting star\\" logo. The badge is issued for those Naval Flight Officers who have completed astronaut training at NASA and have subsequently participated in a space flight more than 50 miles above the Earth. Drawing of the Coast Guard Flight Officer insignia Previously, the United States Coast Guard equivalent of the Naval Flight Officer insignia was known as the Coast Guard Flight Officer Badge.

In most cases this is real estate, but it can also include factoring, non-conforming assets, or other sources of collateral. Commercial lending practices Commercial lenders include commercial banks, mutual companies, private lending institutions, hard money lenders and other financial groups. These lenders typically have widely varying standards on which they base their loan criteria and evaluate potential borrowers‚Äîbut are often focused exclusively on the private market and have more lenient financial qualifications than banks. Commercial lenders specialize in hard money and bridge loans, often those that close quickly, in as little as two weeks. The commercial loan industry is most often accessed through brokers, who provide an evaluation of a borrower and then recommend the loan to a number of different commercial lenders whom they feel will be most likely to fund the borrower's request. Going through a broker rather than directly through a lender may cause longer wait times for loan financing and more up- front fees. However, they can greatly facilitate the process and come up with innovative and unique ways to overcome obstacles that the borrower may not be able to access on their own. Costs of commercial lenders Commercial lenders weigh the type, quality, and equity of the hard collateral very heavily. They provide the borrower with the greatest flexibility but also the highest rates when compared with bank loans. Many commercial loans are bridge loans where a higher rate is a good trade off for the speed with which the loan is delivered and the flexibility of the finance terms behind it. Commercial lending industry Thanks to freedom from regulation, the commercial lending industry operates with particular speed and responsiveness, making it an attractive option for those seeking quick funding. However, this has also created a highly predatory lending environment where many companies refer loans to one another (brokering), increasing the price and loan points with each referral. There is also great concern about the practices of some lending companies in the industry who require upfront payments to investigate loans and refuse to lend on virtually all properties while keeping this fee. Borrowers are advised not to work with hard money lenders who require exorbitant upfront fees prior to funding in order to reduce this risk. =Commercial lenders and loan terms= In recent years there have been some significant advances. A good example is that credit unions are now allowed to engage in commercial lending with only minor restrictions. Most notable among those restrictions is that credit unions are prohibited in most cases from lending more than 80% of the value of real property. This is done to protect credit union members from excessive risk and is a common practice in the industry as a whole, although not enforced. On the other hand, credit unions are cooperatives and can therefore offer competitive advantages over other institutions in regards to rate and other terms. Most commercial lenders prefer to offer terms for shorter periods of time than residential lenders might at thirty or so years. Commercial lenders sometimes offer a five or ten- year loan with a payout based on longer, thereby leaving a balloon payment due at the loan expiration. That often requires the property owner to come up with the balloon payment himself, or to refinance or sell. Additionally a commercial lender might attempt to charge a \\"pre-payment penalty\\" in order to guarantee a certain return, in the event the loan is not kept for the full term. Frequently pre-payment penalties range between one and five years and are for an amount of interest or number of months such as frequently will be seen a \\"six month interest guarantee\\" etc. =Commercial bridge loan= Commercial bridge loans are sometimes referred to as short term financing, bridge financing or even hard money. Bridge loans are easy to qualify for as long as there is equity remaining in the property sufficient to cover the commercial lender's risk capital. Commercial bridge lenders will overlook property issues, incomplete permits, credit and other problems in exchange for a higher rate of return. However they will look to offset that risk by lending at a lower loan to value ratio usually of under 65% of the property's value.

Its subtropical climate made Gagra a popular health resort in Imperial Russian and Soviet times. It had a population of 26,636 in 1989, but this has fallen considerably due to the ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia and other demographic shifts during and after the War in Abkhazia (1992‚Äì93). Gagra is the centre of the district of the same name. It is located in the western part of Region of Abkhazia, and river Psou serves as a border with Krasnodar Krai of Russia.  Etymology  According to the Georgian scholars, Gagra is derived from Gakra meaning walnut in the Svan language.Topchishvili, Roland (2005), History of Georgian Mountain Regions: Svaneti and Its Inhabitants (Ethno-historical Studies) . National Parliamentary Library of Georgia According to the Soviet sports tourism master Bondaryev, the name of the city originates from the local Gagaa clan. According to Professor V. Kvarchija, Gagra (< *ga-k º…ô-ra) means ‚Äòthe holder of the coast‚Äô in Abkhaz (Gagra was mentioned as Kakara, Kakkari on old maps).–ö”ô–∞—Ä“∑–∏–∞ –í. –ï. –ê“ß—Å–Ω—ã –∞—Ç–æ–ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∏–∫–∞ ‚Äî –ê“ü”ô–∞. 2002. P. 92  History  The town was established as a Greek colony in the kingdom of Colchis, called Triglite (), inhabited by Greeks and Colchians. Colchis came under the control of the kingdom of Pontus in the 1st century BC before being absorbed by the Roman Empire, which renamed the town as Nitica. Its geographical position led the Romans to fortify the town, which was repeatedly attacked by Goths and other invaders. After the fall of Rome, its successor, the Byzantine Empire, took control of the town and whole Colchis. It became a major trading settlement in which Genoan and Venetian merchants were prominent, trading in the town's main exports - wood, honey, wax and slaves. The name \\"Gagra\\" appeared for the first time on a map in 1308, on a map of the caucasus made by the Italian Pietro Visconti, which is now in the Library of Saint Mark in Venice. = Gagra within the Russian Empire = Palace of the Prince of Oldenburg In the 16th century, Gagra and the rest of western Georgia was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The western merchants were expelled and the town entered a prolonged period of decline, with much of the local population fleeing into the mountains. By the 18th century the town had been reduced to little more than a village surrounded by forests and disease-ridden swamps. Its fortunes were restored in the 19th century when the Russian Empire expanded into the region, annexing the whole of Georgia. The swamps were drained and the town was rebuilt around a new military hospital. Its population, however, was still small; in 1866, a census recorded that 336 men and 280 women, mostly local families or army officers and their dependents, lived in Gagra. The town suffered badly in the Russo-Turkish War, 1877-1878, when Turkish troops invaded, destroyed the town and expelled the local population. Russia won the war, however, and rebuilt Gagra again. View of Gagra's wharf sometime between 1905 and 1915. In 1904 the town was discovered by Duke Alexander of Oldenburg, a member of the Russian royalty. He saw the potential of the region's sub-tropical climate and decided to build a high- class resort there. Having raised a large sum of money from the government, he built a palace there for himself and constructed a number of other buildings in an eclectic variety of architectural styles from around Europe. A park was laid out with tropical trees and even parrots and monkeys imported to give it an exotic feel. Despite the expensive work, the resort was not initially a success, although it did later attract a growing number of foreign tourists visiting on cruises of the Black Sea. As a result of the resort, the area was ceded from Abkhazia to Russia in 1904, however it was switched back in 1917. = Gagra under the Soviet Union = In the Russian Revolution of 1905, a local uprising produced a revolutionary government in the town, which founded a short-lived Republic of Gagra. This was soon defeated and the revolutionaries arrested en masse. The First World War a few years later was a disaster for Gagra, destroying the tourist trade on which it depended. The Russian Revolution shortly afterwards saw the Bolsheviks take over the town; despite a brief French attempt to repel them during the Russian Civil War, the town was firmly incorporated into the new Soviet Union within Georgian SSR. The Bolshevik leader, Vladimir Lenin, issued a decree in 1919 establishing a \\"worker's resort\\" in Gagra, nationalising the resort that had been built by Oldenburg. It became a popular holiday resort for Soviet citizens and during World War II gained a new role as a site for the rehabilitation of wounded soldiers. After the war, various state-run sanatoriums were built there. The resort grew and was developed intensively as part of the \\"Soviet Riviera\\". = Gagra in post-soviet Abkhazia = In the late 1980s, tensions grew between the Georgian and Abkhazian communities in the region. All-out war erupted between 1992-1993 which ended in a defeat of the Georgian government's forces. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Georgians were expelled from their homes in Abkhazia in an outbreak of mass ethnic cleansing in which thousands of Georgian civilians were massacred.Human Rights Watch Arms Project.

It began as a pioneering range of furniture in the United Kingdom produced by E Gomme Ltd of High Wycombe. The success of G Plan led to E Gomme becoming one of the UK's largest furniture manufacturers, with profits increasing sixfold between 1952 and 1958 when it was floated as an IPO. Since 2005, G Plan has been a subsidiary of Sofa Brands International. History The company was founded in High Wycombe in 1898 by Ebeneezer Gomme, at first making hand-made chairs, and building a factory at Leigh Street in 1909. By 1922 there were 300 employees, and a second factory was opened in 1927 at Spring Gardens, next to the railway line. From 1943, during World War II, furniture sales were controlled by rationing; the Board of Trade set up the Utility scheme which limited the types of furniture on sale and their cost, and a small number of simple designs were available in oak or mahogany. The ending of this scheme in December 1952, combined with the 1951 Festival of Britain, led to a pent-up demand for more modern furniture. alt= In 1953, Donald Gomme, the designer at E Gomme, decided to produce a range of modern furniture for the entire house which could be bought piece-by- piece according to budgets. Advertising was part of the plan from the beginning. The name was coined by Doris Gundry of the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, and the furniture was advertised in magazines and in cinemas direct to the public. Designs were available for several years so people could collect them slowly. All furniture was marked with a distinctive brand mark. alt= Another part of the direct marketing was the showrooms where the public could see the furniture. There were small centres in the country, and \\"The G Plan Gallery\\" in Vogue House, St George Street, Hanover Square in London. Donald Gomme left the company in 1958, perhaps the peak of the company's success. alt= In the early 1960s the government introduced restrictions on hire purchase (the most common method of purchasing furniture), and in response to competition from Danish furniture the company introduced a Danish Modern range (designed by Ib Kofod-Larsen), which made the rest of the range seem dated. Gomme lost their market-leading position, though they continued to be a major manufacturer making innovative designs with a very well known brand name. In 1987 the Gomme family ‚Äì major shareholders in the company ‚Äì decided to retire. They sold the business to the then directors, who, three years later, sold it to the Christie Tyler group of companies. In 1996 the Morris Furniture Group acquired the licence to make and market G Plan Cabinet furniture in Glasgow, operating separately to the upholstery business. G Plan Upholstery Ltd, now based at a modern factory and offices near Melksham, Wiltshire, continues to manufacture most of its sofa and armchair products in the UK.http://www.gplan.co.uk/  Acquisition by Sofa Brands  Following the 2005 collapse of Christie Tyler, G Plan was acquired by Sofa Brands International, a holding company, alongside the Parker Knoll and Duresta upholstery brands. G Plan Cabinets was sold by Morris to Sofa Brands in 2015, and cabinet manufacturing ceased. Sofa Brands was acquired in 2015 by its management team and Promethean Investments, a private equity firm. In the same year the company moved its registered office to G Plan's Melksham address. , G Plan was a wholly owned subsidiary of Sofa Brands International.

It is one of four private schools known collectively as the Loughborough Endowed Schools, along with Loughborough Grammar School for boys, Loughborough High School for girls and Our Lady's Convent School for girls and boys until Year 6 then only girls for secondary from Year 7. Fairfield is a strong academic school with the majority of pupils going on to attend secondary public schools or high performing independent schools. It serves primarily as the preparatory feeder school for Loughborough Grammar School for boys and Loughborough High School or Our Lady's Convent School for girls, however many also go on to attend the surrounding public schools including Ratcliffe College, Trent College, Oakham School, Repton School and Uppingham School. All four of the Loughborough Endowed Schools are autonomous, and yet they share the same vision and educational ethos, supported by a united board of governors. The catchment area for Fairfield is large due to the school's popularity with children travelling from Loughborough and the surrounding villages and from as far as Leicester, Nottingham, Rutland and Derby. The school's oldest building, Fairfield House was built in 1823 by a family of wealthy and influential hosiery manufacturers known as the White family who left in 1893. Later the building was bequeathed to the school and after initially being used as the site for the Loughborough Endowed School's girls junior department it became an integral part of the present Preparatory School.

He was the author of more than ninety books on a wide variety of subjects, including astronomy, clocks, engineering, mathematics, mechanics, optics and natural philosophy. In 1574 the Ottoman Sultan Murad III invited Taqƒ´ ad-Dƒ´n to build the Constantinople observatory. Using his exceptional knowledge in the mechanical arts, Taqƒ´ ad-Dƒ´n constructed instruments like huge armillary and mechanical clocks that he used in his observations of the Great Comet of 1577. He also used European celestial and terrestrial globes that were delivered to Istanbul in gift-exchange. The major work that resulted from his work in the observatory is titled \\"The tree of ultimate knowledge [in the end of time or the world] in the Kingdom of the Revolving Spheres: The astronomical tables of the King of Kings [MurƒÅd III]\\" (Sidrat al-muntah al-afkar fi malk≈´t al-falak al-dawƒÅr‚Äì al-zij al-ShƒÅhinshƒÅhi). The work was prepared according to the results of the observations carried out in Egypt and Istanbul in order to correct and complete Ulugh Beg's Zij as-Sultani. The first 40 pages of the work deal with calculations, followed by discussions of astronomical clocks, heavenly circles, and information about three eclipses which he observed at Cairo and Istanbul. For corroborating data of other observations of eclipses in other locales like Daud ar-Riyyadi (David the Mathematician), David Ben- Shushan of Salonika. As a polymath, Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n wrote numerous books on astronomy, mathematics, mechanics, and theology. His method of finding coordinates of stars were reportedly so precise that he got better measurements than his contemporaries, Tycho Brahe and Nicolas Copernicus. Brahe is also thought to have been aware of al-Dƒ´n's work.√Ågoston, G√°bor; Masters, Bruce Alan. Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire Infobase Publishing, 2009. p. 552 Taqƒ´ Ad-Dƒ´n also described a steam turbine with the practical application of rotating a spit in 1551. He worked on and created astronomical clocks for his observatory. Taqƒ´ Ad-Dƒ´n also wrote a book on optics, in which he determined the light emitted from objects, proved the Law of Reflection observationally, and worked on refraction. Biography Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n was born in Damascus in 1526 according to most sources, although he himself says he was born and raised in the Beqaa Valley, in today's Lebanon. His ethnicity has been described as Ottoman Arab,\\"Two such cases are Piri Reis (d.1554), an Ottoman Turk from Gallipoli, and Taqi al-Din (d.1585), an Ottoman Arab from Damascus.

The Encyclopaedia of Islam makes no mention of his ethnicity, simply calling him, \\"..the most important astronomer of Ottoman Turkey\\".Taki al-Din, D.A. King, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. X, ed. PJ. Bearman, TH. Bianquis, C. E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W. P. Heinrichs, (Brill, 2000), 132. Taqi ad-Din's education started in theology and as he went on he would gain an interest in the rational sciences. Following his interest, he would begin to study the rational sciences in Damascus and Cairo. During that time he studied alongside his father Ma øruf Efendi. Al-Dƒ´n went on to teach at various madaris and served as a qadi, or judge, in Palestine, Damascus, and Cairo. He stayed in Egypt and Damascus for some time and while he was there he created work in astronomy and mathematics. His work in these categories would eventually become important. He became a chief astronomer to the Sultan in 1571 a year after he came to Istanbul, replacing Mustafa ibn Ali al-Muwaqqit. Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n maintained a strong bond with the people from the Ulama and statesmen. He would pass on information to Sultan Murad III who had an interest in astronomy but also in astrology. The information stated that Ulugh Beg Zij had particular observational errors. Al-Dƒ´n made a suggestions that those errors could be fixed if there were new observations made. He also suggested that an observatory should be created in Istanbul to make that situation easier. Murad III would become a patron of the first observatory in Istanbul. He preferred that construction for the new observatory begin immediately. Since Murad III was the patron he would assist with finances for the project. Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n continued his studies at the Galata Tower while this was going on. His studies would continue until 1577 at the nearly complete observatory, which was called Dar al-Rasad al-Jadid. This new observatory contained a library that held books which covered astronomy and mathematics. The observatory, built in the higher part of Tophane in Istanbul, was made of two separate buildings. One building was big and the other one was small. Al- Dƒ´n possessed some of the instruments used in the old Islamic observatories. He had those instruments reproduced and also created new instruments which would be used for observational purposes. The staff at the new observatory consisted of sixteen people. Eight of them were observers or rasids, four of them were clerks, and the last four were assistants. Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n approached his observations in a creative way and created new answers to astronomical problems due to the new strategies he created along with the new equipment he created as well. He would go on to create trigonometric tables based on decimal fractions. These tables placed the ecliptic at 23¬∞ 28' 40\\". The current value was 23¬∞ 27' showing that al-Dƒ´n's instruments and methods were more precise. Al-Dƒ´n used a new method to calculate solar parameters and to determine the magnitude of the annual movement of the sun's apogee as 63 seconds. The known value today is 61 seconds. Copernicus came up with 24 seconds and Tycho Brahe had 45 seconds but al-Dƒ´n was more accurate than both. The main purpose behind the observatory was to cater to the needs of the astronomers and provide a library and workshop so they could design and produce instruments. This observatory would become one of the largest ones in the Islamic world. It was complete in 1579. It would go on to run until January 22, 1580 which is when it was destroyed. Some say religious arguments was the reason why it was destroyed, but it really came down to political problems. A report by the grand vizier Sinan Pasha to Sultan Murad III goes into how the Sultan and the vizier attempted to keep Taqƒ´ Ad-Dƒ´n away from the ulama because it seemed like they wanted to take him to trial for heresy. The vizier informs the sultan that Taqƒ´ Ad-Dƒ´n wanted to go to Syria regardless of the sultan's orders. The vizier also warned the sultan that if Taqƒ´ Ad-Dƒ´n went there, there is a possibility that he would be noticed by the ulama who would take him to trial. Despite Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n's originality, his influence seemed to be limited. There are only a small number of surviving copies of his works so they were not able to reach a wide variety of people. His commentaries that are known are very few. However, one of his works and a piece of a library that he owned reached western Europe pretty quickly. This was due to the manuscript collecting efforts of Jacob Golius, a Dutch professor of Arabic and mathematics at Leiden University. Golius traveled to Istanbul in the early seventeenth century. In 1629 he wrote a letter to Constantin Huygens that talks about seeing Taqƒ´ Ad-Dƒ´n's work on optics in Istanbul. He argued that he was not able to get ahold of it from his friends even after all his efforts. He must have succeeded in acquiring it later since Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n's work on optics would eventually make it to the Bodleian Library as Marsh 119. It was originally in the Golius collection so it is clear that Golius eventually succeeded at acquiring it. According to Salomon Schweigger, the chaplain of Habsburg ambassador Johann Joachim von Sinzendorf, Taqi al-Din was a charlatan who deceived Sultan Murad III and had him spent enormous resources.Salomon Schweigger, Ein newe Reyssbeschreibung auss Teutschland nach Constantinopel und Jerusalem (Graz, 1964), 90‚Äì1. The Constantinople Observatory Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n was both the founder and director of the Constantinople Observatory, which is also known as the Istanbul Observatory. This observatory is frequently said to be one of Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n's most important contributions to sixteenth-century Islamic and Ottoman astronomy. In fact, it is known as one of the largest observatories in Islamic history. It is often compared to Tycho Brahe's Uraniborg Observatory, which was said to have been the home to the best instruments of its time in Europe. As a matter of fact, Brahe and Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n have frequently been compared for their work in sixteenth-century astronomy. The founding of the Constantinople Observatory began when Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n returned to Istanbul in 1570, after spending 20 years in Egypt developing his astronomy and mathematical knowledge. Shortly after his return, Sultan Selƒ´m II appointed Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n as the head astronomer (M√ºneccimbast), following the death of the previous head astronomer Mu·π£·π≠afƒÅ ibn “ÅAlƒ´ al-Muwaqqit in 1571. During the early years of his position as head astronomer, Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n worked in both the Galata Tower and a building overlooking Tophane. While working in these buildings, he began to gain the support and trust of many important Turkish officials. These newfound relationships lead to an imperial edict in 1569 from Sultan Murad III, which called for the construction of the Constantinople Observatory. This observatory became home to many important books and instruments, as well as many renowned scholars of the time. While there is not much known of the architectural characteristics of the building, there are many depictions of the scholars and astronomical instruments present in the observatory. However, due to political conflict, this observatory was short lived. It was closed 1579 and, was demolished entirely by the state on 22 January 1580, only 11 short years after the imperial edict for its construction. = Politics = The rise and fall of Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n and his observatory depended on political issues that surrounded him. Due to his father's occupation as a professor at the Damascene College of law Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n spent much of his life in Syria and Egypt. During his trips to Istanbul he was able to make connections with many scholar-jurists. He was also able to use the private library of the Grand Vizier of the time, Semiz Ali Pasha. He then began working under Sultan Murad III's new Grand Vizier's, private mentor Sa'deddin. Continuing his research on observations of the heavens while in Egypt Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n used the Galata tower and Sa'deddin's private residence. Although Murad III was the one who commanded an observatory to be built it was actually Sa'deddin who brought the idea to him knowing about his interest in science.Tezcan, Baki. \\"Some Thoughts on the Politics of Early Modern Ottoman Science.\\" Osmanlƒ± Ara≈ütƒ±rmalarƒ± 36, no. 36 (2010). The Sultan ultimately would provide Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n with everything he needed from financial assistance for the physical buildings, to intellectual assistance making sure he had easy access to many types of books he would need. When the Sultan decided to create the observatory he saw it as a way to show off the power his monarchy had besides just financially backing it. Murad III showed his power by bringing Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n and some of the most accomplished men in the field of astronomy together to work towards one goal and not only have them work well together but also make progress in the field. Murad III made sure that there was proof of his accomplishments by having his court historiographer Seyyid Lokman keep very detailed records of the work going on at the observatory. Seyyid Lokman wrote that his sultan's monarchy was much more powerful than others in Iraq, Persia, and Anatolia. He also claimed that Murad III was above other monarchs because the results of the observatory were new to the world and replaced many others. = Instruments Used at the Observatory = Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n used a variety of instruments to aid in his work at the observatory. Some were instruments that were already in use from European Astronomers while others he invented himself. While working in this observatory, Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n not only operated many previously created instruments and techniques, but he also developed numerous new ones. Of these novel inventions, the automatic-mechanical clock is regarded as one of the most important developed in the Constantinople Observatory. *Each of these instruments were first described by Ptolemy. **An Armillary Sphere- A model of celestial bodies with rings that represent longitude and latitude. **A Paralactic Ruler- also known as a Triquetrum was used to calculate the altitudes of celestial bodies. **An Astrolabe- Measures the inclined position of celestial bodies. *These instruments were created by Muslim astronomers. **A Mural quadrant, a type of mural Instrument for measuring angles from 0 to 90 degrees. **An Azimuthally Quadrant *Each of the instruments were created by Taqi al-Din to use for his own work. * A Parallel ruler * A Ruler Quadrant or Wooden Quadrant an instrument with two holes for the measurement of apparent diameters and eclipses. * A mechanical clock with a train of cogwheels which helped measure the true ascension of the stars. * Mu≈üabbaha bi'l-menatƒ±k, an instrument with chords to determine the equinoxes, invented to replace the equinoctial armillary. *A Sunaydi Ruler which was apparently a special type of instrument of an auxiliary nature, the function of which was explained by Alaeddin el-Mansur Contributions = Clock Mechanics =  Rise of Clock use in the Ottoman Empire  Before the sixteenth century European mechanical clocks were not in high demand. This lack of demand was brought on by the extremely high prices and the lack of preciseness needed by the population who had to calculate when they would have to have the prayer. The use of hourglasses, water clocks, and sundials was more than enough to meet their needs. It was not until around 1547 that the Ottomans started creating a high demand for them. Initially, it was started by the gifts brought by the Austrians but this would end up starting a market for the clocks. European clockmakers began to create clocks designed to the tastes and needs of the Ottoman people. They did this by showing both the phases of the moon and by utilizing Ottoman numbers.  Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n's Work  During this high demand for mechanical clocks, Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n was asked by the Grand Vizier to create a clock that would show exactly when the call to prayer was. This would lead him to write his first book on the construction of mechanical clocks called, \\"al-Kawakib al-Durriya fi Bengamat al-Dawriyya\\" in 1563 A.D. which he used throughout his research at the short-lived observatory.Stolz, Daniel A. \\"POSITIONING THE WATCH HAND: 'ULAMA' AND THE PRACTICE OF MECHANICAL TIMEKEEPING IN CAIRO, 1737‚Äì1874.\\" 47, no. 3 (2015): 489-510. He believed that it would be advantageous to bring a \\"true hermetic and distilled perception of the motion of the heavenly bodies.\\" In order to get a better understanding of how clocks ran Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n took the time to gain knowledge from many European clock makers as well as going into the treasury of Semiz Ali Pasha and learning anything he could from the many clocks he owned.  Types of clocks Examined  Of the clocks in the Grand Vizier's treasury Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n examined three different types. Those three were weight driven, spring driven, and clocks with lever escapement. In his writing, he spoke of these three types of watches but he also made comments on pocket watches and astronomical ones. As Chief Astronomer Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n created a mechanical astronomical clock. This clock was made in order for him to be able to take more precise measurements from his observations done at the Constantinople observatory. As stated above the creation of this clock was thought to be one of the most important astronomical discoveries of the sixteenth century. According to his writing in his booIn the nabk tree of the extremity of thoughts Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n constructed a mechanical clock with three dials which show the hours, minutes, and seconds, with each minute consisting of five seconds. After this clock it is not known whether Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n's work in mechanical clocks was ever continued since much of the clock making after that time in the Ottoman Empire was taken over by Europeans. = Steam = In 1551 Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n described a self-rotating spit that is important in the history of the steam turbine. In Al-Turuq al-samiyya fi al-alat al-ruhaniyya (The Sublime Methods of Spiritual Machines) al-Dƒ´n describes this machine as well as some practical applications for it. The spit is rotated by directing steam into the vanes which then turns the wheel at the end of the axel. Al-Dƒ´n also described four water-raising machines. The first two are animal driven water pumps. The third and fourth are both driven by a paddle wheel. The third is a slot-rod pump while the fourth is a six-cylinder pump. The vertical pistons of the final machine are operated by cams and trip-hammers, run by the paddle wheel. The descriptions of these machines predates many of the more modern engines. The screw pump, for example, that al-Dƒ´n describes predates Agricola, whose description of the rag and chain pump was published in 1556. The two pump engine, which was first described by al-Jazarƒ´, was also the basis of the steam engine.  Important Works  = Astronomy = *Sidrat muntahƒÅ al-afkƒÅr fƒ´ malak≈´t al-falak al-dawwƒÅr (al-Zƒ´j al-ShƒÅhinshƒÅhƒ´): this is said to be one of Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n's most important works in astronomy. He completed this book on the basis of his observations in both Egypt and Istanbul. The purpose of this work was to improve, correct, and ultimately complete Zƒ´j-i Ulugh Beg, which was a project devised in Samarkand and furthered in the Constantinople Observatory. The first 40 pages of his writing focus on trigonometric calculations, with emphasis on trigonometric functions such sine, cosine, tangent, and cotangent. *Jarƒ´dat al-durar wa kharƒ´dat al-fikar is a zƒ´j that is said to be Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n's second most important work in astronomy. This zƒ´j contains the first recorded use of decimal fractions and trigonometric functions in astronomical tables. He also gives the parts of degree of curves and angles in decimal fractions with precise calculations. *Dust≈´r al-tarjƒ´·∏• li-qawƒÅ “Å id al-tas·π≠ƒ´·∏• is another important work by Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n, which focuses on the projection of a sphere into a plane, among other geometric topics. *Taqƒ´ al-Din is also accredited as the author of Ray·∏•ƒÅnat al-r≈´·∏• fƒ´ rasm al-sƒÅ “Å ƒÅt “Å alƒÅ mustawƒ´ al-su·π≠≈´·∏•, which discusses sundials and their characteristics drawn on a marble surface. = Clocks and Mechanics = *al-KawƒÅkib al-durriyya fƒ´ wa·∏ç “Å _al_ -bankƒÅmƒÅt al- _dawriyya_ was written by Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n in 1559 and addressed mechanical-automatic clocks. This work is considered the first written work on mechanical-automatic clocks in the Islamic and Ottoman world. In this book, he accredits Alƒ´ Pasha as a contributor for allowing him to use and study his private library and collection of European mechanical clocks. * al-·π¨uruq al-saniyya fƒ´ al-ƒÅlƒÅt al-r≈´·∏•ƒÅniyya is a second book on mechanics by Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n that emphasizes the geometrical-mechanical structure of clocks, which was a topic previously observed and studied by Ban≈´ M≈´sƒÅ and Ismail al-Jazari (Ab≈´ al-“ÅIzz al-Jazarƒ´). = Physics and Optics = *Nawr ·∏•adƒ´qat al-ab·π£ar wa-n≈´r ·∏•aqƒ´qat al-An·∫ìar was a work of Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n that discussed physics and optics. This book discussed the structure of light, the relationship between light and color, as well as diffusion and global refraction.

Fosdick became a central figure in the Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist controversy within American Protestantism in the 1920s and 1930s and was one of the most prominent liberal ministers of the early 20th century. Although a Baptist, he was called to serve as pastor, in New York City, at First Presbyterian Church in Manhattan's West Village, and then at the historic, inter-denominational Riverside Church in Morningside Heights, Manhattan. Career Born in Buffalo, New York, Fosdick graduated from Colgate University in 1900 and from Union Theological Seminary in 1904. While attending Colgate University he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity. He was ordained a Baptist minister in 1903 at Madison Avenue Baptist Church at 31st Street, Manhattan. He was called as minister to First Baptist Church, Montclair, New Jersey, in 1904, serving until 1915. He supported US participation in the First World War (later describing himself as a \\"gullible fool\\" in doing soArmistice Sermon, The Unknown Soldier, Riverside Church, November 12, 1933), and in 1917 volunteered as an Army chaplain, serving in France. In 1918 he was called to First Presbyterian Church, and on May 21, 1922, he delivered his famous sermon Shall the Fundamentalists Win?,. in which he defended the modernist position. In that sermon he presented the Bible as a record of the unfolding of God's will, not as the literal \\"Word of God\\". He saw the history of Christianity as one of development, progress, and gradual change. Fundamentalists regarded this as rank apostasy, and the battle-lines were drawn. Fosdick's sermon prompted a response from the Rev. Clarence Edward Macartney of Arch Street Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia on July 13, 1922 with a sermon entitled \\"Shall Unbelief Win?\\". Like Fosdick's sermon, Macartney's sermon was published and sent to church leaders across America. \\"There are not a few,\\" said Macartney, \\"who do not think of themselves as either 'Fundamentalists' or 'Modernists', but as Christians, striving amid the dust and the confused clamor of this life to hold the Christian faith and follow the Lord Jesus Christ, who will read this sermon with sorrow and pain.\\" The national convention of the General Assembly of the old Presbyterian Church in the USA in 1923 charged his local presbytery in New York to conduct an investigation into Fosdick's views. A commission began an investigation, as required. His defense was conducted by a lay elder, John Foster Dulles (1888‚Äì1959, future Secretary of State under President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1950s), whose father was a well-known liberal Presbyterian seminary professor. Fosdick escaped probable censure at a formal trial by the 1924 General Assembly by resigning from the First Presbyterian Church (historic \\"Old First\\") pulpit in 1924. He was immediately called as pastor of a new type of Baptist church ministry at Park Avenue Baptist Church, whose most famous member was the industrialist, financier and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr.. Rockefeller then funded the famed ecumenical Riverside Church (later a member of the American Baptist Churches and United Church of Christ denominations) in Manhattan's northwestern Morningside Heights area overlooking the Hudson River and nearby Columbia University, where Fosdick became pastor as soon as the doors opened in October 1930. thumb This prompted a Time magazine cover story on October 6, 1930 (pictured), in which Time said that Fosdick: Fosdick outspokenly opposed racism and injustice. Ruby Bates credited him with persuading her to testify for the defense in the 1933 retrial of the infamous and racially charged legal case of the Scottsboro Boys, which tried nine black youths before all-white juries for allegedly raping white women (Bates and her companion Victoria Price) in Alabama. Sermons and publications Fosdick's sermons won him wide recognition. His 1933 anti-war sermon, \\"The Unknown Soldier\\", inspired the British priest Dick Sheppard to write a letter that ultimately led to the founding of the Peace Pledge Union. His Riverside Sermons was printed in 1958, and he published numerous other books. His radio addresses were nationally broadcast; he also wrote the hymn \\"God of Grace and God of Glory\\". Fosdick's book A Guide to Understanding the Bible traces the beliefs of the people who wrote the Bible, from the ancient beliefs of the Hebrews (which he regarded as practically pagan) to the faith and hopes of the New Testament writers. Fosdick was an advocate of theistic evolution. He defended the teaching of evolution in schools and rejected creationism. He was involved in a dispute with the creationist William Jennings Bryan.Holland, DeWitte Talmadge. (1973). America in Controversy: History of American Public Address. W. C. Brown Co.

AA members continue to point to this review as significant in the development of the AA movement. Fosdick was an active member of the American Friends of the Middle East, a founder of the Committee for Justice and Peace in the Holy Land, and an active \\"anti-Zionist\\". . He was a major influence on Martin Luther King Jr, who said that Fosdick was \\"the greatest preacher of this century.\\" (https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/fosdick-harry-emerson) King drew on Fosdick's writings and sermons for some of his own sermons.

For many years it served as a goodnight or farewell waltz at the annual Ashokan Fiddle & Dance Camps run by Ungar and his wife Molly Mason, who gave the tune its name, at the Ashokan Field Campus of SUNY New Paltz (now the Ashokan Center) in Upstate New York. The tune was used as the title theme of the 1990 PBS television miniseries The Civil War. Despite its late date of composition, it was included in the 1991 compilation album Songs of the Civil War. The composition though written in 1982, has many similarities to the song \\"Massa's In The Cold Cold Ground\\", written in 1852 by Stephen C. Foster. It is unknown if this is the reason why it was included in Ken Burn's Civil war. The song itself was written 9 years before the beginning of the U.S. Civil War and seems to presage it. Background The piece is a waltz in D major, composed in the style of a Scottish lament (e.g., Niel Gow's \\"Lament for His Second Wife\\"). Jay Ungar describes the song as coming out of \\"a sense of loss and longing\\" after the annual Ashokan Music & Dance Camps ended. The most famous arrangement of the piece begins with a solo violin, later accompanied by guitar and upright bass. Another arrangement, featuring Ungar, Mason, and their family band, is performed with two violins, an acoustic guitar, and a banjo, with the piece beginning with a solo violin. Before its use as the television series theme, \\"Ashokan Farewell\\" was recorded on Waltz of the Wind, the second album by the band Fiddle Fever. The musicians included Ungar and Mason. Ashokan was the name of a former village in the Catskill region that is now mostly covered by the Ashokan Reservoir. Use in The Civil War documentary series In 1984, filmmaker Ken Burns heard \\"Ashokan Farewell\\" and was moved by it. He used it in two of his documentary films: Huey Long (1985), and The Civil War (1990), which features the original recording by Fiddle Fever in the beginning of the film. The Civil War drew the greatest attention to the piece. It is played 25 times throughout the eleven-hour series, including during the emotional reading of Sullivan Ballou's letter to his wife in the first episode. The song underlies nearly an hour of film. Viewers of The Civil War frequently believe the melody is a traditional tune from the Civil War era; in fact, it is the only modern composition on the film's soundtrack, as all other music is authentic 19th-century music. In the wake of the success of the series and its soundtrack album, the track was released as a single by Elektra Nonesuch, backed with the \\"Sullivan Ballou Letter\\" recording featuring narrator David McCullough and actor Paul Roebling reading the part of Ballou. It subsequently received airtime on some country music- formatted radio stations, which was timely as the United States entered Operation Desert Storm. Elektra Nonesuch director of media relations Carol Yaple told Billboard magazine, \\"I think ['Ashokan Farewell'] was the theme that people could sort of attach the series identity to. However... [the series' music] is really all of the period. There's nothing sexy or contemporary about it, really, except that it was attached to that series and is good music, certainly.\\"DiMartino, Dave. \\"Instrumental Soundtracks Chime In\\". Billboard magazine, 16 February 1991, p. 10. The song was later used in the Louie episode \\"The Road: Part II\\", where Louie dresses up in a Civil War uniform for an old-time photograph. Most recently, the song is used in the premiere of the television series Yellowstone.

Tin soldiers are miniature figures of toy soldiers that are very popular in the world of collecting. They can be bought finished or in a raw state to be hand-painted. They are generally made of pewter, tin, lead, other metals or plastic. Often very elaborate scale models of battle scenes, known as dioramas, are created for their display. Tin soldiers were originally almost two-dimensional figures, often called \\"little Eilerts\\" or \\"flats\\". They were the first toy soldiers to be mass-produced. Though largely superseded in popularity from the late 19th century by fully rounded three-dimensional lead figures, these flat tin soldiers continue to be produced. History The first mass-produced tin soldiers were made in Germany as a tribute to Frederick the Great during the 18th century. Johann Gottfried Hilpert (1748‚Äì1832) and his brother Johann Georg Hilpert (1733‚Äì1811) established an early assembly-line in 1775 for soldiers and other figures; female painters applied a single color on each figurine as it was passed around the workshop. Hilpert, living in Nuremberg was probably the first to create them as a mass-produced toy. The world's largest Tin Soldier is located in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada. Casting \\"Real\\" tin soldiers, i.e., ones cast from an alloy of tin and lead, can also be home-made. Moulds are available for sale in some hobby shops. Earlier, the moulds were made of metal; currently, they are often made of hard rubber which can stand the temperature of the molten metal, around 250 ¬∞C. Literature Illustration by Vilhelm Pedersen for The Steadfast Tin Soldier (Den Standhaftige Tinsoldat). The best-known tin soldier in literature is the unnamed title character in Hans Christian Andersen's 1838 fairy tale The Steadfast Tin Soldier. It concerns a tin soldier who had only one leg because \\"he had been left to the last, and then there was not enough of the melted tin to finish him.\\" He falls in love with a dancer made of paper and after much adventuring, including being swallowed by a fish, the two are consumed together by fire, leaving nothing but tin melted \\"in the shape of a little tin heart.\\" Tin soldiers also play a role in \\"Knight's Castle\\" by Edward Eager.

Design and description The Avenger-class escort carriers were converted type C3 American merchant ships. Their design was based on the United States Navys (AVG1). To differentiate between the two classes, the Royal Navy ships were prefixed with a 'B' (BAVG). HMS Dasher (BAVG4) was built by the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. Originally named Rio de Janeiro, she was laid down on 11 March 1940, launched on 12 April 1941 and delivered on 22 November 1941.Cocker (2008), p.78. She was converted to an escort aircraft carrier in the Tietjen & Long shipyards New Jersey and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 2 July 1942.Poolman (1972), p.38. Dasher had a complement of 555 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. Propulsion was provided by four diesel engines connected to one shaft giving , which could propel the ship at .Cocker (2008), p.79. Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge‚Äìflight control on the starboard side and above the long wooden flight deck, one aircraft lift by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by half hangar below the flight deck.Poolman (1972), p.29. Armament comprised three single mounted 4 inch dual-purpose guns, two forward and one aft, and fifteen 20 mm cannon on single or twin mounts. She had the capacity for 15 aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighters and Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers. Service history Dasher started out as the merchantman Rio de Janeiro built by Sun Shipbuilding (Maritime Commission contract (Hull Sun-62)). She was converted at Tietjen & Lang, transferred to the Royal Navy and finally commissioned into RN service as HMS Dasher (D37) on 2 July 1942. She participated in Operation Torch, with her sister ship , carrying Sea Hurricanes of 804 Naval Air Squadron. After aircraft ferry duties in the Mediterranean, Dasher sailed to the Clyde in March 1943 and, having had her flight-deck lengthened by , she embarked Fairey Swordfish aircraft. She escorted one convoy successfully, but shortly after leaving with the second, Dasher suffered engine trouble and turned back. Shortly after getting to the Firth of Clyde on 27 March 1943, she suffered a major internal explosion and sank. =Loss= The memorial at Ardrossan seafront. Various possible causes have been suggested, including one of her aircraft crashing onto the flight deck and igniting petrol fumes from leaking tanks. Much of what happened remains unknown. Her death toll, 379 out of 528 crewmen, despite rapid response and assistance from ships and rescue craft from Brodick and Lamlash on the Isle of Arran and from Ardrossan and Greenock on the Scottish mainland, was amongst the highest in British home waters. Many escaped from the ship but died of hypothermia or burns suffered when escaped fuel ignited on the water. Most of the dead were buried at Ardrossan or Greenock. The US blamed the disaster on poor RN petrol handling procedures, and the British on bad design of the stowage and handling. There were merits in both arguments, but thereafter the stowage on her British operated sister ships was reduced from down to , and the USN reduced theirs also but not as drastically.Brown, DK Nelson to Vanguard 2000 Chatham Publishing, p64-65 The government of the time, eager to avoid damage to morale and anxious to avoid any suggestion of faulty US construction, tried to cover up the sinking. The local media were ordered to make no reference to the tragedy, and the authorities ordered the dead to be buried in a mass unmarked grave. Furious relatives protested and some of the dead were returned to their loved ones for burial. The survivors were ordered not to talk about what happened. This policy subsequently attracted much criticism, and now memorials to those lost exist at both Ardrossan and Brodick. The wreck site lies approximately halfway on the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry route between Ardrossan and Brodick and is a controlled site under the Protection of Military Remains Act. Teak boards from the flightdeck of Dasher washed up on the beach at Ardrossan in 1999.HMS Dasher website They were riddled with tubes made by burrowing teredo worms. A section of this wood featured in the \\"Flotsam and Jetsam\\" exhibition in the Millennium Dome and another piece is held by the North Ayrshire Heritage Centre in Saltcoats. There has been speculation that one corpse from the sinking was used during the British deception Operation Mincemeat (\\"The Man Who Never Was\\"). The case is argued by authors John and Noreen Steele in their book The Secrets of HMS \\"Dasher\\". An archaeological dig was undertaken in October 2012 to ascertain whether there was a mass grave within Ardrossan Cemetery containing bodies from Dasher. This dig showed there was no disturbance to the ground in the area searched.

However, it only existed for a few years and was destroyed in 1580. History In 1574, Murad III became the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. The empire's chief astronomer, Taqi ad-Din, petitioned the Sultan to finance the building of a great observatory to rival Ulugh Beg's Samarkand observatory. The Sultan approved, and construction was completed in 1577,John Morris Roberts, The History of the World, pp. 264-74, Oxford University Press, at nearly the same time as Tycho Brahe's observatory at Uraniborg. This observatory consisted of two large structures perched on a hill overlooking the European section of Constantinople and offering a wide view of the night sky. Much like a modern institution, the main building was reserved for the library and the living quarters of the staff, while the smaller building housed a collection of instruments built by Taqi ad-Din. These included a giant armillary sphere and an accurate mechanical astronomical clock for measuring the position and speed of the planets. With these instruments, Taqi ad-Din had hoped to update the old astronomical tables describing the motion of the planets, sun, and moon. The observatory did not survive to advance the development of astronomy in the Muslim world. Within months of the observatory's completion, a comet with an enormous tail appeared in the sky and Sultan Murad III demanded a prognostication about it from his astronomer. \\"Working day and night without food and rest\\" Taqi ad-Din studied the comet and came up with the prediction that it was \\"an indication of well-being and splendor,\\" and would mean a \\"conquest of Persia\\". Unfortunately, instead of well-being a devastating plague followed in some parts of the empire, and several important persons died.Arabs and Astronomy, written by Paul Lunde and Zayn Bilkadi Saudi Aramco World, January February 1986 Astronomy was a respected and approved science among the Islamic clergy of the Ottoman Empire, yet the same could not be said with regard to astrology, a field which is considered to be divination and thus against sharia. In order to prevent its further use for astrological purposes, they successfully sought the observatory's destruction. This happened just as the king of Denmark built an observatory for Tycho Brahe that would pave the way for Kepler's elucidation of the orbits of planets. Instruments sextant similar to what Tycho Brahe later used as shown in the picture. Taqi ad-Din wrote an important treatise on astronomical instruments entitled the Observational Instruments of the Emperor's Catalogue, which describes the astronomical instruments used in the Constantinople observatory of Taqi ad-Din. These included ancient instruments such as the armillary sphere, paralactic ruler and astrolabe; medieval Muslim instruments such as the universal astrolabe, azimuthal and mural quadrants, and sextants; and several instruments he invented himself, including the mushabbaha bi'l manattiq, a framed sextant with cords for the determination of the equinoxes similar to what Tycho Brahe later used, and a wooden quadrant for measuring azimuths and elevations. His most important astronomical instrument, however, is the \\"observational clock\\", which in his In the Nabk Tree of the Extremity of Thoughts, he describes as \\"a mechanical clock with three dials which show the hours, the minutes, and the seconds. We divided each minute into five seconds.\\" This was used for measuring the right ascension of the stars. This is considered one of the most important innovations in 16th century practical astronomy, as at the start of the century clocks were not accurate enough to be used for astronomical purposes.Sevim Tekeli, \\"Taqi al-Din\\", in Helaine Selin (2008), Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures, Springer, (print), (online.) A \\"remarkably modern-looking\\" terrestrial globe of the Earth, one of the earliest of its kind, was constructed by Taqi ad-Din at the Constantinople observatory of Taqi ad-Din. Observations Taqi ad-Din made use of his new \\"observational clock\\" to produce a zij (named Culmination of Thoughts in the Kingdom of Rotating Spheres) more accurate than his predecessors, Tycho Brahe and Nicolaus Copernicus. Taqi ad-Din was also the first astronomer to employ a decimal point notation in his observations rather than the sexagesimal fractions used by his contemporaries and predecessors. He also made use of Al-Biruni's method of \\"three points observation\\". In The Culmination of Thoughts in the Kingdom of Rotating Spheres, Taqi ad-Din described the three points as \\"two of them being in opposition in the ecliptic and the third in any desired place on the ecliptic. He used this method to calculate the eccentricity of the Sun's orbit and the annual motion of the apogee, and so did Tycho Brahe and Copernicus shortly afterwards, though Taqi ad-Din's values were more accurate, due to his observational clock and other more accurate instruments.

She was laid down as a merchant ship at the Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock Company yard at Chester, Pennsylvania. Laid down on 28 December 1939, she was converted to an escort carrier and commissioned in the Royal Navy on 6 May 1942. She was returned to the United States in 1945 and subsequently lent to France. Design and description Biter was an . These carriers were converted American type C3 merchant ships. Their design was based on the U.S. Navy‚Ä≤s (AVG); to differentiate between the two classes, the Royal Navy added the prefix \\"B\\" (BAVG). HMS Biter (BAVG3) was built by the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, originally named the Rio-Parana; she was laid down on 28 December 1939, launched on 18 December 1940 and delivered on 4 September 1941.Cocker (2008), p.78. She was converted to an escort carrier in the Atlantic Basin Iron Works at Brooklyn New York and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 6 May 1942, under the command of Captain Conolly Abel Smith.Poolman (1972), p.51. Biter had a complement of 555 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a height of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. Propulsion was provided by four diesel engines connected to one shaft giving , which could propel the ship at .Cocker (2008), p.79. Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge‚Äìflight control on the starboard side and above the long wooden flight deck, one aircraft lift, one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the half hangar below the flight deck.Poolman (1972), p.29. Armament comprised three single mounted dual purpose guns and fifteen 20 mm cannons on single or twin mounts. She had the capacity for fifteen aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighters and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger torpedo bombers (also used for anti-submarine patrols). Service history After commissioning, Biter was being readied to leave New York when a fire broke out on 8 May 1942, in the catapult house which destroyed one of the catapult motors. Eventually believed ready for sea, she left the dock on 15 May but had to return to rectify an engine problem. Ready again for sea, she left on gunnery trials on 30 May and landed her first aircraft‚Äîa Fairey Swordfish‚Äîon 2 June. After completing flying trials, she left for Nova Scotia on 12 June, with one of her Swordfish flying anti-submarine patrols en route. Leaving Nova Scotia for Britain on 14 June, she again suffered from engine problems which cast her adrift for three hours while they were repaired. She continued to suffer from engine problems crossing the Atlantic, and on 17 September a depth charge-armed Swordfish crashed into her island on landing. After 75 minutes, they managed to safely drop the charge overboard. Arriving at Greenock on 23 June, she entered dock for modifications and to lengthen her wooden flight deck. On 2 September, she took part in landing trials with a Fairey Fulmar and practised landings and takeoffs with other Fleet Air Arm aircraft in the following weeks and exercised in oiling her escort vessels. On 1 October, Biter arrived in Scapa Flow, where she was joined on 10 October by . Her first fighters arrived on 14 October; 15 Sea Hurricanes belonging to No. 800 Naval Air Squadron. These planes were Sea Hurricane IB's armed with twelve machine guns and ICs armed with four 20 mm cannons. The two escort carriers‚Äîjoined by the fleet carrier ‚Äîleft for Greenock on 16 October to join the British forces taking part in the North Africa landings Operation Torch.Poolman (1972), p.55. Biter and Avenger seen from the deck of Victorious, which has two Supermarine Seafires on board. =Operation Torch= For the Torch landings, Biter was part of the covering force off Oran. The force comprised the battleship , the carriers and , the light cruiser and nine destroyers. Flying operations began on 8 November 1942, but after a Sea Hurricane crashed into her bridge Biter was temporarily put out of action. One Sea Hurricane was shot down by a Vichy French Dewoitine D.520. Both Biter and Dasher were sent back to Gibraltar on 10 November. Biter joined a convoy for Greenock and arrived without incident on 19 November and went to Dundee for an overhaul.Poolman (1972), p.56. In February 1943, Biter joined Argus and her destroyer escorts on an anti- submarine exercise and then left for Iceland on 13 April accompanied by the destroyers and arriving on 17 April.Poolman (1972), p.61. Along with HMS Pathfinder these ships formed 5th Support Group, commanded by Captain Conolly Abel-Smith. =Convoy ONS 4= Fairey Swordfish taking off from an escort carrier. Biter had taken aboard No. 811 Naval Air Squadron under Lieutenant- Commander A.J.B Forde. This was a composite squadron equipped with nine Fairey Swordfish and three Grumman Martlets. On 21 April, Biter departed Iceland with convoy ONS 4 bound for Argentia. Captain Abel-Smith had decided to shadow the convoy from a distance believing this would provide them with greater opportunities to engage shadowing U-boats. Two Swordfish were kept at immediate readiness to take off and engage any submarine sightings. On 23 April, one of the patrolling Swordfish sighted a U-boat on the surface but it had dived before they got into an attacking position. That same afternoon, another U-boat was sighted by the convoy; they signalled Biter, which was away. By the time the lone Swordfish dispatched had arrived, the U-boat‚Äî‚Äîhad been sunk by .Poolman (1972), pp.61‚Äì62. Biter kept up her anti-submarine patrols over the next days and on 25 April, the radar operator on Biter reported a submarine contact. The destroyer dispatched to investigate could not find anything, then at 16:25 a Swordfish sighted a U-boat on the surface only from Biter. Dropping two depth charges the Swordfish reported the sighting and another Swordfish and were sent to assist. Pathfinder followed up the Swordfish attack with depth charges of her own, and at 18:40 surfaced and was abandoned by her crew. The convoy safely reached Argentia on 19 April without any loss but had sunk two U-boats.Poolman (1972), pp.62‚Äì63. =Convoy HX 237= Grumman Martlet landing on board Biter and her destroyers left Argentia on 5 May to join the home bound convoy HX 237, which was escorted by 2nd Canadian Escort Group. At first Abel Smith refused to place his support group in the convoy but was subsequently ordered to do so by the Admiralty. Fog prevented any flying until 07:30 on 7 May, when two Swordfish took off and located the convoy and provided an anti-submarine patrol. The carrier and escorts arrived an hour later. Two Martlets which until now had been idle took part in a patrol but lost the convoy and had to ditch beside a straggling merchant ship which rescued the crews.Poolman (1972), p.63. Ordered to close with the convoy by the Commander-in Chief (C-in-C) Western Approaches bad weather prevented any flying until after 16:00 on 10 May. The Swordfish responded to a sighting of a U-boat on the surface dropping two depth charges but was hit by anti-aircraft fire from the submarine. A second Swordfish had taken off to assist but could not find the U-boat or the convoy in the bad weather and was forced to ditch beside a straggling merchant ship. On 11 May, a Swordfish engaged another U-boat on the surface which initially fought back with her guns but was eventually forced to dive. The next morning, the patrolling Swordfish reported a U-boat sighting and was never heard from again. It was because of these last engagements that aircraft were ordered to fly in pairs, they were forbidden to fight it out with surfaced submarines and only to attack if it was diving.Poolman (1972), p.64. That afternoon a Swordfish sighted and attacked a U-boat diving only from the convoy. The same U-boat‚Äî‚Äîwas located and sunk by two of the escorts, , a , and , a .Poolman (1972), p.65. On 13 May, the convoy had come within range of RAF Coastal Command Consolidated Liberators and Short Sunderlands. Two Swordfish took off at dawn and discovered two surfaced U-boats, which were attacked by a patrolling Sunderland of No.423 Squadron RCAF from RAF Castle Archdale. Another U-boat was located by a Swordfish at 09:00 and attacked as she was diving with no visible effect. Two U-boats were engaged by aircraft and escorts and sunk; these were U-456, sunk by HMS Opportune and a Liberator of No. 86 Squadron from RAF Aldergrove, and HMS Lagan, and U-753, sunk by the and HMS Lagan. View of the flight deck from a Swordfish that has just taken off. =Convoy SC 129= With HX 237 now under land-based aircraft cover, the C-in-C Western Approaches ordered Biter and her escorts south, where the eastbound convoy SC 129 was being threatened by a gathering wolfpack. On 15 May, light winds over the flight deck, and the inability of the Swordfish to use the catapult launch rail, limited their bomb load to two bombs. Just before they closed on the convoy a Swordfish attacked a surfaced U-boat. The two bombs caused no damage to the submarine which returned fire, damaging the plane and wounding the air observer. Their relief shadowed the submarine until it dived when it carried out another unsuccessful attack. At 13:45, Biter closed with the convoy and commenced anti-submarine patrols. The convoy reached Britain on 16 May without any loss, and Biter was ordered to the Clyde.Poolman (1972), p.66. As a result of Biter‚Ä≤s experiences on these early convoys, the complement of aircraft carried was increased to 15 bombers and six fighters, with a 50% increase in air crews. Homing beacons were to be fitted to all carriers together with a Type 237 blind approach beam system for use in poor visibility.Poolman (1972), p.70. =Convoy HX 265= On 19 October 1943, Biter with six Swordfish and six Martlets of No. 811 Naval Air Squadron on board left the Clyde to join the westbound convoy ON 207 which arrived at Argentia untroubled on 5 November.Poolman (1972), pp.104‚Äì106. They left Argentia on 7 November to support convoy HX 265. Biter was the lead ship in the 5th Support Group, with the destroyers , Opportune and Obdurate. They‚Äîtogether with the 7th Escort Group‚Äîwere tasked to sail and respectively ahead of the convoy. The intention was they would detect the two large concentrations of U-boats, that were known to be waiting for the next eastbound convoy.Poolman (1972), p.106. Aircraft from Biter made several U-Boat sightings but did not sink any; one was reported as probably being damaged on 10 November. On 16 November a Swordfish coming into land crashed into the sea behind Biter. The force of the crash released the plane's homing torpedo which detonated on the carrier's rudder. The explosion damaged the steering, rudder assembly and some hull plates below the waterline. Once she reached Britain, it took four weeks to repair the damage.Poolman (1972), pp.106‚Äì107. French service Biter was returned to the US Navy on 9 April 1945. She underwent a refit and was lent to the French Navy, where she was renamed Dixmude. The Flotille 3FB equipped with Douglas Dauntless dive bombers served on the ship between 1945 and 1949.Tillman (1998), P.84. On 24 January 1951 she was removed from the US Navy register and disarmed during her next refit between 1951‚Äì1953. She then became an accommodation ship until 1965, when she was returned to the US Navy, who sank her as a target ship on 10 June 1966.

The city is the main city of the Valle Latina (\\"Latin Valley\\"), an Italian geographical and historical region that extends from south of Rome to Cassino.Giuseppe Ponzi, Osservazioni geologiche fatte lungo la Valle Latina, Roma, 1849 History The first traces of human presence around modern Frosinone date from the Lower Paleolithic (around 250,000 years ago). The earliest settlements in the area are from around 4,000 years ago, including late Bronze Age remains in what is now the upper part of the city (12th-10th century BC) and 7th-6th century BC sepultures. 21 tombs from a Volscan necropolis were found in the Frosinone centre. Frusino (as it is called in ancient Latin sources) was part of the Hernici but its inhabitants were mostly Volscans. In 306 BC, the city took part in the Hernic League against Rome; defeated and sacked, it lost much of its territories to the nearby Ferentino. Later, during the Second Punic War, it was devastated by Hannibal's armies, to which it refused to surrender.Reported by Silius Italicus, VIII, 398 The Roman writer Cicero had a villa in Frusino. The city obtained the citizenship rights and became a colony in Roman imperial times, when part of its lands were assigned to Roman legionaries. Frosinone was the birthplace of two early Christian popes, Hormisdas and his son Silverius (6th century AD), who are now its patron saints. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Frosinone was destroyed several times by foreign invaders; in the early Middle Ages it was an agricultural center, usually of Papal allegiance. After escaping the dominance of the nearby commune of Anagni, in the early 14th century it fell under Alatri. In 1350, it was damaged by an earthquake. After the Sack of Rome (1527), Frosinone was also ravaged by German, Florentine and French troops and again, in 1556, by Spanish troops fighting against Pope Paul IV. The following year it became the official seat of the papal governor of the province of Campagna and Marittima. Frosinone steadily expanded its population in modern times, passing from around 2,000 people in the mid-17th century to the over 10,000 it had at the Unification of Italy (late 19th century). In 1863, it was connected to the national railway network. In 1927, the Fascist government made it the capital of a new province, created with territories from the provinces of Caserta and Rome. In 1943-1944, during the Allied invasion of southern occupied Italy in World War II, it was bombed 56 times by Anglo-American planes; the first Allied troops entered Frosinone on 31 May 1944. After the war, as the city was rebuilt in more modern lines, Frosinone lost its traditional agricultural role in favour of industry and, above all, tertiary (commercial) activities. In 1962, it was reached by the A1 Rome-Naples motorway. Geography Frosinone is on a hill overlooking the valley of the Sacco River, and is surrounded by the Ernici and Lepini mountain ranges.

She was originally the German merchant ship Hannover, which the Royal Navy captured in the West Indies in March 1940 and renamed Sinbad, then Empire Audacity. She was converted and commissioned as HMS Empire Audacity, then as HMS Audacity. She was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in late 1941. History =Hannover= SS Hannover listing before her capture on 6 March 1940 Hannover was a 5,537 GRT cargo liner built by Bremer Vulkan Schiff- und Maschinenbau, Vegesack and launched on 29 March 1939. She was owned by Norddeutscher Lloyd and plied between Germany and the West Indies on the banana run. Hannovers port of registry was Bremen. When World War II began, Hannover sought refuge in Cura√ßao, Netherlands Antilles. In March 1940,Hannover attempted to return to Germany as a blockade runner. She was sighted between Hispaniola and Puerto Rico on the night of 7/8 March by the light cruiser and the Canadian destroyer . Hannover was ordered to stop, but ignored the order and tried to reach the neutral waters of the Dominican Republic. When Dunedin and Assiniboine intercepted Hannover, Captain Wahnschaff ordered the seacocks opened and the ship set on fire. A boarding party from Dunedin closed the sea cocks and Hannover was taken under tow. However, it took four days for the salvage crew to put out the fire. Hannover was then towed to Jamaica, arriving on 11 March. Acting Lieutenant A. W. Hughes of Dunedin was mentioned in despatches for his part in securing Hannover. Damage was mainly confined to her electrical system. =Sinbad= Hannover was renamed Sinbad, given a UK Official Number and assigned new Code Letters. Her port of registry was changed to Kingston, Jamaica, under the British flag. First three letters appear to be VPL, fourth is illegible. Her cargo included 29 barrels of pickled sheep pelts, which were offered for sale by tender in August 1940 as a result of being declared as prize. =Empire Audacity= Sinbad was renamed Empire Audacity as one of the Empire ships of the Ministry of War Transport and was commissioned as an \\"Ocean Boarding Vessel\\" on 11 November. Her port of registry was changed to London. She was placed under the management of Cunard White Star Line Ltd. On 22 January 1941, she was sent to Blyth Dry Docks & Shipbuilding Co Ltd, Blyth to be rebuilt as an escort carrier. Britain did not have enough aircraft carriers and shipping was vulnerable to attacks by U-boats in the Mid-Atlantic Gap, where there was no air cover. The Admiralty decided that small carriers were part of the solution and had a number of merchantmen, including Empire Audacity, converted. Empire Audacity was the largest ship handled at Blyth, which was more used to ships of length. The townsfolk of Blyth wondered why the superstructure of a perfectly good ship was being scrapped at a time when Britain was desperately short of ships. Empire Audacity was commissioned on 17 June 1941. She was the Royal Navy's first escort carrier. =HMS Empire Audacity= HMS Empire Audacity worked up in the Clyde. The first deck landing was by a Grumman Martlet of 802 Naval Air Squadron (FAA) on 10 July. A detachment of aircraft were based on Empire Audacity from 19‚Äì21 July. All her aircraft had to be stored on the flight deck, as the hasty conversion into an escort carrier did not include a hangar deck. The Admiralty disliked her merchant name, and HMS Empire Audacity was renamed HMS Audacity on 31 July 1941. =HMS Audacity= Audacity was put into full service, embarking eight Martlets of No. 802 Squadron FAA. The use of only fighters was a major departure from later practice, where the main component was anti-submarine patrol aircraft, but she was used to support Gibraltar convoys and the only perceived threat was the German long-range Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor reconnaissance/bomber aircraft. Audacity participated in four convoys during her short career. ;OG 74 Convoy OG 74 sailed from Britain on 13 September 1941. A week later on 21 September the convoy was attacked by a German Condor bomber, whose bombs struck the convoy rescue ship . A fighter from Audacity was able to shoot down the bomber. The damage to Walmer Castle was extensive, and she had to be sunk by an escorting corvette. ;HG 74 Convoy HG 74 sailed from Gibraltar on 2 October and arrived at the Clyde on 17 October. The trip was uneventful. ;OG 76 Convoy OG 76 sailed on 28 October bound for Gibraltar. During the voyage, Martlets from Audacity shot down four Condors, one being the first aerial victory for Eric \\"Winkle\\" Brown. One Martlet was lost. ;HG 76 Convoy HG 76 sailed from Gibraltar on 14 December. Audacity had only four Martlet aircraft serviceable. The convoy came under attack from 12 U-boats. Martlets from Audacity shot down two Condors; was attacked on 17 December. U-131 shot down a Martlet, but was unable to dive after the attack, and was scuttled by her crew, who were taken prisoner. As Audacity left the convoy on the night of 21 December,Stated as 23 December in The Empire Ships one of the merchantmen fired a \\"snowflake\\" flare which revealed her in silhouette to the German U-boats. The submarines had been given specific orders to sink her as she had caused a lot of trouble for the Germans both at sea and in the air. The first torpedo fired by under Kapit√§nleutnant Gerhard Bigalk hit her in the engine room and she began to settle by the stern. The next two torpedoes caused an explosion of the aviation fuel blowing off her bow. Audacity sank some west of Cape Finisterre at . She sank in 70 minutes. 73 of her crew were killed.Don Kindell, Casualty Lists of the Royal Navy and Dominion Navies, World War 2. 15th ‚Äì 31st DECEMBER 1941 Her survivors were picked up by the corvettes , and , one of the survivors being pilot Eric Brown. The German commander had confused her with a , the sinking of which was announced by Nazi propaganda sources. In reality Audacity was an escort carrier of . Audacity had been operating outside the convoy, a procedure that was later prohibited by the Admiralty as too risky. Official number and code letters Official Numbers were a forerunner to IMO Numbers. Sinbad and Empire Audacity had the UK Official Number 156145. Hannover used the Code Letters DOBV. Empire Audacity used the Code Letters GLXZ. Model Model of Audacity in the Merseyside Maritime Museum. A model of HMS Audacity is displayed in the Merseyside Maritime Museum.

History The 2015-opened section in 2019 The east part of the Fitchburg Cutoff opened in 1870, connecting the Lexington and Arlington Railroad (Lexington Branch) to the Boston and Lowell Railroad.

In April 2014, state officials announced that a , $39 million extension of the Community Path to East Cambridge would be built as part of the Green Line Extension (GLX) project. Beginning in 2015, the state began a major re- evaluation of the GLX project due to singificantly increased costs. In May 2016, the state indicated that the Community Path would only be built as far as Washington Street in the revised plan to avoid a costly bridge. In some sections, the path would be lowered to track level to eliminate costly retaining walls, resulting in fewer connections to cross streets than previously planned. A consortium called GLX Constructors was selected as the winner for re-bid project in November 2017. Their proposal reduced costs enough to add the full Community Path extension back into the plan. However, the plans call for a -wide path, narrower than existing portions and the 12-foot width recommended in federal guidelines. Cycling advocates have raised concerns about safety of the narrowed path given the expected levels of bicycle traffic. The GLX and path extension are expected to be completed in late 2021.

She is best known for her tenure in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where she was a two-time WWE Women's Champion. She has also competed for the National Wrestling Alliance, where she held the NWA World Women's Championship for over 900 days.  Professional wrestling career  = Extreme Championship Wrestling (1999‚Äì2000) = After dropping out of college, Begnaud was approached about starting a career as a professional wrestler and joined a wrestling school in Louisiana. She was originally inspired to be a wrestler when she saw Jacqueline Moore perform. Begnaud trained with Rod Price for six to eight months, and she later made her professional wrestling debut in a match against Moore. Using the name Jazzmine, she later joined Extreme Championship Wrestling as a part of an alliance called the Impact Players, which included wrestlers such as Jason Knight, Lance Storm, and Justin Credible. She later began a feud with Jason and defeated him at Heat Wave in 1999. She appeared on a random basis before leaving the company before ECW was shut down due to bankruptcy. = World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment =  Training and Debut (2001)  In late 2001, the World Wrestling Federation expressed interest in Begnaud, and she was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling for six months to train. Under the new ring name Jazz, she signed a two-year contract with WWF. She made her debut in the company as a villain on the Survivor Series pay-per-view during a Six-Pack Challenge match for the WWF Women's Championship, which had been vacated by Chyna after her departure from the company. Ultimately, Trish Stratus was the winner for the match and the championship.  Women's Champion (2002)  Following her debut in the company, Jazz began her first rivalry with then- Women's Champion Trish Stratus as on the January 14, episode of Raw, Jazz received a push as she defeated Jacqueline to become the number one contender to Stratus' Women's title. Jazz received her championship match against Trish at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, where she was unsuccessful in capturing the title, however, on the February 4, 2002 episode of Raw, Jazz defeated Stratus to win the Women's Championship for the first time. On March 17, at WrestleMania X8, Jazz successfully defended her title against Lita and Trish Stratus in a triple‚Äìthreat match.

She made her return in‚Äìring action on the February 10 episode of Raw, defeating Molly Holly in a singles match. Jazz involved herself in the feud between Stratus and Victoria upon her return. She immediately took out Stratus and dominated in matches against Molly Holly and Jacqueline. She competed in a triple threat match for the Women's Championship at WrestleMania XIX against Stratus and Victoria, but Stratus walked away with the title. During this time, she took on the managerial services of Theodore Long, which led to another Women's Championship reign after defeating Stratus at Backlash. She had another successful title defence at Judgment Day in a Fatal Four-Way Match involving Stratus, Victoria and Jacqueline. However, she lost the title in a battle royal to Gail Kim on June 30. During the match, Jazz had sustained a chipped and dislocated shoulder and needed several weeks to rehabilitate. She returned from injury in early 2004, but was used sparingly.

Carlene has criticised WWE's marketing, claiming they undermarketed her and other wrestlers of color:  Championships and accomplishments  Jazz (left) and Marti Belle as the WSU Tag Team Champions in March 2011 *Cauliflower Alley Club **Women's Wrestling Award (2020)https://twitter.com/CACReunion/status/1219990392696795136 *Downsouth Championship Wrestling **DCW Louisiana State Championship (1 time) * Heavy on Wrestling **HOW Women's Championship (1 time)https://www.cagematch.net//?id=5&nr;=3923 *National Wrestling Alliance **NWA World Women's Championship (1 time) *NWA Cyberspace **NWA Cyberspace Women's Championship (1 time) *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **Ranked No. 13 of the best 50 female singles wrestlers in the PWI Female 50 in 2012 *Southwest Wrestling Entertainment **SWE Women's Championship (1 time) *Texas Wrestling Hall of Fame **Class of 2012 *Women Superstars Uncensored **WSU Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with Marti Belle **WSU Hall of Fame (Class of 2010) *Women's Extreme Wrestling **WEW World Championship (1 time) *World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment **WWF/E Women's Championship (2 times)  References   External links  Online World of Wrestling profile *WWE Alumni profile *Tha O Show Episode 181 Jazz Interview 1972 births Living people African-American female professional wrestlers American female professional wrestlers Professional wrestlers from Louisiana Sportspeople from New Orleans ","title":"Jazz (wrestler)"},{"id":"982687","text":"Krona is a fictional supervillain character that appears in comic books published by DC Comics. Publication history Krona first appeared in Green Lantern Vol. 2 #40 (Oct. 1965) and was created by writer John Broome and artist Gil Kane. Fictional character biography Born on Maltus, Krona is an Oan scientist who became obsessed with observing the origins of the universe itself, despite an ancient legend that said discovering that secret would cause a great calamity. Krona constructs a machine that pierces the temporal barrier and views the beginnings of time itself. Krona catches a glimpse of the hand of creation depositing the speck that would become the entire cosmos. His machine explodes at that instant, and the universe is shattered causing the creation of the Multiverse as the universe replicates into an infinite number of parallel universes. At this same moment, the Anti-Matter Universe is created, unleashing evil into the cosmos; thus, the Monitor and the Anti- Monitor are born. As punishment for this act, Krona is transformed into pure energy by his fellow Oans and is sent to forever wander the cosmos. Krona's actions are what caused the Oans to become the Guardians of the Universe.Green Lantern (vol. 1) #40 (Oct. 1965); Crisis on Infinite Earths #7‚Äì10 (October 1985 ‚Äì January 1986); History of the DC Universe #1 (1988); Green Lantern: Ganthet's Tale (March 1992); Zero Hour: Crisis in Time #4-0 (1994) Krona returns to a physical state using the energies of Alan Scott's mystical power ring, but is again turned into his energy form by the Guardians.Green Lantern #40 (vol. 1, Oct. 1965) Krona is finally restored to his original form thanks to Nekron‚Äîwho gained additional power due to the anomaly of an immortal entering the realm of the dead when the Guardians kill him‚Äîand attempts to kill all of the Guardians, only to be narrowly defeated by the weakened Green Lantern Corps.Tales of the Green Lantern Corps #1‚Äì3 (May‚ÄìJuly 1981) Krona later resurfaces as the manifestation of Entropy itself and battles the New Guardians.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #32‚Äì35 (November 1992 ‚Äì January 1993) =Cross-universal threat= While trying to discover the secret of universal creation, Krona destroys entire universes, eventually arriving in the Marvel Universe. There he confronts the Grandmaster,JLA/Avengers #1 (September 2003) who, in an attempt to save his own universe, informs Krona of the existence of a being in the Marvel Universe who has witnessed the Big Bang. In exchange for Krona not destroying this universe, the Grandmaster and he will play a game; two teams, one from each universe, seek out 12 items of great power, six from each universe. Should Krona's team (the Avengers) win, Grandmaster will give the knowledge Krona seeks to him in return for not destroying his universe. But when Grandmaster's team (the Justice League) wins‚Äîthanks in part to Batman, Captain America and the Atom having discovered the nature of the game in time to ensure that the League wins instead of declaring a draw‚ÄîKrona strikes down the Grandmaster in a rage, draining his knowledge to learn the identity of the being he spoke of, allowing him to summon Galactus. He then repeats the process with Galactus,JLA/Avengers #2 (October 2003) but the Grandmaster tricks him and uses the power of the collected items to lock Krona at the multiversal junction point, having linked the two universes together.JLA/Avengers #3 (November 2003) The Grandmaster's hopes are dashed, though, when it becomes evident Krona would continue even in his extremely dangerous location in his insane quest to view the birth of a universe despite the risks posed to himself. Even from there, he continued his onslaught to destroy both the Marvel and DC universes in order to create a new one, so that he could watch creation first-hand. He forces them closer together, causing reality to warp wildly, and even making items and people switch worlds. He is briefly disrupted by the efforts of the Scarlet Witch and Green Lantern, but then continues his experiments. After being told what has happened by a dying Grandmaster, the two teams get to Krona's stronghold, led by Captain America and coordinated by the Martian Manhunter, pitting them against various brainwashed villains and increasing the scale of his 'recruits' as the heroes defeat each wave. He nearly kills all the heroes of both teams as they penetrate his final wave of defenses‚Äîeven with Superman wielding Captain America's shield and Thor's hammer‚Äî but Hawkeye and the Flash (Barry Allen), who had earlier faked their deaths, stop his plan, Hawkeye firing a TNT arrow at Krona's machinery. The blast was immense, and ended up sucking Krona into the universe seed called the Cosmic Egg. The Spectre then pushes the worlds apart and reality returns to normal.JLA/Avengers #4 (December 2003) This egg is kept and studied in the JLA headquarters. Its fluctuations are a matter of intense scrutiny in the \\"Syndicate Rules\\" storyline,JLA #107‚Äì114 (December 2004‚ÄìJuly 2005) during which it is speculated that the reconstruction of the universes also altered the original 'rules' that allowed the League and the Syndicate to always win on their home ground, requiring each to fight harder in the future. After the League believes they have the situation under control, they implement tighter scans on the egg, to register alarms at even the most minor of fluctuations. At the end of the storyline, the New God Metron places several devices around the egg, so as to feed false readings to the League and to let the egg develop without interference. =Trinity= The Cosmic Egg is taken by Despero in the Trinity series.Trinity #7 It is used by Despero, Morgaine le Fey and Enigma to create powerful monsters, and was later used in a ritual to reshape the world.Trinity #17 In the aftermath of these events, Krona is freed. He recruits some Controllers in an attempt to communicate with the consciousness of the universe, but is double-crossed by them, who attempt to absorb and study his energies. In retaliation, Krona destroys them and their lab planet, only to hear the planet's consciousness \\"freed\\" from its \\"prison\\". Krona then sets out to do the same for many other planets.Trinity #20 Krona is later approached by Morgaine and her allies, seeking his power to fend off the returned Trinity (Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman). Morgaine offers the planet Earth's consciousness in return, intending to replace it with the soul of Enigma's daughter.Trinity #45 Krona accepts and a lengthy battle ensues between him, the JLA, JSA, Titans, Teen Titans, the God-like trinity consisting of Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman, and other various heroes, aliens and villains. During the height of the battle Krona is imprisoned due to the united efforts of several heroes and villains, but is set free by Morgaine, finally snapped, claiming that if she cannot have the world, then nobody shall. Following that, Krona unleashes his powers and destroys the Earth. Moments after Earth's destruction he encounters its essence, the Worldsoul, which continuously alters its form between a little girl, an adult woman and an old hag. Krona inquires about the law of universes, wishing to know how the Worldsoul and other entities like it function and exist, hoping to learn of some higher plan or design. However, he is horrified to learn that the Worldsoul has no actual function other than to simply exist, resonate and, most importantly, to feel, to share in the positive emotions of every lifeform that dwells upon its surface, at one with the Universe in a Great Dance with the other souls of worlds. This explanation, such as it is, defies all logic and science Krona has studied, and he believes this renders himself and his entire life, in effect, pointless. In a fit of rage, he attempts to destroy the Worldsoul, but is stopped by the Trinity, who have survived the destruction of Earth. Combining their powers with that of the Worldsoul, they imprison Krona and reform the Earth, restoring everything and everyone to the way it was prior to its destruction, even the supervillains of the planet.Trinity #50 Krona's ultimate fate was to be remade as the Worldsoul of Earth-1, this time imprisoned for all eternity. =War of the Green Lanterns= After the events of the Blackest Night, a cloaked stranger appears on Ryut, walking near an ancient temple with seven pillars marked with the symbols of the Emotional Spectrum and plotting against the Lantern Corps.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #53 (May 2010) The first act of this stranger's plan occurs with the abduction of the fear entity, Parallax, during the finale of \\"Blackest Night\\", imprisoning the creature within the pillar marked with the symbol of the Sinestro Corps. He then proceeds to remove the willpower entity, Ion, from Sodam Yat, effectively turning Daxam's sun from yellow back to red and killing hundreds of Daxamites in the process,Green Lantern (vol. 4) #54 (June 2010) and later helps Hector Hammond get out of prison, to pursue the Avarice Entity which is trapped inside Larfleeze's lantern.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #56 (June 2010) The stranger is also shown working with Hank Henshaw (Cyborg Superman), telling him that enslaving and altering the qualities of the Alpha Lanterns will restore his mortality. He is also shown working with the telepathic Zardor in his plot to brainwash rookie members of the Green Lantern Corps that will lead to the destruction of the Green Lantern Corps.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #50 (July 2010) The stranger also freed Lyssa Drak from the Book of the Black, and informs her that her assistance is required since another book will soon be made and a keeper is needed.Untold Tales of Blackest Night (October 2010) The stranger later appears on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States‚Äîwith an obedient Parallax in tow‚Äîwhere he faces Hal Jordan, Nicole Morrison, Larfleeze, Saint Walker and the Indigo Tribe, seeking to obtain both the hope entity, Adara, and the compassion entity, Proselyte, for his collection. When the figure captures the entities by ripping Proselyte and Adara from their hosts, he is confronted by Jordan. The figure finally reveals himself as Krona, the rogue Guardian, long believed dead ‚Äì the bandages serving to help restore his body after the damage he has sustained in his previous encounters ‚Äì and tells Jordan that prior to his banishment by the Guardians, he was the caretaker responsible for protecting the entities, which explains how he's aware of the orange power of avarice and its location as revealed during Hal Jordan's first encounter with Larfleeze,Green Lantern (vol. 4) #60 (December 2010) and that is why he can control them and the abilities they possess. Despite the combined efforts of the New Guardians (sans Sinestro and Carol Ferris), Krona still managed to overwhelm them with the assistance of Ophidian. Immobilized by Ophidian's disruptive powers, Krona discovered the location of the Butcher from the avarice entity, and expunged it from Atrocitus's power battery. As Hal struggled with his defiance, Krona unleashed the power of all of the entities, effectively defeating the New Guardians. Having no other reason for staying on Earth, Krona left with the entities in tow.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #62 (March 2011) Later, as Hal Jordan, Larfleeze, Atrocitus, Saint Walker, Indigo-1 and a returned Sinestro tried to reach Zamaron, since the entity of love was the only one still free, they found instead a delusional Carol Ferris who tells them that Krona had captured the Predator. Through Indigo-1 they follow Krona to the dead planet of Ryut where they found the Book of the Black, which after detecting the presence of the \\"New Guardians\\" opened its pages to unveil the history of Krona, revealing that it was Krona that was responsible for the Manhunters' programming glitch, which resulted in the annihilation of Sector 666. He did it to prove that there were flaws in an emotionless police force. He was also the one who created a gauntlet that harnessed Willpower which was the basis for the Green Lantern Power Ring. When he became the keeper of the emotional entities, he used the gauntlet to harness their powers and named it the Gauntlet of Power, since it could harness all emotions.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #63 (April 2011) In the War of the Green Lanterns, Krona, along with the emotional entities, launched an attack on Oa, attacking the six remaining Guardians (with Ganthet working in the Anti-Matter universe at the time), by having them possessed by all the entities, except for Parallax, who is placed inside the Central Power Battery. With the yellow impurity returned to the Central Power Battery, all of the Green Lanterns‚Äîeven the experienced wielders, with the apparent exception of the Green Lanterns who had been possessed by Parallax before‚Äîare placed under Krona's control, revealing that they could not overcome the fear associated with it as the Guardians had thought. Even the Alpha Lanterns are affected by the yellow impurity which made them enter into some kind of hibernation.Green Lantern Corps #58 (March 2011) The former Guardian then declares that he will show the universe the true power of the Green Lanterns. However, despite his attempts to stop them by using Mogo against them, Hal Jordan, John Stewart, Guy Gardner and Kyle Rayner are able to escape Krona and fight back by using the rings of the other Corps ‚Äî Hal wielding a Sinestro and an Orange ring, Guy a Red and a Star Sapphire, Kyle a Blue, and John an Indigo ‚Äî to escape Parallax's influence long enough to kill MogoGreen Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #60 (May 2011) and extract Parallax from the Power Battery.Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors #10 (May 2011) Undaunted, Krona uses all seven varieties of power ring at once, attacking Hal Jordan and the freed Sinestro (who had just been selected by another green ring). Despite his greater power, Krona is eventually killed by Hal Jordan.Green Lantern (Vol. 4) #67 (July 2011) Afterwards, the Guardians of the Universe then wish to honor the fallen Guardian by putting him in the crypt on Oa, along with other dead Lanterns. Many Lanterns disagree with their decision and journey to the Crypt where they encounter Salaak creating a space for Krona. Later, Ganthet honors his promise to Atrocitus and gives Krona's corpse to him to do as he wishes.War of the Green Lanterns: Aftermath #2 (August 2011) =The New 52= Following the War of the Green Lanterns, it is revealed that Atrocitus has kept Krona's corpse as a 'confidant', talking to the body when he needs to give voice to his feelings about the Red Lantern Corps and his plans to upgrade their intelligence. However, after granting intellects to three Red Lanterns, Atrocitus returns to the place where he has left Krona's body only to find it gone.Red Lanterns #4 (December 2011) Although Atrocitus attempts to find Krona's body, he is left to consider both the worrying possibility that Krona has come back to life,Red Lanterns #5 (January 2012) when faced with a revolt from Bleez, Atrocitus starts to wonder if the loss of Krona's body has robbed him of the focus of his rage, as he has begun to try and justify his actions where he previously considered his mere identity enough of a justification.Red Lanterns #6 (February 2012) Krona's body, however, is found to be possessed by Abysmus, a demonic entity created by the earliest experiments of Atrocitus with shamanistic and necromantic magic, who willingly ate his body and flayed his skin to empower himself and a race of similar creatures, the so-called Abysmorphs.Red Lanterns #7 (March 2012) Following the events of 'Rise of the Third Army', in the opening of 'Wrath of the First Lantern', it is revealed that Krona's history has been changed: although he attempted to observe the beginning of the universe, the cosmos-spanning hand now bears a Lantern Power ring and when the viewscreen explodes, it is because a time-travelling ship has just arrived. From the ship, appears the mysterious Volthoom.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #17 (February 2013) During a conversation with Atrocitus, Krona's spirit-which manifests as a result of Abysmus's manipulations-claims that he became caught up in his work after his wives and child were killed in an accident, but Atrocitus dismisses the idea that this excuses his later actions; moments later, the newly freed Volthoom disperses Krona's spirit, apparently ending the last remnants of his existence.Red Lanterns #17 It was also revealed that Krona's banishment from the Guardians of the Universe was not from the result of his machinations, but because he issued the order to the Manhunters to destroy Sector 666.Red Lanterns #17 (February 2013) =The Lost Army= A very alive Krona later finds John Stewart, Kilowog, Arisia, Two-Six and new Lantern Xrill-Vrek in a seemingly hostile territory, a long way from home. Given that this Krona is back to his Maltusan look, does not recognize any of the Green Lanterns and that the Green Lantern rings cannot locate anyone or the Central Power Battery, provides a little clue as to what has happened. Either they have been displaced to another universe, another time, or both.Green Lanterns: Lost Army #1 Powers and abilities Krona possesses a supreme genius-level intellect, but his arrogance, lack of patience, short temper and above all insatiable hunger for knowledge have gotten the better of him. If it brought him any benefit, he would be the sort to attempt to quantify dance or measure a soul, solely for the sake of knowing. It is this madness that got Krona exiled and brought about his constant defeats. He has unhesitatingly destroyed universes and risked his own existence for a chance to gain deeper insight. Like the rest of his species, Krona possesses enhanced physical abilities, vast psionic powers (including telepathy and telekinesis) and virtual immortality (he does not need to breathe, eat or sleep, and can regenerate from any injury at an accelerated rate). His powers were later increased by Nekron, making him more powerful than any of the Guardians. As Entropy, Krona was composed of anti-energy, could absorb others into his body, converting them into more anti-energy, and was able to create an army composed of anti-energy that were completely under his control. During the JLA/Avengers miniseries, where he wielded the power of all the universes he had previously destroyed, Krona proved able to easily defeat both the Grandmaster and Galactus, although the Grandmaster's power was sufficient to make him initially hesitant at the prospect of fighting the other being until his attempt to beat the Grandmaster in a game to gain the information he sought failed. Also, as the caretaker of the Emotional entities which are the pure embodiments of the emotions comprising the Emotional Spectrum, Krona wields the powers of the entire emotional spectrum. In other media =Television= Krona appears in the Green Lantern: The Animated Series episode \\"Loss\\". He is seen during a flashback sequence detailing the creation of the Anti-Monitor on Maltus. =Film= * Krona appears in the 2011 live-action film Green Lantern voiced by Clancy Brown. In the film, he is a rogue Guardian of the Universe, who accidentally unleashed and was consumed by Parallax. His name is revealed in the special features included in the Blu-ray edition under the featurette \\"The Guardians Revealed\\". * Krona appears in the film Green Lantern: Emerald Knights. In the movie, he created the Anti-Matter universe billions of years ago threatening all creation. As punishment, he was turned into energy and cast out through the cosmos. However, he reconstituted himself in the Anti-Matter universe and returned via a portal from the Oan sun. In the film's climax, he appears as a gigantic Anti-Matter entity controlling Shadow Demons. Arisia figured out that they have to hit him with matter of equal or greater mass. The Lanterns decided to use the planet Oa itself as a weapon against Krona. All of the Green Lanterns, including Mogo, used their rings to throw Oa and slam Krona into the sun to eliminate him for good. =Video games= Krona appears in DC Universe Online as the final boss in the Oan Sciencells alert and also as the Round 10 boss for the Survival Mode: Oan Sciencells event.

AFMBE is one of the first RPGs to focus on zombies as the main aspect of survival horror. While other games do have zombies, AFMBE was the first to make them central. AFMBE was also the first new Unisystem game produced by Eden under their exclusive licenses of the Unisystem game. The main rule book details character creation, skills, qualities (positive characteristics), drawbacks (negative characteristics), zombie creation rules, character archetypes and several campaign settings (called \\"Deadworlds\\" in the jargon of the game). The game has a large following and several expansion books. AFMBE genre books also serve double duty as expansions to the Classic Unisystem rules for various movie, TV and literature genres, such as the Western, pulp fiction, and sci-fi.

Vindicators still remained in service at the time of the Battle of Midway, but by 1943, all had been withdrawn to training units. It was known as the Chesapeake in Royal Navy service. Design and development In 1934, the United States Navy issued a requirement for a new Scout Bomber for carrier use, and received proposals from six manufacturers. The specification was issued in two parts, one for a monoplane, and one for a biplane. Vought submitted designs in both categories, which would become the XSB2U-1 and XSB3U-1 respectively. The biplane was considered alongside the monoplane design as a \\"hedge\\" against the U.S. Navy's reluctance to pursue the modern configuration.McKillop, Jack. \\"Chance-Vought SB2U Vindicator\\". The Pacific War: The U.S. Navy. Archived from the original at \\"Chance-Vought SB2U Vindicator\\". on 9 October 2007. The XSB2U-1 was of conventional low-wing monoplane configuration with a retractable conventional tailwheel landing gear, the pilot and tail gunner being seated in tandem under a long greenhouse-style canopy. The fuselage was of steel tube construction, covered with aluminum panels from the nose to the rear cockpit with a fabric-covered rear fuselage, while the folding cantilever wing was of all-metal construction. A Pratt & Whitney R-1535 Twin-Wasp Junior radial engine drove a two-blade constant-speed propeller, which was intended to act as a dive brake during a dive bombing attack. The use of propeller braking was not entirely successful, and in practice US Navy Vindicators lowered the aircraft's undercarriage to act as a speed brake and dived at shallower angles. A single 1,000 lb (450 kg) bomb could be carried on a swinging trapeze to allow it to clear the propeller in a steep dive, while further bombs could be carried under the wings to give a maximum bombload of 1,500 lb (680 kg).Green and Swanborough 1978, pp. 2‚Äì3.Wixey 2000, pp. 64‚Äì65. The SB2U was evaluated against the Brewster XSBA-1, Curtiss XSBC-3, Great Lakes XB2G-1, Grumman XSBF-1 and Northrop XBT-1. All but the Great Lakes and Grumman submissions were ordered into production. Designated XSB2U-1, one prototype was ordered on 15 October 1934 and was delivered on 15 April 1936. Accepted for operational evaluation on 2 July 1936, the prototype XSB2U-1, BuNo 9725, crashed on 20 August 1936.Larkins, William T., \\"U.S. Navy Aircraft 1921-1941, U.S. Marine Corps Aircraft 1914-1959\\", Orion Books, New York, 1988, Library of Congress card number 88-17753, , page 196. Its successful completion of trials led to further orders, with 56 SB2U-1s ordered on 26 October 1936,Green and Swanborough 1978, p. 3. and a further 58 of a slightly modified version, the SB2U-2, on 6 October 1938.Green and Swanborough 1978, p. 6. The SB2U-3 was a more heavily modified version, intended as a long-range scout bomber, capable of being fitted with a conventional wheeled undercarriage, for operations from aircraft carriers of land airbases, or with floats. To give the required increased range, the fuselage fuel tank fitted to the SB2U-1 and -2 was supplemented by integral wing tanks, while the aircraft's tail had an increased span. The prototype XSB2U-3, converted from the last SB2U-1, flew in February 1939, and after testing as both a landplane and floatplane, 57 SB2U-3s were ordered on 25 September 1939, mainly for the US Marine Corps.Green and Swanborough 1978, p. 76.Wixey 2000, pp. 67‚Äì68. The SB2U is prominently featured in the 1941 film Dive Bomber. There were 260 examples of all Vindicator variants produced, and a single example is preserved at the National Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola, Florida. Operational history =U.S. Navy= SB2U destroyed at Pearl Harbor SB2U from in November 1941. SB2U-3 of VMSB-241, MAG-21, takes off from Eastern Island shortly before the Battle of Midway. SB2U-3s on deck of in June 1942. Deliveries to the US Navy began in December 1937, when four aircraft joined VB-3 aboard the aircraft carrier , replacing Curtiss BFC-2 biplanes. As well as Saratoga, Vindicators served on the carriers , , and .Green and Swanborough 1978, pp. 5‚Äì6. Air Group Nine, destined for , trained in Vindicators aboard the escort carrier , but they transitioned to the Douglas SBD Dauntless before Essex joined the war. During the attack on Pearl Harbor, seven Vindicators from the U.S. squadron VMSB-231 were destroyed at Ewa Field. =U.S. Marine Corps= VMSB-131 and VMSB-241 were the only two USMC squadrons that fielded the Marine-specific SB2U-3 between March 1941 and September 1943. VMSB-241's Vindicators saw combat at the Battle of Midway in June 1942. Airmen with experience in more modern aircraft spoke disparagingly of SB2Us as \\"vibrators\\" or \\"wind indicators\\" in their later combat assignments.O'Rourke, G.G, CAPT USN. \\"Of Hosenoses, Stoofs, and Lefthanded Spads\\". United States Naval Institute Proceedings, July 1968.Spangenburg, Walt, CAPT USN. \\"Comment and Discussion\\". United States Naval Institute Proceedings, October 1968. Captain Richard E. Fleming piloted a SB2U-3 Vindicator in an attack on the Japanese cruiser Mikuma on 5 June 1942, for which he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. =French Navy= Based on the SB2U-2, the V-156-F incorporated specific French equipment. Briefly after the deliveries started in July 1939, V-156-F crews were trained for carrier operations aboard the French carrier , but when the war broke out the old carrier was declared too slow for operational service. As a result, V-156-F-equipped units escadrilles AB 1 and AB 3 were based ashore when the Battle of France started. AB 1 sustained heavy losses while attacking bridges and German ground targets in Northern France, as well as providing air cover for the Evacuation of Dunkirk. AB 3's V-156-Fs were briefly engaged against the Italians, during which time they were credited with possibly sinking one submarine off Albenga. By the time of the Armistice, there were only a handful of remaining Voughts in French hands, and the type was phased out of service. =Royal Navy= France had placed an order for a further 50 V-156-Fs in March 1940, with delivery planned from March 1941. Following the defeat of France, this order was taken over by the British government for use by the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm, who named the aircraft the Chesapeake.Green and Swanborough 1978, p.8. The British required several modifications to the Chesapeake, including the additional fuel tank fitted to the SB2U-3, additional armor and heavier forward firing armament, with four rifle caliber machine guns replacing the single forward-firing Darne machine gun of the French aircraft.Green and Swanborough 1978, p.74. Fourteen Chesapeakes were used to equip a reformed 811 Naval Air Squadron on 14 July 1941 at RNAS Lee-on-Solent.Thetford 1978, p.340. The squadron, whose crews referred to it as the \\"cheesecake\\", intended to use them for anti-submarine patrols, and they were earmarked for the escort carrier . By the end of October that year, it had been decided that the Chesapeakes were underpowered for the planned duties and would not be able to lift a sensible payload from the small escort carriers. Accordingly, they were withdrawn from 811 Squadron in November 1941 for use as training aircraft and the unit was re-equipped with the biplane Fairey Swordfish.

He went from being an illiterate adult to inventing a series of writing systems for his native language and then producing translations of the Bible and other religious works in a period of five years.Walker, Willard B. 1996. Native writing systems. Handbook of North American Indians, vol 17: Languages, ed. by Ives Goddard. Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Uyaquq was born into a family of shamans in the lower Kuskokwim River valley of central Alaska in the mid-1860s.Alley, James. 1991. Biography of Helper Neck. Alaska Native Language Archive, item CY(MOR)991A1991 Even by the standards of the day, Uyaquk was a small man. He became a shaman in early adulthood, but converted to Christianity after his father converted. Although his father became a Russian Orthodox, Uyaquk became a leader and missionary in the Alaskan Moravian Church. His name means \\"Neck\\"Jacobson, Steven A. (2012). Yup'ik Eskimo Dictionary, 2nd edition. Alaska Native Language Center. in English and he was called that by some English speakers. As a missionary, Uyaquq is said to have converted whole villages of Yupik in the lower Kuskokwim River valley to Christianity. He is said to have had a gentle personality and have been a very erudite speaker. Uyaquq was fascinated by the idea that the English-speaking Moravians could quote a passage of scripture several times using exactly the same words each time. He discovered that they accomplished this by reading from a written text. Uyaquk became fascinated with the idea of writing and, according to his descendants, received the idea for the first version of the script he used to write his dialect, Yugtun, in a dream. Reverend John Hinz, a Moravian missionary in Alaska, and an accomplished linguist, was astonished upon hearing of Uyaquq's invention. Hinz took Uyaquq to the Bethel mission house so that he could continue his linguistic work. Uyaquq is said to have written constantly during the trip, writing as many stories from the Bible as he could in the new script without stopping to sleep. Hinz and the Kilbucks aided Uyaquq by telling him scriptures, but Uyaquq refused to learn to read or write English, as he thought that English literacy would make him lose his identity as a Yupik. In the next five years, Uyaquq's Yugtun script evolved from its original form of pictographs to a syllabary. This evolution began when Uyaquq decided that his hieroglyphics were a good memory aid but they did not represent passages with enough accuracy that they could be reproduced verbatim time after time. Uyaquq identified the concept of a syllable and his script evolved in five stages until he had created a symbol for each syllable in the language. Each of the five steps was documented in several notebooks kept by Uyaquq. He taught his writing system to several of his missionary helpers and they used it in their church work. Although the system adopted by most people for writing Yupik was the Roman-based script of Reverend Hinz, and, in about 1970, the University of Alaska system, Uyaquq's system has been studied because it may represent the same process of evolution from illiteracy to proto-writing to syllabary taken by many ancient written languages, like Chinese and Egyptian, but compressed into a period of five years. Uyaquq's notebooks and the writings of those who watched him at work have been the subject of research, beginning with Dr. Alfred Schmitt in the 1930s.Schmitt, Alfred. 1951.

While primarily a vocalist and guitarist, he also plays harmonica, piano, and bass guitar. After leading the Soft Boys in the late 1970s and releasing the influential Underwater Moonlight, Hitchcock launched a prolific solo career. His musical and lyrical styles have been influenced by Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Syd Barrett, Captain Beefheart, Bryan Ferry and Roger McGuinn. Hitchcock's lyrics tend to include surrealism, comedic elements, characterisations of English eccentrics, and melancholy depictions of everyday life. He has recorded for two major American labels (A&M; Records, then Warner Bros.) over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, and was the subject of a live performance/documentary film (Storefront Hitchcock) by major motion picture director Jonathan Demme in 1998, but despite this, mainstream success has been limited. He has earned strong critical reviews over a steady stream of album releases and live performances, and a \\"cult following\\" for his songs. Career =The Soft Boys to the Egyptians (1972‚Äì1993)= Hitchcock was educated at Winchester College, where he was a \\"groovy and alternative\\" friend of Julia Darling. While at art school in London around 1972, Hitchcock was a member of the college band the Beetles. In 1974 he moved to Cambridge, where he did some busking, and joined a series of local bands: B.B. Blackberry and the Swelterettes, the Worst Fears, and Maureen and the Meatpackers. His next group, Dennis and the Experts, became the neo-psychedelia band The Soft Boys in 1976, recording their first EP, \\"Give It to the Soft Boys\\", at Spaceward studios, Cambridge, in 1977. After recording A Can of Bees (1979) and Underwater Moonlight (1980), the latter of which was described in Rolling Stone as a \\"classic\\" and influential on bands such as R.E.M. and The Replacements, the group broke up in 1981. In 1981 Hitchcock released his solo debut, Black Snake Diamond R√∂le, which included instrumental backing by several former Soft Boys. He followed it in 1982 with the generally critically maligned Groovy Decay.The Rough Guide to Rock, Peter Buckley, 2003 Following his solo acoustic album I Often Dream of Trains in 1984, he formed a new band, The Egyptians, comprising former members of the Soft Boys (Andy Metcalfe and Morris Windsor, supplemented at first by early keyboardist Roger Jackson), resulting in their 1985 debut Fegmania!, which featured typically surrealist Hitchcock songs such as \\"My Wife and My Dead Wife\\" and \\"The Man with the Lightbulb Head.\\" (A live album, Gotta Let This Hen Out!, was released at the end of that year.) Their popularity grew with the 1986 album Element of Light and they were subsequently signed to A&M; Records in the U.S. The album Globe of Frogs, released in 1988, further expanded their reach, as the single \\"Balloon Man\\" became a college radio and MTV hit, followed in 1989 by \\"Madonna of the Wasps\\" from their Queen Elvis album. In 1989 they also teamed up with Peter Buck of R.E.M. and Peter Holsapple of The dB's, playing two gigs as Nigel and the Crosses, mostly covers. At the beginning of 1990, Hitchcock took a break from the Egyptians and A&M; Records to release another solo acoustic album, Eye, then resumed with the band's Perspex Island release in 1991. 1993's Respect, influenced a great deal by his father's death, marked the last Egyptians release and the end of his association with A&M; Records. =Reunions and solo career, 1994‚Äì2006= Early in 1994, after disbanding the Egyptians, Hitchcock embarked on a short reunion tour with the Soft Boys. His work received a slight boost in 1995 when his back catalogue (including both solo releases and Egyptians albums) were re-packaged and re-issued in the United States by the respected Rhino Records label. For the rest of the decade he continued recording and performing as a solo artist, releasing several albums on Warner Brothers Records, such as 1996's Moss Elixir (which featured the contributions of violinist Deni Bonet and guitarist Tim Keegan), and the soundtrack from the Jonathan Demme-directed concert film Storefront Hitchcock in 1998. The 1999 release Jewels for Sophia, also on Warner, featured cameos from Southern California-based musicians Jon Brion and Grant-Lee Phillips, both of whom often shared the stage with Hitchcock when he played Los Angeles nightclub Largo. An album of outtakes from the Sophia sessions called A Star for Bram, released on Hitchcock's own label, followed, and his subsequent albums appeared on a variety of independent labels. In 2000 the Italian music writer Luca Ferrari released a long interview with Hitchcock, A Middle Class Hero (Stampa Alternativa), in the form of a 96 page booklet in English and Italian accompanying a three-song CD of unreleased tracks. In 2001 Hitchcock reunited and toured with Kimberley Rew, bassist Matthew Seligman, and Morris Windsor for the Soft Boys' re-release of their best-known album, 1980's Underwater Moonlight. The following year they recorded and released a new album, Nextdoorland, which was accompanied by a short album of outtakes, Side Three. The reunion was short-lived. The 2002 double album Robyn Sings comprised cover versions of Bob Dylan songs, including a live re-creation (performed in 1996) of Dylan's so-called Live at the Royal Albert Hall 1966 concert. Hitchcock celebrated his 50th birthday in 2003 with a concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London at which his then-new solo acoustic album Luxor was given away as a gift to all those attending, and an original poem of his was read by actor Alan Rickman. He continued collaborating with a series of different musicians, as on the album Spooked, which was recorded with country/folk duo (and longtime Hitchcock fans) Gillian Welch and David Rawlings. The Soft Boys re-formed again in 2006 to perform a live concert of Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd covers in London, benefiting M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res. =The Venus 3 to present= Hitchcock at Coolidge Corner Theatre in 2010 In 2006 Ol√©! Tarantula was released with the Venus 3, a band which consisted of longtime friends and collaborators R.E.M.'s Peter Buck and Young Fresh Fellows' frontman Scott McCaughey, as well as Ministry's Bill Rieflin (by then also R.E.M.'s full-time drummer). The song \\"'Cause It's Love (Saint Parallelogram)\\" was written with Andy Partridge of XTC. In 2007, he was the subject of a documentary Robyn Hitchcock: Sex, Food, Death... and Insects directed by John Edginton, shown on the U.S. Sundance Channel and in the UK on BBC Four (and later released on DVD). \\"Food, sex and death are all corridors to life if you like. You need sex to get you here, you need food to keep you here and you need death to get you out and they‚Äôre the entry and exit signs.\\" The filmmaker eavesdrops on Hitchcock at work on his latest collection of songs with contributors including Nick Lowe, former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones, Peter Buck and Gillian Welch. The film culminates with Hitchcock and the band taking the songs on the road in America. A live EP with The Venus 3, Sex, Food, Death... and Tarantulas, was released in conjunction with the documentary. The film also includes candid interviews with Hitchcock, who reveals much about the source of his work: \\"At heart I'm a frightened angry person. That's probably why my stuff isn't totally insubstantial. I'm constantly, deep down inside, in a kind of rage.\\" Late in 2007, Hitchcock's music was again re-packaged and re-released in the U.S., as Yep Roc Records began an extensive reissue campaign with three early solo releases and a double-CD compilation of rarities, which would be available separately or as part of a new boxed set release, I Wanna Go Backwards. In 2008, that boxed set was followed up with Luminous Groove, a boxed set of three early Egyptians releases and two further discs of rarities. In 2009, the electro-pop artist and remixer Pocket released an EP featuring Hitchcock called \\"Surround Him With Love\\", while Hitchcock released an entirely separate new album, Goodnight Oslo, with the Venus 3. At the end of the year, a live album called I Often Dream of Trains in New York documented the late-2008 onstage re-creation of his acclaimed 1984 acoustic album (a limited-edition deluxe version also included the materials to construct a kind of moving-image generator called a phenakistoscope). In 2009, Hitchcock contributed to The Decemberists' concept album The Hazards of Love, performing the short instrumental solo \\"An Interlude.\\" Also in 2009, Hitchcock provided the score for the film Women in Trouble, a feminist/exploitation \\"chick flick\\". Concurrent with the redesign of his official website in early 2010, Hitchcock began to offer a series of \\"Phantom 45s\\" as downloads, each \\"45\\" being two newly recorded songs that would initially be offered as a free download. He also released the Propellor Time album, containing new material partially based on the \\"Sex, Food, Death\\" sessions shown in the 2007 documentary, but mainly featuring the Venus 3. In 2011, he released Troms√∏, Kaptein, an album of songs written in Norway, and released physically only in that country. Hitchcock was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform \\"I Often Dream of Trains\\" at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival, to be curated by Mangum in March 2012 in Minehead, England. The album Love From London (working title: File Under Pop) was released on Yep Roc Records on 5 March 2013. The label also released his subsequent record, The Man Upstairs, on 26 August 2014. April 2015 saw Robyn Hitchcock team up with Emma Swift to release a limited Record Store Day 7\\" single \\"Follow Your Money,\\" backed with a stripped back cover of Neil Young's \\"Moving Pictures.\\" The pair subsequently toured, releasing another 7\\" single double A side with the songs \\"Love Is A Drag\\" and \\"Life Is Change,\\" produced by Teenage Fanclub's Norman Blake. In 2017, Hitchcock released his eponymous album Robyn Hitchcock. Working with Brendan Benson as co-producer, the album saw a return to a full band sound after his previous release, with guest appearances from Gillian Welch and Emma Swift. Hitchcock wrote the song \\"Sunday Never Comes\\" for the 2018 film Juliet, Naked, which was sung in the movie by Ethan Hawke's character, an aging, reclusive musician. He later released a companion video of his own version of the song. In September 2019 Hitchcock collaborated with XTC frontman Andy Partridge on a four-song EP Planet England, co-writing the songs and both singing. In 2020, he released The Man Downstairs: Demos & Rarities, an album of outtakes recorded in 2013 as demos for The Man Upstairs. He also appeared on Emma Swift's album of Bob Dylan covers, Blonde on the Tracks, recorded between 2017 and 2020 in Nashville, Tennessee and produced by Wilco's Pat Sansone. Personal life Hitchcock was born in Paddington, London, England, son of novelist Raymond Hitchcock (writer of Percy).Harris, W. \\"A chat with Robyn Hitchcock,\\" Bullz- eye.com, 10 February 2006. Retrieved 9 February 2013. Hitchcock writes short stories, paints (often in a whimsical, surrealist style), and draws in a cartoon-strip style. His album covers often make use of his paintings or drawings, and the liner notes sometimes include a short story. His live concerts include story-telling, in the form of imaginative and surreal ad- libbed monologues in his lyrical style. Hitchcock collaborated with director Jonathan Demme in 1998 for a live concert and film Storefront Hitchcock, and later appeared in Demme's 2004 remake of The Manchurian Candidate, in which he played double agent Laurent Tokar. He also appeared in Demme's Rachel Getting Married in 2008, singing and playing guitar in the wedding-party band. In September 2008 Hitchcock joined the Disko Bay Cape Farewell expedition to the West Coast of Greenland. Cape Farewell is a UK-based arts organisation that brings artists, scientists and communicators together to instigate a cultural response to climate change. Other voyagers on the trip included musicians Feist, Laurie Anderson, Jarvis Cocker, KT Tunstall and Martha Wainwright. In August 2015, Hitchcock moved to Nashville, Tennessee, with his partner, Emma Swift.

Godfrey played college football at the University of Georgia, where he majored in housing and consumer economics. He also played High School Football at Lowndes High School in Valdosta Georgia. He was drafted in the 1996 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys with the 49th overall pick. He then played for the Tennessee Titans and the Seattle Seahawks. Early years Godfrey attended Lowndes High School where he was a three-sport athlete (football, basketball and track). As a senior, he finished with 111 tackles, 6 sacks and 2 interceptions, receiving All-American, All- State and All-South honors. He accepted a scholarship from the University of Georgia, becoming the first true freshman in school history to lead the team in tackles (114) and was also named SEC Freshman of the Year. The next year, he repeated as the team leader in tackles (114) and earned All-SEC honors. As a junior, he registered 102 tackles (second on the team), 2 sacks and 5 passes defensed. In his last year he missed four games with a pulled hamstring, affecting his playing time and finishing with 35 tackles (3 for loss). Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Godfrey was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round of the 1996 NFL Draft, after dropping because of his diminished production as a college senior. Although he was drafted to play middle linebacker, the level of skill and speed he demonstrated in training camp, allowed the Cowboys to move him into different defensive positions. He started the last six games of his rookie season at strongside linebacker replacing Broderick Thomas. The next year, he registered 149 tackles (second on the team), one sack and 2 passes defensed. In 1998, he finished with 115 tackles (fourth on the team), 3 sacks and 3 forced fumbles. In 1999, he led the team with 143 tackles after being switched to his natural position at middle linebacker, replacing Fred Strickland who was released. In the 90's, the Cowboys organization felt they could find linebackers through the draft, without the need of paying a premium and adversely impacting the salary cap, so they allowed talented and productive players like Ken Norton Jr., Darrin Smith, Dixon Edwards and Robert Jones, to leave via free agency, instead of signing them into long-term contracts. During the 2000 free agency period, although Godfrey was firmly entrenched as the team starting middle linebacker, the Cowboys chose not to match the offer he received from the Tennessee Titans and decided to let Dat Nguyen take over the position. He never missed a game in his four seasons in Dallas, recording 438 tackles, 5 quarterback sacks and 2 interceptions. =Tennessee Titans= In 2000, he set a career-high with 169 tackles and was named second-team All-Pro. He also registered 3 sacks, 6 passes defensed, 2 fumble recoveries and 2 interceptions. Godfrey led the Titans in tackles each of his first two seasons with the team. Because of a right ankle injury he suffered in the season opener, he only played in 8 games (5 starts) during the 2002 season, finishing with 44 tackles and a sack. Even though the Titans reworked his contract, with him agreeing to take less money, the team released him for salary cap reasons at the start of training camp in 2003. =Seattle Seahawks= Godfrey signed a one-year contract with the Seattle Seahawks, where he started 14 games and had 59 tackles in 2003. =San Diego Chargers= The San Diego Chargers signed Godfrey to a three-year deal in 2004. He was released after the 2007 NFL Draft. =Washington Redskins= On August 21, 2007, Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs, seeking to rebuild an injury-riddled linebacking corps, talked Godfrey out of retirement. He was not re-signed after the season and retired. On October 28, 2007, Godfrey made critical remarks regarding New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. Following a game in which the Patriots defeated the Redskins 52-7, Godfrey accused Belichick of showing the Redskins \\"no respect\\" because the Patriots continued to call deep passing plays despite leading 38-0 entering the fourth quarter. Belichick defended his play calling, saying \\"When you're playing defense it's your job to stop them. It's not (the offense's) job to not score.\\"  References  American football linebackers Dallas Cowboys players Tennessee Titans players Seattle Seahawks players San Diego Chargers players Washington Redskins players Georgia Bulldogs football players People from Valdosta, Georgia Players of American football from Georgia (U.S. state) 1973 births Living people ","title":"Randall Godfrey"},{"id":"982697","text":"Seven ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS Archer, named after a person proficient in archery - an archer: * was a 12-gun gun-brig launched in 1801 and sold in 1815. * was a wood screw sloop launched in 1849 and broken up in 1866. * was a torpedo cruiser launched in 1885 and sold in 1905. * was an launched in 1911 and sold in 1921. * was a launched in 1939 and transferred to the Royal Navy on Lend-lease in 1941.

She was built as the cargo ship Mormacland, but was converted to an escort carrier and renamed HMS Archer. Her transmission was a constant cause of problems which led to her being withdrawn from front-line service. She was used as a stores ship and then as an accommodation ship before a refit and subsequent use as a merchant aircraft ferry ship, Empire Lagan. She was returned to the US Navy, then laid up as Archer before being sold into merchant service and converted to a passenger ship, Anna Sal√©n. She was used to take emigrants to Australia and Canada in the early 1950s. She was sold and renamed Tasmania and after further service as an emigrant ship was converted back to a cargo ship. She was later sold and renamed Union Reliance. She was scrapped after a collision and fire in 1961. Design and description Mormacland was laid down as a type C3 cargo ship on 1 August 1939, under United States Maritime Commission contract (MC Hull 46), by the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Chester, Pennsylvania, as Yard number 184. She was launched on 14 December 1939 and completed on 24 April 1940. HMS Archer was the only Long Island class escort carrier in service with the Royal Navy during the Second World War. She was converted from the American merchant ship Mormacland which was built at the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. She was laid down on 1 August 1939, launched on 14 December 1939 and delivered on 24 April 1940.Cocker (2008), p.78. She was converted to an escort aircraft carrier in the Atlantic Basin Iron Works at Brooklyn New York and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 6 May 1942, under the command of Captain Conolly Abel Smith.Poolman (1972), p.51. Archer had a complement of 555 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a height of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. Propulsion was provided by four diesel engines connected to one shaft giving 8,500 brake horsepower (BHP), which could propel the ship at .Cocker (2008), p.79. Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge‚Äìflight control on the starboard side and above the long wooden flight deck, one aircraft lift by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by half hangar below the flight deck.Poolman (1972), p.29. Armament comprised three single mounted 4 inch dual purpose anti-aircraft guns and fifteen 20 mm cannons on single or twin mounts. She had the capacity for fifteen aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft. Service history Mormacland was . She was operated by Moore-McCormack Lines Inc., with New York as her homeport, until 6 March 1941 when she was requisitioned by the United States Navy and sent to Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Co, Newport News, Virginia, for conversion to an aircraft carrier. =BAVG 1= When requisitioned by the US Navy,' Mormacland was designated BAVG-1, the first hull of the series intended for delivery to the Royal Navy. The conversion consisted of a lightweight wooden flight deck on a truss frame being added on top of the ship which covered about 70% of the ship's length. The deck was serviced by a single lift aft where the aircraft hangar was situated. The conversion was completed on 15 November 1941. As converted, she was transferred to the Royal Navy. Archer was a sister of the . Like the Long Island, the Archer had no island structure. Her original bridge was retained and extended at the sides to provide visibility. Her funnel was replaced by twin diesel vents to either side of the flight deck. Her Busch-Sulzer engines sometimes produced so much black smoke that landing aircraft couldn't see the batman or flight deck. =HMS Archer= Two days after the conversion was completed, BAVG-1 was transferred to and commissioned in the Royal Navy as part of the Lend-Lease program. On 23 December 1941, three US Navy Grumman F4F Wildcats landed on Archer for trials to the launch accelerator. The accelerator misfired, causing the first aircraft to dive into the sea as sufficient airspeed had not been gained. The remaining two aircraft were successfully flown off. Archer put into the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 24 December 1941 for repairs to the accelerator, which had been damaged in the misfire. On 2 January 1942, Archer successfully completed her sea trials. On 9 January, she sailed down the Delaware River bound for Norfolk, Virginia, where she was to load aircraft for ferrying to the United Kingdom. Her gyro compass failed near Goose Island and then her engines developed problems. After repairs were effected she arrived at Norfolk and on 12 January she embarked eleven Martlet Is. She departed Norfolk on 13 January but was soon in trouble, as her steering developed a fault and her gyro compass failed. Repairs were made and she set course for Kingston, Jamaica. Later that day, Archer had a collision with the American owned, Peruvian flagged SS Brazos some east of Charleston, South Carolina (). Archer sustained damage to her bow, and eventually settled down at the bow by 5 degrees after the damage and flooding had been contained. Both ships were dead in the water. The 35 crewmembers of Brazos transferred to Archer in their own lifeboats and Brazos sank on 14 January. Archers captain had radioed for assistance and at first light started to make for the coast, but as her propeller was half out of the water, progress was minimal. On 16 January, Archer rendezvoused with US Coastguard tug Tallapoosa which unsuccessfully attempted to tow Archer. It was decided that Archer should continue under her own power until a more powerful tug could assist her. On 17 January, reached her and proceeded to tow her to Charleston, where she arrived on 21 January. She entered dry dock on 28 January for repairs, which took about six weeks. On 7 March 1942, Archer embarked twelve Martlets for delivery to and her own four Fairey Swordfish aircraft of 834 Squadron which had flown out from Jamaica. She sailed on 18 March for San Juan, Puerto Rico, in company with and two destroyers as part of Convoy AS 2. On 22 March Archer again had problems with her steering gear. She put into San Juan on 23 March and rejoined the convoy on 24 March. Anti- submarine patrols were carried out without a sighting, although one Swordfish was badly damaged on 30 March when it lost its tailhook and ended up in the safety barrier. Although her engines and gyro compass continued to give trouble, she arrived at Freetown. Sierra Leone on 3 April. On 9 April, Archers twelve brand new Martlets were transferred to Illustrious and two Martlets from Illustrious were transferred to Archer. On 15 June 1942, one of her Swordfish aircraft became the first ever aircraft to land on Ascension Island. The aircraft's crew were looking for survivors from SS Lyle Park which had been sunk by U-752. They landed to pass on a message destined for the Admiralty. Archers powerplant continued to give trouble, particularly the electro-magnetic clutches. If the clutch disengaged the engines would race at high revs and had to be shut down in order for repairs to be made. This was particularly problematic if aircraft were flying or there were enemy submarines nearby. On 26 June, Archer departed Freetown bound for Bermuda, where she was to undergo repairs. Work started on 15 July and took some fourteen weeks to complete. Archer then sailed to New York City where she joined Convoy UGS 2 which departed New York on 2 November bound for Casablanca, Morocco. She ferried 30 Curtiss P-40 Warhawks and US personnel to Casablanca. She then sailed to Gibraltar to join convoy MKF 3 which departed Gibraltar on 27 November. When Archer arrived in the UK, she was sent to Liverpool for another refit which commenced on 4 December. Her flight deck was lengthened at this refit. King George VI on the bridge, on his left is the Captain of HMS Archer and Admiral Commanding Aircraft Carriers, Admiral Lyster. On 19 February 1943, Archer embarked nine Martlet Vs of 892 Squadron and on 28 February embarked nine Swordfish Mk II aircraft of 819 Squadron. She was inspected by the King the following day and then sent to shipyards on the Clyde and at Belfast for further rectification work. In early May, Archer joined the 4th Escort Group off Iceland on convoy support operations. She joined Convoy ONS 6 on 9 May and then Convoy ON 182 on 12 May, leaving these convoys on 14 May. On 21 May she joined Convoy HX 239. On 23 May, a Swordfish II of 819 Squadron sank U-752 with a Rocket Spear, a new weapon, at . The thirteen survivors were rescued by . U-752 was the first German U-boat to be sunk with rockets and only the second to be sunk by aircraft that operated from an escort aircraft carrier. Archer left Convoy HX 239 on 24 May. She then joined Convoy KMS 18B on 26 June and left that convoy on 3 July. She was then withdrawn from the 4th Escort Group to take part in exercises in the Irish Sea. Following these exercises, she was sent to the Bay of Biscay on anti- submarine patrol duty, but was withdrawn from this after a week due to a lack of U-boat activity and further defects. She arrived at Devonport on 27 July and work commenced the following day. Archer then sailed to the Clyde for engine repairs, arriving on 3 August. It was found that Archer had extensive defects and she was decommissioned with effect from 6 November 1943. She was relegated to use as a stores ship at Gare Loch. In March 1944, Archer was towed to Loch Alsh where she was used as an accommodation ship until August when she was sent to Belfast for repairs to enable her to be used as an aircraft ferry ship. Repairs were to take seven and a half months. Archer was the first of thirty-eight US-built converted C3 Escort Carriers turned over to Great Britain during the period 1941‚Äì1944, and one of five motor ships (the remainder were powered by geared turbines). Unlike the others, Archer was powered by four diesel engines instead of two. =Empire Lagan= On completion of the repairs on 15 March 1945, HMS Archer was transferred to the Ministry of War Transport and renamed Empire Lagan. She was used to ferry aircraft to the United Kingdom. Converted to a cargo ship,Plowman, Peter (2006): Australian Migrant Ships 1946‚Äì1977. Rosenberg Publishing Pty Ltd. Pp 58‚Äì59. she operated under the management of the Blue Funnel Line and later A Holt & Co. Empire Lagan was homeported in London. Empire Lagan returned to the US in Convoy UC 69, which departed Liverpool on 24 May 1945 and arrived at New York on 3 June 1945. She then sailed to Norfolk, Virginia. =Archer= On 9 January 1946, Empire Lagan was returned to the US Navy and renamed USS Archer. She was stricken from the US Navy register on 26 February 1946. MV Archer was laid up at Norfolk, Virginia. On 30 September 1947 she was sold to Mr J F Luley, New York for commercial service. =Anna Sal√©n= Anna Salen in 1950.

Photograph from Australian National Maritime Museum In 1948 Archer was bought by Swedish businessman Sven Sal√©n, and registered under the ownership of Rederi Pulp AB; her homeport was Stockholm. She was renamed Anna Sal√©n and, after initial conversion into a bulk carrier at the Bethlehem Shipyard in Baltimore, took a load of coal from the US to Italy. By this time the owners had obtained a contract from the International Refugee Organisation to transport Displaced Persons from Europe to Australia and Canada. After arrival in Italy, Anna Sal√©n was then converted to a passenger ship, with basic accommodation being built into the cargo holds and the superstructure being extended from the foc's'le to the stern. There was accommodation for 1500 passengers in a single class. After the rebuild she was . Her maiden voyage as a passenger ship (22 May‚Äî21 June 1949) was from Naples, Italy, to Melbourne and Sydney.

After repairs were completed, Anna Sal√©n resumed service. Her next two voyages, beginning on 20 June and 27 November 1950, departed from Bremerhaven bound for Australia. During the latter journey, one of the emigrants, Herr Gustav Kovaks, made a film about the voyage. It was later widely shown in Germany to give people a view of how the emigration process worked. Anna Sal√©n arrived at Fremantle on 31 December 1950 and sailed for Melbourne later that day. It was realised that she couldn't make Melbourne before the New Year, so for political reasons Anna Sal√©n was ordered back to Fremantle where all 1,522 passengers were disembarked. She departed Bremen, West Germany on 2 July 1953 to make a round trip to Quebec, Canada The journey took seven days. In the early to mid-1950s, Anna Sal√©n was used between Europe, Saigon and Australia. On 26 December 1951, Anna Sal√©n came across the Canadian coaster SS Mayfall flying a distress signal. She had encountered bad weather and run out of fuel. Anna Sal√©n towed Mayfall to St Johns and then continued her journey to Halifax On 13 August 1952, Anna Sal√©n collided with the Norwegian whaler SS Thorshovdi in the Pentland Firth. She put into Lyness with damage to her bows. She was sold in 1955 to a Greek buyer. =Tasmania= Anna Sal√©n was bought by Compagnia Navigazione Tasmania SA, Piraeus and renamed Tasmania. She was placed under the management of Hellenic Mediterranean Lines and used on routes between French ports and Australia. and also on the Piraeus ‚Äì Melbourne route of Hellenic Mediterranean Lines. In 1958, she was converted to a cargo ship of . She was sold to a Taiwanese buyer in 1961. =Union Reliance= Tasmania was bought by the China Union Lines of Taipei. She was renamed Union Reliance. She was used on routes between Taipei and the USA. On 7 November 1961, she collided with the Norwegian tanker MV Berea in the Houston Ship Channel. As a result of the collision, Union Reliance caught fire and then ran aground. Twelve people aboard the Union Reliance were killed in the collision and subsequent fire. Union Reliance was abandoned by her owners. The wreck was removed on 9 November by the United States authorities and towed to Galveston, Texas China Union Lines refused to make payment for this, and filed a Petition for Exoneration from, or Limitation of Liability. The Court ordered that Union Reliance and her cargo be sold to pay off costs incurred by the United States authorities. On 12 January 1962, Union Reliance was sold for US$109,100 for scrap. She was scrapped at New Orleans in March 1962. Propulsion She was powered by four 7 cylinder Single Cycle Single Action diesel engines. These drove a single screw via electro-magnetic slip couplings and single reduction gearing. The engines were built by Busch-Sulzer Brothers Diesel Engine Co, St Louis, Missouri. The engines were 20¬Ω inches bore by 27 inches stroke (520 mm by 690 mm). They developed a total of 2,060 nominal horse power each. As HMS Archer, she had a range of at .

Ev. Bernardsky (1819‚Äì1889); Col. Woodcut The observatory was opened in 1839. Originally, it was a brainchild of the German/Russian astronomer Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve, who would become its first director (in 1861, his son Otto Wilhelm von Struve succeeded him). The architect was Alexander Bryullov. The observatory was equipped with state- of-the-art devices, one of them being the a aperture refractor, one of the largest refractors in the world at that time (see Great Refractor). In 1885, the observatory was equipped with refractor, which was the biggest usable refractor in the world, until the telescope at the Lick Observatory in California a few years later. Both were built by Alvan Clark & Sons in Massachusetts.Pulkovo Observatory web page (in Russian) The principal line of work of the observatory consisted of determination of coordinates of stars and astronomical constants, such as precession, nutation, aberration and refraction, and also discovering and measuring double stars. The observatory's activities have also been connected to the geographical study of the territory of Russia and development of navigation. The star catalogues, containing the most precise positions of 374, and then 558 stars, were made for the years 1845, 1865, 1885, 1905 and 1930. Staff of the Pulkovo Observatory (1883‚Äì1886) By the 50th anniversary of the Observatory, they had built an astrophysical laboratory with a mechanical workshop and installed the Europe's largest refractor, (30 inch). Astrophysical research really gained momentum with the appointment of Feodor Bredikhin as a director of the Observatory in 1890 and transfer of Aristarkh Belopolsky from the Moscow Observatory, an expert in stellar spectroscopy and solar research. In 1923, they installed a big Littrow spectrograph, and in 1940 ‚Äì a horizontal solar telescope, manufactured at a Leningrad factory. After having received an astrograph in 1894, the observatory began its work on astrophotography. In 1927, the Observatory received a zone astrograph and with its help the Russian astronomers catalogued the stars of the near-polar areas of the sky. Regular observation of movements of celestial poles began with the construction of the zenith telescope in 1904. In 1920, the Observatory started transmitting the exact time by radio signals. The observatory participated in the basic geodesic work, namely in measuring degrees of the arc of the meridian from the Danube to the Arctic Ocean (until 1851), and in triangulation of Spitsbergen in 1899‚Äì1901. Military geodesists and hydrographers used to work at the Observatory as interns. The Pulkovo Meridian, which passes through the center of the main building of the Observatory and is located at 30¬∞19,6‚Äò east of Greenwich, was the point of departure for all former geographical maps of Russia.John Lankford History of astronomy: an encyclopedia pp.423‚Äì424, Taylor & Francis, 1997 In order to observe the southern stars that could not be seen on the observatory's latitude, the scientists organized two affiliated observing locations. One of them was an astrophysical station in the Crimean town of Simeiz (Simeiz Observatory), which had been organized on the basis of a private observatory presented to the Pulkovo Observatory by an astronomy lover N. S. Maltsev in 1908. The other was an astrometric station in Nikolaev ‚Äì a former observatory of the Department of the Navy, (today's Nikolaev Astronomical Observatory).  Later history  During the siege of Leningrad (1941‚Äì1944), the Observatory became the target of fierce German air raids and artillery bombardment. All of the buildings were completely destroyed. Under dramatic circumstances, the main instruments were saved and stored safely in Leningrad, including the lens of the destroyed 30-inch refractor, and a significant part of the unique library with manuscripts and important works from the 15th to 19th century. On February 5, 1997, nearly 1,500 of the 3,852 books were destroyed by malicious arson and the rest of the library items were damaged by flames, smoke or water.Andr√© Heck Information handling in astronomy: historical vistas p. 147, Springer, 2003 The 65 cm Zeiss (25.59 inches) achromatic refractor of Pulkovo observatory Even before the end of the war, the Soviet government made a decision to restore the Observatory. In 1946, it began the construction after having cleared the territory. In May 1954, the Observatory was re-opened, not only having been restored but considerably expanded in terms of instruments, employees and research subjects. New departments had been created, such as the Department of Radio Astronomy and Department of Instrument Making (with its own optical and mechanical workshop). The surviving old instruments were repaired, modernized and put into service once again. Also installed were new instruments, such as the refractor, a horizontal meridian device, a photographic polar telescope, a big zenith telescope, stellar interferometer, 2 solar telescopes, coronagraph, a big radio telescope and all kinds of labware. The 65 cm Zeiss refractor was originally intended as a gift from then Chancellor of Germany Adolf Hitler to the Italian Benito Mussolini, but it was not delivered and instead was recovered by the Soviet Union.Journal for the history of astronomy vol. 28, pt. 2, p. 177 (1997), Title: Book Review: Pulkovo / St. Petersburg : Spuren der Sterne und der Zeiten : Geschichte der russischen Hauptsternwarte / Peter Lang, New York, 1995, Bibliographic Code: 1997JHA....28..177H The Simeiz station became a part of the new Crimean Astrophysical Observatory of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1945. They also built the Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station and a laboratory in Blagoveshchensk. The observatory organized many expeditions for determining differences of longitudes, observing passages of Venus and solar eclipses, and studying astroclimate. In 1962, the Observatory sent an expedition to Chile to observe stars in the southern skies.Frank Kelly Edmondson AURA and its US national observatories pp. 199 ff Cambridge University Press, 1997  Gallery  File:1989 CPA 6095.jpg|Soviet post stamp on occasion of 150th anniversary of the observatory File:Pulkovo 30 inch refracting telescope.jpg|The 30 inch (76 cm) refractor, installed in 1885, was one of the largest telescopes in the world at that time  Directors   See also  * List of Russian astronomers and astrophysicists  References   External links  * History of the observatory (in Russian) * The official site of Pulkovo observatory * Overview of the observatory * 1839 establishments in the Russian Empire Astronomical observatories built in the Soviet Union Astronomical observatories in Russia Buildings and structures completed in 1839 Institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences Science museums in Saint Petersburg World Heritage Sites in Russia ","title":"Pulkovo Observatory"},{"id":"982723","text":"right Global Unions or Council of Global Unions is a website, which is jointly owned and managed by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD, and ten global union federations (GUFs). The Council of Global Unions (CGU) held its inaugural meeting in Brussels, 9‚Äì10 January 2007. All GUFs, with the exception of the International Metalworkers' Federation, as well as TUAC, became members of the Council and signed the agreement. The CGU was created to encourage closer co-operation among global unions in order to act more effectively at the international level to build a more favourable, enabling environment for organising and collective bargaining. Although its work has policy implications, it was not established to make policy. That is the responsibility of the organisations that constitute the CGU. The Global Unions group is made up of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), which has 175 million members in 151 countries; the global union federations, which represent their respective sectors at the international trade union level (BWI, EI, IAEA, ICEM, IFJ, IMF, ITF, ITGLWF, IUF, PSI and UNI); and the Trade Union Advisory Committee (TUAC) to the OECD. In November 2006 two international union organizations were created, the ITUC and the Council of Global Unions that emerged from a reorganization of the international trade union movement (which was divided because of post-war divisions). ITUC is the result of the breakup of both the WCL and ICFTU for the purposes of uniting under one organisation. The Council of Global Unions was created at the first meeting of ITUC and is a body involving the GUFs, ITUC, and TUAC. Although Global Unions are described as 'global', this represents more an \\"aspiration than a reality since they are more accurately described as international bodies with wide coverage that are 'globalising (Croucher and Cotton, 2009). Historically, they have built outwards from their European bases in an attempt to include unions in other regions and are still trying to extend their coverage to every country where unions are found. According to Harold Lewis (2003) the Global Union Federations are responsible for 80 per cent of the international movement‚Äôs activity and 90 per cent of its work directly affecting workplaces.

Sam was played by Robert Kelker-Kelly, Danny Markel, and Brian Lane Green. Amanda was played by Sandra Ferguson, Christine Tucci, and Laura Moss. The couple were a popular super couple for fans during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Their love affair lasted from 1987, shortly after their first meeting, until 1990. They remarried in 1991 and the second try lasted until early 1993 when it ended in divorce. History Amanda Cory is the only biological child of wealthy publisher Mac (Douglass Watson) and Rachel Cory (Victoria Wyndham). She had a rocky childhood with her parents constantly splitting up, among other events. She still led a life of privilege and enjoyed a close bond with her family. In 1987, Amanda returned to Bay City from Paris, where she was attending school. At the same time, a man named Sam Fowler came to town. He was there to find his half-brother, Mitch Blake (William Gray Espy), who was also the biological father of Amanda's brother, Matthew. Sam was a budding artist and needed a place to stay. When Amanda returned to town, she was informed by her brother that their parents were throwing a cotillion for her. She was angry as she did not want to have people perceive her as spoiled, rich, or glamorous. When Amanda told Rachel that she didn't want the party (mere hours before it was to be held), Rachel was crushed because all she wanted was to give Amanda the perks that she was denied when she grew up poor. Rachel's mother Ada (Constance Ford) understood Rachel's sadness but she implored her to understand her daughter's right to have a say on events that impacted her life. Amanda did not want to hurt her mother, however, and showed up at the cotillion on time, in full debutante regalia. Mitch had the idea to have Sam work as a valet at Amanda's party to earn some money. Mitch had to promise his fianc√©e Felicia Gallant (Linda Dano) that Mac was not to know that Sam was related to him, due to previous issues between the Cory family and him. When Amanda first showed up at the Cory mansion, Sam mistook Amanda for another valet, and was fairly bossy toward her. Amanda just wanted to be treated like any other person, so she did not tell him who her parents were, and since he did not see her at the debutante ball, he remained blissfully unaware. She made up this persona called \\"Mandy Ashton\\" and started working on Brava Magazine at Cory Publishing, her father's company. She made her father promise not to tell anyone who she was, and that he could only talk about it to people who knew (such as her mother, and her best friend Julie Ann). He agreed, under the guise that she did not want to be treated differently due to who her parents were. Mac also hired Sam as a cover art designer, with Felicia pulling some strings with Rachel to get him the job. \\"Mandy\\" buddied up to Sam and eventually started working as his assistant. Over time, they fell in love. Sam's friend Joyce came to break them up but was unsuccessful. Eventually, however, Sam found out, fired \\"Mandy\\", and became very resentful toward Amanda; this stemmed from Sam's long animosity against anyone who had money. After Amanda pleaded with him that she was still the same person he fell in love with, he took her back. Amanda lost her virginity to Sam and later found out that she was pregnant with his child. At first she did not tell him, as she found out when they were estranged, but she eventually told him the truth when they reconciled. While he had mixed feelings, he realized that he was going to love this baby with all of his heart. Mac Cory, who did not know that Sam was related to Mitch, was finally let in on the information. Liz Matthews (Irene Dailey), who had come back to town and resumed secretarial duties for Mac, found Sam's file and told Mac that his next of kin was Mitch and that they were brothers. Mac saw red and wanted to fire Sam, and was very disillusioned that his wife would also lie about the situation (she had been sworn to secrecy by Felicia, and understood that she would be more accepting of Sam than Mac would). After a while, however, Mac's emotions cooled and he grew to accept Sam, or as much as Mac knew how. With everyone in the know, Sam and Amanda got engaged and planned a wedding. Sam and Mitch's mother Loretta (Rosemary Murphy) came to town, and her big secret was revealed fairly early: she was a kleptomaniac. When Loretta stole a wedding present to give to Amanda, Sam confronted her on his wedding day and ordered her to take it back. When Loretta denied that she ever stole anything, Sam yelled at her and said he was fed up with having such a horrible mother. Shocked, Loretta slapped him and walked out. Sam took matters into his own hands and went to Chicago, where his mother stole the present, with the intent of returning it. When he got there, however, he was accused of thieving the item. Sam, pushed over the edge, punched the security guard and was arrested. Amanda did not know what was going on and waited for Sam at the chapel. She was heartbroken when he didn't show up, but believed, deep down in her heart, that he would not do this to her without a good reason. Mac told everyone that he knew that Sam would break her heart the whole time, because he was related to Mitch. Squabbling ensued, with Ada finally ordering everyone to be quiet. Loretta admitted that they had a fight, and told the Corys what it involved. Sam was freed from the jail and raced back to town, only to find that he was too late. He drove up to the Cory mansion and spied on the squabbling guests, finally deciding on climbing up to Amanda's window. She started to yell at him for missing their important day, but as soon as he explained, Amanda hugged him and knew their love was real. They decided to go back to the church and the two held a late-night wedding. They wed shortly before Amanda gave birth to her only child, Alexandra \\"Alli\\" Fowler (named after Mac's mother). Amanda, who was always very close to her father, was devastated when he died of a heart attack. Their marriage fell apart when Sam found out she was sleeping with Evan Frame (Charles Grant), but the two got back together again for a short time, until Sam left Amanda to focus on his music career. Amanda began writing a biography on Senator Grant Harrison (Mark Pinter), and after his marriage to Vicky Hudson (Jensen Buchanan) fell apart, the two of them began a romantic relationship. Then Evan Frame came back to town. He tried to start up a relationship, but Amanda wasn't interested in cheating on her fiance. When Amanda and Evan were in a car accident together, Grant assumed she'd been unfaithful, but married her while she was still recovering. She spent months in a wheelchair with Grant calling all the shots, but as soon as she could walk again and realized what a skunk her husband was, she divorced him. When his mother showed up in town pretending to be Rachel, Amanda left, feeling like her mother didn't want her around. Amanda returned a few months later, determined to break her mother and Carl up. She pretended to be a woman named \\"Hadley Prescott\\", who was having an affair with Amanda. Eventually she was found out, but not before developing feelings for IAD officer Neil Johansen, co-owner of the Herald Jake McKinnon (Matt had given Amanda his half), and carpenter-turned-doctor Shane Roberts. After Carl was presumed dead, Amanda put her anger with Carl behind her to support her mother. Amanda began a romantic relationship with Frank Cameron, a convict- turned-FBI-agent who was sent to infiltrate the Cory household. Despite misgivings about his past, Amanda fell in love with Cameron, who she discovered was really Cameron Sinclair, and the two began to plan their future together, until Amanda discovered that while she and Gary were fighting for their lives, Cameron and Josie were making love on the beach. She was able to forgive him for the affair, and the two began planning for their wedding. On the day of the ceremony, Amanda learned that Josie was pregnant with Cameron's baby, and he'd been lying to her all along. She called off the ceremony, then spent a time being stalked by Jordan Stark, who knew that Amanda was the reincarnation of his dead wife, Amalie Kittridge. Cameron was instrumental in saving her, and the two ended up getting married after all.

More precisely, let be a group, and let and be subgroups. Let act on by left multiplication while acts on by right multiplication.

Equivalently, is the equivalence class of under the equivalence relation : if and only if there exist in and in such that . The set of all double cosets is denoted :H \\\\backslash G / K.  Properties  Suppose that is a group with subgroups and acting by left and right multiplication, respectively. The -double cosets of may be equivalently described as orbits for the product group acting on by . Many of the basic properties of double cosets follow immediately from the fact that they are orbits. However, because is a group and and are subgroups acting by multiplication, double cosets are more structured than orbits of arbitrary group actions, and they have additional properties that are false for more general actions. * Two double cosets and are either disjoint or identical. * is the disjoint union of its double cosets. * There is a one-to-one correspondence between the two double coset spaces and given by identifying with . * If , then .

It follows that . Similarly, if is normal, then . * If is a normal subgroup of , then the -double cosets are in one-to-one correspondence with the left (and right) -cosets. * Consider as the union of a -orbit of right -cosets.

The double stabilizer therefore has the descriptions *:(H \\\\times K)_x = \\\\\\\\{(h, x^{-1}h^{-1}x) \\\\colon h \\\\in H\\\\\\\\} \\\\cap H \\\\times K = \\\\\\\\{(xk^{-1}x^{-1}, k) \\\\colon k \\\\in K\\\\\\\\} \\\\cap H \\\\times K. * (Orbit‚Äìstabilizer theorem) There is a bijection between and under which corresponds to .

There is an equivalent description of double cosets in terms of single cosets. Let and both act by right multiplication on . Then acts by left multiplication on the product of coset spaces . The orbits of this action are in one-to-one correspondence with . This correspondence identifies with the double coset . Briefly, this is because every -orbit admits representatives of the form , and the representative is determined only up to left multiplication by an element of . Similarly, acts by right multiplication on , and the orbits of this action are in one-to-one correspondence with the double cosets . Conceptually, this identifies the double coset space with the space of relative configurations of an -coset and a -coset. Additionally, this construction generalizes to the case of any number of subgroups. Given subgroups , the space of -multicosets is the set of -orbits of . The analog of Lagrange's theorem for double cosets is false. This means that the size of a double coset need not divide the order of . For example, let be the symmetric group on three letters, and let and be the cyclic subgroups generated by the transpositions and , respectively. If denotes the identity permutation, then :HeK = HK = \\\\\\\\{ e, (1 2), (1 3), (1 3 2) \\\\\\\\}. This has four elements, and four does not divide six, the order of . It is also false that different double cosets have the same size. Continuing the same example, :H(2 3)K = \\\\\\\\{ (2 3), (1 2 3) \\\\\\\\}, which has two elements, not four. However, suppose that is normal. As noted earlier, in this case the double coset space equals the right coset space . Similarly, if is normal, then is the left coset space . Standard results about left and right coset spaces then imply the following facts. * for all . That is, all double cosets have the same cardinality. * If is finite, then . In particular, and divide .  Examples  * Let be the symmetric group, considered as permutations of the set }. Consider the subgroup which stabilizes . Then consists of two double cosets. One of these is . If is a permutation which does not fix , then the other coset is represented by . * Let be the group , and let be the subgroup of upper triangular matrices. The double coset space is the Bruhat decomposition of . Each double coset has a representative , where is a permutation matrix. For instance, if , then *:B \\\\backslash \\\\operatorname{GL}_2(\\\\mathbf{R}) / B = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ B\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}B, B\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}B \\\\right\\\\\\\\}.  Products in the free abelian group on the set of double cosets  Suppose that is a group and that , , and are subgroups. Under certain finiteness conditions, there is a product on the free abelian group generated by the - and -double cosets with values in the free abelian group generated by the -double cosets. This means there is a bilinear function :\\\\mathbf{Z}[H \\\\backslash G / K] \\\\times \\\\mathbf{Z}[K \\\\backslash G / L] \\\\to \\\\mathbf{Z}[H \\\\backslash G / L]. Assume for simplicity that is finite. To define the product, reinterpret these free abelian groups in terms of the group algebra of as follows. Every element of has the form :\\\\sum_{HxK \\\\in H \\\\backslash G / K} f_{HxK} \\\\cdot [HxK], where is a set of integers indexed by the elements of . This element may be interpreted as a -valued function on , specifically, . This function may be pulled back along the projection which sends to the double coset . This results in a function . By the way in which this function was constructed, it is left invariant under and right invariant under . The corresponding element of the group algebra is :\\\\sum_{x \\\\in G} f_{HxK} \\\\cdot [x], and this element is invariant under left multiplication by and right multiplication by . Conceptually, this element is obtained by replacing by the elements it contains, and the finiteness of ensures that the sum is still finite. Conversely, every element of which is left invariant under and right invariant under is the pullback of a function on . Parallel statements are true for and . When elements of , , and are interpreted as invariant elements of , then the product whose existence was asserted above is precisely the multiplication in . Indeed, it is trivial to check that the product of a left--invariant element and a right--invariant element continues to be left--invariant and right--invariant. The bilinearity of the product follows immediately from the bilinearity of multiplication in . It also follows that if is a fourth subgroup of , then the product of -, -, and -double cosets is associative. Because the product in corresponds to convolution of functions on , this product is sometimes called the convolution product. An important special case is when . In this case, the product is a bilinear function :\\\\mathbf{Z}[H \\\\backslash G / H] \\\\times \\\\mathbf{Z}[H \\\\backslash G / H] \\\\to \\\\mathbf{Z}[H \\\\backslash G / H]. This product turns into an associative ring whose identity element is the class of the trivial double coset . In general, this ring is non-commutative. For example, if , then the ring is the group algebra , and a group algebra is a commutative ring if and only if the underlying group is abelian. If is normal, so that the -double cosets are the same as the elements of the quotient group , then the product on is the product in the group algebra . In particular, it is the usual convolution of functions on . In this case, the ring is commutative if and only if is abelian, or equivalently, if and only if contains the commutator subgroup of . If is not normal, then may be commutative even if is non- abelian. A classical example is the product of two Hecke operators. This is the product in the Hecke algebra, which is commutative even though the group is the modular group, which is non-abelian, and the subgroup is an arithmetic subgroup and in particular does not contain the commutator subgroup. Commutativity of the convolution product is closely tied to Gelfand pairs. When the group is a topological group, it is possible to weaken the assumption that the number of left and right cosets in each double coset is finite. The group algebra is replaced by an algebra of functions such as or , and the sums are replaced by integrals. The product still corresponds to convolution. For instance, this happens for the Hecke algebra of a locally compact group.  Applications  When a group G has a transitive group action on a set S, computing certain double coset decompositions of G reveals extra information about structure of the action of G on S . Specifically, if H is the stabilizer subgroup of some element s\\\\in S , then G decomposes as exactly two double cosets of (H,H) if and only if G acts transitively on the set of distinct pairs of S. See 2-transitive groups for more information about this action. Double cosets are important in connection with representation theory, when a representation of is used to construct an induced representation of , which is then restricted to . The corresponding double coset structure carries information about how the resulting representation decomposes. In the case of finite groups, this is Mackey's decomposition theorem. They are also important in functional analysis, where in some important cases functions left-invariant and right-invariant by a subgroup can form a commutative ring under convolution: see Gelfand pair.

I-22 is also Corridor X of the Appalachian Development Highway System. Designated in 2012, I-22 follows the route of the older U.S. Route 78. The freeway mainly spans rural areas and passes numerous small towns along its route, including Jasper, Winfield, and Hamilton, Alabama; and Fulton, Tupelo, New Albany, and Holly Springs, Mississippi. I-22 was upgraded to Interstate Highway standards to close a gap in the Interstate Highway System, allowing for more direct connections between cities in the southeast with cities in the central part of the country. I-22 indirectly connects I-240, I-40, I-55, and I-69 in the Memphis metropolitan area via US 78 and I-269 with I-65 and I-20/I-59 in Birmingham. Route description Western terminus at I-269 in Byhalia, MS Eastern terminus at I-65 in Birmingham, AL as of 2020 I-22 serves as a connection between Birmingham and suburban Memphis, filling in a gap in the Interstate Highway System. It begins at an interchange with I-269 at Byhalia, Mississippi approximately from downtown Memphis and travels southeast across northern Mississippi and Alabama, before ending at an interchange with I-65 approximately north of downtown Birmingham, Alabama. While I-22 itself does not continue past I-269 to Memphis, some believe that an I-22 spur route may be named along the existing US 78 from I-269 northwest to the Tennessee state line. =Mississippi= Potts Camp I-22 begins at an interchange with I-269 at Byhalia in northwestern Mississippi and continues across rural areas, connecting towns such as Fulton, Tupelo, New Albany, and Holly Springs. =Alabama= ADHS shields in Marion County I-22 continues across rural areas in northwestern Alabama, and connects the towns of Jasper, Winfield, and Hamilton before ending at an interchange with I-65 approximately north of downtown Birmingham. History The concept of a Memphis-to- Birmingham expressway was discussed as early as the 1950s, but did not move beyond talk for more than 20 years. When studies for I-22 began, the highway was proposed to continue west to downtown Memphis, Tennessee and end at Interstate 240 and Interstate 69. Several other proposals were also considered. One took I-22 along I-269 to I-55/I-69 and another took it along Crump Boulevard to end at Interstate 55, but those plans never materialized. The part of I-22 just east of Fulton, Mississippi, was approved by Congress as \\"Corridor X\\" in 1978, as a part of the Appalachian Development Highway System, and parts of I-22 have been under construction ever since. Corridor X was also designated as \\"High Priority Corridor 10\\" in the Federal National Highway System Designation Act of 1995, and as \\"High Priority Corridor 45\\" in later legislation. Over the many years of development, the project changed multiple times. In 2004, Corridor X was designated as Future I-22 by Public Law Number 108-199, and the designation was made official on April 18, 2005. In Alabama and Mississippi, blue signs reading \\"FUTURE/I-22/CORRIDOR\\" at left and an I-22 shield with \\"FUTURE\\" instead of \\"INTERSTATE\\" at the right were unveiled on April 18, 2005. The first major completed section of the route between the Mississippi state line and Jasper was opened to traffic on November 22, 2005. Exits on the Jasper Bypass portion of I-22 were originally numbered using a kilometer-based sequence because at the time this stretch was opened it appeared that all highways in the U.S. were going to be measured using the metric system. The final decision was made to remain using miles, and they have been renumbered according to the highway's mileposts. A segment between Graysville and Brookside was opened in June 2007, and another section of Future I-22 between Jasper and Graysville was opened in November 2007. A segment between Cherry Avenue in Forestdale to a point about short of I-65 near Fultondale, including an interchange with Coalburg Road, was opened in December 2009. Next came the connection of I-22 with I-65 and US 31. The Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) widened Coalburg Road from its interchange with I-22 southward to Daniel Payne Drive (which leads to I-65) to allow heavy trucks to use it; this project was nearly complete as of May 2015. Signs are now in place on Daniel Payne Drive (westbound) informing truckers that access to I-22 is not allowed from Daniel Payne Drive. ALDOT was to award contracts in August 2009 for the construction of the final segment of I-22, including its large interchange with I-65 and US 31, with the construction to begin shortly afterwards. Funding delays postponed these into 2010, however. On March 19, 2010, President Barack Obama signed the HIRE (Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment) Act into law, which included an extension of federal highway funding through the end of 2010. This extension gave the ALDOT the opportunity to proceed with its plans for the construction of final segment of I-22 in Alabama. The opening of the bids for this project began on May 21, 2010. ALDOT announced on June 16, 2010, that the project has been awarded to the company Archer Western Contractors for $168.6 million. The project is the most expensive highway project ever undertaken in Jefferson County, and it is the highest-priced contract awarded by the ALDOT as of 2010. On November 12, 2012, ALDOT's application for establishing I-22 was conditionally approved by AASHTO at a special committee, pending for MDOT to submit their own application for I-22 and FHWA approval. This therefore officially established the existence of I-22. In April 2013, the first actual Interstate 22 shields were deployed in Marion County, Alabama, immediately east of the Mississippi state line. Such signs will extend east at least through Walker County into the outskirts of Birmingham. On August 21, 2014, ALDOT reported that I-22's interchange with I-65 would not be completed until October 2015. The interchange's connections via exit 95 to I-65 and the continuation over I-65 as exit 95C at US 31 remained under construction. In March 2016, the intersection with I-65 and continuation to US 31 was still under construction. New lanes north and southbound were opened on I-65 passing through the interchange and construction and painting operations were carried out on the I-22 entrance and exit ramps. The interchange to I-65 opened to traffic on June 20, 2016, while the connector to US 31 remained under construction. Mississippi officials announced May 5, 2015 that the state officially began the process to designate its portion as I-22. The two requirements to be able to apply for this designation were to upgrade the route to interstate standards and to connect to an existing interstate within 25 years; this was completed when I-269 was opened in December 2017. The I-65 interchange was opened in October 2015. The route was officially signed in Mississippi in a ceremony on October 23, 2015. Exit list Auxiliary routes =Interstate 222= Interstate 222 (I-222) is a future Auxiliary Interstate Highway to be a connector between I-22/US 78 and the proposed I-422 near Birmingham, Alabama. There will be no exits other than its termini. The highway has been proposed because an interchange directly between I-22 and I-422 cannot be built because of environmental issues. AASHTO approved the designation on May 18, 2012. Construction on this new route has not been scheduled at this time. =Interstate 422= I-422 is a future northwestern bypass of Birmingham, connecting between I-20/I-59, from the southwest, and I-59, in the northeast. It will also be connected with I-22 via I-222, in Brookside, located northwest of Birmingham. It was first proposed in May 2009 by U.S. Congressman Spencer Bachus; on May 18, 2012, it was approved by AASHTO.

Technically, it is an unpredictable change in exogenous factors ‚Äî that is, factors unexplained by an economic model ‚Äî which may influence endogenous economic variables. The response of economic variables, such as production and employment, at the time of the shock and at subsequent times, is measured by an impulse response function. Types of shocks A technology shock is the kind resulting from a technological development that affects productivity. If the shock is due to constrained supply, it is termed a supply shock and usually results in price increases for a particular product. Supply shocks can be produced when accidents or disasters occur. The 2008 Western Australian gas crisis resulting from a pipeline explosion at Varanus Island is one example. An inflationary shock happens when prices of commodities increase suddenly (e.g., after a decrease of government subsidies) while not all salaries are adjusted immediately throughout society (this results in a temporary loss of purchasing power for many consumers); or that production costs begin to exceed corporate revenues (e.g. following energy price hikes). Stock exchanges in the wake of the September 11 attacks. After the initial panic, the DJIA increased quickly for only a slight net decrease. A demand shock is a sudden change of the pattern of private expenditure, especially of consumption spending by consumers or of investment spending by businesses. A monetary policy shock occurs when a central bank changes, without sufficient advance warning, its pattern of interest rate or money supply control. A fiscal policy shock is an unexpected change of government spending or taxation amounts. In the context of microeconomics, shocks are also studied at the household level, such as health, income, and consumption shocks. Negative individual and household economic shocks can result from job loss, for example, while positive shocks can come from winning the lottery. For example, in development microeconomics the relationship between household income shocks and household levels of consumption is studied to understand a household's ability to insure itself (testing the full-insurance hypothesis). Political impact Economic shocks impact political preference. The experience of negative shocks such as job loss causes individuals to favor redistributive policies and broader social policies. Some evidence shows that negative economic shocks cause individuals to lose faith in political systems, though this erosion of trust is often temporary, rebounding over time. A narrow portion of voters may change their voting patterns in response to shock, which can include support for candidates and policies that are antiestablishment, populist, leftist, or ceasing to participate in the electoral process. Positive economic shocks are linked to an increase in trust in government institutions.

This helps the bacteria evade detection and phagocytosis by the immune system. Coagulase is a protein enzyme produced by several microorganisms that enables the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. In the laboratory, it is used to distinguish between different types of Staphylococcus isolates. Importantly, S. aureus is generally coagulase- positive, meaning that a positive coagulase test would indicate the presence of S. aureus or any of the other 11 coagulase-positive Staphylococci.Becker et al., 2014. PMID: 25278577 A negative coagulase test would instead show the presence of coagulase-negative organisms such as S. epidermidis or S. saprophyticus. However, it is now known that not all S. aureus are coagulase- positive.Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors) (2004). Sherris Medical Microbiology (4th ed.). McGraw Hill. .PreTest, Surgery, 12th ed., p.88 It is also produced by Yersinia pestis. Coagulase reacts with prothrombin in the blood. The resulting complex is called staphylothrombin, which enables the enzyme to act as a protease to convert fibrinogen, a plasma protein produced by the liver, to fibrin. This results in clotting of the blood. Coagulase is tightly bound to the surface of the bacterium S. aureus and can coat its surface with fibrin upon contact with blood. The fibrin clot may protect the bacterium from phagocytosis and isolate it from other defenses of the host. The fibrin coat can therefore make the bacteria more virulent. Bound coagulase is part of the larger family of MSCRAMM adhesin proteins.  Coagulase test  The coagulase test has traditionally been used to differentiate Staphylococcus aureus from coagulase-negative staphylococci. S.aureus produces two forms of coagulase (i.e., bound coagulase and free coagulase). Bound coagulase, otherwise known as \\"clumping factor\\", can be detected by carrying out a slide coagulase test, and free coagulase can be detected using a tube coagulase test. = Slide test = A slide coagulase test is run with a negative control to rule out autoagglutination. Two drops of saline are put onto the slide labeled with sample number, Test (T) and control (C). The two saline drops are emulsified with the test organism using a wire loop, straight wire, or wooden stick. A drop of plasma (rabbit plasma anticoagulated with EDTA is recommended) is placed on the inoculated saline drop corresponding to test, and mixed well, then the slide is rocked gently for about 10 seconds. * If 'positive', macroscopic clumping would be observed in the plasma within 10 seconds, with no clumping in the saline drop. * If 'negative', no clumping will be observed. If the slide coagulase test is negative, a tube test should follow as a confirmation. Clumping in both drops is an indication of autoagglutination, so a tube test should be carried out. Tube test is not performed each institutions but most of the result depends on blood cultures from lab. = Tube test = A fibrin clot formed in a test tube by the coagulase reaction The tube test uses rabbit plasma that has been inoculated with a staphylococcal colony (i.e., Gram-positive cocci which are catalase positive). The tube is then incubated at 37 ¬∞C for 1.5 hours. If negative, then incubation is continued up to 18 hours. * If 'positive' (e.g., the suspect colony is S. aureus), the plasma will coagulate, resulting in a clot (sometimes the clot is so pronounced, the liquid will completely solidify). * If 'negative', the plasma remains a liquid. The negative result may be S. epidermidis but only a more detailed identification test can confirm this, using biochemical tests as in analytical profile index tests methods. A false negative can be perceived if the sample is not allowed to cool for about 30 minutes at room temperature or 10 minutes in the freezer, given that the serum can melt. If truly negative, the serum will remain liquid after cooling. * List of coagulase-positive staphylococci: Staphylococcus aureus subsp. anaerobius, S. aureus subsp. aureus, S. delphini, S. hyicus, S. intermedius, S. lutrae, and Staphylococcus schleiferi subsp. coagulans. * List of coagulase-negative staphylococci of clinical significance: S. saprophyticus, S.cohnii subsp. cohnii, S. cohnii subsp. urealyticum, S. captitus subsp. captitus, S. warneri, S.hominis, S.epidermidis, S. caprae, and S.lugdunensis References External links * Tube coagulase test - rabbit plasma video  Coagulase test procedure Microbiology EC 3.4.23 ","title":"Coagulase"},{"id":"982833","text":"Steve Ramsey is a British guitarist who began his career with the British heavy metal band Satan in the early 1980s, releasing a single and an album, a second album under the band name Blind Fury, an EP and another album after changing the band name back to Satan and two more albums after renaming the band name once again, to Pariah.

The school's first commander was Squadron Commander Douglas Evill. Initially, aircraft had to be transported from their temporary hangars to the top of the nearby cliff, then lowered by crane onto a trolley which ran on rails into the sea. Permanent hangars, workshops, accommodation and a new double slipway were soon constructed, however.HMS Daedalus Heritage: Early Days 1917‚Äì1920 - Fleet Air Arm Archive. =Royal Air Force use= On 1 April 1918, the RNAS combined with the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) to form the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Lee-on-Solent Naval Seaplane Training School became an RAF station.

As a consequence, on 24 May 1939, HQ RAF Coastal Command moved to Northwood and Lee-on-Solent was commissioned as HMS Daedalus, becoming Headquarters of Flag Officer Air (Home).

In March 2006 the site was split, with ownership of the central area including the runways transferred to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) who have continued to use it as a base for their air sea rescue helicopters. Hampshire Constabulary's fixed wing aircraft also continued to use the airfield. The outlying areas, including the former accommodation and technical area and surrounding land, hangars, and dispersals, were transferred to the In April 2006, Gosport and Fareham Borough Councils issued a stating that \\"There should be provision of leisure and community facilities which could complement existing facilities to the benefit of local residents\\" and \\"Future development should seek to maximise the benefit of the existing runways for general and private aviation use.\\". In April/May 2006, whilst conducting repairs to the runway, building crews discovered an unexploded pipe bomb, of over 60 feet long, placed underneath the runway by the military, designed to cripple the airfield's operational capabilities in the event of a German invasion. The bomb (along with 19 others subsequently discovered) was scheduled to be removed in September 2006. The work was completed on 24 October 2006. During its RN ownership the airfield had been used for a variety of groups, including the The Lee Bees Model Flying Club, The Tigers Children's Motorcycle Display Team and two flying schools, and a number of privately owned aircraft were based at the airfield. When the RN moved out in 1996, operational management of the airfield was taken over by Hampshire Police Air Support Unit (HPASU). This management continued until October 2010, with HPASU being tenants of the MCA, which is an Executive Agency of the Department for Transport. In October 2010 Hampshire Police Air Support Unit was closed and its tasks taken over by the newly formed South East Air Support Unit covering Hampshire, Sussex and Surrey from bases at RAF Odiham and Shoreham Airport. On acquiring their land SEEDA stated \\"The lack of availability of serviced employment land and new business space has been identified as an important requirement in South Hampshire. Our intention is that development of the site will focus on new aviation and marine related businesses, exploiting access to the existing runways and the Solent. Plans are to create a quality business location that will attract inward investment and provide accommodation for start-up, growing and established businesses\\". Aviation-related businesses, including an aircraft maintenance organisation, a microlight aircraft manufacturer and a flying school, became tenants of SEEDA in 2006, as did the owners of around 50 aircraft based on the site. The aerodrome is strategically important. The growth of commercial air transport at Southampton Airport some years ago left it with no capacity for general aviation (GA) aircraft. This leaves Lee-on-Solent as the only airfield in southern Hampshire with a hard runway available for general aviation; the nearest alternative in Hampshire being Farnborough Airfield. On 18 October 2007, users were given 30 days notice by the Airfield Manager that the aerodrome would be closed to all existing users except MCA, HPASU and PNGC from 16 November 2007. The closure was successfully challenged by Lee Flying Association which worked with other agencies such as the Civil Aviation Authority and AOPA to develop new operating procedures, an Airfield Manual and an air-to-ground service and the airfield is now operating as a licensed general aviation airfield.Lee Flying Association history In May 2008 the closure decision was reversed. From 1 April 2011, the airfield was leased to the British aircraft manufacturer, Britten-NormanBritten-Norman under its airfield operations subsidiary, Fly BN.Fly BN Britten-Norman established corporate offices at the Daedalus Airfield site as well as a manufacturing base for its subsidiary Britten- Norman AircraftBritten-Norman Aircraft and MRO facilities for two other subsidiaries, BN DefenceBN Defence and BN Aviation.BN Aviation Now managed by Fly BN on behalf of the airfield's new owner, the Homes and Communities Agency, the airfield was prepared for licensed operations. In August 2011 the government announced that the airfield would host an enterprise zone named the Solent Enterprise Zone. Current use On 1 April 2015 the airfield owners, Fareham Borough Council, appointed Regional and City Airports Management on a 5-year contract to manage the airfield. New entrances have been constructed to eliminate the need for runway crossings by vehicles and redevelopment is underway. CEMAST (Centre of Engineering, Manufacturing and Advanced Skills Training), part of Fareham College is completed on previously undeveloped land in the south east corner of the airfield. Wartime Hangar A has been demolished to make way for a new Innovation Centre of business starter units to the south of the South Apron on the east side. Temporary hangars are to be placed on the sites of Bellman Hangars 2 and 3, which were destroyed in a wartime air raid to accommodate aircraft which are having to be moved from Hangars East while redevelopment takes place. The old MARTSU building is to be demolished and replaced by a factory. The new development at Hangars East includes new roads and infrastructure and hangars for aviation use with runway access. In September 2017 it was announced that Solent Airport (Daedalus) is to open up scheduled flights, with destinations possibly including Alderney, Cardiff, Swansea and Exeter. The Daily Echo reports that there may also be a small passenger terminal to accommodate the up to 20 seater planes.http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/15529311.Plans_unveiled_to_offer_commercial_flights_from_airport_near_Fareham/ In May 2018, Portsmouth Naval Gliding Centre announced that it would not be remaining at the site after its eviction notice on 31 May 2018. The charity stated this was because the airfield owners, Fareham Borough Council, had been unable to offer them a viable replacement to their current hangar, Belman 4, from which they had been served eviction notice for.

These polities existed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and had similar and yet sometimes distinct cultures, values and traditions. The Great Lakes kingdoms were found in Southeast Africa and some parts of Central Africa, in what is present-day northwest Tanzania, south Uganda, some parts of Rwanda, and Eastern Congo. *Bunyoro *Buganda *Bugisu *Bukedi *Burundi *Busoga *Buvinza *Buyungu *Buzinza *Gisaka *Heru *Igara *Ihangiro *Karagwe *Kimwani *Kiziba *Kyamutwara *Kyania *Lango *Mpororo *Mubari *Muhambwe *Nkore *Ruguru *Rusubi *Rwanda *Rwenzururu *Sebei *Teso *Tooro Great Lakes Region: Karagwe, Nkore, and Buhaya Karagwe, Nkore, and Buhaya formed small neighboring states to the major kingdoms of Bunyoro and Buganda in the Great Lakes region. Karagwe and Nkore were individual polities, while Buhaya refers to an area along the western side of Lake Victoria in which seven small states were recognized: Kiamutwara, Kiziba, Ihangiro, Kihanja, Bugabo, Maruku, and Missenye. Although this entry only deals with the period up to the end of the eighteenth century, it is essential to recognize that the earlier histories of these polities and the detail with which they have been recorded are a direct product of nineteenth- and twentieth-century history and the circumstances which befell them. Nkore (Ankole in colonial times) found itself within the British Protectorate of Uganda and became a cornerstone of Protectorate policy, being one of the four main kingdoms and enjoying a considerably enlarged territorial status under the Protectorate than it had done in precolonial times. It was also served well by various missionaries, ethnographers, anthropologists, and historians. Buhaya was moderately well served, partly through expedient politics in the early colonial era and the siting of the regional colonial administrative center in Bukoba. By contrast, Karagwe fell from being one of the most powerful of the nineteenth century states in the Great Lakes, a position it had largely attained through its domination of early Indian Ocean-Great Lakes trade routes, to total collapse and obscurity by 1916. Writers on Karagwe have been sporadic and have failed to provide the rich array of texts that are available for Nkore, its northern neighbor. In independent Tanzania, under Nyerere, there was little place for such overtly unequal, precolonial political formations. Not surprisingly, the earliest farming settlements appeared in the wet coastal littoral of Buhaya, on the western shores of Lake Victoria. Archaeological research has indicated extensive activity, most notably in terms of iron smelting, from the last few centuries BCE. These societies exploited the extensive rainforests that were available at the time and, after initial cultivation of yams and other forest crops, presumably became proficient in the exploitation of bananas. Linguistic and archaeological evidence in Karagwe and Nkore on the other hand, indicates occupation around the beginning of the second millennium, based upon the increasing exploitation of cattle, supported by grain crops. From these bases, the core elements of the polities undoubtedly developed, although there is little evidence, as yet, to document the process. The actual origins of the dynasties that came to dominate are also unclear, being dependent on the interpretation of oral traditions. At face value, in all areas, dynasties claimed origin back to the Cwezi persona, Wamara. Subsequently, power fell into the hands of Ruhinda, and descent was directly drawn to him by many of the royal clans, known as Abahinda. Reinterpretations of these oral traditions suggest that characters such as Wamara and Ruhinda may well have been charismatic chiefs, who, after their deaths, became important spirits controlled by mediums tied to political power. Shrines to Wamara and Ruhinda were specifically associated with the manipulation and control of fertility. A further integral component of these polities was clans. Each polity was an amalgamation of clans, and each clan contributed important components to the polity. Clans involved in the polity at an earlier stage tended to be regarded with a higher status. Clans were also associated with specialized activity, such as cattle-herding, iron- smelting, and regulating rituals. The royal clan sat atop this confederation and carefully maintained the status quo, by allocating particular offices to specific clans and by accepting wives for the king from the different clans. Thus, the mother of the king and her clan were very powerful in each individual reign, and this power helps to explain the regularity of succession disputes revealed by oral traditions. Particularly in drier Karagwe and Nkore, there was also an increasing importance in the distinction between cattle- herding Bahima and farmers. In later years, these economic pastimes became almost mutually exclusive and were the foundations of class formation. It is significant, however, that although kings generally leaned toward pastoralism as an ideal lifestyle, even in the later centuries the king stood above the cattle-agriculture dichotomy, practicing rituals which were integral to both economic forms. Most notably, every month kings conducted the New Moon rituals which ensured the fertility of the land and the fecundity of cattle. Furthermore, at least some kings were also regarded as iron smiths (but not smelters). The best-known example of this was the incorporation of iron- working hammers into the royal regalia of Karagwe, generally associated with Omukama Ndagara in the early nineteenth century. These fairly simplistic reconstructions, of course, mask the major tensions and conflicts that existed within these states. An insight into such political intrigue has been provided by the historical work focusing on the Kaijja shrine, within the Maruku kingdom, twenty kilometers south of Bukoba. The site is the gashani, or jaw- bone shrine, of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century king, Rugomora Mahe, who is said to have occupied the site and to have overseen iron-working there. The site is also an important shrine to the Cwezi spirit, Wamara. All the Buhaya states record a change from Hinda to Bito rulers around the seventeenth century, referring to the extension of Bito dynastic influence from Bunyoro. Significantly, Rugomora Mahe was an early Bito ruler, and his association with the shrine is interpreted as an integral part of the ritual conflict between Hinda followers and their spirits, and the new Bito rulers. At broadly similar times oral traditions in Karagwe and Nkore record incursions and even lengthy occupations by forces from Bunyoro, but emphasize ultimate victory over the invaders. In Nkore, it has been possible to identify sites associated with political authority, extending several centuries back into the past. The locations of these sites indicate that the early core Nkore area was in a restricted highland area, Isingiro, twenty kilometers south of the modern center of Mbarara. The suggestion is therefore that these were initially very localized political formations, some of which gradually expanded. Military power was initially realized in terms of numbers. The Buhaya states were all small and do not appear to have had a significant military capability. Karagwe does appear to have had military strength, and this may have been due to its greater population size. Nkore, from its small base, does not appear to have had expansionist pretensions, or more importantly, capability, until key changes in its military organization. The creation of permanent levies of troops, known as Emitwe, allowed both the conquest of territory such as Mpororo and Buhweju and also the protection of its increasing herds from powerful neighbors to the north. It is important to emphasize that, in their early stages, all these polities were small and vulnerable. In particular, they appear to have been susceptible to succession disputes, which seem to have been the main cause of conflict. More detailed histories of significant changes in structure and organization only really begin to emerge toward the end of the eighteenth century, when some polities started looking beyond their frontiers for new territories and resources to control.

It stars Sam Rockwell, Mos Def, Zooey Deschanel, Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy, Anna Chancellor, John Malkovich, and the voices of Stephen Fry, Helen Mirren, Thomas Lennon, Richard Griffiths, Ian McNeice, Bill Bailey and Alan Rickman. Adams co-wrote the screenplay with Karey Kirkpatrick but died in 2001, before production began; the film is dedicated to him. The film grossed over $100 million worldwide.  Plot  One Thursday morning, Arthur Dent discovers that his house is to be immediately demolished to make way for a bypass. He tries delaying the bulldozers by lying down in front of them. Ford Prefect, a friend of Arthur's, convinces him to go to a pub with him. Over several pints of beer, Ford explains that he is an alien from the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and a journalist working on the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a universal guide book. Ford warns that the Earth is to be demolished later that day by a race called Vogons, to make way for a hyperspace bypass. As the Vogon fleet arrives in orbit to destroy Earth, Ford rescues Arthur by stowing aboard one of the Vogon ships. The pair are shortly discovered and thrown out an airlock, only to be picked up by the starship Heart of Gold. They find Ford's \\"semi-cousin\\" Zaphod Beeblebrox, the newly elected president of the Galaxy. He has stolen the ship along with Tricia \\"Trillian\\" McMillan, an Earth woman whom Arthur had met previously, and Marvin the Paranoid Android, a clinically depressed robot. Zaphod seeks the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything to match with the disappointing answer given by the supercomputer Deep Thought: \\"42\\". He believes that the answer lies on the planet Magrathea, only accessible using the Heart of Gold improbability drive through trial and error. On one attempt, they arrive at Viltvodle VI, where Zaphod's opponent, Humma Kavula, resides. Kavula offers the coordinates for Magrathea in exchange for Zaphod recovering the Point-of-View gun, a gun created by Deep Thought that makes anyone it blasts temporarily see things from the same perspective as the person that fired the gun at them. Trillian is captured by the Vogons as they depart, and the three mount a rescue effort on the Vogon homeworld. Before her rescue, Trillian learns that Zaphod gave the order for the destruction of Earth, thinking that the Vogon with the permission form just wanted his autograph. The group escapes the Vogons, followed by Galactic Vice- President Questular Rontok and the Vogons. They arrive at Magrathea, but trigger its automated missile defense systems. Arthur re-activates the improbability drive to transform the missiles into a bowl of petunias and a whale, allowing them to safely land on the planet. Zaphod, Ford, and Trillian enter a portal to arrive at Deep Thought, though Arthur and Marvin are stranded outside the portal. They learn from Deep Thought that after coming up with the Answer \\"42\\", its creators had Deep Thought design another computer to come up with the Question, that being Earth. They recover the Point-of-View gun, though Trillian uses it on Zaphod to show him her resentment for his accidental destruction of the Earth. They are captured by unknown entities. Meanwhile, on Magrathea, Arthur is met by Slartibartfast, one of the planet builders. Slartibartfast takes Arthur to a pocket dimension inside the planet where he shows that a new version of Earth is near completion. Slartibartfast takes Arthur to his recreated home, where inside, the others are enjoying a feast provided by the pan-dimensional beings who commissioned Arthur's original Earth, and who resemble a pair of mice. With Arthur, who was on Earth up until the last minutes, the mice think they can discover the Question by removing his brain. Arthur manages to escape and crush the mice under a teapot; they disappear without a trace. Suddenly, Questular and the Vogons arrive outside the home and open fire. The group takes shelter in a caravan, but Marvin, left alone, uses the Point-of-View gun to make the entire Vogon force too depressed to continue fighting. The Vogons are taken away, while Zaphod reunites with Questular. Arthur decides to explore the galaxy with Ford and Trillian, allowing Slartibartfast to finalise the new Earth without him. The Heart of Gold crew decides to visit the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. Cast * Sam Rockwell as Zaphod Beeblebrox, the President of the Galaxy.

Pre-production and production Preparations for the premiere of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy on Leicester Square. Bringing The Hitchhiker's Guide to a theatrical version started as early as the 1970s, as documented in The Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made by David Hughes. Douglas Adams had been approached by one unnamed producer and separately by the American Broadcasting Company network during the 1970s to turn the book into a film, but Adams refused both offers, as he feared they wanted to turn the work into \\"Star Wars with jokes\\". In 1982, Adams signed an option for the film with producers Ivan Reitman, Joe Medjuck, and Michael C. Gross, and completed three scripts for them. As part of the rewrites, Medjuck and Gross offered the idea of bringing in either Bill Murray or Dan Aykroyd to play Ford Prefect. However, Aykroyd separately proposed a different story to Reitman, which lead to this project becoming the basis for Ghostbusters. This left Adams flustered about the film's development in making sure there was the necessary commitment to the project. However, the event did serve the idea of making Prefect an American as to better draw in that audience. Movement on the film was quiet until around 2001, when director Jay Roach, using the clout he had gained from Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery and Meet the Parents, secured a new deal with Adams and production through Disney. Adams wrote a new script, and Roach sought talent like Spike Jonze to direct, Hugh Laurie to play Arthur, and Jim Carrey as Zaphod, but then Adams died on 11 May 2001. Neither Roach nor the film's executive producer Robbie Stamp wanted to see their work go for naught after Adams' death. Roach brought in Karey Kirkpatrick to complete the screenplay based on Adams' final draft, submitted just before his death. Kirkpatrick used what notes Adams had left, finding that Adams was willing to go off the book's narrative to adapt to the film. He considered his screenplay something in the spirit that Adams had set out based on the whole of Adams' work. Some time after Adams' death, Roach decided to drop out of the project, and, on recommendation from Spike Jonze ‚Äì one of several directors asked to do the film ‚Äì Roach turned to director Garth Jennings and producer Nick Goldsmith, collectively known as Hammer & Tongs, to take up the work. In a Slashdot interview, Robbie Stamp, one of the film's executive producers, stated the following about the cast of the film: * The hardest character to cast was \\"the voice of the Guide itself and in the end came back to somebody who was one of the people Douglas himself had wanted, namely Stephen Fry.\\" * \\"Douglas himself is on record as saying that as far as he was concerned the only character who had to be British, indeed English, was Arthur Dent.\\" Stamp also commented on how large a role the studio and screenwriters other than Adams played in making the film: * \\"I think that a lot of fans would be surprised to know just how much of a free hand we have been given in the making of this movie. I know how easy it is to see every decision to cut a scene as 'studio' pressure but it was always much more to do with pacing and rhythm in the film itself.\\" * \\"The script we shot was very much based on the last draft that Douglas wrote... All the substantive new ideas in the movie... are brand new Douglas ideas written especially for the movie by him... Douglas was always up for reinventing HHGG in each of its different incarnations and he knew that working harder on some character development and some of the key relationships was an integral part of turning HHGG into a movie.\\" Shooting was completed in August 2004, and the movie was released on 28 April 2005 in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, and on the following day in Canada and the United States. The pre-title sequence of the film was shot in Loro Parque, Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife. =Marketing= The film trailer featured voice over work by Stephen Fry as the Guide, describing the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxys entry on movie trailers. An audio collection called \\"Additional Guide Entries\\", read by Stephen Fry, was released to iTunes to promote the film. The entries were set to music by Joby Talbot and written by Tim Browse and Sean Soll√© (with the exception of the How to be Cool entry, which was also co-written by Yoz Grahame). The \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to Technology\\" claims that if you make yourself a cup of tea and attempt to get an object working and the tea goes cold before you finish, you are dealing with technology. Other guides include the Hitchhiker's Guide to Blogging, the Hitchhiker's Guide to Deadlines, and the Hitchhiker's Guide to How to be Cool which discusses how an individual can truly be cool, instead of by following crowds, but concludes by suggesting the listener attend a showing of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The Guide to Websites, which only appeared on the official UK movie website, described a website as \\"a wonderful new invention that allows people you neither know nor care about to inform you what they had for breakfast this morning, without all that tedious mucking about in the postal system\\". The Guide to Fanboys, written by Touchstone Pictures' copywriters as part of their promotion of the movie, only ever appeared as website text. Though released at the same time as the iTunes entries, it was never intended to be recorded and is otherwise unconnected with the Fry/Talbot/Browse works. Reception =Critical reaction= Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 60% of 200 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.09/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"A frantic and occasional funny adaptation of Douglas Adams' novel. However, it may have those unfamiliar with the source material scratching their heads.\\" Metacritic gives it 63/100, indicating \\"generally favourable\\" reviews. Empire magazine rated the film four stars out of five and said it was a \\"very British, very funny sci-fi misadventure that's guaranteed to win converts\\". Roger Ebert, gave the film two stars out of four: Manohla Dargis called it \\"hugely likable\\" with a story arc structured \\"more or less\\" as \\"a long beginning and then an ending\\"; she calls Jim Henson's Creature Shop's Vogons \\"beautifully constructed\\" and noted that Sam Rockwell's performance is \\"sensational, ... riffing on Elvis and the current President George Bush\\". Peter Bradshaw gave the film three stars out of five and said, \\"The film is no disgrace, and honours the Guide's gentle, low-tech BBC origins. But it doesn't do justice to the open-ended inventiveness of the original. The inevitable Anglo-American accommodations of casting have muddled its identity and the performances of the new American stars can be uneasy. It somehow seems heavier-footed and slower-moving than Adams's concept; the gravity is stronger... The savour and flavour of the Adams original, its playfully ruminative feel, has been downgraded in favour of a jolly but less interesting outerspace romp.\\" Philip French, after describing the Vogons as \\"a species resembling Laughton's version of Quasimodo\\" and writing it is \\"not, except in its financing, anything resembling a standard Hollywood production\\", called the film \\"slightly old-fashioned (few things date as rapidly as science fiction and our view of the future) and somewhat commonplace through its embracing familiar special effects. The jokes have to compete with the hardware and the actors executing them often exude a feeling of desperation... It's funnier, and obviously cleverer, than Spaceballs, Mel Brooks's puerile spoof on Star Wars, but a good bit less engaging than Galaxy Quest.\\" =Commercial box office= The movie was released on 28 April 2005 in the United Kingdom making ¬£4,200,000 in its first week. It was released a day later in North America, making $21,103,203 in its opening weekend, opening in first place. In the United States, the movie remained in the box office top ten for its first four weeks of release. The movie's total box office gross was $104,478,416 worldwide. According to Freeman, the film would unlikely merit a sequel; he stated \\"I found that out from the horse's mouth, [director] Garth Jennings. I had dinner with him and he said [the first one] just didn't do well enough.\\" =Awards= The movie was nominated for seven different awards and won one. It won the Golden Trailer Award under the category Most Original. It was nominated for: the Artios award from Casting Society of America, United States under the category Best Featured Film Casting-Comedy in 2005; the Empire Awards from Empire Awards, UK under the categories Best British Film and Best Comedy in 2006; the Golden Trailer from Golden Trailer Awards under the category Best Voice Over; and Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie: Action and Choice Rap Artist in a Movie: Mos Def.Full list of all award nominations for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy at IMDb. Soundtrack The complete motion picture soundtrack was released as an iTunes Music Store exclusive (in the United States and the United Kingdom) on 12 April 2005, two weeks before the scheduled CD release. The iTunes Music Store also has two further exclusive sets of tracks related to the movie: * The Marvin Mixes are remixes of a new version of \\"Reasons to be Miserable\\", here performed by Stephen Fry, as well as a new vocal and a new instrumental track for \\"Marvin\\", also performed by Fry. Stephen Moore had recorded the vocals of both tracks in 1981. * The Guide Entries are new spoken \\"Hitchhiker's Guide\\" entries, all read by Fry, with accompanying music by Joby Talbot (with further orchestrations by Christopher Austin), who wrote the film score. The soundtrack CD was released on 26 April 2005, by Hollywood Records. The CD has the same 33 tracks as the previous iTunes release. The enclosed booklet includes acknowledgements from Joby Talbot and notes on the creation of the song \\"So Long and Thanks for All the Fish\\", written by Garth Jennings. The track \\"Huma's Hymn\\" on the soundtrack is notable for the fact that it was sung in St. Michael's Church in Highgate, London by members of local church choirs along with a congregation consisting of members of the public. The recording was open to anyone wishing to attend, and was publicised on the internet, including in a post to the Usenet group alt.fan.douglas-adams.Message announcing the recording of \\"Humma's Hymn\\" on the news:alt.fan.douglas-adams newsgroup The first version of the song \\"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\\" is a Broadway-style, lively version sung by the dolphins before they leave Earth. The second plays over the end credits and is in the style of Smooth jazz. The song was written by English composer Joby Talbot, conductor Christopher Austin, and director Garth Jennings and performed by the Tenebrae Choir. Neil Hannon, founder and frontman of the Irish pop group The Divine Comedy, of which Talbot is a former member, lent his vocals to the version of the song played during the ending credits. The song, in its \\"bouncy\\", opening version, was translated into and performed in Spanish for the Latin-American Region 4 DVD release. A reworked version of the theme from the 1981 television adaptation was also included in the score. Home media The movie was released on DVD (Region 2, PAL) in the United Kingdom on 5 September 2005. Both a standard double disc edition and a UK-exclusive \\"Gift Set\\" edition were released on this date. The standard double disc edition features: * Making-of * Additional guide entries (see marketing, above) * Deleted scenes * Really deleted scenes (scenes that were never really meant to be in the movie, just for fun) * Sing-a-long * Audio commentaries * Set Top Games: Marvin's Hangman * Don't Crash (68-minute UK exclusive \\"making of\\" documentary, directed by Grant Gee) The \\"Gift Set\\" edition includes a copy of the novel with a \\"movie tie-in\\" cover, and collectible prints from the film, packaged in a replica of the film's version of the Hitchhiker's Guide prop. Single disc widescreen and full-screen editions (Region 1, NTSC) were released in the United States and Canada on 13 September 2005. They have a different cover, but contain the same special features (except the Don't Crash documentary) as the UK version.

Types Some of the more common are: * Endodontic (surgery involving the pulp or root of the tooth) ** Root canal treatment *** Pulpotomy -- the opening of the pulp chamber of the tooth to allow an infection to drain; usually a precursor to a root canal *** Pulpectomy -- the removal of the pulp from the pulp chamber to temporarily relieve pain; usually a precursor to a root canal ** Apicoectomy -- a root-end resection. Occasionally a root canal alone is be enough to relieve pain and the end of the tooth, called the apex, is removed by entering through the gingiva and surgically extracting the diseased material. * Prosthodontics (dental prosthetics) ** Crown (caps) -- artificial covering of a tooth made from a variety of biocompatible materials, including CMC/PMC (ceramic/porcelain metal composite), gold or a tin/aluminum mixture. The underlying tooth must be reshaped to accommodate these fixed restorations ** Veneers -- artificial coverings similar to above, except that they only cover the forward (labial or buccal) surface of the tooth. Usually for aesthetic purposes only. ** Bridge -- a fixed prothesis in which two or more crowns are connected together, which replace a missing tooth or teeth through a bridge. Typically used after an extraction. ** Implant -- a procedure in which a titanium implant is surgically placed in the bone (mandible or maxilla), allowed to heal, and 4‚Äì6 months later an artificial tooth is connected to the implant by cement or retained by a screw. ** Dentures (false teeth) -- a partial or complete set of dentition which either attach to neighboring teeth by use of metal or plastic grasps or to the gingival or palatal surface by use of adhesive. ** Implant- supported prosthesis -- a combination of dentures and implants; bases are placed into the bone, allowed to heal, and metal appliances are fixed to the gingival surface, following which dentures are placed atop and fixed into place. * Orthodontic treatment ** Implants and implant-supported prosthesis -- also an orthodontic treatment as it involves bones * Apicoectomy -- also an orthodontic treatment as part of the underlying bone structure must be removed ** Extraction -- a procedure in which a diseased, redundant, or problematic tooth is removed, either by pulling or cutting out. This procedure can be done under local or general anesthesia and is very common -- many people have their wisdom teeth removed before they become problematic. **Fiberotomy -- a procedure to sever the fibers around a tooth, preventing it from relapsing *Periodontics *Oral and maxillofacial surgery Professional dental care Dental hygienist polishing a patient's teeth More frequent than usual cleaning and examination may be necessary during the treatment of many different dental/oral disorders or due to recent surgical procedures such as dental implants. The American Dental Association (ADA) stresses that the frequency of dental visits necessary is dependent upon the needs of each individual with some able to go once or twice a year and others needing to go more often. This may include yearly, select dental X-rays. See also dental plaque identification procedure and removal.  Dental instruments and restorative materials  Tooth capping Dental anesthesia Dentists inject anesthetic to block sensory transmission by the alveolar nerves. The superior alveolar nerves are not usually anesthetized directly because they are difficult to approach with a needle. For this reason, the maxillary teeth are usually anesthetized locally by inserting the needle beneath the oral mucosa surrounding the teeth. The inferior alveolar nerve is probably anesthetized more often than any other nerve in the body. To anesthetize this nerve, the dentist inserts the needle somewhat beyond the patient‚Äôs last molar.

The present-day site of RRH Staxton Wold has had an early warning function since the 3rd century AD, when it was the site of a warning beacon. It was first selected to be used as a radar station in 1937, when it was set up as part of the Chain Home system. Building work did not begin until December 1938 as delays in procuring the site occurred when the landowners resisted selling (this being before the Second World War, so the government found it harder to demand the land by force for the war effort). The site became fully operational in April 1939 and is the only one of the original stations still in use, and may thus claim to be the oldest continuously serving radar station. Today it is a Remote Radar Head (RRH) within the United Kingdom Air Surveillance and Control System (UKASACS). The radar at Staxton Wold is a Lockheed Martin TPS77 which was due to be working by September 2013, but only became fully operational in early 2015. In September 2017, it was reported that the AN/TPS-77 radar based at Staxton Wold would be transferred to RRH Saxa Vord.

It is celebrated on Gosthastami. The Durga Puja in Baripada is also very popular in BaripadaMaa Subhadra Rath of Baripada Rathyatra 2012 Tourist spots Simlipal National Park, Mayurbhanj =Khiching= Khiching is an ancient village under Sukruli block. Khiching is located about 50 km east of Keonjhargarh city 24 km west of Karanjia. The major festival in Khiching is Sivarathri, which is celebrated over seven days. The major tourist attraction of Khiching is the Maa Kichakeswari Temple. The temple was constructed during the year 920 925. Goddess Kichakeshwari was the ishtadevata and kuladevi of Bhanj dynasty as well as the deity of the Mayurbhanj princely state. The temple suffered in the hand of vandals. King of Mayurbhanj, Maharaja Pratap Chandra Bhanjdeo reconstructed the temple in the year 1934. Height of the temple is and total area is 1764 sq.ft. There is a museum constructed by Maharaja Purna Chandra Bhanjdeo in the year 1922. =Debakunda= Debakunda is a waterfall and tank. The Ambika temple is on the hilltop near the falls. Debakunda is at a distance of 60 km from Baripada and 85 km from Balasore. =Similipal= Similipal National Park is an elephant and tiger reserve 30 km from Baripada. It has an evergreen forest having varied flora and fauna, served with a network of perennial streams. This is a habitat for tropical birds and animals like elephants, tigers, leopards, sambar, and deer. The landscape comprises Sal forests, grasslands, peaks and waterfalls. Similipal is the richest watershed in Odisha, giving rise to many perennial rivers. The Budhabalanga, the Khadkei, the West Deo, the East Deo, the Salandi and the Sanjo are the major ones. Barehipani (400 m) and Joranda (150 m) waterfalls are visitor attractions, and the Ramtirtha Crocodile Rearing Centre is located in nearby Jashipur. =Baldiha Dam= Government neglect has taken its toll on century- old Baldiha Dam in Shamakhunta block of Mayurbhanj district. Built on river Palpala over 205 sqkm area, the irrigation project remains defunct for the last 20 years due to lack of renovation. The Project was undertaken during the rule of Maharaja Shri Ramchandra Bhanjdeo and the then State Engineer Jarnold Martin Loe had constructed the dam at Baldiha, from Baripada town. As of 2019, 10 to 15 acres of land are being irrigated during Rabi season with the water from the dam while there is no irrigation for Kharif crop. The water level of the dam has drastically come down due to huge deposition of soil and leakages. Even water from Palpala river has failed to recharge the dam during rainy season. =Bhimkund= There is a sacred pool near the river Vaitarani. As per legend Bhima, the second Pandava, took his bath in this pool when the Pandavas were passing their incognito life in Birat Nagar (presumed to be the present location of Kaptipada). The Vaitarani river flows through a gorge in steps and flows down to the Bhimkund pool. During the Makar festival during January, thousands of people gather here to take a holy dip. =Manatri= It is best known for the shrine of 'Kakharua Baidyanath' (Temple of Lord Shiva). It is surrounded on three sides by water channels from the Gangahar River. The temple is based on the Odisha's temple architecture. During the Shivaratri festival thousands of devotees gather there. According to legend, the king of Somavanshi dynasty was afflicted with leucoderma and his whole body resembled with white patches like in a water melon ('kakharu' in Oriya). It is believed that he was cured by the grace of the deity. Some Odia inscriptions of Mayurbhanj royal family are seen on the temple walls. To the west of temple in about 1 km are the remains of an ancient fort and 8 km to the east are the ruins of Kuradiha Gada. =Haripur= Haripur, earlier known as Hariharpur, was founded by Maharaja Harihar Bhanj in 1400 CE and remained as the capital of Bhanja Dynasty before it shifted to Baripada. Baidyanath Bhaanj, another ruler of the dynasty built a magnificent brick temple in honour of his tutelary God Rasika-raya. Though currently dilapidated, it is unique among the brick temples of Orissa. Towards the north to the courtyard of Rasikaraya temple lies the ruins of Ranihanspur (the inner apartment of the queen). Radhamohan temple is a brick-built rectangular temple nearby. =Lulung= This place is surrounded on three sides by hills of Similipal range. It is a popular place for picnicking, and tourists can purchase the stone utensils that are native to this place. =Devagram= Also known as Deogan, the river Sono flows close to the village. There are several ruins of old temples on the bank of the river. It is presumed that a change in the course of the river might have caused this destruction. The images of Ganesh and Parvati with Shiva Lingam and the eight-armed Chamunda on a heap of stone are found here. The sculpture of the Goddess and the pedestal are notable for their workmanship. Fragments of stone supposed to be parts of the ruins of Chamunda temple are still lying in the river bed. =Samibruksha= Samibruksha is a peak in the hillock and is about 500 ft high. There are five caves on the western side. Legend has it that the five Pandavas hid their arms in these caves before proceeding to the court of the king Virata. The pilgrims take their sacred bath in the nearby stream on Baruni day in the month of Chaitra. Makar Sankranti, which falls in mid-January, is the most important festival of this place. =Simla= Simla on the banks of river Burhabalanga is houses the shrine of Simileswar Shiva. Hundreds of pilgrims visit the shrine every day, and this place is famous with picnickers. A fair is held during the Shivaratri day which continues for a week. =Kuchei= This is an excavated prehistoric site and discoveries pertaining to Neolithic possessions of man are being made. The pottery fragments found with Neolithic implements speak of settlements in the late Stone Age in Mayurbhanj district. =Kuliana= Many paleolithic artifacts are being discovered in this region. Its very near to West Bengal's Medinipore. =Sitakund Waterfall= The Sitakund waterfall is one of the another outside attraction tourist place of Simlipal Tiger reserve of Odisha. The Sitakund waterfall is located at Mayurbhanj district of Odisha and it is the part of the Simlipal National Park. Also this place is the place of Hinduism because the name of the waterfall is Sitakund that is the name of Hindu goddess Sita Devi. Transportation Baripada railway station was one of the earliest stations in Odisha. The ruler of Mayurbhanj, Maharaja Krushna Chandra Bhanjdeo, connected Baripada to the Howrah-Chennai railway corridor by a narrow-gauge rail network, then known as the Mayurbhanj State Railway. The first ever airport during the British Raj in Odisha stands to this date at sites of Rajabasa (16 km from city) and Rasgovindpur (60 km from the city) with their 2 km-long runways which were constructed during World War II. Now a broad gauge railway line has replaced it which has benefited over 150,000 of this city's population. As of now, a Baripada ‚Äî Rupsa ‚Äî Balasore DEMU Pgr. train and a superfast express train to the state capital Bhubaneswar runs on daily basis. There's also a weekly train that runs from Baripada to Puri directly. A new train to Kolkata from Baripada has been running since 2010. Regarding road transport, luxury A/C buses are a popular means of transportation between the cities. There is connectivity to Bhubaneswar, Puri, Sambalpur, Jharsuguda, Rourkela, Keonjhar, Balasore, Angul, Bolangir, Bhadrak, Cuttack, Jamshedpur, Kharagpur, Ranchi and Kolkata from here. The city is 30 km from the starting point of N.H. 5 (now N.H. 18) which goes to Chennai. There are a wide range of taxis for sightseeing and tours. Education Baripada is the seat for North Orissa University at Takatpur. It is home to the Maharaja Purna Chandra Junior College which provides higher secondary education in Humanities, Science, and Commerce stream to more than 2000 students. It is also home to the MPC Autonomous College which provides graduate, and postgraduate level academics in various disciplines. The erstwhile Mayurbhanj Palace houses the Maharaja Purna Chandra Junior College with and Government Women's College with about 500 students. The newly built Pandit Raghunath Murmu Medical College and Hospital started its classes from September 2017. It is located in Rangmatia, 8 km from the main town. The oldest high school is M.K.C High School, built during 1889. The town has two Kendriya Vidyalaya schools. There are English medium schools, viz ‚Äî St. Anne's Convent School, St. Mary's Convent School, Sacred Sunshine Secondary School, Sri Satya Sai Vidya Vihar, etc. The other schools are Maharishi Public School, Sarat Chandra Vidyapitha, Policeline High School, Bhanjpur High School, Bhanjpur Girls' High School, Rakhal Gope High School, Rakhal Gope Nodal School. One of the other schools include Maharani Premakumari Girls High school at Lalbazar for girls' secondary education. The engineering college named Seemanta Engineering College, affiliated to BPUT is near Jharpokharia which is 35 km from Baripada. Mayurbhanj Law College (established in 1978), B.Ed College, Ayurvedic College and Homeopathy colleges are in Baripada.

It is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis. Infections normally affect ruminants (mammals that have four compartments of their stomachs, of which the rumen is one), but have also been seen in a variety of nonruminant species, including rabbits, foxes, and birds. Horses, dogs, and nonhuman primates have been infected experimentally. Paratuberculosis is found worldwide, with some states in Australia (where it is usually called bovine Johne's disease or BJD) being the only areas proven to be free of the disease.Collins M. and Manning E. \\"Johne's Information Center\\" The University of Wisconsin-School of Veterinary Medicine. 13 March 2003. At least in Canada, the signs of BJD usually start when cattle are four to seven years of age, and then usually only are diagnosed in one animal at a time. Cattle \\"with signs of Johne‚Äôs disease shed billions of bacteria through their manure and serve as a major source of infection for future calves.\\" Some sources define \\"paratuberculosis\\" by the lack of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rather than the presence of any specific infectious agent, leaving ambiguous the appropriateness of the term to describe Buruli ulcer or Lady Windermere syndrome. Bacterium The disease, discovered by Heinrich A. Johne, a German bacteriologist and veterinarian, in 1905, is caused by a bacterium named Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, an acid-fast bacillus, often abbreviated MAP. MAP is akin to, but distinct from, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the main cause of tuberculosis in humans, and Mycobacterium bovis, the main cause of tuberculosis in cattle and occasionally also in humans. MAP is 99% genetically related to Mycobacterium avium, but has different phenotypic characteristics, such as: * slower growth * requires the addition of an iron transport chemical known as mycobactin when grown in vitro * forms a rough colony when grown on a solid agar medium * Infects mammals instead of birds Also, the environmental distribution of MAP is markedly different from that of M. avium, which can produce mycobactin, so can grow and multiply outside the body.  Signs and symptoms  In cattle, the main signs of paratuberculosis are diarrhea and wasting. Most cases are seen in 2- to 6-year-old animals. The initial signs can be subtle, and may be limited to weight loss, decreased milk production, or roughening of the hair coat. The diarrhea is usually thick, without blood, mucus, or epithelial debris, and may be intermittent. Several weeks after the onset of diarrhea, a soft swelling may occur under the jaw. Known as \\"bottle jaw\\" or intermandibular edema, this symptom is due to protein loss from the bloodstream into the digestive tract. Paratuberculosis is progressive; affected animals become increasingly emaciated and usually die as the result of dehydration and severe cachexia. Signs are rarely evident until two or more years after the initial infection, which usually occurs shortly after birth. Animals are most susceptible to the infection in the first year of life. Newborns most often become infected by swallowing small amounts of infected manure from the birthing environment or udder of the mother. In addition, newborns may become infected while in the uterus or by swallowing bacteria passed in milk and colostrum. Animals exposed at an older age, or exposed to a very small dose of bacteria at a young age, are not likely to develop clinical disease until they are much older than two years. The clinical signs are similar in other ruminants. In sheep and goats, the wool or hair is often damaged and easily shed, and diarrhea is uncommon. In deer, paratuberculosis can progress rapidly. Intestinal disease has also been reported in rabbits and nonhuman primates. Unlike cattle and sheep, infections in deer often present with clinical illness in animals under one year of age. Pathophysiology The primary site targeted by Johne's disease is the lower part of the intestine known as the ileum. The wall of the ileum contains a large number of pockets of lymphoid tissue known as Peyer's patches that lie just beneath the interior surface of the intestine. Peyer's patches are clusters of macrophages and lymphocytes organized much like lymph nodes. Covering Peyer's patches are a layer of cells called M cells. These cells function to sample the content of the lumen of the intestines and pass antigens (bacteria) through to the underlying cells of the Peyer's patch to \\"show\\" these antigens to the macrophages and lymphocytes. This is a means of \\"educating\\" the cells in a young animal about its environment, and is a protective mechanism designed to help the animal become immune to pathogens in its environment. Unfortunately, when M cells bring M. paratuberculosis to the Peyer's patch, the bacteria find an ideal place for growth. Macrophages in Peyer's patches engulf M. paratuberculosis for the purpose of destroying the foreign invader, but for reasons yet unclear, these macrophages fail to do this. Inside a macrophage, M. paratuberculosis multiplies until it eventually kills the cell, spreads, and infects other nearby cells. In time, other parts of the ileum and other regions of the body are teeming with millions of the mycobacteria. How M. paratuberculosis neutralizes or evades the normally efficient bacterial killing mechanisms of the macrophages is unknown, although the unusually resistant cell wall of mycobacteria likely plays an important role. The animal's immune system reacts to the M. paratuberculosis invasion by recruiting more macrophages and lymphocytes to the site of the infection. The lymphocytes release a variety of chemicals signals, called cytokines, in an attempt to increase the bacterial killing power of the macrophages. Macrophages fuse together, forming large cells, called multinucleated giant cells, in an apparent attempt to kill the mycobacteria. Infiltration of infected tissues with millions of lymphocytes and macrophages leads to visible thickening of the intestines. This prevents nutrient absorption, and diarrhea results. Late in the infection, antibody production by the animal occurs to M. paratuberculosis in serum of animals, and is an indicator that clinical signs of disease and death from the infection will soon follow. For goats infected with this disease, the most apparent sign of having it is their bodies wasting away, even with a sufficient diet. If a goat develops Johne's and it has diarrhea, it is most likely going to die. When it has diarrhea, the goat is at the last stages of the disease. Herds should be tested once or twice a year to maintain the health and keep out the disease. Morbidity and mortality In an endemic herd, only a minority of the animals develops clinical signs; most animals either eliminate the infection or become asymptomatic carriers. The mortality rate is about 1%, but up to 50% of the animals in the herd can be asymptomatically infected, resulting in losses in production. Once the symptoms appear, paratuberculosis is progressive and affected animals eventually die. The percentage of asymptomatic carriers that develop overt disease is unknown.Paratuberculosis. In the Merck Veterinary Manual, 8th ed. Edited by S. E. Aiello. Whitehouse Station, NJ: Merck and Co. 1998.  Human risks  MAP is capable of causing Johne's-like symptoms in humans, though difficulty in testing for MAP infection presents a diagnostic hurdle.Richter, E., Wessling, J., L√ºgering, N., Domschke, W., & R√ºsch-Gerdes, S. (2002). Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis Infection in a Patient with HIV, Germany. Emerging Infectious Diseases, 8(7), 729‚Äì731. http://doi.org/10.3201/eid0807.010388 As of October 2019, neither the World Health Organization nor any individual nation had declared Johne‚Äôs disease to be zoonotic. Clinical similarities are seen between Johne's disease in ruminants and inflammatory bowel disease in humans, and because of this, some researchers contend the organism is a cause of Crohn's disease.Gitlin L, Borody TJ, Chamberlin W, Campbell J. Mycobacterium avium ss paratuberculosis- associated diseases: piecing the Crohn's puzzle together. J Clin Gastroenterol. 2012 Sep;46(8) 649-55. However, epidemiologic studies have provided variable results; in certain studies, the organism (or an immune response directed against it) has been much more frequently found in patients with Crohn's disease than asymptomatic people. Action and regulations Paratuberculosis is a reportable disease in some states of the US.United States Department of Agriculture, \\"National Animal Health Reporting System - Reportable Diseases\\" US Federal regulations prohibit culture positive or DNA test-positive animals from being moved across state lines except for slaughter. Dr Cheryl Waldner obtained in February 2020 a five-year CAD 2.35 million fund to research beef cattle health and productivity, one aspect of which is the control of \\"production-limiting\\" diseases such as Johne's disease.

The headless lion is the family shield of Frans Loenen. Jacobus Zaffius sponsored an additional 5 rooms. The Frans Loenenhofje is a hofje in Haarlem, Netherlands, on the Witte Heren straat. It was named the \\"Five room\\" or Vijfkamer hofje in 1607 after the five new rooms that were built from the proceeds of the will and testament of Frans Loenen (1543‚Äì1605). Frans Loenen was a Catholic who fled to Haarlem from Amsterdam in 1578 for their milder disposition toward people of the Old Catholic faith. He left all of his goods to the poor in an extraordinary will drawn up 3 days before he died. His friends gave up trying to sort out his legacy, because most of his property was still located in the Spanish Netherlands, then enemy territory, and some of his money was tied up in outstanding bets. For example, he had bet a small fortune of 16,000 guilders that the siege of Sluis would not last two years. It was decided that a hofje would be the best option, in case any of the bets paid out, which they did. The garden of this hofje used to be part of a famed garden from the St Anthony's monastery, which was founded in 1414. The St. Anthony order was later associated with the Vrouwe- en Antonie Gasthuys and the monastery was inhabited by Norbertine monks in 1484. The Norbertines who tended the garden wore white scapulars. Thus the name of the street; \\"White gentlemen street\\". They remained there until 1543, when the monastery lands came under the control of the St. Elisabeth Gasthuis. Their lands were officially confiscated and secularized in 1581 by the city council after the Protestant Reformation, just as all other Catholic buildings and lands in Haarlem after the iconoclasm. For some reason the actual moment of transferral of the deeds only took place fifteen years later in 1596, and the Catholic associations with this property was probably the reason it was selected by the executors of the Frans Loenen will. Two years later, in 1607, the provost Jacobus Zaffius sponsored an additional 5 rooms, thereafter known as the \\"provost rooms\\" of the Frans Loenen Hofje. Jacobus Zaffius had been abbot in the St. Anthony's monastery in Heiloo from 1578 to 1571, when he became provost of the Sint-Bavokerk. He witnessed the iconoclasm and 3 years later went to jail for refusal to turn over Catholic property to the city council. William of Orange granted him amnesty, and it was on this occasion that he made his donation to the hofje and in 1611 he had his painting made as a memorial to this fact. The hofje currently has 10 rooms for women, who must have a minimum age of 60 years and who must have lived in Haarlem for five years or longer.

Tchebychev. Sur la fonction qui d√©termine la totalit√© des nombres premiers. M√©moires pr√©sent√©s √† l'Acad√©mie Imp√©riale des Sciences de St- P√©tersbourg par divers savants, VI 1851, 141‚Äì157 Note that, already in 1737, Euler knew the asymptotic behaviour of this sum. Mertens diplomatically describes his proof as more precise and rigorous. In reality none of the previous proofs are acceptable by modern standards: Euler's computations involve the infinity (and the hyperbolic logarithm of infinity, and the logarithm of the logarithm of infinity!); Legendre's argument is heuristic; and Chebyshev's proof, although perfectly sound, makes use of the Legendre- Gauss conjecture, which was not proved until 1896 and became better known as the prime number theorem. Mertens' proof does not appeal to any unproved hypothesis (in 1874), and only to elementary real analysis. It comes 22 years before the first proof of the prime number theorem which, by contrast, relies on a careful analysis of the behavior of the Riemann zeta function as a function of a complex variable. Mertens' proof is in that respect remarkable. Indeed, with modern notation it yields :\\\\sum_{p\\\\le x}\\\\frac1p=\\\\log\\\\log x+M+O(1/\\\\log x) whereas the prime number theorem (in its simplest form, without error estimate), can be shown to be equivalent toAlthough this equivalence is not explicitly mentioned there,it can for instance be easily derived from the material in chapter I.3 of: G. Tenenbaum. Introduction to analytic and probabilistic number theory. Translated from the second French edition (1995) by C. B. Thomas. Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics, 46. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge,1995. :\\\\sum_{p\\\\le x}\\\\frac1p=\\\\log\\\\log x+M+o(1/\\\\log x).

A simple summation by parts exploiting the strongest form known of the prime number theorem improves this to :\\\\sum_{p\\\\le x}\\\\frac1p=\\\\log\\\\log x+M+O(e^{-c(\\\\log x)^{3/5}(\\\\log\\\\log x)^{-1/5}}) for some c > 0. = Mertens' third theorem and sieve theory = An estimate of the probability of X (X \\\\gg n) having no factor \\\\le n is given by :\\\\prod_{p\\\\le n}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac1p\\\\right) This is closely related to Mertens' third theorem which gives an asymptotic approximation of :P(p \\\\mid X \\\\exists p \\\\le n) = \\\\frac{1}{e^\\\\gamma \\\\ln n }  In summability theory  In summability theory, Mertens' theorem states that if a real or complex infinite series :\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n converges to A and another :\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty b_n converges absolutely to B then their Cauchy product converges to AB.

It began as Private Eye. City Weekly is published and dated for every Thursday by Copperfield Publishing Inc. of which John Saltas is majority owner and president. History John Saltas founded what would become Salt Lake City Weekly in June 1984. He called his monthly publication Private Eye because it contained news and promotions for bars and dance clubs, which due to Utah State liquor laws were all private clubs. Saltas originally mailed the Private Eye as a newsletter to private club members. State law forbade private clubs from advertising at the time, so Saltas' newsletter was the only way for clubs to provide promotional information. In 1988 Private Eye became a bi-weekly newspaper although it was available mostly in clubs. Distribution of the paper broadened as new liquor rule interpretations at the Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (DABC) allowed mainstream media to carry club advertisements as long as they weren't \\"soliciting\\" members. Private Eye thus ended its mailed period and was available for free in public distribution outlets for the first time. In 1989, Private Eye was admitted to the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies (AAN), the organization's 40th member. =Private Eye Weekly= In 1992 Private Eye Weekly emerged as a weekly tabloid-style alternative paper with distribution outlets in Salt Lake City, Ogden, Park City and Utah County. Saltas hired his first editor, then-KSL-TV journalist Tom Walsh, a veteran writer with experience from the alternative Phoenix New Times, who took a significant salary cut because of his enthusiasm for the new paper. Early contributors to Private Eye included Ben Fulton (who served as editor-in-chief until spring 2007), Christopher Smart (currently a reporter for The Salt Lake Tribune), Mary Dickson, Katharine Biele, Lynn Packer, and notable Utah defense attorney Ron Yengich. From 1992 onward, reporter Lynn Packer scooped many stories about then-Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini, and Bonneville Pacific, an energy company.\\"Private Eye Weekly continues to live up to the expectations of an alternative publication with stories and viewpoints that mainstream media do not carry. The publication has relentlessly kept on top of Bonneville Pacific developments, thanks to the tenacity of free-lance writer Lynn Packer and the commitment of publisher John Saltas and managing editor Tom Walsh.\\" - Ron Yengich's relationship with the paper would end days after he was retained as Corradini's attorney in 1996. Yengich had mocked the mayor in a Private Eye column just days before becoming her representative.His column was titled \\"Ben (Franklin) and Deedee\\". Tom Walsh left the paper in June 1996 to become executive of another alternative weekly, the Miami New Times. Private Eye hosted the annual AAN convention on May 29‚Äì31, 1996, after Walsh had announced his resignation. During 1996, the newspaper's page count outgrew the capacity of independent Salt Lake City presses, so the paper made printing arrangements with the publisher of the Ogden Standard-Examiner. Content for City Weekly is sent via computer to the press in Ogden, Utah, and bundles of printed papers are trucked south to Salt Lake City for distribution. The paper also began posting all content online in 1996, originally using the URL www.avenews.com. City Weekly is currently available at www.cityweekly.net, and starting in 2005 began posting additional information on a sister-commerce site, cwlistings.com. In the early 1990s the paper began giving out yearly awards based on reader votes and staff input. The categories and pages devoted to the \\"Best of Utah\\" issues expanded over time, and these issues are typically the year's largest. Many establishments proudly display City Weekly \\"Best of...\\" awards, and often have several years' worth mounted above the cash register. In 1996 the paper began recognizing local music in the \\"SLAMMY awards\\" (Salt Lake Area Music & More). As with the \\"Best of Utah\\" issues, locals are encouraged to vote for their favorite local bands and albums in different categories. The paper also hosts a party featuring several of the winners. =Salt Lake City Weekly= In 1997 the growing paper changed its name to Salt Lake City Weekly, abbreviated to City Weekly on the masthead. Many people misunderstood the paper's original name, assuming that the Private Eye was a detective agency. The paper published stories of the 2002 Winter Olympics bribery scandal. Discoveries that International Olympic Committee members apparently accepted gifts in return for votes to select Salt Lake City as the Olympic host erupted into an internationally significant story in 1999 and 2000. During the late 1990s, a suit to allow club and liquor advertising began making its way through local courts. City Weekly had tried and failed to persuade the state's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to lift Utah's peculiar restrictions on liquor advertising. National media like Wall Street Journal and USA Today were published without constraints on their advertising. The case dragged on for years in Utah District Court before Judge David Sam, who rejected the claim that advertising liquor in Utah was bound by national precedent.Relevant Supreme Court precedent cited by both the plaintiffs and the Tenth Circuit was 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. State of Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484 (1996), which found that restriction on advertising the price of alcohol interfered with free speech rights incorporated in the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this ruling on July 24, 2001, when the court remanded plaintiff's request for appeal on the district court's ruling to deny preliminary injunction.Utah Licensed Bev. Ass'n v. Leavitt, 256 F.3d 1061 (2001) The Tenth Circuit stated that the plaintiffs satisfied requirements for an injunction, forcing the state to allow liquor advertising. In August the Utah Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission began drafting amendments to legalize liquor advertising in print, in restaurants, and on billboards. The LDS Church thought that the Commission's proposed changes went too far and urged retention of the old rules. Saltas chided the Church in an editorial, but offered them a free full- page ad so they could explain their position against liquor advertising. The Church had not previously advertised in the paper, which was often considered anti-Mormon, but they accepted Saltas' offer. On November 29, 2001, City Weekly published the LDS statement. The same issue carried the paper's first liquor ad, for Jim Beam. Saltas told the Tribune that the timing was \\"just an ironic coincidence.\\" In October 2002, editor Christopher Smart left City Weekly for a reporting position with The Salt Lake Tribune. Saltas named John Yewell as editor; his tenure lasted nine months. Associate editor Ben Fulton was named editor pro-tem, and later was given the post. Fulton ran the paper until April 2007, garnering several awards, including a Hearst Award for long- form journalism, as well as several first-place awards from the Utah Chapter Society of Professional Journalists and the Utah Press Association. As the paper gained popularity and staff, the load on John Saltas decreased. In 2003 he stepped aside as publisher, naming Jim Rizzi, who had been hired in 2002 as a vice-president, as his successor. After being uninvolved with the paper's operations for several months, Saltas was asked to contribute a weekly column. Saltas now writes a light-hearted, somewhat blog-like column called \\"Private Eye\\", discussing his favorite Utah Jazz players, his Greek heritage, and jokes that he would soon be fired. In April 2007 Holly Mullen was announced as the paper's new editor. She had been an area journalist for nine years, most recently (until January 2007) as a columnist for The Salt Lake Tribune. In addition to her renown as a liberal reporter and writer, she is now noted as the wife of former Salt Lake City Mayor Ted Wilson. On February 26, 2009, Mullen informed her friends through her Facebook profile that she had parted ways with the paper. At the same time, longtime City Weekly Managing Editor Jerre Wroble was promoted to the Editor position; she left the paper in 2013, replaced in 2014 by Rachel Piper. She returned to guide the paper for a year (January 2015-5 May 2016) when Piper departed.City Weekly \\"Staff\\", 5 May 2016 Salt Lake City Weekly is currently available at over 2,000 locations, including sites outside the Salt Lake Valley (such as the Tooele Valley). The paper is found online at www.cityweekly.net. The 55,000 weekly Circulation for City Weekly is independently audited by Verified Audit and has been so for nearly 20 years. In 2009, the Utah SPJ awarded Salt Lake City Weekly 13 journalism awards: *Stephen Dark, a senior staff-writer won Best Newspaper Reporter. The judges wrote, \\"by far Dark had the most diverse and interesting subject matter. His ability to tell a story in a clean and compelling manner also stood out.\\" Dark won in the Military Reporting category for \\"Diary of a Suicide\\" and in Religion/Values Reporting for \\"Swap Meet.\\" *Scott Renshaw, the Arts and Entertainment Editor received 2nd place in Review/Criticism for the article, \\"Romancing the Stoned\\" and 2nd place for Headline Writing. *Eric S.

The judges wrote, \\"Peterson did an excellent job of raising questions about the necessity for steep state tax breaks for oil companies at a time when they were earning record profits. He attempted to independently calculate the cost to taxpayers, who he pointed out are paying more at the pump in Utah than residents of other states without such a big industry presence. He was also fair, offering significant commentary from oil executives who say they need breaks to counter the costly process of production. With both sides, Peterson facilitated an intellectual debate with no easy answers.\\" *Eric Peterson won 1st place in the Government Reporting category for the article, \\"Drug Deal.\\" The judges wrote \\"Peterson offers a comprehensive analysis of a no-bid contract and the influences that contributed to the deal-making process.

Apart from covering scandals about former Democratic Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini, the paper controversially editorialized against her and her associates. The paper often listed her actions as \\"misses\\" in the \\"Hits & Misses\\" column on the opinion page. City Weekly attacks on district attorney Neal Gunnarson so upset him that he stole hundreds of copies of the paper from the racks in 1997. Technically, this is theft because only the first copy of each publication is free; additional copies are one dollar each. An article appearing in the issue posited that Gunnarson was being too soft on Mayor Corradini, claiming that his weak prosecution didn't \\"pass the smell test.\\" During the 1999 mayoral elections, the scandal-ridden Corradini declined to seek re-election. City Weekly endorsed Rocky Anderson in a crowded primary. Anderson had been retained by the paper as an attorney on occasion. Facing Stuart Reid, a member of Corradini's administration, Anderson won, but the paper remained neutral during his 2003 re-election. However, during Anderson's second term, he was visiting another city and crossed a police picket line in order to attend a scheduled meeting. He later remarked to a reporter that the line was not a picket line, but a demonstration, so there was no harm in crossing. This did not sit well with John Saltas, who viewed it as a repudiation of a useful labor negotiating tactic, and since that time Saltas has made several critical comments toward the Mayor in his columns. In 2004, City Weekly published a series of articles criticizing embattled Salt Lake County mayor Nancy Workman. Workman was acquitted of criminal charges for misuse of County funds, but was forced out as a candidate by vote of the Salt Lake County Republican Party Central Committee. The Central Committee then proceeded to nominate and accept by acclamation candidate and developer Ellis Ivory. In the ensuing election Ivory was defeated by Democrat Peter Corroon. Relationships to other Salt Lake papers City Weekly comments extensively on local media through a \\"media beat\\" column and letters from the editor. In 2006 the major newspapers (through their joint publishing arm, MediaOne, formerly the Newspaper Agency Corporation) launched In Utah This Week, a free weekly events-oriented newspaper. Throughout the alternative newspaper industry, such publications produced by a city daily are referred to as Fake Alts, or FauxAlts. In Utah This Week ceased publication a few years later. Saltas has mocked the Tribune's byline \\"Utah's Independent Voice\\" by calling the paper \\"Utah's co-dependent voice.\\" The paper, he points out, is published with the same MediaOne facilities as the two paper's joint operating agreement. Thus City Weekly casts the paper as being \\"less independent than it pretends to be.\\" The 2002 Tribune acquisition by Dean Singleton, owner of the nation's 7th largest newspaper chain, prompted an expos√©. City Weekly asserted that increased cooperation and expansion of the two daily papers under Singleton's Tribune leadership hurt surrounding papers' viability. The Tribune has hired two former reporters of the City Weekly, while City Weekly has hired several former Tribune reporters over the same time span, with moves in both directions affirming the legitimacy of news reporting in City Weekly. After emerging from bankruptcy in 2010, MediaNews Group lost control of the Tribune to a hedge fund, Alden Global Capital. As of May 2016, sale of The Tribune to a local businessman is being negotiated.\\"Billionaire Saves Paper\\", Salt Lake City Weekly, 15 May 2016 issue, p. 15 Current features City Weekly tends to be geared toward a younger, more urban, and more liberal audience than the area's other papers. Its features include its reviews of art films (Scott Renshaw), restaurants (Ted Scheffler), local music groups, scheduled art shows and events, and television (Bill Frost). Founder Saltas writes a stream-of- thought column called \\"Private Eye.\\" Katharine Biele writes an opinion-briefs feature called \\"Hits & Misses\\". Until 2014 the paper had a satire column called \\"Deep End\\" written by D.P. Sorensen who, among other things, jokingly claimed to have been Mitt Romney's missionary companion. It also carries syndicated columns \\"News Quirks\\" by Roland Sweet, and the Straight Dope, by Chicago-based Cecil Adams, Free Will Astrology and comics such as Tom Tomorrow's This Modern World, and Keith Knight's K Chronicles. The paper has also expanded its online content in recent years, including featured blogs from Gavin Sheehan. City Weekly publishes a number of special issues each year, including the Best of Utah guide and the City Weekly Music Awards (formerly SLAMMys) issue (see also Music of Utah).

History of the complex A regent of the hofje posing next to his portrait in the regent's room of the Hofje van Noblet. Gate of the Hofje van Staats in 1925 Gate of the Wildemanshofje in Alkmaar, that the architect Kleijn visited before building the Hofje van Staats. It was built from July 29, 1730 to 1733 from the legacy of the Haarlem thread-seller Ysbrand Staats. He left his entire legacy to the poor, and his brother took charge of building this hofje after he died. The first hofje to be built in the 18th century, the executors visited Alkmaar under the leadership of architect Abraham Kleijn, to visit the \\"new style hofje\\" Wildemans. In former times hofjes were built in the back gardens of larger homes of the wealthy donors. In 1730 the new style hofjes were luxurious complexes with fancy gateway buildings directly on the street. The original gateway house of this hofje still stands, but no longer functions as the home of a governing regent, but as a storefront. It is certainly grander than the Wildeman's hofje, but was itself surpassed as the fanciest hofje in Haarlem by the Teylers Hofje. Residents The hofje was designed to be grand, because it was meant for women of the Dutch Reformed faith, at that time the official faith of the Haarlem council. According to the original hofje rules and regulations, the women eligible to live there were not very poor, because they had to buy their place for 50 florins and bring a long list of possessions with them, including clothing and furnishings. It originally had houses for 29 single elder women, after the renovation in 1990 this was reduced to 20. Finances The hofje was quite wealthy, and in 1783 celebrated its 50-year jubilee with a glass for the regents engraved with the portrait of Ysbrand Staats. According to the period history of Haarlem by Pieter Langendijk, the hofje had bleaching fields behind the easternmost cottages and a pavilion on the Spaarne river for the ladies to drink tea in. During the French occupation the finances took a turn for the worse and that land was sold. An original drawing of the complete hofje complex from the Jansweg to the Spaarne hangs in the Hofje van Noblet, whose finances are also managed by the same \\"Foundation for the preservation of the Hofjes Staats and Noblet\\".

In the background looms the modern housing of the Haarlem library Pump in the garden that is decorated with a Baroque heraldic shield showing the three crowns that signify the St. Elisabeth of Groote Gasthuis. The Hofje van Loo is a hofje on the Barrevoetstraat 7 in Haarlem, Netherlands. It was founded in 1489 by Haarlem mayor Symon Pieterszoon van Loo and his wife Godelt Willemsdochter, on the Grebbesteeg 'purely to honor and rest the souls of their parents and themselves' by funding 13 rooms with gardens to be administered by the 'gasthuismeesters' of the St. Elisabeth Gasthuis nearby. There were many conditions attached to this deal, among them the stipulation that the rooms remain on the Grebbesteeg behind the van Loo house, which was on the Barrevoetsteeg. The gasthuismeesters should give each member each week one stuiver (5 cents), one or two baskets of turf (used instead of firewood for cooking and heating). Aside from this, a parcel of land in Castricum was donated to be used for income, and the rooms, land, and rent, should all be administered separately. Despite this last stipulation, the land in Castricum was sold in 1633, and in 1683 the books were merged with the St. Elisabeth Gasthuis. The original houses in the hofje are gone, replaced in the 17th century, and renovated in the 18th. In 1843 the regents room (which was never used) was renovated and split into two houses, so that 15 members could be housed in total. In 1884 the hofje almost disappeared altogether, when the Barrevoetsteeg was widened to become the Barrevoetstraat. One whole side of the hofje needed to be demolished, and therefore plans were made to move the entire hofje elsewhere. In 1885 the Haarlem council decided to move only the Oud-Alkemade hofje which was also located on the Barrevoetsteeg, and only tear down the three houses on the street side of the van Loo hofje. Three new houses were built further back from the street (these are the two buildings to the left and right of the gate), and the old regents room was declared the gatekeepers cottage, bringing the total number of rooms to 14. The role of the gatekeeper as recorded by the St. Elisabeth's regents in 1835 had a yearly salary of 11 guilders and her duties were to open and close the gate, turn the streetlight on and off, clean the privy, and send for medicine for sick members. Today one of the members is appointed as general contact for the regents. This hofje is the most visible from the street of all the hofjes in Haarlem. The front-row of three houses was demolished in 1880 when the street in front of it, the Barrevoetesteeg, was widened. So instead of the typical U-shape of houses around a garden, one side of the hofje is now located at the street, separated only by a fence.

He then studied comparative linguistics, gaining a good command of Sanskrit. He wrote his doctoral thesis on the role of the jester in Indian drama in 1897. It was not until 1902 that his interest turned towards medieval and Renaissance history. He continued teaching as an Orientalist until he became a Professor of General and Dutch History at Groningen University in 1905. In 1915, he was made Professor of General History at Leiden University, a post he held until 1942. In 1916 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1942, he spoke critically of his country's German occupiers, comments that were consistent with his writings about Fascism in the 1930s. He was held in detention by the Nazis between August and October 1942. Upon his release, he was banned from returning to Leiden. He subsequently lived at the house of his colleague Rudolph Cleveringa in De Steeg in Gelderland, near Arnhem, where he died just a few weeks before Nazi rule ended. He lies buried in the graveyard of the Reformed Church at 6 Haarlemmerstraatweg in Oegstgeest.Van Ditzhuijzen, Jeannette (September 9, 2005). Bijna vergeten waren ze, de rustplaatsen van roemruchte voorvaderen. Trouw (Dutch newspaper), p. 9 of supplement. Works Huizinga had an aesthetic approach to history, where art and spectacle played an important part. His most famous work is The Autumn of the Middle Ages (a.k.a. The Waning of the Middle Ages and as Autumntide of the Middle Ages) (1919). Worthy of mentioning are also Erasmus (1924) and Homo Ludens (1938). In the latter book he discussed the possibility that play is the primary formative element in human culture. Huizinga also published books on American history and Dutch history in the 17th century. Alarmed by the rise of National Socialism in Germany, Huizinga wrote several works of cultural criticism. Many similarities can be noted between his analysis and that of contemporary critics such as Ortega y Gasset and Oswald Spengler. Huizinga argued that the spirit of technical and mechanical organisation had replaced spontaneous and organic order in cultural as well as political life. The Huizinga Lecture (Dutch: Huizingalezing) is a prestigious annual lecture in the Netherlands about a subject in the domains of cultural history or philosophy in honour of Johan Huizinga. Family Huizinga's son Leonhard Huizinga became a well- known writer in the Netherlands, especially renowned for his series of tongue- in-cheek novels on the Dutch aristocratic twins (\\"Adriaan en Olivier\\").

The Teylershofje is a hofje in Haarlem, Netherlands with 24 houses. History of the foundation Teylers Hofje, as seen from inside the main gate during the spring. Imposing gate overlooking the Spaarne river. The hofje currently known as the Vrouwe- en Antonie Gasthuis on the Klein Heiligland behind the Frans Hals Museum, was originally built by Pieter Joosten Boogaert as a Mennonite hofje in ca. 1620. Teyler bought it several generations later in 1752 from the Mennonite Coymans. The current hofje was built in 1787 from the legacy of Pieter Teyler van der Hulst, just like the Teylers Museum close to it. Pieter Teyler van der Hulst founded a hofje when his wife died in 1752 and he then purchased the Kolder hofje. That hofje was considerably renovated during his lifetime, but he found it still needed improvements for the residents. In his will he stipulated that a new hofje should be built in his name and the old hofje premises sold (and the premises were then sold to the oldest surviving hofje foundation in Haarlem, the 'Vrouwe- en Antonie Gasthuys'). The \\"new\\" hofje is by far the most impressive and imposing hofje in Haarlem. Stylish location In Teylers's day, most visitors to the city of Haarlem from Amsterdam would travel by trekschuit along the 'Stadsbuiten' canal (now the Papentorenvest street) joining the Spaarne just north of this hofje. The first building they would see across the Spaarne was the immense classical building of the Catholic Diocese (now the Police station). Next they would pass the location of this hofje, and further around the bend, the Damstraat, where Teyler's house is located. His museum, which is located in the back garden of his house, competed with the Dutch Society of Science for scientific research. Mennonites vs Catholics It would have been Teyler's express wish to have his hofje located on the Spaarne, in the same way that the executors of his will defining the Teyler's Museum chose later to build a new front entrance facing the Spaarne and leading visitors to the side entrance of the 'oval room'. The hall of the Diocese, which was used for meetings of the 'Economical branch of the Dutch Society for Science', would have impressed Teyler. It took several years to build the Catholic Diocese, from 1760 to 1772, and Pieter Teyler van der Hulst would have attended the meetings there as a member, but he could not become a board member due to his religion. He was a Mennonite. In order to get around this, he founded his own 'society of science', which later became the Teylers Museum. Ironically, both his museum and the Dutch Society of Science are now across from each other on the Spaarne and were merged in 1831. Architecture This hofje was built by the popular contemporary architect Leendert Viervant, who designed several other neo-classical objects in the 1780s in Haarlem. The hofje has a neo-classical facade and the doorway is flanked by Doric columns.

Formed around the talents of brothers Lars and Martin Horntveth, who also happen to be the main driving force behind the highly successful and unique Norwegian electronica/jazz/post-rock combo Jaga Jazzist, the band features musicians already well known in their native country, from such bands as Jaga Jazzist and BigBang, and singer-songwriter Thomas Dybdahl on vocals, the band is often referred to as a \\"supergroup\\" in Norway. on AllMusic.com VG.no (in Norwegian) Although closely connected to the band Jaga Jazzist, their music is completely different. The National Bank explore musical landscapes in more pop/rock oriented manners, with a focus on vocal- oriented orchestrated pop music suitable for the big stage. Their first single, Tolerate (2004), later released on the album The National Bank (2004), became an instant hit in Norway, and upon release was proclaimed by many Norwegian music critics to be the best Norwegian song of the year. Despite the grand success, all members continued their separate careers, yet there was talk of some work on writing and recording new material, and by 2007 all five members finally found the time to get together in the studio. The first new single, Let Go (2007), played on radio with an announcement that the second album, Come On Over To The Other Side, would be seen in the spring 2008 release. They did perform a number of successful shows around in Norway, but all the band members subsequently returned to their primary outfits. To support another massive success, The National Bank toured Norway, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands for the rest of the winter 2008/09.

Used either at a broadcast network, radio station or a television station, it can run a facility in the absence of a human operator. They can also run in a \\"live assist\\" mode when there are on- air personnel present at the master control, television studio or control room. The radio transmitter end of the airchain is handled by a separate automatic transmission system (ATS). History Originally, in the US, many (if not most) broadcast licensing authorities required a licensed board operator to run every station at all times, meaning that every DJ had to pass an exam to obtain a license to be on-air, if their duties also required them to ensure proper operation of the transmitter. This was often the case on overnight and weekend shifts when there was no broadcast engineer present, and all of the time for small stations with only a contract engineer on call. In the U.S., it was also necessary to have an operator on duty at all times in case the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) was used, as this had to be triggered manually. While there has not been a requirement to relay any other warnings, any mandatory messages from the U.S. president would have had to first be authenticated with a code word sealed in a pink envelope sent annually to stations by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Gradually, the quality and reliability of electronic equipment improved, regulations were relaxed, and no operator had to be present (or even available) while a station was operating. In the U.S., this came about when the EAS replaced the EBS, starting the movement toward automation to assist, and sometimes take the place of, the live disc jockeys (DJs) and radio personalities. Early analog systems Harris automation system used at the former WWJQ (now WPNW) in 1993. Early automation systems were electromechanical systems which used relays. Later systems were \\"computerized\\" only to the point of maintaining a schedule, and were limited to radio rather than TV. Music would be stored on reel-to-reel audio tape. Subaudible tones on the tape marked the end of each song. The computer would simply rotate among the tape players until the computer's internal clock matched that of a scheduled event. When a scheduled event would be encountered, the computer would finish the currently-playing song and then execute the scheduled block of events. These events were usually advertisements, but could also include the station's top-of-hour station identification, news, or a bumper promoting the station or its other shows. At the end of the block, the rotation among tapes resumed. Advertisements, jingles, and the top-of-hour station identification required by law were commonly stored on Fidelipac endless-loop tape cartridges, known colloquially as \\"carts\\". These were similar to the consumer four-track tapes sold under the Stereo-Pak brand, but had only two tracks and were usually recorded and played at 7.5 tape inches per second (in/s) compared to Stero-Pak's slower 3.75 in/s. The carts had a slot for a pinch roller on a spindle which was activated by solenoid upon pressing the start button on the cart machine. Because the capstan was already spinning at full speed, tape playback commenced without delay or any audible \\"run-up\\". Mechanical carousels would rotate the carts in and out of multiple tape players as dictated by the computer. Time announcements were provided by a pair of dedicated cart players, with the even minutes stored on one and the odd minutes on the other, meaning an announcement would always be ready to play even if the minute was changing when the announcement was triggered. The system did require attention throughout the day to change reels as they ran out and reload carts, and thus became obsolete when a method was developed to automatically rewind and re-cue the reel tapes when they ran out, extending 'walk-away' time indefinitely. Radio station WIRX may have been one of the world's first completely automated radio stations, built and designed by Brian Jeffrey Brown in 1963 when Brown was only 10 years old. The station broadcast in a classical format, called \\"More Good Music (MGM)\\" and featured five-minute bottom-of-the-hour news feeds from the Mutual Broadcasting System. The heart of the automation was an 8 x 24 telephone stepping relay which controlled two reel-to-reel tape decks, one twelve inch Ampex machine providing the main program audio and a second RCA seven inch machine providing \\"fill\\" music. The tapes played by these machines were originally produced in the Midwest Family Broadcasting (MWF) Madison, Wisconsin production facility by WSJM Chief Engineer Richard E. McLemore (and later in-house at WSJM) with sub-audible tones used to signal the end of a song. The stepping relay was programmed by slide switches in the front of the two relay racks which housed the equipment. The news feeds were triggered by a microswitch which was attached to a Western Union clock and tripped by the minute hand of the clock, then reset the stepping relay. Originally, 30-minute station identification was accomplished by a simulcast switch in the control booth for sister station WSJM, whereupon the disc jockey in the booth would announce \\"This is WSJM-AM and... (then pressing the momentary contact button) ...WSJM-FM, St. Joseph, Michigan.\\" This only lasted about six months, however, and a standard tape cartridge player was wired in to announce the station identification and triggered by the Western Union clock. Solidyne GMS200 tape recorder with computer self- adjustment. Argentina 1980-1990 A different technology appeared in 1980 with the analog recorders made by Solidyne, which used a computer-controlled tape positioning system. Four GMS 204 units were controlled from a 6809 microprocessor, with the program stored in a solid-state plug-in memory module. This system has a limited programming time of about eight hours. Satellite programming often used audible dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals to trigger events at affiliate stations. This allowed the automatic local insertion of ads and station IDs. Because there are 12 (or 16) tone pairs, and typically four tones were sent in rapid succession (less than one second), more events could be triggered than by sub-audible tones (usually 25 Hz and 35 Hz). Modern digital systems Modern systems run on hard disk, where all of the music, jingles, advertisements, voice tracks, and other announcements are stored. These audio files may be either compressed or uncompressed, or often with only minimal compression as a compromise between file size and quality. For radio software, these disks are usually in computers, sometimes running their own custom operating systems, but more often running as an application on a PC operating system. Scheduling was an important advance of these systems, allowing for exact timing. Some systems use GPS satellite receivers to obtain exact atomic time, for perfect synchronization with satellite-delivered programming. Reasonably-accurate timekeeping can also be obtained with the use of Internet protocols (IP) like Network Time Protocol (NTP). Automation systems are also more interactive than ever before with digital audio workstation (DAW) with console automation and can even record from a telephone hybrid to play back an edited conversation with a telephone caller. This is part of a system's live-assist mode. The use of automation software and voice tracks to replace live DJs is a current trend in radio broadcasting, done by many Internet radio and adult hits stations. Stations can even be voice-tracked from another city far away, now often delivering sound files over the Internet. In the U.S., this is a common practice under controversy for making radio more generic and artificial. Having local content is also touted as a way for traditional stations to compete with satellite radio, where there may be no radio personality on the air at all.

Television shows and television commercials, as well as digital on-screen graphics (DOG or BUG), can all be stored on video servers remotely controlled by computers utilizing the 9-Pin Protocol and the Video Disk Control Protocol (VDCP). These systems can be very extensive, tied-in with parts that allow the \\"ingest\\" (as it is called in the industry) of video from satellite networks and electronic news gathering (ENG) operations and management of the video library, including archival of footage for later use. In ATSC, Programming Metadata Communication Protocol (PMCP) is then used to pass information about the video through the airchain to Program and System Information Protocol (PSIP), which transmits the current electronic program guide (EPG) information over digital television to the viewer.

It stems from a paper I published this year bemoaning our inability to effectively monitor the energy flows associated with short-term climate variability.

Introduced in the 1994 film The Lion King, Walt Disney Animation's 32nd animated feature, the character subsequently appears in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998) and The Lion King 1¬Ω (2004) as well as the 2019 remake of the original film. Simba was created by screenwriters Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton. While Mark Henn served as Simba's supervising animator as a cub, Ruben A. Aquino animated the character as he appears as an adult. Simba was inspired by the character Bambi from Disney's Bambi (1942), as well as the stories of Moses and Joseph from the Bible. Additionally, several similarities have been drawn between Simba and Prince Hamlet from William Shakespeare's Hamlet. In 1997, The Lion King was adapted into a Broadway musical, with actors Scott Irby-Ranniar and Jason Raize originating the roles of the cub and adult Simbas, respectively. JD McCrary and Donald Glover voice the cub and adult Simba respectively in the CGI remake. Name Simba is a Swahili word for lion, reflecting Simba's origins in sub-Saharan Africa. It also has other definitions, such as king, strong, \\"born leader\\" or aggressive. Development =Conception= The idea for The Lion King originated from Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg in 1988 and was originally conceived under the title King of the Jungle. The story, which has been compared to Bambi (1942), was jokingly referred to as \\"Bambi in Africa\\" because of the similarities between the two films and their respective main characters. Co-director Rob Minkoff said that both films are \\"more true-life adventure than mythical epic.\\" Though considered an original coming-of-age story that follows the life of Simba as he grows up and \\"tak[es] on the responsibility of adulthood,\\" co-directors Roger Allers and Minkoff drew inspiration from other sources. In particular, the biblical figures Moses and Joseph served as creative inspiration for the character. Producer Don Hahn said that, like them, Simba is \\"born into royalty, is then exiled, and has to return to claim [his] kingdom.\\" Unlike the studio's three previous films The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992) which are essentially love stories, The Lion King revolves around Simba's relationship with his father instead, which Allers identified as \\"The real heart and emotional underpinning of the whole story\\". In April 1992, the filmmakers hosted a \\"brainstorming session\\" in which much of the film's original story was largely re-written, particularly Simba's personality. Originally, Simba was intended to remain with the pride after Mufasa's death until this idea was re-written in order to make the character more \\"likable and sympathetic.\\" Several film and entertainment critics have noted similarities and parallels between the stories of The Lion King and William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet, and their protagonists. Allers said that these similarities were not initially intentional and came as a surprise to the filmmakers themselves; they noticed the similarities only after the story was established and they eventually decided to pursue it. According to Hahn, \\"When we first pitched the revised outline of the movie ... someone in the room announced that its themes and relationships were similar to Hamlet. Everyone responded favorably to the idea that we were doing something Shakespearean, so we continued to look for ways to model our film on that all-time classic.\\" Screenwriter Jonathan Roberts said that, in a musical, songs are used to convey a character's emotions and \\"I wants.\\" Composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice wrote the song \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\" in order to give Simba a medium through which he can express his desire to become King of the Pride Lands. Roberts said, \\"It's a way for storytellers to move the story and deliver the direction of the character.\\" =Voice= Matthew Broderick voiced the adult Simba Matthew Broderick provided the speaking voice of adult Simba. The first actor to be assigned to The Lion King, Broderick learned of the role while he was on vacation in Ireland, where he received a telephone call from his agent informing him that the directors were interested in casting him as Simba after seeing his film Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986). The directors decided to cast him as Simba because they felt that he was \\"perfect\\" for the role; according to producer Don Hahn, Broderick's voice resembled \\"the kind of character who could be irresponsible and likeable, but you also felt that he could come back in a very heroic way.\\" Minkoff recalled that the actor \\"was able to humanize the hero character ... and give Simba a lot of depth\\", preventing the hero from \\"becoming 2-dimensional\\" using \\"brought a great deal of sensitivity and thoughtfulness to the role along with sincerity and a sense of humor.\\" Jonathan Taylor Thomas, who was starring as Randy Taylor on the television sitcom Home Improvement at the time, was cast as the speaking voice of Young Simba. His appearance and personality would later serve as creative inspiration for supervising animator Mark Henn. Despite often singing in his work, Broderick opted not to perform his own vocals in the film. Toto lead singer Joseph Williams and actor Jason Weaver were hired to dub their respective singing voices. Williams' voice is heard on the song \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\". Impressed by Weaver's performance as a young Michael Jackson in the miniseries The Jacksons: An American Dream, songwriters Elton John and Tim Rice recruited him to record \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\" and \\"Hakuna Matata\\" while the film was still in its early stages of production. As directors, Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff worked closely with the actors in order to ensure credible performances. As is frequently done in animated films, the filmmakers videotaped the actors while they recorded their dialogue, allowing the animators to incorporate their specific mannerisms into the designs of their characters. =Personality and design= When The Lion King was green-lit, its concept and story were not well received by studio employees. To guarantee the release of at least one successful film, Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg divided the studio into two separate projects: The Lion King and Pocahontas (1995), with Pocahontas expected to be the more successful of the two. Because of this assumption, the majority of the studio's more seasoned animators gravitated towards Pocahontas, while less experienced animators were assigned to work on The Lion King, which was deemed a \\"risk\\". Co-director Rob Minkoff received this positively, saying that this decision \\"gave a lot of newer animators a chance to step up to leadership roles.\\" The role of animating Simba was divided between Ruben A. Aquino and Mark Henn, the former of whom was the first animator to be assigned to the project. While Henn served as the supervising animator of Simba as a cub, credited as Young Simba, Aquino was placed in charge of animating the character as he appears as an adult. The Lion King was Disney's first animated feature film to feature absolutely no humans since Robin Hood (1973). According to Aquino, animating four-legged creatures is difficult because the artists are faced with the task of drawing \\"twice as many legs ... as you do with human characters\\" and must also attribute to them both human and animal- like qualities. For assistance, Aquino drew influence from previous animated films that feature four-legged creatures as their main characters, citing Bambi, Lady and the Tramp (1955) and The Jungle Book (1967) as his main sources of inspiration. Before The Lion King, Henn's experience as a supervising animator was limited to predominantly female characters; he had just recently completed work on Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989), Belle from Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Jasmine from Aladdin (1992). When he became involved with The Lion King, Henn initially expressed interest in animating the film's villain, Scar, because he wanted to do \\"something different.\\" However, producer Don Hahn felt that he was better suited for animating Simba. Henn approaches animating new characters by \\"put[ting himself] into the character's situation.\\" Simba proved to be a challenge because Henn was faced with the task of creating an animated character who would both appear and behave like a real lion cub. To achieve this, Henn visited zoos, sketched and studied live lion cubs that were brought into the studio for research, and frequently consulted with wildlife experts. Simba's short hair follows from the extreme heat of the lion's native climate, as does the thickness of the skin depicted on each paw, allowing him to swiftly navigate the grasslands. When it came time to animate Simba during the \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\" musical sequence, Henn felt it essential that the character remain on all fours at all times, despite the fact that he is meant to be dancing. In terms of personality, Henn aimed to depict Simba as a \\"cocky, confident character\\" at the beginning of the film, who must eventually mature and learn to take responsibility. The animators would often observe and document the voice actors while they recorded their dialogue, using their movements and mannerisms as a visual aid. Actor Jonathan Taylor Thomas, who provided the voice of Young Simba, served as inspiration for the design and personality of Simba. Henn said, \\"I loved watching Jonathan Taylor Thomas when he was a boy on Home Improvement, and getting to meet him and observe him.\\" Although Aquino was responsible for animating the majority of Simba's adult sequences, Henn animated the character's first appearance as an adult that occurs near the end of the \\"Hakuna Matata\\" musical number. Appearances =The Lion King= Simba, as a cub, during the first half of the original film. Released in theaters in 1994, The Lion King marks Simba's first appearance. All the animals in the Pride Lands gather at the foot of Pride Rock to commemorate the birth of Simba, who will eventually succeed to the throne and take his father Mufasa's place as king. Furious by the fact that he is no longer next in line, Simba's jealous uncle Scar refuses to attend the ceremony. While Simba grows into a rambunctious lion cub who frequently boasts about the fact that he will someday rule over the Pride Lands, Scar secretly plots against him. Scar plots regicide and familicide against Simba and Mufasa by luring Simba into a vast gorge, where he triggers a wildebeest stampede. Notified by Scar that Simba is in danger, Mufasa rushes to his aid and manages to place him safely on a ledge. Weakened and unable to pull himself up the steep slope to safety, Mufasa asks his brother for assistance. However, Scar's true nature is revealed and he betrays Mufasa, throwing him into the gorge where he is killed by the fall. Convinced by Scar that he is responsible for his father's death, Simba runs away to a distant jungle where he is befriended by Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him to ignore his past and avoid his responsibilities. There, he grows into an adult lion who vaguely resembles his late father, while Scar wreaks havoc on the Pride Lands. When Simba is discovered by his childhood friend named Nala, she confronts him, warning him of Scar's tyranny and begging him to return home. Afraid of facing his past, Simba refuses until a wise mandrill named Rafiki leads him to Mufasa's ghost, who convinces him to return home and reclaim his kingdom from Scar. Simba returns to the Pride Lands with Nala, Timon and Pumbaa and finds them barren because their natural resources have been squandered and abused by Scar. After witnessing Scar strike his mother Sarabi, Simba orders Scar to resign. At first thrown by the fact that he is alive, Scar soon regains composure and forces Simba to reveal that he is responsible for Mufasa's death, while cornering him at the edge of Pride Rock, hoping to subject him to a similar fate as his father. Having grown overconfident, Scar finally reveals to Simba that he killed Mufasa. Furious, Simba tackles Scar and forces him into announcing this to the pride, initiating a battle between Simba's pride of lionesses, Timon, Pumbaa and Scar's army of hyenas. Simba eventually defeats Scar and throws him into a pit, where he is cornered and killed by the hyenas, who overheard Scar blame them for what he'd done. Simba then takes his rightful place as king. When the kingdom returns to its former glory, the animals welcome the birth of King Simba and Queen Nala's firstborn. =The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride= A direct-to-video sequel released in 1998, Simba's Pride picks up immediately where the first film left off, depicting Simba and Nala as king and queen of the Pride Lands. In a ceremony at Pride Rock, the Pride Lands commemorate the birth of Simba and Nala's daughter Kiara, whom Simba is overprotective of. He discovers that Kiara has disobeyed him by visiting the forbidden Outlands, home to an enemy pride of Scar's followers known as the Outsiders, and befriending a young member of the pride named Kovu. After a close confrontation with Kovu's mother Zira, the leader of the Outsiders and Scar's most loyal follower, Simba separates the two and reminds Kiara of her responsibilities as the future queen. Meanwhile, Zira plots to manipulate Kovu to exact revenge on Simba for Scar's death. Several years later, Simba grants an adolescent Kiara's request to embark on her first hunt, but has Timon and Pumbaa follow her in secret. Realizing this, Kiara rebels and pursue her hunt outside of the Pride Lands, where she nearly falls victim to a wildfire. Kiara is rescued by Kovu, who returns her to the Pride Lands, which is actually part of Zira's plan to overthrow Simba. Saying that he has left the Outsiders, Kovu asks Simba to let him join his pride. Simba reluctantly accepts, but distrusts Kovu because of his similarities to Scar, and continues to treat him ruthlessly. That night, Simba has a nightmare about attempting to save his father Mufasa from falling into the stampede but is stopped by Scar who turns into Kovu and throws Simba off the cliff into the stampede. While Kiara and Kovu's friendship continues to grow, Simba, encouraged by Nala, attempts to show Kovu kindness by spending a day with him. Realizing that Kovu is beginning to side with Simba because of his love for Kiara, Zira ambushes and attacks Simba. Convinced by Zira that Kovu is responsible for the ambush, Simba exiles him and forbids Kiara to see him, but she makes her father realize that he is acting irrationally and trying too hard to be Mufasa, before leaving to find Kovu. When a battle ensues between the Pride Landers and the Outsiders, Kiara and Kovu arrive and stop them, with Kiara telling them that they are one, helping Simba to realize that despite their hatred for one another they are the same. This convinced Simba to accept the Outsiders back to his pride. When a furious Zira attacks Simba, she is intercepted by Kiara, causing the two to fall over the edge of a cliff. Having landed safely on a ledge, Kiara offers to help Zira, who is struggling to hang on. However, Zira, consumed by her resentment towards Simba, falls to her death. Simba finally approves of Kiara's love for Kovu and reconciles with his daughter, and accepts the two lions as the queen regnant and king consort of the Pride Lands. =The Lion King 1¬Ω= In The Lion King 1¬Ω, a direct-to-video followup released in 2004, Simba appears as a less prominent character because the film's primary focus is on Timon and Pumbaa's behind-the-scenes role and involvement in The Lion King, in which they appear as supporting characters. Although the two films technically share the same story and timeline, the plot of The Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata! focuses more on Timon and Pumbaa. The meerkat and warthog unknowingly coexist alongside Simba, and the story fills in the two characters' backstories and events that led up to their long- lasting friendship, coinciding with and often initiating the events that affect Simba's life during the first film. These events include the commemorative bow that occurs during the opening \\"Circle of Life\\" musical number and the collapsing of the animal tower that takes place during \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King.\\" The film also explores, in further detail, the relationship among the three characters as Timon and Pumbaa struggle to raise Simba as adoptive \\"parents\\" and disapprove of his relationship with Nala, portraying Simba as he grows from an energetic young lion cub, into an incorrigible teenager and, finally, an independent young lion. =The Lion King (2019)= Walt Disney Pictures has released an animated version of 1994 movie The Lion King.

The actor who previously work with Favreau in Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). Glover said that the film will focus more on Simba's time growing-up than the original film did, stating that \\"[Jon] was very keen in making sure we saw [Simba's] transition from boy to man and how hard that can be when there's been a deep trauma\\". On November 1, 2017, JD McCrary was cast as young Simba. McCrary said that \\"Donald Glover is so talented that [he] actually did have to take it into consideration, because if Simba is going to grow up to be some sort of figure and you know of it, you have to keep that motive\\". =Timon and Pumbaa and television= The success of The Lion King and popularity of its characters led to the production of Timon & Pumbaa, an animated television series starring Timon and Pumbaa. Simba makes several appearances, including one episode in which Timon drags him out to try to revive Pumbaa's lost memory. In the episode \\"Congo On Like This,\\" Timon and Pumbaa (especially Timon) suspect that Simba has reverted to his carnivorous nature. The episode \\"Shake Your Djibouti\\" again features Simba, when Timon and Pumbaa are forced to train him to protect them from a laboratory monster. Another episode, entitled \\"Rome Alone,\\" shows Simba being captured by Romans and forced into gladiatorial battle with another lion named Claudius. Simba makes brief appearances in \\"Once Upon a Timon\\", \\"Zazu's Off- By-One Day\\", and \\"Beethoven's Whiff\\". He also appears in a music video of \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\". Simba was featured as a guest in the animated series House of Mouse, in which he alternates between cub and adult. =The Lion Guard= In January 2016, a new series called The Lion Guard premiered, following a television pilot film The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar in November 2015. Set within the time gap in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, it features Kion who is the son and youngest child of Simba and Nala, who as the second-born cub, is tasked with assembling a team to protect the Pride Lands. =Broadway musical= The success of The Lion King led to the production of a Broadway musical based on the film. Directed by Julie Taymor, with a book by Irene Mecchi and Roger Allers, The Lion King premiered at the New Amsterdam Theatre on November 13, 1997, where it ran for nine years until being moved to the Minskoff Theatre on June 13, 2006. The role of Simba was originated by Scott Irby-Ranniar and Jason Raize, with Irby-Ranniar portraying Young Simba and Raize portraying Adult Simba. Raize auditioned for the role of Adult Simba after hearing that Taymor was looking to cast an actor who was of \\"unidentifiable ethnicity.\\" Raize revealed in an interview that there was a lot of competition for the role because the musical required \\"triple-threat work ‚Äì singing, dancing and acting ‚Äì that you don't get to such an extent in other shows. It was more the sense of who can take the challenge and not be daunted by the task.\\" Raize, who instantly felt that he \\"had a connection with Simba,\\" eventually won the role with the approval of Taymor and choreographer Garth Fagan, with Fagan admiring the fact that Raize was \\"willing to try, to fail, and then to try again.\\" Once cast, Raize found it difficult to maintain Taymor's \\"sense of duality\\" because Simba is \\"both man and beast.\\" He said, \\"The tendency is to sacrifice one for the other, but you can't.\\" Although hundreds of children auditioned for the role of Young Simba, the casting process was far less grueling for Irby-Ranniar who, according to Taymor, simply \\"walked in and he had the part.\\" =Miscellaneous= Books In 1994, a six-volume book set titled The Lion King: Six New Adventures were released. Set after the events of the first film, they featured a cub named Kopa, who was the son of Simba and Nala. Merchandising and video games As part of the franchise's merchandising, Simba has appeared in various The Lion King-related products. The character's likeness has been used in and adapted into a variety of items, including plush toys and figurines, clothing, bedding, household decor and appliances. The success of the Broadway musical has also led to its own line of merchandising, including the Simba beanbag doll, based on the character's appearance and costume in the Broadway show. Since the film's 1994 debut, Simba has appeared as a playable character in a variety of video game releases, both directly and indirectly associated with the franchise. The character's first appearance as a video game character was in The Lion King, which was released by Virgin Interactive on November 1, 1994, for the video game platforms Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Game Gear, Nintendo Entertainment System, and PC. The game follows the plot of the original film and features Simba as both a cub and an adult. On December 28, 2000, Activision released The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure for Game Boy Color and PlayStation. The game encompasses 10 levels and incorporates the plot of both The Lion King and The Lion King II: Simba's Pride as \\"Simba ... matures from a precocious cub to an adult lion.\\" Simba also appears as a playable character in Disney Interactive Studios' Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure, released on September 3, 2003, for Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox, and Disney Friends , released for Nintendo DS on February 26, 2008. Additionally, Simba appears in the Square Enix Kingdom Hearts video game franchise as a friend and ally of the series' main character, Sora. Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Live versions of Simba appear in the Lion King musical and in the parades and shows at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. Simba was also the main character in \\"Legend of the Lion King,\\" a former Fantasyland attraction in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, which retold the story of the film using fully articulated puppets. Other Disney attractions that have featured Simba include the Mickey's PhilharMagic 3D show and the Hong Kong Disneyland version of It's a Small World. He appeared as one of the main characters at Epcot's Land Pavilion 12-minute edutainment film Circle of Life: An Environmental Fable, until its closure in 2018. He currently appears in animatronic form in Festival of the Lion King at Disney's Animal Kingdom. Reception and legacy =Critical response= Although The Lion King itself has garnered universal acclaim from film critics, reception towards Simba has been generally mixed. The Christian Science Monitors David Sterritt hailed Simba as \\"a superbly realized character,\\" specifically praising the scene in which the character \\"faces discipline by his dad after his adventure with the hyenas.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Simba \\"has been given a marvelously expressive face\\" to the point of which \\"He seems more human than the Ken and Barbie types featured in Aladdin and The Little Mermaid.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described \\"the father- son relationship\\" shared by Simba and Mufasa as \\"movingly rendered,\\" while About.com's David Nusair wrote, \\"it's the touching father/son stuff that lies at the heart of the movie that cements The Lion Kings place as an utterly timeless piece of work.\\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews enjoyed the fact that the film focuses more on the story of Simba himself as opposed to the romantic relationship developing between the character and Nala. However, Berardinelli criticized Matthew Broderick's vocal performance, describing it as \\"nondescript.\\" Rob Humanick of Slant Magazine hailed the fact that \\"it's never laid on [Simba] that his time as king will directly correspond with the eventual passing of his father\\" as one of the film's \\"most important facets.\\" However, he criticized The Lion Kings characters, describing them as well- designed but \\"lazy and troublesome.\\" The Austin Chronicles Robert Faires felt that Simba and the other Lion King characters, though \\"true\\", were simply unoriginal retreads of preceding animated characters who were \\"swiped from other Disney cartoons.\\" Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the character a negative review. Labeling Timon and Pumbaa the only interesting characters in The Lion King, Hinson questioned Simba's role as the film's hero. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times agreed, \\"A movie's heroes may have their names above the title, but often as not it's the sidekicks who get the real work done.\\" Turan went on to pan Simba, describing him as \\"irritatingly callow.\\" Chris Hick of the Deseret News complained about the fact that Simba and the other \\"characters in The Lion King are not as warm and fuzzy as other Disney animated features,\\" crediting this with making \\"the film a bit tougher to warm [up] to.\\" ComingSoon.net strongly panned Simba as a lead character, writing, \\"typically for Disney animated fare, it's the hero who is the weak link being both blandly designed and blandly performed.\\" Acknowledging the character's Shakespearean origins, The Baltimore Suns Stephen Hunter gave Simba a negative review, writing, \\"Alas ...Simba stands in for Hamlet, but he's a lot less complicated; in fact, he's less complicated than Morris the Cat or Sylvester.\\" Hunter continued, \\"Simba the Exile is even less interesting than Simba the Prince.\\" Christopher Null of Contactmusic.com was critical of Weaver's performance as the singing voice of Young Simba, writing, \\"If there's anything annoying about the film, it's the singing. Young Simba sounds like a young Michael Jackson ... You almost don't want him to succeed.\\" However, Null reacted more positively towards Broderick's performance. Despite the character's mixed reception, several critics have awarded specific praise to Broderick for his portrayal of Simba, including the San Francisco Chronicles Peter Stack and The Washington Posts Desson Howe. Annette Basile of Filmink described Broderick's performance as \\"excellent,\\" while Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it \\"sumptuous.\\" Digital Spy's Mayer Nissim described Broderick's portrayal of Simba as \\"wonderful.\\" A number of critics and animators have noted striking similarities between Simba and Kimba, the protagonist of Osamu Tezuka's 1960s Japanese anime series Kimba the White Lion, and they believe Simba may have been inspired by Kimba.Schweizer, Peter and Rochelle Schweizer.

Since the film's 1994 release, this scene has grown to iconic status. In November 2002, singer Michael Jackson sparked controversy by holding his son over the protective railing of a hotel balcony in Berlin. The event was witnessed by a large crowd of spectators who were watching from below. Some sources have claimed that Jackson was harmlessly attempting to emulate the scene from The Lion King. When Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge went into labor with hers and Prince William's baby in July 2013, the idea that the couple should reenact the famous scene from The Lion King became quite popular among Twitter users. Radio journalist Darren Simpson reportedly tweeted, \\"when your baby arrives please re-enact the scene from the Lion King\\". Shortly after Middleton gave birth to a boy, England native Tommy Peto initiated a petition asking the couple to welcome their baby by having the Archbishop of Canterbury emulate the scene by holding him over the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Ultimately, the idea was deemed \\"outside the responsibility of the government\\" and was declined. The scene has found itself the subject of both reference and parody in various forms of media, such as in the film George of the Jungle (1997). In what is almost an exact replica of the scene, George, portrayed by actor Brendan Fraser, takes the place of both Rafiki and Mufasa by standing at the tip of Pride Rock and presenting his young son to a crowd of onlooking animals, accompanied by wife Ursula, portrayed by Leslie Mann. During the third season finale of Once Upon a Time, the main character Emma Swan asked her parents Snow White and David Nolan if they were going to hold up her yet unnamed baby brother like in The Lion King.Once Upon a Time, Season 3, \\"Snow Drifts\\" Since the release of The Lion King in 1994, the name \\"Simba\\" has increased in use and popularity among dog and cat owners.

Luyten 726-8B is also known under the variable star designation UV Ceti, being the archetype for the class of flare stars.  Star system  The star system was discovered in 1948 by Willem Jacob Luyten in the course of compiling a catalog of stars of high proper motion; he noted its exceptionally high proper motion of 3.37 arc seconds annually and cataloged it as Luyten 726-8. The two stars are of nearly equal brightness, with visual magnitudes of 12.7 and 13.2 as seen from Earth. They orbit one another every 26.5 years. The distance between the two stars varies from . The Luyten 726-8 system is approximately from Earth's Solar System, in the constellation Cetus, and is thus the seventh-closest star system to Earth. Its own nearest neighbor is Tau Ceti, away from it. If R_v=+29 km/s then approximately 28,700 years ago Luyten 726-8 was at its minimal distance of 2.21 pc (7.2 ly) from the Sun. Luyten-726-8A was later found to be a variable star and given the variable star designation BL Ceti. It is a red dwarf of spectral type M5.5e. It is also a flare star, and classified as a UV Ceti variable type, but it is not nearly as remarkable or extreme in its behavior as its companion star UV Ceti. BL Ceti is also known as G 272-061. UV Ceti by Andrew Posa (1982) Soon after the discovery of Luyten 726-8A, the companion star Luyten 726-8B was discovered. Like Luyten 726-8A, this star was also found to be variable and given the variable star designation UV Ceti. Although UV Ceti was not the first flare star discovered, it is the most prominent example of such a star, so similar flare stars are now classified as UV Ceti type variable stars. This star goes through fairly extreme changes of brightness: for instance, in 1952, its brightness increased by 75 times in only 20 seconds. UV Ceti is a red dwarf of spectral type M6.0e. In approximately 31,500 years, Luyten 726-8 will have a close encounter with Epsilon Eridani at the minimal distance of about 0.93 ly.

Development The RWD 7 was constructed by the RWD team of Stanis≈Çaw Rogalski, Stanis≈Çaw Wigura and Jerzy Drzewiecki in Warsaw. It was based upon their earlier designs, especially the RWD 2 and RWD 4. The RWD 7 was meant to be a record-beating plane, so it had a more powerful engine, while its mass was reduced. From its predecessors, it took the same fish-shaped fuselage without a direct view towards forward from the pilot's seat. The only RWD 7 built (registration SP-AGH) was flown in July 1931 by its designer Jerzy Drzewiecki. On August 12, 1931, Drzewiecki and Jerzy Wƒôdrychowski established an international FAI speed record of 178 km/h (111 mph) in the light touring plane class, (below 280 kg / 616 lb empty weight). On September 30, 1932, Drzewiecki and Antoni Kocjan set a height record of 6,023 m (19,755 ft). The RWD 7 was used in Warsaw Aero Club, among others, for aerobatics, then in 1936 it was bought by a known aviator Zbigniew Babi≈Ñski for touring flights and used until 1938. The RWD 7 was known for its extremely short take-off run: with a single crew member only 18 m (59 ft), with two crew members, 30 m (98 ft). Description The RWD 7 was a wooden construction, conventional in layout, high-wing cantilever monoplane. The fuselage was rectangular in cross- section (narrowing in upper part), plywood-covered, apart from the engine section, which was aluminium sheet-covered. The wings were trapezoid, single- spar, single part, canvas and plywood covered. A crew of two was sitting in tandem, with a pilot in the rear cab. The crew cabs were open on upper sides, and had doors on the right side. The engine was 5-cylinder Armstrong Siddeley Genet II radial engine, 56 kW (75 hp) nominal power. Two-blade wooden propeller of a fixed pitch. The plane had a conventional landing gear, with a rear skid. A 30 l fuel tank was in central part of wing. A cruise fuel consumption was 18 l/hour.

It is a loose adaptation of the early entries in the fighting game series Mortal Kombat and the first installment of the live-action Mortal Kombat film series. The plot of the film follows the warrior monk Liu Kang, the actor Johnny Cage, and the soldier Sonya Blade, all three guided by the god Raiden (spelled Rayden in the movie), on their journey to combat the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung and his forces in a tournament to save Earth. The film's primary source material was 1992's original game of the same title, but it was also inspired by and incorporates elements of 1993's follow-up game Mortal Kombat II. Mortal Kombat, a Lawrence Kasanoff/Threshold Entertainment production in association with Midway Games, was filmed primarily in Los Angeles, as well as on location in Thailand, and premiered on August 18, 1995 in the United States. It received mixed reviews from the critics with praise towards its martial art sequences, atmosphere, exotic locations and production values whereas the performances were criticized along with the simple script and the PG-13 rating. It is also includes the animated film, Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins. Mortal Kombat spent three weeks as the number-one film at the U.S. box office, earning over $122 million worldwide. Threshold Entertainment followed with a 1997 sequel film, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, and created two spin-off television series, Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm and Mortal Kombat: Conquest. Plot Mortal Kombat is a fighting tournament between the representatives of the realms of Earth and Outworld conceived by the Elder Gods amid looming invasion of the Earth by Outworld. If the realm of Outworld wins Mortal Kombat ten consecutive times, its Emperor Shao Kahn will be able to invade and conquer the Earthrealm. Wat Phra Si Sanphet was used in the film's opening for a fight between Shang Tsung and Liu Kang's brother Shaolin monk Liu Kang and his comrades, movie star Johnny Cage, and military officer Sonya Blade are chosen by Raiden, the god of thunder and defender of the Earth realm, to overcome their powerful adversaries in order to prevent Outworld from winning their tenth straight Mortal Kombat tournament. Each of the three has his or her own reason for competing: Liu seeks revenge against the tournament host Shang Tsung for killing his brother Chan; Sonya seeks revenge on an Australian crime lord Kano for murdering a fellow officer; and Cage seeks to prove that his martial-arts skills are real. Phra Nang beach was used for the fight between Liu Kang and Kitana At Shang Tsung's island, Liu is attracted to Princess Kitana, Shao Kahn's adopted daughter. Aware that Kitana is a dangerous adversary because she is the rightful heir to Outworld and that she will attempt to ally herself with the Earth warriors, Tsung orders the creature Reptile to spy on her. Liu defeats his first opponent and Sonya gets her revenge on Kano by snapping his neck. Cage encounters and barely beats Scorpion. Liu engages in a brief duel with Kitana, who secretly offers him cryptic advice for his next battle. Liu's next opponent is Sub-Zero, whose defense seems untouched because of his freezing abilities until Liu recalls Kitana's advice and uses it to kill Sub-Zero. Prince Goro enters the tournament and mercilessly crushes every opponent he faces. One of Cage's peers, Art \\"Kai\\" Lean, is defeated by Goro as well and has his soul taken by Shang Tsung. Sonya worries that they may not win against Goro, but Raiden disagrees. He reveals their own fears and egos are preventing them from winning the tournament. Wat Ratchaburana, Ayutthaya, was used as the place of confrontation between Liu Kang and Rayden Despite Sonya's warning, Cage comes to Tsung to request a fight with Goro. The sorcerer accepts on the condition that he be allowed to challenge any opponent of his choosing, anytime and anywhere he chooses. Raiden tries to intervene, but the conditions are agreed upon before he can do so. After Shang Tsung leaves, Raiden confronts Cage for what he has done in challenging Goro but is impressed when Cage shows his awareness of the gravity of the tournament. Cage faces Goro and uses guile and the element of surprise to defeat the defending champion. Now desperate, Tsung takes Sonya hostage and takes her to Outworld, intending to fight her as his opponent. Knowing that his powers are ineffective there and that Sonya cannot defeat Tsung by herself, Raiden sends Liu and Cage into Outworld in order to rescue Sonya and challenge Tsung. In Outworld, Liu is attacked by Reptile (under orders from Shang Tsung to prevent him and Cage from rescuing Sonya), but eventually gains the upper hand and defeats him. Afterward, Kitana meets up with Cage and Liu. She reveals to the pair the origins of both herself and Outworld. Kitana allies with them and helps them to infiltrate Tsung's castle while advising Liu Kang about three challenges in the castle: To face his enemy, himself and his worst fear. Inside the castle tower, Shang Tsung challenges Sonya to fight him, claiming that her refusal to accept will result in the Earth realm forfeiting Mortal Kombat (this is, in fact, a lie on Shang's part). All seems lost for Earth realm until Kitana, Liu, and Cage appear. Kitana berates Tsung for his treachery to the Emperor as Sonya is set free, claiming that his arrogance and greed will cost him the tournament if he doesn't honor his deal. Tsung challenges Cage but is counter-challenged by Liu. During the lengthy battle, Liu faces not only Tsung but the souls that Tsung had forcibly taken in past tournaments. In a last-ditch attempt to take advantage, Tsung morphs into Chan. Seeing through the charade, Liu renews his determination and ultimately fires an energy bolt at the sorcerer, knocking him down and impaling him on a bed of spikes. Tsung's death releases all of the captive souls, including Chan's. Before ascending to the afterlife, Chan tells Liu that he will remain with him in spirit until they are once again reunited. The Warriors return to Earthrealm, where a victory celebration is taking place at the Shaolin temple. The jubilation abruptly stops, however, when Shao Kahn's giant figure suddenly appears in the skies. When the Emperor declares that he has come for everyone's souls, Raiden declares \\"I don't think so,\\" and the warriors take up their fighting stances. Cast * Christopher Lambert as Raiden, god of thunder and protector of Earthrealm who guides the warriors on their journey. He desires to aid the heroes in defending Earthrealm, but as he himself is not mortal, he is not permitted to participate in the tournament and may only advise them and act to prevent cheating. * Robin Shou as Liu Kang, a former Shaolin monk, who enters the tournament to avenge his brother's death. He is also Kitana's love interest and among the first who notice her sympathy towards Earthrealm. As in most of the games in the Mortal Kombat series, Liu Kang is the main protagonist. This was Shou's second American film, as his first American role was in 1990, the made-for-television film Forbidden Nights. * Linden Ashby as Johnny Cage, a Hollywood superstar who enters the tournament to prove to the world that his martial arts skills are legitimate. Ashby trained in karate, tae kwon do, and kung fu especially for this film. Despite the intensity of the fight scenes coupled with the actors performing most of their own stunts, on-set injuries were minimal; the only notable occurrence was a bruised kidney Ashby suffered while shooting Cage's fight scene with Scorpion. * Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Shang Tsung, a powerful, sadistic and treacherous demon sorcerer, he is the film's main antagonist who kills Liu Kang's brother Chan. Tagawa was the filmmakers' first and only choice for the role; he was instantly selected after he came to his audition in costume, and read his lines while standing on a chair. Tagawa was allowed to play a \\"relatively young\\" version of Shang Tsung in order to avoid the excessive makeup that would have been required to duplicate the character's aged appearance in the first game. * Bridgette Wilson as Sonya Blade, an American Special Forces officer pursuing Kano after he kills her partner. Wilson, who was jokingly nicknamed \\"RoboBabe\\" during production by director Paul W. S. Anderson, performed all her own stunts, including fight scenes. * Talisa Soto as Princess Kitana, the Outworld emperor's adopted daughter who decides to help the Earth warriors. She is attracted to Liu Kang, who reciprocates and takes her advice to go further. Soto had previously appeared alongside Tagawa in Licence to Kill. * Trevor Goddard as Kano, an Australian underworld crime boss who joins forces with Shang Tsung. * Chris Casamassa as Scorpion, an undead ninja warrior under Shang Tsung's control. Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon voiced the character. * Fran√ßois Petit as Sub-Zero, a cryomancer ninja warrior under Shang Tsung's control. The rivalry between Scorpion and Sub-Zero is briefly mentioned by Shang Tsung at the beginning of the movie. * Keith Cooke as Reptile, a creature who serves Shang Tsung. Cooke portrayed the character's human form, while his lizard form was computer generated. Reptile's vocal effects were provided by Frank Welker. * Tom Woodruff, Jr. as Goro, prince of the subterranean realm of Shokan and general of the armies of Outworld. Goro is the reigning champion of Mortal Kombat. ** Kevin Michael Richardson provides the speaking voice of Goro, while his vocal effects are provided by Frank Welker. * Kenneth Edwards as Art Lean, a martial artist and friend of Johnny Cage who competes in the tournament. Lean is loosely based on Kung Lao. * Steven Ho as Chan Kang, Liu Kang's younger brother. * Gregory McKinney as Jax, Sonya's Special Forces partner. Steve James was originally cast, but died from pancreatic cancer on December 18, 1993, at the age of 41. * Peter Jason as Master Boyd, Johnny Cage's sensei. * Frank Welker provides the voice of the Outworld Emperor Shao Kahn. * Sandy Helberg as the director of Cage's latest film. This part was originally intended as a cameo by Steven Spielberg, but scheduling conflicts forced him to back out. Production Though the film is based on the original Mortal Kombat game, characters and gameplay elements from its sequel, Mortal Kombat II, were incorporated. The otherworldly dimension of Outworld was not formally mentioned until the second game, in which Jax, Kitana, and Shao Kahn, the game's final boss, also make their official debuts; Kahn briefly appears in the film's closing scene and is identified only as \\"the Emperor\\" throughout. Shang Tsung's soul-stealing power was first visualized in MKII as one of his Fatality finishing moves, while Liu Kang uses his \\"Bicycle Kick\\" special move from the game. After he kills Scorpion in his fight, Cage then drops an autographed picture of himself near his remains, in a reference to his Friendship finishing move. Shang Tsung's robed Shadow Priests, seen before the final battle, were first seen in the second game as background characters. Cameron Diaz was originally cast as Sonya Blade, but dropped out due to a wrist injury and was replaced by Bridgette Wilson. Steve James was originally cast to play Jax, but he died from pancreatic cancer a year before production on the film began. Brandon Lee was the filmmakers' first choice to play Johnny Cage, but his death at the set of The Crow forced them to re-cast the role. Jean-Claude Van Damme was offered the role but turned it down in order to do Street Fighter and the role eventually went to Linden Ashby. Gary Daniels, Tom Cruise, and Johnny Depp were also considered for the role of Johnny Cage. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113855/trivia?ref_=m_tt_trv_trv Russell Wong, Dustin Nguyen, Keith Cooke and Phillip Rhee all auditioned for the role of Liu Kang. Filming began in August 1994 and ended in December 1994. The Outworld exterior scenes were filmed at the abandoned Kaiser steel mill (now the Auto Club Speedway) in Fontana, California, while all of Goro's scenes were filmed in Los Angeles. Shooting locations in Thailand were accessible only by boat, so cast, crew and equipment had to be transported on long canoe-style vessels. Location manager Gerrit Folsom constructed an outhouse in a secluded area near the set in order to alleviate the problem of repeated trips to and from the mainland. Filming locations in Thailand include the Wat Phra Si Sanphet and Wat Ratchaburana temples. The arrival of Earth's contestants via boats, Liu Kang's meditation scene and the fight between Liu Kang and Kitana were filmed at the Railay Beach and the Phra Nang Beach, respectively. The bows of the boats were fitted with ornamental dragon-head carvings and used in the movie as the fighters' secondary transport to Shang Tsung's island from his personal junk. Robin Shou said that in the original script he \\"was supposed to fall in love with Talisa Soto [Kitana]. I was looking forward to it, but they thought we have so much action, we don't want to add romance to it. They cut it out.\\" Also scripted but not filmed were a short battle between Sonya and Jade, another of Shang Tsung's servants, and a scene where Shang Tsung allowed the heroes a night to mourn the loss of Art Lean and bury him in the Garden of Statues, underneath the statue of Kung Lao. The character of Reptile was originally omitted from the script but later added in response to focus groups being unimpressed with the film's early fight sequences. Robin Shou and Paul W. S. Anderson noted that neither knew what Reptile's lizard form would look like until after filming, making the pre-fight sequence difficult to shoot. The film was originally scheduled for a May 1995 U.S. release, but was pushed back to August. According to co-producer Larry Kasanoff, this was because New Line Cinema's executives felt the film had the potential to be a summer hit. It was released on October 20 in the United Kingdom, and on December 26 in Australia. Music The film's score album was composed by George S. Clinton, released by Rykodisc on October 11, 1995. The film's soundtrack album was released by TVT Records on August 15, 1995. The soundtrack album went platinum in less than a year reaching No. 10 on the Billboard 200. Reception =Box office= Mortal Kombat opened on August 18, 1995, and was #1 at the box office for the weekend, with $23.2 million, nearly eight times the opening amount of the only other new release that weekend, The Baby-Sitters Club. At the time, it was the second-highest August opening after 1993's The Fugitive. The film enjoyed a three-week stint at number one, grossed $70 million domestically, and earned an estimated $122 million worldwide. The film so far sits as the seventh highest-grossing video game adaptation ever released in the US, behind Sonic the Hedgehog, Detective Pikachu, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, The Angry Birds Movie, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, and Pok√©mon: The First Movie. =Critical response= Mortal Kombat received a score of 48% on Rotten Tomatoes sampled from 40 reviews, with an average score of 4.79/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Despite an effective otherworldly atmosphere and appropriately cheesy visuals, Mortal Kombat suffers from its poorly constructed plot, laughable dialogue, and subpar acting.\\" Metacritic gave the film a rating of 58/100, based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly called Mortal Kombat \\"a contentedly empty-headed extended advertisement for the joy of joypads (filmed in cheesily ornate cinema de Hong Kong style)\\" and too noted how it \\"is notably free of blood and gore.\\" According to Stephen Holden of The New York Times, \\"Mortal Kombat might be described as mythological junk food. Although there is talk of the three kombatants' having to face their deepest fears to prevail, the action is so frenetic and the dialogue so minimal that the allegory is weightless.\\" Roger Ebert said he was \\"right in the middle\\" and noted that the fans might be disappointed by the film's killings being much less brutal than the notoriously violent Mortal Kombat video games. Similar to Ebert, Marc Savlov from The Austin Chronicle mentioned that \\" It's the cinematic equivalent of cotton candy and Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots, but you may recall, you loved that stuff as a kid. I know I did\\" giving it a 2.5/5 star rating. Laura Evenson from San Francisco Chronicle mentioned \\"Mortal Kombat the movie has everything a teenage boy could want: snakes that jut out of a villain's palms, acrobatic kung- fu fighting and a couple of battling babes. Everything, that is, but an interesting plot, decent dialogue and compelling acting\\" commenting however that it will likely become a cult classic. Kevin Thomas of Los Angeles Times gave the film a much more positive review, writing that \\"as impressive as the special effects are at every turn, even more crucial is Jonathan Carlson's superb, imaginative production design, which combines Thailand exteriors with vast sets that recall the barbaric grandeur of exotic old movie palaces and campy Maria Montez epics. John R. Leonetti's glorious, shadowy camera work and George S. Clinton's driving, hard-edged score complete the task of bringing alive the perilous Outworld\\". Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave it a \\"thumbs up\\" rating on Siskel & Ebert, calling it \\"the only half-way decent video game movie [he] has ever seen\\" and \\"a lot of fun,\\" saying he was positively surprised by its various high quality production values, including the \\"often sensational\\" special effects, exotic locations and the cast of characters being \\"clearly drawn out of appealing types\\". Leonard Klady from Variety awarded the film a 3.5/5 stars stating that \\"But where others have sunk in the mire of imitation, director Paul Anderson and writer Kevin Droney effect a viable balance between exquisitely choreographed action and ironic visual and verbal counterpoint\\". Kim Newman from Empire magazine said \\"By the time the big, world-saving bout comes around, it's hard not to wish that Shung Tsu [sic] would settle the fate of mankind by asking Liu Kang what the capital of Venezuela is... rather than engaging him in yet another round of supernaturally assisted dirty fighting\\" with a final rating of 3 stars out of 5. Other media =Sequel= The sequel Mortal Kombat: Annihilation was released in 1997, directed by John R. Leonetti (cinematographer of the first Mortal Kombat). Only Robin Shou and Talisa Soto reprised their roles, with the others being recast. The film also stars Brian Thompson, Sandra Hess, Lynn \\"Red\\" Williams, Irina Pantaeva, Marjean Holden and James Remar. Its storyline is largely an adaptation of Mortal Kombat 3, following a band of warriors as they attempt to save Earth from Shao Kahn himself. Although the story picks up where the last film left off, most of the lead roles were recast. In contrast to its predecessor, which was a box office success and marginally well- received, Annihilation was critically panned and failed at the box office. As a result, development of the planned third installment halted and never progressed beyond pre-production. In July 2009, actors Chris Casamassa (Scorpion) and Linden Ashby (Johnny Cage) separately announced that they would be reprising their respective roles from the original film, with Casamassa additionally claiming that filming would begin in September of that year, but the project did not commence production. =Animated film= On April 11, 1995, New Line Home Video, Turner Home Entertainment and Threshold Entertainment released a tie-in animated film on VHS and Laserdisc, titled Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins. Serving as a prequel to the feature film, it follows the protagonists Liu Kang, Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade as they travel on a mysterious boat to the Mortal Kombat tournament. On the way they meet Raiden, who provides them with some hints about how to survive the tournament and defeat Shang Tsung and his army of Tarkatan minions. Upon arriving at the island where the battles takes place, Raiden retells the origins of Shang Tsung, Goro, Scorpion, Sub-Zero and the Great Kung Lao in between fight scenes. The film featured a combination of traditional animation, motion capture, and CGI to explain the origins behind some of the movie's main characters, as well as a fifteen-minute behind-the-scenes documentary of the theatrical release. Trailers of the film were seen on the promotional screener VHS copy, and on other VHS releases from Turner Home Entertainment and New Line Home Video. The film was included on the Mortal Kombat Blu-ray released in April 2011. =Novelization= A novelization of the movie by \\"Martin Delrio\\" (James D. Macdonald and Debra Doyle) was released through Tor Books. It is based on an early version of the film's script, and as such it includes several deleted or unfilmed scenes, such as a fight between Sonya Blade and Jade. =Television= Two television series, the animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm and the live-action series Mortal Kombat: Conquest, were produced by Threshold Entertainment between 1996 and 1999. =Reboot= It was announced that a reboot film is currently under development and scheduled for release by Warner Bros. Pictures on January 15, 2021.

Most of the major languages belonging to language branches and groups of Europe, and Western and southern Asia, belong to the Indo-European language family. Therefore, Indo-European is the biggest language family in the world by number of mother tongue speakers (but not by number of languages in which it is the 3rd or 5th biggest). Eight of the top ten biggest languages, by number of native speakers, are Indo- European. One of these languages, English, is the de facto World Lingua Franca with an estimate of over one billion second language speakers. Each subfamily or linguistic branch in this list contains many subgroups and individual languages. Indo-European language family has 10 known branches or subfamilies, of which eight are living and two are extinct. The relation of Indo-European branches, how they are related to one another and branched from the ancestral proto-language is a matter of further research and not yet well known. There are some individual Indo-European languages that are unclassified within the language family, they are not yet classified in a branch and could be members of their own branch. The 449 Indo-European languages identified in the SIL estimate, 2018 edition, are mostly living languages, however, if all the known extinct Indo-European languages are added, they number more than 800 or close to one thousand. This list includes all known Indo-European languages, living and extinct. A distinction between a language and a dialect is not clear-cut and simple because there is, in many cases, several dialect continuums, transitional dialects and languages and also because there is no consensual standard to what amount of vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation and prosody differences there is a language or there is a dialect. (Mutual intelligibility can be a standard but there are closely related languages that are also mutual intelligible to some degree, even if it is an asymmetric intelligibility.) Because of this, in this list, several dialect groups and some individual dialects of languages are shown (in italics), especially if a language is or was spoken by a large number of people and over a big land area, but also if it has or had divergent dialects. The ancestral population and language, Proto-Indo-Europeans that spoke Proto-Indo-European, estimated to have lived about 4500 BCE (6500 BP), at some time in the past, starting about 4000 BCE (6000 BP) expanded through migration and cultural influence. This started a complex process of population blend or population replacement, acculturation and language change of peoples in many regions of western and southern Eurasia. This process gave origin to many languages and branches of this language family. At the end of the second millennium BC Indo-European speakers were many millions and lived in a vast geographical area in most of western and southern Eurasia (including western Central Asia). In the following two millennia the number of speakers of Indo-European languages increased even further. By geographical area, Indo-European languages remained spoken in big land areas, although most of western Central Asia and Asia Minor was lost to another language family (mainly Turkic) due to Turkic expansion, conquests and settlement (after the middle of the first millennium AD and the beginning and middle of the second millennium AD respectively) and also to Mongol invasions and conquests (that changed Central Asia ethnolinguistic composition). Another land area lost to non-Indo-European languages was today's Hungary due to Magyar/Hungarian (Uralic language speakers) conquest and settlement. However, in the second half of the second millennium AD, Indo-European languages expanded their territories to North Asia (Siberia), through Russian expansion, and North America, South America, Australia and New Zealand as the result of the age of European discoveries and European conquests through the expansions of the Portuguese, Spanish, French, English and the Dutch. (These peoples had the biggest continental or maritime empires in the world and their countries were major powers.) The contact between different peoples and languages, especially as a result of European colonization, also gave origin to the many pidgins, creoles and mixed languages that are mainly based in Indo-European languages (many of which are spoken in island groups and coastal regions).

Anthony Although all Indo-European languages descend from a common ancestor called Proto-Indo-European, the kinship between the subfamilies or branches (large groups of more closely related languages within the language family), that descend from other more recent proto- languages, is not the same because there are subfamilies that are closer or further, and they did not split-off at the same time, the affinity or kinship of Indo-European subfamilies or branches between themselves is still an unresolved and controversial issue (the reason for they are shown as separate and by alphabetical order in this list of Indo-European languages). Using a mathematical analysis borrowed from evolutionary biology, Don Ringe and Tandy Warnow propose the following tree of Indo-European branches:Anthony, David W.

The company is headquartered in Valletta and operates over 30 branches and offices throughout the islands of Malta and Gozo. HSBC Bank Malta is part of the European region within HSBC and therefore reports to HSBC Bank plc. History HSBC Malta dates back to the commencement of operations in Malta by the Anglo-Egyptian Bank (est. 1864), which merged with the National Bank of South Africa and Colonial Bank (est. 1836) to become Barclays Bank Dominion Colonial Overseas in 1925 after Barclays acquired the Colonial Bank when it acquired the London Provincial and South Western Bank in 1918. In 1954 the bank shortened its name to Barclays Bank D.C.O. and in 1971 became Barclays Bank International. =Nationalisation= In 1975 the government of Malta nationalized Barclays Bank International's operations in Malta and renamed it Mid-Med Bank, exercising its option to purchase Barclays‚Äô remaining shareholding in Mid-Med in 1979. In 1991 the Maltese government sold 33% of Mid-Med Bank to the public and in 1993 Mid-Med listed on Malta‚Äôs stock exchange. Mid-Med acquired 25% of Lohombus Bank, which specializes in housing finance, in 1995 along with the Investment Finance Bank in Malta. Mid-Med gained a majority of Lohombus Bank in Malta when it acquired another 35% of the firm in 1996, the same year it established a representative office in London. =Mid-Med joins the HSBC Group= Midland Bank was the first foreign bank to be granted an unlimited banking licence in Malta, where it opened a branch in September 1996. Then in 1999, Midland Bank acquired the government of Malta‚Äôs 67.1% direct holding in Mid-Med, as well its 2.7% indirect holdings. Part of the agreement was that for the time being the bank would continue to be listed in the Maltese stock market and that Midland would not make a formal offer for the remainder of the shares but could buy if other shareholders chose to sell. At the time, Mid-Med bank had 60 offices and branches, 1,800 staff and was the largest commercial bank in Malta. When HSBC brought all its operations under a common name, Mid-Med became HSBC Malta Bank plc. HSBC absorbed Mid-Med‚Äôs representative offices in Dubai, Milan, and Luxembourg into the HSBC offices in their respective countries but established a \\"Malta Desk\\" in several of these countries. Lohombus Bank became HSBC Malta (Home Loans) Ltd. =Malta Call Centre= In April 2006 HSBC announced that it would be opening a new call centre in Malta, with an investment of ‚Ç¨7 million and the creation of 350 jobs. The centre will deal with calls from HSBC Bank's customers in the United Kingdom, and operate as a branch of that company, under the oversight of HSBC Malta management.

His most famous work is Tsurezuregusa (Essays in Idleness), one of the most studied works of medieval Japanese literature. Kenko wrote during the Muromachi and Kamakura periods. Life and work Kenk≈ç was probably born in 1283, the son of an administration official. Forged documents by the Yoshida Shinto authorities claimed that his original name was Urabe Kaneyoshi (ÂçúÈÉ® ÂÖºÂ•Ω), and that his last name was later Yoshida (ÂêâÁî∞); all of this was recently demonstrated to be false, in new research by Ogawa Takeo. ; see also „ÄåÂçúÈÉ®ÂÖºÂ•Ω‰ºùÊâπÂà§‚àí„ÄåÂÖºÂ•ΩÊ≥ïÂ∏´„Äç„Åã„Çâ„ÄåÂêâÁî∞ÂÖºÂ•Ω„Äç„Å∏„ÄçÔºà„ÄéÂõΩË™ûÂõΩÊñáÁ†îÁ©∂„Äè49Âè∑„ÄÅ2014Âπ¥3ÊúàÔºâ He became an officer of guards at the Imperial palace. Late in life he retired from public life and became a Buddhist monk and hermit. The reasons for this are unknown, but it has been conjectured that either his unhappy love for the daughter of the prefect of Iga Province or his mourning over the death of Emperor Go-Uda caused his transformation. Although he also wrote poetry and entered some poetry contests at the imperial court (his participation in 1335 and 1344 is documented), Kenk≈ç's enduring fame is based on Tsurezuregusa, his collection of 243 short essays, published posthumously. Although traditionally translated as \\"Essays in Idleness,\\" a more accurate translation would be \\"Notes from Leisure Hours\\" or \\"Leisure Hour Notes.\\" Themes of the essays include the beauty of nature, the transience of life, traditions, friendship, and other abstract concepts. The work was written in the zuihitsu (\\"follow- the-brush\\") style, a type of stream-of-consciousness writing that allowed the writer's brush to skip from one topic to the next, led only by the direction of thoughts. Some are brief remarks of only a sentence or two; others recount a story over a few pages, often with discursive personal commentary added. The Tsurezuregusa was already popular in the 15th century and was considered a classic from the 17th century onward.

The building includes the temporary Senate chamber, as well as some Senate offices and committee rooms. The building served as Ottawa's central railway station until 1966, and from 1966 to 2018 it was operated by the federal government as the Government Conference Centre. It is situated at the intersection of Wellington Street and the Rideau Canal, across the street from the Ch√¢teau Laurier hotel (which was constructed around the same time). It is from Parliament Hill and Confederation Square. History =History of Railways in Ottawa= Broad Street Station, 1908, replaced a station lost in the great 1900 Hull‚ÄìOttawa fire Before the turn of the twentieth century, several railway companies had run lines into the city and had begun to build railway stations. In chronological order: #New Edinburgh: Bytown and Prescott Railway #Broad Street: Canada Central Railway, QMO&O;: 1870, 1881, 1896, 1900 #Elgin Street: Canada Atlantic Railway: early 1880s #Nicholas Street at Mann Avenue: Ottawa and New York Railway: 1895 Broad Street, in the Lebreton Flats area, was the site of several stations including the first Union station (1881), which perished by fire in 1896 and again in 1900 and was rebuilt each time. The last one closed in 1920. Broad Street was near the Prince of Wales Bridge, the link to Montreal via the north shore of the Ottawa River. Broad Street itself no longer exists, erased as part of the National Capital Commission's efforts at improving the capital area. Ottawa became part of the Canadian Pacific Railway's transcontinental rail service on June 28, 1886, when the first Pacific Express arrived at Broad Street from Montreal via Lachute and Hull, Quebec, on its way to Sudbury, Winnipeg, Calgary, and Port Moody, B.C. It used the existing Prince of Wales Bridge to cross the Ottawa River near the site of the present-day O-Train Bayview Station, west of Parliament Hill. This rail bridge had been built in 1880 by the Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and Occidental Railway and was transferred to Canadian Pacific in 1882. However, there was no centrally located station until 1895, through efforts of John Rudolphus Booth. Booth was a Canadian lumber baron known for creating Canada's largest sawmill right in Ottawa, near Chaudi√®re Falls. His mill's capacity exceeded the distribution infrastructure, and he looked to rail as a solution. (Eighteen years previous, he had established the Canada Atlantic Railway.) Booth had built a central depot in 1895 just south of Rideau Street, on the east side of the canal and reachable by way of a covered stairway from Sappers Bridge.Woods, 1980, p.206 The station seemed to not be truly serving the needs of the railway companies, since it was built for the interests of the Canada Atlantic Railway. CPR's Royal Alexandra Interprovincial Bridge built in 1901 became the second railway bridge to cross the Ottawa River between Ottawa and Hull. It led to Booth's central depot. In 1905, Booth sold the Canada Atlantic Railway to the Grand Trunk Railway.Woods, 1980, p.207 In 1910, the Grand Trunk was apportioned part of the Rideau Canal in order to build a new station and hotel. The hotel would become the famous Chateau Laurier, and the station would become Ottawa's Union Station. =Construction of Union Station= Construction of the station with view of railway lines and the Rideau Canal The building was opened by the Grand Trunk Railway in 1912 as Ottawa's central railway station, and the hotel was built across the street to serve travellers. Over the course of the following years, passenger services of other railways moved to this station, thereby clarifying and unifying passenger travel in the city. Page 28. When the last Canadian Pacific trains moved from the old Union Station on Broad Street to Grand Trunk Central station on January 4, 1920, the old station was closed and the Grand Trunk station became Ottawa Union Station. The June 1912 opening of the Union Station and the Chateau Laurier was not met with much fanfare, since Grand Trunk Railway general manager Charles Melville Hays had just perished in the Titanic disaster two months previously. The Doric Roman Revival multi pillar Union station was originally designed by New York-based architect Bradford Lee Gilbert who was eventually dismissed due to concerns of mismanagement. The Montreal firm of Ross and MacFarlane took over the project, making many design changes to the station. Page 73. Ross and MacFarlane also took over the design of the Ch√¢teau Laurier and later built Toronto's Union Station. Both Canadian National Railways (successor to the Grand Trunk) and Canadian Pacific Railway operated regularly scheduled passenger trains through the facility until it ceased operations on July 31, 1966. =Connection to Railways= Several tracks which originated from the main railway infrastructure in Ottawa ran immediately adjacent to the Rideau Canal (right on its east banks) and led northward into the city. They approached Union Station through several sheds. From the sheds, emerged two tracks (on the east side of the Rideau Canal), and continued along, proceeding under the bridge where Wellington Street crosses the canal. They then ran immediately adjacent to the west side of Chateau Laurier, in a structure which was used for a time in a converted form, by the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography. The track continued, where there is now a paved road and ran to the Alexandra (Interprovincial) Bridge. Once in Hull, there was the possibility to continue to other parts of Quebec, or to return to Ottawa by making a turn and returning over the Prince of Wales Bridge. Some of the pathways in present-day Gatineau are on locations where rails had once made this possible. =Post 1966= In 1966, the National Capital Commission decided to remove the tracks along the east side of the Canal as part of an urban renewal plan. They were replaced by a scenic drive, and a new Ottawa station was built just east of Ottawa's downtown area in the neighbourhood of Eastway Gardens. While the NCC had originally planned to tear down the structure, it was spared, becoming the centre of Canada's centenary celebrations in 1967. After sitting empty for many years, it was turned into the Government Conference Centre. A new entrance and canopy at the rear of the building was built to provide greater security for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers meeting held in 1973. The same year, artist Bruce Garner sculpted bronze doors for the new entrance, titled Reflections of Canada. The tracks and sheds south of the station were demolished and now taken over by Colonel By Drive and the Rideau Centre. =Current usage and architecture= Interior view of Waiting Room, which was inspired by the Baths of Caracalla It has since been home to many gatherings of civil servants and politicians. In 2001, the building hosted the G20 conference, a gathering of 20 finance ministers from around the world. As well as hosting conferences, the building is also sometimes used as a gallery. A section of the Berlin wall was on display inside the main entrance from September 27, 1991, until January 29, 2011. Because the location of the display was not widely publicized, it was decided that the segment would be more prominent at its new location in the Canadian War Museum. The building is inspired by the Beaux-Arts architectural style. The main departures hall (now the main conference area) is based on the Great Hall of the Roman Baths of Caracalla at 3/4 scale. It is therefore similar to the now-destroyed departures hall of New York Penn Station. The cavernous structure has never been well suited to its role as a conference centre. In the mid-1990s a proposal was made to turn it into the new home for the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, but these plans fell through. In his final year in office, Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien announced that the building would become home to a new museum of Canadian political history, but incoming Prime Minister Paul Martin cancelled this project, and it has remained a conference centre. In 2007, the idea of reverting the building back to its original use sprang up as Ottawa considered various proposals for regional commuter rail systems. It is seen as being feasible to do so (although it would require a long tunnel to reconnect to the existing railway tracks) ; however, the Government of Canada's Department of Public Works says the building is not for sale. =Temporary Senate of Canada building= Restored plasterwork in the Main Hall Restored and painted coffered ceiling In July 2013, it was announced by Public Works Canada that the building would be used to temporarily accommodate the Senate chamber (in the main concourse of the old train station) along with 21 Senate offices and three committee rooms (in the old general waiting room) while the Centre Block undergoes major rehabilitation work projected to take up to ten years. It was decided that the need to rehabilitate this historical building presented a perfect opportunity to find an interim home for the Senate.Questions and Answers for the Government Conference Centre . The works which are already well under way, will include: * seismic reinforcement; * restoration of the masonry; * replacement of roofing materials including skylights, replacement of obsolete electrical, mechanical and life safety systems to meet current codes; * renovation of the interior space; * removal of outdated conference amenities added in the 1960s (i.e. translation booths); * conformity to universal accessibility requirements; * abatement of hazardous materials; and * expansion of the loading dock, to improve serviceability limitations of the building.

The merged company was named Ipsos MORI. Methodology Ipsos MORI's research is conducted via a wide range of methodologies, using computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI), as well as face-to-face (CAPI) and Internet surveys. Many telephone surveys use a system called random digit dialing to interview a representative group of the population. Controversies In May 2013, The Sunday Times reported that Ipsos MORI had negotiated an agreement with the EE mobile phone network to commercialise the data on that company‚Äôs 23 million subscribers. The article stated that Ipsos MORI was looking to sell this data to the Metropolitan Police and other parties. The data included \\"gender, age, postcode, websites visited, time of day text is sent [and] location of customer when call is made\\". When confronted by the newspaper, the Metropolitan Police indicated that they would not be taking the discussions any further. Ipsos MORI defended their actions, stressing that the company only received anonymised data, without any personally identifiable data on an individual customer, and underlining that reports are only ever made on aggregated groups of more than 50 customers.

The expression is borrowed from \\"sales pitch\\".Karg, Van Over, Sutherland, p. 84 A pitch is used throughout different stages of production, such as casting and distribution, as well as to urge film producers to further fund a project.Steiff, p. 58 Filmmakers who devise a pitch tend to manufacture a production package, which is handed out to each potential investor during the pitch. The package contains the basic information for the filmmaker's project, such as a plot synopsis and budgeting values.Karg, Van Over, Sutherland, p. 86 Sometimes, filmmakers will produce an independent pitch trailer as a part of the package to help potential financiers better visualize the project and the filmmaker's vision. Though pitches are usually made on the basis of a full script or teleplay, animated productions for both film and television are often pitched on the basis of storyboards alone. For example, the animated television show Phineas and Ferb was pitched from a storyboard. Co-founders of the project, Dan Povenmire and Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh, needed to convince overseas executives for The Walt Disney Company to greenlight the series, so they drew a storyboard and recorded it as a reel. They then mixed it and dubbed it over with sound effects, voices, and narrative, then sent the recording to the executives, who accepted it. Television pitches can also be devised by the network or company that produces the program. Certain networks are pitched the idea of including a character in a series in order to boost ratings. Such pitches have been used with \\"Oliver\\" in The Brady Bunch and \\"Luke\\" on Growing Pains.Alberti, p. 144 Networks also try to force their ideas on series' producers through their pitches, though their approach is business-oriented and their ideas are generally not favored by writers and viewers.Alberti, pp. 145-147 In 1992, the crew of the animated series Rugrats was approached by Nickelodeon, which pitched the idea of a Rugrats Hanukkah special. Paul Germain, co-creator of the series, responded by suggesting a passover special, which he dubbed a \\"funny idea.\\" After they closed production for that special, they began considering the Hanukkah special and eventually created it in 1996 as the episode \\"A Rugrats Chanukah.\\" References Further reading *Aguado, Ken & Eboch, Douglas (2013).

A member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba, he was first elected in the 2003 provincial election, and was re- elected in 2007, 2011, 2016, and most recently in 2019.  Early life and education  Goertzen was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba but was raised in Steinbach, Manitoba. He attended public school in Steinbach and graduated high school from the Steinbach Regional Secondary School in June 1987. Goertzen obtained a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Economics, a Bachelor of Commerce and a Bachelor of Law each from the University of Manitoba. While attending Robson Hall law school at the University of Manitoba, Goertzen was awarded more than a dozen academic prizes and was the school's top student during his second year of law studies.  Community involvement  Goertzen served for two years as the Vice-President of the Steinbach Arts Council and served as Vice- President of the Southeast Helping Hands Food Bank in Steinbach for seven years. He has been involved as a participant and fundraiser in a number of community related causes including the Mennonite Heritage Village Museum and the Steinbach Association for Community Living. He is a member of the South East Rotary Club. In June 2007, Goertzen was awarded the \\"HOPE\\" medal by the Lions Club Foundation of Manitoba and Northwestern Ontario for his community service work helping those less fortunate in Manitoba. In 2012 he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in recognition of community service by Governor General of Canada David Johnson.  Political involvement Goertzen became involved in political activities while attending high school, serving as an early organizer for the Reform Party of Canada. In 1995, Goertzen was hired as an intern at the Manitoba Legislature serving with the Progressive Conservative Caucus. Following the internship, he served in the Manitoba Department of Culture, Heritage and Citizenship and subsequently worked as an Executive Assistant to MLAs Jim Penner and Albert Driedger. Following the 2000 federal election, Goertzen also worked as an advisor to Provencher Member of Parliament Vic Toews and was a key local organizer for Toews in the 2000, 2004 and 2006 federal elections. In 2003, he participated in a public protest against the legalization of same-sex marriage in Canada. Prior to seeking elected office himself, Goertzen also served as the President of the Steinbach Progressive Conservative Association, as a Regional Director on the Board of the Manitoba Progressive Conservative Party and as a member of the Management Committee of the Manitoba Progressive Conservative Party.  Elected office  One week prior to the calling of the 2003 provincial election, Steinbach MLA Jim Penner announced he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and would not be seeking re-election. After the election was called a short nomination process occurred. Some critics suggested Goertzen's service as local association President gave him an advantage in the short nomination time frame. The sudden events had no impact on the election result, however. Steinbach is an extremely safe seat for the Progressive Conservatives, and Goertzen was elected with over 74% of its popular vote, despite the poor showing of PC candidates elsewhere in the province. Goertzen became the youngest MLA ever elected in the Steinbach Constituency (age 33) as well as the first Manitoba Legislative Intern to be elected to the Manitoba Legislature. After his election to the Manitoba Legislature, Goertzen was appointed his Party's Chief Justice Critic and in 2005 was also appointed Deputy House Leader. As Justice Critic, Goertzen has called for increased police resources, stronger laws against organized crime, electronic monitoring of sex offenders and a drug treatment court to assist individuals addicted to drugs and alcohol. In 2005-2006, Goertzen held a series of informational meetings across Manitoba about Crystal Meth and lobbied for new legislation to allow parents of drug addicted teenagers to place their children in drug treatment. The NDP government accepted that suggestion and legislation was passed June 13, 2006. Goertzen was a strong supporter of Manitoba P.C. Leader Stuart Murray and refused to participate in internal Caucus dissent that ultimately led to the end of Murray's leadership in November 2005. Goertzen was among the first MLAs to endorse the provincial PC leadership campaign of Hugh McFadyen who eventually won the leadership. McFadyen reappointed Goertzen as Justice Critic after his leadership election and also appointed him the Progressive Conservative House Leader. Goertzen was again nominated the provincial PC candidate for Steinbach on September 8, 2006. On May 22, 2007 Goertzen was re-elected in the Steinbach Constituency with 83% of the vote, the largest Progressive Conservative victory in the history of the riding. In February 2010, Goertzen was named Deputy Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba. On October 4, 2011, Goertzen was re-elected in the Steinbach constituency by another larger majority, although the PC's once again lost the election to the NDP. With the resignation of McFayden as party leader after the election, there has been some speculation in the local media that Goertzen may be a candidate for the position. Following the 2011 election and selection of Brian Pallister as leader of the Manitoba Progressive Conservative Party, Goertzen was again appointed House Leader and Justice Critic for the PC Caucus. In 2013 he led a filibuster in the Manitoba Legislature to protest the increase of the provincial sales tax (PST) by the NDP government. Despite widespread media speculation, he declined to run for the Conservative Party of Canada in the federal riding of Provencher in 2013 following the resignation of MP Vic Toews. Following the Progressive Conservative victory in the 2016 provincial election, newly-elected premier Brian Pallister named Goertzen as a member of the new cabinet, assigning him the office of Health, Seniors and Active Living.  Personal  Goertzen married his wife Kimberley (Hiebert) in 1997. They live in Steinbach and have one son. Goertzen has published several articles related to law and politics including in the Asper Review of International Business and Trade Law (Volume 3- 2003) and Underneath the Golden Boy (Volume 3-2004). In November 2006, he published a book on the life of Jim Penner, his predecessor in the Legislature, entitled A Life Well Lived: The Story of Jim Penner and Penner Foods (National Library of Canada ).

It is the oldest established financial services provider in Malta and one of the largest. As of 2014, the bank had 44 branches, 6 regional business centres, a head office, and a wealth management arm located around the Maltese Islands. It has representative offices in the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium and Italy. History BOV headquarters in Santa Venera With the advent of British rule in Malta, a group of English and Maltese merchants established Anglo-Maltese Bank, which commenced operations on 23 June 1809. Banco di Malta was established on 1 May 1812. Anglo-Maltese Bank and Banco di Malta began early on to issue their own promissory banknotes (payable at sight) at first in Scudi denominations and subsequently in Sterling. The third bank to be set up in Malta was B. Tagliaferro e Figli, which too was founded in 1812. The fourth bank established in Malta was Josef Scicluna et Fils, set up in 1830. These four banks would eventually merge, in stages, to form the National Bank of Malta. This was done in order to have strength in numbers at a time when there was a fear that the government was after the private banks . Anglo-Maltese Bank and Banco di Malta merged in January 1946 under the name National Bank of Malta. In 1949 Sciclunas Bank affiliated to the newly established bank. Twenty years after that, i.e., in 1969, National Bank of Malta merged with Tagliaferro Bank through an exchange of shares.Banking and Finance in the Mediterranean: A Historical Perspective, edited by Mr John A Consiglio, Mr Juan Carlos Martinez Oliva, Professor Gabriel Tortella In 1973,https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20081104/books/achievement- tragedy-and-failure.231867 following a run on the National Bank of Malta and its subsidiary Tagliaferro Bank, the Maltese government after Parliament passed the 'National and Tagliaferro Banks (Temporary Provision) Act 1973'. The run on the bank is widely considered to have been orchestrated by the then government in an attempt to take control of the banking sector in Malta. On 22 March 1974 the Prime Minister Dom Mintoff announced the setting up of the Bank of Valletta. The new Bank took over the assets and liabilities of the National Bank of Malta, and commenced operations on 25 March 1974. The banking reform was described as a \\"hijack\\" by Adrain Busietta, as it created a number of controversies for those who had assets. The National Bank's liabilities were artificially inflated by 151% by the government in an attempt to make it appear as insolvent.https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/55956/national_bank_shareholders_claiming_325_million_in_compensation#.XGGA8lwzZPY The Government, injected Lm3.3 million (equivalent to ‚Ç¨7.7 million) into the new Bank in return for a 60 percent share of the capital. The Malta Development Corporation took up the remaining 40 percent, and in time sold 20 percent to the Banco di Sicilia and 10 percent to the Maltese public. In 1986, the Bank inaugurated its first overseas representative office. In 1990, the Maltese government reduced its stake in Bank to 51 percent by issuing and offering 4.9 million shares to the public. That same year Bank of Valletta launched its fully owned investment bank - the subsidiary Valletta Investment Bank. In 1992, Bank of Valletta International started operating. This wholly owned international banking subsidiary of the Bank of Valletta Group was Malta's first Offshore Bank. That same year Bank of Valletta became the first bank to be listed on the Malta Stock Exchange. In 1995 Bank of Valletta and Insight Investment Management Limited established the Valletta Fund Management. In September 2000, BOV set up its stockbroking arm, BOV Stockbrokers Limited (\\"BOVSL\\"). In time, Bank of Valleta amalgamated Bank of Valletta International Limited, Valletta Investment Bank Limited, Card Services Limited, and BOVSL. Bank of Valletta branch in Marsaxlokk Bank of Valletta continued to evolve its internationalisation through the opening of other representative offices in the Euro-Mediterranean region, though it closed the representative offices in Cairo and Tunis in 2011. With Malta's accession into the European Union, Bank of Valletta has become an active member of the European Savings Banks Group. On 9 January 2014 a Maltese court found that the shareholders of the National Bank of Malta had suffered human rights abuses when the government of Malta had in 1975 forced them to sign away their shares for zero compensation. On 6 February 2014 a Maltese court again found that shareholders of the National Bank of Malta had their rights violated when their assets were taken by the Government of Malta. The government of Malta appealed these decisions, both the Constitutional Court of Malta has now confirmed the judgements of the previous courts. Shareholders will be able to negotiate a compensation package that is likely to involve Bank of Valletta shares.  Shareholding  In 1992, the Bank became the first public company to be listed on the Malta Stock Exchange. Presently, 25% of the Bank's equity is held by the Government of Malta, UniCredit S.p.A. holds 10.20% and the remaining 64.80% is in the hands of the general public.

The Randi Rhodes Show is live streamed having been previously broadcast nationally on Air America Radio, Nova M Radio, and Premiere Radio Networks. Early life Rhodes was born Randi Joyce Bueten in Brooklyn, New York to a Jewish family.; accessed February 11, 2012 via LexisNexis. \\"'Judaism is the culture I was raised in,' [Rhodes] said. 'I was breast-fed by caterers, therefore I am an attention whore. But don't call me a JAP (Jewish American Princess). Call me stylish.'\\" Randi grew up in the Brooklyn and Queens boroughs of New York City, her father was a mechanical engineer and World War II veteran and her mother was a dress shop worker; they divorced by the time Rhodes was 15 years old. Rhodes has described her adolescence as mischievous and cites it as why she enlisted in the United States Air Force. Her married name is Randi Robertson. Rhodes is a radio name chosen to honor Ozzy Osbourne's guitar player Randy Rhoads, whom Rhodes describes as \\"a consummate professional ... but he always practiced. I mean, he practiced eight hours a day. He lived to be the best.\\" Military experience Rhodes enlisted in the United States Air Force and worked stateside at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey as an aircraft mechanic, achieving the rank of Airman first class (E-3). She served two years in the Air Force and one year in the reserves. Rhodes went through basic training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. From there she went to Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls, Texas and was being trained as a flight engineer. After she transferred to what would be her permanent station in New Jersey, she decided to leave the active-duty Air Force through the Palace Chase program and was honorably discharged after three years service (two active duty and one reserve) at the age of 21. In the 1980 presidential election, Rhodes voted for Republican candidate Ronald Reagan, explaining: \\"I was young and stupid and sick of the gas lines\\", but never voted Republican again. Radio career =Early work= Rhodes' radio career began in Seminole, Texas at a country music station. Her next job was in a larger market, Mobile, Alabama. While in Mobile, she was paired briefly with a male DJ (also named Randy) for the \\"Randy and Randi\\" morning show. This was her first experience with extemporaneous dialogue other than reading cue cards between records. She used this experience as a spring-board to larger markets. In the late 1980s, she was hired out of that medium market directly to New York City by WAPP \\"The Apple\\", owned at the time by Doubleday Broadcasting. While working for WAPP, she took the name \\"Randi Rhodes,\\" having previously used \\"Randi St. John\\". While teaming with host Perry Stone at Milwaukee's WQFM, Rhodes was suspended in 1987 when their program offended the gay community and led several businesses to cancel ads. In late September 1992, Rhodes started on WIOD in Miami, working the 8P-11P night shift. The Miami Herald described her as \\"a chain-smoking bottle blond, ... part Joan Rivers, part shock jock Howard Stern and part Saturday Night Live's 'Coffee Talk' lady. But mostly, she's her rude, crude, loud, brazen, gleeful self.\\" =Air America Radio (2004‚Äì2008)= Randi Rhodes broadcasts from the Democratic National Convention in 2008. In 2004, Rhodes joined Air America Radio, bringing The Randi Rhodes Show to a national audience for the first time. Rhodes' show on Air America consisted principally of monologue and listener calls, with a short comedic segment at the beginning of the show's second and third hours. Only occasionally did she do interviews. The show was punctuated with musical interludes, including the show's unofficial theme song, Pain by Stereomud. On Fridays, Rhodes opened the show with the song \\"Bounce Your Boobies\\" by Rusty Warren. With her distinctive Brooklyn-Queens accent, she would take calls spanning the political spectrum, aggressively promoting her views. In 2007, Rhodes was recognized by the radio industry's well known periodical, Talkers Magazine as Woman of the Year.Talker's Magazine coverage Reports of mugging In October 2007, rumors of Rhodes having been mugged in New York were fueled by Air America host Jon Elliott, who had said she was attacked at 39th and Park Avenue while walking her dog, Simon on October 14. Elliott also said Rhodes lost several teeth, and speculated the attack could have been part of a right-wing conspiracy. On October 17, the New York Daily News reported Rhodes never filed a police report, nor did she claim to be the victim of a mugging. Rhodes' attorney confirmed Rhodes was injured in a fall while walking her dog, and said Rhodes wasn't sure how it had happened. Elliott issued an apology for his on-air comments. Departure from Air America Air America suspended Rhodes from the network on April 3, 2008 after an event in San Francisco for Air America affiliate KKGN. While doing a stand-up comedy act, Rhodes said on March 22, 2008: > \\"Geraldine Ferraro turned out to be the David Duke in drag ... What a whore > Geraldine Ferraro is! She's such a fucking whore! I wanna see her have to > stand beside her husband at one of those mandatory 'I have sinned against > you; I'm a whore' kind of a press conference. Mr. Ferraro should have to > stand next to his whore of a wife ... Hillary is a big fucking whore, too. > You know why she's a big fucking whore? Because her deal is always, 'Read > the fine print, asshole!'\\" When a video of the event was made public the following week, Air America suspended her for \\"inappropriate comments\\". The event was billed as \\"An Evening with Randi Rhodes\\" and promoted on KKGN's website. Geraldine Ferraro called for Rhodes' employment to be terminated when the personal attacks directed towards her and Clinton began circulating through the media. Rhodes claimed that Air America breached its contract with her, and questioned the network's commitment to free speech. On April 10, 2008, Rhodes went on Larry King Live to clarify her suspension from the network. Later that evening, she conducted an interview on The Mike Malloy Show in which Rhodes went into greater detail concerning the suspension. Air America had recently been sold. The new owner read her existing contract and wanted to amend two details: Rhodes' right to terminate at any time, and a clause that said Air America could not terminate Rhodes for any reason without paying her. Rhodes refused to amend the contract, which she said took \\"seven months to negotiate with the previous owners.\\" Air America suspended her until a settlement could be reached concerning the contract which was still in place and had an additional year to run. In the interim, Air America management decided to conduct market research to assess her value to the company. According to Rhodes, it was Air America which released the press release that called attention to the video of her performance in San Francisco simply as a way to gauge her audience loyalty and her value to the network. She also claimed Air America soon asked her to return to the air, with an offer of more money but still holding to the condition that she had to change her contract \\"in order to get her mic back\\". Rhodes refused and left Air America because of the stalemate over the new contract. Mark Green, President of Air America Radio, said, \\"Her abusive, obscene comments obviously crossed the line of what talent at a media company could say,\\" and added that the comments \\"were in the Imus league\\", referring to radio host Don Imus, who was fired by CBS Radio in 2007 after making racial remarks about female basketball players. According to a published account, Green said the company had asked Rhodes to apologize for the remarks. In the same account, Rhodes said she did not refuse to apologize for the comment. Air America Media informed Rhodes on April 9 that the contract was terminated. Air America president Mark Green issued a statement wishing Rhodes well, and thanking her for her work with Air America. Meanwhile, KKGN announced on its website that The Randi Rhodes Show would return to Green 960 as of April 14, 2008. Air America also terminated access to The Randi Rhodes Show web site, redirecting it to a statement by the chairman and president on the Air America site. Rhodes stated at 3:42pm, EDT on April 14 that she, not Air America, owns the URL name. The message board was reinstated on May 5, 2008. =Nova M Radio (2008‚Äì2009)= On April 10, 2008, Nova M Radio announced Rhodes would join its radio network, which also syndicated The Mike Malloy Show. During the show's first Nova M broadcast on April 14, 2008, Rhodes went into detail concerning the events surrounding her suspension. She described what happened as \\"a great radio story and I've heard some great radio stories in my day.\\"Novamnetwork.com April 14, 2008 , (requires paid subscription) The Randi Rhodes show returned to the airwaves on April 21, 2008 on 23 affiliate stations,Nova M Radio Affiliates , April 15, 2008 compared to Air America's 60 affiliates.Air America Stations ; accessed April 15, 2008. As of May 5, 2008, the show was heard on 28 stations, including XM 167. On her program's inaugural Nova M Radio broadcast she also said that she had objected to Air America's new owners demanding her contract be amended to remove her walk-away clause. She said her salary was also an issue. Rhodes' last show on Nova M was February 3, 2009. Political commentator and one-time Congressional candidate Nancy Skinner hosted the show in Rhodes' absence beginning February 5. Following this, Anita Drobny of Nova M Radio posted a message on the Nova M site saying that they were unable to disclose details of what was going on due to Rhodes' having complete control of the show and that Rhodes \\"now has to make her decisions as to what she must do with her career\\". Drobny also said, \\"People are saying it's about money. It's not about money at all. I just could not fulfill one of her requirements.\\" She did, however, note the financial impact of Rhodes' departure: \\"I looked at [our] site, and I see that because Randi Rhodes isn't on, there are so many people leaving the Founders Club [which involved a fee that was paid to Nova M]. And you can't operate without people's participation.\\" Additionally, Rhodes' own website was taken down and replaced with a letter from Rhodes to her supporters stating that the entire situation was within Nova M's control and any implication that Rhodes was responsible for the disruption was false, and that Rhodes' show would be \\"seeking a new home\\" in light of those developments. According to an individual familiar with the issue, Nova M agreed to provide certain standard legal protections for the popular radio host, but Rhodes had to leave the air and discovered that Nova M had not lived up to its contractual promise. Subsequently, on February 19, 2009, Nova M Radio announced that it would be filing for bankruptcy liquidation. The Nova M Radio website was taken down in April 2009. =Premiere Radio Networks (2009‚Äì2014)= On April 23, 2009, Premiere Radio Networks, a subsidiary of Clear Channel Communications, announced the addition of Randi Rhodes to their syndicated lineup with her show returning to airways across the country May 11, 2009. Her eponymous program, The Randi Rhodes Show, aired live Monday through Friday from 3pm to 6pm Eastern Time. Her show ended on May 16, 2014.Allaccess.comRadioink.com A statement from a Premiere spokesperson said: \\"I can confirm Randi Rhodes has decided to end her national radio program.\\" =Dark Horse Broadcasting (2016‚Äìpresent)= In 2016, Randi Rhodes initiated a Kickstarter campaign to return The Randi Rhodes Show from which she received 1,951 pledges in the amount of $152,063.Kickstarter The show began live streaming publicly on July 5, 2016, four days after it was streamed privately to supporters of the Kickstarter campaign. Personal life In 1994 Rhodes married Jim Robertson, an independent television producer and cameraman. They had been together for ten years prior to marrying. Rhodes and Robertson divorced in April 2004 but have remained friends. Rhodes took the name Robertson when she married, but continued to use her professionally known name on the air. In 1998, Rhodes' sister Ellen died of breast cancer at age 44. Rhodes and Robertson raised Ellen's daughter Jessica as their own. Rhodes' partner is Howard Vine, a former partner in the Public Policy practice of Dickstein Shapiro. Previously, he was founder and managing shareholder of the Greenberg Traurig Washington DC office. Now retired, he is a board member of Faith in America, a group working to end harm to LGBT youth caused by religious teachings. He was an adviser to the Clinton/Gore transition team.

He served as the chief scientist on the Challenger expedition; his work there revolutionised oceanography and led to his knighthood. Life Thomson was born at Bonsyde, in Linlithgow, West Lothian, on 5 March 1830, the son of Andrew Thomson, a surgeon in the service of the East India Company, and his wife Sarah Ann Drummond Smith. He was baptised Wyville Thomas Charles Thomson, and changed his name in 1876. He was educated under Charles Chalmers at Merchiston Castle School, then from 1845 studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh graduating with an MD. However, his focus turned from medicine to natural science, and he joined the Botanical Society of Edinburgh in 1847, and soon after became secretary to the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh. In 1850 he was attending the botany class of John Hutton Balfour at the University. In 1850 he was appointed lecturer of botany, and in 1851 professor of botany, at the University of Aberdeen. In 1853 he became a professor of natural history in Queen's College, Cork, Ireland, succeeding Professor Hincks. A year later he was nominated to the chair of mineralogy and geology at the Queen's University of Belfast. In 1855 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being his former tutor, John Hutton Balfour. He served as the Society's Vice President from 1877 to 1882. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1869. In 1860 was transferred to the chair of natural history at the same institution. In 1868 he assumed the duties of professor of botany at the Royal College of Science, Dublin, and finally in 1870 he received the natural history chair at the University of Edinburgh. In 1871‚Äì72 he served as President of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh. Interests Wyville Thomson is remembered for his studies of the biological conditions of the deep seas. Being interested in crinoids, and prompted by the results of the dredgings of Michael Sars in the deep sea off the Norwegian coasts, he persuaded the Royal Navy to grant him use of HMS Lightning and for deep sea dredging expeditions in the summers of 1868 and 1869. They showed that animal life existed down to depths of 650 fathoms (1200 m), that all marine invertebrate groups are present at this depth, and that deep-sea temperatures are not as constant as had been supposed, but vary considerably, and indicate oceanic circulation. These results were described in The Depths of the Sea, which he published in 1873. Challenger expedition The remarkable hydrographic and zoological results which Wyville Thomson had demonstrated, in addition to the growing demands of ocean telegraphy, soon led to the Royal Navy to grant use of for a global expedition. Wyville Thomson was selected as chief scientist, and the ship sailed on 23 December 1872. Aftermath The Challenger Expedition was deemed a great success, and on his return Wyville Thomson received a number of academic honours, as well as a knighthood. In 1873 he published \\"Depths of the Sea\\" based on initial findings from the expedition.Harmsworth Encyclopedia 1905 In 1880 he published two volumes (having completed writing in 1877), The Voyage of the Challenger in the Atlantic, a preliminary account of the results of the voyage. He spent the next two years working on administrative duties connected with the publication of the full monograph of the voyage. Wyville Thomson had a highly strung mentality, and his health was generally poor throughout his life. He found dealing with publishers over the requirements of publishing 50 volumes of detailed illustration and scientific description enormously stressful. In 1879 he ceased to perform his university duties, gave up overseeing the reports of the expedition in 1881, took to his bed and died a broken man at Bonsyde on 10 March 1882. The publishing was finally completed by his friend and colleague Sir John Murray. Wyville Thomson is commemorated in the stained glass window above the altar in St. Michael's Parish Church, Linlithgow and his headstone is in the churchyard. In addition the Wyville-Thomson Ridge in the North Atlantic Ocean is named after him. The headstone of Charles Wyville Thomson in St. Michael's Parish Churchyard. Evolution Thomson had criticised natural selection, stating it was not enough to explain the evolution of species. Replying in the Nature journal, Charles Darwin commented that \\"I am sorry to find that Sir Wyville Thomson does not under stand the principle of natural selection, as explained by Mr. Wallace and myself... Can Sir Wyville Thomson name any one who has said that the evolution of species depends only on natural selection?\\"Darwin, Charles. (1880). Sir Wyville Thomson and Natural Selection. Nature 23: 32.

Haarlem is one of the cities in the Netherlands that has a number of hofjes. Some of them are even still in use with boards of regents. Many of these are members of the Stichting Haarlemse Hofjes (Foundation Hofjes of Haarlem). The word 'hofje' just means small garden, because the hofjes are generally small houses grouped around a community kitchen garden with a water pump. Often they were attached to a larger field for bleaching linen or growing orchards, but today those fields have been long used for city expansion and only the central gardens can still be seen. Early Hospitals St. Elisabeth's Gasthuys was the first city hospital of Haarlem and associated with the Hofje van Loo. This doorway was used as an entrance from 1581 to the 20th century. Central courtyard and main building of Johan Ensched√© Hof What we would call 'social work' today was called charity work in earlier centuries. Hofjes in Haarlem are the remnants of charity work that were founded by defunct community structures that were divided by religious order and social class, but all more or less guided by the then prevailing need to perform the Christian Seven Works of Mercy; feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, bury the dead, shelter the traveler, comfort the sick, and free the imprisoned. Committing any of these acts would gain the giver entrance through the pearly gates of Heaven. This is what prompted so many wealthy Haarlem citizens to found Hofjes in their name on their death. In Haarlem the city council became responsible for acts of mercy on a grand scale when the leper colony was founded outside the city walls in the town of Schoten in 1393. For centuries from all over Holland, lepers had to come to Haarlem to get an attestatie or proof of leprosy, as a legal permit to beg. Similarly, the Haarlem Beul, or city executioner, \\"freed\\" prisoners all over the country from Amsterdam to Ghent by chopping their heads off. This led to the Dutch saying zo brutaal als de beul van Haarlem, meaning \\"as brutal as the Haarlem executioner\\". This morbid practise was only stopped in the beginning of the 17th century. The Haarlem leper colony, Het Dolhuys, still exists and is currently a museum. In 1347, the first mention of a 'Gasthuys' is made in Haarlem archives. After the leper colony was founded (in the name of Saint Lazarus), a new gasthuys, in the name of Saint Elisabeth, was built on the Verwulft where the sick were treated that did not need quarantine outside the city walls. This hospital existed and grew until the fire that burned it down. Hofje van Loo was an add-on that survived. The Elisabeth Gasthuys (later called EG) was rebuilt on the location of a former monastery (cellenbroers or minnebroers) in the Groot Heiligland (across the street from the Frans Hals Museum today) where it operated from 1581 to 1971. Originally a church institution, it was now run by Haarlem council members, due to the Protestant Reformation. Since the German occupation of World War II, this hospital is no longer run by the Haarlem council, but still exists and is called the Kennemer Gasthuis today. The former buildings in the Groot Heiligland house a community center and have been converted to homes. Management The hofjes are managed by five board members called regents. Any community structure in Haarlem, be it a guild or a hofje, had a group of five regents or regentesses. Whenever there was a change of board members, a commemorative painting would be made. In paintings by Frans Hals' the regents of the Poor men's almshouse and the regents of the St. Elisabeth Gasthuys can be seen. Many guilds kept hofjes for their own aging members. When the guilds were disbanded under the French occupation in 1794, the guild regents kept their role as hofje regents, since the hofjes were at that time still quite wealthy. With the tiercering in 1810 however, the lack of revenues from both government bonds and guild membership dues was sorely felt and many hofjes went bankrupt and were disbanded. Wealth It was the duty of the regents to care for the books and the behavior of the members. Many hofjes were quite wealthy, due to the high turnover of its members, who had to donate all of their possessions to the hofje in order to be accepted for living there. Other sources of income were lotteries, that were organized to build new premises or restore old ones. The living conditions between the various hofjes varied substantially, with each religious order competing to keep the most luxurious one. Today most of the surviving hofjes receive their income from housing rents. Origins When talking of hofjes, most people refer to the name given to the buildings themselves, but the foundations they are based on may have moved premises several times since the original foundation date, and even changed their names. Hofjes in Haarlem were primarily the result of generous bequests by wealthy men or women in their own name, rather than from any group religious or municipal effort. Most hofjes were meant for elderly women, because there were far more poor aged women in the streets than poor aged men. However, after the iconoclasm of the Reformation in Haarlem in 1566, the Catholics (and their hofjes) were forced underground, and many became quite poor. When the 'Oudemannenhuis' opened in 1609, many of the poor men who were accepted were Catholics.

The inhabitants of Calimera, alongside Italian, also speak Griko, a Greek dialect. The language, folklore, traditions and history of Calimera, like those of the eight other cities in the area called \\"Salentine Greece\\", reveal significant Greek influences over the course of time, presumably from the time of the Byzantine control, or even the ancient Magna Graecia colonisation in the 8th century BCE. In the park, there is a small monument containing an ancient Attic burial stone, given by the city of Athens to Calimera in 1960. At the top of this monument is a motto, referring to the burial stone: \\"Zeni su en ise ett√π sti Kalimera\\" (in Greek script: Œ§œÉŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑ 'œÉŒøœç 'ŒµŒΩ ŒµŒØœÉŒ±Œπ ŒµœÑŒøœç œÉœÑŒ∑ ŒöŒ±ŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ±), meaning \\"You are not a stranger here in Calimera\\", which underlines the close relationship and common origins of Calimera with the rest of Greek civilisation.

The Four Freshmen is considered a vocal band because the singers accompany themselves on guitar, horns, bass, and drums, among other instrumental configurations. The group was founded in 1948 in Indiana and reached its peak popularity in the mid-1950s. The last original member retired in 1993,\\"A Visit with Bob Flanigan of The Four Freshmen\\" with Sun City Anthem's Channel 99's music editor, Yvonne Cloutier but the group stills tours internationally and has recorded jazz harmonies since its late 1940s founding in the halls of the Jordan School of Music at Butler University in Indianapolis. History In early 1948, brothers Ross and Don Barbour formed a barbershop quartet called Hal's Harmonizers at Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana. The Harmonizers also included Marvin Pruitt‚Äîsoon replaced by Ross and Don's cousin Bob Flanigan‚Äîand Hal Kratzsch (1925‚Äì70), replaced in 1953 by Ken Errair. The quartet soon adopted a more jazz-oriented repertoire and renamed itself the Toppers. At first, they were influenced by Glenn Miller's The Modernaires and Mel Torm√©'s Mel-Tones, but soon developed their own style of improvised vocal harmony. In September 1948, the quartet went on the road as the Four Freshmen, and soon drew the admiration of jazz legends such as Dizzy Gillespie and Woody Herman. On March 21, 1950, Stan Kenton heard the quartet at the Esquire Lounge in Dayton, Ohio. He \\"had been told at his own show earlier that night about a quartet in town that sounded like his 43-piece ensemble\\", and was sufficiently impressed that he arranged for an audition with his label, Capitol Records, which signed them later that year. The demo included \\"Laura\\", \\"Basin' Street Blues\\", \\"Dry Bones\\", and two other songs. In 1950, they released a single, \\"Mr. B's Blues\\", and appeared in their first and only film, Rich, Young and Pretty. The Freshmen released another single in 1951, '\\"Now You Know\\", which was not a commercial success. Later in the year Capitol rejected their proposed next single, \\"It's a Blue World\\", and dropped them from the label. In May of the following year, a furious Stan Kenton demanded that the record company send them the demo tapes so that they could promote the song themselves. They managed to get the song onto the radio, and in 1952, \\"It's a Blue World\\" became their first charted single. Capitol re-signed the group in July of the same year. In 1953, Hal Kratzsch, tired of touring, asked the group to replace him, and they selected Ken Errair. Their single to chart was \\"It Happened Once Before\\", and the year ended with them winning the Down Beat magazine poll as Best Jazz Vocal Group of 1953. In 1954, the Freshmen recorded their first album, Voices in Modern; \\"Mood Indigo\\", a single from this album, charted. The following year, they released \\"How Can I Tell Her\\" and \\"Charmaine\\", followed by \\"Graduation Day\\" in 1956. Their album Four Freshmen and 5 Trombones \\"set the standard for modern jazz vocal groups\\" and reached number 6. After only a short time with the group, Ken Errair left the band to get married, and was replaced by Ken Albers. Around this time, the group started playing at college auditoriums and pursuing a younger audience. In 1960, the Freshmen recorded \\"Their Hearts Were Full of Spring\\", a song which, with different lyrics, later became The Beach Boys' \\"A Young Man Is Gone\\" in 1963. The group eventually lost their mainstream following with the advent of the rock bands of the 1960s, even as one of those bands, the Beach Boys, cited the Four Freshmen as one of their main influences. The next Freshmen to leave was Don Barbour, who left in 1960 and was replaced by Bill Comstock. The group did not disband after the last original member, Bob Flanigan, retired in 1993. After his retirement, Flanigan managed the group. He died on May 15, 2011 at the age of 84 from congestive heart failure. Ross Barbour died on August 20, 2011 from cancer at the age of 82. The Four Freshmen have had many different members. Bob Ferreira joined the legacy of the Four Freshmen in 1993 with Curtis Calderon becoming part in 2001. Stein Malvey's contributions began in 2013. Tommy Boynton took over the lead voice in 2015 and the band welcomed Jon Gaines in 2016. Style The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians says that \\"The group represented a modernizing force in the sphere of close harmony quartets in American popular music, moving away from the barbershop style to introduce elements of jazz. In doing so, they influenced younger groups such as the Hi-Los and the Beach Boys.\\" The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Second Edition (2001), entry by Dave Laing, edited by Stanley Sadie, executive director John Tyrell, Grove: New York. The Oxford Companion to Popular Music says, \\"They sing with great variety, in quiet unison or full- throated harmony, using modern jazz harmonies and varied dynamics, a considerable advance on the typical close-harmony quartets that had preceded them.\\"The Oxford Companion to Popular Music (1991), Peter Gammond, Oxford University Press: Oxford, New York. Influence The Four Freshmen were an important influence on Brian Wilson, beginning in the mid-50s. He listened to one of their albums, The Four Freshmen and the Five Trombones, and it \\"mesmerized\\" him. He spoke very highly of it: \\"'It brings a feeling of love inside me.... That feeling of harmony.'\\"Carlin, Peter Ames (2006), \\"Catch A Wave: The Rise, Fall & Redemption of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson\\": Rodale. p. 39 Aside from listening to their music, the teenage Wilson made a point of seeing the Four Freshmen perform live: \\"he made solitary pilgrimages to the resort hotels of Catalina Island to see the Four Freshmen.\\"Carlin, Peter Ames (2006), \\"Catch A Wave: The Rise, Fall & Redemption of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson\\": Rodale. p.43 The Four Freshmen are also credited with influencing The Lettermen, The Four Preps and The Manhattan Transfer, among other vocal groups. The Donald Fagen song \\"Maxine\\", from his 1982 50s-themed album The Nightfly, in which Fagen accompanies himself on four-part harmonies, has been described as inspired by the Four Freshmen. The Four Freshmen covered the song on their 1986 album Fresh! Awards and honors The Four Freshmen have won JazzTimes magazine's Readers Poll for Best Vocal Group multiple years. They have also won Down Beat magazine's Readers Poll for Best Vocal Group in 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1958, 2000, and 2001. They have been nominated for a Grammy Award six times.

Hawranik was first elected to the legislature in a 2002 by-election in the riding of Lac du Bonnet (following the resignation of Darren Praznik). A Progressive Conservative, Hawranik narrowly defeated New Democrat Michael Hameluck by 3398 votes to 3234. He defeated Hameluck again by a slightly wider margin in the provincial election of 2003. Hawranik maintains a personal web page, through which he has outlined his views on a variety of issues. He has spoken out in favour of reforming Canada's legal system, particularly in light of efforts by the Hells Angels to hire high-priced lawyers at public expense. He was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election. In February 2011, Hawranik announced that he would not run for reelection to the assembly later that year. Later in 2011, he moved to Alberta to join his wife who had been serving as dean of the faculty of graduate studies at Athabasca University for the previous two years.

It is the largest waterfall in the Northwestern United States by volume, and the seventeenth widest in the world. Horseshoe in shape, it is wide and high with a flow of 30,849 cu ft/s (874 m¬≥/s), located upriver from the Willamette's mouth. Until 2011 a canal and set of locks allowed vessels to pass into the main Willamette Valley. Those locks are now closed. Human history Drawing of the falls prior to development Native American legends taught that the falls were placed there by a great god so that their people would have fish to eat all winter.¬∑ Willamette Falls was once the home to the Charcowah village of the Clowewalla band of Tumwaters or Willamette Band of Tumwaters, an upper Chinookan speaking people. These lands were ceded to the United States Government under the Willamette Valley Treaty of 1855 (signed on January 22, 1855; ratified on March 3, 1855).10 Stat. 1143, also known as the \\"Treaty with the Kalapuya Etc.\\" Tribal members were then removed from these ancestral lands to the Grand Ronde ReservationEstablished by President James Buchanan's Executive Order dated June 30, 1857; printed in Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties Vol. 1 (Charles Joseph Kappler, ed.), p.886, a 60,000-acre reservation at the base of the coast range. Willamette Falls boat basin in 1867, photograph by Carleton Watkins Willamette Falls is an important location for many tribes. The abundance of salmon brought tribal members from all over to fish, trade, and interact at the falls and created an economic hub for the region. Despite the removal of natives from the area, the importance of Willamette Falls continues to this day. Each year the Grand Ronde Tribe harvests ceremonial salmon from a fishing platform at Willamette Falls and collects lamprey during the summer. Native Americans from other Tribes, such as Warm Springs, also harvest Pacific Lamprey at the falls. European fur traders became aware of the falls in 1810. John McLoughlin established a land claim at the falls in the name of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1829. Oregon City was established in 1842 near the east end of the falls. The town of Linn City was founded on the western shore one year later in 1843. The two towns competed economically, vying for the lucrative steamboat traffic and the trade it generated. With the falls representing the end of the line for boat traffic, river boat captains were forced to choose a side of the river on which they would dock to unload their passengers and goods; some of which would continue their upriver journey on winding portage toll roads. Competition between the towns was fierce until the Great Flood of 1862. Oregon City was inundated and badly damaged, but the unluckier Linn City was obliterated. Navigating past the falls was not possible until the completion of the Willamette Falls Locks in 1873. During construction of the locks, channels were blasted from the very rocks that formerly supported the town of Linn City. Along with the locks, the modern city of West Linn sits on a portion of the former town site. The locks were sold by the Willamette Falls Canal and Locks Company to the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1915. The falls in 2009 from the east with West Linn in the background =Modern history= The Willamette Falls Electric Company (later renamed Portland General Electric) was formed in 1888 to build a hydro- electric generation facility at the falls. Four turbine-driven dynamos were built on the east end of the falls. A 14-mile (23-kilometre) long transmission line to Portland was built, becoming the first long-distance transmission of electrical energy in the United States in 1889. In 1895 Portland General Electric built a second generation station on the west side of the falls. The newer plant, now called the T.W.Sullivan Plant (previously Station B), is still in operation with a capacity of 16,000 kilowatts. The foundations of the old plant still remain. The falls have been home to several paper mills beginning with the Oregon City Paper Manufacturing Co. in 1866. The Willamette Pulp and Paper Co. opened on the West Linn side during 1889. The ownership of the mills has changed several times. The last two remaining mills in 2011 were owned by the West Linn Paper Company and the Blue Heron Paper Company. West Linn Paper Company announced it was shutting down in October of 2017, and reopened in November 2019 as Willamette Falls Paper Company. Blue Heron Paper Company closed its mill in February 2011. The Blue Heron site has subsequently been auctioned off for redevelopment. The milling facilities were sold to a Canadian investment firm, NRI Global, Inc., which has begun work removing the old machinery and cleaning the grounds of contamination. An agreement for the sale of the site itself was announced in June 2013, but later fell apart. In May 2014, another developer, George Heidgerken, purchased the property. Mr. Heidgerken then sold the property to the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde in August of 2019. The industrialization of the area led to diminishing salmon and steelhead runs, prompting the construction of a fish ladder in 1882. A new fish ladder, built in 1971, is currently operated by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The estimated spring chinook salmon run for 2007 is 52,000. The industrialization has also precluded public access to the base of the waterfall for well over a century, but as of 2017 a process to redevelop the Blue Heron Paper Mill site and provide public access to the area, including a river walk, is underway. Details The falls is a horseshoe shaped block waterfall caused by a basalt shelf in the river floor. The 40 ft (12 m) high and 1500 ft (457 m) wide falls occur 26 river miles (42 km) upstream from the Willamette's confluence with the Columbia River. Operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the lock was a four lock canal and was the oldest continuous operating, multiple lift navigation canal in the United States. The public can view the falls from viewpoints on the bluffs of Oregon City, from a signed viewpoint along Highway 99E, from the Oregon City Bridge, from a viewpoint on northbound I-205, or from boats in the river.

Description The Sudan plated lizard is a medium-sized lizard that can grow up to 20-24\\" long, with the tail being less than half of total length. They have stout bodies, short limbs, and moderately broad tails. This species is easily recognised by its heavily armored appearance. The body and tail is covered in transverse bands of more or less square plate-like keeled scales, and head shields are fused to the skull. The armour makes the animals look a bit like the uncommon perception of Mesozoic reptiles. Coloration varies from tawny to grayish brown to dark brown with cream-colored spots or striping, with a pale underside. Males tend to be larger than females, and can develop bright-colored throats during breeding season. Distribution The Sudan plated lizard can be found in parts of eastern and central Africa, including the countries Tanzania (including the island archipelago of Zanzibar), Kenya and Mozambique. They prefer rocky, semi-open areas within coastal woodland, thicket, moist savannah, and dry savannah habitats. They seem to especially prefer rock piles and crevices.  Diet  Sudan plated lizards are omnivores. Although they primarily eat insects, they also occasionally eat fruits, vegetation, and small vertebrates like small lizards and rodents. Captivity Plated lizards are typically very shy, but they are docile and can tame quickly with regular handling. Individuals require a terrarium with dimensions of at least 48\\"L x 24\\"W x 24\\"H, with bedding that allows them to dig and burrow. The enclosure should offer plenty of hiding places to help them feel secure. The enclosure must have a daytime temperature of 70-85¬∞F, with a localized basking area with temperatures between 105-115¬∞F as measured by a digital probe thermometer or infrared thermometer. The enclosure should be allowed to cool down at night, but should not get colder than 60¬∞F. Sudan plated lizards should also be provided with a high quality T5 HO (desert) UVB lamp half the length of the enclosure and placed on the same side as the heat lamp. Although they are a fairly arid species, they do best when they have access to areas of higher humidity, up to 80%. Being omnivores, their diet should consistent mainly of calcium-dusted feeder insects supplemented with vegetables. Sudan plated lizards at different life stages have different feeding schedules: * Hatchlings (<6‚Äù long) ‚Äî Insects daily, plants daily * Juveniles (6-12‚Äù long) ‚Äî Insects 5 days/week, plants daily * Young adults (12-18‚Äù long) ‚Äî Insects 3 days/week, plants 4 days/week * Adults (>18‚Äù long)‚Äî Insects 2 days/week, plants 4 days/week, no food 1 day/week Sudan plated lizards will eat live crickets, dubia roaches, and other insects. For vegetation, they will take leafy greens such as collard greens, mustard greens, endive, escarole and spring mix, as well as carrots and grated sweet potato. Fruits such as mango pieces and berries can be used as treats. Citrus fruit (e.g. orange) and other acidic fruits should be avoided as this can cause stomach ulcers and digestion problems. Some keepers also treat their plated lizards with the occasional small pinkie mouse, depending on the size of the individual. A bowl of clean, fresh water should always be available.

Political career When he was first elected in 1981, Yates was the youngest member of the 22nd D√°il and is also the fifth-youngest ever member of D√°il √âireann at the age of 21. He became involved in local politics when he became a member of Wexford County Council, serving until 1995 and again from 1999 to 2004. He joined the Fine Gael front bench in 1988 and was appointed Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry when the party came to power in 1994. Yates oversaw a particularly difficult period for Irish agriculture. Farmers saw the prices they received for their produce plummet; he stopped live animal exports in response to controversy over cruelty in shipping, and took on the Irish Veterinary Union over the tuberculosis eradication scheme. He also had to deal with a sharp rise in the number of BSE cases during 1996, and the consequent banning of Irish beef by Russia. When John Bruton resigned as leader of Fine Gael in January 2001, there was much speculation that Yates would be a contender for the vacant position. Instead, he announced to his colleagues that he was leaving full- time politics to concentrate on his family and business interests and that he would not be contesting the next general election. He receives annual pension payments of ‚Ç¨74,836 from his time in politics. Business career Yates was the chairman and managing director of Celtic Bookmakers, an Irish chain of betting shops, and expanded the company from its Wexford base to a chain of 64 shops around the country at its peak. On 4 January 2011, it was announced that the company had gone into receivership. He headed a group of bookmakers in a court case against the British Horseracing Board (BHB) over fees for licences to access a racing information database in 2005. The issue was resolved in the High Court with the termination of the BHB's licence agreement and a payment of ‚Ç¨300,000 to the bookmakers, who were reported to have access to the BHB's former database until 9 January 2006. In 2011, he described the Irish bankruptcy process as \\"purgatory\\", and publicly announced that he was contemplating moving to the UK to avail of the British bankruptcy process. On 21 August 2012, the High Court in Dublin dismissed an attempt by Allied Irish Banks to have him declared bankrupt. In September 2013, it was announced that Yates was discharged from bankruptcy, having fulfilled the requirements set down by Swansea County Court, where he made his application for personal insolvency on 24 August 2012. Media work Yates co-presented the Newstalk breakfast show from 2009, firstly with Claire Byrne and subsequently with Chris Donoghue. On 23 March 2012, he announced he would be leaving both the station and his column in the Irish Examiner with effect from 6 April 2012, to concentrate on his personal finances. He also presented Tonight with Vincent Browne on TV3 during summer 2011. He returned to Newstalk in September 2013, once again co-presenting the breakfast show with Chris Donoghue. Yates is a regular conference speaker, motivational speaker and MC at business events in Ireland. He co-hosted The Tonight Show on TV3 and presented The Hard Shoulder on Newstalk until his retirement from broadcasting in July 2020. Kieran Cuddihy replaced Yates as the host of The Hard Shoulder in September 2020.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) from 1965 to 1987 and from 1989 to 1993. He served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Dublin constituency from 1979 to 1981. He was a Senator from 1987 to 1989, after being nominated by the Taoiseach. Early life O'Connell was born in Dublin, and educated at St. Vincent's C.B.S. in Glasnevin and the Royal College of Surgeons, Dublin. In 1960 he founded MIMS Ireland, a well-known monthly index of medical specialties, and in 1967 he founded the Irish Medical Times, a weekly broadsheet for doctors. Political career He began his political career when he was elected to D√°il √âireann as a Labour Party TD for Dublin South-West at the 1965 general election. He held a seat for the party until the 1981 general election, when he was expelled for refusing to stand in the Dublin West constituency. Instead, he stood as an independent in Dublin South-Central, opposing the Labour leader, Frank Cluskey. O'Connell, always a large vote-getter, easily topped the poll and Cluskey lost his D√°il seat. O'Connell was then elected as Ceann Comhairle of D√°il √âireann, and resigned from the European Parliament, to which he had been elected as an MEP for the Dublin constituency in the first direct elections in 1979. (His election to the first directly-elected European Parliament in 1979, along with running-mate Michael O'Leary, was an extraordinary achievement for the Labour Party.) He remained as Ceann Comhairle until December 1982, being returned automatically in the two elections of 1982. In 1983 he became a member of Fianna F√°il, representing the party until he lost his D√°il seat at the 1987 general election. That year he was one of those nominated by the Taoiseach Charles Haughey to the 18th Seanad √âireann, serving until he regained his D√°il seat at the 1989 general election. Following Albert Reynolds' resignation from the Cabinet, O'Connell supported him and is seen as one of those who helped persuade Haughey to resign when he did. O'Connell was appointed Minister for Health by Reynolds in 1992. He remained as Minister for Health until 1993, when owing to ill-health he resigned from the Cabinet and from the D√°il. Further controversy surrounded O'Connell's relationship with Charles Haughey in later years. It was revealed during the Moriarty Tribunal firstly that O'Connell was the middleman for donations from Arab tycoon Mahmoud Fustok to Haughey; and secondly that O'Connell had invested a significant sum in Celtic Helicopters, a business venture owned by Haughey's son Ciar√°n. In the 1970s he arranged a meeting in his home between Harold Wilson MP, then leader of the British Labour Party, and D√°ith√≠ √ì Conaill, a member of the Army Council of the Provisional IRA. Negotiations that night to broker a ceasefire were successful in the short term, but ultimately broke down.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1999 to 2005 as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party, and campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada in 2006 and 2008 as a Liberal. He is the nephew of Bill and Shirley Loewen, prominent entrepreneurs and philanthropists in Winnipeg. Early life and career Loewen was born in Elkhorn, Manitoba, and raised in Winnipeg. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Manitoba in 1973. Tall and athletic, Loewen was a prominent member of the University of Manitoba Bisons basketball team. He joined the payroll services company Comcheq Services Ltd. (now called Ceridian) in 1973. He later served as company president from 1984 until 1998. In 1993, Loewen oversaw Comcheq's transformation into a subsidiary of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC).\\"CIBC becomes leading supplier of payroll services\\", Canada NewsWire, 25 January 1993. There were concerns that the Winnipeg company's autonomy would be undermined by the national bank, but the CIBC initially allowed it to remain fairly independent.Martin Cash, \\"Comcheq flourishes on a long leash\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 March 1994. Loewen attempted to reacquire the company in 1998, but was unsuccessful.\\"Leadership hope gone up in smoke\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 February 2002, A4. Loewen has for many years been a prominent figure supporting Manitoba's sports community. He developed a plan to financially support the province's Olympic athletes in the early 1990s, and helped establish the Winnipeg Thunder basketball team in 1992 with future mayor Sam Katz.Ashley Prest, \\"Katz loses some of his thunder\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 March 1994. He has also provided financial assistance to several athletic programs. In 1994, a newspaper columnist in Winnipeg described Comcheq as \\"probably the most generous private-sector supporter of elite athletes in the province\\".Kelly Taylor, \\"Share the glory\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 April 1994. Loewen helped create the Manitoba Entertainment Complex group (MEC) in 1994, in an effort to purchase controlling shares in the Winnipeg Jets hockey franchise and keep the team in the city.David Roberts, \\"Consortium wants to buy Jets\\", Globe and Mail, 27 August 1994, A14. Loewen chaired the MEC, and participated in plans to build a new arena for the team. Despite his efforts, the Jets were forced to leave the city in 1996. Loewen argued that the National Hockey League and commissioner Gary Bettman undermined his efforts, by presenting unreasonable demands shortly before an official deadline.John Douglas, \\"'Demands outrageous', Loewen says\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 April 1995, City Page. Bettman denied this, claiming that advance notice had been given and that his conditions were necessary for creating a stable franchise. See Mary Ormsby, \\"Winnipeg group not serious, Bettman says\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 May 1995, C3. In 2006, he indicated that the major-level investors necessary for maintaining a National Hockey League franchise simply did not exist in Winnipeg in the mid-1990s.Adam Clayton, \\"Winnipeg Jets long gone but not forgotten\\", Canadian Press, 27 April 2006, 13:50 report. Loewen has been a board member and chairman of Economic Development Winnipeg, a council member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Manitoba, a board member and president of the Big Brothers and Sisters Association of Winnipeg and president of both the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra and the Linden Woods Community Association. He has also been involved with the United Way of Winnipeg, serving on the United Way Cabinet from 1994 until 1999 as Chair of the Major Corporate Division and Deputy Chair of Business. He is a founding Director of the Business Council of Manitoba. There were rumours that Loewen would run for Mayor of Winnipeg in 1998, but he declined.Kim Guttormson, \\"Thompson decides she won't seek third term in mayor's office\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 April 1998, A1. Until 2012 John Loewen was the President of Telpay, an electronic payments company which was originally started as a research and development project by Comcheq. Telpay is the largest independent payment processing company in Canada having processed over 23 million payments worth over $14 billion in 2009. Provincial politics Loewen entered political life in Manitoba's 1999 provincial election, winning election for the newly created south Winnipeg constituency of Fort Whyte. Running as a Progressive Conservative, he defeated New Democrat Bidhu Jha by 3,665 votes. The New Democratic Party won the election, and Loewen became a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in the Official Opposition. He was appointed as his party's critic for Intergovernmental Affairs, and was later promoted to Finance Critic.\\"Tory eyes on NDP\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 October 1999, A5. Considered a rising star in his party, there was some speculation that he would run to succeed Gary Filmon as party leader in 2000.\\"Possible contenders\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 November 1999, A2. He decided against this when the party establishment united behind Stuart Murray. He was a moderate in the Manitoba Progressive Conservative Party, and supported the centre-right Progressive Conservative Party of Canada rather than the right-wing Canadian Alliance at the federal level, even though many of his colleagues backed the Alliance. In 2001, Loewen was the only member of the provincial PC caucus to attend a Winnipeg fundraiser for federal PC leader Joe Clark.Helen Fallding, \\"Joe Clark - the $1,000 man Conservatives feast on Alliance follies\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 May 2001, A1. In the same year, he criticized the provincial New Democratic government of Gary Doer for not going far enough in extending rights to same-sex couples.Helen Fallding, \\"Limited gay rights bill passes second reading\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 June 2001, A3. Loewen became involved a serious controversy in early 2002, after issuing a media notice that was strongly critical of Manitoba's Crocus investment portfolio. He wrote that the company held investments \\"in a number of Manitoba companies\\" that were \\"in financial difficulty\\", and requested that the government ask the Auditor General to review the valuation of the fund. His statement was met with strong opposition from Crocus, which threatened legal action.Helen Fallding, \\"Tory comes out blazing, shoots himself in foot\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 February 2002, A1. Loewen was subsequently demoted from his position as Finance Critic by Stuart Murray, and was required to make a formal apology to the legislature in April 2002.Helen Fallding, \\"Murray flip-flops, demotes Loewen\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 February 2002, A1; Murray McNeill, \\"Loewen dodges the bullet\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 May 2002, B3. Loewen's apology prevented a defamation suit from Crocus. Almost three years later, Crocus stopped trading and was forced into receivership. Many believe Loewen's concerns were vindicated by the trust's eventual failure.\\"Murray had chance to be a hero over Crocus\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 June 2005, A15. Loewen criticized several parties, including the government, opposition and senior Crocus management, when discussing the firm's failure in a 2007 interview.Frances Russell, \\"Government cannot evade blame in Crocus affair\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 March 2007, A11. He was re-elected in the 2003 election by a slightly reduced margin. In late 2003, he introduced a bill to phase out Video Lottery Terminals from the province.Mia Rabson, \\"Phase out most VLTs, Tory urges\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 November 2003, A3. Federal politics The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada merged with the Canadian Alliance in early 2004 to create the Conservative Party of Canada. Loewen initially supported the new party, but announced on September 23, 2005 that he would seek the federal Liberal nomination for Charleswood‚ÄîSt. James‚ÄîAssiniboia in the upcoming federal election. In making the announcement, Loewen said he was uncomfortable with the social conservatism of Conservative leader Stephen Harper, and that he \\"never believed in the policies of the former Alliance and Reform parties\\" which he described as \\"dominat[ing] the [Conservative] party\\".Michelle MacAfee, \\"Federal Tory MP prepares to fight Liberal opponent plucked from his own ranks\\", Canadian Press, 23 September 2005, 16:40 report. He resigned from the provincial legislature on September 26, 2005, and subsequently beat Gennarino Conte for the Liberal nomination.Carol Sanders, \\"Candidates can't be assured of votes from ethnic groups\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 January 2006. He lost to Conservative incumbent Steven Fletcher in the 2006 federal election, as the Conservatives gained twenty-five seats to form a minority government. Loewen acknowledged that the national trend worked against his candidacy.Leah Janzen, \\"Alcock loss jolts Liberals, but Keeper keeps it even\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 January 2006, B3. After the election, Loewen returned to the board of TelPay, formerly a division of Comcheq. He is also a partner in Payworks, an internet based payroll service. As a volunteer, he is leading the fund raising efforts for construction of the North End Wellness Centre in Winnipeg.\\"Low on cash, but hopeful\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 March 2006, B5; \\"TelPay Incorporated\\", Globe and Mail, 14 August 2007, B3.

In fairy tale and legend Actual fairy godmothers are rare in fairy tales, but became familiar figures because of the popularity of the literary fairy tales of Madame d'Aulnoy and other pr√©cieuses, and Charles Perrault. Many other supernatural patrons feature in fairy tales; these include various kinds of animals and the spirit of a dead mother.Katharine Briggs, An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures, \\"Fairy godmother\\", p147. The fairy godmother has her roots in the figures of the Fates; this is especially clear in Sleeping Beauty, where they decree her fate, and are associated with spinning.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Fairy godmother\\" p 330 In the tales of pr√©cieuses and later successors, the fairy godmother acts in a manner atypical of fairies in actual folklore belief; they are preoccupied with the character and fortunes of their human protegees, whereas fairies in folklore had their own interests.K.M. Briggs The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature. p.177 Chicago, University of Chicago Press. 1967 Typically, the fairy godmother's prot√©g√© is a prince or princess and the hero of the story, and the godparent uses her magic to help or otherwise support them. The most well-known example is probably the fairy godmother in Charles Perrault's Cinderella. Eight fairy godmothers appear in Sleeping Beauty, of Charles Perrault's and in the Grimm Brothers' version titled Little Briar Rose the thirteen so-called godmothers are called Wise Women. The popularity of these versions of these tales led to this being widely regarded as a common fairy- tale motif, although they are less common in other tales. Indeed, the fairy godmothers were added to The Sleeping Beauty by Perrault; no such figures appeared in his source, \\"Sole, Luna, e Talia\\" by Giambattista Basile.Jane Yolen, p 23, Touch Magic A great variety of other figures may also take this place. She is portrayed as kind, gentle and loving. Pr√©cieuses In the works of the pr√©cieuses, French literary fairy tales, fairy godmothers act much as actual godmothers did among their social circles, exerting their benefits for their godchildren, but expecting respect in return. Madame d'Aulnoy created a fairy godmother for the evil stepsister in her fairy tale The Blue Bird; in this position, the fairy godmother's attempts to bring about the marriage of her goddaughter and the hero are evil attempts to impede his marriage with the heroine. Likewise, in her The White Doe, the fairy godmother helps the evil princess get revenge on the heroine. In Finette Cendron, the fairy godmother is the heroine's, but after helping her in the early portion of the tale, she is offended when Finette Cendron does not take her advice, and Finette must work through the second part with little assistance from her. In Henriette-Julie de Murat's Bearskin, the heroine has a fairy godmother, but she is offended that the heroine's marriage was arranged without consulting her, and refuses to assist. In fiction Illustration to Cinderella by Gustave Dor√©: the fairy godmother preparing an enchantment for her goddaughter. Fairy godmothers appear frequently in fairytale fantasy, especially comic versions and retellings of Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. Mercedes Lackey presents a gently lampooned version of the concept in her Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms series, in which Fairy Godmothers are magically-gifted women who monitor magical forces across the kingdoms. Whenever events are right for a fairy tale to recur, the relevant Fairy Godmother steps in to make sure that the tale in question runs its course with as few fatalities as possible. * In William Makepeace Thackeray's The Rose and the Ring, the fairy Blackstick concludes that her gifts have not done her godchildren good; in particular, she has given two of her goddaughters the title ring and the title rose, which have the power to make whoever owns them beautiful, which have ruined the character of those goddaughters; with the next prince and princess, she gives them \\"a little misfortune\\", which proves the best gift, as their difficulties form their characters.Stephen Prickett, Victorian Fantasy p 69-70 * In C. S. Lewis's The Magician's Nephew, when Uncle Andrew explains how he made the magical rings from dust left to him by his godmother, he points out that she may have had fairy blood, and so he might have been the last man to have a fairy godmother.Janice Daurio, \\"Is It Good to be Bad?\\" p 123 Gregory Bassham ed. and Jerry L.

She is a conniving, crooked businesswoman (with a personality rather like that of the Stepmother in Cinderella), who is quite willing to resort to blackmail and/or murder to further her own interests. The pure reason for helping princesses gain a happily ever after with Prince Charming is the fact that Prince Charming is actually the Fairy Godmother's son, and through the marriage he will gain the throne. * The Discworld novel Witches Abroad also features a plotting fairy godmother, Lady Lilith de Tempscire, who uses the power of stories to control the city of Genua.

Prospect Bluff Historic Sites (until 2016 known as Fort Gadsden Historic Site, and sometimes written as Fort Gadsden Historic Memorial) is located in Franklin County, Florida, on the Apalachicola River, SW of Sumatra, Florida. The site contains the ruins of two forts ‚Äì the earlier \\"Negro Fort\\", which was constructed by the British in 1814. The British allowed fugitive slaves and Creek tribesmen that had taken refuge with them to occupy it after they evacuated Florida, but the fort was destroyed in an attack from U.S. forces in 1816 including a barrage of cannonballs from gunboats. Fort Gadsden was built in 1818 within the former walls of Negro Fort. The site has been known by several other names at various times, including Prospect Bluff, British post,Life of Andrew Jackson. James Parton, Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1880. p. 393. Nicholls' Fort, Blount's Fort, Fort Blount, African Fort, and Fort Apalachicola. Listed in the National Register of Historic Places, the Prospect Bluff Historic Sites is located in the Apalachicola National Forest and is managed by the U.S. Forest Service. The process of memorializing the site began in 1961, when Florida acquired a parcel of including the site. Ownership was later transferred to the federal government and it was named a National Historic Landmark in 1972.British Fort at National Historic Landmarks Program The site contains an explanatory kiosk with artifacts, picnic area with pavilion, grills, and rest rooms. There are four historic markers: Fort Gadsden, British Fort Magazine, Steamship Tragedy, and \\"Millie Francis\\". There is no marker for the Negro Fort.  Prospect Bluff The site of both Negro Fort and the later Fort Gadsden was Prospect Bluff, \\"a fine bluff overlooking the Apalachicola River,\\" whose modest elevation of and the swamp that almost surrounded it (description below) gave it a natural military strength. The name parallels the Spanish one, Loma de Buena Vista, literally \\"hill with a good view\\". Accessible only by river then, the site was and is still remote. The river was the boundary between East Florida and West Florida during the second period (1783‚Äì1821) of Spanish Florida, by modern land route from Pensacola and from St. Augustine. The area was sparsely populated, and in the twentieth century a large portion became the Apalachicola National Forest. The river was of intense interest to the British, who saw it as an undefended entry into the United States through Georgia. It was of no interest to the Spaniards; it led nowhere they cared about. Spanish forces in Florida were limited and Spain was far less committed to Florida than it was to its other colonies, most of them far more productive. Spain's inability to police its borders or return fugitive slaves was central to Florida's transfer to the United States in 1821. Control of Prospect Bluff meant control of the river, which had served as a transportation artery for centuries. More recently, it had enabled raiding parties to go upriver into Georgia and the Mississippi Territory via the Chattahoochee and especially the Flint River. The attacks were made on plantations, which had few if any defenses. These parties, besides coming back with material goods, saw to it that the slaves of the raided plantations could get free. This was a great economic blow to the slave owners (slaves were expensive), and an ideological affront as well, leaving them insecure and angry. Prospect Bluff was valuable militarily not only because of the elevation its name suggests, but because it was at a \\"strategic location\\", a bend in the river, giving an important sight advantage over any boat.  Before 1814 The Florida panhandle was mostly wilderness before 1814. Its population at the time is unknown, except for isolated reports. As in the rest of Florida, there were many Native American refugees from the United States, who merged into a new ethnicity, Seminoles. It provided excellent cover for escaped slaves, who, since they shared a common enemy, got along with the Seminoles fairly well; \\"over time, a bond developed between escaped Africans and the Seminoles that only increased with time and white pressure for their return\\". Some became black Seminoles. There was \\"reciprocal respect and affection\\"; the former slaves, who knew English, served as interpreters. This predecessor of the Underground Railroad ran south. The biggest issue about the area discussed by whites was how to get escaped slaves back, or get compensation for them, and prevent or reduce future escapes. The return of Native Americans was unwanted, and they were soon forcibly removed from Florida as well. As was customary in pre-railroad times, settlement took place first along rivers. The name Apalachicola derives from the Apalachee who settled along it in pre-colonial times. Settlement at Prospect Bluff by maroons (escaped slaves and their descendants), Seminoles, and a few Europeans is documented at the end of the eighteenth century. In January 1783 a conference was held in St. Augustine between the representatives of the British Crown‚ÄîGovernor Patrick Tonyn, Brigadier General Archibald McArthur, and Thomas Brown, the superintendent of Indian affairs‚Äîand the head men and principal warriors of the towns of the Upper and the Lower Creeks, who complained of the long distance they must travel to the stores from which they obtained their supplies. The Indians offered protection to merchants who would move their stores to locations closer to their territory, and pointed out the Apalachicola River as a suitable place for a trading house. The Creeks said it was not only more convenient for themselves, but also much nearer to the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Cherokee Indians, and requested that the house of Panton, Leslie & Company, who had been supplying them with goods, should be solicited to settle there for that purpose. William Panton was present at the conference, and agreed with the Indians to establish a store at such a place as he or his co-partners might find suitable between the forks of Flint river and the mouth of the Apalachicola River, provided that letters of license were issued to him and his partners. The agreement was confirmed by the Crown, and the traders were granted the necessary license. Their store opened in 1784, by which time Spain had regained possession of Florida, at Fort San Marcos de Apalache (modern St. Marks, Florida). This store was attacked and looted by the adventurer William Augustus Bowles in 1792 and again in 1800, at which point it ceased operations. A trading post run by John Forbes and Company, successors to Panton, Leslie & Company, was set up in 1804 at the more defensible Prospect Bluff at the request of \\"Indians\\" (\\"Mickosuckees\\" is the only ethnicity mentioned). It was \\"manned by Edmund Doyle with some assistance from William Hambly, an Indian trader with years of experience in the area.\\" Both \\"owned plantations higher up the river, at Spanish Bluff on the west bank and near present-day Bristol.\\" The site of the trading post was inside the walls of the Fort, built around it; this explains why the precise site has never been identified. (Cox, without citing any evidence, says the Fort was \\"adjacent\\" to the store.) It included a building for storing hides (what the Native Americans had to trade), quarters for negro slaves, and a cow pen for several hundred cattle that were raised nearby. During the War of 1812, British troops looted the store and freed the slaves. Figures on the number of black fugitives who settled in the surrounding area range from 300 to 1,000. The blacks developed plantations extending up to 50 miles along the river. A report from 1812 mentions over 36 cleared acres and 1,200 cattle, and they lived in \\"large and well-built cabins\\". Their crops were peas, beans, corn, and rice.  British post (1814‚Äì15)  The British launched an invasion of Pensacola during the War of 1812 and occupied it until General Andrew Jackson took the town on November 7, 1814. The British forces, over 100 officers and men led by a Brevet Captain of the Royal Marines, George Woodbine, made camp at the only community between Pensacola and St. Marks: the trading post of John Forbes and Company, surrounded by negro plantations. It was located at Prospect Bluff. Woodbine began to train local Native Americans as well as escaped slaves. Nicolls recruited the ex-slaves into the new (black) Corps of Colonial Marines. They were well-armed, well-equipped, and underwent drills; many had been in training for months. He also assembled and trained more than five hundred Creek and Seminole Indians by February 1815, but they came from a different culture, did not like being trained, and did not have the incentive of being protected from American re-enslavement. Nicolls found the ex-slaves superior as soldiers, reporting that his black recruits had enlisted \\"with the strictest good faith and conduct, so much so, that out of 1,500 of them I never had occasion to punish one of them\\". He added that in contrast with British soldiers, \\"they would not get drunk\\". They were preparing to attack Georgia when news arrived of the end of the war. The British paid off the Colonial Marines (at the same rate as the white Marines) and withdrew from Florida. Blacks and Native Americans under Nicolls' direction built two forts on the Apalachicola River. THe larger and more important one was to be on the border of Georgia, at the juncture of the Flint and the Chattahoochee Rivers, in modern Chattahoochee, Florida, and was to serve as the base for a U.S. invasion. Time only permitted the construction of a small wooden structure, which Nicolls called Fort Apalachicola, but is today referred to as Nicolls' Outpost. The larger one, which actually was built and was intended to be a supply depot for Nicolls' Outpost, did not have a name at first; it was referred to simply as the British post. It was above the river mouth and south of Nicolls' Outpost and the border of Georgia. The construction of the larger fort was described by Brigadier General Edmund P. Gaines in a letter of May 14, 1816 to Andrew Jackson, who had charged him with destroying the Fort: > The ramparts and parapets built of hewn timber filled in with earth, > mounting 9 to 12 pieces of Cannon, several of which are very large, with > some mortars and Howitzers. It has a deep ditch intended to be filled with > water, but was dry when seen by my informants, two or three months ago. The > work is nearly square and extends over near two acres [0.81 ha] of ground, > has Comfortable barracks, and large stone houses inside. It is rendered > inaccessible by land, except a narrow pass up near the margin of the river, > by reason of an impenetrable swamp in the rear and extending to the river > above. The fort was very well provided with ordnance: > It included 4 twenty-four-pound cannons, 4 six-pound cannons, beside a field > piece and a howitzer. In addition there were found 2,500 stands of muskets > with accoutrements, 500 carbines and 500 swords ... 300 quarter-casks of > rifle powder and 162 barrels of cannon powder, besides other stores and > clothing. The area enclosed by the fort was ; on the eastern corners (those most vulnerable to attack) were bastions with walls high and thick. The magazine area of the fort was located about 500 feet from the river bank, and consisted of an octagonal earthwork holding the principal magazine. This was surrounded by an extensive rectangular enclosure covering about seven acres with bastions on the eastern corners having parapets 15 feet high and 18 feet thick. Gaines estimated that 900 Native American warriors and 450 armed blacks inhabited the fort.American State Papers: Foreign Relations: Volume 4, pg 552 Letter from General Gaines dated May 22, 1815 'P.S. I learn that Nicholls ..is still at Appalachicola , and that he has 900 Indians and 450 negroes under arms'ADM 1/508 Letter from Admiral Cochrane to General Lambert dated February 3, 1815 'a coloured corps has been organised of from 300-400 men ... number of indians amounts to nearly 3000 men'. A miniature replica of the British post was constructed in the 1970s; a picture is in the State Archives of Florida. Negro Fort (1815‚Äì16) When the British withdrew, they deliberately left all their weapons, hoping that the locals would use them to defend themselves from U.S. attempts to re-enslave them, just as African and Native Americans had assisted the British during the American War of Independence. Some of the Native Americans (Seminoles and Red Stick Creeks) left; they had more options than the escaped slaves because there were Native American communities in Florida they could go to; there was no other community of maroons closer than Angola, Florida. Some remained, along with many of the trained soldiers of the disbanded Corps of Colonial Marines, which was a British Army regiment consisting of freed slaves. Over the next year the fort became a growing colony of escaped slaves from Georgia and the Mississippi Territory, and became known as the Negro Fort. American State Papers: Foreign Relations: Volume 4, pg 551 has the testimony of a Royal Marine deserter from the Fort, sworn at Mobile on May 9, 1815, advising: 'the British left, with the Indians, between them three and four hundred negroes, taken from the United States, principally Louisiana' It was the center of the largest community of free negroes in North America before the U.S. Civil War. The fort, located as it was near the border, was seen by the U.S. as \\"a beacon of light to restless and rebellious slaves,\\" \\"a center of hostility and above all a threat to the security of their slaves,\\"Mahon, History of the Second Seminole War, pg. 23. \\"a direct threat to the slave-holding interests rapidly flocking to the newly opened lands in what is today Mississippi and Alabama.\\" On April 8, 1816, General Jackson ordered General Gaines to \\"take care of the situation\\", because the Fort \\"ought to be blown up\\"; it was only fomenting \\"rapine and plunder\\", and he should \\"return the stolen Negros and plunder to their rightful owners\\". Having done so, on April 23 he then complained to the West Florida military governor Mauricio de Z√∫√±iga, asking > whether that fort has been built by the government of Spain ‚Äî and whether > the negroes, who garrison it, are considered subjects of his Catholic > Majesty ‚Äî and if not by the authority of Spain ‚Äî by whom, under whose > orders, has it been established[?] He informed Z√∫√±iga that: > Secret practices to inveigle Negroes from the frontier citizens of Georgia > as well as from the Cherokee and Creek nations of Indians are still > continued by this Banditti [sic; he means the garrison] and the Hostile > Creeks. This is a state of things which cannot fail to produce much injury > to the neighboring settlements and incite Irritations which may ultimately > endanger the peace of the nation and interrupt that good understanding that > so happily exists between our governments. He insisted on the \\"return to our citizens and the friendly Indians inhabiting our Territory those Negroes now in the said fort and which have been stolen and enticed from them.\\" This conduct \\"will not be tolerated by our government and if not put down by the Spanish Authority will compel us in self Defence to destroy them.\\" After Z√∫√±iga's reply of May 26, 1816, informing Jackson that he could not act \\"unless I receive the Orders of my Captain General [in Cuba] and the necessary Supplies\\", Jackson proceeded with his plans to destroy the Fort. The first step was the construction of Fort Scott, located at a key military point upriver, the west bank of the Flint River where it empties into the Apalachicola, in the southwestern corner of Georgia. Boats supplying Fort Scott had to go up the Apalachicola River and past the Negro Fort. The supply boats were escorted by two gunboats. \\"Gaines obviously wanted to provoke an attack to justify the stronghold's destruction.\\" When shots were fired from the Fort at passing boats, this was all the excuse for action Gaines needed. On July 27, 1816, a \\"hot shot\\" (a cannonball heated to a red glow in the gunboat's galley) from the American forces entered the opening to the fort's powder magazine, igniting an explosion that was heard more than 100 miles (160 km) away in Pensacola, and destroyed the fort, killing all but 30 of 300 occupants.Aptheker, 259. It has been called \\"the single deadliest cannon shot in American history.\\" It was also \\"the largest battle in history between fugitive slaves and U.S. forces seeking to reenslave them.\\" Spain protested the violation of its soil, but according to historian John K. Mahon, it \\"lacked the power to do more.\\"Mahon, 23-24. A commemorative plaque at the scene reads as follows: > BRITISH FORT MAGAZINE It is hard to imagine the horrible scene that greeted > the first Americans to stand here on the morning of July 27, 1816. The > remains of 230 persons killed in the magazine explosion lay scattered about. > They also found an arsenal of ten cannons, 2,500 muskets and over 150 > barrels of black powder. Some original timbers from the octagonal magazine > were uncovered here by excavations. The trading post of John Forbes and Company, storekeeper Edward Doyle, was reestablished following the destruction of the fort. Fort Gadsden (1818‚Äì21) To secure the militarily significant Prospect Bluff, protect commerce on the river, prevent the rebuilding or reestablishment of the Negro Fort, and as a base for his further invasion of Florida, in 1818 General Jackson directed Lieutenant James Gadsden, of the Army Corps of Engineers, to rebuild the fort, which he did within the earthworks that had protected Negro Fort, as it was much smaller. The fort needed a new name; Jackson named it Fort Gadsden.Mohlenbrock, Robert. This Land: A Guide to Eastern National Forests. University of California Press, 2006. However, an aide to General Andrew Jackson reported to his superior in August 1818 that Fort Gadsden was \\"a temporary work, hastily erected, and of perishable materials, without constant repair, it could not last more than four or five years.\\" It was abandoned in 1821, the year Florida became a U.S. territory and there was no longer a national border to defend. Fort Gadsden had no direct involvement in any military endeavor, either in 1818‚Äì1821 or during the Civil War. \\"Milly Francis\\" A marker at the site recalls the case of Milly Francis, a Creek girl who persuaded her father, Hillis Hadjo (Francis the Prophet), not to execute an American soldier who had inadvertently come into their territory. Her father was captured and hung at Fort St. Marks in 1818. She witnessed his hanging. Irvington remains A steamboat, the Irvington, burned and sank in 1838 four miles north of the Site. The rusting boilers and some of the works thought to be from this ship were dredged from the river (when the river was being dredged for navigation) and can be seen at the Site. Civil War (1862‚Äì1863) During the American Civil War, Confederate troops occupied the fort, using it to protect communications from plantations in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama with the port of Apalachicola. In July 1863, an outbreak of malaria forced its abandonment.Kramer, Joyce. River Rover Chronicles 2. Balboa Press, 2015 Fort Gadsden given disproportionate emphasis at historic site? \\"The settlement of former slaves has been marginalized in and has largely receded from both the scholarly and popular imagination for much of the last [20th] century.\\"‚Üê The most important moment in Prospect Bluff's history is likely the Negro Fort period (1815‚Äì1816). However, the site was initially named for Fort Gadsden, arguably much less significant historically. The Fort Gadsden Historic Site was created in 1961, when racial divisions may have led to downplaying the battle, although other causes such as population displacement may have contributed as well. The 2016 renaming of the site as Prospect Bluff Historic Sites does acknowledge in the name that more than Fort Gadsden existed there. Bicentennial activities *On May 16‚Äì20, 2016, the National Park Service held a workshop with 50 participants on using technological tools to non-destructively investigate below a site's surface. The results have not yet (2018) been published, but some conclusions have been described as \\"startling\\". *On October 22, 2016, the United States Forest Service celebrated 200 years since the events of 1816.

For most of the 1960s, Murry also worked as a music publisher for the band. After the Beach Boys dismissed Murry as their manager in 1964, he produced the sound-alike group the Sunrays, and recorded a solo album, The Many Moods of Murry Wilson (1967). In 1969, Wilson sold off the Beach Boys' publishing company Sea of Tunes for $700,000 (equivalent to $ in ), then considered an undervalued sum. In 1973, he died aged 55 of a heart attack. Early years Murry Gage Wilson was born in Hutchinson, Kansas, the son of Edith Sophia (n√©e Sthole) and William Coral Wilson. His mother was of Swedish descent. His family moved west to Los Angeles when he was five. The family was initially so impoverished that they camped in a tent on the beach when they arrived. He met his future wife, Audree Neva Korthof, while attending Washington High School; they were married on March 26, 1938. Wilson had a blue-collar background. As a young man, he worked at Southern California Gas Company until the birth of his first son Brian, after which he took a job as a foreman at a Goodyear Tire & Rubber factory, where he lost an eye in an industrial accident. During this period he began writing songs. His biggest success came later with a dance song, \\"Two- Step Side-Step\\", which was featured by Lawrence Welk on his radio program in 1952 and covered on record by RCA Victor Western Swing artist Johnnie Lee Wills, as well as country music singer Bonnie Lou. He also wrote \\"I'll Hide My Tears\\", recorded in the early 1950s by doo-wop group the Jets, a reconfiguration of the Hollywood Flames. Brian stated in 2005 that people often mislabel Murry as an untalented songwriter, but \\"[he] had talent, he sure did. He was a talented man. He had some music in him ... My favorite song of his was one called 'His Little Darling and You'. It was a ballad.\\" Murry later founded a machining business, but maintained an active interest in music, which he passed along to his sons, encouraging them to learn to sing and play instruments. The Wilson brothers had a problematic relationship with their father. Many stories of abuse have surfaced, including a supposed incident where Murry hit Brian in the head with a 2√ó4, resulting in the permanent loss of hearing in his right ear. Murry denied such reports when approached by Rolling Stone in 1971. According to biographer David Leaf, Murry then \\"telephoned Brian and angrily demanded that he retract the stories. Brian reportedly laughingly told his dad, 'I'll tell you what. Let's tell them that I shit in your ear, and you hit me in the head with a plate.\\" Managing the Beach Boys The Beach Boys, 1964 After the Beach Boys' formation, Murry became the group's business manager, co-producer, and publisher in the early part of their career. Known as a domineering and manipulative man, Murry was a tough negotiator on the band's behalf, organizing a contract signing with Capitol Records. Around June 1962, Murry and Brian established the music publishing company Sea of Tunes to safeguard Brian's compositions. The Beach Boys' first few records credited Capitol A&R; director Nik Venet as producer. After April 1963, Capitol allowed Brian to produce their records himself, following Murry's insistence. Murry accompanied the group on their first Australasian tour in January 1964, and required that the band not fraternize with women, use profanity, or drink alcoholic beverages. During his early years, Wilson charged the group $100 for breaking these requirements, but for this tour, he raised the fine to $1,000, which he would subtract from the touring proceeds. At the time, Wilson's influence on the Beach Boys ignited tensions within the group. In early April 1964, following incidents involving the recording sessions of the singles \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\" and \\"I Get Around\\", Brian relieved his father of his managerial duties. In 1966, Brian reflected, \\"We love the family thing ‚Äì y'know: three brothers, a cousin and a friend is a really beautiful way to have a group ‚Äì but the extra generation can become a hang-up.\\" In Carl's recollection, \\"I remember having a conversation with my dad in his bedroom at home. I said, 'They really don't want you to manage the group anymore.' When I think about it, that must have really crushed him. After all, he gave up his home and business for us. He was kind of crackers over us.\\" Later years Even after Murry's formal business relationship with the Beach Boys ended, he remained in close contact with the group, letting Brian know his thoughts about the band's decisions. Brian also periodically sought advice from his father. In 1964, Murry sold off his machinery business and separated from Audree. Although their marriage ended in divorce in 1966, they remained closely involved with each other until his death. After he was relieved as the Beach Boys' manager, Wilson produced and managed the Sunrays In June 1964, Murry produced three tracks for David Marks' group the Marksmen: \\"Car Party\\", \\"Casanova\\", and \\"Leaves\\". During the mid-1960s, Murry produced and managed the Sunrays, a group comprising five students who attended Hollywood Professional High School. The Sunrays earned some media attention and a bit of airplay for their initial singles, but never broke into the national Top 40. Their two best-known singles, \\"I Live for the Sun\\" and \\"Andrea\\", were regional hits in California. Members of the Sunrays described Murry as \\"the [nicest] man ever\\" and denied seeing any abuse from him toward the Beach Boys. For the Beach Boys' 1965 album Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!), Brian wrote a novelty song inspired by his father: \\"I'm Bugged at My Ol' Man\\". In July, Murry sent a letter to Brian requesting that he be officially granted sole ownership of Sea of Tunes, per a verbal agreement they had reached in 1962. According to historian Keith Badman, \\"Brian allowed Murry to take total control to stop his father's continual hassling on the matter.\\" In 1966, the Beach Boys released the album Pet Sounds. Murry later praised the album, calling it a \\"masterpiece of accomplishment for Brian\\", and believed that it had become a ubiquitous influence on the music heard in product commercials. In October 1967, Capitol released Murry's The Many Moods of Murry Wilson. While promoting the album in Britain, he told Disc & Music Echo that \\"after 'Good Vibrations' Brian lost a lot of confidence. He didn't think he could ever write anything as good as that again ... With [my] LP I'm going to nudge my boys' competitive spirit.\\" In early 1969, he co-wrote the Beach Boys' song \\"Break Away\\" with Brian, and was credited under the pseudonym \\"Reggie Dunbar\\" on the record, which was released without much commercial success. In October, he returned to the studio to work on various productions, including a song titled \\"Gonna Be Alright\\". In late 1969, Murry sold Sea of Tunes, over the band's objections, for the undervalued amount of $700,000 (equivalent to $ in ). In the early 1990s, the catalog was estimated to be worth between $20 million ($ in ) and $40 million ($ in ). Brian later suggested that his signature was forged by his father on several related business documents, making the sale illegal. In April 1970, Murry assembled a tape comprising songs that he had recorded at Sunset Sound Recorders called \\"So Much in Love\\" and \\"Love to Be Your Lover\\". The tape begins with a spoken interlude in which Wilson suggests the Beach Boys should record these songs, as he \\"doesn't have long to live\\". In August 1971, Wilson cut a song he wrote called \\"Won't You Tell Me\\". The Sunrays released their version of the song on the 1996 compilation For Collectors Only: Vintage Rays. A version featuring Brian and Carl on lead vocals remains unreleased. On September 11, Disc & Music Echo reported that Dennis had permanently left the Beach Boys was in the process of \\"setting up a production and publication company with his father\\". In 1972, Murry worked on various songs, including one called \\"Take Back the Time\\". In October, he recorded a commercial jingle that he intended to offer to the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant chain. Death and legacy During his final years, Murry regularly socialized with Dennis. Audree recalled, \\"They were buddies. It's the most amazing thing ... Dennis called his father on Mother's Day and Murry told him, 'I'm just going to live about a month.' Dennis didn't tell me this, thank God! I didn't need to know that, but he could tell Dennis that.\\" On June 4, 1973, Murry died at his home in Whittier, California after suffering a heart attack at the age of 55. Brian and Dennis did not attend the funeral, but Dennis visited Murry's body in the morgue. Murry was buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California. Shortly after Murry's death, Brian told an interviewer that he was planning to record Murry's song \\"Lazaloo\\". It was also reported that Brian wrote a song, \\"Just an Imitation\\", as a tribute to his father. As of 2014, a tape of the song had yet to surface. In a 2004 interview, Brian recalled of his father, \\"He was the one who got us going. He didn't make us better artists or musicians, but he gave us ambition. I'm pleased he pushed us, because it was such a relief to know there was someone as strong as my dad to keep things going. He used to spank us, and it hurt too, but I loved him because he was a great musician.\\" In his 2016 memoir, Mike Love wrote that Murry was \\"a driving force in the Beach Boys‚Äô early success, but his greed and vindictiveness deny him any tribute. The most forgiving thing I can say about him is that he was simply an inheritor of his own father‚Äôs cruelty.\\" Engineer Chuck Britz said of Murry: \\"I was one of the few people who liked Murry. I always did. I admired him for the way he got the kids mad at him; that made them also conscious of what they were trying to achieve. I realize that maybe he did it the wrong way, but at the same time, he did make them work as a team which was the way it should be.\\" Band promoter and co-manager Fred Vail said, Murry was portrayed in two television movies: in 1990's Summer Dreams: The Story of the Beach Boys, by Arlen Dean Snyder, and in 2000's The Beach Boys: An American Family, by Kevin Dunn. In the 2014 biopic Love & Mercy, Murry is portrayed by Bill Camp.

The bar consists of a layered crispy peanut butter core covered in chocolate. History Butterfinger was invented by Otto Schnering in 1923. Schnering had founded the Curtiss Candy Company near Chicago, Illinois, in 1922. The company held a public contest to choose the name of this candy. In an early marketing campaign, the company dropped Butterfinger and Baby Ruth candy bars from airplanes in cities across the United States as a publicity stunt that helped increase its popularity. The candy bar also was promoted in Baby Take a Bow, a film from 1934 featuring Shirley Temple. In 1964, Standard Brands, Inc., purchased the Curtiss Candy Company. It then merged with Nabisco in 1981. RJR Nabisco was formed in 1985 by the merger of Nabisco Brands and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. In December 1988, RJR Nabisco was purchased by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in what was at the time, the largest leveraged buyout in history. In February 1990, Nestl√©, a Swiss multinational food and beverage company, bought Baby Ruth and Butterfinger from RJR Nabisco. When measured by revenues, Nestl√© is considered the largest food company in the world.\\"Nestl√©'s Brabeck: We have a \\"huge advantage\\" over big pharma in creating medical foods\\", CNN Money, 1 April 2011\\"Nestl√©: The unrepentant chocolatier\\", The Economist, 29 October 2009. Retrieved 17 May 2012 From 1988 to 2001, Butterfinger advertisements featuring The Simpsons, in their Tracey Ullman Show era, began to be marketed. They were immediately popular and boosted the franchise's popularity. In 1992, The Simpsons began to appear in Butterfinger BB's commercials. The Simpsons- Butterfinger marketing was phased out by 2001, but brought back in 2010. Butterfinger was withdrawn from the market in Germany in 1999, because of consumer rejection when it was one of the first products to be identified as containing genetically modified ingredients (GMOs) from corn. Butterfinger sales ended after a successful campaign by Greenpeace pushed Nestl√© to remove the product from German supermarkets. With sales in 2010 of $598 million, Butterfinger had become increasingly popular and was typically ranked as the eleventh most popular candy bar sold in the $17.68 billion United States chocolate confectionery market between 2007 and 2010. In January 2018, Nestl√© announced plans to sell over twenty of its confectionery brands of the United States (including Butterfinger) to chocolatier of Italy, Ferrero SpA, for $2.8 billion. This deal was finalized in March 2018, and the newly acquired brands were folded into the operations of the Ferrara Candy Company. Recipe change Ferrara reformulated the Butterfinger in January 2019, with labels displaying \\"Improved Recipe\\". \\"Better\\" Butterfinger, as it is identified in advertising, uses larger runner peanuts in the bar's core that are roasted at the manufacturing plant. The new bar also uses a higher percentage of cocoa and milk in the chocolate coating and cuts ingredients such as the preservative TBHQ and hydrogenated oils. The package itself has also been upgraded to avoid spoilage. Despite representatives of the brand claiming sales have \\"significantly improved with the new recipe, specifically after posting a double digit sales decline prior to the brand revamp\\", some social media users have criticized the new recipe and consider it inferior to the previous recipe. Advertising campaigns Butterfinger campaigns include counting down the end of the world or BARmageddon, with evidence such as the first ever, QR shaped crop circle in Kansas, a Butterfinger comedy-horror movie called ‚ÄúButterfinger the 13th,‚Äù the first interactive digital graphic novel by a candy brand starring the Butterfinger Defense League, and several attention grabbing April Fool's Day pranks, including the renaming of the candy bar to ‚ÄúThe Finger.‚Äù On April 1, 2008, Nestl√© launched an April Fool's Day prank in which they claimed that they had changed the name of the candy bar to \\"The Finger\\", citing consumer research that indicated that the original brand was \\"clumsy\\" and \\"awkward\\". The prank included a fake website promoting the change that featured a video press release. When the joke was revealed, the website redirected visitors to the fictitious \\"Butterfinger Comedy Network\\". In 2009, a new advertisement for Butterfinger was produced that appeared to be a homage to the earlier The Simpsons commercials. In February 2010, Butterfinger revived its \\"Nobody better lay a finger...\\" slogan as \\"Nobody's gonna lay a finger on my Butterfinger.\\"Butterfinger Ad Brings Back Slogan A comedy horror film entitled Butterfinger The 13th, was made to promote the product in October 2011. In April 2013, an official announcement via the Twitter account of The Simpsons stated that the \\"Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger\\" advertising campaign featuring Bart Simpson would be returning. In the opening sequence of \\"Treehouse of Horror XXVIII\\" (2017), the family appeared as candy in a bowl. Bart, a Butterfinger bar, tells his mother he is scared, and she comforts him by stating he's always the last taken.

There's so many relatively cheap editing software programs about that I reckon we could see some very interesting takes on the film. I like the idea that there would be all these subjective interpretations of Kubricks in the ether. We'll have to try and work out the bandwidth logistics as the files are huge.

He was a delegate from North Carolina to the Continental Congress in 1787. Between 1783 and 1815, the North Carolina General Assembly elected him to 13 one-year terms on the Council of State, which at the time was an official advisory panel that the legislature used to check the governor's power. Early life and career Robert Burton was born in Goochland County, Colony of Virginia on October 20, 1747. He was the son of Tabitha Minge and Hutchings Burton and may also have been the grandson of Noel Burton, barrister of Henrico County, Virginia. He moved to Granville County, North Carolina in about 1775 where he married Agatha Williams, daughter of Judge John Williams.

The peninsula separates the Pacific Ocean from Bristol Bay, an arm of the Bering Sea. In literature (especially Russian) the term ‚ÄòAlaska Peninsula‚Äô was used to denote the entire northwestern protrusion of the North American continent, or all of what is now the state of Alaska, exclusive of its panhandle and islands. The Lake and Peninsula borough, the Alaskan equivalent of a county, is named after the peninsula. Geography The Aleutian Range is a highly active volcanic mountain range which runs along the entire length of the Peninsula. Within it lie Wildlife Refuges, including the Katmai National Park and Preserve, the Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve and the Becharof National Wildlife Refuge, the Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife Refuge, and the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. The most active volcano along the volcanic mountain range is Pavlof Volcano which is more than 2,515 meters (8,251 feet). The southern side of the Alaska Peninsula is rugged and mountainous, created by the uplifting tectonic activity of the North Pacific Plate subsiding under a western section of the North American Plate; the northern side is generally flat and marshy, a result of millennia of erosion and general seismic stability. The northern and southern shores are likewise quite different. The northern Bristol Bay coastal side is generally turbid and muddy, experiences tidal extremes, and is relatively shallow; the Pacific side, which is also known as the \\"ring of fire,\\" has relatively small tidal activity and the water is deep and clear. Administration All of the Peninsula is organized as a part of four adjacent boroughs; the Aleutians East Borough, Bristol Bay Borough, Kodiak Island Borough, and Lake and Peninsula Borough. The Lake and Peninsula Borough includes most of the peninsula's territory. Climate Average annual precipitation ranges from . Coastal areas are subject to intense storms, wind, and rain. Winter temperatures average between , and in summer between . Frosts can occur any day of the year at higher elevations. The climate can be compared to that of parts of Scotland, the Aleutian Islands, Iceland, and Tierra del Fuego. Flora and fauna The Alaska Peninsula is home to some of the largest populations of native and undisturbed wildlife in the United States. Besides the famous McNeil River and Katmai Alaskan brown bear populations, large herds of caribou, moose, wolves waterfowl, and willow ptarmigan inhabit the area. The bears of the peninsula and Bristol Bay are so numerous because they feed on the world's largest sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) runs, which occur here in large part because the many large lakes of the peninsula are an important element in their lifecycle. These salmon, after returning from their short time at sea, swim into the lakes and their contributing streams to spawn. Their offspring, or fry, overwinter in the deep and food-abundant depths of these lakes until their migration to the sea in one or two years. Exceptionally large seabird colonies exist along the coast. Additionally, there are large populations of sea mammals in the North Pacific Ocean between the Alaska Peninsula and Kamchatka. This includes harbor seals, ringed seals, northern fur seals, whales, porpoises, sea otters and sea lions. The rugged southern half of the peninsula, and also the Kodiak Archipelago which lie off the south coast of the peninsula and are home to even more bears, constitute the Alaska Peninsula montane taiga ecoregion and contain a number of protected areas such as Katmai National Park. Vegetation on the Peninsula consists mostly of shrub-lands, grassy meadows, or wet tundra. Demographics Besides the communities on the coast (see: Bristol Bay), the Alaska Peninsula also is home to several well- known villages: Cold Bay, King Cove, Perryville, Chignik, Chignik Lake, Chignik Lagoon, and Port Moller. Each is primarily inhabited by Alaska Natives and each, likewise, is mostly dependent on the fishing industry for sustenance. The village of Sand Point should be included here, despite its location on Popof Island, an island of the Shumagin Islands, just off the southern coast of the Peninsula.

In addition to having held top positions in Italian governments, he was also the president of the European Parliament. In 2003 he was appointed to be an Italian senator for life, a seat which he held until his death. In the first five years as senator, he was an independent. From 2008 until his death in June 2013, Colombo was a member of the Autonomies group, formed mainly by elects in Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol.

Career Emilio Colombo with Ronald Reagan (1981) Colombo entered politics as a member of the Christian Democracy in 1948. He was firstly elected to the parliament in 1948. Having held several cabinet posts, he served as the prime minister of Italy from 1970 until his resignation in 1972. A number of progressive reforms were introduced during Colombo's time as prime minister. A housing reform law of 22 October 1971 introduced new criteria for land expropriations and provisions for urban renewals. Under a law of 6 December 1971, state funds were made available for the construction of a kindergarten in every local authority. A law of 30 December 1971 introduced new regulations covering protection of female workers and maternity insurance. The duration of maternity leave was extended two months prior to, and two months after confinement for all employees, and all female workers were entitled to an earnings-related indemnity, equal to 80% of earnings (including agricultural workers and tenant farmers). Also introduced was an entitlement to voluntary extra period of leave for six months during the first year of the child‚Äôs life, with job security and an indemnity equal to 30% of earnings, together with an entitlement to paid absences due to the child‚Äôs sickness during the first three years if the child‚Äôs life. In addition, a special natality allowance was introduced for self-employed women in the agricultural, artisan, and commercial sectors.Growth to Limits: The Western European Welfare States Since World War II Volume 4 edited by Peter Flora Later he became president of the European Parliament (occupying that office from 1977 until 1979) and foreign minister of Italy (from 1980 until 1983, and again from 1992 until 1993).

British Rail fired him in 1967 for publishing an outspoken and critical book, I Tried to Run a Railway. Early life and family He was educated at Winchester College and Hertford College, Oxford and then joined the London and North Eastern Railway as a Traffic Apprentice in 1928. He was related to the actors Ralph and Joseph Fiennes, and the explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes. Railway career After his apprenticeship his subsequent appointments included: * Assistant Yardmaster, Whitemoor Yard, Cambridgeshire, 1932 * Chief Controller, Cambridge, 1934. * Various appointments at York, London Liverpool Street station, Edinburgh, and Shenfield. *De facto District Operating Superintendent, Cambridge, during the early wartime. * District Operating Superintendent, Nottingham, 1943. * District Operating Superintendent, Stratford station, east London, 1944. * Operating Superintendent, Eastern Region, British Rail, 1956‚Äì57. * Line Traffic Manager, London King's Cross station, 1957‚Äì61. * Chief Operating Officer, British Railways Board, 1961‚Äì63. * Chairman of the Western Region Board and General Manager, Western Region BR, 1963‚Äì65. * Chairman of the Eastern Region Board and General Manager, Eastern Region, BR, 1965‚Äì67. Starting in 1930 as a Traffic Apprentice, Fiennes gained a broad yet deep understanding of railway operations and economics. Fiennes' principles were that \\"the railway is judged by the comfort, speed, convenience, safety, punctuality and economy of its services\\". As such, he was not averse to discontinuing services which could not be made remunerative and believed that unprofitable lines should be kept open only if there was a political will to subsidies the losses. On the other hand, Fiennes believed strongly in growing traffic and using resources intensively through aggressive scheduling and that, in order to compete with air and road, the average end- to-end speed of passenger trains had to be at least 75 m.p.h. (120 km/h). Such speeds required much higher power locomotives than British Railways was ordering in large numbers at the time. As Line Traffic Manager of the East Coast Main Line in the late 1950s he was largely responsible for pushing for the purchase by BR of the 22 English Electric/ Napier \\"Deltic\\" locomotives in 1959 (in service 1961‚Äì82). These were deemed necessary as they were capable of prolonged running at 100 mph (160 km/h), in order to provide the non- electrified East Coast route with a level of service comparable with that of the electrified West Coast Main Line. As Chief Operating Officer at the British Railways Board at a time when a fleet of 100,000 freight wagons managed an average of just 20 journeys per year, he devised the \\"Merry-go- Round\\" (MGR) concept for continuous operation of coal and ore trains with loading and unloading on the move but was unable to overcome procrastination by his superiors and by the National Coal Board (which would have to invest in modern loading facilities) for several years. When finally introduced, MGR brought about drastic increases in efficiency and reductions in cost of bulk transport by rail. In one case, a proposed investment in 550 conventional wagons of 24,5 tons capacity was replaced with 44 MGR wagons of 32,5 tons capacity. On the Eastern Region in the mid-1960s he demonstrated that large savings could be made on unprofitable lines by use of the idea of a basic railway with less costly infrastructure, utilizing track singling, unstaffed stations with larger car parks and fares collected on the trains. He was fired from British Rail in 1967 for publishing the autobiographical book I Tried to Run a Railway, which was outspoken about the management of British Rail and government policy changes and particularly critical of the frequent management re-organisations that the railways had gone through since nationalisation. Later life Following his main railway career, Fiennes was a director of Hargreaves Group between 1968 and 1976. He was a director of the railway publishers Ian Allan Ltd, who had published his book, and for whose rail industry magazines he had previously written extensively. He was Mayor of Aldeburgh, Suffolk in 1976. Fiennes continued his association with railways by accepting an invitation to join the Board of Directors of the independent, narrow gauge, Ffestiniog Railway Company, in North Wales, on which he served between 1968 and 1974. Between 1970 and 1974 he was the Company's nominee to the Board of directors of the Ffestiniog Railway Society, the voluntary supporters' organisation.

These paints make it possible to avoid using volatile organic compounds such as turpentine that may be harmful if inhaled. Water-miscible oil paint can be mixed and applied using the same techniques as traditional oil-based paint, but while still wet it can be removed from brushes, palettes, and rags with ordinary soap and water. Its water solubility comes from the use of an oil medium in which one end of the molecule has been altered to bind loosely to water molecules, as in a solution. Handling in comparison with other media The traditional rule of gradation of layers ‚Äî \\"fat over lean,\\" or flexible over less flexible ‚Äî applies to water miscible oil paint as it does to traditional oil, and in this respect the two kinds of paint behave in the same way. However, their handling is slightly different: when thinned with water to a considerably liquid phase, water miscible oil paint tends to feel and behave like watercolor (although, unlike watercolor, and to a greater extent than traditional oil, it may lose adhesion to the ground or support if over-thinned); by contrast, when used as a short paste without water for heavy impasto work, it tends to drag, developing a consistency somewhat \\"gummier\\" or tackier than the more buttery one characteristic of oils. At midrange (between short paste and long paste) water miscible oil paint is gouache-like, sharing the properties of both transparent watercolor and opaque oil (in the manner of watercolor, for example, some colors will darken upon drying, the more so as more water is mixed into the paint, and in the manner of oil, the paint film will have some thickness to it). Also gouache-like is the overall effect, which tends to be matte as compared to the glossier oil, but this too is a property that will vary, depending on the pigment used and on any mediums (or diluents) mixed into it, as well as on the pastiness of the paint (as a general rule, the pastier, the glossier). The handling of water miscible oil paint, in summary, changes considerably as it passes from one phase to another: this makes it a versatile medium but, by the same token, it also requires the artist to develop by experience specific skills with which to successfully manipulate it and exploit its range to achieve the desired effect. Although the practice of mixing water-mixable oils with acrylics is possible (as some brands claim), it is not recommended if the painting's longevity is a concern. The reason is that once the acrylic dries, its impermeability isolates the oil from oxygen, preventing it from oxidizing properly. Since each manufacture of these paints has its own formula for creating the water-mixable capacity, the following should be checked with each manufacturer‚Äôs paint. As the artist writing this paragraph uses Lukas Berlin water-mixable oils, the following applies to Lukas Berlin. They are quite stable on acrylic gesso primed surfaces. Therefore, after all polymerization has occurred, when subjected to a damaging force can with stand quite some force without suffering damage to the paint film. The same is not true when they are applied to oil primed, or oil ground surfaces, i.e., canvas, canvas board, or paper. When fully dried the paint is not fully attached to the oil primed surface. It is easily damaged by any force acted upon it. Brands There are several manufacturers producing water miscible oil paint, including: Daler-Rowney (Georgian Water Mixable Oil); Daniel Smith (Water Soluble Oil Colors); Grumbacher (Max Water Mixable Oil); Holbein Works (DUO); Lukas (BERLIN); Martin F. Weber Co. (wOil); Reeves (tube sets and complete painting set); Royal Talens (Cobra Artist and Cobra Study); and Winsor & Newton (Artisan Water Mixable Oil Color). Mediums Although this type of paint may be thinned with water, artists may prefer to use specially prepared mediums for improved texture and control. These mediums improve flow (i.e., make the thinned paint less runny and more easily controlled) and can slow or speed up drying time. Mediums are offered by many of the paint manufacturers. Royal Talens also has produced a water mixable painting paste that acts as a thickener as well as transparetizer which will not change the consistency of the paint. There are many documented issues with accelerator products in this category causing cracking and damaging the archivability of the medium. Winsor and Newton has created a special line of oils, mediums, varnishes, and thinners to complement their ‚ÄúArtisan‚Äù brand of water mixable oil colors. This line includes thinner, linseed oil, safflower oil, stand oil, painting medium, fast drying medium, and impasto medium, as well as gloss varnish, matt varnish, satin varnish, and varnish remover. Daniel Smith also offers a range of suitable mediums.

The album won the Billboard Jazz Critics Best Piano LP poll for 1961. History Explorations was the second album Evans recorded with his trio of Scott LaFaro on bass and Paul Motian on drums. Evans considered it one of his favorites from this period. Producer Orrin Keepnews in the liner notes talks about the two extra pieces that were released on the CD, \\"Beautiful Love (take 1)\\" and \\"The Boy Next Door\\"; the first version of \\"Beautiful Love\\" to be included in the original LP was a second take. In fact, as Keepnews specifies, \\"it is not the usual case of a second attempt that immediately followed the first. Early in this date, he played this number once; we both approved, and he moved on to something else. Much later, he decided to try a second 'Beautiful Love', which he later preferred.\\" \\"The Boy Next Door,\\" on the other hand, was set aside at the time of the LP, because of the limited space available on the album. The album was remastered and reissued by Original Jazz Classics in 2011 with two previously unissued alternate takes. Reception The album won the Billboard Jazz Critics Best Piano LP poll for 1961. David Rickert of All About Jazz wrote: \\"...Evans demands to be heard, seducing you with his indelibly emotional playing... The trio works magic here, breathing fresh air into standards such as 'How Deep Is the Ocean?' and 'Beautiful Love' and creating the illusion that these songs were written just so someone like Evans could play them. The highlight of the album is 'Elsa,' which is one of the most beautiful piano ballads on record.\\" Writing for Allmusic, critic Thom Jurek said of the album: \\"Evans, with Paul Motian and Scott LaFaro, was onto something as a trio, exploring the undersides of melodic and rhythmic constructions that had never been considered by most...

It replaced the company's He 60, but did not remain in service long before being replaced in turn by the Arado Ar 196 as Germany's standard observation seaplane. Design and development While the fuselage and flotation gear of the He 114 were completely conventional, its wing arrangement was highly unusual. The upper set of wings was attached to the fuselage with a set of cabane struts, as in a parasol wing monoplane, whereas the lower set was of much lesser span while having approximately the same chord. (Note that this general layout isn't especially unusual, and is known as a \\"Sesquiplane\\", or a biplane which has a smaller lower wing. Typically, the lower wing is about 3/4 of the span of the upper wing, and has a smaller chord as well. The He 114 has a much shorter lower wing than usual, but has the same chord as the upper wing, which keeps the wing area ratio similar.) Operational history The He 114 was never a great success, was not built in large numbers, and served with the Luftwaffe for only a short time. While the He 60 had handled very well on the water but been sluggish in the air, the He 114's handling while afloat was poor and its performance in the air scarcely better than the aircraft it replaced. 24 aircraft were exported to Romania, where the last 8 remained in service until 1 May 1960. In July 1943 Spain acquired a total amount of 12 aircraft of the A and C variants, they were retired in 1954. On 1 November 1939 Sweden ordered 12 aircraft of the B-1 variant, the aircraft were planned to be delivered in December the same year but was soon rescheduled to Spring the following year. In April 1940 Sweden increased the order by 24 aircraft, Heinkel responded by informing that the original order would not be delivered as the German government had enacted a ban on military materiel export to Sweden. When the ban was lifted the 12 aircraft originally intended for Sweden had already been taken into service of the Luftwaffe. By the end of 1940 Germany gave notice that it could deliver 12 aircraft, Sweden accepted but Germany soon cancelled the order. The purchase could however be realized in 1941 and 12 used He 114 arrived to Sweden dismantled in boxes in Spring the same year. The airplanes were assembled and given a complete overhaul before entering service at Roslagens flygflottilj (F2) in H√§gern√§s under the designation S 12 (S being an abbreviation for 'reconnaissance aircraft' in Sweden).

' stands for \\"file identification\\". stands for Description In Zipfile. Traditionally, a FILE_ID.DIZ should be \\"up to 10 lines of text, each line being no more than 45 characters long.\\" according to the specification v1.9. The concept of DIZ files was to allow a concise description of uploaded files to be automatically applied. Advertisements and \\"high ASCII\\" artwork were specifically prohibited. History Bulletin boards commonly accept uploaded files from their users. The BBS software would prompt the user to supply a description for the uploaded file, but these descriptions were often less than useful. BBS system operators spent many hours going over the upload descriptions correcting and editing the descriptions. The inclusion in archives was designed to address this problem. Clark Development and the Association of Shareware Professionals supported the idea of this becoming a standard for file descriptions. Clark rewrote the PCBDescribe program and included it with their PCBoard BBS software. The ASP urged their members to use this description file format in their distributions. Michael Leavitt, an employee of Clark Development, released the file specification and his PCBDescribe program source code to the public domain and urged other BBS software companies to support the DIZ file. SysOps could add a common third- party script written in PPL, called \\"DIZ/2-PCB\\" that would process, rewrite, verify, and format DIZ files from archives as they were uploaded to a BBS. The software would extract the archive, examine the contents, compile a report, import the DIZ description file and then format it according to your liking. During this time, it was usual practice to add additional lines to the description, such as ads exclaiming the source of the uploaded BBS. Even since the decline of the dial-up bulletin board system, FILE_ID.DIZ files are still utilized by the warez scene in their releases of unlicensed software. They are commonly bundled as part of the complete packaging by self-described pirate groups, and indicate the number of disks, and other basic information. Along with the NFO file, it is essential to the release. Especially in terms of unlicensed software (\\"warez\\"), it was common for each file in a sequential compressed archive (an archive intentionally split into multiple parts at creation so the parts can then be individually downloaded by slower connections like dial-up. Example: .rar, .r00, .r01, .r02, etc.), to contain this file. This probably contributed to its extended popularity after the decline of the bulletin board system in the late 1990s and early 2000s until now, since even casual consumers of unlicensed software would have stumbled upon it due to its abundance. Formal structure While real-world use among BBSs varied, with the NPD world and even different BBS brands coming up with expanded versions, the official format is: Plain, 7 bit ASCII text, each line no more than 45 characters wide. # Program/file name: Ideally, all uppercase, and followed by one space. Carriage returns are ignored in this file # Version number: in the format v1.123, followed by a space # ASP number: only if an actual ASP member, otherwise ignored # Description separator: a single short hyphen \\"-\\" # Description: The description of the file.

Complaints about inadequate municipal services, including fire and police services, lighting, sanitation, and drainage, occurred during this time period. The 1875 secession complaint asked for the paving of streets and upgrades to the utility system. The city government ameliorated the 1883 complaints by establishing a drawbridge at San Jacinto Street that crossed the Buffalo Bayou. It paved parts of Odin Avenue, now known as Lyons Avenue, in brick in the 1890s. The pavement ended two blocks after the residence of Mayor of Houston John T.

This fire became known as the \\"Great Fifth Ward Fire\\". The strong winds spread the fire as embers set wood-shingled roofs on fire. It consumed a church, school, 13 industrial plants, eight stores, and 119 homes, mostly located in the Fifth Ward. There were no deaths, but there was over $3 million in property damage.The largest fire in Houston's history began at half past midnight on February 21, 1912. It was the Great Fifth Ward Fire. The night was cold because of a stiff norther blowing in. The fire started in an abandoned house at the corner of Hardy and Opelousas. Gale-force winds carried embers southward igniting dozens of wood-shingle roofs. By dawn, the fire had spread all the way to Buffalo Bayou. It had jumped the bayou where the fire was finally stopped. Destroyed in the wake of the Fifth Ward conflagration was a church, a school, 13 industrial plants, eight stores, and 119 dwellings. Value of the property loss exceeded $3-million.

She was created by Yoshinori Kitase and was his favorite character in the game. She struggles with allegiances between the Empire and the rebel group the Returners before ultimately siding with the latter. She becomes the lead protagonist in the second half of the game after the world is destroyed, a role she got due to Kitase's enjoyment of her character. She appears in other Final Fantasy titles, including the Theatrhythm Final Fantasy series and World of Final Fantasy. She has received generally positive reception, praised by critics for being a good female character. Her attempted suicide, struggles with allegiance, and opera scene are cited as among the most significant aspects of Final Fantasy VI. Concept and creation Celes' character and story were designed by Yoshinori Kitase, including her attempted suicide and opera performance. who regarded her as his favorite character in Final Fantasy VI. Her role in the game was limited at first, but this changed later in development. She was the first character players control in the World of Ruin due to not wanting fellow protagonist Terra Branford's story to be given too much emphasis over others'. Kitase's enjoyment for Celes informed the decision to feature her specifically as the lead character. She was a Rune Knight, able to use an ability called Rune. This ability was originally owned by another character named Locke Cole. She was originally meant to feature the \\"conflicted spy\\" archetype where she would spy on the protagonists. She was also supposed to be mentally unstable like Final Fantasy VI antagonist Kefka. She was originally depicted being tortured while restrained, but this was changed in the Game Boy Advance port of Final Fantasy VI due to the lack of Computer Entertainment Rating Organization age ratings when Final Fantasy VI was originally released. Appearances Celes first appears in Final Fantasy VI as one of the game's protagonists. A former general of the Empire, Celes joined the Returners after being jailed for questioning imperial practices. She becomes particularly close to Returners member Locke Cole. Celes struggles with her allegiance, at turns betraying the Returners and later trying to kill Kefka. She performs at an opera house in order to fill in for a woman who was not able to fill her role. In the second half of the game, Celes awakens from a coma on a deserted island, having been cared for by Cid, another person from the Empire. She discovers that the world had been sent into ruin by Kefka and that he has obtained godlike power to rule the world and that his rule is causing all life to slowly wither away. She attempts to care for Cid, though if players do not do an adequate job feeding him, he passes away. This causes Celes to fall into despair and attempt to kill herself by jumping off a cliff. Whether he lives or dies, she discovers Locke's bandanna, leading her to take a raft Cid had made to find if any of her compatriots had survived. Finding her friends causes her to have hope, and they use an airship to confront Kefka and end his reign. She later appears as a playable character in the Theatrhythm Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy Tactics S, and Final Fantasy: Record Keeper. She appears as a supporting character in World of Final Fantasy, where she received her first voice role by Houko Kuwashima and Christina Rose in Japanese and English respectively. Reception Celes Chere has received generally positive reception following her appearance in Final Fantasy VI. She was named the 11th best Final Fantasy character by Marc Nix for IGN in 2008, owing to her opera house scene and the memorability of her aria. IGN staff also featured her as one of the best Final Fantasy characters in 2011, where she was praised for her strong sub-plot, her attempts to save Cid, and her opera scene. Richard Eisenbeis for Kotaku discussed how the aria combined with Celes' attempted suicide drove him to tears. Peter Tieryas for Kotaku discussed how Celes' despair and hope during the second portion mirrors the players and how her suicide attempt affects him years after. Alana Hagues for RPGFan discussed how she saw herself in Celes due to going through similar trials and tribulations, particularly Celes losing her allies, the loss of a family member, and her attempted suicide. The relationship between her and Locke was praised as one of the most beautiful subtle romances in video games by Stew Shearer for The Escapist. She has been requested for inclusion in the Dissidia Final Fantasy fighting game series as a playable character by staff of websites including Hardcore Gamer, Electronic Gaming Monthly, and Digitally Downloaded, the latter calling her their favorite character in Final Fantasy VI. Her Amano-designed outfit was featured among the best Final Fantasy outfits by Maddy Myers for Paste Magazine, while Todd Harper for Paste Magazine preferred the Amano design over her in-game artwork. Chad Concelmo for Destructoid also praised her outfit, noting that the bright yellows in it work well with her fair skin. She is particularly popular as a female character in video games, voted the fifth best female Final Fantasy character by fans. She was also discussed in Nintendojo's roundtable of their favorite female characters, with writer Joshua Johnston praising her, noting that her quest to reunite the protagonists in the second half of the game is her standout moment. However, writer James Labolokie disagreed, feeling that Celes relies too much on Cid and Locke to qualify as a character who breaks boundaries. Jef Rouner for the Houston Press was similarly critical of how she was depicted, noting that despite her and Terra's importance and strength, they are frequently \\"bound and dominated\\" by men and require their aide. Video game developer Robert Boyd included her in his list of the best warrior heroines in Japanese role-playing games. Kimberley Wallace for Game Informer included her in their celebration of female role-playing game characters. They called her one of the game's most memorable characters, praising her admirable strength and her opera scene. GamesRadar+ staff called her one of the most inspirational female video game characters, discussing how her struggle to leave the Empire as well as her betrayal of the Empire made her a more relatable and admirable character.

The first vision proclaimed that \\"within a few moons there was to be a great upheaval or earthquake...

Its fossils have been found in geological formations dating to the very end of the Cretaceous Period, about 68‚Äì66 million years ago, in western North America, making it among the last of the non-avian dinosaurs. It was named by Barnum Brown in 1908; the only species in the genus is A. magniventris. The genus name means \\"fused lizard\\", and the specific name means \\"great belly\\". A handful of specimens have been excavated to date, but a complete skeleton has not been discovered. Though other members of Ankylosauria are represented by more extensive fossil material, Ankylosaurus is often considered the archetypal member of its group, despite having some unusual features. Possibly the largest-known ankylosaurid, Ankylosaurus is estimated to have been between long and to have weighed between . It was quadrupedal, with a broad, robust body. It had a wide, low skull, with two horns pointing backward from the back of the head, and two horns below these that pointed backward and down. Unlike other ankylosaurs, its nostrils faced sideways rather than towards the front. The front part of the jaws was covered in a beak, with rows of small, leaf-shaped teeth farther behind it. It was covered in armor plates, or osteoderms, with bony half-rings covering the neck, and had a large club on the end of its tail. Bones in the skull and other parts of the body were fused, increasing their strength, and this feature is the source of the genus name. Ankylosaurus is a member of the family Ankylosauridae, and its closest relatives appear to be Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus. Ankylosaurus is thought to have been a slow-moving animal, able to make quick movements when necessary. Its broad muzzle indicates it was a non-selective browser. Sinuses and nasal chambers in the snout may have been for heat and water balance or may have played a role in vocalization. The tail club is thought to have been used in defense against predators or in intraspecific combat. Ankylosaurus has been found in the Hell Creek, Lance, Scollard, Frenchman, and Ferris formations, but appears to have been rare in its environment. Although it lived alongside a nodosaurid ankylosaur, their ranges and ecological niches do not appear to have overlapped, and Ankylosaurus may have inhabited upland areas. Ankylosaurus also lived alongside dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, and Edmontosaurus. History of discovery Skull of holotype AMNH 5895 and reconstruction diagram of same In 1906, an American Museum of Natural History expedition led by American paleontologist Barnum Brown discovered the type specimen of Ankylosaurus magniventris (AMNH 5895) in the Hell Creek Formation, near Gilbert Creek, Montana. The specimen (found by collector Peter Kaisen) consisted of the upper part of a skull, two teeth, part of the shoulder girdle, cervical, dorsal, and caudal vertebrae, ribs, and more than thirty osteoderms (armor plates). Brown scientifically described the animal in 1908; the genus name is derived from the Greek words ' ('bent' or 'crooked'), referring to the medical term ankylosis, the stiffness produced by the fusion of bones in the skull and body, and ' ('lizard'). The name can be translated as \\"fused lizard\\", \\"stiff lizard\\", or \\"curved lizard\\". The type species name magniventris is derived from the ('great') and ('belly'), referring to the great width of the animal's body. 1908 skeletal reconstruction of AMNH 5895, with missing parts restored after Stegosaurus The skeletal reconstruction accompanying the 1908 description restored the missing parts in a fashion similar to Stegosaurus, and Brown likened the result to the extinct armored mammal Glyptodon. In contrast to modern depictions, Brown's stegosaur-like reconstruction showed robust forelimbs, a strongly arched back, a pelvis with prongs projecting forwards from the ilium and pubis, as well as a short, drooping tail without a tail club, which was unknown at the time. Brown also reconstructed the armor plates in parallel rows running down the back; this arrangement was purely hypothetical. Brown's reconstruction became highly influential, and restorations of the animal based on his diagram were published as late as the 1980s. In a 1908 review of Brown's Ankylosaurus description, the American paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston criticised the skeletal reconstruction as being based on too few remains, and claimed that Ankylosaurus was merely a synonym of the genus Stegopelta, which Williston had named in 1905. Williston also stated that a skeletal reconstruction of the related Polacanthus by Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa was a better example of how ankylosaurs would have appeared in life. The claim of synonymy was not accepted by other researchers, and the two genera are now considered distinct. Brown had collected 77 osteoderms while excavating a Tyrannosaurus specimen in the Lance Formation of Wyoming in 1900. He mentioned these osteoderms (specimen AMNH 5866) in his description of Ankylosaurus but thought they belonged to the Tyrannosaurus instead. Paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn also expressed this view when he described the Tyrannosaurus specimen as the now synonymous genus Dynamosaurus in 1905. More recent examination has shown them to be similar to those of Ankylosaurus; it seems that Brown had compared them with some Euoplocephalus osteoderms, which had been erroneously cataloged as belonging to Ankylosaurus at the AMNH. Excavation of AMNH 5214 (center, above the pick), 1910 In 1910 another AMNH expedition led by Brown discovered an Ankylosaurus specimen (AMNH 5214) in the Scollard Formation by the Red Deer River in Alberta, Canada. This specimen included a complete skull, mandibles, the first and only tail club known of this genus, as well as ribs, vertebrae, limb bones, and armor. In 1947 the American fossil collectors Charles M. Sternberg and T. Potter Chamney collected a skull and mandible (specimen CMN 8880, formerly NMC 8880), 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) north of where the 1910 specimen was found. This is the largest-known Ankylosaurus skull, but it is damaged in places. A section of caudal vertebrae (specimen CCM V03) was discovered in the 1960s in the Powder River drainage, Montana, part of the Hell Creek Formation. In addition to these five incomplete specimens, many other isolated osteoderms and teeth have been found. In 1990 American paleontologist Walter P. Coombs pointed out that the teeth of two skulls assigned to A. magniventris differed from those of the holotype specimen in some details, and though he expressed a \\"considerate temptation\\" to name a new species of Ankylosaurus for these, he refrained from doing so, as the range of variation in the species was not completely documented. He also raised the possibility that the two teeth associated with the holotype specimen perhaps did not belong to it, as they were found in matrix within the nasal chambers. The American paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter accepted the teeth as belonging to A. magniventris in 2004, and that all the specimens belonged to the same species, noting that the teeth of other ankylosaurs are highly variable. Replica of the 1964 World's Fair Ankylosaurus (note spikes and dragging tail), Royal Alberta Museum Most of the known Ankylosaurus specimens were not scientifically described at length, though several paleontologists planned to do so until Carpenter redescribed the genus in 2004. Carpenter noted that Ankylosaurus has become the archetypal member of its group, and the best-known ankylosaur in popular culture, perhaps due to a life-sized reconstruction of the animal being featured at the 1964 World's Fair in New York City. That sculpture, as well as the American artist Rudolph Zallinger's 1947 mural The Age of Reptiles and other later popular depictions, showed Ankylosaurus with a tail club, following the first discovery of this feature in 1910. In spite of its familiarity, it is known from far fewer remains than its closest relatives. In 2017 the Canadian paleontologists Victoria M. Arbour and Jordan Mallon redescribed the genus in light of newer ankylosaur discoveries, including elements of the holotype that had not been previously mentioned in the literature (such as parts of the skull and the cervical half-rings). They concluded that though Ankylosaurus is iconic and the best-known member of its group, it was bizarre in comparison to related ankylosaurs, and therefore not representative of the group. Many traditional popular depictions show Ankylosaurus in a squatting posture and with a huge tail club being dragged over the ground. Modern reconstructions show the animal with a more upright limb posture and with the tail held off the ground. Likewise, large spines projecting sideways from the body (similar to those of nodosaurid ankylosaurs) are present in many traditional depictions, but are not known from Ankylosaurus itself. The armor of Ankylosaurus has often been conflated with that of Edmontonia (earlier referred to as Palaeoscincus); in addition to Ankylosaurus being depicted with spikes, Edmontonia has also been depicted with an Ankylosaurus-like tail club (a feature nodosaurids did not have), including in a mural by the American artist Charles R. Knight from 1930. Description Size of the smallest (AMNH 5214) and largest (CMN 8880) known specimens, compared to a human Ankylosaurus was the largest-known ankylosaurine dinosaur and possibly the largest ankylosaurid. In 2004 Carpenter estimated that the individual with the largest-known skull (specimen CMN 8880), which is long and wide, was about long and had a hip height of about . The smallest-known skull (specimen AMNH 5214) is long and wide, and Carpenter estimated that it measured about long and about tall at the hips. In 2017, based on comparisons with more complete ankylosaurines, Arbour and Mallon estimated a length of for CMN 8880, and for AMNH 5214. Though the latter is the smallest specimen of Ankylosaurus, its skull is still larger than those of any other ankylosaurins. A few other ankylosaurs reached about in length. Because the vertebrae of AMNH 5214 are not significantly larger than those of other ankylosaurines, Arbour and Mallon considered their upper range estimate of nearly for large Ankylosaurus too long, and suggested a length of instead. Arbour and Mallon estimated a weight of for AMNH 5214, and tentatively estimated the weight of CMN 8880 at . Benson and colleagues also estimated the weight for the animal of AMNH 5214 at in 2014. restoration The structure of much of the skeleton of Ankylosaurus, including most of the pelvis, tail, and feet, is still unknown. It was quadrupedal, and its hind limbs were longer than its forelimbs. In specimen AMNH 5895, the scapula (shoulder blade) measures long and was fused with the coracoid (a rectangular bone connected to the lower end of the scapula). It also had entheses (connective tissue) for various muscle attachments. The humerus (upper arm bone) of AMNH 5214 was short, very broad and about long. The femur (thigh bone), also from AMNH 5214, was long and very robust. While the feet of Ankylosaurus are incompletely known, the hindfeet probably had three toes, as is the case in advanced ankylosaurids. The cervical vertebrae had broad neural spines that increased in height towards the body. The front part of the neural spines had well-developed entheses, which was common among adult dinosaurs, and indicates the presence of large ligaments, which helped support the massive head. The dorsal vertebrae had centra (or bodies) that were short relative to their width, and their neural spines were short and narrow. The dorsal vertebrae were tightly spaced, which limited the downwards movement of the back. The neural spines had ossified (turned to bone) tendons, which also overlapped some of the vertebrae. The ribs of the last four back vertebrae were fused to the and (the structures that articulated the ribs with the vertebrae), and the ribcage was very broad in this part of the body. The caudal vertebrae had centra that were slightly amphicoelous, meaning they were concave on both sides. =Skull= Skull (AMNH 5214) from the side and above The three known Ankylosaurus skulls differ in various details; this is thought to be the result of taphonomy (changes happening during decay and fossilization of the remains) and individual variation. The skull was low and triangular in shape, and wider than it was long; the back of the skull was broad and low. The skull had a broad beak on the premaxillae. The orbits (eye sockets) were almost round to slightly oval and did not face directly sideways because the skull tapered towards the front. The braincase was short and robust, as in other ankylosaurines. Crests above the orbits merged into the upper squamosal horns (their shape has been described as \\"pyramidal\\"), which pointed backwards to the sides from the back of the skull. The crest and horn were probably separate elements originally, as seen in the related Pinacosaurus and Euoplocephalus. Below the upper horns, jugal horns were present, which pointed backward and down. The horns may have originally been osteoderms that fused to the skull. The scale-like cranial ornamentation on the surfaces of ankylosaurs skulls is called \\"\\", and were the result of remodeling of the skull itself. This obliterated the sutures between skull elements, which is common for adult ankylosaurs. The caputegulum pattern of the skull was variable between specimens, though some details are shared. The caputegulae are named according to their position on the skull, and those of Ankylosaurus include a relatively large, hexagonal (or diamond-shaped) nasal caputegulum at the front of the snout between the nostrils, which had a loreal caputegulum on each side, an anterior and posterior supraorbital caputegulum above each orbit, and a ridge of nuchal caputegulae at the back of the skull. Tooth of AMNH 5895 in inner and outer view The snout region of Ankylosaurus was unique among ankylosaurs, and had undergone an \\"extreme\\" transformation compared to its relatives. The snout was arched and truncated at the front, and the nostrils were elliptical and were directed downward and outward, unlike in all other known ankylosaurids where they faced obliquely forward or upward. Additionally, the nostrils were not visible from the front because the sinuses were expanded to the sides of the premaxilla bones, to a larger extent than seen in other ankylosaurs. Large loreal caputegulae‚Äîstrap-like, side osteoderms of the snout‚Äîcompletely roofed the enlarged opening of the nostrils, giving a bulbous appearance. The nostrils also had an intranarial septum, which separated the nasal passage from the sinus. Each side of the snout had five sinuses, four of which expanded into the maxilla bone. The nasal cavities (or chambers) of Ankylosaurus were elongated and separated by a septum at the midline, which divided the inside of the snout into two mirrored halves. The nasal chambers had two openings, including the choanae (internal nostrils), and the air passage was looped. The maxillae expanded to the sides, giving the impression of a bulge, which may have been due to the sinuses inside. The maxillae had a ridge that may have been the attachment site for fleshy cheeks; the presence of cheeks in ornithischians is controversial, but some nodosaurs had armor plates that covered the cheek region, which may have been embedded in the flesh. Specimen AMNH 5214 has 34‚Äì35 dental alveoli (tooth sockets) in the maxilla. The tooth rows in the maxillae of this specimen are about long. Each alveolus had a foramen (opening) near its side where a replacement tooth could be seen. Compared to other ankylosaurs, the mandible of Ankylosaurus was low in proportion to its length, and, when seen from the side, the tooth row was almost straight instead of arched. The mandibles are completely preserved only in the smallest specimen (AMNH 5214) and are about long. The incomplete mandible of the largest specimen (CMN 8880) is the same length. AMNH 5214 has 35 dental alveoli in the left dentary and 36 in the right, for a total of 71. The predentary bone of the tip of the mandibles has not yet been found. Like other ankylosaurs, Ankylosaurus had small, phylliform (leaf-shaped) teeth, which were compressed sideways. The teeth were mostly taller than they were wide, and were very small; their size in proportion to the skull meant that the jaws of Ankylosaurus could accommodate more teeth than other ankylosaurines. The teeth of the largest Ankylosaurus skull are smaller than those of the smallest skull in the absolute sense. Some teeth from behind in the tooth row curved backwards, and tooth crowns were usually flatter on one side than the other. Ankylosaurus teeth are diagnostic and can be distinguished from the teeth of other ankylosaurids based on their smooth sides. The denticles were large, their number ranging from six to eight on the front part of the tooth, and five to seven behind. =Armor= Arbour and Mallon, 2017 A prominent feature of Ankylosaurus was its armor, consisting of knobs and plates of bone known as osteoderms, or scutes, embedded in the skin. These have not been found in articulation, so their exact placement on the body is unknown, though inferences can be made based on related animals, and various configurations have been proposed. The osteoderms ranged from in diameter to in length, and varied in shape. The osteoderms of Ankylosaurus were generally thin walled and hollowed on the underside. Compared to Euoplocephalus, the osteoderms of Ankylosaurus were smoother. Many smaller osteoderms and ossicles probably occupied the space between the larger ones, as in other ankylosaurids. The osteoderms covering the body were very flat, though with a low keel at one margin. In contrast, the nodosaurid Edmontonia had high keels stretching from one margin to the other on the midline of its osteoderms. Ankylosaurus had some smaller osteoderms with a keel across the midline. Cervical half ring from the neck of Euoplocephalus (A‚ÄìB) compared with half-ring fragments (C‚ÄìJ) of Ankylosaurus (AMNH 5895), and possible back osteoderms (K‚ÄìL) Like other ankylosaurids, Ankylosaurus had (armor plates on the neck), but these are known only from fragments, making their exact arrangement uncertain. Carpenter suggested that when seen from above, the plates would have been paired, creating an inverted V-shape across the neck, with the midline gap probably being filled with small ossicles (round bony scutes) to allow for movement. He believed the width of this armor belt was too wide to have fitted solely on the neck, and that it covered the base of the neck and continued onto the shoulder region. Arbour and the Canadian paleontologist Philip J. Currie disagreed with Carpenter's interpretation in 2015 and pointed out that the cervical half-ring fragments of specimen AMNH 5895 did not fit together in the way proposed by Carpenter (though this could be due to breakage). They instead suggested that the fragments represented the remains of two cervical half-rings, which formed two semi-circular plates of armor around the upper part of the neck, as in the closely related Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus. Arbour and Mallon elaborated on this idea, describing the shape of these half-rings as \\"continuous U-shaped yokes\\" over the upper part of the neck, and suggested that Ankylosaurus had six keeled osteoderms with oval bases on each half-ring. The first osteoderms behind the second cervical half-ring would have been similar in shape to those in the first half-ring, and the osteoderms on the back probably decreased in diameter hindwards. The largest osteoderms were probably arranged in transverse and longitudinal rows across most of the body, with four or five transverse rows separated by creases in the skin. The osteoderms on the flanks would probably have had a more square outline than those on the back. There may have been four longitudinal rows of osteoderms on the flanks. Unlike some basal ankylosaurs and many nodosaurs, ankylosaurids do not appear to have had co- ossified pelvic shields above their hips. Some osteoderms without keels may have been placed above the hip region of Ankylosaurus, as in Euoplocephalus. Ankylosaurus may have had three or four transverse rows of circular osteoderms over the pelvic region, which were smaller than those on the rest of the body, as in Scolosaurus. Smaller, triangular osteoderms may have been present on the sides of the pelvis. Flattened, pointed plates resemble those on the sides of the tail of Saichania, and may have been distributed similarly on Ankylosaurus. Osteoderms with oval keels could have been placed on the upper side of the tail or the side of the limbs. Compressed, triangular osteoderms found with Ankylosaurus specimens may have been placed on the sides of the pelvis or the tail. Ovoid, keeled, and teardrop-shaped osteoderms are known from Ankylosaurus, and may have been placed on the forelimbs, like those known from Pinacosaurus, but it is unknown whether the hindlimbs bore osteoderms. Only known tail club (AMNH 5214), American Museum of Natural History The tail club (or tail knob) of Ankylosaurus was composed of two large osteoderms, with a row of small osteoderms at the midline, and two small osteoderms at the tip; these osteoderms obscured the last tail vertebra. As only the tail club of specimen AMNH 5214 is known, the range of variation between individuals is unknown. The tail club of AMNH 5214 is long, wide, and tall. The club of the largest specimen may have been wide. The tail club of Ankylosaurus was semicircular when seen from above, similar to those of Euoplocephalus and Scolosaurus but unlike the pointed club osteoderms of Anodontosaurus or the narrow, elongated club of Dyoplosaurus. The last seven tail vertebrae formed the \\"handle\\" of the tail club. These vertebrae were in contact, with no cartilage between them, and were sometimes co-ossified, which made them immobile. Ossified tendons attached to the vertebrae in front of the tail club, and these features together helped strengthen it. The interlocked zygapophyses (articular processes) and neural spines of the handle vertebrae were U-shaped when seen from above, whereas those of most other ankylosaurids are V-shaped, which may be due to the handle of Ankylosaurus being wider. The larger width may indicate that the tail of Ankylosaurus was shorter in relation to its body length than those of other ankylosaurids, or that it had the same proportions but with a smaller club. Classification Brown considered Ankylosaurus so distinct that he made it the type genus of a new family, Ankylosauridae, typified by massive, triangular skulls, short necks, stiff backs, broad bodies, and osteoderms. He also classified Palaeoscincus (only known from teeth), and Euoplocephalus (then only known from a partial skull and osteoderms) as part of the family. Due to the fragmentary condition of the remains, Brown was unable to fully distinguish between Euoplocephalus and Ankylosaurus. Having for comparison only a few, incomplete members of the family, he believed the group was part of the suborder Stegosauria. In 1923 Osborn coined the name Ankylosauria, thereby placing the ankylosaurids in their own suborder. Skulls of the ankylosaurins Ankylosaurus, Euoplocephalus, and Nodocephalosaurus with color coded (cranial ornamentation) Cervical vertebra from the neck of AMNH 5895 Ankylosauria and Stegosauria are now grouped together within the clade Thyreophora. This group first appeared in the Sinemurian age, and survived for 135 million years until disappearing in the Maastrichtian. They were widespread and inhabited a broad range of environments. As more complete specimens and new genera have been discovered, theories about ankylosaurian interrelatedness have become more complex, and hypotheses have often changed between studies. In addition to Ankylosauridae, Ankylosauria has been divided into the families Nodosauridae, and sometimes Polacanthidae (these families lacked tail clubs). Ankylosaurus is considered part of the subfamily Ankylosaurinae (members of which are called ankylosaurines) within Ankylosauridae. Ankylosaurus appears to be most closely related to Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus. The following cladogram is based on a 2015 phylogenetic analysis of the Ankylosaurinae conducted by Arbour and Currie: Since Ankylosaurus and other Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids grouped with Asian genera (in a tribe the authors named Ankylosaurini), Arbour and Currie suggested that earlier North American ankylosaurids had gone extinct by the late Albian or Cenomanian ages of the Middle Cretaceous. Ankylosaurids thereafter recolonized North America from Asia during the Campanian or Turonian ages of the Late Cretaceous, and there diversified again, leading to genera such as Ankylosaurus, Anodontosaurus, and Euoplocephalus. This explains a 30-million-year gap in the fossil record of North American ankylosaurids between these ages. Paleobiology =Feeding= Skull of specimen CMN 8880, the largest-known ankylosaurid, including lower jaw (E‚ÄìF) and tooth (G) Like other ornithischians, Ankylosaurus was herbivorous. Its wide muzzle was adapted for non-selective low-browse cropping, although not to the extent seen in some related genera, especially Euoplocephalus. Though ankylosaurs may not have fed on fibrous and woody plants, they may have had a varied diet, including tough leaves and pulpy fruits. Ankylosaurus probably fed on abundant ferns and low-growing shrubs. Assuming it was endothermic, Ankylosaurus would have eaten of ferns per day, similar to the amount of dry vegetation a large elephant would consume. The requirements for nutrition could have been more effectively met if Ankylosaurus ate fruit, which its small, cusp-like teeth and the shape of its beak seem well adapted for, compared to for example Euoplocephalus. Certain invertebrates, which the small teeth may have been adapted for handling, could also have provided supplemental nutrition. Fossils of Ankylosaurus teeth exhibit wear on the face of the crown rather than on the tip of the crown, as in nodosaurid ankylosaurs. In 1982 Carpenter ascribed to baby Ankylosaurus two very small teeth that originate from the Lance and Hell Creek Formations and measure in length, respectively. The smaller tooth is heavily worn, leading Carpenter to suggest that ankylosaurids in general or at least the young did not swallow their food whole but employed some sort of chewing. Since adult Ankylosaurus did little chewing of its food, it would have spent less time in the day foraging than an elephant. Based on the broadness of the ribcage, the digestion of unchewed food may have been facilitated by hindgut fermentation like in modern herbivorous lizards, which have several chambers in their enlarged colon. Back vertebra with fused ribs of AMNH 5895. The broad body housed a large digestion system. In 1969 Austrian paleontologist Georg Haas concluded that despite the large size of ankylosaur skulls, the associated musculature was relatively weak. He also thought jaw movement was limited to up and down movements. Extrapolating from this, Haas suggested that ankylosaurs ate relatively soft non-abrasive vegetation. Later research on Euoplocephalus indicates that forward and sideways jaw movement was possible in these animals, the skull being able to withstand considerable forces. A 2016 study of the dental occlusion (contact between the teeth) of ankylosaur specimens found that the ability for backwards (palinal) jaw movement evolved independently in different ankylosaur lineages, including Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids like Ankylosaurus and Euoplocephalus. A specimen of the ankylosaur Pinacosaurus preserves large paraglossalia (triangular bones or cartilages located in the tongue) that show signs of muscular stress, and it is thought this was a common feature of ankylosaurs. The researchers who examined the specimen suggested that ankylosaurs relied heavily on muscular tongues and hyobranchia (tongue bones) when feeding since their teeth were fairly small and were replaced at a relatively slow rate. Some modern salamanders have similar tongue bones, and use prehensile tongues to pick up food. The retracted position of the nostrils of Ankylosaurus have been compared to those of fossorial (digging) worm lizards and blind snakes, and though it was probably not a burrowing animal, the snout of Ankylosaurus may indicate earth-moving behavior. These factors, as well as the low rate of tooth formation in ankylosaurs compared to other ornithischians, indicate that Ankylosaurus may have been omnivorous (eating both plant and animal matter). It may also (or alternatively) have dug in the ground for roots and tubers. =Airspaces and senses= Diagram showing nasal chambers inside the snout (AMNH 5895) In 1977 the Polish paleontologist Teresa Marya≈Ñska proposed that the complex sinuses and nasal cavities of ankylosaurs may have lightened the weight of the skull, housed a nasal gland, or acted as a chamber for vocal resonance. Carpenter rejected these hypotheses, arguing that tetrapod animals make sounds through the larynx, not the nostrils, and that reduction in weight was minimal, as the spaces only accounted for a small percent of the skull volume. He also considered a gland unlikely and noted that the sinuses may not have had any specific function. It has also been suggested that the respiratory passages were used to perform a mammal-like treatment of inhaled air, based on the presence and arrangement of specialized bones. A 2011 study of the nasal passages of Euoplocephalus by the Japanese paleontologist Tetsuto Miyashita and colleagues supported their function as a heat and water balancing system, noting the extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for the mucosa membrane (used for heat and water exchange in modern animals). The researchers also supported the idea of the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the elongated nasal passages of saiga antelope and the looping trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the nasal passages. They disputed the possibility that the looping is related to olfaction (sense of smell) as the olfactory region is pushed to the sides of the main airway. According to Carpenter, the shape of the nasal chambers of Ankylosaurus indicate that airflow was unidirectional (looping through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation), although it may also have been bidirectional in the posterior nasal chamber, with air directed past the olfactory lobes. The enlarged olfactory region of ankylosaurids indicates a well-developed sense of smell. Though hindwards retraction of the nostrils is seen in aquatic animals and animals with a proboscis, it is unlikely either possibility applies to Ankylosaurus, as the nostrils tend to be reduced or the premaxilla extended. In addition, though the widely separated nostrils may have allowed for stereo-olfaction (where each nostril senses smells from different directions), as has been proposed for the moose, little is known about this feature. The position of the orbits of Ankylosaurus suggest some stereoscopic vision. =Limb movements= Shoulder blade and coracoid of specimen AMNH 5895 Reconstructions of ankylosaur forelimb musculature made by Coombs in 1978 suggest that the forelimbs bore the majority of the animal's weight, and were adapted for high force delivery on the front feet, possibly for food gathering. In addition, Coombs suggested that ankylosaurs may have been capable diggers, though the hoof-like structure of the manus would have limited fossorial activity. Ankylosaurs were likely to have been slow-moving and sluggish animals, though they may have been capable of quick movements when necessary. =Growth= The squamosal horns of the largest Ankylosaurus specimen are blunter than those of the smallest specimen, which is also the case in Euoplocephalus, and this may represent ontogenetic variation (related to growth development). Studies of specimens of Pinacosaurus of different ages found that during ontogenetic development, the ribs of juvenile ankylosaurs fused with their vertebrae. The forelimbs strongly increased in robustness while the hindlimbs did not become larger relative to the rest of the skeleton, further evidence that the arms bore most of the weight. In the cervical half-rings, the underlying bone band developed outgrowths connecting it with the underlying osteoderms, which simultaneously fused to each other. On the skull, the middle bone plates first ossified at the snout and the rear rim, with ossification gradually extending towards the middle regions. On the rest of the body, ossification progressed from the neck backward in the direction of the tail. =Defense= Possible back osteoderm (AMNH 5895), in outer and inner view The osteoderms of ankylosaurids were thin in comparison to those of other ankylosaurs, and appear to have been strengthened by randomly distributed cushions of collagen fibers. Structurally similar to Sharpey's fibres, they were embedded directly into the bone tissue, a feature unique to ankylosaurids. This would have provided the ankylosaurids with an armor covering that was both lightweight and highly durable, being resistant to breakage and penetration by the teeth of predators. The palpebral bones over the eyes may have provided additional protection for them. Carpenter suggested in 1982 that the heavily vascularized armor may also have had a role in thermoregulation as in modern crocodilians. Restoration of Ankylosaurus displaying its tail club The tail club of Ankylosaurus seems to have been an active defensive weapon, capable of producing enough of an impact to break the bones of an assailant. The tendons of the tail were partially ossified and were not very elastic, allowing great force to be transmitted to the club when it was used as a weapon. Coombs suggested in 1979 that several hindlimb muscles would have controlled the swinging of the tail, and that violent thrusts of the club would have been able to break the metatarsal bones of large theropods. A 2009 study estimated that ankylosaurids could swing their tails at 100 degrees laterally, and the mainly cancellous clubs would have had a lowered moment of inertia and been effective weapons. The study also found that while adult ankylosaurid tail clubs were capable of breaking bones, those of juveniles were not. Despite the feasibility of tail-swinging, the researchers could not determine whether ankylosaurids used their clubs for defense against potential predators, in intraspecific combat, or both. In 1993 Tony Thulborn proposed that the tail club of ankylosaurids primarily acted as a decoy for the head, as he thought the tail too short and inflexible to have an effective reach; the \\"dummy head\\" would lure a predator close to the tail, where it could be struck. Carpenter has rejected this idea, as tail club shape is highly variable among ankylosaurids, even in the same genus. Paleoecology Map showing where Ankylosaurus fossils have been discovered; the holotype is shown in red (‚óÜ) Ankylosaurus existed between 68 and 66 million years ago, in the final, or Maastrichtian, stage of the Late Cretaceous Period. It was among the last dinosaur genera that appeared before the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event. The type specimen is from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana, while other specimens have been found in the Lance and Ferris Formations in Wyoming, the Scollard Formation in Alberta, and the Frenchman Formation in Saskatchewan, all of which date to the end of the Cretaceous. Fossils of Ankylosaurus are rare in these sediments, and the distribution of its remains suggests that it was ecologically rare, or restricted to the uplands of the formations rather than the coastal lowlands, where it would have been more likely to fossilize. Another ankylosaur, a nodosaur referred to as Edmontonia sp., is also found in the same formations, but according to Carpenter, the range of the two genera does not seem to have overlapped. Their remains have so far not been found in the same localities, and the nodosaur appears to have inhabited the lowlands. The narrower muzzle of the nodosaur suggests it had a more selective diet than Ankylosaurus, further indicating ecological separation, whether their range overlapped or not. With its low center of gravity, Ankylosaurus would have been unable to knock down trees like modern elephants do. It was also incapable of chewing bark and thus unlikely to have practiced bark stripping. As an adult, Ankylosaurus does not appear to have congregated in groups (though some ankylosaurs appear to have congregated when young). So, although it was a large herbivore with similar energetic requirements, it is therefore improbable that Ankylosaurus was able to modify the landscape of its ecosystem in the way elephants do; hadrosaurids may instead have had such an \\"ecosystem engineer\\" role. Ankylosaurus (rear left) and other animals of the Hell Creek Formation The formations where Ankylosaurus fossils have been found represent different sections of the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway dividing western and eastern North America during the Cretaceous, a broad coastal plain extending westward from the seaway to the newly formed Rocky Mountains. These formations are composed largely of sandstone and mudstone, which have been attributed to floodplain environments. The regions where Ankylosaurus and other Late Cretaceous ankylosaurs have been found had a warm subtropical/temperate climate, which was monsoonal, had occasional rainfall, tropical storms, and forest fires. In the Hell Creek Formation, many types of plants were supported, primarily angiosperms, with less common conifers, ferns and cycads. An abundance of fossil leaves found at dozens of different sites indicates that the area was largely forested by small trees. Ankylosaurus shared its environment with other dinosaurs that included the ceratopsids Triceratops and Torosaurus, the hypsilophodont Thescelosaurus, the hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus, an indeterminate nodosaur, the pachycephalosaurian Pachycephalosaurus, and the theropods Struthiomimus, Ornithomimus, Pectinodon, and Tyrannosaurus.

He was the co-founder, later CEO, and chairman emeritus of Southwest Airlines until his death in 2019. Early life Kelleher was born in Camden, New Jersey, on March 12, 1931, and raised in Audubon, New Jersey, where he graduated from Haddon Heights High School.Blackwell, Charles W. \\"Flying High with Herb Kelleher: A Profile in Charismatic Leadership\\" , Journal of Leadership Studies, June 22, 1999; accessed November 2, 2007. \\"Graduating from Haddon Heights High School where he distinguished himself as an athlete and student body president, Kelleher's first job was at Campbell Soup Company where he worked for six summers, joining his dad who was General Manager.\\" He earned a bachelor's degree from Wesleyan University where he was an Olin Scholar and where his major was English and his minor Philosophy, and a Juris Doctor (cum laude) from New York University School of Law where he was a Root-Tilden Scholar.The Economist Magazine, Obituary, Page 82 of Print Edition, 12th January 2019. Career After clerking for a New Jersey Supreme Court justice, Kelleher moved to Texas intending to start a law firm or a business. Kelleher and one of his law clients, Texas businessman Rollin King, created the concept with banker John Parker that later became Southwest Airlines. An often retold founding myth claimed the business plan was written out on a cocktail napkin in a San Antonio restaurant, though Kelleher and King have both stated that there was no literal cocktail napkin. They originally devised a very simple plan of connecting the Texas Triangle with low-cost air service, patterned largely on California's Pacific Southwest Airlines. After incorporating the company initially as \\"Air Southwest Co.\\" in 1967, Kelleher and King faced four years of setbacks and legal challenges from competitors that culminated in winning key cases before the Supreme Court of the United States in December 1970 and the Supreme Court of Texas in June 1971. The first flights finally took off on June 18, 1971. Reflecting back on that time Kelleher said, \\"I think my greatest moment in business was when the first Southwest airplane arrived after four years of litigation and I walked up to it and I kissed that baby on the lips and I cried.\\" Kelleher's early involvement in the company was helping the company navigate legal concerns and as an advisor to the operation and later as general counsel. Lamar Muse was hired as CEO, but after struggles between Muse and King escalated over the next several years, Muse resigned in 1978. Kelleher was installed as Chairman of the Board in March of that year and the board appointed him as temporary CEO until hiring Howard Putnam as the new CEO and President. In 1981, after Putnam left to head Braniff Airways, he was appointed the full-time CEO and President, positions he held for 20 years. Under Kelleher's leadership, Southwest succeeded by a strategy of offering low fares to its passengers, eliminating unnecessary services, using a single aircraft type (the Boeing 737) (except for use of the Boeing 727 and use of MD-80 by TranStar and 717 by AirTran), avoiding the hub-and-spoke scheduling system used by other airlines in favor of building point-to-point traffic, and focusing on secondary airports such as Chicago-Midway (instead of Chicago-O'Hare) and Orange County, California but later some hub flights were operated at airports, such as LAS, PHX, MDW, DEN, STL, and BWI and some major airports, like LGA, LAX, SFO, and DEN. The company he founded and built has consistently been named among the most admired companies in America in Fortune magazine's annual poll. Fortune has also called him perhaps the best CEO in America. Kelleher's outrageous personality created a corporate culture which made Southwest employees well known for taking themselves lightly but their jobs seriously. His culture-leadership was well-demonstrated in an arm- wrestling event in March 1992. Shortly after Southwest started using the \\"Just Plane Smart\\" motto, Stevens Aviation, who had been using \\"Plane Smart\\" for their motto, threatened a trademark lawsuit, which was resolved between Kelleher and Stevens Aviation CEO Kurt Herwald in an arm-wrestling match, now known as \\"Malice in Dallas\\". Kelleher lost the match, but was allowed to use the slogan in exchange for a $5,000 charitable donation and conceding Southwest's legal claim to the slogan. In March 2001, Kelleher stepped down as CEO and president of Southwest. He passed the CEO role onto James Parker and the president role to Colleen Barrett, although he remained chairman. In July 2007, Southwest announced that Kelleher would step down as chairman and resign from the board of directors in May 2008. The retirement of Barrett as president was announced at the same time, though the two would remain full- time employees for another five years. Kelleher ultimately stepped down as chairman on May 21, 2008. Immediately following, Southwest Airlines filled both the chairman and president positions with then-current CEO Gary C. Kelly, who had taken over the CEO position from Parker three years earlier. Kelleher was given the title of chairman emeritus with an office at Southwest Airlines headquarters and he remained connected to the company until his death in 2019. In July 2010, Kelleher was appointed chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas board of directors for 2011. Kelleher's term expired in 2013. Previously, he had served as deputy chair.

He left the world at the height of his secular career, and in 750 built a monastery at Fanano, a place given to him by Aistulf, King of the Lombards, who had married Anselm's sister Gisaltruda. Two years later he built the monastery of Nonantula, a short distance northeast of Modena, which Aistulf endowed. Anselm went to Rome, where Pope Stephen III invested him with the habit of Saint Benedict, gave him some relics of Saint Sylvester and appointed him Abbot of Nonantula. Anselm founded many hospices where the poor and the sick were sheltered and cared for by monks. According to the twelfth-century Catalogus abbatum nonantulorum, a list of abbots of Nonantola with their histories, Desiderius, who succeeded Aistulf as King of the Lombards in 756, banished Anselm from Nonantula in favor of his own prot√©g√©.

Overview Super Play covered in great detail the role-playing video game genre. Many of these games were never released officially in the UK or European games market, and therefore the magazine concentrated much effort in covering aspects of the American, and moreover the Japanese games markets. It also featured in-depth, intelligent and passionate coverage of all aspects of gaming. Given the close ties between the world of Japanese console RPGs and animation, the magazine also heavily featured information about manga and anime by noted UK based writer, Helen McCarthy. It can be said that Super Play was one of the magazines that helped to push forward what was at the time a nascent market for anime in the UK. In this vein, the magazine itself was also notable as its cover illustrations (and many illustrations between the covers) were done in manga-influenced style by artist Wil Overton. Overton also caricatured many of the staff in chibi form, wearing various types of anime-related costumes - sci-fi armour, flying gear, RPG-style armour etc. The cover even had the name \\"Super Play\\" written in katakana. Logo The logo for the magazine was designed by Jez Bridgeman in his first week on the magazine before the Art Editor arrived in the September before launch and at the last minute the 'PLAY' part of the logo was switched for a sans serif font and then stretched to fit the space. Publication schedule and staff The magazine was published monthly, and would regularly feature a monthly Fantasy Quest column about Japanese console RPGs in their native market. In the second half of the publication's life, there was a monthly Final Fantasy Forum dedicated to playing tips and secrets for Square games, even despite the fact that none of the Final Fantasy game series had been released in Europe at that point. Some of the most recognisable names on the Super Play writing staff were Matt Bielby, Tony Mott (former editor of Future Publishing stablemate Edge), Jason Brookes, Jonathan Davies and Zy Nicholson. The magazine was based in Bath, England and published by Future Publishing. Despite its fairly short run (47 issues, just short of 4 years, and a one-off \\"Gold\\" special in 1993), and many years since its demise, it still enjoys a fan following on the internet. Closure Its end came with the declining popularity of the SNES itself, both among games publishers and the game-buying public, as the Nintendo 64 was on the cusp of release, making way for the next generation of video game consoles. Super Play was succeeded in March 1997 by N64 Magazine, which was initially edited by Jonathan Davies with Wil Overton as Art Editor, and frequent contributions by former Super Play writers, although the magazine was much less focused on import gaming and RPGs than its forebear. N64 Magazine in turn was renamed NGC Magazine to coincide with the launch of the Nintendo GameCube, and after closure of NGC in 2006 the publication was relaunched as NGamer. Revival In September 2017, inspired by the announcement of a Super NES Classic Edition, original staff, including Jason Brookes, Jonathan Davies, Tony Mott and Zy Nicholson, along with seasoned Nintendo experts Nathan Brown, Keza MacDonald, Damien McFerran, Jeremy Parish and Chris Schilling, produced a one-off issue 48 of Super Play, which came bundled with Retro Gamer issue 172. Featuring all-new content it consists of the regular sections Super Express, Helen McCarthy's Anime World and a What Cart? guide. Also inside are new reviews of the games included on the SNES Classic, a Star Fox 2 preview and an interview with Dylan Cuthbert, one of the key developers behind the game. Cover art was created by Wil Overton, illustrator of all 48 Super Play covers, with the internal visual style resurrected by Future's senior art editor Warren Brown, who ensured the design will be immediately familiar to fans of the '90s magazine.

It was discovered on 30 September 1861 by Heinrich d'Arrest.  Observation history  NGC 1 was first observed by Heinrich d'Arrest in 1860 while testing the 11 inch refractor telescope of the Copenhagen Observatory. He described his discovery as \\"faint, small, round, between 11th and 14th magnitude stars\\" (to the north and south). Herman Schultz also observed NGC 1 three times in 1866 and 1868 using a 9.6 inch refractor telescope at Upsala. Both of the initial observers missed NGC 2, which is much fainter. NGC 1 appears to be quite close to NGC 2, in reality however, the two objects are far apart and unrelated. NGC 2 was first observed as a \\"companion\\" of NGC 1 by Lawrence Parsons.  General  optical double At an estimated 140,000 light-years in diameter, NGC 1 is roughly the same size as our own galaxy, the Milky Way, which is believed to be approximately 160,000 light-years across. Although its apparent magnitude of 13.65 lets the galaxy appear too faint to see it in the sky with the naked eye, its absolute magnitude of -22.08 makes NGC 1 two to three times more luminous than our home galaxy. The galaxy is 4.0 Mly away from the 80,000 light-year wide galaxy UGC 69, its nearest major neighbor. NGC 1 has a visual size of 1.6' √ó 1.2'. Being classified as a SABbc class galaxy using the Hubble sequence and the De Vaucouleurs system as an extension, NGC 1 is a spiral galaxy with the presence of a weak nuclear bar and loosely wound arms. Although the central galaxy is only about 90,000 light-years across, a large, diffuse arm extends eastwards from it, possibly from a past merger. Based on its redshift of approximately 0.015177 and thus recessional velocity of 4450 km/s, the distance of the galaxy from the Solar System can be calculated using Hubble's Law. Using current observation data, this places the galaxy at approximately 210 to 215 million light-years from Earth, which is in good agreement with redshift- independent distance estimates of 175 to 245 million light years. An opposing measurement of the galaxy's recessional velocity of 2215 km/s would place the galaxy only about 100 million light-years away. However, this is regarded unlikely by most astronomers and believed to be a misattributed value for a different galaxy.  Listing in astronomical catalogues  After being logged as the first object in the General Catalogue, the galaxy is also the first object to be listed in the catalogue's successor, the New General Catalogue. With an original right ascension of at the time of the catalog's compilation (epoch 1860), this object had the lowest right ascension of all the objects in the catalog, making it the first listing in the New General Catalogue as the objects were arranged by right ascension.Dreyer, J. L. E., \\"New General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of stars (1888)\\", Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society, 49. p3, Royal Astronomical Society, 1962. Since then, the coordinates have shifted, and this object no longer has the lowest right ascension of all the NGC objects.Erdmann, R.E., Jr., The Historically Corrected New General Catalogue of Nebul√¶ and Clusters of Stars, p12, retrieved and archived 13 June 2008. NGC 1 is also listed in the Uppsala General Catalogue (UGC 57) and in the Principal Galaxies Catalogue (PGC 564).

It is about away from Earth, and 120 light years across. 47 Tuc can be seen with the naked eye, with an apparent magnitude of 4.1. It appears about 50 arcminutes across. Due to its far southern location, 18¬∞ from the south celestial pole, it was not catalogued by European astronomers until the 1750s, when the cluster was first identified by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille from South Africa. 47 Tucanae is the second brightest globular cluster after Omega Centauri, and telescopically reveals about ten thousand stars, many appearing within a small dense central core. The cluster may contain an intermediate-mass black hole. Early history The cluster was recorded in 1751-2 by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille, who initially thought it was the nucleus of a bright comet. Lacaille then listed it as \\"Lac I-1\\", the first object listed in his deep-sky catalogue. The number \\"47\\" was assigned in Allgemeine Beschreibung und Nachweisung der Gestirne nebst Verzeichniss (\\"General description and verification of the stars and indexes\\"), compiled by Johann Elert Bode and published in Berlin in 1801. Bode did not observe this cluster himself, but had reordered Lacaille's catalogued stars by constellation in order of Right Ascension. In the 19th century, Benjamin Apthorp Gould assigned the Greek letter Œæ (Xi) to the cluster to designate it Œæ Tucanae, but this was not widely adopted and it is almost universally referred to as 47 Tucanae. Characteristics 47 Tucanae is the second brightest globular cluster in the sky (after Omega Centauri), and is noted for having a small very bright and dense core. It is one of the most massive globular clusters in the Galaxy, containing millions of stars. The cluster appears roughly the size of the full moon in the sky under ideal conditions. Though it appears adjacent to the Small Magellanic Cloud, the latter is some distant, being over fifteen times farther than 47 Tuc. The core of 47 Tuc was the subject of a major survey for planets, using the Hubble Space Telescope to look for partial eclipses of stars by their planets. No planets were found, though ten to fifteen were expected based on the rate of planet discoveries around stars near the Sun. This indicates that planets are relatively rare in globular clusters. A later ground-based survey in the uncrowded outer regions of the cluster also failed to detect planets when several were expected. This strongly indicates that the low metallicity of the environment, rather than the crowding, is responsible. Multiple stellar populations in 47 Tucanae 47 Tucanae contains at least two stellar populations of stars, of different ages or metallicities. The dense core contains a number of exotic stars of scientific interest, including at least 21 blue stragglers. Globular clusters efficiently sort stars by mass, with the most massive stars falling to the center. 47 Tucanae contains hundreds of X-ray sources, including stars with enhanced chromospheric activity due to their presence in binary star systems, cataclysmic variable stars containing white dwarfs accreting from companion stars, and low-mass X-ray binaries containing neutron stars that are not currently accreting, but can be observed by the X-rays emitted from the hot surface of the neutron star. 47 Tucanae has 25 known millisecond pulsars, the second largest population of pulsars in any globular cluster. These pulsars are thought to be spun up by the accretion of material from binary companion stars, in a previous X-ray binary phase. The companion of one pulsar in 47 Tucanae, 47 Tuc W, seems to still be transferring mass towards the neutron star, indicating that this system is completing a transition from being an accreting low-mass X-ray binary to a millisecond pulsar. X-ray emission has been individually detected from most millisecond pulsars in 47 Tucanae with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, likely emission from the neutron star surface, and gamma-ray emission has been detected with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope from its millisecond pulsar population (making 47 Tucanae the first globular cluster to be detected in gamma-rays). = Central black hole?= It is not yet clear whether 47 Tucanae hosts a central black hole. Hubble Space Telescope data constrain the mass of any possible black hole at the cluster's center to be less than approximately 1,500 solar masses. However, in February, 2017, astronomers announced that a black hole of some 2,200 solar masses may be located in the cluster; the researchers detected the black hole's signature from the motions and distributions of pulsars in the cluster. However, a recent analysis of an updated and more extensive timing data set on these pulsars provides no solid evidence in favor of the existence of a black hole. Modern discoveries In December 2008, Ragbir Bhathal of the University of Western Sydney claimed the detection of a strong laser-like signal from the direction of 47 Tucanae. In May 2015, the first evidence of the process of mass segregation in this globular cluster was announced. The cluster's Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram suggests stars approximately 13 billion years old, which is unusually old.

Though it is not stressed in Okinawa, nearly all Japanese-influenced kata start and end on exactly the same embusen point (Kiten). This word is also commonly romanized as enbusen. The embusen line varies for each series of kata. It is, for example, a straight line for the Sh≈çt≈çkan Tekki series of kata. It follows the form of a capital letter I for the Heian series of kata, as well as for the Taikyoku series. More advanced kata, such as Shotokan's Kanku-Dai and Goj≈´shiho Dai and Sho kata, as well as the G≈çj≈´-ry≈´ Seipai and Kururumfa kata, for example, have increasingly more complex embusen to train the practitioner in more advanced defensive angles and footwork. For any kata, the embusen is fixed and must be followed exactly for proper mastery of the style.  The rule of embusen  Japanese Kata are mostly arranged to start and end on or around the same point. Many were modified from their original Okinawan versions to accomplish this feat. The purpose of this is simply to allow the movements to be practiced in a small training space. The rule of embusen is that any movements in one direction should be symmetrical and countered by an equivalent number of movements in the opposite direction. In Okinawan karate the maximum number of steps in any direction is normally three. Karate kata will typically proceed along lines of embusen and start and finish on the kiten.

He was an early member of Edward R. Murrow's group of foreign correspondents that was known as the \\"Murrow Boys\\". During World War II he covered Europe and North Africa for CBS News. Collingwood was also among the early ranks of television journalists that included Walter Cronkite, Eric Sevareid, and Murrow himself.Olson, Lynne and Cloud, Stanley W. The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism. October 31, 1997. Mariner Books. . Early life Collingwood was born in Three Rivers, Michigan. He attended Deep Springs College and graduated from Cornell University. In 1939, he received a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford University. World War II 1943 portrait of war correspondent Charles Collingwood (Henry Carr) Collingwood covered World War II for United Press in London and was soon recruited to CBS by Edward R. Murrow in 1941. He established himself as an urbane and spontaneously-eloquent on-air journalist. In 1942, Collingwood was sent to cover the North African Campaign, where he proved his reporting abilities despite being considered \\"green\\" as a broadcast journalist. On D-Day, he landed at Utah Beach hours after the first wave of soldiers had hit the beaches. Of the CBS reporters accompanying the ground invasion, he recorded a report on June 6 that made it to broadcast two days later. The other CBS correspondents on the ground, Bill Downs and Larry LeSueur, were not able to deliver reports until days later because of trouble setting up mobile transmitters. When General Omar Bradley told Collingwood that the French Resistance was about to rise up and liberate Paris, Collingwood prepared and sent a recording with news of the liberation to CBS in London so that it would be ready when the city was actually freed. The recording bore a label that said to hold it back until Paris was actually liberated, but the technician at CBS did not read the label and immediately aired the recording. On that day, August 22, there were still thousands of German troops in Paris, and the Resistance fighters who were fighting and dying did not appreciate that the world was told that Paris had been liberated. The city would not be actually liberated until three days later, on August 25. Later career After the war, Collingwood remained with CBS and established himself as a television journalist. One of his first roles on television was as host of the CBS documentary series Adventure, which was produced in collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History.Terrace, Vincent (1976). The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947-1976 (Vol. 1). South Brunswick and New York: A.S. Barnes and Company. . He went on to become the chief correspondent of CBS and host of its Eyewitness to History series. In 1959 he succeeded Edward R. Murrow as host of Person to Person. He was a leading figure in CBS's expansion to include international coverage, and was CBS News's first United Nations correspondent. He later served as the network's White House correspondent. Collingwood accompanied then-First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy on a televised tour of the White House which she had renovated during the first year of the presidency of her husband, United States President John F. Kennedy. The resulting program, A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F. Kennedy, was broadcast on Valentine's Day in 1962 and was seen by 80 million viewers and broadcast in 50 countries, including Russia and China. He served as substitute anchor during portions of CBS's coverage of the Kennedy assassination on November 22, 1963, relieving Walter Cronkite only minutes after Cronkite had announced the official confirmation of Kennedy's death. Collingwood was CBS's chief foreign correspondent from 1964 to 1975, covering warfare in Southeast Asia. In 1968, he became the first US reporter allowed into North Vietnam. The inspiration for Collingwood's 1970 espionage novel The Defector largely came from this visit. The book received critical praise for its merits as a thriller and for its insights into the complexities of the Vietnam War. Personal life Collingwood retired in 1982. He was married to actress Louise Allbritton from 1946 until she died of cancer in 1979. He married the Swedish singer Tatiana Angelini-Jolin (n√©e Scheremetiew) (1923-2006) in 1984.

The principal thinkers in this tradition are Ren√© Gu√©non, Ananda Coomaraswamy and Frithjof Schuon. Other important thinkers in this tradition include Titus Burckhardt, Martin Lings, Jean-Louis Michon, Marco Pallis, Huston Smith, Hossein Nasr, Jean Borella, and Julius Evola. Concept According to the Traditionalists, there are primordial and universal religious truths which are at the foundations of all major world religions. The Traditionalists speak of \\"absolute Truth and infinite Presence\\". Absolute Truth is \\"the perennial wisdom (sophia perennis) that stands as the transcendent source of all the intrinsically orthodox religions of humankind.\\" According to Traditionalists, \\"the primordial and perennial truth\\" is manifested in a variety of religious and spiritual traditions. Infinite Presence is \\"the perennial religion (religio perennis) that lives within the heart of all intrinsically orthodox religions.\\" According to Frithjof Schuon, Although the Traditionalist school is often said to be a \\"perennial philosophy\\", its members prefer the term sophia perennis (\\"perennial wisdom\\"). According to Frithjof Schuon, The Traditionalist vision of a perennial wisdom is not based on mystical experiences, but on metaphysical intuitions. It is \\"intuited directly through divine intellect.\\" This divine intellect is different from reason, and makes it possible to discern \\"the sacred unity of reality that is attested in all authentic esoteric expressions of tradition\\"; it is \\"the presence of divinity within each human waiting to be uncovered.\\" According to Frithjof Schuon, Traditionalists discern a transcendent and an immanent dimension, namely the discernment of the Real or Absolute, c.q. that which is permanent; and the intentional \\"mystical concentration on the Real\\". According to the Traditionalists, this truth has been lost in the modern world through the rise of novel secular philosophies stemming from the Enlightenment,Daniel J Schwindt, The Case Against the Modern World: A Crash Course in Traditionalist Thought, 2016. and modernity itself is considered as an \\"anomaly in the history of mankind.\\" Traditionalists see their approach as a justifiable \\"nostalgia for the past\\". According to Frithjof Schuon, Traditionalists insist on the necessity for affiliation to one of the \\"normal traditions\\", or great ancient religions of the world. The regular affiliation to the ordinary life of a believer is crucial, since this could give access to the esoterism of that given religious form. People The ideas of the Traditionalist School are considered to begin with Ren√© Gu√©non. Other people considered Traditionalists include Titus Burckhardt, Jean Borella, Ananda Coomaraswamy, Martin Lings, Jean-Louis Michon, Marco Pallis, Drago≈° Kalajiƒá, Huston Smith, Hossein Nasr, Frithjof Schuon and Julius Evola. =Ren√© Gu√©non= A major theme in the works of Ren√© Gu√©non (1886-1951) is the contrast between traditional world views and modernity, \\"which he considered to be an anomaly in the history of mankind.\\" For Gu√©non, the physical world was a manifestation of metaphysical principles, which are preserved in the perennial teachings of the world religions, but were lost to the modern world. For Gu√©non, \\"the malaise of the modern world lies in its relentless denial of the metaphysical realm.\\" Early on, Gu√©non was attracted to Sufism, which he saw as a more accessible path of spiritual knowledge. In 1912 Gu√©non was initiated in the Shadhili order. He started writing after his doctoral dissertation was rejected, and he left academia in 1923. His works center on the return to these traditional world views, trying to reconstruct the Perennial Philosophy. In his first books and essays he envisaged a restoration of traditional \\"intellectualit√©\\" in the West on the basis of Roman Catholicism and Freemasonry. He gave up early on a purely Christian basis for a traditionalist restoration of the West, searching for other traditions. He denounced the lure of Theosophy and neo-occultism in the form of Spiritism, two influential movements that were flourishing in his lifetime. In 1930 he moved to Egypt, where he lived until his death in 1951. Influence Traditionalism had a discrete impact in the field of comparative religion,Oxford University Press, Description: \\"Against the Modern World. Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century\\" particularly on the young Mircea Eliade, although he was not himself a member of this school. Contemporary scholars such as Huston Smith, William Chittick, Harry Oldmeadow, James Cutsinger and Hossein Nasr have advocated Perennialism as an alternative to secularist approach to religious phenomena. Through the close affiliation with Sufism, the traditionalist perspective has been gaining ground in Asia and the Islamic world at large. =Iran= In Iran it was introduced by Hossein Nasr as well, earlier, by Ali Shariati, the intellectual considered the ideologue of the Iranian revolution who recommended Gu√©non to his students, and while it never acquired a \\"mass following\\", its influence on the √©lite can be measured by the fact that when Ayatollah Khomeini organized the Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution, out of the seven members designed to serve it three were acquainted with Traditionalist ideas, namely Abdolkarim Soroush, Reza Davari Ardakani and Nasrullah PourJavadi.Mark Sedgwick, \\"Traditionalism in Iran\\" in Politica Hermetica, n¬∞ 16 (2002), p. 137 =Pakistan= Hasan Askari, an important writer and literary critic, was directly influenced by Gu√©non, and, through him, Muhammad Shafi Deobandi and his son Muhammad Taqi Usmani, some of the country's most influential Islamic scholars, integrated Gu√©non's works in the curriculum of the Darul Uloom Karachi, one of the most important madrassa or religious seminary in the country.Michel Valsan, Gu√©non‚Äôs work in Orient (excerpt) Other important figures of Pakistan influenced by Traditionalism include A. K. Brohi, who was seen as close to General Zia-ul-Haq, and psychologist Muhammad Ajmal. Association with far right movements Although not a prominent figure of the Traditionalist School, the ideas of Julius Evola have been associated with some far right movements, such as the European Nouvelle Droite (\\"New Right\\"), and Italian Fascists during the Years of Lead. Mark Sedgwick's Against the Modern World, published in 2004, gives an analysis of the Traditionalist School and its political influence. Various influential figures in twenty- first century far-right populist movements have affiliated with Traditionalism, often with Evola in particular. According to the book War for Eternity by Benjamin R. Teitelbaum, former Donald Trump advisor Steve Bannon, Russian ideologue Aleksandr Dugin, and advisor to Jair Bolsonaro Olavo de Carvalho all have associated with Traditionalism and have interacted with each other based on those interests. In his book Gu√©non ou le renversement des clart√©s, the French scholar Xavier Accart questions the connection sometimes made between the Traditionalist School and far-right politics. According to Accart, Ren√© Guenon was highly critical of Evola's political involvements and was worried about the possible confusion between his own ideas and Evola's. Accart finally claims that the assimilation of Gu√©non with Evola and the confusion between Traditionalism and the New Right can be traced back to Louis Pauwels and Bergier's The Morning of the Magicians (1960). Alain de Benoist, the founder of the Nouvelle Droite declared in 2013 that the influence of Gu√©non on his political school was very weak and that he does not consider him as a major author.

C. Escher, first printed in October 1961. It shows a perpetual motion machine where water from the base of a waterfall appears to run downhill along the water path before reaching the top of the waterfall. While most two-dimensional artists use relative proportions to create an illusion of depth, Escher here and elsewhere uses conflicting proportions to create a visual paradox. The watercourse supplying the waterfall (its aqueduct or leat) has the structure of two Penrose triangles. A Penrose triangle is an impossible object designed by Oscar Reutersv√§rd in 1934, and found independently by Roger Penrose in 1958. Description The image depicts a watermill with an elevated aqueduct and waterwheel as the main feature. The aqueduct begins at the waterwheel and flows behind it. The walls of the aqueduct step downward, suggesting that it slopes downhill. The aqueduct turns sharply three times, first to the left, then to the right, and finally to the left again. The viewer looks down at the scene diagonally, which means that from the viewer's perspective the aqueduct appears to be slanted upward. The viewer is also looking across the scene diagonally from the lower right, which means that from the viewer's perspective the two left-hand turns are directly in line with each other, while the waterwheel, the forward turn and the end of the aqueduct are all in line. The second left-hand turn is supported by pillars from the first, while the other two corners are supported by a tower of pillars that begins at the waterwheel. The water falls off the edge of the aqueduct and over the waterwheel in an impossible infinite cycle; in his notes on the picture, Escher points out that some water must be periodically added to this perpetual motion machine to compensate for evaporation. The use of the Penrose stairs is paralleled by Escher's Ascending and Descending (1960), where instead of the flow of water, two lines of monks endlessly march uphill or downhill around the four flights of stairs. The two support towers continue above the aqueduct and are topped by two compound polyhedra, revealing Escher's interest in mathematics as an artist. The one on the left is a compound of three cubes. The one on the right is a stellation of a rhombic dodecahedron (or a compound of three non-regular octahedra) and is known as Escher's solid. Below the mill is a garden of bizarre, giant plants. This is a magnified view of a cluster of moss and lichen that Escher drew in ink as a study in 1942. The background seems to be a climbing expanse of terraced farmland.

Chronicling the Jesus Freak Tour in the spring of 1996, they were released separately two months apart in 1997 on CD and VHS, respectively. A DVD version was later released in 2003. Each version has been certified gold by the RIAA (audio for 500,000 units and video for 50,000 units sold). Track listings differ slightly between the two. Select videos included a bonus audio disc that remains one of the rarest recordings in the DC Talk catalog. The audio version won the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album.

This placed it at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 chart. Anticipation was already high for the scheduled 65-city tour set to begin in the Spring of 1996, but DC Talk's record label, ForeFront Records launched a massive marketing blitz to increase awareness. The tour debuted to a sold-out crowd at the Bren Center on the University of California Irvine campus.Granger, Thom. \\"100% Pure Adrenaline.\\" Release Magazine. May/June 1996. It later included stops in several European countries (which is documented in the video). Audio Adrenaline opened for DC Talk on the tour.  Audio version  The audio version was recorded in the Pacific Northwest, more specifically in Portland, Oregon and Tacoma, Washington, as evidenced by the band dialogue in several places, such as following \\"Like It, Love It, Need It\\" (Michael and Kevin banter about what they like about Seattle). Of notable absence is \\"Just Between You and Me\\" which was the album's biggest mainstream hit. This song's rise on the Billboard charts was a result of the partnership with Virgin Records that came after the close of the tour. \\"Between You and Me\\" was not played until the last dates of the tour, which was after this recording had taken place. =Track listing= = Awards / Recognition = The audio recording was awarded the 1997 Grammy Award for \\"Best Rock Gospel Album\\".

It was discovered by James Dunlop on 1 July 1826, who catalogued it as Œî252.Classic Deep-Sky and Double Stars : NGC 5189 (Mus) Southern Astronomical Delights For many years, well into the 1960s, it was thought to be a bright emission nebula. It was Karl Gordon Henize in 1967 who first described NGC 5189 as quasi-planetary based on its spectral emissions. Seen through the telescope it seems to have an S shape, reminiscent of a barred spiral galaxy. The S shape, together with point-symmetric knots in the nebula, have for a long time hinted to astronomers that a binary central star is present. The Hubble Space Telescope imaging analysis showed that this S shape structure is indeed two dense low-ionization regions: one moving toward the north-east and another one moving toward the south-west of the nebula, which could be a result of a recent outburst from the central star. Observations with the Southern African Large Telescope have finally found a white dwarf companion in a 4.04 day orbit around the rare low-mass Wolf-Rayet type central star of NGC 5189. NGC 5189 is estimated to be 546 parsecs or 1,780 light years away from Earth.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 19, 1995. The plot focuses on Lisa visiting a carnival fortune teller and learning about her future love. It was written by Greg Daniels and directed by Jim Reardon. Mandy Patinkin guest stars as Hugh Parkfield and Phil Hartman guest stars as Troy McClure. The episode won an Emmy Award in 1995 for Outstanding Animated Program, becoming the third episode of The Simpsons to win the award.Episode Capsule at The Simpsons Archive Plot The Simpson family visit a Renaissance fair, where Lisa finds a fortune-telling booth. She says she will predict Lisa's future and tell the story of her true love. In the year 2010 -- 15 years in the future -- then 23-year-old Lisa meets a fellow university student named Hugh Parkfield from London. The pair fall madly in love and soon plan to marry. Lisa and Hugh travel to Springfield, where they plan to hold the wedding. Despite Lisa's hopes, Hugh does not get along with her family; he is particularly dismayed when Homer wants him to wear family-tradition cufflinks resembling pigs on his wedding day. Lisa begs Hugh to wear the cufflinks and he agrees on the condition that Lisa abandon her family after the wedding because Hugh is deeply embarrassed by them. Outraged, Lisa insists she cannot marry him if he cannot understand that she loves her family members -- despite their shortcomings -- and calls off the wedding. In the present, the fortune teller reveals that Hugh returned to England and never saw Lisa again. Lisa questions the fortune teller about her \\"true love\\" and the fortune teller reveals that although Lisa will have a true love, she \\"specializes in foretelling relationships where you get jerked around\\". Lisa leaves the booth and finds her father, who is excited to tell her about his day at the fair. Production The idea for the episode came from James L. Brooks, who called David Mirkin and pitched the idea as traveling to the future and Lisa meeting the perfect guy, who in turn cannot stand her family. Believing that it would be a tough episode to write, Brooks gave the job to Greg Daniels, who was enthusiastic about it and has said that it was a lot easier and more fun to write than expected. The plot involving Homer's cuff links was not in the original draft; it was later added because the writers felt that something was needed to represent Hugh's disdain for the Simpson family. The end theme was redone by Alf Clausen as a \\"Renaissance version\\", including a harp. Homer talks to Lisa on the morning of her wedding. For the episode, many characters were given special aged designs. In Homer's case, he was made larger with some extra lines on his face and less hair. Everything in the episode had to be redesigned, including the sets and all of the characters. In most cases, the adults were made older, heavier, had a few lines added to the face, and less hair. On Homer, the redesign was minimal, making him a bit heavier, removing one hair and placing an extra line under the eye. Krusty's design is based on Groucho Marx. The night sky was intentionally made a more reddish color in a subtle joke about how the producers thought the world would be much more polluted in 2010. Nancy Cartwright's Bart voice was electronically lowered a couple of notches. This is the first of five future-themed episodes. The others were \\"Bart to the Future\\" in season 11, \\"Future-Drama\\" in season 16, \\"Holidays of Future Passed\\" in season 23, and \\"Days of Future Future\\" in season 25. While both \\"Lisa's Wedding\\" and \\"Future-Drama\\" were nominated for an Emmy, in 2003, Entertainment Weekly named \\"Bart to the Future\\" the worst episode in the history of the series. Cultural references The episode makes mention of \\"40 classic films starring Jim Carrey\\". According to David Mirkin, this is a joke about how \\"huge\\" Carrey's films were at the time, and how he was not garnering much respect as an actor. The sounds of the car are the same as the ones used in The Jetsons. Wrist communicators are using the same sounds as communicators in Star Trek. In this episode's version of the future, apparently three of the major American television networks have been bought by ABC and merged into CNNBCBS. At the same time, Fox has gradually become a hardcore sex channel. Hugh Parkfield is a parody of English actor Hugh Grant. The beginning of Lisa and Hugh's romance is similar to the one in the 1970 film Love Story. Martin Prince's fate is a parody of The Phantom of the Opera. The song that he plays on the organ is a variation of \\"A Fifth of Beethoven\\" by Walter Murphy, a disco version of Beethoven's \\"Symphony No. 5\\" in C Minor. Hugh mentions that he and Lisa are \\"both utterly humorless about our vegetarianism\\"; in the next season's episode, \\"Lisa the Vegetarian,\\" Lisa does indeed become a vegetarian and remains one for subsequent episodes. Reception and legacy Various publications have named Mandy Patinkin as one of the series' best guest stars In its original broadcast, \\"Lisa's Wedding\\" finished 52nd in ratings for the week of March 13‚Äì19, 1995, with a Nielsen rating of 9.1, equivalent to approximately 8.7 million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Beverly Hills, 90210 and Melrose Place. \\"Lisa's Wedding\\" won an Emmy Award in 1995 for Outstanding Animated Program, becoming the third episode of The Simpsons to win in the category. This episode is a favorite of James L. Brooks, who believes that it is one of the best-written episodes and ranks near the top of The Simpsons episodes. The emotion of \\"Lisa's Wedding\\" is often compared with season two's \\"Lisa's Substitute\\". The Quindecim, a college newspaper, made their own top 25 list, ranking \\"Lisa's Wedding\\" as the greatest episode of The Simpsons. They also criticized Entertainment Weekly for leaving this episode and \\"Lisa's Substitute\\" off their top 25 list, saying it was the \\"equivalent of leaving the Sistine Chapel off a list of Michelangelo's best work\\", adding, \\"Serving well as bookends, these episodes are not only brilliantly funny, they're among the most genuinely touching stories in the show's entire run.\\" Mandy Patinkin as Hugh is considered one of the best The Simpsons guest spots by Chris Turner in his book Planet Simpson, who says that many of the best The Simpsons guest stars have been lesser known celebrities. In a 2008 article, Entertainment Weekly named Patinkin one of the 16 best The Simpsons guest stars. In 1998, TV Guide listed it as the first in its list of top twelve episodes, calling it \\"the premier example of what makes a Simpsons episode work.\\" In 2007, The Daily Telegraph characterized the episode as one of \\"The 10 Best Simpsons TV Episodes\\". On August 1, 2010, the day of Lisa's wedding in the episode, the name \\"Lisa Simpson\\" was a trending topic on Twitter. Most of the Twitter users that tweeted her name wished her a happy wedding day.

Both galaxies are located approximately 25 million light-years away in the constellation Canes Venatici. Together, the two galaxies are one of the most famous interacting galaxy pairs. History NGC 5195 was discovered by Pierre M√©chain on March 20, 1781. Interaction with the Whirlpool Galaxy NGC 5195 and the Whirlpool Galaxy compose one of the most noted interacting galaxy pairs in astronomy. The two galaxies are listed in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies as one of several prominent examples of a spiral galaxy with a companion galaxy. The system was also the subject of very early theoretical investigations into galaxy interactions. The two galaxies are connected by a dust-rich tidal bridge. The dust in this tidal bridge can be seen silhouetted against the center of NGC 5195. This demonstrates that NGC 5195 appears to lie behind the Whirlpool Galaxy. The encounter has significantly enhanced the spiral structure of M51. In January 2016, BBC science reporter Jonathan Webb said, \\"Astronomers have spotted two huge waves of gas being 'burped' by the black hole at the heart of a nearby galaxy. The swathes of hot gas, detected in X-ray images from NASA's Chandra space telescope, appear to be sweeping cooler hydrogen gas ahead of them. This vast, rippling belch is taking place in NGC 5195 - a small, neglected sibling of the 'Whirlpool Galaxy', 26 million light years away. That makes it one of the closest black holes blasting gas in this way\\". He added, \\"The findings, presented at the 227th meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) in Florida, are a dramatic example of 'feedback' between a supermassive black hole and its host galaxy\\". Webb's report cited Marie Machacek, co-author of the study from the Harvard‚ÄìSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CFA), as saying, \\"We think that feedback keeps galaxies from becoming too large [‚Ä¶] But at the same time, it can be responsible for how some stars form. This shows that black holes can create, not just destroy.\\" Morphology As a consequence of the gravitational interaction with the Whirlpool Galaxy, NGC 5195 is highly distorted. Classification of its morphology is difficult, as it is sometimes identified as a lenticular galaxy or as an amorphous or irregular galaxy. It has been described as falling outside the standard morphological classification system. Supernova Supernova 1945A is the only supernova that has been detected within NGC 5195. The supernova was found 10‚Ä≥ northwest of the nucleus on April 6, 1945 by Milton L. Humason using the telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory. The supernova, classified as a Type I supernova, reached a peak apparent magnitude of 14.0.

It is geared toward increasing voter turnout among voters ages 18 to 24. Rock the Vote is known for its celebrity spokespeople and its partnership with MTV. History Rock the Vote was founded in 1990 by Jeff Ayeroff with Virgin America co Chair Jordan Harris and Virgin Executive Beverly Lund. Later they hired Jodi Uttal and then Steve Barr, a campaign worker and political fundraiser, who became \\"co-founders\\" for their contribution to Rock the Vote. Rock the Vote supported the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, commonly referred to as the \\"motor voter\\" bill, which expanded access to voter registration. It was signed into law by President Bill Clinton. The law requires state governments to offer voter registration opportunities to any eligible person who applies for or renews a driver's license or public assistance. In 1996, Rock the Vote created the first telephone voter registration system, 1-800-REGISTER, followed by the first online voter-registration system, NetVote, later that year. \\"We supported Rock the Vote,\\" said Radiohead's Thom Yorke, \\"but ‚Äì because of the way the whole political system works ‚Äì it does seem rather odd to be choosing between one unworkable, outdated system and another. We need to go beyond that ‚Äì because, at the moment, it's just Cowboys and Indians.\\" With CNN, Rock the Vote organized \\"America Rocks the Vote,\\" a 2003 Democratic presidential candidates forum at Faneuil Hall in Boston. Rock the Vote has expressed support for a public health insurance option. It signed on to Health Care for America NOW!, a progressive political coalition that supported passage of the Affordable Care Act. In 2009, Rock the Vote ran a campaign encouraging people to refuse to have sex with those who opposed what they regarded as a reform of American health care. During the 2004 presidential election, Rock the Vote drew criticism from Republican Party officials such as Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie for sending a mock draft notice to over 600,000 e-mail addresses. The message included the words \\"Selective Service System\\" and read \\"You are hereby ordered for induction into the Armed Forces of the United States, and to report to a polling place near you\\" on November 2, (Election Day). The Rock the Vote logo and a facsimile of Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's signature appeared at the bottom of the message. In addition, Rock the Vote created public service announcements featuring the subject of the draft. Besides making the PSAs available to large cable systems, they also paid to run them on a random sample of small cable systems where they could measure the effects. Turnout was three percentage points higher among 18-19-year olds in these sample areas than in the control group covered by other similar small cable systems; there was less effect above age 22. According to the Los Angeles Times, Rock the Vote experienced financial problems in the aftermath of the 2004 election. It emerged from the election $700,000 in debt, and its president resigned in the summer of 2005 \\"amid disagreements about the organization's direction.\\" In 2008, Rock the Vote's youth vote registration drive resulted in 2.6 million young voters registered. In November 2012 and 2013 Rock the Vote experimented with Facebook ads to encourage voter turnout by telling people the number of days remaining until the election and which of their friends \\"liked\\" the countdown. The ads were shown to over 400,000 adults, randomly selected from a base over 800,000. Rock the Vote had helped many of them register. The ads did not increase turnout in the experimental group, compared to the control group who did not get the ads. In 2012 they also experimented with text message reminders to 180,000 people who had provided their mobile numbers. Texts the day before the election raised turnout six tenths of a percentage point, while texts on election day lowered turnout. In advance of the 2014 elections, Rock the Vote released a video titled \\"Turn Out For What.\\" It was a parody of Lil Jon and DJ Snake's song \\"Turn Down for What\\". The video sought to encourage youth voter turnout and featured reproductive rights, marijuana legalization, global warming, LGBT rights, student debt, gun control and deforestation as reasons why young people might want to vote. The video was criticized for having a disproportionate representation of left-wing political issues. The video was also criticized because several of the celebrities who appeared in it, including Lena Dunham, Whoopi Goldberg, Natasha Lyonne and Darren Criss, had not voted in the previous midterm election. The day after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Rock the Vote President and Executive Director Carolyn DeWitt issued a statement on behalf of the organization expressing disappointment with the election of Donald Trump and Republican Party congressional victories, writing \\"This is a jarring day for Millennial voters, who voted overwhelmingly for Secretary Clinton and for progressive candidates down the ticket...we woke up this morning with full hearts and piercing focus, not just on the next national election in two short years, but on putting the needs of young people, people of color and others feeling under siege, front and center for our new president and the 115th Congress.\\" In 2019, DeWitt spoke out in favor of abolishing the United States Electoral College. Democracy Class Rock the Vote: Democracy Class is a program put on by Rock the Vote. It is designed to educate high school students about voting, elections and governance. The lesson plan uses music, pop culture, video, classroom discussion and a mock election to teach young people the skills to navigate the elections process and engage as active citizens. On Democracy Day 2011, teachers in all 50 states committed to teaching Democracy Class in more than 1,100 classrooms. High school students in Democracy Classes participate in mobile polls that assess their viewpoints on public policy issues.

It was established in 1841.  History  Samuel Williston. Williston Seminary was founded by Samuel Williston (1795‚Äì1874), a wealthy button manufacturer, in February 1841; the school opened that December, with a dedication address by Mark Hopkins, president of nearby Williams College. The idea of opening a new academy in the neighborhood had been in the air ever since the closing in 1834 of the Round Hill School in nearby Northampton. In its early days, there was no arrangement of studies by terms and the students were not classified. Luther Wright, its principal from 1841 to 1849, believed it was desirable to have his pupils study together in a single room under his direction. However, the school's student population grew rapidly and the one-room schoolhouse scheme was soon no longer practicable, as more instructors and new buildings were added. By the 1850s the schools campus was dominated by three large buildings: North Hall, Middle Hall and South Hall. For many years the school was co-educational, with the students divided and taught separately in male and female departments, but in 1864 the female division was discontinued. The seminary comprised two faculties: classical and scientific. With the departure in 1863 of the school's second president, Josiah Clark, a classicist Greek and Latin scholar who had vigorously fought against the expansion of the English department, the school's curriculum began to be modernized. Samuel Williston remained the dominant influence in the school's growth until his death in 1874. In the late 19th century the dual curricula had evolved into a more modern comprehensive course (e.g. with \\"scientific and preparatory departments\\", and in 1924 the school was renamed Williston Academy. During the 1960s Williston began to examine possibilities for coeducation, and in 1971, merged with its longtime sister school, the Northampton School for Girls, to become the Williston Northampton School. Starting as a preparatory academy for those seeking the clergy, the school now integrates a core college preparatory curriculum with electives and special opportunities, while emphasizing mastery of language, clarity of thought and academic integrity.  Students and faculty  Old Campus, Williston. Williston Northampton encompasses the middle school (7th and 8th grade) and the upper school (9th-12th and postgraduate). The school had 486 students in the 2017-2018 academic year with 58.6 teachers on a full-time equivalent basis, and a student‚Äìteacher ratio of 8.3. Its boarding students come from 25 states and 30 countries around the world. International students come from eastern Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Most teachers also take on the roles of dorm parents, advisors, and athletics coaches, fostering deep relationships with students. Arts programs at Williston include photography, filmmaking, drawing, painting, theatre, and dance. According to the school, 62% of students taking the 2009 AP exams scored 4 or 5, and 51 members of the class of 2009 gained admission at Barron's 75 most competitive colleges. Over a ten- year period, six students were published in The Concord Review.  The campus  Ford Hall and Birch Dining Commons, viewed from the Williston pond. The campus is located in Easthampton, Massachusetts, within view of Mount Tom. Many of the school's buildings and dorms are situated around the main quad. In 2017, construction began on a new dorm across from the main part of campus. The Schoolhouse, a former factory building remodeled in the 1950s to resemble the old schoolhouse building on the original Main Street campus, holds English and math classes and also contains administrative offices. In 1996, the former gymnasium, originally built in 1924, was transformed into the Reed Campus Center. In 2019, the athletic center was named the Sabina Cain Family Athletic Center. The Dodge Room is the setting for many guest speakers, including the school's Writers' Workshop series. After a fire destroyed the school's theater building in 1994, it was rebuilt adjacent to the science laboratories, Scott Hall. The Williston Theatre is a 250-seat performance space. The Robert Clapp Memorial Library is located near the center of the campus. The library has a 40,000+ collection. The Middle School is housed in the Whitaker-Bement Center. It was created in 1972 in honor of the Northampton School for Girls founders Sarah B. Whitaker and Dorothy M. Bement. The Phillips Stevens Chapel (1964) hosts both the weekly assembly in its traditional chapel and language classes in its basement.  Life at Williston  The school year begins in September and usually ends in the first week of June. Each student typically takes five classes at a time. 27 courses may be taken at Advanced Placement (AP) level. Classes begin at 8:30 a.m. and end in the early afternoon, when many students head off to their athletic practices. Upper school students attend Saturday classes every other week.  Athletics  Sabina Cain Family Athletic Center. Students are required to participate in after-school sports, although they may choose an alternative elective course. The facilities support the program's 63 teams played in 30 sports.  Williston traditions  Lion mascot statue. A tradition at the Williston Northampton School is the painting of the school lion. At least several times a year, students spray paint the statue of a lion on the center of campus. The student newspaper, The Willistonian, is the longest continuously published high school newspaper in the country.  School song  Sheet music for \\"O Williston\\". The school's alma mater, O Williston, made its debut on September 14, 2007, and is performed at formal occasions such as Convocation and Baccalaureate. New lyrics were set to an 1867 hymn by Henry Smart. Other school songs include \\"Sammy\\", which refers to founding headmaster Samuel Williston. The \\"Williston Hymn\\" was a standby at the beginning and end of year assemblies, as well as at the Cum Laude assembly, for many decades, but was discontinued sometime in the 2000s. The tune of the hymn was that of the German national anthem, \\"Deutschlandlied\\". Long before Germany adopted it, the melody was composed by Joseph Haydn as \\"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\\", an anthem to Francis II of Austria. In 1797, Haydn incorporated it into the second movement of his Emperor Quartet, op. 76, no. 3.

Set in 1973 Santiago during Salvador Allende's socialist government until shortly after General Augusto Pinochet's military coup in 1973, the film tells the story of two pupils: Gonzalo Infante comes from a rich family with a European background, while Pedro Machuca comes from an indigenous background and lives in very poor conditions. They meet at an elite, English-language Catholic school, where the director, Father McEnroe, is developing a social integration project. The film is dedicated to Father Gerardo Whelan, C.S.C. who from 1969 to 1973 was the director of Colegio Saint George (Saint George's College), the private school in Santiago that the film's director attended as a boy. The movie was filmed in July 2003 and produced on a moderate budget of 1,700,000 USD,https://www.imdb.com/reviews/392/39288.html which came from an international cooperation between Chile and Spain. Machuca performed well in theaters in Chile, but did not have notable box office success outside of Latin America. Plot The film is shown from the perspective of Gonzalo Infante, an 11 year upper middle-class Chilean boy, during a time period in which the lower classes demand more rights and fundamental change and have won the recent democratic election. Many from the middle and upper class, including members of Gonzalo's own family, grow fearful of the socialist movement and plot against the country's elected president, Salvador Allende. Gonzalo's father, while sympathetic to the poor and not part of the right-wing movement, wants to leave the country for Italy, where he frequently travels for work at the UN FAO. Gonzalo's mother, Maria Luisa Infante, is having an affair with a wealthy older Argentinian, Roberto Ochagavia, who gives Gonzalo gifts to keep him quiet. Gonzalo is sometimes bullied by his sister's boyfriend, who is a violent anti-Allende right-winger who uses nunchakus to intimidate people. The family often buys products from the black market, due to rationing and shortages. Gonzalo attends a private school where the strong- willed school principal, Father McEnroe, is developing a social integration project, which is seen by some parents as left leaning rather than a work of the Christian faith. When five poor students are admitted to Gonzalo's class, Gonzalo becomes friends with Pedro Machuca, one of the new students, after he refuses to participate in bullying by other pupils. Gonzalo accompanies Pedro and his neighbor Silvana as they sell flags and cigarettes at demonstrations: first nationalistic flags at a demonstration of right-wing nationalists, then flags of the red brigades at a leftist rally in support of the government. Silvana calls Gonzalo a snob and strawberry-face, but eventually befriends him and they even exchange first kisses. Pedro Machuca visits Gonzalo's home and is impressed at Gonzalo having a separate room with toys and a closet full of clothing, but also witnesses the tensions and cruelty latent in Gonzalo's family. When Gonzalo visits the shantytown dwelling of Pedro, he is appalled at the conditions. The friendship of the two mirrors the friendship between the Lone Ranger and the Indian Tonto in Gonzalo's favorite comic-book series. Gonzalo knows that he is acting against expectations, mentioning that his favorite comic is unbelievable because \\"Indians and white men do not team up.\\" As political unrest in Chile grows, the boys' friendship begins to be tested. Pedro's drunk father taunts him, telling him that, while Gonzalo and his friends will grow up wealthy, he will be stuck in the lower class cleaning toilets. The wealthy parents of the students at St. Patrick's school are divided on the issue of the new poor students. While some, such as Sr. Infante, support Father McEnroe's policies, many, including Sra. Infante, think that the classes should be segregated. The school farm run by the students is a failure and jeopardizes the financial basis for the inclusion of poorer students. At an anti-Communist political rally, Gonzalo's mother sticks up for Silvana when Silvana is threatened by the group that Gonzalo's mother is with‚Äîuntil Silvana spits on their car in retaliation and calls Gonzalo‚Äôs mother a whore. As the class tensions increase, the friends get into a fight and are driven apart. Gonzalo's family witnesses the military coup of 1973 led by Augusto Pinochet, in which Salvador Allende commits suicide and Augusto Pinochet takes over. After Father McEnroe is removed from the now militarized school, he attends the mass performed by a new priest, consumes the sacramental bread to save it from desecration and declares the ground to be desecrated. Machuca leads the other students in honoring the priest and is expelled. Gonzalo tries to visit the shantytown where Pedro and Silvana live but arrives to find it being destroyed by the soldiers. He then witnesses a soldier murdering Silvana. Himself being dragged into the conflict, Gonzalo convinces a soldier that he is not from the shantytown due to his nice clothing and fair complexion, and is forced to abandon his friend. He returns to his family's new home, which is now even more opulent thanks to his mother's lover and the new redistribution of wealth under the new government. He remains distraught over the events he has witnessed as he remembers his friends as he stares down at the ruins of their homes. The 17 years of Chilean dictatorship, in which 250,000 Chileans were detained, have begun.

He is the son of the series' main antagonist, Bowser. Since his debut in Super Mario Sunshine, Bowser Jr. has been a recurring character in the Mario series and has been made playable in several spin-offs, such as Mario Superstar Baseball, Mario Strikers Charged, and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He shares his father's desire to kidnap Princess Peach and defeat Mario. Bowser Jr. is generally not considered one of the Koopalings. Design and characteristics Bowser Jr. is a yellow-skinned Koopa similar to his father with the same yellow and tan skin complexion, as well as a light green head and a Top-ponytail of orange-red hair held by a black tie. He has one small tooth in his mouth and a large snout, as well as small circular eyes that are beady and black in color. His shell is lined with a green encasing with small white spikes. Junior typically wears a white bandana, decorated with a drawn-on mouth with fangs that is worn around his neck and occasionally over his mouth like a mask (however it is absent in Mario Strikers Charged, and he wore a blue mask with Mario's mustache in Super Mario Sunshine). Bowser Jr. also has two metal wristbands, while Bowser wears four that are all spiked. Like his father, Bowser Jr. can breathe fire and is physically powerful in spite of his small frame. His exact size varies from game to game; though in general he gradually gets taller, from being the smallest in Super Mario Sunshine to being larger than Princess Peach in Super Mario Galaxy. According to Mario Kart Wii, Bowser Jr. inherited his father's temper and bad attitude, evident in his motto (\\"Grin and bear it. When that don't work, grin and crush it.\\"). He is also bratty and spoiled yet revealed to be lonely, and wants to help his dad and \\"play hero\\", as said by Bowser in Mario Party: Island Tour. Bowser Jr. is not to be confused with \\"Baby Bowser\\", the infant version of Bowser as appears in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. Bowser Jr. was voiced by Dolores Rogers from 2002 to 2007. Then, Caety Sagoian took over the voice acting role for him since Mario Strikers Charged.Mario Strikers Charged staff roll Appearances Bowser Jr. in his \\"Shadow Mario\\" form as a doppelg√§nger of Mario in Super Mario Sunshine \\"Baby Bowser\\", the infant version of Bowser whose design bears a strong resemblance to Bowser Jr. had previously appeared in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, Yoshi's Story, and the Mario Party series. Bowser Jr. himself first appeared in Super Mario Sunshine, where he disguised as Shadow Mario and disrupted Mario's vacation with Princess Peach by painting the island of Isle Delfino with goop and then kidnapping her by framing Mario, after his father tricked him into thinking that Princess Peach was his mother whom he had to protect. Eventually he found out that Peach was not really his mother, but still wanted to get revenge on Mario. Bowser Jr. later appeared in New Super Mario Bros., in a role similar to Boom Boom from Super Mario Bros. 3, as the boss of every tower, the midpoint in each of the game's worlds as well as in the final battle with his father. Bowser Jr. appears in Super Mario Galaxy, aiding his father in battle, as well as having three worlds of his own. Alongside the Koopalings, Bowser Jr. re-appeared in the New Super Mario Bros. sequel, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, appearing on an airship. He also appears in Super Mario Galaxy 2, in the same way as in the original Galaxy. Bowser Jr. also appears in New Super Mario Bros. U, New Super Luigi U and New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe alongside his dad, the Koopalings, and Boom Boom. Bowser Jr. is a staple character in the various Mario spin-off games. Bowser Jr. appears in Mario Kart: Double Dash, Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and also appears in the Mario sports games. He also appears as a mini-boss in Mario Party 9 and is the host of his own board space, where he challenges two players to play a minigame with him. He is also a playable character in Mario Party: Island Tour. He also appears in every entry of the Mario & Sonic series as a member of Team Mario, beginning with Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games. Description: Bowser Jr. is the son of Bowser, but don't let that fool you. With the good balancing and the inherited hidden strength from his father, he's aiming for first place in these Olympic Games. Bowser Jr. made his RPG debut in Paper Mario: Sticker Star (as Paper Bowser Jr.) as one of the bosses. He also appeared in Mario & Luigi: Dream Team as a bonus boss in the Battle Ring. Bowser Jr. meets his paper counterpart, Paper Bowser Jr., in Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam. He also appeared in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey as a playable character in Bowser Jr.'s Journey, a side story of his adventure with the Koopalings. Bowser Jr. appears as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, fighting from atop his Junior Clown Car with Shadow Mario as his Final Smash. Each of his alternate costumes replaces him with one of the Koopalings.http://kotaku.com/people-are-starting-to-unlock-secret- smash-bros-charact-1633365911 Bowser Jr. appears in Super Mario Maker not just as a boss that Mario can fight in all game styles, but also as a Mystery Mushroom costume in the Super Mario Bros. style. Bowser Jr. appears along with his father in an official animated presentation video that promotes the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls app. Reception Since Bowser Jr.'s introduction in Super Mario Sunshine, reception to the character has been positive. He ranked sixth on GameDaily's list of the top 10 Nintendo characters that deserve their own games. They also listed him as the 18th best Mario enemy, calling him a \\"chip off the ol' block\\" from Bowser. In a satirical article written by Kotaku writer Chi Lee, Bowser Jr. was compared to North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, and compared the relationship of North Korea and South Korea with the fictional Mushroom Kingdom and Koopa Kingdom. Kotaku also listed Bowser as one of the worst fathers in video gaming, due to allowing Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings to run around with pirate ships and \\"zappy wands\\". GameSpy complained that Bowser Jr. was a \\"dopey successor\\" to the Koopalings which they liked more, and said that they have \\"far more charm\\" when compared to Bowser Jr. 1UP.com listed Fawful as a character they would want more in the Mario Kart series than Bowser Jr. and Waluigi, saying \\"Unfortunately, rather than exploring the true depth of the series and offering characters like Mario & Luigis Fawful, we get Bowser Jr. and Waluigi. Yeah, great.\\" Australia's Official Nintendo Magazine listed Bowser Jr. as one of the characters they want in Super Smash Bros. 4, as he would be a \\"fantastic inclusion\\".

He was the younger brother of the somewhat more influential composer Giovanni Maria Nanino. Life Born in Vallerano, he was first a boy soprano in the local cathedral, just like his brother. His first post may have been as maestro di cappella at Santa Maria dei Monti in 1588, and he is known to have acquired the post of maestro di cappella at San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome in 1591, after his brother left to join the papal choir. The two brothers, however, were living together at this time in a house owned by the church, and spent a good deal of their time teaching choirboys. Following the appointment at San Luigi dei Francesi, he was associated with Cardinal Montalto, a wealthy and influential patron of art and music, and may have served as teacher, composer, and archivist for the Cardinal at his church, San Lorenzo in Damaso. Works Nanino's music of the 1580s and 1590s is conservative in idiom, avoiding the experimental tendencies of his brother and Marenzio, preferring instead to incorporate the technique and expressive style of the earlier Roman composers such as Palestrina. After about 1610 he adopted the technique of basso continuo in his sacred works -- hardly a conservative tendency -- and, significantly, something his brother never did. Much of his earlier music is secular (such as madrigals), but he published several books of motets after 1610, after his brother's death. It is tempting to speculate that when he wrote music in the same format as his brother, he chose opposite stylistic means, and after his brother's death he quickly adopted the progressive style of the time, using it to write music in the same forms which his brother had used more conservatively.

Located at the head of the Chigmit Mountains subrange in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, the mountain is just west of Cook Inlet, in the Kenai Peninsula Borough about 110 miles (180 km) southwest of Anchorage. At 10,197 feet (3,108 m), in just over 5 miles (8 km) Mount Redoubt attains 9,150 feet (2,700 m) of prominence over its surrounding terrain. It is the highest summit in the Aleutian Range. In 1976, Redoubt Volcano was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. Active for millennia, Mount Redoubt has erupted four times since it was first observed: in 1902, 1966, 1989 and 2009, with two questionable eruptions in 1881 and 1933. The eruption in 1989 spewed volcanic ash to a height of . It caught KLM Flight 867, a Boeing 747 aircraft, in its plume. After the plane descended 13,000 feet, the pilots restarted the engines and landed the plane safely at Anchorage. The ash blanketed an area of about 7,700 sq mi (20,000 km2). The 1989 eruption is also notable for being the first ever volcanic eruption to be successfully predicted by the method of long-period seismic events developed by Swiss/American volcanologist Bernard Chouet. As of August 2015, the Alaska Volcano Observatory has rated Redoubt as Aviation Alert Level Green and Volcano Alert Level Normal. Name The official name of the mountain is Redoubt Volcano, a translation of the Russian name \\"Sopka Redutskaya\\", referring to, as does the word \\"redoubt\\", \\"a fortified place\\". A local name, \\"Ujakushatsch\\", also means \\"fortified place\\", but it is difficult to determine if one name is derived from the other. The Board on Geographic Names decided on the name \\"Redoubt Volcano\\" in 1891. The Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian Institution refers to the mountain simply as \\"Redoubt\\", and lists the following as alternate names: Burnt Mountain, Goreloi, Mirando, Ujakushatsch, Viesokaia and Yjakushatsch. The Alaska Volcano Observatory also uses simply \\"Redoubt\\"; it lists the same alternate names in addition to the following: Goryalaya; Redoute Mtn.; and Redutskaya, Sopka. Geology A chunk of andesite thrown from the volcano in 2009 is seen on display at the Anchorage Museum in March 2011. The volcano is about in diameter at its base with a rough volume of . The sides of the upper cone are relatively steep (in comparison to volcanoes in general). Made up of pyroclastic flow deposits and lava flows, and resting on Mesozoic era rocks of the Aleutian Mountain Range batholith, the mountain has been somewhat weathered by movement of several glaciers that reside on it. The current main vent is on the north side of the crater by the head of the Drift glacier. Also present on the mountain are Holocene lahar deposits that extend as far as the Cook Inlet. This mountain has produced andesite, basalt and dacite, with relatively silicic andesite dominant in recent eruptions.Redoubt Volcano, Alaska: Map, Facts and Eruption Pictures Eruptions North face in 1980 =Early reports= Captain James Cook saw Mt. Redoubt during the summer of 1778, describing it as \\"emitting a white smoke but no fire which made some think it was no more than a white thick cloud such as we have frequently seen on the Coast, for the most part appearing on the sides of hills and often extends along a whole range and at different times falls or rises, expands or contracts itself and has a resemblance to Clouds of white smoke. But this besides being too small for one of those clouds, remained as it were fixed in the same spot for the whole time the Mountain was clear which was above 48 hours.\\" However, several sources call this a \\"discredited eruption\\". There are several other of these activities that are not called eruptions. In 1819, smoke was observed at the mountain. However, this is often not recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify it as such. Similarly, in 2003, a blowing cloud of snow was mistaken by an employee of the ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume. Possible steam-vapor let off was observed in 1933 at the mountain. April 21, 1990 eruption cloud (to a height of about 9 km) from Redoubt Volcano as viewed to the west from the Kenai Peninsula Fumaroles observed on the side of Mount Redoubt on January 31, 2009 Fumarole on March 21, 2009, the day before the eruption A plume of vapor from Mt Redoubt as seen from space on 5 May 2009. Redoubt Volcano geologic map =1881= There was apparently an eruption described as \\"to the eastward, Redoubt Volcano, high, is constantly smoking, with periods of exaggerated activity. Fire has been seen issuing from its summit far out at sea. A great eruption took place in 1881, when a party of native hunters half-way up its slopes were overwhelmed by a lava-flow and only two escaped.\\" However, this eruption is not well documented by other sources. =1902= The volcano erupted rather abruptly in 1902, spewing out ash from January 18 to June 21 in the year. A local newspaper stated, \\"Word has just been received that Redoubt, one of the volcanoes at Cook's Inlet had an eruption on January 18, and the country for around was covered with ashes and lava. The news comes from Sunrise, but nothing definite has been ascertained as to whether any damage was done, for no boats have as yet been in the neighborhood of the volcano.\\" There were many other news reports on the eruption, one describing the eruption as \\"a terrific earthquake which burst the mountain asunder leaving a large gap,\\" which could possibly suggest the crack formation in the volcano's crater, however, it is unlikely. Supposedly, the volcano was ejecting \\"flames\\" from its crater, and the eruption terrified natives in the area. Newspapers seemed to suggest that the ash had traveled for more than , reaching the opposite side of the Cook Inlet. =1989‚Äì1990= The volcano erupted on December 14, 1989, and continued to erupt for over six months. Sudden melting of snow and ice at the summit caused by pyroclastic flows and dome collapses caused lahars, or mudflows, which flowed down the north flank of the mountain. A majority of the mudflows coursed to Cook Inlet, about from the volcano. The lahars entered a nearby river, worrying officials that they might destroy an oil storage facility located along it. Since lahars were produced repeatedly, scientists realized that they could use these to analyze a trial period for a newly developed device proposed to measure the movement of rocks against each other. This device, now known as an Acoustic Flow Monitor, alerts nearby stations to possible lahars. The eruption also caused an airliner to have all four engines fail after a Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet operated by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flew into a cloud of volcanic ash. Damage from the eruption was estimated at $160 million, the second costliest volcanic eruption in United States history.(Subscription) =2009=  Pre-eruption  On January 24, 2009, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake hit the region at a depth of 98 kilometers. The relation to the eruption is unknown, but was the strongest in the vicinity since 2001. On January 30, 2009, scientists from the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) warned that an eruption was imminent, sending experienced Alaskans shopping for protection against a dusty shower of volcanic ash that could descend on south-central Alaska. By January 31, volcanic earthquakes increased to several per hour, and a large hole in the glacier on the side of the mountain was spotted. Scientists began to monitor seismic data from the mountain twenty-four hours a day in an effort to warn people in nearby communities. A fly over conducted by the AVO detected \\"significant steaming from a new melt depression at the mouth of the summit crater near the vent area of the 1989-90 eruption.\\"  March 15 Seismic activity at Redoubt increased beginning about 13:01 ATZ. An AVO observation flight reported that a steam and ash plume rose as high as above sea level and produced minor ash fall on the upper south flank of Redoubt.

The aim of this technique is to quickly and efficiently compare two genomic DNA samples arising from two sources, which are most often closely related, because it is suspected that they contain differences in terms of either gains or losses of either whole chromosomes or subchromosomal regions (a portion of a whole chromosome). This technique was originally developed for the evaluation of the differences between the chromosomal complements of solid tumor and normal tissue, and has an improved resolution of 5‚Äì10 megabases compared to the more traditional cytogenetic analysis techniques of giemsa banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) which are limited by the resolution of the microscope utilized.Strachan T, Read AP (2010) Human Molecular Genetics: Garland Science.Weiss M, Hermsen M, Meijer G, Van Grieken N, Baak J, Kuipers E, Van Diest P (1999) Comparative genomic hybridization. Molecular Pathology 52:243‚Äì251. This is achieved through the use of competitive fluorescence in situ hybridization. In short, this involves the isolation of DNA from the two sources to be compared, most commonly a test and reference source, independent labelling of each DNA sample with fluorophores (fluorescent molecules) of different colours (usually red and green), denaturation of the DNA so that it is single stranded, and the hybridization of the two resultant samples in a 1:1 ratio to a normal metaphase spread of chromosomes, to which the labelled DNA samples will bind at their locus of origin. Using a fluorescence microscope and computer software, the differentially coloured fluorescent signals are then compared along the length of each chromosome for identification of chromosomal differences between the two sources. A higher intensity of the test sample colour in a specific region of a chromosome indicates the gain of material of that region in the corresponding source sample, while a higher intensity of the reference sample colour indicates the loss of material in the test sample in that specific region. A neutral colour (yellow when the fluorophore labels are red and green) indicates no difference between the two samples in that location. CGH is only able to detect unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities. This is because balanced chromosomal abnormalities such as reciprocal translocations, inversions or ring chromosomes do not affect copy number, which is what is detected by CGH technologies. CGH does, however, allow for the exploration of all 46 human chromosomes in single test and the discovery of deletions and duplications, even on the microscopic scale which may lead to the identification of candidate genes to be further explored by other cytological techniques. Through the use of DNA microarrays in conjunction with CGH techniques, the more specific form of array CGH (aCGH) has been developed, allowing for a locus-by-locus measure of CNV with increased resolution as low as 100 kilobases.Pinkel D, Albertson DG (2005) Comparative genomic hybridization. Annu Rev Genom Hum Genet 6:331‚Äì354.de Ravel TJ, Devriendt K, Fryns J-P, Vermeesch JR (2007) What's new in karyotyping? The move towards array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). European Journal of Pediatrics 166:637‚Äì643. This improved technique allows for the aetiology of known and unknown conditions to be discovered. History The motivation underlying the development of CGH stemmed from the fact that the available forms of cytogenetic analysis at the time (giemsa banding and FISH) were limited in their potential resolution by the microscopes necessary for interpretation of the results they provided. Furthermore, giemsa banding interpretation has the potential to be ambiguous and therefore has lowered reliability, and both techniques require high labour inputs which limits the loci which may be examined. The first report of CGH analysis was by Kallioniemi and colleagues in 1992 at the University of California, San Francisco, who utilised CGH in the analysis of solid tumors. They achieved this by the direct application of the technique to both breast cancer cell lines and primary bladder tumors in order to establish complete copy number karyotypes for the cells. They were able to identify 16 different regions of amplification, many of which were novel discoveries. Soon after in 1993, du Manoir et al. reported virtually the same methodology. The authors painted a series of individual human chromosomes from a DNA library with two different fluorophores in different proportions to test the technique, and also applied CGH to genomic DNA from patients affected with either Downs syndrome or T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia as well as cells of a renal papillary carcinoma cell line. It was concluded that the fluorescence ratios obtained were accurate and that differences between genomic DNA from different cell types were detectable, and therefore that CGH was a highly useful cytogenetic analysis tool. Initially, the widespread use of CGH technology was difficult, as protocols were not uniform and therefore inconsistencies arose, especially due to uncertainties in the interpretation of data. However, in 1994 a review was published which described an easily understood protocol in detailKallioniemi OP, Kallioniemi A, Piper J, Isola J, Waldman FM, Gray JW, Pinkel D (1994) Optimizing comparative genomic hybridization for analysis of DNA sequence copy number changes in solid tumors. Genes, Chromosomes and Cancer 10:231‚Äì243. and the image analysis software was made available commercially, which allowed CGH to be utilised all around the world. As new techniques such as microdissection and degenerate oligonucleotide primed polymerase chain reaction (DOP-PCR) became available for the generation of DNA products, it was possible to apply the concept of CGH to smaller chromosomal abnormalities, and thus the resolution of CGH was improved. The implementation of array CGH, whereby DNA microarrays are used instead of the traditional metaphase chromosome preparation, was pioneered by Solinas-Tolodo et al. in 1997 using tumor cellsSolinas-Toldo S, Lampel S, Stilgenbauer S, Nickolenko J, Benner A, D√∂hner H, Cremer T, Lichter P (1997) Matrix-based comparative genomic hybridization: biochips to screen for genomic imbalances. Genes, Chromosomes and Cancer 20:399‚Äì407. and Pinkel et al. in 1998 by use of breast cancer cells.Pinkel D, Segraves R, Sudar D, Clark S, Poole I, Kowbel D, Collins C, Kuo W-L, Chen C, Zhai Y (1998) High resolution analysis of DNA copy number variation using comparative genomic hybridization to microarrays. Nature genetics 20:207‚Äì211. This was made possible by the Human Genome Project which generated a library of cloned DNA fragments with known locations throughout the human genome, with these fragments being used as probes on the DNA microarray.Marquis-Nicholson R, Aftimos S, Hayes I, George A, Love DR (2010) Array comparative genomic hybridization: a new tool in the diagnostic genetic armoury. NZ Med J 123:50‚Äì61. Now probes of various origins such as cDNA, genomic PCR products and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) can be used on DNA microarrays which may contain up to 2 million probes. Array CGH is automated, allows greater resolution (down to 100 kb) than traditional CGH as the probes are far smaller than metaphase preparations, requires smaller amounts of DNA, can be targeted to specific chromosomal regions if required and is ordered and therefore faster to analyse, making it far more adaptable to diagnostic uses. Figure 1. Schematic of CGH protocol Basic methods =Metaphase slide preparation= The DNA on the slide is a reference sample, and is thus obtained from a karyotypically normal man or woman, though it is preferential to use female DNA as they possess two X chromosomes which contain far more genetic information than the male Y chromosome. Phytohaemagglutinin stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes are used. 1mL of heparinised blood is added to 10ml of culture medium and incubated for 72 hours at 37 ¬∞C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Colchicine is added to arrest the cells in mitosis, the cells are then harvested and treated with hypotonic potassium chloride and fixed in 3:1 methanol/acetic acid. One drop of the cell suspension should then be dropped onto an ethanol cleaned slide from a distance of about 30 cm, optimally this should be carried out at room temperature at humidity levels of 60‚Äì70%. Slides should be evaluated by visualisation using a phase contrast microscope, minimal cytoplasm should be observed and chromosomes should not be overlapping and be 400‚Äì550 bands long with no separated chromatids and finally should appear dark rather than shiny. Slides then need to be air dried overnight at room temperature, and any further storage should be in groups of four at ‚àí20 ¬∞C with either silica beads or nitrogen present to maintain dryness. Different donors should be tested as hybridization may be variable. Commercially available slides may be used, but should always be tested first. =Isolation of DNA from test tissue and reference tissue= Standard phenol extraction is used to obtain DNA from test or reference (karyotypically normal individual) tissue, which involves the combination of Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and phenol with aqueous DNA in equal amounts. This is followed by separation by agitation and centrifugation, after which the aqueous layer is removed and further treated using ether and finally ethanol precipitation is used to concentrate the DNA. May be completed using DNA isolation kits available commercially which are based on affinity columns. Preferentially, DNA should be extracted from fresh or frozen tissue as this will be of the highest quality, though it is now possible to use archival material which is formalin fixed or paraffin wax embedded, provided the appropriate procedures are followed. 0.5-1 Œºg of DNA is sufficient for the CGH experiment, though if the desired amount is not obtained DOP-PCR may be applied to amplify the DNA, however it in this case it is important to apply DOP-PCR to both the test and reference DNA samples to improve reliability. =DNA labelling= Nick translation is used to label the DNA and involves cutting DNA and substituting nucleotides labelled with fluorophores (direct labelling) or biotin or oxigenin to have fluophore conjugated antibodies added later (indirect labelling). It is then important to check fragment lengths of both test and reference DNA by gel electrophoresis, as they should be within the range of 500kb-1500kb for optimum hybridization. =Blocking= Unlabelled Life Technologies Corporation's Cot-1 DNA (placental DNA enriched with repetitive sequences of length 50bp-100bp)is added to block normal repetitive DNA sequences, particularly at centromeres and telomeres, as these sequences, if detected, may reduce the fluorescence ratio and cause gains or losses to escape detection. =Hybridization= 8‚Äì12Œºl of each of labelled test and labelled reference DNA are mixed and 40 Œºg Cot-1 DNA is added, then precipitated and subsequently dissolved in 6Œºl of hybridization mix, which contains 50% formamide to decrease DNA melting temperature and 10% dextran sulphate to increase the effective probe concentration in a saline sodium citrate (SSC) solution at a pH of 7.0. Denaturation of the slide and probes are carried out separately. The slide is submerged in 70% formamide/2xSSC for 5‚Äì10 minutes at 72 ¬∞C, while the probes are denatured by immersion in a water bath of 80 ¬∞C for 10 minutes and are immediately added to the metaphase slide preparation. This reaction is then covered with a coverslip and left for two to four days in a humid chamber at 40 ¬∞C. The coverslip is then removed and 5 minute washes are applied, three using 2xSSC at room temperature, one at 45 ¬∞C with 0.1xSSC and one using TNT at room temperature. The reaction is then preincubated for 10 minutes then followed by a 60-minute, 37 ¬∞C incubation, three more 5 minute washes with TNT then one with 2xSSC at room temperature. The slide is then dried using an ethanol series of 70%/96%/100% before counterstaining with DAPI (0.35 Œºg/ml), for chromosome identification, and sealing with a coverslip. =Fluorescence visualisation and imaging= A fluorescence microscope with the appropriate filters for the DAPI stain as well as the two fluorophores utilised is required for visualisation, and these filters should also minimise the crosstalk between the fluorophores, such as narrow band pass filters. The microscope must provide uniform illumination without chromatic variation, be appropriately aligned and have a \\"plan\\" type of objective which is apochromatic and give a magnification of x63 or x100. The image should be recorded using a camera with spatial resolution at least 0.1 Œºm at the specimen level and give an image of at least 600x600 pixels. The camera must also be able to integrate the image for at least 5 to 10 seconds, with a minimum photometric resolution of 8 bit. Dedicated CGH software is commercially available for the image processing step, and is required to subtract background noise, remove and segment materials not of chromosomal origin, normalize the fluorescence ratio, carry out interactive karyotyping and chromosome scaling to standard length. A \\"relative copy number karyotype\\" which presents chromosomal areas of deletions or amplifications is generated by averaging the ratios of a number of high quality metaphases and plotting them along an ideogram, a diagram identifying chromosomes based on banding patterns. Interpretation of the ratio profiles is conducted either using fixed or statistical thresholds (confidence intervals). When using confidence intervals, gains or losses are identified when 95% of the fluorescence ratio does not contain 1.0. = Extra notes = Extreme care must be taken to avoid contamination of any step involving DNA, especially with the test DNA as contamination of the sample with normal DNA will skew results closer to 1.0, thus abnormalities may go undetected. FISH, PCR and flow cytometry experiments may be employed to confirm results.Evangelidou P, Alexandrou A, Moutafi M, Ioannides M, Antoniou P, Koumbaris G, Kallikas I, Velissariou V, Sismani C, Patsalis PC (2013) Implementation of High Resolution Whole Genome Array CGH in the Prenatal Clinical Setting: Advantages, Challenges, and Review of the Literature. BioMed Research International 2013. Array comparative genomic hybridization Array comparative genomic hybridization (also microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization, matrix CGH, array CGH, aCGH) is a molecular cytogenetic technique for the detection of chromosomal copy number changes on a genome wide and high-resolution scale. Array CGH compares the patient's genome against a reference genome and identifies differences between the two genomes, and hence locates regions of genomic imbalances in the patient, utilizing the same principles of competitive fluorescence in situ hybridization as traditional CGH. With the introduction of array CGH, the main limitation of conventional CGH, a low resolution, is overcome. In array CGH, the metaphase chromosomes are replaced by cloned DNA fragments (+100‚Äì200 kb) of which the exact chromosomal location is known. This allows the detection of aberrations in more detail and, moreover, makes it possible to map the changes directly onto the genomic sequence.Oostlander AE, Meijer GA, Ylstra B (2004) Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization and its applications in human genetics. Clin Genet 66:488‚Äì495. Array CGH has proven to be a specific, sensitive, fast and highthroughput technique, with considerable advantages compared to other methods used for the analysis of DNA copy number changes making it more amenable to diagnostic applications. Using this method, copy number changes at a level of 5‚Äì10 kilobases of DNA sequences can be detected. , even high-resolution CGH (HR-CGH) arrays are accurate to detect structural variations (SV) at resolution of 200 bp. This method allows one to identify new recurrent chromosome changes such as microdeletions and duplications in human conditions such as cancer and birth defects due to chromosome aberrations. Figure 2. Array-CGH protocol =Methodology= Array CGH is based on the same principle as conventional CGH. In both techniques, DNA from a reference (or control) sample and DNA from a test (or patient) sample are differentially labelled with two different fluorophores and used as probes that are cohybridized competitively onto nucleic acid targets. In conventional CGH, the target is a reference metaphase spread. In array CGH, these targets can be genomic fragments cloned in a variety of vectors (such as BACs or plasmids), cDNAs, or oligonucleotides.Bejjani BA, Shaffer LG (2006) Applications of array-based comparative genomic hybridization to clinical diagnostics. J Mol Diagn 8:528‚Äì533. Figure 2. is a schematic overview of the array CGH technique. DNA from the sample to be tested is labeled with a red fluorophore (Cyanine 5) and a reference DNA sample is labeled with green fluorophore (Cyanine 3). Equal quantities of the two DNA samples are mixed and cohybridized to a DNA microarray of several thousand evenly spaced cloned DNA fragments or oligonucleotides, which have been spotted in triplicate on the array. After hybridization, digital imaging systems are used to capture and quantify the relative fluorescence intensities of each of the hybridized fluorophores. The resulting ratio of the fluorescence intensities is proportional to the ratio of the copy numbers of DNA sequences in the test and reference genomes. If the intensities of the flurochromes are equal on one probe, this region of the patient's genome is interpreted as having equal quantity of DNA in the test and reference samples; if there is an altered Cy3:Cy5 ratio this indicates a loss or a gain of the patient DNA at that specific genomic region.Shinawi M, Cheung SW (2008) The array CGH and its clinical applications. Drug Discovery Today 13:760‚Äì769. =Technological approaches to array CGH= ACGH profile of the IMR32 neuroblastoma cell line Array CGH has been implemented using a wide variety of techniques. Therefore, some of the advantages and limitations of array CGH are dependent on the technique chosen. The initial approaches used arrays produced from large insert genomic DNA clones, such as BACs. The use of BACs provides sufficient intense signals to detect single-copy changes and to locate aberration boundaries accurately. However, initial DNA yields of isolated BAC clones are low and DNA amplification techniques are necessary. These techniques include ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR), degenerate primer PCR using one or several sets of primers, and rolling circle amplification. Arrays can also be constructed using cDNA. These arrays currently yield a high spatial resolution, but the number of cDNAs is limited by the genes that are encoded on the chromosomes, and their sensitivity is low due to cross-hybridization. This results in the inability to detect single copy changes on a genome wide scale. The latest approach is spotting the arrays with short oligonucleotides. The amount of oligos is almost infinite, and the processing is rapid, cost- effective, and easy. Although oligonucleotides do not have the sensitivity to detect single copy changes, averaging of ratios from oligos that map next to each other on the chromosome can compensate for the reduced sensitivity. It is also possible to use arrays which have overlapping probes so that specific breakpoints may be uncovered. =Design approaches= There are two approaches to the design of microarrays for CGH applications: whole genome and targeted. Whole genome arrays are designed to cover the entire human genome. They often include clones that provide an extensive coverage across the genome; and arrays that have contiguous coverage, within the limits of the genome. Whole- genome arrays have been constructed mostly for research applications and have proven their outstanding worth in gene discovery. They are also very valuable in screening the genome for DNA gains and losses at an unprecedented resolution. Targeted arrays are designed for a specific region(s) of the genome for the purpose of evaluating that targeted segment. It may be designed to study a specific chromosome or chromosomal segment or to identify and evaluate specific DNA dosage abnormalities in individuals with suspected microdeletion syndromes or subtelomeric rearrangements. The crucial goal of a targeted microarray in medical practice is to provide clinically useful results for diagnosis, genetic counseling, prognosis, and clinical management of unbalanced cytogenetic abnormalities. Applications =Conventional= Conventional CGH has been used mainly for the identification of chromosomal regions that are recurrently lost or gained in tumors, as well as for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.Weiss MM, Kuipers EJ, Meuwissen SG, van Diest PJ, Meijer GA (2003) Comparative genomic hybridization as a supportive tool in diagnostic pathology. J Clin Pathol 56:522‚Äì527. This approach can also be used to study chromosomal aberrations in fetal and neonatal genomes. Furthermore, conventional CGH can be used in detecting chromosomal abnormalities and have been shown to be efficient in diagnosing complex abnormalities associated with human genetic disorders. In cancer research CGH data from several studies of the same tumor type show consistent patterns of non-random genetic aberrations. Some of these changes appear to be common to various kinds of malignant tumors, while others are more tumor specific. For example, gains of chromosomal regions lq, 3q and 8q, as well as losses of 8p, 13q, 16q and 17p, are common to a number of tumor types, such as breast, ovarian, prostate, renal and bladder cancer (Figure. 3). Other alterations, such as 12p and Xp gains in testicular cancer, 13q gain 9q loss in bladder cancer, 14q loss in renal cancer and Xp loss in ovarian cancer are more specific, and might reflect the unique selection forces operating during cancer development in different organs. Array CGH is also frequently used in research and diagnostics of B cell malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Chromosomal aberrations Cri du Chat (CdC) is a syndrome caused by a partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5. Several studies have shown that conventional CGH is suitable to detect the deletion, as well as more complex chromosomal alterations. For example, Levy et al. (2002) reported an infant with a cat-like cry, the hallmark of CdC, but having an indistinct karyotype. CGH analysis revealed a loss of chromosomal material from 5p15.3 confirming the diagnosis clinically. These results demonstrate that conventional CGH is a reliable technique in detecting structural aberrations and, in specific cases, may be more efficient in diagnosing complex abnormalities. =Array CGH= Array CGH applications are mainly directed at detecting genomic abnormalities in cancer. However, array CGH is also suitable for the analysis of DNA copy number aberrations that cause human genetic disorders. That is, array CGH is employed to uncover deletions, amplifications, breakpoints and ploidy abnormalities. Earlier diagnosis is of benefit to the patient as they may undergo appropriate treatments and counseling to improve their prognosis. Genomic abnormalities in cancer Genetic alterations and rearrangements occur frequently in cancer and contribute to its pathogenesis. Detecting these aberrations by array CGH provides information on the locations of important cancer genes and can have clinical use in diagnosis, cancer classification and prognostification. However, not all of the losses of genetic material are pathogenetic, since some DNA material is physiologically lost during the rearrangement of immunoglobulin subgenes. In a recent study, array CGH has been implemented to identify regions of chromosomal aberration (copy-number variation) in several mouse models of breast cancer, leading to identification of cooperating genes during myc-induced oncogenesis. Array CGH may also be applied not only to the discovery of chromosomal abnormalities in cancer, but also to the monitoring of the progression of tumors. Differentiation between metastatic and mild lesions is also possible using FISH once the abnormalities have been identified by array CGH. Submicroscopic aberrations Prader‚ÄìWilli syndrome (PWS) is a paternal structural abnormality involving 15q11-13, while a maternal aberration in the same region causes Angelman syndrome (AS). In both syndromes, the majority of cases (75%) are the result of a 3‚Äì5 Mb deletion of the PWS/AS critical region.L'Hermine AC, Aboura A, Brisset S, Cuisset L, Castaigne V, Labrune P, Frydman R, Tachdjian G. (2003) Fetal phenotype of Prader‚ÄìWilli syndrome due to maternal disomy for chromosome 15. Prenat Diagn 23:938‚Äì943. These small aberrations cannot be detected using cytogenetics or conventional CGH, but can be readily detected using array CGH. As a proof of principle Vissers et al. (2003) constructed a genome wide array with a 1 Mb resolution to screen three patients with known, FISH-confirmed microdeletion syndromes, including one with PWS. In all three cases, the abnormalities, ranging from 1.5 to 2.9Mb, were readily identified. Thus, array CGH was demonstrated to be a specific and sensitive approach in detecting submicroscopic aberrations. When using overlapping microarrays, it is also possible to uncover breakpoints involved in chromosomal aberrations. Prenatal genetic diagnosis Though not yet a widely employed technique, the use of array CGH as a tool for preimplantation genetic screening is becoming an increasingly popular concept. It has the potential to detect CNVs and aneuploidy in eggs, sperm or embryos which may contribute to failure of the embryo to successfully implant, miscarriage or conditions such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21). This makes array CGH a promising tool to reduce the incidence of life altering conditions and improve success rates of IVF attempts. The technique involves whole genome amplification from a single cell which is then used in the array CGH method. It may also be used in couples carrying chromosomal translocations such as balanced reciprocal translocations or Robertsonian translocations, which have the potential to cause chromosomal imbalances in their offspring. Limitations of CGH and array CGH A main disadvantage of conventional CGH is its inability to detect structural chromosomal aberrations without copy number changes, such as mosaicism, balanced chromosomal translocations, and inversions. CGH can also only detect gains and losses relative to the ploidy level.Weiss MM, Hermsen MAJA, Meijer GA, van Grieken NCT, Baak JPA, Kuipers EJ, van Deist PJ (1999) Comparative genomic hybridization. J Clin Pathol: Mol Pathol 52:243‚Äì251. In addition, chromosomal regions with short repetitive DNA sequences are highly variable between individuals and can interfere with CGH analysis. Therefore, repetitive DNA regions like centromeres and telomeres need to be blocked with unlabeled repetitive DNA (e.g. Cot1 DNA) and/or can be omitted from screening.du Manoir S, Schrock E, Bentz M, Speicher MR, Joos S, Ried T, Lichter P, Cremer T (1995) Quantitative analysis of comparative genomic hybridization. Cytometry 19:27‚Äì41. Furthermore, the resolution of conventional CGH is a major practical problem that limits its clinical applications. Although CGH has proven to be a useful and reliable technique in the research and diagnostics of both cancer and human genetic disorders, the applications involve only gross abnormalities. Because of the limited resolution of metaphase chromosomes, aberrations smaller than 5‚Äì10 Mb cannot be detected using conventional CGH. For the detection of such abnormalities, a high-resolution technique is required. Array CGH overcomes many of these limitations. Array CGH is characterized by a high resolution, its major advantage with respect to conventional CGH. The standard resolution varies between 1 and 5 Mb, but can be increased up to approximately 40 kb by supplementing the array with extra clones. However, as in conventional CGH, the main disadvantage of array CGH is its inability to detect aberrations that do not result in copy number changes and is limited in its ability to detect mosaicism. The level of mosaicism that can be detected is dependent on the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the clones. At present, rearrangements present in approximately 50% of the cells is the detection limit. For the detection of such abnormalities, other techniques, such as SKY (Spectral karyotyping) or FISH have to still be used.

Her maternal grandparents, Adolph and Rosa Kronberg (n√©e Appelbaum), were Jewish immigrants. Adolph immigrated to Chicago from Romania and Rosa came from Hungary. In December 1942, aged 22, while working as a student nurse at Cook County Hospital, she met Cheddi Jagan, an Indo-Guyanese dentistry student at Northwestern University. They married on August 5, 1943, and in December that year she moved with him to Guyana, where he set up his dental practice.  In Guyana  In Guyana, she took part in labor activism along with her husband and joined the British Guianese Labor Union. She also worked in her husband's dental clinic as a nurse for 10 years. In 1946, she founded the Women's Political and Economic Organization and co- founded the Political Affairs Committee. Political career Janet Jagan unsuccessfully ran for a seat from Central Georgetown in the 1947 general election. On January 1, 1950,History of the PPP, PPP website. she and her husband were co-founders of the left-wing People's Progressive Party (PPP); Janet served as the PPP's General Secretary from 1950 to 1970. Also in 1950, Jagan was elected to the Georgetown City Council. She was subsequently elected to the House of Assembly in the April 1953 election,\\"The General Election of 1953\\", Guyana.org. winning a seat from Essequibo constituency. She was one of three women to win seats in that election; following the election, she was chosen as Deputy Speaker of the Legislature. Janet Jagan Presidential Standard The PPP, a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist party, opposed British colonial rule of Guyana. After its electoral victory in April 1953, the PPP briefly formed the government, but the British government had the PPP government removed later in the year due to concerns about the Jagans' alleged Communist sympathies. Leading the country for only 133 days in 1953 following the free and universal election, she and Cheddi were first deposed and then jailed in 1955 on orders of Winston Churchill who feared the existence of a Communist country in the Western hemisphere. Churchill wished to prevent the potential for Russia to form ties with the new government, though this never occurred. Cheddi and Janet remained in jail for five months; they were subsequently kept under house arrest for two years. Winston Churchill had modified the Guyanese constitution to prevent her and Cheddi from holding the office of President or Prime Minister. In 1957, she was re-elected to the House of Assembly from Essequibo constituency and became Minister of Labour, Health and Housing. Retaining his popularity, in 1961, Cheddi was re-elected Prime Minister.

As of 2010, the ward has an estimated population of 163,406 and a population density of 8,520 persons per km¬≤. The total area is 19.17 km¬≤. Geography Isogo is located in eastern Kanagawa Prefecture, and in the southeast corner of the city of Yokohama. The area is largely flatland, with scattered small hills. The Ward is bordered to the east by Tokyo Bay. =Surrounding municipalities= *Naka Ward *Minami Ward *Kanazawa Ward *Sakae Ward *K≈çnan-ku History During the Edo period, area around present-day Isogo Ward was formerly part of the tenry≈ç territory in Sagami Province controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, but administered through various hatamoto. The area consisted of small fishing villages, noted primarily for their catch of Sea cucumber. After the Meiji Restoration, the area became part of Kuraki District in the new Kanagawa Prefecture. In the cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, the area was divided into numerous villages. On April 1, 1901, Negishi village was annexed by neighboring Yokohama. The remaining northern portions of the district were annexed in 1911 and 1927. On October 10, 1927, the 14 former towns and villages were re- organized as Isogo Ward within the city of Yokohama. Isogo Ward annexed the remaining southern portions of Kuraki District (Kanazawa Town and Mutsuuraso Village) in October 1936. During World War II, Isogo was bombed twice: once on April 15, 1945, and again during the devastating Yokohama Air Raid of May 29, 1945, during which 692 houses were burned down. On May 15, 1948, Kanazawa Ward was separated from Isogo Ward. During the 1960s, the coastal areas of Isogo were converted into a massive chemical and petrochemical industrial zone through the extensive use of landfill, and the population of the area increased dramatically. The Isogo Ward offices relocated to their present location in June 1967. Economy Isogo is largely a regional commercial center and bedroom community for central Yokohama, Kawasaki and Tokyo. The coastal area is part of the Keihin heavy industrial zone, and has numerous chemical and petrochemical plants.

The book won a Newbery Honor award in 2003. Plot The main character Roy Eberhardt moves from Montana to Florida and into the fictional town of Coconut Cove, where a 7th grader, Dana Matherson, starts to bully him. On the bus to school, Roy sees a boy running barefoot outside. Roy tries to leave the bus, but Dana viciously chokes and strangles him. He escapes after punching Dana in the face, breaking his nose, and then exiting the bus. But Roy can't catch the running boy because a golf ball hits Roy in the head. Vice-Principal Viola Hennepin suspends him from the bus for two weeks and orders Roy to write an apology to Dana. Roy calls for a truce, but Dana refuses to accept. A restaurant called Mother Paula's All- American Pancake House decides to build a franchise in Coconut Cove, but vandalism delays the work. Roy learns the running boy is the vandal known as \\"Mullet Fingers\\" and they become friends. Mullet Fingers vandalizes and delays construction overseen by Chuck Muckle to save the endangered burrowing owls that live on the site. The construction foreman Leroy \\"Curly\\" Branitt denies the owls' existence. Roy helps Mullet Fingers prove otherwise and tells his class including Beatrice Leep about the owls, how construction will kill the endangered species, and encourages them to join him in protests. Roy and his classmates attend the groundbreaking and expose the truth. This includes the company's illegal removal of an environmental impact statement from their files. This revelation saves the owls and their habitat. Mother Paula's All- American Pancake House blames former employees and promises to preserve the property as an owl sanctuary. Muckle is sent to anger management for attacking a reporter. Dana is later arrested and sentenced to a detention camp. Mullet Fingers's mother sees him protesting with Roy and his classmates and goes in front of all the cameras and attempts to hog all the attention. Two days later, Mullet Fingers climbs out his home's bathroom window and is mistaken for a burglar. Mullet Fingers's mother lies to the police and says he stole a very valuable toe ring. They believe her and he's sent to a juvenile detention center where he escapes. In the last chapter, Roy discovers that Mullet Fingers's real name is Napoleon Bridger Leep.

Publication history Carl Hiaasen started writing children's books when he realized that the other novels that he had written were too adult for his nieces and nephews. In writing his first young adult novel, Hiaasen faced some challenges: \\"The biggest challenge was trying not to subconsciously 'write down' for young readers.\\" Hiaasen said, \\"When I was creating the character in Hoot, I'm sure I stole liberally from my pre-adolescence.\\" Themes The themes in the novel are friendship, teamwork, growing up, corruption, parental love, kinship, environmentalism and integrity. The character goes through different adventures to get here. Critical reception Horn Book Magazine Reviews said, ‚ÄúHoot is quintessential Hiaasen ‚Ä¶ peopled with original and wacky characters‚Ä¶ Not consistently a hoot, but worthy of a holler. Hiaasen's first YA book succeeds as a humorous diversion.‚Äù Publishers Weekly claims that \\"With a Florida setting and pro-environment, anti-development message, Hiaasen returns to familiar turf for his first novel for young readers‚Ä¶ Several suspenseful scenes, along with dollops of humor, help make this quite a hoot indeed.\\"Riverside Public Library, Reviews Adaptations A film adaptation of the book was released in May 2006, starring Luke Wilson as Officer Delinko, Logan Lerman as Roy Eberhart, Brie Larson as Beatrice Leep, Tim Blake Nelson as Leroy Brannit, Neil Flynn as Mr. Eberhart, Robert Wagner as Mayor Grandy, Cody Linley as Napoleon Leep, and Clark Gregg as Chuck Muckle while Hiaasen portrays Muckle's assistant Felix.

They were built with four Type 96 anti-aircraft guns in two twin-gun mounts, but more of these guns were added over the course of the war. The ships were also armed with eight torpedo tubes for the oxygen-fueled Type 93 \\"Long Lance\\" torpedo in two quadruple traversing mounts; one reload was carried for each tube. Their anti-submarine weapons consisted of 16 depth charges. Construction and career =Imperial Japanese Navy= During the Pacific War, the attrition rate of Japanese destroyers was extremely high due to heavy, prolonged combat and the need to use them to transport supplies to scattered Japanese island garrisons. Early in the war, Yukikaze took part in the invasions of the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies. She participated in the battles of Midway, Santa Cruz, Leyte Gulf, and the Philippine Sea, as well as a lengthy stint on Guadalcanal troop runs and the naval battles around that island. Yukikaze also survived Operation Ten-Go, during which the battleship was sunk. Between these major engagements, Yukikaze participated in escort duty for ships in transit, particularly in the redeployment of the aircraft carrier during which the newly completed carrier was torpedoed by a U.S. Navy submarine and sunk. She spent the last months of the war on security duty in Japanese harbors and survived many Allied air raids. As a result of participating in and surviving some of the most dangerous battles the IJN had fought, Yukikaze is very popular in Japan, being called \\"the unsinkable ship\\" and \\"the miracle ship\\" much like prior to that ship's sinking by . Yukikaze took part in more than 10 major battles, and more than 100 escort missions and resupply transport missions during World War II. After the war, she was used as a transport to bring home Japanese military forces still abroad. Yukikaze, ' and were the only ships to survive among the 82 Japanese destroyers built before the war. =ROCS Tan Yang= Off Rabaul, c. 1943 On 6 July 1947, Yukikaze was transferred to the Republic of China as a war reparation, where she was renamed Tan Yang (‰∏πÈôΩ). All destroyers were named after Yang regardless of country of origin. Tan Yang served as flagship of the Republic of China Navy, and between 1947 and 1953 was fitted with Type 89 12.7 cm/40 dual mounted guns, in addition to the Type 98 10cm/65 dual mounted guns already in use. In 1953, Tan Yang was refitted; all Japanese armaments were removed and replaced with three open air mounted 5\\"/38 caliber guns, 3\\"/50 caliber guns replaced the torpedo tubes, Bofors 40 mm guns, and newer depth charge launchers. The Republic of China Navy had no use for the original torpedo tubes as they did not have access to the appropriate armaments. She is notable for visiting Manila where 50,000 overseas Chinese visited her. Tan Yangs service included patrolling the South China Sea and intercepting incoming ships carrying wartime materials into Shanghai. She also intercepted a Polish oil tanker (SS Praca), Prezydent Gottwald, and Soviet Tuapse carrying jet fuel into China between 1953 and 1954, and saw action along the Taiwan Strait in a supporting role as it was one of the few ships with long range guns. However, the arrival of surplus US destroyers entering service put the famous destroyer that once served as flagship into retirement, and she was scrapped in 1970 after being damaged beyond repair in a typhoon in 1969. In Japan, there was a campaign to have her returned to Japan from Taiwan for preservation as a museum ship since she was the symbol for longevity. Her rudder and one of her anchors were repatriated to the Japan Navy Academy museum as a good will gesture.

Early life and military career Tolbukhin was born into a peasant family in the province of Yaroslavl, north-east of Moscow. He volunteered for the Imperial Army in 1914 at the outbreak of World War I. He was steadily promoted, advancing from private to captain by 1916. He was also decorated for bravery multiple times. In August 1918 Tolbukhin joined the Red Army, where he served as the chief of staff of the 56th infantry division. After the Russian Civil War ended (1921), Tolbukhin was given a number of staff positions. He also attended the Frunze Military Academy for advanced staff training, graduating in 1931. In 1937, after a series of staff positions, Tolbukhin was given command of a division. In 1938, he was made chief of staff of the Transcaucasus Military District. World War II Tolbukhin in 1944 Tolbukhin remained in this position through the opening phases of Operation Barbarossa until August 1941, when he was made the chief of staff of the Crimean Front, which he held until March 1942. From May to July 1942, he was the assistant commander of the Stalingrad Military District. After that, he was the commander of the 58th Army until March 1943. The 58th was involved in the Battle of Stalingrad, where Tolbukhin's superior, Colonel- General Andrei Yeremenko, praised his command organization and military prowess. After his command of the 57th, Tolbukhin was placed in command of the Southern Front. Bulgarian First Army, Autumn 1944 In October 1943 the Southern Front was renamed 4th Ukrainian Front. Tolbukhin assisted Rodion Malinovsky's 3rd Ukrainian Front in the Lower Dnieper Offensive and Dnieper- Carpathian Offensive. In May 1944, Tolbukhin was transferred to control of 3rd Ukrainian Front. During the Summer Campaign, from June to October 1944, Tolbukhin and Malinovsky launched their invasion of the Balkans and were able to conquer most of Romania. On September 12, 1944, two days after Malinovsky was promoted to Marshal of the Soviet Union, Tolbukhin was promoted to the same rank. While Malinovsky moved northwest, towards Hungary and Yugoslavia, Tolbukhin occupied Bulgaria. Starting in the Winter Campaign, Tolbukhin shifted his army to the northwest axis, thereby liberating much of Yugoslavia and invading southern Hungary. In late April 1945, at the end of the battle of Vienna, Tolbukhin acted on Stalin's order to entrust Karl Renner with foundation of a new provisional Austrian government in order to prepare democratic elections. On 27 April, Renner was appointed provisional government leader, at Tolbukhin's authority, which renders the latter an important role in the foundation of a new Austrian republic that had been integrated into the Third Reich (1938-1945). Tolbukhin gave the go-ahead at the location, for this important step towards an independent Austria in the formation of the Second Republic (1945-present). Marshal Tolbukhin at a military parade, 1949 After the war, Tolbukhin was commander-in-chief of the Southern Group of Forces, which comprised the Balkan region. In January 1947, Tolbukhin was made the commander of the Transcaucasus Military District, a post he held until his death on October 17, 1949. Tolbukhin is generally regarded as one of the finest Soviet generals of World War II. Meticulous, careful, and not overly ambitious like some Soviet commanders, Tolbukhin was well respected by fellow commanders and also his men, especially since he had a dedication to keeping casualty rates low. Tolbukhin was the recipient of numerous awards and medals including the highest Soviet medal and rank, the Victory Order and Hero of the Soviet Union, respectively. Tolbukhin was also a hero of Yugoslavia, whose capital Belgrade he liberated. The urn containing his ashes is buried in the Kremlin necropolis wall, and there is a monument to him in his native Yaroslavl.

In 1919 the road got back its old name, V√°mh√°z k√∂r√∫t, which it bore until 1942, when it was once more renamed, this time after son of Regent of Hungary, Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy, Istv√°n Horthy. In 1945, the road was named after Marshal Tolbukhin (Tolbuhin Boulevard), and it held this name until 1990 with the fall of communism. A Monument to Fyodor Tolbukhin was installed in 1960 in Moscow in the square on Samotychnaya Street. The authors of the monument are the sculptor L. E. Kerbel and the architect G. A. Zakharov.

Facta was born in Pinerolo, Piedmont, Italy. He studied law and later became a journalist. He entered politics in 1892 when he was elected to the chamber of deputies for Pinerolo, a seat which he held for 30 years. Facta, a member of the Liberal Party, served as undersecretary of the justice and interior departments in the coalition cabinet for much of his time in Parliament. He was also the Italian Minister of Finance from 1910 until 1914 and 1920 until 1921. At the outbreak of World War I, Facta supported neutrality for Italy, but then supported the war when Italy entered it. His son was killed in the war, and he said that he was proud to give a son to his country. Facta was appointed Prime Minister in February 1922. At the time, Italy was in political turmoil, and was dealing with Mussolini's fascist insurgency. When Mussolini decided to march on Rome, Facta reacted and wanted to declare the martial law and send the army to stop Mussolini. Such a declaration needed to bear the monarch's signature before it could take effect. Facta always refused to explain the secret reasons that brought the King, Victor Emmanuel III, not to sign the declaration of emergency. The following day Facta and his government resigned to demonstrate they did not approve the King's decision. The King then requested that Mussolini come to Rome to form a new government. In 1924, King Victor Emmanuel III named Facta senator. Facta died in Pinerolo, Italy, in 1930 with the general population believing him to have been too feeble and faithful to the King to take a more active role in stopping Mussolini and the rise of Fascism.

Dƒ´pankara (Sanskrit and Pali ', \\"Lamp bearer\\") is one of the Buddhas of the past. He is said to have lived on Earth one hundred thousand aeons ago. According to some Buddhist traditions, Dƒ´pankara was a Buddha who reached enlightenment eons prior to Gautama Buddha, the historical Buddha. Generally, Buddhists believe that there has been a succession of many Buddhas in the distant past and that many more will appear in the future; Dƒ´pankara, then, would be one of numerous previous Buddhas, while Gautama was the most recent, and Maitreya will be the next Buddha in the future. Chinese Buddhism tends to honor Dƒ´pankara as one of many Buddhas of the past. Dƒ´pankara, Gautama, and Maitreya are \\"the Buddhas of Three Times\\" in Yiguandao.  Iconography  Statues of Dƒ´pankara in Kathmandu. left Dƒ´pankara is generally represented as a sitting Buddha, but his depictions as a standing Buddha are common in China, Thailand, and Nepal; with the right hand he generally forms a protection mudra (abhaya mudra), and often he forms it with both hands. Dƒ´pankara is rarely depicted alone; one of the Buddhas of Bamiyan, destroyed by the Taliban government in Afghanistan in 2001, was said to portray Dƒ´pankara. Statues of Dƒ´pankara can also be found in the Longmen and Yungang Grottoes in China. He is generally depicted with two bodhisattvas, Manjusri and Vajrapani (common in Java) or Avalokite≈õvara and Vajrapani (common in Sri Lanka); or with the Buddhas who come after him, Gautama and Maitreya.  Prediction  One story shown in Buddhist art stupas has Gautama Buddha (also known as Shakyamuni) in a former incarnation known as Sumedha, a rich Brahmin turned hermit kneeling and laying his long black hair on the ground, in an act of piety that the Dƒ´pankara Buddha could cross a puddle of mud without soiling his feet. This story between Dƒ´pankara Buddha and Sumedha occurred many lifetimes before Sumedha's eventual enlightenment as Shakyamuni Buddha. From this act, Dƒ´pankara told Sumedha \\"In the ages of the future you will come to be a Buddha called 'Shakyamuni'\\", to which Sumedha replied, \\"I am to become a Buddha, awakened to enlightenment; may you tread with your feet on my hair - on my birth, old age, and death.\\" Dƒ´pankara Buddha then said, \\"Freed from human existence, you will become an effective teacher, for the sake of the world. Born among the Shakyas, as the epitome of the Triple World, the Lamp of all Beings, you will be known as Gautama. You will be the son of King Suddhodana and Queen Maya. Sariputta and Moggallana will be your chief disciples. Your caretaker will be named Ananda.\\" In the 40-plus years of his life after enlightenment, the Buddha Shakayamuni is said to have recounted almost 554 past life stories, (called Jataka tales) of his prior existences. Gautama Buddha is quoted as saying a person starts the journey to become a Buddha filling 10 Paramita or \\"perfections\\". Some sources and scriptures recount that the Bodhisattva Gautama was born as Prince Sumedha in the time of Dƒ´pankara Buddha, and was rich and gave away all his wealth to become a monk. It is said that Gautama Bodhisattva received his first Niyatha Vivarana, (or definite foresighting by a Buddha) from Dƒ´pankara Buddha. This encounter, among many other predictions of Shakyamuni Buddha's future enlightenment, can be found in a Mahayana text named the Sangatha Sutra.Sanghata Sutra  Veneration  By the 17th century, Dƒ´pankara had become a figure of veneration in Nepalese Buddhist communities. These followers consider him a protector of merchants and associate him with alms-giving. He is also considered the protector of sailors, and sometimes statues of Dƒ´pankara are found on the coastline to guide and protect the ships in their route. Folk worshippers in Taiwan also revere Dƒ´pankara. The Buddhavamsa says that Dipamkara achieved Nirvana in Nandarama, where a stupa was built which was thirty six yojanas high.

It is based on the book of the same name, and was broadcast on NBC on November 14‚Äì15, 1976.  Plot  After suffering a small breakdown in front of her students (and then be forced to hear a neighbor play Chopin‚Äôs √âtude in A Minor, ‚ÄúWinter Wind‚Äù, incessantly), Sybil Dorsett is given a neurological examination by Dr. Cornelia Wilbur, a psychiatrist. She admits to having blackouts and fears they are getting worse. Dr. Wilbur theorizes that the incidents are a kind of hysteria, all related to a deeper problem. She asks Sybil to return at a later date for more counseling. Sybil says she will have to ask her father. Sybil's father, Willard Dorsett, and her stepmother, Freida, are in New York on a visit. Sybil meets them at a cafeteria for lunch. She explains to her father that the problems she used to have as a young girl have returned and that she wants to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Wilbur. Sybil's parents make it clear to Sybil that they disapprove of psychiatrists and psychiatry, saying how evil and controlling psychiatrists are. Sybil becomes upset and dissociates into Peggy, who becomes enraged and breaks a glass. Peggy angrily storms out of the cafeteria. Later that evening, Dr. Wilbur receives a late night call from someone who identifies herself as Vickie and says Sybil is about to jump out a hotel window. Dr. Wilbur rescues Sybil, who denies knowing Vickie. Suddenly, Sybil becomes hysterical and begins speaking like a young girl. This girl introduces herself as Peggy, and Wilbur realizes that Sybil is suffering from dissociative identity disorder, previously known as multiple personality disorder. Vickie introduces herself to Wilbur at the next session. Vickie, who knows everything about the other personalities, tells Wilbur about some of them, including Marcia, who is suicidal and wants to kill herself, and Vanessa, who plays the piano although Sybil has not played in years and swears she forgot how to play piano. Over the weeks, each of the personalities introduce themselves to Wilbur. At the same time, the personality Vanessa falls in love with a charming neighbor named Richard. Wilbur finally explains to Sybil about the other personalities. As proof, Wilbur plays the session's tape to allow Sybil to hear their voices, but when a voice that sounds like Sybil's mother Hattie speaks, an infant personality named Ruthie emerges. Wilbur is unable to communicate with the pre-verbal child and must wait until Sybil returns. Life becomes more chaotic for Sybil as the other personalities grow stronger. The personalities make Dr. Wilbur a Christmas card, but Sybil made everything purple, a color that frightens Peggy. Dr. Wilbur hypnotizes Vickie and asks about the purple. Vickie relates a memory of a time Sybil's mother locked young Sybil in the wheat bin in the barn. Thinking she was smothering, Sybil used her purple crayon to scratch on the inside of the bin so someone would know she had been there. Vanessa invites Richard and his son Matthew to have Christmas dinner, after which Richard spends the night in Sybil's apartment. Sybil has a nightmare and awakens as Marcia, who tries to throw herself off the roof. Richard rescues her and calls Wilbur. Soon afterwards, Richard moves away, crushing both Sybil and Vanessa. Once again confronted with her diagnosis, Sybil attempts to convince Wilbur that she has in fact been faking all of the other personalities the entire time and denies that multiple personalities exist within her. Wilbur goes in search of Sybil's father, who mentions that Sybil's mother Hattie was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, but denies that she ever abused Sybil. Wilbur also seeks out Sybil's pediatrician. The doctor gives Wilbur a frightening account of extensive internal scarring he found while treating Sybil for a bladder problem. Finally, Wilbur visits the old Dorsett house, where she discovers the green kitchen Sybil's selves have described many times. She also finds the purple crayon scratches inside the wheat bin. She takes them back to New York City to prove all the memories really happened. Dr. Wilbur takes Sybil for a drive, during which Peggy reveals the horrific physical abuse she suffered at her mother's hands. After Peggy exhausts herself, Sybil emerges, remembering everything that Peggy has just said. Finally, she is able to express her rage against her mother. Dr. Wilbur hypnotizes Sybil to introduce her to the other personalities. Sybil, who has always been frightened of Peggy, meets her at last and is surprised that she is only a young girl. Sybil embraces a weeping Peggy. A voiceover from Dr. Wilbur explains that after this incident, Sybil recovered her memories and went on to live a full and happy life as an academic.

Production Sally Field stars in the title role, with Joanne Woodward playing the part of Sybil's psychiatrist, Cornelia B. Wilbur. Woodward herself had starred in The Three Faces of Eve, in which she portrayed a woman with three personalities, winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for the role. Based on the book Sybil by Flora Rheta Schreiber, the movie dramatizes the life of a shy young graduate student, Sybil Dorsett (in real life, Shirley Ardell Mason), suffering from dissociative identity disorder as a result of the psychological trauma she suffered as a child. With the help of her psychiatrist, Sybil gradually recalls the severe child abuse that led to the development of 16 different personalities. Field's portrayal of Sybil won much critical acclaim, as well as an Emmy Award. Edited and unedited versions DVD of Sybil The film, originally 198 minutes long, was initially shown over the course of two nights on NBC in 1976.

He won an Academy Award in 1948 for producing the short movie Climbing the Matterhorn. In the early 1950s he formed Warwick Films with partner Albert \\"Cubby\\" Broccoli and relocated to England to leverage film making against a subsidy offered by the British government. Through the 1950s they each became known as one of the best independent film producers of the day, as the two would sometimes work in tandem, but more often than not on independent projects for their joint enterprise producing multiple projects in a given year. Biography Born in Lemberg (Austro-Hungary), Allen entered film as an editor at Universal, Paramount and Republic in 1929. During the 1940s, he made a number of superb shorts, including the Academy Award-nominated Forty Boys and a Song 1941, which he directed. His short films often won more acclaim than his low-budget features. In the late 1940s, Allen started concentrating more fully on being a producer. =Warwick Films= In the early 1950s, he led Warwick Films as the 'name producer', making films in both the US and England, with Albert R. Broccoli something of a junior partner. In 1957‚Äì1958, his partnership with Broccoli was strained both by Broccoli's family health crises (His second wife became terminally ill, soon after adopting one child and with a newborn) and to a lesser extent their disagreement over the film potential of the James Bond novel series. Broccoli was very interested, believing the novel series could lead to a high quality series of films, and Allen was not, eschewing the potential of Broccoli's vision of what became the action-adventure genre which was established by the advent of Bond in favor of older established forms. The pair met with Bond author Ian Fleming separately in 1957, Cubby from New York where he'd retreated to care for his wife, but in the London meeting with Fleming arranged by Broccoli, Allen all but insulted Fleming, declaring that Fleming's novels weren't even \\"good enough for television\\". Broccoli mired in his troubles in New York, only knew that no deal had occurred until pre- production meetings with Fleming which resulted in the decision to make the Dr. No, as the first film project by Eon Productions. In 1959, captivated by the historical importance and a good script Warwick undertook the risky project of producing, funding, and distributing the controversial film The Trials of Oscar Wilde, which was released in 1960. Ahead of the times its frank unprejudiced depiction of homosexual issues ran into a ratings stone wall in the United States all but preventing any sort of advertising, and the company lost its large investment, Broccoli and Allen fell out, and the partnership became moribund, being dissolved officially in a 1961 bankruptcy liquidation. Thus the two partners each turned into solo producers in late 1960. Broccoli went on to found Danjaq, S.A. and Eon Productions with Harry Saltzman beginning the Bond films on a shoestring budget, and Allen occupied himself with other projects. =Matt Helm= Some years later, Allen cast about for his own spy series. He acquired the rights to Donald Hamilton's Matt Helm series. Allen was responsible for the Matt Helm series, The Silencers (1966), Murderers' Row (1966), The Ambushers (1967), and The Wrecking Crew (1969). In July 1967 Allen said \\"At this stage I\\"m only interested in making money. I'm not interested in kudos or getting good reviews - I've had all that. I'm just concerned with getting the greatest number of people into theatres.\\"Allen at Helm of Production Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times 6 July 1967: e14. \\"I've done practically everything,\\" he said. \\"There's no place I haven't been in the business. The only thing I can't do is write.\\" Allen's Helm series had one major effect on Broccoli's Bond movies (produced at the time in partnership with Harry Saltzman). To get Dean Martin on board as Matt Helm, Allen had to make the actor a partner in the enterprise. Dean Martin ended up making more money on The Silencers (1966) than Sean Connery made on Thunderball (1965). This did not go unnoticed by Connery. Allen was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood, California.

It has become the most widely read and critically acclaimed novel in the Chicano literary canon since its first publication in 1972.Writing the Southwest retrieved March 31, 2012.Tonn, H. (1990). Bless Me, Ultima: Fictional response to times of transition. In C√©sar A. Gonz√°lez-T. (Ed.),Rudolfo A. Anaya: Focus on Criticism. La Jolla, CA: Lalo Press. Teachers across disciplines in middle schools, high schools and universities have adopted it as a way to implement multicultural literature in their classes. The novel reflects Hispano culture of the 1940s in rural New Mexico. Anaya's use of Spanish, mystical depiction of the New Mexican landscape, use of cultural motifs such as La Llorona, and recounting of curandera folkways such as the gathering of medicinal herbs, gives readers a sense of the influence of indigenous cultural ways that are both authentic and distinct from the mainstream. Bless Me, Ultima is Anaya's best known work and was awarded the prestigious Premio Quinto Sol. In 2008, it was one of 12 classic American novels selected for The Big Read, a community-reading program sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts, and in 2009, it was the selected novel of the United States Academic Decathlon. Bless Me, Ultima is the first in a trilogy that continued with the publication of Heart of Aztlan (1976) and Tortuga (1979). With the publication of his novel, Alburquerque (1992), Anaya was proclaimed a front-runner by Newsweek in \\"what is better called not the new multicultural writing, but the new American writing.\\" Owing to what some consider adult language, violent content, and sexual references, Bless Me, Ultima is often the target of attempts to restrict access to the book and was therefore placed on the list of most commonly challenged books in the U.S. in 2013. However, In the last third of the twentieth century, the novel has initiated respect for Chicano literature as an important and nonderivative type of American literature among academics. Creation and purpose as an autobiography Bringing Bless Me, Ultima to fruition took Anaya six years and an additional two years to find a publisher. From 1965 to 1971,Hispanic Heritage Rudolfo Anaya retrieved January 6, 2012. Anaya struggled to find his own \\"voice\\" as the literary models he knew and had studied at the University of New Mexico (BA English, 1963) did not fit him as a writer. He has also remarked on the unavailability of many authors at that time who could serve as mentors for his life experience as a Chicano.Bless Me, Ultima Audio Guide ‚Äì Listen! retrieved and transcribed January 2, 2012. Anaya says that the great breakthrough in finding his voice as a writer occurred in an evening when he was writing late at night. He was struggling to find a way to get the novel to come together and then: This was the epiphany that Anaya believes came from his subconscious to provide him a mentor and his spiritual guide to the world of his Native American experience (115).Anaya, R. (1987). \\"An American Chicano in King Arthur's Court\\" in Judy Nolte Lensink (Ed.), Old Southwest/New Southwest: Essays on a region and its literature, 113‚Äì118. In Anaya's first novel, his life becomes the model for expressing the complex process of growing up Chicano in the American Southwest. Michael Fink characterizes Anaya's work as \\"the search for a sense of place.\\"Fink, Michael (2004). \\"Narratives of a new belonging: The politics of memory and identity in contemporary American Ethnic Literatures\\". Masters of Arts thesis, Institute for American Studies, University of Regensburg,Germany‚ÄîBavaria. ISBN (eBook):978-3-638-32081-8,ISBN (Book):978-3-638-70343-7.(cf. Chapter 4 \\"The Search for a Sense of Place\\"). And the author tells us, \\"Bless Me, Ultima takes place in a small town in eastern New Mexico and it is really the setting of my home town Santa Rosa, New Mexico. Many of the characters that appear are my childhood friends.\\" The autobiographical relationship between Anaya and his first novel best begins through the author's own words as he reflects on his life's work as an artist and as a Chicano: Anaya's authenticity to speak about the Chicano worldview is grounded in the history of his family. He is a descendant from the Hispanos, who originally settled the land grant in Albuquerque called \\"La Merced de Atrisco\\" in the Rio Grande Valley (2).Fern√°ndez Olmos, M. (1999). Rudolfo A. Anaya: A critical companion. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. Anaya chooses Maria Luna de M√°rez as the name of Antonio's mother, which parallels his own mother's surname, and her cultural and geographical origins: Rafaelita Mares, the daughter of farmers from a small village near Santa Rosa called Puerto De Luna. In additional ways Anaya's family and that of his young protagonist parallel: Both Rafaelita's first and second husbands were vaqueros (cowboys) who preferred life riding horses, herding cattle and roaming the llano, as did Antonio's father, Gabriel. Anaya's family also included two older brothers who left to fight WWII and four sisters. Thus, Anaya grew up in a family constellation similar to that of his young protagonist. Anaya's life and that of Antonio parallel in other ways that ground the conflict with which his young protagonist struggles in advancing to adolescence. As a small child Anaya moved with his family from Las Pasturas, his relatively isolated birthplace on the llano to Santa Rosa, a \\"city\\" by New Mexico standards of the time. This move plays a large part in the first chapter of Anaya's first novel as it sets the stage for Antonio's father's great disappointment in losing the lifestyle of the llano that he loved so well, and perhaps the kindling of his dream to embark on a new adventure to move with his sons to California‚Äîa dream that never would be. Historical context Bless Me, Ultima focuses on a young boy's spiritual transformation amidst cultural and societal changes in the American Southwest during World War II. Anaya's work aims to reflect the uniqueness of the Hispano experience in the context of modernization in New Mexico‚Äîa place bearing the memory of European and indigenous cultures in contact spanning nearly half a millennium. The relationship between Anaya's protagonist, Antonio and his spiritual guide, Ultima, unfolds in an enchanted landscape that accommodates cultural, religious, moral and epistemological contradictions: M√°rez vs. Luna, the Golden Carp vs. the Christian God, good vs. evil, Ultima's way of knowing vs. the Church's or the school's way of knowing.Park, Cynthia Darche (2002). ‚ÄúUltima: Myth, magic and mysticism in teaching and learning.‚Äù In Jose Villarino & Arturo Ramirez (Eds.), Aztl√°n, Chicano culture and folklore: An anthology, (3rd Edition). pp. 187‚Äì198. Cynthia Darche Park, a professor at San Diego State University, claims \\"These contradictions reflect political conquest and colonization that in the first instance put the Hispano-European ways of thinking, believing, and doing in the power position relative to those of the indigenous peoples.\\" (188) New Mexico experienced a second wave of European influence‚Äîthis time English speaking‚Äîwhich was definitively marked by U.S. victory in the war between the United States and Mexico that ended with The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. According to Richard Griswold del Castillo, \\"The treaty established a pattern of political and military inequality between the two countries, and this lopsided relationship has stalked Mexican-U.S relations ever since.\\"Richard Griswold del Castillo.

Thereafter, the Spanish built permanent communities for the Indians along the Rio Grande and introduced domesticated animals to the area, all while striving for religious conversion of the native communities. The Spanish subjugated the native people to build mission churches in each of the new villages, but the Pueblo Indians finally rebelled in 1680 and drove the Spanish out of their land. In 1692, the Spanish, led by Don Diego de Vargas, reconquered New Mexico. This time colonizers were able to coexist with the Pueblo Indians. The Spanish established many communities in which Catholicism and the Spanish language combined with the culture and myths of the Pueblo Indians. New Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821 and eventually achieved independent statehood in the United States of America in 1912. The mixed cultural influences and a long history of intermarriage among the Hispanos and the indigenous peoples (i.e.,the mestizaje) remained largely intact throughout rural New Mexico well into the 20th century. The colonization of New Mexico by Spanish colonists resulted, therefore, in a combination of indigenous myths with Catholicism. As the Hispano community's beliefs and ways of doing things interacted with those of the Native Americans, a cultural pattern evolved in which indigenous myth maintained importance alongside Catholic doctrine. As modernization spread across the United States with completion of the transcontinental railway in the 1860s and establishment of the Rural Electrification Administration in the 1930s, isolated rural communities were changed forever.Florence Dean, Celebrating Electrical Power In Rural New Mexico retrieved January 12, 2012 The Second World War in the 1940s also wrought change as young men were sent to far off places and returned to their homeland bearing the vestiges of violent, traumatic experiences and exposure to a cosmopolitan world. Because of the horrors that Antonio's brothers experienced in the war, none of them are able to integrate themselves back into the quiet life of Guadalupe; Antonio describes them as ‚Äúdying giants‚Äù because they can no longer cope with the life that they left behind when they went to war. Their decision to leave Guadalupe is indirectly linked to their experiences in the war. The impact of modernization and war, therefore, did not exclude the Hispanos and indigenous peoples of New Mexico as the boundaries of their previously insular communities were crossed by these external technological and cultural influences. Anaya dramatizes the pressures of change in the New Mexican peoples' response to the detonation of the first atomic test bomb near Alamogordo, New Mexico July 16, 1945 as apocalyptic: Tonn reminds us that both the narrated time and the moment of the novel's first appearance were periods of transition. The United States in the decades of the 1960s and 70's underwent a series of deep societal changes which some scholars deem to have been as apocalyptic to U.S. society as the detonation of the Atomic bomb was to the New Mexican peoples in 1945. Berger (2000:388),cited in Keyword:Apocalypse, outlines two additional areas of post war apocalyptic representation after (1) nuclear war, and (2) the Holocaust. They are (3) apocalypses of liberation (feminist, African American, postcolonial) and (4) what is loosely called \\"postmodernity\\". Anaya's writing of Bless Me, Ultima coincided with one of the principal upheavals of the move toward liberation, the Civil Rights Movement including the Chicano farm labor movement led by Cesar Chavez. Tonn points out that events surrounding the struggle for civil rights, the Vietnam War, the assassination of John F. Kennedy and later of Martin Luther King Jr., urban disturbances such as Watts and Detroit posed deep-seated \\"challenges to the dominant self-image of United States Society‚Ä¶\\" \\"‚Ä¶leading to fundamental shifts in societal values and mores.\\" Tonn and Robert Cant√∫Cant√∫, R.

Plot summary Set in the small town of Guadalupe, New Mexico, just after World War II, Antonio M√°rez y Luna (Tony) tells his story from the memories of his adult self, who reflects on his growing up. The novel opens as the protagonist, Antonio, approaches the age of seven when his family decides to house Ultima, an elderly curandera. Ultima, known as ‚ÄúLa Grande‚Äù in the M√°rez household, embodies the wisdom of her ancestors and carries the powers to heal, to confront evil, knowledge of how to use the power of nature and the ability to understand the relationship between the living and the spirits. Tony's parents both hold conflicting views about Tony's destiny and battle over his future path. In the first chapter Anaya establishes the roots of this struggle through Tony's dream‚Äîa flashback to the day of his birth. In his dream, Tony views the differences between his parents' familial backgrounds. His father's side, the M√°rez (descendants of the sea), are the restless vaqueros who roam the llanos and seek adventure. The Lunas, his mother's side, are the people of the moon, religious farmers whose destiny is to homestead and work the land. Each side of the family wants control of the newborn's future. His mother's dream is for him to become a Roman Catholic priest, his father's dream is to embark on a new adventure and move west to California with his sons to recapture the openness of the Llano he has foregone in moving to the town. As the two families argue over Antonio's destiny, Ultima, serving as the midwife, declares, ‚ÄúOnly I will know his destiny.‚Äù Following an immediate bond with Ultima, Antonio learns of the many herbs and barks, which she uses in her ceremonies. Tony's progress in learning about life is grounded in Ultima, who is highly respected by his parents. However, one night Antonio witnesses the death of a man back from the war, which makes him question his religion and identity, and sparks his journey towards manhood. Antonio begins school in the fall, where he is portrayed as an excelling student, which greatly pleases his mother. Tony's First Communion experience leaves him disillusioned as he did not receive the spiritual knowledge he had expected. He begins to question the value of the Catholic Church, concentrated on the Virgin Mary and a Father God, and on ritual, as unable to answer his moral and metaphysical dilemmas. At the same time, realizing that the Church represents the female values of his mother, Tony cannot bring himself to accept the lawlessness, violence and unthinking sensuality which his father and older brothers symbolize. Instead through his relationship with Ultima, he discovers a oneness with nature.Kanoza, T. M. (1999, Summer). \\"The golden carp and Moby Dick: Rudolfo Anaya‚Äôs multi- culturalism\\". Melus, 24, 1‚Äì10. Through his discovery that \\"All is One\\" he is able to resolve the major existential conflict in his life. One day, while socializing with his friends they tell him the story of the Golden Carp. Antonio also continues to be an example for the children, who praise his religious savant as they dress him as a priest while preparing for first communion. Antonio's admiration for Ultima strengthens as he continues to question his faith, hoping to understand once he takes communion for the first time. When Antonio's Uncle Lucas falls ill, presumably due to a curse by Tenorio's three evil daughters, Antonio must come to grips with the opposition between good and evil. Ultima, in her role as protector, uses her knowledge of healing and magic to neutralize the evil witchcraft and, despite lacking priestly recognition, emerges as the only one who can save him from death. In another traumatic death, Antonio witnesses the murder of Narciso, known as the town drunk, by Tenorio, a malicious saloon-keeper and barber in El Puerto. As a result, Antonio becomes ill and enters a dream-like state. Tenorio blames Ultima for the death of one of his daughters, claiming that his daughter passed because Ultima cursed her. Tenorio plots his revenge on Ultima throughout the duration of the novel. The determined Tenorio emerges in the final scenes as he chases Antonio back to the M√†rez house, where Tenorio shoots Ultima's owl. Following the death of the owl, Ultima quickly follows and is accompanied by Antonio at her bedside as she dies. Before her death, she instructs Antonio to collect her medicines and herbs before destroying them by the river. At the conclusion of the novel, Antonio reflects on the tension that he feels as he is pulled between his father's free, open landscape of the llano, and his mother's circumscribed river valley of the town. In addition, he reflects on the pull between Catholicism and the continuation of Ultima's spiritual legacy and concludes that he does not need to choose one over the other, but can bring both together to form a new identity and a new religion that is made up of both. Antonio says to his father: =Characters= Antonio Juan M√°rez y Luna ‚Äì Antonio is seven and serious, thoughtful, and prone to moral questioning, and his experiences force him to confront difficult issues that blur the lines between right and wrong. He turns to both pagan and Christian ideologies for guidance, but he doubts both traditions. With Ultima's help, Antonio makes the transition from childhood to adolescence and begins to make his own choices and to accept responsibility for their consequences. Gabriel M√°rez and Maria Luna ‚Äì Tony's parents. Both hold conflicting views about Tony's destiny and battle over his future path. While Gabriel represents the roaming life of a vaquero and hopes for Tony to follow this path of life, Maria represents the settled life of hard-working farmers and aspires for her son to become a priest. Ultima ‚Äì An elderly curandera, known in the M√°rez household as \\"La Grande\\" is the embodiment of the wisdom of her ancestors and carries within her the powers to heal, to confront evil, to use the power of nature and to understand the relationship between the seen and unseen. Her role in the community is as mediator. \\"She preserves the indispensable contact with the world of nature and the supernatural forces inhabiting this universe (255).\\"Cazemajou,Jean. (1990).

Ultima knows the ways of the Catholic Church and also the ways of the indigenous spiritual practices over which she is master. Ultima understands the philosophy and the morality of the ancient peoples of New Mexico and teaches Tony through example, experience and critical reflection, the universal principles that explain and sustain life. Although she is generally respected in the community, people sometimes misunderstand her power. At times she is referred to as a bruja, or witch, but no one‚Äînot even Antonio‚Äîknows whether or not she is truly a witch. Finally Antonio puts pieces of the puzzle together and the revelation of who she is comes to him. She holds Antonio's destiny in her hands, and at the end of the story sacrifices her own life so that Antonio might live. Tenorio Trementina and his three daughters ‚Äì Tenorio is a malicious saloon-keeper and barber in El Puerto. His three daughters perform a black mass and place a curse on Antonio's uncle Lucas Luna. Tenorio detests Ultima because she lifts the curse on Lucas and soon after she does so, one of Tenorio's daughters dies. Hot-tempered and vengeful, Tenorio spends the rest of the novel plotting Ultima's death, which he finally achieves by killing her owl familiar, her spiritual guardian. Afterwards, he tries to kill Antonio but is shot by Uncle Pedro. Ultima's Owl ‚Äì Embodies Ultima's soul, the power of her mysticism, and her life force. The song the owl sings softly outside Antonio's window at night indicates Ultima's presence and magical protection in Antonio's life. Ultima's owl scratches Tenorio's eye out as he stands in Gabriel's doorway and demands the right to take Ultima away from Gabriel's house. By the end of the novel Tenorio has figured out the connection between Ultima and her owl. By killing Ultima's owl, Tenorio destroys Ultima's soul and life force, which leads quickly to her death. Antonio takes on the responsibility of burying the owl and realizes that he is really burying Ultima. Lupito ‚Äì A war veteran who has post- traumatic stress disorder. After Lupito murders the local sheriff in one of his deranged moments, he is killed by the sheriff and his posse as young Antonio looks on from his hiding place on the banks of the river. Lupito's violent death provides the catalyst for Antonio's serious moral and religious questioning. \\"Lucas Luna\\" ‚Äì Antonio's uncle, who gets cursed by the Trementina sisters when he tries to stop them from practicing black magic. As a result, he gets so sick that Ultima is summoned to cure him. She concocts a potion of herbs, water, and kerosene as a purgative and uses Antonio's innocence as a mediator to effect the cure. Narciso ‚Äì Although known as the town drunk, Narciso cuts a large, strong figure of a man. Narciso and Gabriel are good friends because they share a deep and passionate love for the llano. Narciso has a deep abiding loyalty and love for Ultima because of her extraordinary efforts to save his young wife who had succumbed to an epidemic that struck the town. Narciso demonstrates a strong appreciation for the richness of the earth ‚Äîhis garden is a lush masterpiece full of sweet vegetables and fruits. Tenorio kills him as he is on his way to warn Ultima that Tenorio is after her. As he lies dying in Antonio's arms, he asks Antonio to give him a blessing. T√©llez ‚Äì One of Gabriel's friends. He challenges Tenorio when Tenorio speaks badly of Ultima. Not long afterward, a curse is laid on his home. Ultima agrees to lift the curse, explaining that T√©llez's grandfather once hanged three Comanche Indians for raiding his flocks. Ultima performs a Comanche funeral ceremony on T√©llez's land, and ghosts cease to haunt his home. Antonio's friends: Abel, Bones, Ernie, Horse, Lloyd, Red, and the Vitamin Kid ‚Äì An exuberant group of boys who frequently curse and fight. Horse loves to wrestle, but everyone fears Bones more because he is reckless and perhaps even crazy. Ernie is a braggart who frequently teases Antonio. The Vitamin Kid is the fastest runner in Guadalupe. Red is a Protestant, so he is often teased by the other boys. Lloyd enjoys reminding everyone that they can be sued for even the most minor offenses. Abel, the smallest boy in the group, frequently urinates in inappropriate places. Samuel ‚Äì One of Antonio's friends. He is also the Vitamin Kid's brother. Unlike most of Antonio's friends, Samuel is gentle and quiet. He tells Antonio about the golden carp. It is here that Antonio starts questioning his faith. Florence ‚Äì One of Antonio's friends who does not believe in God, but goes to catechism to be with his friends. Florence shows Antonio that the Catholic Church is not perfect. He dies in a very bad drowning accident. Jas√≥n Ch√°vez ‚Äì One of Antonio's friends. He disobeys his father when he continues to visit an Indian who lives near the town. He is described by Antonio as being moody. Jas√≥n Ch√°vez's Indian ‚Äì A friend of Jas√≥n's who is disliked by Jas√≥n's father. Cico tells Antonio that the story of the golden carp originally comes from the Indian. Andrew, Eugene, and Le√≥n M√°rez ‚Äì Antonio's brothers. For most of Antonio's childhood, his brothers are fighting in World War II. When they return home, they suffer post-traumatic stress as a result of the war. Restless and depressed, they all eventually leave home to pursue independent lives, crushing Gabriel's dream of moving his family to California. Deborah and Theresa M√°rez ‚Äì Antonio's older sisters. Most of the time, they play with dolls and speak English, a language Antonio does not begin to learn until he attends school. Antonio's uncles ‚Äì Juan, Lucas, Mateo, and Pedro Luna ‚Äì Mar√≠a's brothers are farmers. They struggle with Gabriel to lay a claim to Antonio's future. They want him to become a farmer or a priest, but Gabriel wants Antonio to be a vaquero in the M√°rez tradition. Antonio's uncles are quiet and gentle, and they plant their crops by the cycle of the moon. Father Byrnes ‚Äì A stern Catholic priest with hypocritical and unfair policies. He teaches catechism to Antonio and his friends. He punishes Florence for the smallest offenses because Florence challenges the Catholic orthodoxy, but he fails to notice, and perhaps even ignores, the misbehavior of the other boys. Rather than teach the children to understand God, he teaches them to fear God. Ch√°vez ‚Äì Ch√°vez is the father of Antonio's friend Jas√≥n. Distraught and vengeful, he leads a mob to find Lupito after Lupito kills Ch√°vez's brother, the local sheriff. He forbids Jas√≥n to visit an Indian who lives near the town, but Jas√≥n disobeys him. Prudencio Luna ‚Äì The father of Mar√≠a and her brothers. He is a quiet man who prefers not to become involved in other peoples‚Äô conflicts. When Tenorio declares an all out war against Ultima, he does not want his sons to get involved, even though Ultima saved Lucas's life. Miss Maestas ‚Äì Antonio's first-grade teacher. Although Antonio does not speak English well, Miss Maestas recognizes his bright spark of intelligence. Under her tutelage, Antonio unlocks the secrets of words. She promotes him to the third grade at the end of the year. Miss Violet ‚Äì Antonio's third grade teacher. He, with Abel, Bones, Ernie, Horse, Lloyd, Red, and the Vitamin Kid, set up a play about the First Christmas on a dark and snowy night, which turns into a hilarious disaster because of the ever crazy Bones. Rosie ‚Äì The woman who runs the local brothel. Antonio has a deep fear of the brothel because it represents sin. He is devastated when he finds out that his brother Andrew frequently goes to it. The flying man ‚Äì This man was Ultima's teacher and was also known as el hombre volador. He gave her the owl that became her spirit familiar, her guardian, and her soul. He told her to do good works with her powers, but to avoid interfering with a person's destiny. The invocation of his name inspires awe and respect among the people who have heard about his legendary powers and incites fear in Tenorio Trementina.  Literary interpretations  = Development of an \\"American Mestizaje\\", Antonio's boon = After the Mexican Revolution of 1910, the state officially constructed a Mexican national identity policy on the proposition that Mexicans are the product of a creative mixing of Indians and Europeans‚Äîthat is, about a fusing together of cultures. This doctrine is expressed in official rhetoric, mythology and public ceremonial. In practice, however, the emphasis on culture gets conflated with the biological mixing of races, mestizaje in Spanish. The Revolution's goals included returning to Mexico's indigenous peoples their dignity as full-fledged citizens by relieving them from a history of exploitation, providing them with material progress and social justice. In return for this, Mexican Indians would give up their old customs, speak Spanish and join the mainstream of national life, defined as mestizo, the biological issue of mixed-race parentage. Thus, the Mexican \\"Mestizaje\\" has come to represent a policy of cultural assimilation.Mestizaje and Indigenous Identities retrieved March 30, 2012. A number of Anaya critics and at least one Chicana novelist view his young protagonist's path to adolescence as a spiritual search for a personal identity. The result embodies the synergistic integration of both the cultural and biological aspects of his indigenous and European inheritances as the creation of something new.Kelly, Margot.(1997).

(Ed.)(1990).,Rudolfo A. Anaya: Focus on criticism (pp. 100‚Äì112). La Jolla, CA: Lalo Press Antonio's successful quest provides the world with a new model of cultural identity ‚Äîa new American Mestizaje for the American Mestizo known as the Chicano. This model repudiates assimilation to the mainstream culture, but embraces acceptance of our historical selves through creative adaptation to the changing world around us. Margarite Fernandez Olmos comments on the novel's pioneering position in the Chicano literary tradition: \\"Bless Me, Ultima blazed a path within the Chicano literary tradition in the [genre] 'novels of identity' in which the main characters must redefine themselves within the larger society from the vantage point of their own distinct ethnicity.\\" (17) Others, such as Denise Chavez (Face of an Angel, 1994) support Olmos' position. In an interview with Margot Kelly, Chavez concludes, \\"Anaya maintains that the kind of protagonist who will be able to become free is a person of synthesis, a person who is able to draw . . . on our Spanish roots and our native indigenous roots and become a new person, become that Mestizo with a unique perspective.\\" In general, Amy Barrias' analyses of representative coming-of-age Chicano and American Indian texts, including Bless Me, Ultima allows her to conclude that because American Indian and Chicano(a) writers find very little in dominant culture on which to build an identity, they have turned inward to create their own texts of rediscovery. (16) Michael Fink uses a wider lens to suggest that Anaya's seminal novel is a contribution to identity and memory politics that provides us with \\"a set of strategies of transcultural survival . . . [in which] former collective identities are eventually transformed into new hybrid identities of difference.\\" (6‚Äì7) Anaya uses strategies that employ the need for a mentor, and the return to ancient spiritual roots encompassing belief in magic, mysticism, and the shaman's trance. Fernandez Olmos remarks on mentorship: \\"In Bless Me, Ultima the figure of Ultima . . . is crucial. As young Antonio's guide and mentor, her teachings not only bring him into contact with a mystical, primordial world but also with a culture‚Äîhis own Hispanic/Indian culture‚Äîthat he must learn to appreciate if he is ever to truly understand himself and his place within society.\\" (17) Amy Barrias cites the novel as a prime example of the use of magical intervention as the mediator, which enables Antonio to \\"emerge from his conflicts with a blended sense of identity. [He takes] the best each culture has to offer to form a new perspective.\\"(iv) Cynthia Darche Park focuses on the shaman's initiation as the spiritual experience that allows Antonio's transcendental integration of the conflicts with which he is struggling: =Anaya as mythmaker: apocalypse as revelation, the hero's journey= ‚Äì Paul Ricoeur Robert Cant√∫ suggests that apocalypse as revelation is the ideological construct that best explains the novel's structure and purpose. His reconstructive analysis shows how Antonio, as narrator, solves and resolves his troubling metaphysical questions through a series of revelations mediated by Ultima and her otherworldly connections. As more and more is revealed to Tony, a transcendent reality is disclosed which is both temporal, insofar as it envisages eschatological salvation; and spatial, insofar as it involves another, supernatural world.Apocalyptic Defined An ideology is a set of ideas that constitute one's goals, expectations, and actions. An ideology can be thought of as a comprehensive vision, as a way of looking at things (compare worldview), as in several philosophical tendencies (see Political ideologies), or a set of ideas proposed by the dominant class of a society to all members of this society (a \\"received consciousness\\" or product of socialization). =Myth and magic as healing= Because healing is Ultima's mission, Antonio's relationship with her includes accompanying her to gather the curative herbs she knows about through tradition and spiritual revelation. With her Antonio visits the sick and begins to grasp a connection between healing and nature even though he never receives an explicit scientific or grounded explanation for how she foretells future occurrences, heals the infirm, combats witches through casting spells, or when and why she decides not to intervene. Ultima's indigenous and experiential pedagogy allows Antonio to intuit that her approach to healing includes a sense of who the afflicted person is, what s/he believes, knowledge of the healing powers of her herbs, and the limits of her power. He learns through assisting Ultima in the cure of his uncle that healing requires making himself vulnerable to sickness and to the spiritual as well as physical needs of the sick. With Antonio, Ultima's relationship as healer is also one of teacher. Cynthia Park considers the relationship between those two roles, and abstracts a set of life-giving principles that form the basis for Ultima's way of knowing. = Connections to multicultural literature = Susan Landt proposes that multicultural literature will take a wide range of perspectives from individuals within historically marginalized groups.Landt, Susan M. \\"Multicultural literature and young adolescents: a kaleidoscope of opportunity. Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy 49.8 (2006): p. 690+. Literature Resource Center. Web. 4 Oct. 2016. Heriberto Gordina, a teacher at the University of Iowa, and Rachelle McCoy, a teacher at West Branch High School in West Branch, Iowa, analyze the novel in two different perspectives of multicultural literature.Godina, Heriberto, and Rachelle McCoy. \\"Emic and Etic Perspectives on Chicana and Chicano Multicultural Literature\\". Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy 44.2 (2000): 172-9. ProQuest. Web. 13 Dec. 2016. An emic perspective takes a view of a culture within its elements whereas an etic perspective takes an objective view of culture. For the two teachers, the story takes an emic perspective as Antonio, living within a Chicano culture, must find his own identity as he analyzes and questions his own connections to the culture's various ideologies, cultures, and viewpoints throughout the narrative. Candace Morales, a graduate student pursuing a Masters of Science in Education while concentrating in Reading, proposes that in a curriculum that utilizes Bless Me Ultima as a piece of multicultural literature, it must be timed appropriately. Specifically, she suggests teaching it to middle schoolers so that they have a diverse lens (that of a Chicano/a culture) to view their own development; to Morales, Antonio's own pursuit of ‚Äúknowledge, truth, and personal identity‚Äù will resonate with the students as well.Morales, Candace A. \\"Our Own Voice\\": The Necessity of Chicano Literature in Mainstream Curriculum.\\" Multicultural Education 9.2 (2001): 16-20. ProQuest.Web. 5 Oct. 2016. Reception and legacy Rudolfo Anaya in 2006 , Bless Me, Ultima has become the best-selling Chicano novel of all time. The New York Times reports that Anaya is the most widely read author in Hispanic communities, and sales of his classic, Bless Me, Ultima (1972) have surpassed 360,000. After Quinto Sol's initial publication of Bless Me, Ultima in 1972, critics by and large responded enthusiastically. The general consensus was that the novel provided Chicano literature with a new and refreshing voice.Hispanic Heritage: Rudolfo Anaya retrieved January 7, 2012 Scott Wood, writing for America Press, asserted: By 1976, four years after Bless Me Ultima's initial publication, the new author was finding fans and fame among Chicano readers and scholars. He was in high demand as a speaker and the subject of numerous interviews primarily among journalists and publicists who were Chicanos or deeply interested in the development of Chicano literature. In the preface to his 1976 interview with Anaya reprinted in Conversations with Rudolfo Anaya (1998), Ishmael Reed states that, Bless Me Ultima, as of July 1, 1976, had sold 80,000 copies without a review in the major media.Ishmael Reed (1976). \\"An Interview with Rudolfo Anaya\\", The San Francisco Review of Books. 4.2 (1978):9‚Äì12, 34. Reprinted in Dick, B., & S. Sirias (eds), (1998), Conversations with Rudolfo Anaya. 1‚Äì10. University Press of Mississippi. For twenty-two years after the novel's initial publication (its only availability through a small publisher notwithstanding), the novel sold 300,000 copies primarily through word of mouth.Bless Me, Ultima: Introduction retrieved January 7, 2012 In this period the novel generated the largest body of review, interpretation, and analysis of any work of Chicano Literature (p. 1). Finally in 1994, a major publisher (Grand Central Publishing) issued a mass-market edition of Bless Me, Ultima to rave reviews. Terri Windling described the 1994 re-issue as \\"an important novel which beautifully melds Old World and New World folklore into a contemporary story\\".\\"Summation 1994: Fantasy,\\" The Year's Best Fantasy and Horror: Eighth Annual Collection, p. xx. = Censorship and challenges = After its publication in 1972, Bless Me, Ultima emerged as one of the \\"Top Ten Most Frequently Challenged Books\\" in the years 2013 and 2008. According to the American Library association, a challenge is an attempt to restrict access of a book through the removal of the text in curriculum and libraries. Specific reasons for the challenges in 2013 were \\"occult/Satanism, offensive language, religious viewpoint, sexually explicit\\" and similarly in 2008 of \\"occult/satanism, offensive language, religious viewpoint, sexually explicit, violence\\". A particularly vivid experience in the censorship of this book for the author, Rudolfo Anaya, was in 1981: the Bloomfield School Board in San Juan County, New Mexico burned copies of the Bless Me, Ultima.  Round Rock Independent School District (Round Rock, Texas)  In 1996, after appearing on advanced placement and local high school reading lists in Round Rock Independent school district, the novel came to parents attention, which according to Foerstel led to ‚Äúseven hours of boisterous debate over a proposal to remove a dozen books‚Äù, one of which was Bless Me, Ultima. It came on January 19, 1996 from Round Rock Independent School District Board member Nelda Click.Foerstel, Herbert N.. Banned in the U.S.A. : A Reference Guide to Book Censorship in Schools and Public Libraries. pp.228-229. Westport, US: Greenwood Press, 2002. ProQuest Ebrary. Online Library. 4 November 2016 One of the worries of the parents was excessive violence. However, a local paper, The Austin American Statesman, claimed ‚Äú Refusing to allow credit for those celebrated literary works would have been an unnecessary intrusion by the school board.‚Äù After multiple hearing and proposals, the board came to a 4-2 vote against the banning of the book.  Laton School Board (Laton, California)  In May 1999, the Laton School Board removed two books, one being Bless Me, Ultima, from teacher Carol Bennett's English classes.Foerstel, Herbert N.. Banned in the U.S.A. : A Reference Guide to Book Censorship in Schools and Public Libraries. pp 228-229. Westport, US: Greenwood Press, 2002. ProQuest Ebrary. Online Library. 4 November 2016 The removal was proposed by board member Jerry Haroldsen based on complaints from parents of Benett's students about the violence and profanity within the book. Haroldsen articulated the reasoning for the board's action: \\"What we are doing is trying to protect the children. And you got a teacher that's trying to do what we do not think is right\\". All copies of Bless Me, Ultima were pulled from the classes and placed in the principal's office.  John Jay High School (Wappingers Falls, New York)  Around 2000 in John Jay High School, Deidra DiMaso was troubled when she read Bless Me, Ultima to her two daughters. She was prompted to challenge the book's placement in the high school's ninth grade curriculum. She addressed officials within the school and district alongside directly speaking in a school board meeting in November of that year. Her reasoning was that the book ‚Äúis full of sex and cursing‚Äù; she later expanded on her policy by saying ‚ÄúI asked the board members to please review all the books for any sexual content, violence, or foul language prior to any book becoming required reading.‚Äù. The secondary source of this story, Banned in the U.S.A.: A Reference Guide to Book Censorship in Schools and Public Libraries, tells that the superintendent, Wayne Gersen, followed the standard protocol for addressing challenged materials but doesn‚Äôt specify the conclusion of the case.  Norwood School District (Grand Junction, Colorado)  In early 2005, Superintendent Bob Conder of the Norwood School District had banned Bless Me, Ultima in Norwood High School after a group of parents objected to the profanity and other themes the book contains; he himself had not read it but did enough reading to make the decision on the basis of the themes presented.Bain, Roy. \\"Banned Book Read at Protest - Norwood Superintendent Explains His Stance to High School Students.\\" Daily Sentinel, The (Grand Junction, CO). Access World News. NewsBank, Inc. 1 Feb 05 2005. Web. 4 November 2016. Copies were removed from Lisa Doyle's English class after she had used them while telling parents Conder had approved of its usage; Conder had Doyle apologize to the parents for the themes the book contains as well as lying about the status of Conder's approval. At least twenty-four of the books were given to the group who destroyed the copies. Conder still approved the presence of copies available in the school library, but in hindsight wished to have donated the book. In protest of the decision, on February 5, 2005, students formed a sit-in while reading passages from the center of the school gymnasium. They had shirts with handwritten designs of Bless Me, Ultima; however, only eight of the twenty students had heard or read of the book. Despite staying with his decision to keep the book banned, he acknowledged and respected the decision of the students to make a vocal protest. He told the students his choice was made in order to protect them while a student, Serena Campbell, responded by stating ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre sheltered all our lives, what are we going to do when we get to college? If I‚Äôm not exposed now, how am I going to get by in life?‚Äù. Conder ended the protest at midday by telling the students that he plans to stand with the decision of what a new a curriculum review committee, that will have two representatives from each grade alongside parents. Moreover, he planned to apologize to Doyle.  Blue Valley School District (Kansas City, Missouri)  In June 2005, Blue Valley School District held a challenge of Bless Me, Ultima from Georgiane Skid, a resident of the district.Sederstrom, Jill. \\"School to Keep Disputed Novels.\\" Kansas City Star, The (MO). Access World News. NewsBank, Inc. Jun 02 2005. Web. 4 November 2016. She requested the school board discuss the appropriateness of this novel being studied by the freshman class in a communications arts class. A committee made up of two students, two teachers, and two parents unanimously voted to keep the novel in the curriculum.  Newman-Crows Landing Unified School District (Newman, California)  In Orestimba High School on November 23, 2008, Superintendent Rick Fauss from the Newman-Crows Landing Unified School District banned the book on the grounds of a parental complaint that it was unsuitable for children due to profanity and anti-Catholic messages; teachers complained about Fauss's decision as he overrode school board decisions at Stanislaus County Office of Education and Modesto City Schools that both came up with the conclusion to keep the book within the curriculum.Hatfield, Michelle. \\"Orestimba Book Ban Called 'Scary'.\\" Modesto Bee, The (CA). Access World News. NewsBank. Nov 23 2008. Web. 4 November 2016. The parents within the community were quiet on voicing any complaints. It came after a parent filed a complaint regarding Bless Me, Ultima, the novel was withdrawn from the classroom, which affected the 200 students of whom were expected to read it over the course of the year. However, the policy's responsibility was then handed over to the school board of Newman-Crows Landing Unified School District after Fauss stayed with his ban even after two panel decisions made up of educators within the district and outside the district.Sly, Judy. \\"School Board should Decide if 'Ultima' Deserves Banning.\\" Modesto Bee, The (CA). Access World News. NewsBank, Inc. Dec 01 2008. Web. 4 November 2016. The final decision would be brought to the school board. The parent who made the original complaint argued that the text used explicit wording and anti-Catholic views ‚Äúthat undermine the conservative family values in our homes.‚Äù However, one attendee of the special meeting noted in favor of the book that \\"I can't think of a book, I can't think of a newspaper article that's not offensive to some people.\\" The policy's responsibility after the superintendent was then handed over to the school board of Newman-Crows Landing Unified School District. Ultimately, the board trustees voted 4-1 to remove Bless Me, Ultima from the curriculum however the novel will continue to remain in the library based on the grounds of the previous complaint made.Hatfield, Michelle. \\"Board Upholds Novel's Removal - 'Bless Me, Ultima' Won't be Taught at Orestimba High School by 4-1 Vote.\\" Modesto Bee, The (CA). Access World News. NewsBank, Inc. Feb 03 2009. Web. 4 November 2016. = Opinions on censorship = Linda Varvel is an English teacher who used Bless Me, Ultima for her students.Varvel, Linda. \\"Censorship and Bless Me, Ultima: A Journey through Fear to Understanding.\\" Censored Books II. Ed. Nicholas J. Karolides. Lanham: Scarecrow, 2002. 70-79. Literature Resource Center; Gale.Web. Her essay on the censorship and the provoking aspects of the novel provide an opinion on why the novel caused issues within various school districts. She believes the novel should stay as a beneficial source of education to students. The book may utilize a critical lens of Catholicism, the overall theme of a child coming to terms with the world around him and forming opinions is a valuable story for all children and parents: \\"The deeper message is one that many readers who would censor this novel must also believe: no one but God is all-powerful, and the mystery of life cannot be known entirely by human beings. This message might be the common ground to initiate any discussion around this kind of censorship challenge\\". In reviewing the above cases of censorship where a group or individual challenges and/or ends up censoring this book, the reasoning is that the themes of anti-Catholic values, sex, excessive violence, adult language, and/or others are problematic for the values children of a community should have. =Adaptations= Theatrical adaptations On April 10 and 12, 2008, in partnership with The National Endowment for the Arts' Big Read, Roberto Cant√∫, professor of Chicano Studies and English, who is intimately familiar with Bless Me, Ultima, produced a dramatic reading as a stage adaptation of the novel at Cal State L.A.

As Bradley  Bradley was laid down at San Francisco, California on 17 January 1963, launched on 26 March 1964, and commissioned on 15 May 1965. Her first deployment to the Western Pacific between July and December 1966 included four months of gunfire support along the coast of South Vietnam and carrier escort duty in the Gulf of Tonkin. In February 1967 Bradley received the prototype destroyer installation of the Sea Sparrow Basic Point Defense Missile System (BPDMS). After intensive trials between May and September, the system was removed in September. Bradley commenced her second deployment to Southeast Asia in December 1967 but was diverted to the Sea of Japan in response to the North Korean capture of as part of Operation Formation Star. In March she resumed carrier escort and gunfire support duties off South Vietnam. After a final tour on the gun line in June, during which she fired 3,247 rounds in 10 days from her two 5-inch/38 guns, she returned to San Diego, California in July 1968. Her first regular overhaul between October 1968 and May 1969 featured a major upgrade to her AN/SQS 26AXR sonar and extensive work on her two temperamental pressure-fired boilers. Bradleys third deployment featured a gun line tour in January 1970, surveillance of the Soviet Navy's worldwide \\"Okean\\" exercise in April, and more carrier escort and gunfire support duty lasting into June. During the next five years Bradley conducted three additional deployments to Southeast Asia, interrupted by a second regular overhaul in 1971-72. In June 1975 Bradley began a year-long overhaul which included the enlargement of her helicopter hangar. In July 1975 she was reclassified from escort ship (DE) to frigate (FF). After trials in mid-1976, Bradley conducted two more deployments, each of which included lengthy operations in the Indian Ocean, before entering the shipyard in mid-1979 for another one-year overhaul. Repeating this pattern, she conducted another two deployments, this time ranging between Korea and Malaysia, before starting another year-long overhaul in mid-1983, primarily to remedy boiler problems. The ship made one more Western Pacific deployment between mid-1986 and January 1987 and a Northern Pacific cruise in May‚ÄìJune 1988 before decommissioning on 30 September 1988.

She was stricken from the U.S. Navy and sold outright to Brazil in January 2001. She remained active in the Brazilian Navy into her 39th year afloat, having participated at sea in seven exercises between early 2001 and early 2003. On 11 March 2004, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a medium-sized town in the Riverina region of New South Wales, Australia. The town's prosperity and mixed services economy is based on a combination of agriculture, rail transport, light industry and government services, and in particular correctional services. In 2015 Junee's urban population was 4,762. Place name One theory is that word Junee which originates from the Aboriginal word 'Junee' means \\"speak to me\\". Another theory is that it is an Aboriginal word \\"Choo-nee\\" meaning \\"frog\\". History The Wiradjuri people are the traditional owners of the local area prior to European settlement. Leopold de Salis (1816-1898), pastoralist and later politician was one of the first squatters to open up the Riverina region to grazing.Sutherland J (1999), A Short History of the Riverina Wheat Industry, New South Wales Heritage Office He established the 'Junee' pastoral run in 1845. Leopold held the licence for this run for a total of three years. Other run licencees followed until Thomas Hammond and Richard Gwynne bought the licence in 1857. The Junee run progressively reduced in area as selectors took up land but Hammond lived on it until his death in 1899, the remaining property having been named \\"Wyoming\\" in 1887. A post office opened in 1862 and a village called 'Junee' was gazetted in 1863 on the wool road to Sydney. That same year, Ben Hall and his bushranging gang raided the village. Culture and History Junee railway station with a CountryLink XPT at the platform In 1866 Junee's population was recorded as twelve but the discovery of reef and alluvial gold during the 1860s triggered a gold rush. The main sites- Junee Reefs (to the north), was mined on and off until after World War 1, as well as Wantiool and Eurongilly (to the east) until the 1880s. By 1878 with the southward expansion of the Main South line in New South Wales, the main railway line between Sydney and Melbourne passed 8 kilometres east of the Village. Junee's Post Office was renamed Old Junee in 1885 (Junee railway station). Loftus was the original name of the locality being farm land and as the settlers moved in for the rail line it was renamed. Junee Railway Station Post Office opened on 6 July 1878, was renamed Junee Junction in 1881 and later still, Junee in 1893. =Rail and road= The Main South line between Sydney and Melbourne runs through Junee, as does the Olympic Highway, named for the route of the 1956 Summer Olympics Torch Relay. The advent of rail transport in 1878 provided the impetus for an economic boom providing local agricultural producers with affordable direct access to markets in Sydney. In 1952 the largest wheat terminal in the Southern Hemisphere was constructed at Junee, adjacent to the South West Railway, providing for both rail and road transport. =Local Government= On 1 January 1981, Junee Municipal Council amalgamated with the surrounding \\"Illabo Shire Council', creating Junee Shire Council. Junee visitors and residents are served by NSW TrainLink XPT services on their way between Melbourne and Sydney. The local Council maintains an online tourism map including local places of interest. Rail transport makes an important contribution to the local economy with Regional Rail Logistics operating a containerised freight service that delivers various goods from Junee to Sydney, with interstate freight trains also passing through the town.

The Battle of Natural Bridge was fought during the American Civil War in what is now Woodville, Florida near Tallahassee on March 6, 1865. As people in Tallahassee tell the story, handed down since the civil war, a small band of Confederate troops and volunteers, mostly composed of teenagers from the nearby Florida Military and Collegiate Institute that would later become Florida State University, and the elderly, protected by breastworks, prevented a detachment of United States Colored Troops from crossing the Natural Bridge on the St. Marks River. The Natural Bridge is a stretch along which the St. Marks River runs underground, after dropping into a sinkhole. Battle The Union's Brig. Gen. John Newton had undertaken a joint force expedition to engage and destroy Confederate troops that had attacked at Cedar Keys, Florida and Fort Myers and were allegedly encamped somewhere around St. Marks. The Union Navy had trouble getting its ships up the St. Marks River. The Union Army force, however, had advanced and, after finding one bridge destroyed, started before dawn on March 6 to attempt to cross the river at Natural Bridge. The Union troops initially pushed Rebel forces back, but not away from the bridge. Sailors from USS Hendrick Hudson also participated, and two were awarded the Medal of Honor for their part in this battle: Seaman John Mack and Coxswain George Schutt. Confederate forces under Brigade General William Miller, protected by breastworks, guarded all of the approaches and the bridge itself. The action at Natural Bridge lasted most of the day, but, unable to take the bridge in three separate charges, the Union troops retreated to the protection of the fleet. Based on the involvement of the students from the Florida Military and Collegiate Institute, the Florida State University Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program is one of only four Army ROTC programs to have a battle streamer for their actions in the Civil War.The other three programs are: the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) for the Battle of New Market, The Citadel, for the defense of Charleston and 7 other engagements, and The University of Mississippi for the defense of Vicksburg. Since it was originally part of the Army, FSU's Air Force ROTC unit also displays the same battle streamer. Monument The site of the battle is now Natural Bridge Battlefield State Historic Site, a Florida State Park, and contains a monument with the inscription: Annual Memorial Service and Battle Reenactment First reenactment of the battle in 1974 A ceremony honoring the combatants on both sides of the Battle of Natural Bridge, followed by a reenactment of the battle featuring Union, Confederate, and civilian reenactors, is held at the park the first weekend of March every year.

Howell, portrayed by veteran character actor Jim Backus, is so wealthy that he took hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and several changes of clothing with him for what was intended to be only a three-hour boat tour in Hawaii, one of the sillier premises of the show. Speaking with a Locust Valley lockjaw accent, Howell is a stereotypical member of the New England Yankee elite ‚Äî a resident of Newport, Rhode Island, a graduate of Harvard University and a Republican. He is a member of the Newport Country Club, Oyster Bay Yacht Club, and the Union League Club where he has a \\"window seat\\". His wife, Lovey, portrayed by Natalie Schafer, is conscious of social strata, yet seems to be a good-hearted woman with a deep sense of noblesse oblige, allowing her to interact with the other passengers and crew, though they are all her social inferiors. One of the implied humorous points of the show is that Thurston continually fails to realize that all of the Howells' money is essentially useless to them on the island. On the other hand, the other castaways apparently tolerate the fact that he refuses to do any work. One exception is when an egocentric Hollywood producer (played by Phil Silvers) \\"visited\\" the island and the Howells had to wait on him as butler and maid in order to be rescued. One of the most unusual aspects of his character is that, even though he is married, he sleeps with a teddy bear that he calls \\"Teddy\\". The Howells, as was common practice on American sitcoms of the mid-1960s, slept in twin beds. Thurston Howell III was the basis of a character in the television sitcom Dusty's Trail which was based on Gilligan's Island. Though described as a cunning, ruthless businessman, whose nickname was \\"The wolf of Wall St.\\", he's shown to have some moral scruples-when a mad scientist lures the castaways to his private island and shows Mr. Howell technology he'd developed to switch peoples bodies, he then asks for Mr. Howells help in switching the bodies of world leaders with his personal minions to take over the world. Mr. Howell instead turns him down and tells his fellow castaways about the scientist‚Äôs intentions. Howell was included on Forbes Magazine's 2006 list of the 15 richest fictional characters. Just how much money he had was never specified, but he was shown as owning several large corporations. When asked what happened to him during the Great Depression, his wife says that he was a billionaire, lost most of his money and \\"became just a millionaire.\\" Among his assets were a diamond mine, a coconut plantation, a railroad, an oil well, and in Colorado‚Äîwhich included all of downtown Denver‚Äîthat he bequeathed to his fellow castaways in his will. He also owned the Hatchet-Cuckoo Oil Company in Dust Bowl, Oklahoma. He tried to shove this supposedly worthless oil company on Gilligan. When he hears that an imposter is going to sell off his companies for cash, he is so enraged that he tries to swim back to the mainland three times, intent on killing the man, only to be stopped by Gilligan, the Skipper and his wife. Backus reprised his role in the three spin-off movies of the original series, although in the last one (The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island) Backus's declining health only allowed him to make a three-minute appearance. Although the Howells never had any children in the original series, their son Thurston Howell IV (portrayed by David Ruprecht) is introduced in the last movie. The younger Howell's mannerisms are similar to those of his father.

In the series, it is a prototype weapon for the Earth Federation when it falls into the hands of Amuro Ray, the son of its designer in story (Tem Ray), who goes on to pilot it in the Earth Federation's war against the Principality of Zeon. As the success of the series began the Gundam franchise, the robot's design was the first of many variations in subsequent works. The design appearing in Mobile Suit Gundam serves as the iconic symbol of the Gundam franchise and sparked the creation of its multiple sequels and spinoffs. Character design The RX-78's initial concept was that of a powered armor, the primary design for Yoshiyuki Tomino's proposed series Freedom Fighter Gunboy. The series later changed its name to Mobile Suit Gundam and Kunio Okawara was given Tomino's concept to shape into a finalized design for the anime. Okawara created multiple designs before settling on the current, samurai-styled design for the anime in 1979. Enemies in the series keep referring to the RX-78-2 as the white suit or the White Devil (due to the suit's formidable battle performance) while it is a mix of blue, red, and white. Tomino's response in the novel version of Gundam is that the original design was to be a grayscale machine, made up of mostly white and light gray colouring. However, Sunrise disapproved of the colouring and insisted the unit to be painted in brighter colours to attract attention, like other super robot anime at that time.Mobile Suit Gundam(novel), October 1987, The \\"original\\" Gundam, the RX-78-2 design was to be the second unit in a line of eight prototype high-performance assault-type mobile suits.Gundam Officials, Gundam entry and Earth Federation Mobile Suit listing. The preceding Gundam model RX-78-1 and the subsequent model RX-78-3 were designed by Okawara between 1980 and 1983 for Gundam CenturyGundam Century renewal version, Kishosha, March 15, 2000, and Mobile Suit VariationsMobile Suit Variation and the latter appeared in the novel version as the G-3 Gundam after the original Unit 2 was destroyed in battle. The fourth to seventh Gundam is designed by Okawara in 1989 for Kunio Okawara collection, also known as M-MSV(Missing Mobile Suit Variation).Â§ßÊ≤≥ÂéüÈÇ¶Áî∑„Ç≥„É¨„ÇØ„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ Other mechanical designers later added further design variations; including Yutaka Izubuchi's RX-78NT-1, designed in 1989 for the OVA series Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket, and Shoji Kawamori's and Hajime Katoki's Gundam Development Project designs in 1992 for Gundam 0083. The RX-78-2 has also been redesigned several times by other artists. In particular, Hajime Katoki's version of the Gundam (referred to as Ver. Ka) has become popular enough to be made into both injection plastic model kits sold by Bandai and resin-based garage kits sold by their B-Club subsidiary. Okawara himself redesigned the Gundam for original character designer Yoshikazu Yasuhiko's manga Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin, a retelling of the events of the original series. Though mostly identical to the original, it features slightly different designs for its weapons, a small Vulcan pod in its shoulder, and the ability to replace one of the beam sabers stored in its backpack with a cannon similar to that of the RX-77 Guncannon. In addition, the 15th installment of the Gundam Evolve series of shorts features another variation on the RX-78's design, a highly stylized version of the iconic machine based on \\"modern\\" design aesthetics. It has been referred as Ver. Evolve 15.Evolve Material, Gundam Evolve official guide book. The continuing popularity in Japan of this mobile suit has led Bandai to create a 1.5m tall model version, which went on sale in Japan in 2007. The Japan Self-Defense Forces built an approximately full scale RX-78-3 Gundam with styrofoam in its show and contains a simulation pod. Gundam Expo (Hong Kong) uses the RX-78-2's last shooting scene in its logo's X. In the Super Robot Wars series of tactical role-playing games, the Gundam franchise is the chief representative of the \\"Real Robot\\" genre and one of the three mainstays of the series (the other two being Mazinger and Getter Robo), and the original Gundam itself is referred to in the series as the in order to distinguish it from its many successors.Super Robot Wars data file, Gamestation June 2000 2nd issue SRW alpha special Role in plot The deployment of the Principality of Zeon's highly agile mobile suits, the MS-05 Zaku I and the MS-06 Zaku II, in the early phase of the One Year War had given the small nation a major tactical edge over the much larger Earth Federation. Due to the widespread use of the Minovsky particles, which interfered with radio transmissions and rendered beyond-visual-range missiles useless, space warfare was reduced to direct fire barrages between large starships and spacefighterdogfights. The Zakus, capable of propellant-less maneuvering thanks to their AMBAC systems and able to be retrofitted to suit a variety of missions and environments, easily outclassed the Federation's arsenal of conventional space fighters and laid waste to the Federation armada of dreadnought space warships. Realizing that the gap needed to be closed, the Federation instituted Project V (short for \\"Project Victory\\"), a development program that would produce a counterpart Federation mobile suit design, with the capability for mass-production a mandatory requirement. While the ultimate result of the program was the mass-produced RGM-79 GM series, the high- performance RX-78 series prototypes served as the main testbed for the Project V engineers to trial several new design concepts that proved profoundly influential for the coming decades. Some of the developments in the RX-78 models were later incorporated into the GM line, but many were scrapped due to cost and/or complexity. Only eight RX-78 suits were produced during the One Year War, although continual remodelling and upgrading created the impression that there were more than eight units. Although the RX-78 suits are designated RX-78-1 to RX-78-8, the final digit indicated the design version of the unit, rather than its actual number. In addition, the Earth Federation Forces started a G-4 project which consist of four RX-78s for each of its branches, and EFSF (Earth Federation Space Force) used information of the RX-78-4 to develop the RX-78NT-1. According to the director's production notes of Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket, it could be considered to be the 9th unit of RX-78, initially intended to be used by Amuro Ray. Although what unit the EFAF (EF Air Force) developed is not specifically mentioned, in the semi-canon manga Mobile Suit Gundam: MS Generation the EFAF created the RX-78E (GT FOUR/Gundam Transformer/Flight & Operations Unifications Reactors), which is different from the eight RX-78s produced. Another unit is the EFGF's (EF Ground Force) RX-78XX, which uses scrap parts of the RX-78s, just like the RX-79[G] Gundam Ground Combat Type. The EFN (EF Navy) developed the RAG-79-G1 as the G-4 project's marine type Gundam, yet it is only an upgrade of the RAG-79 Aqua GM for Ace pilots with just the head and generator changed. After the One Year War, the GP series are numbered after the RX-78 convention, despite being newly produced units. The variation among the Gundams was originally indicated by differences in colouration, indicating upgrades to completely internal equipment and technology, although later variants displayed externally visible upgrades. For example, Unit 4 and Unit 5, which exist mainly in games and as model kits, provide additional mounting points and weaponry. The RX-78 series introduced Minovsky particle beam weaponry to mobile suits, developing and deploying the first successful beam rifle and beam saber. These would form the primary component of mobile suit weaponry for at least the next hundred and fifty years. The core block system was also introduced in the RX-78, as well as the RX-75 Guntank and RX-77 Guncannon. This system allowed the pilot to escape the destruction of his mobile suit in a functional aerospace fighter, as well as housing a learning computer that can collect and analyze performance data from the suit's combat sorties and self-adapt for improvement. This however had to be dropped from subsequent mass-production units due to cost issues. However, it was reused on occasion (most notably in the Anaheim Electronics MSZ-010 ZZ Gundam during the First Neo Zeon War), and later resurrected in UC 0153 by the League Militaire on the LM312V04 Victory Gundam. After the end of the One Year War, the Federation opened up a black op mobile suit development program, the Gundam Development Project, in order to develop mobile suits to fill roles that had appeared in analysis of combat operations from the One Year War. After the events of Gundam 0083, all details of the Gundam Development Project were erased from the official records. The RX-78 line was finally superseded in UC 0087 by the RX-178 Gundam Mk-II, developed by the Titans counterinsurgency taskforce. Notable variations RX-78NT-1 Gundam NT-1 \\"Alex\\" =RX-78NT-1 Gundam NT-1 \\"Alex\\"= Primary Mobile Suit featured in the 1989 OVA Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket, designed by Yutaka Izubuchi. The first direct variant of the RX-78 to be animated, it helped pave the way for the appearance of other variants, such as those from Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory, as pivotal elements of the plot. In War in the Pocket, the Alex was developed to replace the RX-78-2 and optimized for the increased reaction time of Newtypes, though its test pilot Christina MacKenzie was not a Newtype herself. With its panoramic cockpit, the Alex serves as a retconned technological link between the original series and Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam. Offensively, the Alex sports large multi-barreled cannons concealed beneath the blue pods on either arm in addition to a pair of small Vulcan guns mounted on the head and the ubiquitous backpack-stored beam sabers. It was also to be equipped with a beam rifle and shield, but they were not completed by the time the Alex was ready. The Alex could be outfitted with a Chobham armour shell that offered extra protection. Its data would be used for the GM Custom. The Chobham armour design would be used to reinforce the body of the GM Cannon II. Both of these later GM's appear in Gundam 0083, further bridging the gap between the original series and Zeta Gundam. The Alex only sortied twice, and was severely damaged days before the One Year War ended. Media =Pop culture= The appearance of the unit is not limited to Gundam series. RX-78-2 Gundam is one of the basic units that appear in the Super Robot Wars series, ever since the first game for the Game Boy. The RX-78-2 also makes multiple cameo appearances in the anime Sgt. Frog. The current Bandai Universal Century models' label copyright classification also uses the head of the Gundam as its icon.Warera!

In 2008, an ink and wash painting of Gundam drawn by Hisashi (Â§©ÊòéÂ±ã Â∞ö) in 2005 was sold in the Christie's auction held in Hong Kong with a price of $600,000 (USD). An 18-meter life-size version of the Gundam was built in 2009 to commemorate the franchise's 30 year anniversary. The project is in response to the 30th Anniversary of Gundam as well as a fund raising project for Green Tokyo, a project preparing Tokyo in terms of the bid for 2016 Olympic Games with the theme of a Green Olympic. The statue itself is depicted in the 2010 anime Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. After an appearance at Bandai's headquarters in Shizuoka from late 2010 to March 2011, it was erected again at the new Gundam Front Tokyo theme attraction on Odaiba, opening on July 2012 until March 2013. On July 16, 2010, ANA launched a series of flights as part of the 30th anniversary of Gunpla. Called the \\"ANA x GUNDAM Sky Project,\\" the promotion used specially painted Boeing 777s on domestic and international flights. The initial flight was from Tokyo to Osaka. Passengers were also given the chance to buy HGUC 1/144 and 1/48 MegaScale kits of the RX-78-2 Gundam painted in ANA colors aboard the flight. It was scheduled to end in March 2011, but was extended to June 30, 2011. The promotion was expanded to offer special 1/144 versions of the 00 Raiser and the Gundam Unicorn. The RX-78-2 Gundam appeared in Steven Spielberg's film Ready Player One (2018), where one of the protagonists controls a full size Gundam replica during the climatic battle in a virtual reality environment, where it, and its ally The Iron Giant is used to battle the antagonist's Mechagodzilla. The Gundam was featured on the online series Death Battle and was pitted up against the Autobot leader Optimus Prime and lost due to the Autobot being more skilled, having far superior feats and better weapons.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fyh2iO0rCh4 =Statues= As part of the 30th Anniversary of the Gundam series, the company officially announced a project on March 11, 2009 called Real-G planning to build a 1:1 real size scale Gundam in Japan. It was completed on June 9, 2009 and displayed in a Tokyo park. The 18-meter tall statue was later moved and reconstructed in Shizuoka City, where it stayed from July 2010 to March 2011. In August it was dismantled and reconstructed in Odaiba, Tokyo on April 19, 2012. Until March 5, 2017 it stood in Odaiba along with a gift shop called \\"Gundam Front Tokyo\\". On March 5, it was announced that the life size RX 78-2 Gundam will be replaced by another life size statue of the RX 0 Unicorn Gundam from Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. =Theme park attraction \\"Gundam Crisis\\" and \\"Gundam Front Tokyo\\"= The RX-78-2 Gundam had a full 1:1 scale mock-up constructed for the theme park attraction Gundam Crisis. It costs 800 yen to go into the attraction and the attraction is basically a game where the players have to complete about eight different missions within 8 minutes (1 minute per mission) in order to access the cockpit. If successful, players are shown a special, Gundam-related video inside the cockpit.Warera!

Later editions of a book sometimes have a new foreword prepended (appearing before an older foreword if there was one), which might explain in what respects that edition differs from previous ones. When written by the author, the foreword may cover the story of how the book came into being or how the idea for the book was developed, and may include thanks and acknowledgments to people who were helpful to the author during the time of writing. Unlike a preface, a foreword is always signed. Information essential to the main text is generally placed in a set of explanatory notes, or perhaps in an introduction, rather than in the foreword or like preface. The pages containing the foreword and preface (and other front matter) are typically not numbered as part of the main work, which usually uses Arabic numerals. If the front matter is paginated, it uses lowercase Roman numerals. If there is both a foreword and a preface, the foreword appears first; both appear before the introduction, which may be paginated either with the front matter or the main text.

In humans, PMDS typically is due to an autosomal recessive congenital disorder and is considered by some to be a form of pseudohermaphroditism due to the presence of M√ºllerian derivatives. Typical features include undescended testes (cryptorchidism) and the presence of a small, underdeveloped uterus in an XY infant or adult. This condition is usually caused by deficiency of fetal anti-M√ºllerian hormone (AMH) effect due to mutations of the gene for AMH or the anti-M√ºllerian hormone receptor, but may also be as a result of insensitivity to AMH of the target organ.  Symptoms  The first visible signs of PMDS after birth is Cryptorchidism (undescended testes) either unilaterally or bilaterally. Along with Cryptorchidism, is also inguinal hernias which may be presented unilaterally (affects one testicle) or bilaterally (affects both testicles). Adults who have been oblivious to this condition may be presented with haematuria, which is when blood appears in urine because of hormonal imbalances. PMDS Type I, is also referred to as ‚ÄòHernia Uteri Inguinalis‚Äô, which exhibits one descended testis that has also pulled the fallopian tube and sometimes uterus, through the inguinal canal. The descended testes, fallopian tube and uterus all fall in the same inguinal canal, causing an inguinal hernia. Altogether when the aforementioned conditions occur, it is called ‚ÄòTransverse Testicular Ectopia‚Äô. Under the microscope, some samples taken for biopsies displayed results where testicular tissue was at a stage of immaturity, and showed dysplasia. Molecular genetics  Mutation in AMH gene (PMDS Type 1) or AMHR2 gene (PMDS Type 2) are the primary causes of PMDS. AMH, or sometimes referred to as M√ºllerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS), is secreted by Sertoli cells during an individual's whole life. It is essential during the foetal period as it functions to regress the M√ºllerian ducts. However, AMH also functions in the last trimester of pregnancy, after birth, and even during adulthood in minimal amounts. The Sertoli cells in males secrete AMH, through the presence of a Y chromosome. The role of the AMH gene in reproductive development, is the production of a protein that contributes to male sex differentiation. During development of male foetuses, the AMH protein is secreted by cells within the testes. AMHs bind to the AMH Type 2 Receptors, which is present on cells on the surface of the M√ºllerian Duct. The binding of AMH to its receptors on the M√ºllerian duct induces the apoptosis of the M√ºllerian Duct cells, thus the regression of the M√ºllerian Duct within males. However, for females who originally do not produce AMH proteins during foetal development, the M√ºllerian Duct eventually becomes the uterus and fallopian Tubes as normal. With the AMH gene mutation (PMDS Type 1), the AMH is either not produced, produced in deficient amounts, defective, secreted at the wrong critical period for male differentiation or the M√ºllerian ducts manifested a resistance to AMH. AMHR2 contains the instructions for generating the receptors that AMH binds to. If there if a mutation in the AMHR2 gene, the response to AMH molecules binding to the receptor cannot be properly reciprocated. Other possibilities include an absence of the receptors, such that the AMH molecules cannot induce differentiation. Mutation in the AMHR2 is critical to proper male sex differentiation. The genetic mutational cause of PMDS, is a 27 base- pair deletion of the Anti-Mullerian Type 2 Receptor gene. The 27-base-pair deletion that occurs PMDS is in exon 10 on one allele. PMDS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The male individuals inherit mutated copies of the X-chromosomes from the maternal and paternal genes, implying the parents are carriers and do not show symptoms. Females inheriting two mutated genes do not display symptoms of PMDS, though remain as carriers. Males are affected genotypically with the karyotype (46, XY) and phenotypically. Diagnosis Persistent M√ºllerian Duct Syndrome (PMDS), also known as Persistent Oviduct Syndrome, is a congenital disorder related to male sexual development. PMDS usually affects phenotypically normal male individuals with the karyotype (46, XY) and is a form of pseudohermaphroditism. PMDS has various causes to do with AMH or receptors abnormalities. For example, AMH has failed to synthesis, failed to release or was secreted at the wrong time. The condition develops in males that consist of normal functioning reproductive organs and gonads, but also female reproductive organs such as the uterus and fallopian tubes. The female reproductive organs origin from a structure from when both genders are still foetuses, called the ‚ÄúMullerian Duct‚Äù. In males, the secretion of ‚ÄòAnti- Mullerian Hormone (AMH)‚Äô causes the regression of the M√ºllerian Duct. Normally, both the Mullerian and Wolffian ducts are present during the 7th week of gestation. Approximately by the end of the 7th and beginning of the 8th week of gestation, the Sertoli cell's secretion of AMH occur, causing the male sex differentiation during foetal development. The AMH molecules bind to AMHRII (Anti-Mullerian Hormone Receptor Type II) regressing the M√ºllerian duct. The Leydig cells secrete testosterone to aid male differentiation process by inducing structures such as the epididymis, vas deferens and seminal vesicles. However, with PMDS individuals, the M√ºllerian Duct persists instead of regressing, due to errors with AMH or the AMH receptor. The problem either coincides with the secretion of AMH (PMDS Type I) or the receptor (PMDS Type II). PMDS is usually coincidentally found during surgery for inguinal hernia, or when the surgeon looks for the reason why the male individual is infertile in adulthood. = Other diagnostic tests =  Genetic  Another method for the confirmation of PMDS is Genetic Testing. It is not usually preferred because of its processing period and cost. With image screenings such as ultrasounds and MRI, the condition can be efficiently confirmed. Genetic tests can identify those who hold the mutated gene, identify the family member's chances and risks, and advise those who are trying to get pregnant. Genetic counselling and further genetic testing is offered to confirm the chances and risks of an individual's offspring obtaining the pair of mutated genes. Further research into the family tree and inheritance is possible as well.  ELISA  An ELISA test is a form of immunoassaying which is a technique consisting of enzymes to identify the presence of particular substances. For PMDS, ELISA tests can be used to determine the levels of AMH within the male individual's serum, this is only effective before the individual reaches puberty as it normally increases in this period. The result for PMDS patients display low levels of AMH within the serum, and low levels of testosterone. Mechanism AMH (Anti M√ºllerian Hormone) is produced by the primitive Sertoli cells as one of the earliest Sertoli cell products and induces regression of the M√ºllerian ducts. Fetal M√ºllerian ducts are only sensitive to AMH action around the 7th or 8th week of gestation, and M√ºllerian regression is completed by the end of the 9th week. The AMH induced regression of the M√ºllerian duct occurs in cranio-caudal direction via apoptosis. The AMH receptors are on the M√ºllerian duct mesenchyme and transfer the apoptotic signal to the M√ºllerian epithelial cell, presumably via paracrine actors. The Wolffian ducts differentiate into epididymides, vasa deferentia and seminal vesicles under the influence of testosterone, produced by the fetal Leydig cells. Treatment The main form of treatment is laparotomy, a modern and minimally invasive type of surgery. Laparotomy properly positions the testes within the scrotum (orchidopexy) and remove Mullerian structures being the uterus and fallopian tubes. Occasionally they are unsalvageable if located high in the retroperitoneum. During this surgery, the uterus is usually removed and attempts made to dissect away M√ºllerian tissue from the vas deferens and epididymis to improve the chance of fertility. If the person has male gender identity himself and the testes cannot be retrieved, testosterone replacement will be usually necessary at puberty should the affected individual choose to pursue medical attention. Lately, laparoscopic hysterectomy is offered to patients as a solution to both improve the chances of fertility and to prevent the occurrences of neoplastic tissue formation. The surgery is recommended to be performed when the individual is between one and two years old, but usually done when less than one years old. Having a target age for surgery reduces the risks of damaging the vas deferens. The vas deferens is in close proximity to the Mullerian structures, sometimes lodged in the uterine wall. Overall, the purpose of the treatment improves self-identification of an individual, hopefully prevent the increased risk of cancer, and to prevent possibilities of infertility if not already. PMDS patients have the possibility of being infertile in the future if not promptly operated on. When the affected males are adults, those who are not attentive of the condition may find the presence of blood in their semen (hematospermia). The Mullerian structures and cryptorchidism also can develop into cancer if ignored, or if there are remaining pieces of Mullerian structures left from past surgery. If PMDS was found during adulthood, or if Mullerian structures had to be left behind due to risks in surgery, biopsies of the remaining Mullerian structures can be tested. Through pathohistological observation, the endometrial tissues atrophy, and fallopian tubes begin to congest showing signs of fibrosis.  Epidemiology  PMDS it a relatively rare congenital disease. From current data, approximately 45% of the known cases are caused by mutations in the AMH gene, being a mutation on chromosome 19 (Type I PMDS). Approximately, 40% of the known cases are AMHR2 mutations, on the AMH Receptor Type 2 gene, which is on chromosome 12 (Type 2 PMDS). The remaining unknown 15% are referred to as ‚ÄòIdiopathic PMDS‚Äô.  Case Studies  PMDS is usually overseen because of the external symptoms such as the cryptorchidism and inguinal hernias, being assumed to be the only complication. Especially before the 21st century, these conditions were hard to diagnose due differences in imaging capabilities to the present. For this reason, there are cases where the older population, or those in poorer countries find out later. A case reported in 2013, exhibits a 50-year-old male with history of low testosterone levels, high cholesterol and the congenital absence of his right testis. Imaging presented the patient with three cystic masses, with similar structures to a uterus and ovary, thus PMDS. During operation, the surgeons found malignant degeneration of the Mullerian remnants which occurs to the body if PMDS is unnoticed for a long period of time. The cause of the complication presented to the male patient is due mainly to the unidentified bilateral cryptorchidism since birth, as doctors at that time assumed the complication was just the ‚Äúcongenital absence of his right testis‚Äù. Overlooking the symptoms of PDMS can cause permanent negative effects such as infertility and future malignancies as shown by the male patient. The malignant degeneration of the Mullerian structures is supportive evidence for the male patient's infertility.

History The painting was created as a traveling attraction for Northerners; it portrayed celebrated Union officers, while the portrayals of Confederate officers were not individualized. It was purchased and moved to Atlanta in 1891 by Paul Atkinson, who attempted to recast the Battle of Atlanta as a Confederate victory, repainting a group of Confederate prisoners of war so they became defeated Union soldiers. Paying visitors viewed the cylindrical painting from the inside, entering through an entrance in the floor. After being seated, the central cylinder rotates slowly, affording a view of the entire painting. The painting at one time was the largest oil painting in the world, and if unrolled would measure high by long. It held this record until 1894, when it was surpassed in size by The Rac≈Çawice Panorama (15 √ó 114 meter, 49 ft √ó 374 ft) a cycloramic painting depicting the Battle of Rac≈Çawice. The Cyclorama was narrated at one time by volunteers, some of whom were veterans or widows of veterans of the Civil War. In 1960, Atlanta Mayor William B. Hartsfield accepted the donation of a recorded narration written by Junius Andrew Park, Jr., in honor of his father, Junius Andrew Park, Sr., who was born and raised in Atlanta. Research was done by Lurline Richardson Park, the writer's wife. The narration was musically scored by Atlanta musician Sam T. Wilhoit, and the narration was read by Hollywood actor Victor Jory, who appeared in the original motion picture Gone with the Wind. All parties donated their time and labor. In later years, a revised narration was produced and narrated by actor Shepperd Strudwick. Civil War museum The uniform of a Confederate general The museum displayed pictures and artifacts from the Civil War, including the Texas, a steam locomotive that pursued the captured train the General in the Great Locomotive Chase during the war. This raid was depicted in the 1927 Buster Keaton film The General and the 1956 Disney film The Great Locomotive Chase. A movie theater inside the museum showed a short film about the Atlanta Campaign, narrated by James Earl Jones, to visitors before they view the painting. The cyclorama painting itself is augmented by a three-dimensional diorama in front of the painting and a narration of the events of the battle and the history of the painting. A popular story concerning the diorama involves actor Clark Gable. During the celebrations surrounding the opening of the film Gone with the Wind, the film's actors visited the Atlanta Cyclorama. Gable allegedly claimed that the only way the painting could be any more magnificent was if he were in it, prompting the management to add Gable's features to one of the sculptures in the diorama, that of a dying soldier. Relocation In July 2014, Atlanta city officials announced plans to relocate the Cyclorama to the Atlanta History Center in Buckhead. The possibility of a move started soon after the 2008 restoration of the only other panoramic painting in the United States, the Gettysburg Cyclorama. In 2011, a panel of city leaders and historians was appointed to investigate options for restoring and possibly relocating the painting, which was estimated to cost at least $8 million to restore. Three options were considered: relocate to Centennial Olympic Park area, near the Georgia Aquarium and other new tourist attractions; relocate to Atlanta History Center; or, remain in current location. The Atlanta History Center was selected after a local couple offered $10 million towards the project, with the History Center noting in its announcement that it had already raised $32.2 million for the move. The Cyclorama's final day open to the public was June 30, 2015, after which it closed in preparation for the move. The History Center began construction in fall 2015 on a new building to house the painting, the diorama and the Texas locomotive. During the construction, restoration work was done on the painting, including the addition of areas of the painting that were removed prior to its installation in the current Grant Park facility. After the History Center building was completed, the painting and diorama were to be moved to the new facility where restoration continued, at times in view of History Center visitors. The building in Grant Park will be given to Zoo Atlanta, which will use it as office and event space, including a new private viewing area for a proposed expansion of the zoo's African elephant habitat. The cost of relocation, $35.78 million, was raised, a figure that includes a $10 million endowment. The restored cyclorama reopened in April 2019.

There is also a famous dessert restaurant called Honeymoon Dessert that brings in many visitors from all over Hong Kong and even from abroad. In the northern Sai Kung Peninsula, there is also an area called Wong Shek. There are places where people can barbecue and enjoy the view of the sea. However, to protect the natural environment of Wong Shek, the Government controls the number of vehicle entering the area. There is a gate at Pak Tam Chung on the way towards Wong Shek, only allowing vehicles with permits to go through. Off the coast of the Sai Kung Peninsula, there are many outlying islands. On summer nights, many people hire small boats known as kai-tos or sampans to have leisurely trips through the island-dotted inland sea of Port Shelter. Popular islands to visit include: *Kau Sai Chau *Sharp Island (Kiu Tsui Chau) *High Island (Leung Shuen Wan Chau) *Pak Sha Chau (lit. white sand island) *Yeung Chau (lit. sheep island) *Yim Tin Tsai (lit. little salt field) Although Wong Shek and Hoi Ha Wan are geographically in the northern part of Sai Kung Peninsula, they are under the administration of Tai Po District, due to their reliance on ferry transport from Tai Po for access before the construction of roads. History From about the 14th century, fishing communities lived on boats in sheltered inlets on the peninsula. They later founded small coastal villages, building temples in honour of Tin Hau and Hung Shing in places of permanent anchorage. In addition to coastal fishing, there were small supporting industries of salt-making and boat building. Agricultural settlements began later and several villages already existed by the year 1660. Economic development began in the middle of the 19th century when Hong Kong was opened as a port. There was especially a prosperous kiln industry producing lime, bricks and tiles for supply Hong Kong during the early days. Sheung Yiu Village, once opened as a Folk Museum, was a good example of a fortified settlement well known for lime- making in those days. Until 1970, the part of Sai Kung beyond Tai Mong Tsai was still remote, reachable only on foot or by kai-tos (local ferry). However work started in 1971 to create the High Island Reservoir, with a capacity of , by closing off both ends of the Kwun Mun Channel which separated the High Island from the main peninsula. In 1979, the project was completed, providing also two new roads to the area. Since then, the city people can reach this relatively unspoilt area for recreation. Geology Hexagonal volcanic tuffs at Po Pin Chau, near the East Dam of High Island Reservoir. The Sai Kung Peninsula and the islands near the coast are composed almost entirely of volcanic materials. Coarse tuffs are found in the northern and south-western parts of the Peninsula and Tap Mun area. Pyroclastic rocks with some lava are found in the eastern part of the Sharp Peak and Sham Chung areas. Acid lavas are found in the area surrounding the High Island Reservoir and the south islands such as Kau Sai Chau, Tiu Chung Chau and Basalt Island, banded acid lava with some welded tuffs are found in the central and southern shore of Pak Tam Chung area. The most spectacular of all are the hexagonal columnar joints which are found near the east dam of the High Island Reservoir and Po Pin Chau area. They are the results of the uniform cooling of tuff. This natural landscape is complemented by the nearby gigantic water works. Along the south- eastern coast and on the offshore islands that are exposed to the easterly winds and sea waves, interesting landforms such as sea caves, stacks, arches and inlets add to the beauty of the natural landscape. Vegetation Grassland generally covers the hilltops, and across the Peninsula, there is an overall gradient from the grassland in the east to the woodland in the west. Grassland species are predominantly minireed, duck-beak grass and false staghorn fern. Shrubs cloth the lower slopes and species for Melastoma, Rhodomyrtus, Baeckea, Eurya and Gordonia are commonly found. Natural woodland, often in strips along the valleys or as patches behind villages are rich in native species of Machilus, Litsea, Sapium, Ficus, Sterculia and Schefflera. Forest plantations, the result of both direct government planting and government-assisted village planting in the 1950s cover the hillslopes, are mostly in the western part of the Peninsula. Chinese red pine was the most important species planted and many of these old pines are now approaching senility and suffer from nematode attack. Fortunately the under-storey native broad-leafed trees are growing up to take their place. The long and irregular coastline of the Peninsula also presents a wide variety of sea shore conditions for specialised and interesting plant communities to develop. Wildlife The grassy hillside of Sai Kung Peninsula have few birds. Around the picnic and barbecue sites, crested mynah and Eurasian tree sparrow may be seen feeding on scraps of left-over food. In patches of shrubs, Chinese bulbul can commonly be seen feeding on berries. In the densely wooded areas species such as greater coucal, great tit and white-eyed magpie nest. The old fung shui woods are particularly attractive to winter visitors such as thrushes which migrate to Hong Kong from China. Kingfishers can be found searching for food in streams. Most large wild animals are nocturnal and are rarely seen but porcupine, pangolin, masked palm civet, Chinese leopard cat, wild boar and python have been sighted in the area.

In Commonwealth jurisdictions where the governor is a vice-regal position, the role of \\"acting governor\\" may be filled by a lieutenant governor (as in most Australian states) or an administrator. In some U.S. states, it is a constitutional position created when the governor dies in office or resigns. In other states, the governor may also be declared to be incapacitated and unable to function for various reasons including illness and absence from the state for more than a specified period. In these instances, the state constitution will declare which official is to serve as governor and whether this person will have all of the powers of the office or only specified ones. In many states, the person succeeding to the governorship or becoming acting governor is the lieutenant governor; however, not all states have such a position. If the state constitution provides for an acting governor in the event of the governor's disability, it will also provide for a method by which the governor can be declared to be no longer disabled. Examples of acting governors =Alabama= George C. Wallace was shot in an assassination attempt in May of 1972. With him out of state recovering for more than 120 days, Lt. Governor Jere Beasley acted as governor from June 5 to July 7, 1972, at which time Governor Wallace returned to the state and returned to office. =Massachusetts= In Massachusetts, in the event of a vacancy in the governor's office, the lieutenant governor assumes the duties of the office, but not the office for the remainder of the term, thus becoming acting governor while retaining the lieutenant governor's office. In 1997, when William Weld resigned to pursue the ambassadorship to Mexico, Paul Cellucci took over as acting governor until after his 1998 election as governor, when he assumed office in January 1999. In 2001, when Cellucci resigned to become United States Ambassador to Canada, Jane Swift became the acting governor until January 2003, when Cellucci's term ended with the inauguration of Mitt Romney. =New Jersey= In New Jersey, a state which has a lieutenant governor, in the event of a vacancy in the office of governor, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. In case of the inability of the current governor to fulfill the gubernatorial duties through injury, the lieutenant governor serves as the acting governor. The acting governor performs powers and duties until the governor recovers from the injuries. If the governor's death or resignation occurs less than 16 months before end of the term, the new governor serves until the end of the term, otherwise a special election (in which the new governor may participate) is held. Prior to the establishment of the modern office of Lieutenant Governor following a constitutional referendum in 2005 that took effect in 2009, a vacancy in the office of governor would lead to the president of the state Senate to become acting governor while still retaining the title of senate president. Following the resignation of Christine Todd Whitman in 2001 to become EPA Administrator, Donald DiFrancesco assumed the acting governor's post, serving until January 2002. Following DiFrancesco's departure from the senate, John O. Bennett and Richard J. Codey each served as acting governor as well. As control of the New Jersey Senate was evenly split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett each held the office of acting governor for three days in January 2002, until Jim McGreevey began his term as governor. Codey again served as acting governor following McGreevey's own resignation, serving from November 2004 until January 2006, when Jon Corzine took office as governor. These unusual events were a major factor in voters' decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of lieutenant governor in the 2005 referendum, effective with the 2009 election. Before the amendment could take effect, state transportation commissioner Kris Kolluri served as acting governor the day of December 28, 2006. As Governor Corzine, the senate president, assembly speaker, and attorney general were all out of state, Kolluri became acting governor.\\"N.J. Gets New Governor... For a Day\\" , WPVI-TV, December 28, 2006. Accessed June 25, 2007. \\"Transportation Commissioner Kris Kolluri will take over the post because Governor Corzine will be out of town. So will the Senate president, Assembly speaker and attorney general, all of whom are ahead of Kolluri in the line of succession.\\" =West Virginia= In West Virginia, if the governorship becomes vacant, the Senate President acts as governor. If more than one year remains in the governor's term at the time of vacancy, a special election is held; otherwise, the Senate President serves the remainder of the term.WV Constitution article VII, ¬ß 16. A bill passed in 2000 grants the Senate President the honorary title of Lieutenant Governor, but this title is rarely used in practice and the terms of the Senate President do not correspond with governorships. Then-Senate President Earl Ray Tomblin is the first person under the current state Constitution to act as governor following the November 15, 2010 resignation of Joe Manchin following his election to the United States Senate seat vacated by the death of Robert Byrd. As there was more than one year remaining on Manchin's term as governor, a special election was held, which Tomblin won. He became governor on November 13, 2011 to complete the term. Disputes over powers of acting governors The powers of an acting governor came into dispute during the 1980 Democratic primary presidential campaign of Jerry Brown, then governor of California. When he was campaigning out of state, which was often in late 1979 and early 1980, Mike Curb, a Republican who was then serving as Lieutenant Governor of California often used his position as acting governor to veto legislation, promulgate executive orders, issue proclamations, and to do other things that Brown would not likely have done had he been present in the state. This eventually resulted in litigation, much of which went in Curb's favor. Powers of an acting governor had previously been questioned in the mid-1970s in Kentucky. In her capacity as acting governor of Kentucky in Julian Carroll's absence, Thelma Stovall, then-Lieutenant Governor, acting as governor, issued pardons, called the Kentucky General Assembly into special session to enact legislation limiting property tax increases, and purported to veto the legislature's repeal of its ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. The authority of the Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky to act as governor when the elected governor is out of state was repealed under a 1992 amendment to the Kentucky Constitution. In 1993, in Pennsylvania, Governor Robert P. Casey underwent surgery that left him incapacitated for months, thus leaving Lieutenant Governor Mark Singel as acting governor. During that time, Singel fulfilled all duties of the office of governor. Following the death of New Hampshire Governor Hugh Gallen, Vesta M. Roy, as president of the state Senate, served as acting governor of New Hampshire from December 30, 1982, to January 6, 1983. Practices in this area are anything but uniform from state to state. In Rhode Island, for example, the Lieutenant Governor never acts as governor, even if the Governor has left the state. In most of the states, when the governor dies, resigns or is removed from office (via impeachment conviction), the next in line become the new governor, succeeding to the office and powers.

He served with the Confederacy in the 1st Creek Mounted Volunteers, as Superintendent of Schools in the Creek Nation (1870), as commander of the Creek Light Horsemen (1883), and was many times the Creek delegate to the United States Congress. He was also President of the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention in 1905 during the attempt by Native American tribes to acquire statehood for the Indian Territory.Mullins, Jonita.

The Creek had a matrilineal kinship system, in which children took status in their mother's clan. He was born September 26, 1840 in what is now Wagoner County, Oklahoma. His Creek name was Talof Harjo, which means \\"Crazy Bear\\" in English.Everett, Dianna. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. \\"Porter, Pleasant (1840 - 1907).\\" Retrieved April 22, 2013.Meserve, John Bartlett. Chronicles of Oklahoma \\"Chief Pleasant Porter.\\" The family ranch was begun by his grandfather, John Snodgrass Porter, who had fought with Andrew Jackson against the Creek in Georgia after the massacre at Fort Mims. To minimize further bloodshed, Captain Porter volunteered to mediate between the Creek leaders and white army. Grateful for his efforts, the Creek adopted him into the tribe. First, he settled on Creek land in Russell County, Alabama. When the Indian Removal program began, he moved with the first group of Lower Creek who went to Indian Territory in the 1820s. There, he settled on the north bank of the Arkansas River and developed a plantation based on the labor of enslaved African Americans. As John Porter was dying in 1847, other family members gathered around his deathbed. His grandson Pleasant was seven and had Indian features. According to historian John Meserve, Porter put his hand on the boy's head and announced to the family, \\"He will do more than any of you.\\" Pleasant Porter was educated at the Tullahassee Mission School, where he spent five years. His home was bi-cultural, and he learned both Muscogee and English; this gave him the advantage of being able to operate well in both the white and Native American worlds when he became an adult. He supplemented this basic education by developing a lifelong habit of study at home. After leaving school, he clerked in a store for a while. He traveled to New Mexico, where he drove cattle until the outbreak of the Civil War. Civil War service During the Civil War, Porter served in the First Confederate Creek Regiment. He had enlisted as a Private under the command of Col. D. N. McIntosh (son of chief William McIntosh, who had been prominent prior to removal and was executed for ceding communal lands). Porter participated in several battles, including Round Mountain, Chusto-Talasah (Bird Creek), Chustenahlah, Pea Ridge and Honey Springs. He was wounded three times. Once wounded in the thigh, he walked with a limp for the rest of his life. Twice he was wounded in the head. His highest rank was Quartermaster Sergeant. Creek political life In 1865, Porter served as a guard for Creek commissioners who travelled to Fort Smith, Arkansas to begin peace negotiations with U. S. government representatives. The treaty was concluded and the Creek government reorganized in 1866. Porter was asked to reorganize the Creek Nation's schools, which had been disrupted by the war. In 1871, he was reelected as Superintendent of Schools, but declined this second term. =Tribal insurrections= The \\"Sands Rebellion\\" of 1871 was the culmination of grievances between two Creek factions. The name refers to the leader of a disgruntled group of Upper Creeks led by Oktars- sars-har-jo (known in English as \\"Sands\\".)Morton, Ohland. Chronicles of Oklahoma. Vol. 8, No. 1. \\"The Government of the Creek Indians.\\" March 1930. Retrieved April 23, 2013. When Principal Chief Samuel Checote convened the council in October 1871, nearly 300 Sands followers marched on the capital and dispersed the meeting. Pleasant Porter, commanding a group of Creek horsemen, and a group of Federal agents put down the short-lived rebellion without loss of life. Porter convinced the Sands followers to lay down their arms and go home. In the fall of 1872, the Creek Nation sent Porter to Washington, D.C. to represent the nation's interests with Congress and the government. He performed this work so effectively that he spent much of the rest of his life on business in the national capital. He soon became well-known and respected by members of Congress and several presidents, becoming a personal friend of Theodore Roosevelt. In 1875, Lachar Haijo was elected Principal Chief to replace Checote. Checote supporters controlled the Creek legislature and impeached Haijo, replacing him with a Checote supporter. Porter was called on to quell the subsequent demonstration and convinced the Haijo supporters to go home. In 1882, an Okmulgee judge named Isparhecher was charged with sedition and removed from office by the Creek National Council. He gathered about 350 followers of Sands and Haijo, established a military camp and formed a rival government, complete with armed light horsemen. Checote recalled Porter from Washington and put him in charge of about 700 men. This began what, according to Meserve, the Creeks called the \\"Green Peach War\\". Porter's troops chased their opponents into Sac and Fox territory in February 1883. Isperhecher and his remaining followers tried to gain asylum with the Kiowa, but U. S. troops captured them and sent them to Fort Gibson. According to Meserve, there were seven or eight casualties of the Green Peach War. Afterward, some Creek began calling Porter \\"General\\" as an honorific title. This was apparently purely honorific. Isparhecher remained the de facto leader of the full-bloods (then known as the Nuyaka faction). When Checote stepped down as principal chief in 1883, an election elevated a follower of Isparhecher to the position, narrowly defeating Isparhecher himself. Checote came in a distant third. Isparhecher served briefly in December 1883. On February 24, 1884, the Indian Agent at Muskogee, under orders from the Secretary of the Interior, whose department administered Native American affairs, officially recognized Joseph Perryman as the Principal Chief, although he was not elected by the Council.John Bartlett Meserve. Chronicles of Oklahoma. Vol. 10, No. 1, \\"Chief Isparhecher.\\"March 1932. Retrieved April 24, 2013. Under the terms of the Dawes Act, the Creek Nation had to agree to an allotment of former tribal lands to individual households, in an effort to force adaptation to European-American styles of farming and property ownership. Porter headed another Creek commission to negotiate the terms with Federal officials. Agreement was announced September 27, 1897 and incorporated as part of the Curtis Act, passed by Congress in June 1898. The US insisted that any land remaining after allotment would be considered \\"surplus\\" and made available for sale to non-Indians. Although the agreement was rejected by the Creek in an election on November 1, 1898, the Dawes Commission began to register tribal members for the process of allotment. Porter headed a delegation to Washington, C. C. in January 1889 to negotiate the terms for turning over some more of their land to the United States, as required by the 1866 peace treaty. At the time the treaty was signed, it was intended that these lands were to be used for the resettlement of other Native Americans and freedmen. The lands were not intended for settlement by whites. Now, the government wanted to open these so-called \\"unassigned lands\\" for white settlement. Porter and his delegation agreed to remove the restrictions on land use in exchange for $2.25 million. The agreement was signed on January 31, 1889. Pleasant Porter was elected Principal Chief on September 5, 1899. He and his delegation negotiated more concessions regarding rights of individual Creek members than had been allowed to many other tribes. But, many Creek opposed the allotment plan and break-up of communal land. In 1900, a leader of the full-blood faction, Chitto Harjo (\\"Crazy Snake\\"), declared a separate government. Porter appealed to the U. S. government for help putting down the revolt. A cavalry troop arrived and arrested the leaders in January 1901. Crazy Snake and his lieutenants pleaded guilty, were lectured by the judge, and sent home. Porter was reelected as Principal Chief in 1903. The powers of the office had been greatly reduced by the Curtis Act, so its duties were largely ceremonial or clerical. Much time was consumed signing land allotment deeds. Porter and other prominent leaders became interested in the movement to create a state out of Indian Territory, to be governed by Native Americans. The movement proposed to call it the State of Sequoyah, after the Cherokee who created an alphabet. Porter and the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention The Sequoyah Convention met in the Hinton Theater at Muskogee on August 21, 1905. The purposes were to draft a constitution for the proposed state, choose a name for the state, and name a capital city. Porter was elected permanent chairman of the convention. Other key officers elected by the delegates included Charles N. Haskell, vice chair and Alexander Posey, secretary. The delegates met again on the following day, then departed. They reconvened for a three-day meeting in September, at which the proposed constitution was overwhelmingly approved. At a third session on October 14, the delegates voted to authorize Porter and Posey to sign the document on behalf of all the delegates.Mize, Richard.

He also went into business as a merchant and rancher. He opened a general store at Okmulgee that he sold in 1869. He moved to Wealaka, built a home and lived there for the rest of his life. Pleasant Porter married Mary Ellen Keys in St. Louis, Missouri on November 25, 1872. She was born in the Cherokee Nation on April 6, 1854, the daughter of Judge Riley Keys and his wife; he was chief justice of the courts of the Cherokee Nation for twenty-five years.

It stars Val Kilmer (in his film debut role) and Lucy Gutteridge alongside a supporting cast featuring Omar Sharif, Peter Cushing, Michael Gough, and Jeremy Kemp. The film parodies various film styles such as musicals starring Elvis Presley, spy films of the Cold War era and World War II films. The original music score was composed by Maurice Jarre. Plot Nick Rivers, an American rock star (\\"Skeet Surfin'\\"), travels to East Germany (which is represented as like Hitler's regime) to perform at a cultural festival, which secretly serves the East German government as a diversion for a military operation with the intent of reuniting Germany under their rule. At a dinner, Nick encounters Hillary Flammond, a member of the local resistance movement who is attempting to avoid the authorities. He pretends to be her date to get to know her, and performs an impromptu song and dance (\\"Tutti Frutti\\"), mistakenly thinking he was asked to do so, to the delight of Hillary and the diners but to the annoyance of General Streck, the mastermind of the \\"reunification\\" plot. Nick later sees Hillary at a ballet, where she expects to rendezvous with the resistance leader but is met by the police instead. Nick saves her and they try to escape, but Nick turns himself in so that Hillary can get away. He is taken to a prison where he is questioned and tortured, but he knows nothing and does not break. In an escape attempt, he ends up in the secret prison lab of Dr. Paul Flammond, a brilliant scientist developing the \\"Polaris naval mine\\", a device that can destroy the entire NATO submarine fleet as part of the government's plot. The Germans force him to work by threatening to kill his daughter Hillary. Nick is recaptured and scheduled for execution. The East Germans decide that Nick must perform to avoid an international incident, and he does so to the rapturous joy of the local girls (\\"How Silly Can You Get\\"/\\"Spend This Night with Me\\"). He is rescued by Hillary at the end of his performance, after which they spend the night in the loft of a Swedish bookstore. Nick plays for her (\\"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\\") and they make love. The next morning, they are moved to the \\"Potato Farm\\" where they meet members of the French Resistance, led by Nigel \\"The Torch\\", who was Hillary's lover from when they were stranded on an island as youths. Nick is upset by Hillary's love for Nigel, but accepts that they must work together for the cause. After fighting off an attack by the Germans (who were tipped off by a mystery traitor) they move to a pizza restaurant, where Nick proves his identity by performing for the locals (\\"Straighten Out the Rug\\"). The resistance group stages a rescue of Dr. Flammond, where Nigel and Du Quois, a resistance leader, dress up in a fake cow outfit to disable the prison's defenses. While the other members successfully infiltrate the prison, Nigel reveals himself as the traitor. Dr. Flammond is rescued, but Nigel makes off with Hillary, and Nick is forced to rescue her in an underwater bar fight. With their flight about to leave, Hillary chooses to go with Nick and her father to America.

David Zucker said they had been working on the script since Airplane! \\"but we just couldn't figure out how to do it. We made repeated attempts to combine a rock and roll movie with a World War II movie but it was very difficult to do ... We already had ideas for scenes we wanted to do and we tried to fit in plot around those scenes\\". A fourth writer, Martyn Burke, was brought in to work on the plot. \\"If it weren't for Martyn we'd still be sitting in that room\\", said Jerry Zucker. The film was mostly written at the offices of ZAZ's lawyers. The film's budget was a reported $8.5 million, whereas Airplane! was made for $3.2 million. Key portions of Top Secret! are parodies of The Conspirators, including the street scene with the novelty vendor. =Casting= Kilmer was cast after the directors saw him in a play called Slab Boys with Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon. He turned up to the audition dressed like Elvis Presley. \\"I like to think of it as the role Elvis never got but should have\\", said Abrahams. Lucy Gutteridge, who plays the female lead, had just appeared in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of Nicholas Nickleby. Unlike Airplane!, the film does not feature a large number of cameos by famous actors, because, as Zucker explained, \\"That was one of the jokes in Airplane! and we had done it and wanted to move on.\\" Two well-known actors who were cast in the film include Omar Sharif as Agent Cedric and Peter Cushing as a Swedish bookstore proprietor. Soundtrack Release The film was test screened at various colleges and as a result of audience responses, the length was cut from around two hours to 90 minutes. The film was scheduled for release on June 8, 1984 but Paramount pushed the date back to June 22, angering some exhibitors. The official reason was that Paramount wanted to avoid competing against Ghostbusters and Gremlins although rumours spread that the studio was dissatisfied with the film's quality. Producer Jon Davison denied this saying \\"Paramount has a lot of confidence in the picture or they wouldn't have cared. The mere fact that they've bothered to trouble some of their relationships with exhibitors shows their faith in the picture.\\" =Box office= The film was considered a box-office bomb, though it still earned $20 million.

According to MƒÅori tradition, the name Kaipara had its origins back in the 15th century when the Arawa chief, Kahumatamomoe, travelled to the Kaipara to visit his nephew at Pouto. At a feast, he was so impressed with the cooked root of the para fern, that he gave the name Kai- para to the district. Kaipara comes from the MƒÅori meaning \\"food\\", and meaning \\"king fern\\". __TOC__  Geography  The harbour extends for some from north to south. Several large arms extend into the interior of the peninsula at the northeast of the harbour, one of them ending near the town of Maungaturoto, only ten kilometres (6 mi) from the Pacific Ocean coast. The harbour has extensive catchments feeding five rivers and over a hundred streams, and includes large estuaries formed by the Wairoa, Otamatea, Oruawharo, Tauhoa (Channel) and Kaipara. A number of small islands off the shoreline are connected to the mainland by mudflats at low tide. The Kaipara Harbour is broad and mostly shallow, as it is formed from a system of drowned river valleys.Hume, T. M. & Herdendorf, CE (1988) A geomorphic classification of estuaries and its application to coastal resource management - a New Zealand example. Ocean and Shoreline Management, 11 :249-274. The harbour shoreline is convoluted by the entry of many rivers and streams, and is about long,Kaipara - Kumeu Catchment Management Plan being the drainage catchment for about 640,000 ha of land. The harbour entrance is a channel to the Tasman Sea. It narrows to a width of ,Haggit T, Mead S, and Bellingham M (2008) Kaipara Harbour Environmental Information Review ARC Technical Publication TP 354. and is over deep in parts. On average, Kaipara tides rise and fall . Spring tidal flows reach 9 km/h (5 knots) in the entrance channel and move 1,990 million cubic metres per tidal movement or 7,960 million cubic metres daily.Bellve, AR; Austin, G and Woods, B (2007) Pathway to energy generation from marine tidal currents in New Zealand's Kaipara Harbour University of Auckland. The harbour head is a hostile place. Big waves from the Tasman Sea break over large sandbanks about five metres below the surface, two to five kilometres from the shore. The sand in these sandbanks comes mainly from the Waikato River. Sand discharged from this river is transported northward by the prevailing coastal currents. Some of this sand is carried into the Kaipara harbour entrance, but mostly cycles out again and then continues moving northwards along the west coast. The southern sandbanks at the entrance are constantly accumulating and releasing this sand. These treacherous sandbanks shift and change position, and are known locally as the graveyard. The graveyard is responsible for more shipwrecks than any other place in New Zealand, and has claimed at least 43 vessels‚Äîsome say as many as 110.Gerard Hutching.

In MƒÅori mythology, the ocean-going canoe MƒÅhuhu voyaged from Hawaiki to New Zealand and overturned on the northern side of the entrance. It was commanded by the chief Rongomai, who drowned. His body was eaten by araara (white trevally), and his descendants to this day will not eat that type of fish. The first European shipwreck was the Aurora, a 550-ton barque, in 1840,Brett, Henry (1928), White Wings (volume II) The Aurora The Brett Printing Company and the most recent was the yacht Aosky in 1994. Today, the remains of wrecks still become visible under certain tidal and sand conditions. The Kaipara is rarely used today for shipping, and no large settlements lie close to its shores, although many small communities lie along its coastline.  Ecology  kai) of the king fern (para) 105mm British light guns The Kaipara Harbour is a productive marine ecosystem, with diverse habitats and ecotones. There are tidal reaches, intertidal mudflats and sandflats, freshwater swamps, maritime rushes, reed beds and coastal scrublands.Kaipara Harbour The area includes 125 square kilometres of mangrove forest.Kaukapakapa River Estuary Environment end Effects of Discharge Chp 6, Page 1. 2007.

File:BartailedGodwit24.jpg|Bar-tailed godwit File:Fernbird.jpg|Fern bird File:Clianthus puniceus.jpg|Kaka beak leaves and flowers The Kaipara is a migratory bird habitat of international significance. Forty‚Äìtwo coastal species are known, and up to 50,000 birds are common. Rare species use the harbour for feeding during summer before returning to the Northern Hemisphere to breed, such as the bar-tailed godwit, lesser knot, and turnstone. Threatened or endangered native species, such as the North Island fernbird, fairy tern, crake, Australasian bittern, banded rail, grey‚Äëfaced petrels, banded and NZ dotterels, South Island pied oystercatcher, pied stilt, and wrybill are also present . Significant local populations of black swan, pukeko, and grey duck also breed in the area. Land habitats adjacent to the harbour support some rare botanical species, including native orchids, the king fern, and the endangered kaka beak. In particular, Papakanui Spit on the south head of the harbour entrance, a mobile sandspit, is important as a breeding and roosting area for the New Zealand dotterel and the fairy tern. It also has areas of pingao.South spit Kaipara Forest and Bird The spit was an important habitat for the Caspian tern.

Human use  = MƒÅori history= MƒÅori settlements and marae have been scattered around the harbour margins for hundreds of years. The waterways of the Kaipara provided, and still provide, MƒÅori with resources and a ready means of moving between marae. Today most marae are associated with the NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua sub- tribes, Te Tao≈´ and Te Uri-o-Hau. These sub-tribes both descend from the chief HaumoewhƒÅrangi who settled on the north end of the Kaipara entrance at Pout≈ç. He was killed in an argument about k≈´mara (sweet potatoes). His widow Waihekeao developed a partnership with a Tainui warrior chief, KƒÅwharu. KƒÅwharu led several destructive campaigns around Kaipara. Eventually the descendants of Waihekeao and HaumoewhƒÅrangi came to control the Kaipara Harbour. Te Uri-o-Hau was founded by Hakiputat≈çmuri, and controlled the northern part of Kaipara Harbour. Te Tao≈´ was founded by Mawake, and controlled the south.RƒÅwiri Taonui.

In 1839, European settlers began arriving in the Kaipara to fell and mill kauri trees and build boats for local requirements. Despite the perilous bar at the harbour entrance, the Kaipara became a busy timber port from the 1860s, shipping thousands of tonnes of kauri timber and gum. The first sailing ship wrecked at the entrance to the harbour was the Aurora in April 1840.The Amelia Thompson, White Wings Vol II. Founding of the Provinces And Old-Time Shipping. Passenger Ships From 1840 To 1885, Henry Brett, The Brett Printing Company, 1928, Auckland, pages 51-52 The brigantine Sophia Pate was wrecked at South Head in August 1841 with the loss of all 21 on board.Ryburn, Wayne (1999). Tall Spars, Steamers & Gum. Auckland, N.Z.: Kaipara Publications. p. 230. The Wairoa is the main river feeding the Kaipara from the north. Thirty kilometres upstream, the town of Dargaville was established. The stretch of water to Dargaville is broad and straight and provides an easy to navigate route into what were then kauri forests in the interior. Dargaville flourished and immigrants from Britain and Croatia were attracted to the area. Ships up to 3,000 tons carried timber and logs out along the Wairoa to defy the bar at the harbour entrance before continuing on, usually to another New Zealand port or across the Tasman to Australia.Claudia Orange. Northland places: Dargaville and the Northern Wairoa Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 8-May-2008 The Kaipara River is the principal river feeding Kaipara Harbour from the south. From 1863 Helensville established itself as a timber port on this river, and provided shipping services about the Kaipara. When the timber ran out, Helensville developed sheep and dairy farms, and more recently nut plantations, vineyards and deer farms. Further south, Riverhead was an important trading link with the Kaipara and Helensville, and a centre for gum digging. Also set by a river, it milled timber and flour, and made paper. Later it turned to tobacco. From 1929 to 1933, the Riverhead State Forest was developed from 5,000 ha of exhausted gum land. As the kauri ran out, the Kaipara became a backwater. After 1920 the gum and timber industries dwindled, and farming, mainly dairying, took over. In particular, there is dairying on the rich RuƒÅwai flats. These flats are below sea level, and are protected by a stopbank and a drainage system. Coastal sawmill settlements at Tinopai, Arapaoa, Batley, Matakohe, Oneriri, ≈åruawharo, Pahi, Paparoa, Tanoa and Whakapirau (history photos on the Whakapirau Community Website) have become quiet backwaters. Pahi has become a launch point for houseboats and fishing. Matakohe has a museum which commemorates the kauri industry and the early PƒÅkehƒÅ settlers. Today, Dargaville is the principle centre in the Kaipara area. Its population levelled in the 1960s. It is the country's main k≈´mara (sweet potato) producer. =Fisheries= Juvenile white trevally (araara) New Zealand cockle Much of the coastal fishing industry in New Zealand depends on mangrove forests. About 80% of fish caught commercially are linked to food chains dependent on the mangroves, and at least 30 species of fish use mangrove wetlands at some stage of their life cycle. The marine and estuarine areas in the Kaipara Harbour breed snapper, mullet, flounder, sole, kahawai, white trevally, gurnard, yellow‚Äëeyed mullet and skates, rays and sharks.Department of Conservation (1990) Coastal resource inventory: First order survey - Northland conservancy. Department of Conservation, Wellington. The Kaipara is the largest estuarine harbour on the west coast of New Zealand and provides significant areas of suitable breeding grounds and habitats for juvenile fish. It has fewer problems with water quality than the Manukau, and is the single most significant wetland for west coast fisheries. In 2009, NIWA scientists discovered that 98 percent of snapper on the west coast of the North Island were originally juveniles from nurseries in the Kaipara. Snapper is New Zealand's largest recreational fishery, and is also a commercial fishery with an annual export value of $32 million. The findings show how fragile some fish stocks can be, and highlights the importance of protecting natural habitats, like the Kaipara. Native rock oysters are plentiful on the rocky shores, and the introduced Pacific oysters flourish lower in the intertidal zone. There are cockles and tuatua on the lower tidal flats, mussels from low tide on the rocks to subtidal beds closer to the mouth of the harbour, and scallops in the tidal channels. The scallop population has periodic incidences of high mortality, the causes of which have not been identified. Concerns in recent years about the size and availability of scallops have resulted in temporary closures of the scallop fisheries.Kaipara Harbour scallop fishery needs more time to build Early versions of oyster farming occurred between the early 1900s and 1950s. Thousands of tons of rocks were placed along the shorelines to act as an additional substrate on which the natural rock oyster could grow.Variety In Brief: Praise for New Zealand The New Zealand Railways Magazine, 1938, 13(9) In 2002, the Crown settled the historical claims of Te Uri o Hau, a hapu of the northern Kaipara Harbour. As part of the settlement, access to and the rights of the hapu to gather oysters within the existing \\"Maori Oyster Areas\\" were recognised. Management of Oyster Reserves in the Kaipara Harbour In 2008, resource consent was given to Biomarine to establish New Zealand's largest oyster farm in the Kaipara. The farm is projected to produce about NZ$30 million in annual exports and 100 new jobs.Oyster Farm for Kaipara In recent years, there has been a perception amongst locals that commercial fishers have damaged fisheries in the Kaipara. Locals have been frustrated in their attempts to gain government support. The veteran filmmaker Barry Barclay has examined this in his 2005 documentary, The Kaipara affair.Claudia Orange.

This sand contributes over half the sand requirements for Auckland. The sand is used in the production of concrete and asphalt, and also in drainage systems and beach nourishment. A suction pump is usually used to extract the sand from the seabed. It is pumped into a barge as a sand and water slurry. As the barge loads, shells and other objects are screened out and the sea water drained back to the sea. The availability of sea sand within the Auckland region means the road costs of transporting sand from further parts of the country are avoided.Sand mining on the East Coast and in the Kaipara Harbour Auckland Regional Council Concerns about possible negative consequences of this sand mining have also been raised. Kiwis Against Seabed MiningMining the sea sand =Tidal power= In 2008, Crest Energy, a power company, received resource consent to install about 200 underwater tidal turbines in the Kaipara Harbour, which would use the substantial tidal flows moving in and out every day near the harbour mouth to produce electricity for approximately 250,000 homes.Crest Energy Crest plans to place the turbines at least 30 metres deep along a ten kilometre stretch of the main channel. Historical charts show this stretch of the channel has changed little over 150 years. The output of the turbines will cycle twice daily with the predictable rise and fall of the tide. Each turbine will have a maximum output of 1.2 MW, and is expected to generate 0.75 MW averaged over time.FAQ Crest Energy The peak level of generation for the combined turbines is about 200 MW. This exceeds the projected peak electricity needs of Northland. It would have environmental benefits in offsetting annual carbon emissions from a thermal- based, gas turbine generator of 575,000 tonnes of carbon. The project is costed at about $600 million and to be economic would have to be scaled up rapidly to near full capacity. However, while the Department of Conservation has approved the project, and has made substantial environmental monitoring conditions part of the consent, the project also has objectors on the grounds of claimed influences on the local ecosystems and charter fishing (see the section above on fisheries). Appeals before the Environment Court are still likely.Harnessing tidal power not all smooth sailing - The Business Herald (insert of The New Zealand Herald), Friday 29 August 2008, page 22. Management issues Management of the Kaipara Harbour does not have a central administration. Management is distributed among the Kaipara District Council, Auckland Council, Northland Regional Council, the Department of Conservation's Northland and Auckland section, and the Ministry of Fisheries. The Ministry of Fishing allocates quota for the north west region of New Zealand as a whole, but does not tailor quota specifically for the Kaipara. Local iwi feel they are not sufficiently involved in management issues, and to further compound matters, the local iwi is split between Te Uri-o-Hau in the northern part and Te Tao≈´ in the southern part. Ecological management and environmental issues are discussed in the Ecology section.  Environmental issues  As of 2011, the environmental state of the harbour has been called as \\"nearing crisis\\" and \\"in significant decline\\", with shrinking fish and shellfish stocks, more sedimentation, declining water quality and competition for resource use and development being noted as the main issues, with \\"ninety- nine per cent of the rivers in the catchment [are] polluted\\". As part of the worldwide trend, there is a decline in biodiversity within the Kaipara.Management issues. Integrated Kaipara Harbour Management Group. The timber industry removed most of the native forest. Much of the kauri and kahikatea forest, and scrub and riparian vegetation, has been replaced with farm and urban areas. Mangrove forests and wetlands have been \\"reclaimed\\". Soil erosion has increased on the land and sedimentation in the harbour. Shellfish abundance has declined, especially toheroa, scallops, tuatua, cockles and pipi. Finfish like mullet, snapper, kanae and school shark have diminished. Habitat fragmentation has also occurred. Natural vegetation in the Kaipara catchments have been reduced to islands of wetlands and forest in man- made landscapes‚Äîseparated by urban areas, roads, exotic forests and pastures. More information is needed on biodiversity in the Kaipara Harbour and habitats in associated coastal areas. A recent pilot survey found that habitats in the estuaries are still extensive, but ninety percent of land cover is no longer indigenous wetland or vegetation. Even if the key existing areas were to be protected, further buffers and corridors that give better connection between the natural areas would be needed to encourage the recovery of biodiversity.

He is best known for his tenure in WWE, where he was a one-time United States Champion, and his time with TNA Wrestling.  Professional wrestling career  = World Wrestling Entertainment =  Early years (2003‚Äì2004)  Jordan made his WWE television debut on the May 31, 2003 episode of Velocity, where he defeated Jamie Noble. On June 26, 2003, Jordan made his first SmackDown! appearance as a face at Madison Square Garden, where he lost to John Cena. Although he did not win the match, he was impressive enough that when Cena attacked Jordan after the match was over, The Undertaker, with whom Cena was feuding, came to the ring and helped Jordan to his feet. On the October 2 episode of SmackDown!, Jordan defeated Big Show via countout when Big Show had to run to the restroom after eating a burrito laced with laxatives. Jordan answered an open challenge hosted by Brock Lesnar on the January 29, 2004 episode of SmackDown!, where he was quickly defeated.  The Cabinet and United States Champion (2004‚Äì2005)  John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield's (right) Cabinet After an absence of multiple months due to family issues, Jordan returned on the August 5 episode of SmackDown!, defeating Ren√© Dupr√©e. Later in the night, Jordan turned heel by saving WWE Champion John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield (JBL) from an attack by the Undertaker. On the August 12 episode of SmackDown!, Jordan joined Layfield's Cabinet, where he was appointed \\"Chief of Staff\\". Jordan faced the Undertaker in the main event later that night, losing by disqualification after Layfield attacked Undertaker mid-match. On the August 26 episode of SmackDown!, Jordan once again faced Undertaker, this time with Layfield's WWE Championship on the line. The match once again ended in a disqualification after Layfield again interfered. On the November 25 episode of SmackDown!, Jordan and Layfield defeated Eddie Guerrero and Booker T, after interference from The Basham Brothers, who were made the Cabinet's \\"co-secretaries of defense\\" on the December 2 episode of SmackDown!. Jordan, Layfield and the Bashams were defeated by Booker T, the Undertaker and Eddie Guerrero in a 4-on-3 handicap match on the December 9 episode of SmackDown!. Jordan entered his first Royal Rumble match at the titular event on January 30, 2005, but was eliminated by Booker T. After Layfield began a feud with John Cena over the WWE title leading up to WrestleMania 21, Jordan faced off with Cena on the March 3 edition of SmackDown!. Orlando defeated John Cena with the help of Layfield to win the United States Championship, his first and only title in WWE. At WrestleMania 21, Jordan competed in a 30-man battle royal, won by Booker T. His first major successful title defense was against Heidenreich at Judgment Day. At The Great American Bash, Jordan began feuding with the newly drafted Chris Benoit. Jordan defeated Benoit and retained his United States Championship after removing the turnbuckle pad and shoving Benoit head-first into the exposed steel and covered him for the win. Benoit continued to chase Jordan for the title. He finally defeated Jordan (in a record 25.5 seconds) at SummerSlam to win the title. Following this quick match, Jordan attempted to win his title back on multiple occasions, leading to 3 consecutive losses with all matches lasting less than a minute. The first rematch lasted 23.4 seconds. During the second rematch, Jordan actually almost knocked out Benoit with a punch in the opening moments but still lost at 22.5 seconds, which was even faster than the first match. During the third match, Jordan stalled until the time, which was being displayed on the TitanTron, went over 25 seconds. He got so excited when his time went over 30 seconds that he dropped his guard and Benoit took the opportunity to lock on the Sharpshooter for a win at the 49.8 second mark. Earlier in the show, Orlando stated that he had mastered every counter to Benoit's signature Crippler Crossface, which was shown when during the match every time Benoit attempted the Crippler Crossface, Jordan countered it. On the October 14 edition of SmackDown!, Jordan stated that he mastered every counter to Benoit's signature Crippler Crossface. Jordan also stated, if he tapped out to the Crippler Crossface, Jordan would quit this business. Jordan lived up to his words by countering every Crippler Crossface attempt by Benoit. The match ultimately ended after Jordan tapped out to Benoit's Sharpshooter. After those unsuccessful rematches, Jordan later broke away from Layfield, although both later made a few appearances together later on.  Various feuds and departure (2005‚Äì2006)  Tatanka in 2006 When Booker T got injured halfway through his Best of Seven series for the United States Championship, he needed a replacement to face Chris Benoit. As the series was at 3‚Äì1 in Booker's favor, Booker T only needed his replacement to win one match in order to become the United States Champion. Jordan approached him about the position, but Booker T and his wife Sharmell belittled him and made jokes about his quick submission losses to Benoit. Booker asked Randy Orton to substitute for him. After Orton failed to win the deciding match, leading Jordan to once again ask for the position the next week, Booker T once again turned Jordan down after belittling him. During the sixth match in the series, Jordan jumped the rail, grabbed Booker T's crutch, and hit Benoit for a disqualification finish and thus giving Benoit the victory and tying the Best of Seven Series at 3‚Äì3. The next week, Jordan ran to ringside to attempt to halt Booker T from winning the championship, but was unable to prevent Orton from eventually beating Benoit to win the series for Booker T. On the January 20 episode of SmackDown!, Jordan faced and lost to Randy Orton after Booker's wife Sharmell distracted the SmackDown! senior official referee Nick Patrick, before Booker hit him with a leg crutch. After the match, Chris Benoit saved him from Booker and Orton, turning him face for the first time since 2004. Jordan was then pushed down to Velocity and won several matches there. Jordan made his final SmackDown! appearance on the May 12 episode of SmackDown! in a backstage segment, telling Nunzio that he had seen someone who looked like his partner Vito dressed in drag at a night club during the recent UK tour. His final WWE appearance was a loss to Gunner Scott on the May 13 episode of Velocity. On May 26, 2006, WWE announced that Jordan was released from his WWE contract. Reports allege that it was due to Jordan bringing unauthorized people backstage with him. = Independent circuit (2006‚Äì2010) = Jordan during the Hulkamania tour of Australia in 2008 Jordan began competing on the independent circuit soon after his WWE departure along with wrestling overseas, most notably for Nu-Wrestling Evolution, a promotion based in Italy, as well as New Japan Pro Wrestling. Jordan became NWE Champion in April 2008. Later in that month, he was involved in a confrontation with the Ultimate Warrior, leading to the return of Warrior after a ten-year absence to face Jordan in a match in June 2008.

It launched the television careers of Eric Bana, Shaun Micallef, Kitty Flanagan and Julia Morris. In 1998 a spin-off of the show moved to Network Ten under the name Totally Full Frontal, losing most of the original cast in the process; it finished in 1999. Since 2008, re-runs have begun screening on The Comedy Channel as part of the channel's \\"Aussie Gold\\" block of locally made, classic comedy programming. History The series began screening shortly after the similar sketch comedy program Fast Forward (from which Full Frontal derived) ended. Full Frontal retained the same general format of Fast Forward. It was formatted in a way such as to create the effect of someone continuously channel surfing; after the punchline of each sketch, it would abruptly switch to the next as if the viewer had switched channels. However, the new show had an all-new regular cast. Initially, some members of the Fast Forward cast made guest appearances in occasional Full Frontal sketches, easing the transition into the new series. Several members of the new cast had appeared in the earlier The Comedy Company, including Kym Gyngell and Glenn Butcher. The show first aired on the Seven Network on 13 May 1993, and finished on 15 September 1997.

It was billed by Miramax as \\"an unofficial sequel of sorts\\" to Sex, Lies, and Videotape. In October, Julia Roberts, David Hyde Pierce, and David Duchovny were announced as leads in the project, and after the September 11 attacks, the film title was changed to The Art of Negotiating a Turn. After a phone call with Harvey Weinstein because he did not like the new movie title, Soderbergh suggested the title Full Frontal. The production on the film began on November 6, 2001. Release Full Frontal had a limited release in the United States on August 2, 2002, opening in 208 theaters, and earning $739,834 its first weekend. The film was released in the United Kingdom on May 23, 2003, and failed to reach the Top 10. It received negative reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 38% based on reviews from 142 critics, with the site's consensus: \\"An confusing movie made worse by the poor camera work.\\" Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert called Full Frontal \\"a film so amateurish that only the professionalism of some of the actors makes it watchable\\". Richard Roeper also gave the film a poor review, writing that it was \\"like the 'Special Features' disc of the DVD without the original movie\\". USA Today gave the film three out of four stars, recommending it for its \\"humor and talented cast\\".

Its distance from Earth is about 25.2 million light-years or 7.72 megaparsecs, similar to the distance of M101 (NGC 5457) in the constellation Ursa Major. Both were once considered to be part of the Local Group. but are now known to be among the dozen bright spiral galaxies near the Milky Way but beyond the confines of the Local Group. NGC 6946 lies within the Virgo Supercluster. Discovered by William Herschel on 9 September 1798, this well- studied galaxy has a diameter of approximately 40,000 light-years , about one- third of the Milky Way's size, and it contains roughly half the number of stars as the Milky Way. It is heavily obscured by interstellar matter due to its location close to the galactic plane of the Milky Way, with a dimming of ~1.5 magnitudes.http://www.messier.seds.org/xtra/supp/o_NED.html#n6946 Due to its prodigious star formation it has been classified as an active starburst galaxy. Various unusual celestial objects have been observed within NGC 6964. This includes the so-called 'Red Ellipse' along one of the northern arms that looks like a super-bubble or very large supernova remnant, and which may have been formed by an open cluster containing massive stars. There are also two regions of unusual dark lanes of nebulosity, while within the spiral arms several regions appear devoid of stars and gaseous hydrogen, some spanning up to two kiloparsecs across. A third peculiar object, discovered in 1967, is now known as \\"Hodge's Complex\\". This was once thought to be a young supergiant cluster, but in 2017 it was conjectured to be an interacting dwarf galaxy superimposed on NGC 6964. Supernovae Ten supernovae have been observed in NGC 6946 in the last century: SN 1917A, SN 1939C, SN 1948B, SN 1968D, SN 1969P, SN 1980K, SN 2002hh, SN 2004et, SN 2008S, and SN 2017eaw. For this reason NGC 6946 in 2005 was dubbed the \\"Fireworks Galaxy\\", a name becoming increasingly popular. NGC 6946 has an unusually high rate of supernovae production compared to our Milky Way galaxy, whose rate averages just one supernova event per century. This is the more remarkable as our Galaxy comprises twice as many stars. On 27 September 2004, the Type II supernova SN 2004et was observed at magnitude 15.2 and rose to a maximum visual magnitude of 12.7. Images taken several days earlier revealed no such star, indicating destruction of the star occurred on the 22 September. The progenitor of SN 2004et has been identified on earlier images ‚Äì‚Äì only the seventh time that such an event was directly identified with its host star. The red supergiant progenitor had an initial mass of about 15 in an interacting binary system shared with a blue supergiant. During 2009, a bright star within the galaxy NGC 6946 flared up over several months to become over one million times as bright as the Sun. Shortly thereafter it appeared to vanish. New observations with the Hubble Space Telescope strongly suggest that the star did not survive, although a faint trickle of infrared light emanates from where the star used to be. The remnant glow probably comes from debris falling onto a black hole that formed when the star died. This potential black hole-forming star is designated N6946-BH1. Based on UBVR photometry, the star was determined to most likely be an early G-type supergiant star. In May 2017, supernova SN 2017eaw was first observed to be 12.8 magnitude in the northwest region of the galaxy and light curves obtained over the next 600 days showed that it was a Type II-P. The progenitor was determined to have been a ~ 15M_{\\\\odot} red supergiant before going nova.

The inhabitants of the town of Mont- Saint-Aignan are \\"Mont-Saint-Aignanais\\".\\"Commune\\" Due to the presence of higher education institutions (notably the University of Rouen and the NEOMA Business School) and the city's relatively small population, Mont-Saint-Aignan is considered the French city that has the largest proportion of students relative to its population (students represented in 2014 25,61% of the total population). Classement des villes √©tudiantes Geography The town is the fifth-largest suburb of the city of Rouen and lies directly adjacent to the north side of Rouen at the junction of the D 121 and D 43. In addition to its population of 21,265, there are also around 20,000 students at the University and the various Grandes √âcoles. History The parishes of Saint-Aignan (Sanctum Anianum) and Mont-aux-Malades (Monte Infirmorum, which takes its name from a hospital) are mentioned in documents dating back to the 12th century. Henry II built a church there dedicated to Thomas Becket in 1176 in an attempt to make up for his unwitting role in the murder of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The modern commune of Mont-Saint-Aignan was created in the early 19th century (1815‚Äì1819) out of the merger of the communes of Monts-aux- Malades, Saint-Aignan and (partly) Saint-Denis-de-Bondeville. = Heraldry = People *Maurice Euzennat (1926‚Äì2004), historian and archaeologist *Jacques Anquetil (1934‚Äì1987), first cyclist to win the Tour de France five times *Viviane Asseyi, footballer *Ousmane Camara, basketball player *Flora Coquerel, Miss France 2014 *Thierry Foucaud (1954- ), politician *Jamel Ait Ben Idir, footballer *Lagaf', humorist and television presenter *Matthieu Louis-Jean, footballer *S√©bastien Larcier, footballer *Jackson Mendy, footballer *Tony Parker, basketball player *Mohamed Sissoko, footballer *Lucien Tesni√®re (1893‚Äì1954), linguist *S√©bastien Le Toux, footballer *govy, artist *Franck Haise, football manager and former player Population Places of interest * The church of St. Jacques, dating from the eleventh century, used as a workshop after the Revolution. * The church of St. Thomas, dating from the twelfth century. * The sixteenth century church of St. Aignan. * The nineteenth century church of St. Andr√©. * The modern church of Notre- Dame-de-Mis√©ricorde (1970). * The chapel of the Petit-S√©minaire (1862). * Several ancient houses.

Publication history The broader history behind the alien robot species covered in this article was introduced in Justice League of America #140 (March 1977), in a story by Steve Englehart and Dick Dillin. Fictional character biography =Interstellar police= Manhunters and Guardians of the Universe, as seen in Secret Origins vol. 2 #22 (January 1988), artist Howard Simpson. The Manhunters were the first attempt of the Guardians of the Universe to create an interstellar police force that would combat evil all over the cosmos. Their name and much of their code of behavior was modeled by the Guardians of the Universe on the Manhunters of Ma'aleca'andra (Mars) millions of years ago (This creates an apparent chronology problem, since the Manhunters were created many millions of years ago, while the Green Martian race were retconned as having come into existence from the Burning Martians only about 20,000 years ago. For thousands of years, they served the Guardians well. However, the Manhunters became obsessed with the act of \\"hunting\\" criminals. Their code, \\"No man escapes the Manhunters\\" (corrupted from the original \\"No evil...\\"), became more important to them than seeing justice done. =Exile= Eventually, the robots conspired to rebel against their masters, but the Guardians defeated and destroyed most of them. Those that survived hid away on many planets, slowly rebuilding their forces and spreading their beliefs to others. Since then, the over-riding goal of the Manhunters has been to take revenge on the Guardians, as well as on their replacements, the Green Lantern Corps. The Manhunters infiltrated and liberated many planets disguised as living beings and created a \\"Cult of the Manhunters\\" that trained others to be their minions. On Mars, the people of that world started a group of Martian Manhunters based on the lessons of preserving justice taught unto them by the Manhunters and even erected a temple based on the appearance of their inspiration. On Earth, most of the Manhunters' agents were unaware that their masters were robots, or that their real purposes were not noble. Some of these agents became superheroes also known as Manhunters. They wore red-and-blue costumes patterned after the Manhunters themselves. The most famous of these was a big game hunter called Paul Kirk. He was active in the 1940s, and starred in his own series. The character was brought back in a modern version in the 70s, in which he was supposedly killed years before but was in truth placed in suspended animation by a secret conspiracy. He was cloned, and when he finally reawoke, he dedicated himself to battling those who had used him, eventually dying in the process, but some of his clones survived. The Manhunters were discovered by the Justice League who seemingly defeated the Manhunter's leader, the Grandmaster. One of their human pawns, Mark Shaw, adopted a new identity as the costumed hero, the Privateer but was later discovered to be a criminal posing as a hero. =Millennium= A Grandmaster from Millennium #1. Years later, it was revealed that the Manhunters not only still existed, but had infiltrated the lives of most superheroes with their agents. They even managed to infiltrate the Olympian Gods, one of their number posing as the goat god Pan, as shown during the Challenge of the Gods storyline. They revealed themselves when a Guardian and a member of the Zamarons tried to evolve some humans into becoming the next Guardians of the Universe, during what became known as the Millennium crisis. On this occasion, there was a massive counterstrike operation by the heroes against the Manhunters, and it seemed that the Grandmaster had finally been destroyed, along with their hidden home planet. Former Privateer Mark Shaw readopted his identity as Manhunter in the wake of the battle, seeking to redeem both the name and himself.Secret Origins issue #22, 1988 (Millennium tie-in focusing on the Manhunters' post-Crisis on Infinite Earths retconned history) =Post-Emerald Twilight= Kyle Rayner encountered the Manhunters not long after Hal Jordan's destruction of the Guardians and the Central Power Battery on Oa. The first of the androids encountered a still inexperienced Kyle Rayner and was almost able to defeat him using brute force until Kyle used his wits to outsmart and destroy it (Green Lantern Vol. 3 #117). The next time, multiple Manhunters appeared. They were all sentient individuals, upgraded by a passing alien ship with technology onboard that gave them a hive consciousness. They would capture Kyle in an attempt to use his last remaining Green Lantern ring for their purposes. They failed and Kyle managed to escape (Green Lantern Vol. 3 #129-131). =Sector 3601= Green Lantern #12 (July 2006). Manhunter technology. Art by Ivan Reis. When the Manhunters were replaced by the Green Lantern Corps, they retreated to Biot, their homeworld in Sector 3601, an uncharted area of space incapable of sustaining organic life. Hank Henshaw, the Cyborg Superman, came to Biot and became the Manhunters' new Grandmaster. He used his mastery over machinery and Kryptonian technology to upgrade the Manhunters with organic enhancements, resulting behavioral developments such as emotions. They seem to have rebuilt the first Central Power Battery originally destroyed by Hal Jordan (under the influence of Parallax). Henshaw decided not to interfere in the reformation of the Green Lantern Corps after an encounter between a Manhunter and Green Lanterns Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner. =Sinestro Corps= The Manhunters have recently resurfaced as part of the Sinestro Corps. Some of them carry miniature yellow Power Batteries inside them which are used by the Sinestro Corps members to charge their yellow power rings while others still carry the green ones for taking powers from the Green Lanterns' rings. =Secret Origin= In the Green Lantern: Secret Origin storylines (which revises Hal Jordan's beginnings), it is revealed that the Manhunters suffered a programming glitch that caused them to wipe out all life in space sector 666, believing it to be evil. It was this event that gave rise to the Five Inversions, the only survivors of the massacre, who vowed to make the Guardians pay for what their creations had done.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #33 (2008) =Blackest Night= During the events of Blackest Night, it is revealed that Amanda Waller and King Faraday have a deactivated Manhunter in their possession, having recovered it from the Belle Reve swamp after the Millennium event (which the Suicide Squad had a hand in stopping). Waller sends the Manhunter to Belle Reve in order to assist the Secret Six and the Suicide Squad in their battle with members of the Black Lantern Corps. Waller ultimately uses a self-destruct mechanism to destroy the Manhunter, unleashing an explosion of Green Lantern energy that eradicates the Black Lanterns.Secret Six (vol. 3) #18 (2010) =Brightest Day= It was eventually revealed that the programming glitch the Manhunters suffered was caused by Krona to prove to the other Guardians of the Universe that there are flaws in an emotionless police force.Green Lantern #63 =The New 52= While running from the Alpha Lanterns, John Stewart and Guy Gardner find dozens of deactivated Manhunters in the Guardian's Ring Foundry. They re-energize the robots using the Foundry essence in order to fend off the Alphas. However, during the fight, the Manhunters are accidentally fused in a massive bio- mechanic monster.Green Lantern Corps V3 #11 It as since been revealed that the Manhunters were created to apprehend the First Lantern during a time the Maltusians were still trying to harness the Emerald Light of Willpower in the Emotional Spectrum which they eventually would use as a source of energy to fuel their efforts to police the cosmos. Chant The Manhunters have had a mixture of oaths over the years: \\"No evil escapes the Manhunters!\\", \\"Death to the Green Lantern Corps!\\", and \\"No man escapes the Manhunters!\\" Highmaster The Highmaster The Highmaster is the supreme Manhunter which appeared on Orinda in Justice League International #10. He resembles a gigantic yellow manhunter and was destroyed by Hal Jordan and Superman. Technology *Manhunter technology has been used in the creation of the OMAC drones. The Kryptonian technology was incorporated into the Manhunters by Hank Henshaw on Biot, which enabled them to use the Central Power Battery on Oa as a power source for the Manhunters. *Originally the Manhunters used special energy pistols which were charged by the green lanterns which they carried. Other versions =Injustice: Gods Among Us= Manhunter makes an cameo appearance in Injustice: Gods Among Us's prequel comic. In a flashback in chapter seven of Year Two, Sinestro is attacked by a Manhunter, though he easily dispatches it before bringing its body before the Guardians of the Universe. =Star Trek/Green Lantern= In the sequel to Star Trek/Green Lantern: The Spectrum War, a year after the Green Lanterns and their various allies arrived in the new Star Trek timeline, Saint Walker discovers a Manhunter crashed on a distant moon, with the age of the impact damage suggesting that this Manhunter is native to the Trek universe rather than coming from the Lanterns' reality.Star Trek/Green Lantern #1 =Earth One= Hundreds of years prior to the events depicted in Green Lantern: Earth One, the Manhunters wiped out the majority of the Green Lantern Corps and captured the Central Power Battery, which was assumed destroyed. In a reverse of most versions of their origin story, the Manhunters were created by the Guardians of Oa to replace the Corps, who they felt had become too independent. The Manhunters however turned on the Guardians, killing all but a single survivor who fled to an alternate dimension. The Manhunters carved out an empire in the space previously patrolled by the Green Lanterns, centred on Oa. Hal Jordan, an asteroid miner who had stumbled onto a Power Ring was captured and taken to Oa, which the Manhunters had converted into a mine. Jordan was able to find the Central Battery and summon the remaining Ring bearers to Oa. By creating a controlled feedback loop between the Central Battery and their Rings, the Lanterns were able to destroy the majority of the Manhunters, although the surviving Manhunters still pose a significant threat.Green Lantern: Earth One Vol 1 In other media =Television= * The Manhunters have appeared in the Justice League episode \\"In Blackest Night\\" voiced by James Remar. Like their comic counterparts, they were the first before the Green Lantern Corps. However according to the Guardians, \\"they couldn't understand the subtle gradations between good and evil\\" (probably meaning [draconian justice) and as such, they were reprogrammed for other tasks such as hunting and guarding. Though the Manhunters did not overtly express resentment for this demotion, they began secretly plotting their revenge against the Guardians for their perceived betrayal. The Manhunters bring Green Lantern John Stewart to trial on the planet Ajuris 5 for accidentally destroying Ajuris 4. Unknown to everyone else, the planet's destruction was faked by the Manhunters with the help of Kanjar Ro, as part of their plan to overthrow the Oans and take the Corps' power source, which they believe is rightfully theirs. Their gambit successfully draws several unassigned Green Lanterns to testify for John, as well as five of the Guardians away from Oa, leaving Oa's defenses severely weakened when the Manhunters attack in force. The Justice League clears John's name and then aids in defeating the Manhunters, assisted by the Corps. The lead Manhunter manages to absorb the power of the Central Battery, shedding his metallic form and becoming a giant energy being, but John recites the Green Lantern oath while absorbing the energy of the battery, and by extension the Manhunter, into his ring. He then expels the evil of the Manhunter and restores the Central Battery. This was based on the comics story \\"No Man Escapes The Manhunters\\", which appeared in Justice League of America #140-141 (1977). * The Manhunters appear in the Green Lantern: The Animated Series, voiced by Josh Keaton. They are seen as illustrations in the episode \\"Reckoning\\", in walls of glass that detail the history of the Red Lantern Corps, and are noted to have slaughtered Atrocitus' race, leading to his transformation into the first Red Lantern. In the episode \\"Regime Change\\", Hal Jordan presents this information to the Guardians, initially believing it to be a lie. However the Guardians shamefully reveal they were indeed responsible for the creation of the Manhunters, and that the machines had massacred a number of innocent planets due to their inability to interact with emotional beings. The second half of the first season shows the Manhunters are being rebuilt to act as the Anti-Monitor's foot soldiers. According to both the Guardians and the Manhunters themselves, the cause for the destruction was the Manhunters viewing all emotion as the source of evil and thus seeking to exterminate it. =Film= * The Manhunters are mentioned at the end of Green Lantern: Emerald Knights. When the Green Lantern Corps are out to build a new planet, Hal Jordan mentions to Arisia Rrab about how he took on an army of Manhunters, and his only backup was a squirrel. =Video games= * The Manhunters appear in DC Universe Online, voiced by David Jennison. They assist the Sinestro Corps with their fight against the Green Lanterns. Some broken Manhunters were rebuilt into remote fear generators to boost the power of the Sinestro Corps' power rings. * The Manhunters were the main antagonists in Green Lantern: Rise of the Manhunters, which was set in the same continuity as the Green Lantern live-action film, voiced by Fred Tatasciore. They ally with Amon Sur - who resents that his father's ring went to a primitive like Hal Jordan rather than himself - in an attempt to acquire the yellow fear energy that the Guardians have acquired in the distant past and use it as a power source for themselves. * While not making an actual appearance, the Manhunters are mentioned in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham. During a mission on Ysmault, Hal Jordan, Wonder Woman, Batman, Robin and Solomon Grundy stumble upon a shielded door that Jordan suggests must have belonged to the Manhunters in the past, while briefly explaining their origin to Robin. =Miscellaneous= Manhunters are featured in the Smallville Season 11 digital comic based on the TV series.

It belongs to the fantasy genre and was the first fantasy game published by Infocom after the Zork trilogy (it was originally intended to be Zork IV). The game had a parser that understood over 700 words, making it the most advanced interactive fiction game of its time. It was Infocom's ninth game. Plot Krill, an incredibly powerful evil warlock, is spreading chaos and destruction. None of the more experienced members of the Circle of Enchanters dare to attempt to stop him. In desperation, the player, a novice Enchanter with only a few weak spells in his spell book, is sent in hopes that Krill will either fail to detect him or dismiss him as harmless. More powerful spells can be found on scrolls hidden in various locations, but as the player becomes more of a threat, Krill will respond accordingly. This game features an innovative new spell system based partially on Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series and partially Dungeons and Dragons' Vancian spell system, where spells must be prepared through \\"memorization\\" before being cast. As in the Earthsea series, each spell is represented by some nonsense \\"magic word\\" which is treated as a verb by the game's text parser, so that one can use the FROTZ spell (which causes objects to glow and give off light) by typing >FROTZ BOOK, in exactly the same way as one might type >PICK UP BOOK or >READ BOOK. There are references scattered throughout Enchanter's documentation and gameplay comparing the use of spells by mages to the use of command line interfaces by programmers, and comparing mages to hackers in general. Many of the spell names, such as FROTZ and GNUSTO, are taken from MIT hacker slang of the time; others are various pop cultural references or anagrams. (For instance, the NITFOL spell allows one to speak with animals, and NITFOL is a truncated reversal of \\"LOFTING\\", after the author of the Doctor Dolittle stories.) Notes Frotz, a modern open-source interpreter for Infocom games (as well as independently written interactive fiction) draws its name from a spell (\\"cause object to glow with illumination\\") in Enchanter and its sequels. Another spell, Blorb (\\"hide an object in a strongbox\\"), provides the name for a standard wrapper for interactive fiction multimedia resources. Several other IF tools have also been named after spells from the series. In the game Zork III, a device slowly cycles through \\"scenes\\" from each of the Zork games as a number is displayed above it. A depiction of the sacrificial altar from the then-unreleased Enchanter appeared under the number \\"IV\\". Creators Dave Lebling and Marc Blank decided during the game's design that the magic system made it a standalone product. It became the first game of its own trilogy, usually referred to as \\"The Enchanter Trilogy\\". The others in the series are 1984's Sorcerer and 1985's Spellbreaker. Robin Wayne Bailey's 1989 novel Enchanter is a companion rather than a novelisation. Infocom rated Enchanter as \\"Standard\\" in difficulty. Enchanter is the only game in the Zork universe where lurking grues, although they still exist, are not mentioned by name; the game doesn't even know the word \\"grue\\". The game has 17 ways to die. Remake In 1993, about ten years after the original Enchanter, a remake of the game was developed and published by Japanese software development company SystemSoft for the NEC PC-9801, entitled . There are differences in this enhanced remake: the game recognizes verb commands typed in kana (Japanese syllable system) or Latin alphabet. For convenience, some of the most common verb commands (Look, Take, etc.) can be accessed by pressing a corresponding button, but the player still has to type the name of an object. This remake also helps the player to interact with the environment by displaying a list of objects after the player has typed a command. Also, unlike the original, the remake contains enhanced graphics; every location has a unique background picture, on which the text is super-imposed. Reception Released in September, 1983, Infocom sold about 50,000 copies of Enchanter by the end of 1984, and 75,000 over its lifetime or as part of the Enchanter Trilogy. Computer Gaming Worlds Scorpia praised the game as \\"typically excellent\\" and up to the standards expected of Infocom games. Ahoy! wrote that \\"Enchanter is filled with the usual Infocom doses of wit, red herrings ... twists, turns, and surprises\\". It stated that while beginners would enjoy it, experienced text adventure gamers \\"may be disappointed. There didn't seem to be a whole lot to do. I solved the game in record time, for me; it left me wanting more ... The very moniker \\"Infocom\\" may be raising my expectations too high\\". John J. Anderson wrote in Creative Computing, \\"With Enchanter, they have scored again ... Enchanter is full of the delightful little touches we have come to expect from Infocom.\\" Compute! stated that Enchanter had \\"nothing strikingly original about it, but you'll appreciate its high level of challenge and meticulously maintained continuity\\". It stated that \\"some of the humor lacks, well, subtlety\\", citing the name Dimwit Flathead as example, and that \\"the narrative won't win any literary awards, either\\". The magazine concluded that it \\"is an excellent game for adventure freaks\\". Ron Boerger reviewed Enchanter in Space Gamer No. 73. Boerger commented that \\"Enchanter is [...] a lot of fun, and if you're into the all-text, no-picture sort of roleplaying, I heartily recommend it.\\" In 1998, AllGame's Lisa Karen Savignano gave the Apple II version three-and-a- half stars out of five, saying, \\"If you like really hard adventure games with knotty puzzles to unravel, you will like Enchanter. And even if you have trouble, there are always clues to help you.\\" References Further reading * External links View Enchanter packaging at the Gallery of Zork. *Bugs in Enchanter *Enchanter walkthrough 1980s interactive fiction 1983 video games Amiga games Amstrad CPC games Amstrad PCW games Apple II games Atari 8-bit family games Atari ST games Commodore 64 games CP/M games DOS games Fantasy video games Infocom games Mac OS games NEC PC-9801 games Texas Instruments TI-99/4A games TRS-80 games Video games developed in the United States Zork games ","title":"Enchanter (video game)"},{"id":"983935","text":"Amdang (also Biltine; autonym: s√¨m√≠ amdangt√≠) is a language closely related to Fur, which together constitute a branch of the Nilo-Saharan language family.

The State Museum, is located along the banks of the Congaree River in downtown Columbia, South Carolina. It is the largest museum in the state, and is a Smithsonian Affiliate and part of the American Alliance of Museums. Positioned on an old shipping canal (Columbia Canal) that dates back to pre-Civil War times, the museum is widely recognized as a resource for South Carolina history and lifestyle. The museum opened on October 29, 1988 and is housed in what it calls its largest artifact, the former Columbia Mills Building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. When the mill opened in 1894, manufacturing cotton duck cloth (a canvas-like material), it was the first totally electric textile mill in the world. It was also the first major industrial installation for the General Electric corporation. On certain levels of the museum, the original flooring has been kept intact, distinguishable by hundreds of textile brads and rings (that carried the threads during the spinning process) that became embedded in the floor while it was still being used as a mill. The South Carolina Confederate Relic Room & Military Museum is located within the Columbia Mills Building, and is the oldest museum exhibit (est. 1896) in Columbia. The museum represents four disciplines: art, cultural history, science and technology, and natural history. Exhibits include life-size replicas of the Best Friend of Charleston- the first American-built locomotive in 1830; and the Civil War's H.L. Hunley, the first submarine to sink an enemy ship in combat. The second floor on natural history is notable for its recreation of a 3.6 million-year-old Megalodon, named Finn, suspended mid-air just around a corner, which has scared countless groups of young children, and for a life-size Columbian mammoth (which was once native to SC). There is also the Lipscomb art gallery on the first floor, which features an iron gate made by Charleston's Philip Simmons. And there is the Cotton Mill Exchange gift shop with South Carolina souvenirs and books. The museum has the Crescent Caf√© with sandwiches. The museum has a 1989 mural of the nearby Gervais Street Bridge by Columbia's Blue Sky (artist) in a room next to the Caf√©. It has topiary sculpted by Bishopville's Pearl Fryar in the parking lot. The Stringer Discovery Center for small children opened in 1997. The museum has an \\"Official\\" Story Chair (named Sammy) designed and donated by Storyteller Mike Miller (greatstoryteller.com) for the benefit of children and storytellers.

There is a reference in chapter 4 verse 36, to Jeremiel (in the Latin Ieremihel), which, however, does not occur in all the manuscripts. Other versions have Remihel, Oriel or Uriel.Robert Weber (ed.) Biblia Sacra juxta Vulgatam Versionem, Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart, 1969 In this passage the angel or angels (Uriel is also there) are answering Ezra's many questions about heaven and hell. Jeremiel (under any of his name alterations: Eremiel, Remiel, Remihel, etc.) had a very dour yet comforting duty in the pre- Christian eras. He was set over Sheol (the underworld) in Abrahamic tradition, in particular the \\"Bosom of Abraham\\", a region of the underworld almost identical in concept to the Greek idea of Elysium. Here Jeremiel was responsible for placating the righteous souls awaiting the Lord who resided there. In the post-Christian world Jeremiel's duty evolved and is paired with St. Simon Peter as gatekeeper of Heaven. In both cases Jeremiel watches over and guides the holy deceased in their afterlife journey. There are generally seven archangels venerated by the Orthodox Christians: Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Selathiel, Jegudiel, and Barachiel. But sometimes they also add an eighth, Jeremiel, to this number. He is depicted holding balance scales in Orthodox iconography. In the Apocalypse of Zephaniah, an apocryphal book which has come down to us in Coptic, the angel referred to as Eremiel tells Zephaniah > I am the great angel, Eremiel, who is over the abyss and Hades, the one in > which all of the souls are imprisoned from the end of the Flood, which came > upon the earth, until this dayThe Apocalypse of Zephaniah, section 7, in > Charlesworth, volume 1 In two or three places in the Book of Enoch, available in Ethiopic, there are lists of angels.

A small portion of the zoo extends into the nearby city of West Columbia. It is operated by the Rich-Lex Riverbanks Park Special Purpose District, a partnership of the city of Columbia and Richland and Lexington counties. It is overseen by the Riverbanks Park Commission, comprising two members each from the three governments and one at-large member. Riverbanks Zoo and Garden is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). History In the early 1960s, Columbia-area businessmen conceived of a zoo for the state capital. However, the idea didn't get beyond the planning stages until 1969, when the state created the Rich-Lex Riverbanks Park Special Purpose District to run the proposed zoo. The zoo opened on April 25, 1974 after 5 years of planning. Within two years, it was obvious that the zoo would not be self- supporting, and the Riverbanks Zoological Society was created to help raise money for it. At the same time, Palmer \\"Satch\\" Krantz was appointed executive director. Notable features of the original Zoo design were the mountainous, moated exhibits for big cats and bears. Riverbanks Zoo and Garden is South Carolina's largest gated attraction, averaging over one million visitors each year‚Äîa considerable amount for a zoo serving a region as small as Columbia (the Columbia metropolitan area has only 800,000 people). Riverbanks is a four-time winner of the Southeastern Tourism Society's Shining Example Award as the Southeast's top tourist attraction and a two-time winner of the SC Parks Recreation and Tourism Governor's Cup Award as South Carolina's Leading Attraction. Animals and exhibits A giraffe being fed at an overlook in 'Africa Plains'. A male lion at Riverbanks The zoo is home to over 2,000 animals, with collections of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. In 2002, additions included exhibits for African elephants, gorillas, and koalas. The Birdhouse at Riverbanks (opened 2001) was given a Significant Achievement Award by the AZA as one of the best new zoo exhibits in the United States, and features a display of king, rockhopper, and gentoo penguins. The Zoo 2002 plan cost $15 million. African Plains is a exhibit featuring giraffe, Grant's zebra, and ostrich. In the 90s, the zoo had a hippo and rhinos. The Aquarium Reptile Complex (opened in 1989 as part of the Zoo II plan) is a building with a tank for Pacific coral reef species, as well as exhibits for Galapagos tortoises, false gharials, Komodo dragons, and other reptiles. There is a Galapagos tortoise sculpture next to it. Opened in 2002, Ndoki Forest was designed to house two of the larger African species, the African elephant and western lowland gorilla, as well as de Brazza's monkey, slender-tailed meerkat, and various birds. The elephants once lived in a renovated yard with a pool. As of November 20, 2019 the last elephant was transported to the Milwaukee County Zoo in Wisconsin. The closing of the elephant exhibit made room for a White Southern Rhino exhibit, opened in Summer of 2020. Riverbanks Farm (opened in 1988) contains domestic animals and allows guests to feed the zoo's goats and llamas. Lemur Island is an exhibit including ring-tailed lemurs and red ruffed lemurs. Conservation Outpost has threatened species such as howler monkeys, fishing cats, and tree kangaroos. In 1983, the Education Center opened for Zoo Camp. Kangaroo Walkabout is another recent addition. It has a path leading into the exhibit where visitors can view wallabies and red kangaroos without a barrier between them. However, visitors cannot stray from the path. The Riverbanks Zoo has added a Malayan tapir on January 18, 2013, and a breeding pair of babirusas in 2012. The babirusas have successfully been bred and can be found in the previous warthog exhibit. In June 2016 a new Sea lion exhibit was opened, which is modeled after San Francisco's Pier 39. Around that time the newly renovated Entrance, renovated otter exhibit, and renovated grizzly bear exhibit also opened. This was all part of the zoo's $36 million Destination Riverbanks plan. Separate exhibits include hamadryas baboons, lions, Siberian tigers, meerkats, alligators, and siamangs. The last original animal who had been there since the zoo's opening, a female Caribbean flamingo, died in March 2014. The Birmingham Zoo's western lowland gorilla, Cenzoo was sent to this zoo in late February 2015 to breed with a female gorilla from North Carolina Zoo and two more female gorillas from Zoo Atlanta as part of the recommendation of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Species Survival Plan. https://www.riverbanks.org/media-center/general- info/history Botanical garden Riverbanks also has a botanical garden (opened on June 10, 1995 at the cost of $6 million) with more than 4,200 species of native and exotic plants, and some sculptures.

Located near the Loire River, the city is famous for its cathedral, for a kind of lentil, for its lace-making,Article in informational website as well as for being the origin of the Chemin du Puy, one of the principal origin points of the pilgrimage route of Santiago de Compostela in France. In 2017, the commune had a population of 18,995. History Le Puy-en-Velay was a major bishopric by the early period of medieval France. Its foundation is largely legendary. According to a martyrology compiled by Ado of Vienne, published in many copies in 858, and supplemented in the mid-10th century by Gauzbert of Limoges,Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"Le Puy\\" a priest named George accompanied a certain Front, the first Bishop of P√©rigueux, when they were sent to proselytize in Gaul. Front was added to the list of the apostles to Gaul, who in tradition are described as being sent out to reorganize Christians after the persecutions that are associated with Decius, circa 250. As with others of the group, notably Saint Martial of Limoges, later mythology pushed the activities of Saint Front and the priest George back in time. It tells that George had been restored to life with a touch of Saint Peter's staff. The expanding legend of this St. George, which, according to the Church historian Duchesne is not earlier than the 11th century, then makes that saint one of the Seventy Apostles of the Gospel of Luke. It tells that he founded the church of the [civitas] que dicitur Vetula in pago Vellavorum, the city \\"called Vetula in the pays of the Vellavi\\" was how a document of 1004 termed it. This was what the settlement of Ruessium began to be called during the 4th century.Lauranson-Rosaz, note 89 Vetula means \\"the old woman\\", and pagans were still making small images of her as late as the 6th century in Flanders, according to the vita of Saint Eligius. This was the first cathedral at Le Puy. Saint Michel d'Aiguilhe Chapel. Following St. George the founder, later medieval local traditions evoke a legendary list of bishops at this chief town of the pays of Le Velay: Macarius, Marcellinus, Roricius, Eusebius, Paulianus, and Vosy (Evodius), all of them canonized by local veneration. The Gaulish settlement of Ruessium/Vellavorum was given its Christianizing name, Saint- Paulien, from Bishop Paulianus. A bishop Evodius attended the Council of Valence in 374. In the early 1180s peasants of Le Puy, led by a carpenter named Durandus, formed a conspiratio (sworn association) called the Capucciati (because of the white hoods they wore as a sign of their conspiratio). They challenged seigneurial dominance in a short-lived attempt at reformation. =Our Lady of Le Puy= Cath√©drale Notre-Dame du Puy and the city. The Christianization legends of Mons Anicius relate that at the request of Bishop Martial of Limoges, Bishop Evodius/Vosy ordered an altar to the Virgin Mary to be erected on the pinnacle that surmounts Mont Anis. Some such beginning of the shrine Christianized the pagan site; it later became the altar site of the cathedral of Le Puy. This marked one starting-point for the pilgrim route to Santiago de Compostela, a walk of some 1600 km, as it still does today. The old town of Le Puy developed around the base of the cathedral. Pilgrims were early visitors to Le Puy, and it was the most popular destination in France during the Middle Ages. Charlemagne came twice, in 772 and 800. There is a legend that in 772, he established a foundation at the cathedral for ten poor canons (chanoines de paup√©rie), and he chose Le Puy, with Aachen and Saint- Gilles, as a center for the collection of Peter's Pence. Other notable medieval visitors to Le Puy were Charles the Bald in 877, Odo, count of Paris in 892, Robert II in 1029, and Philip Augustus in 1183. Louis IX met James I of Aragon here in 1245, and in 1254, when passing through Le Puy on his return from the Holy Land, he gave the cathedral an ebony image of the Blessed Virgin clothed in gold brocade. She is one of the many dozens of venerable \\"Black Virgins\\" of France. It was destroyed during the Revolution, but replaced at the Restoration with a copy that continues to be venerated. After him, Le Puy was visited by Philip the Bold in 1282, by Philip the Fair in 1285, by Charles VI in 1394, by Charles VII in 1420, and by Isabelle Rom√©e, the mother of Joan of Arc, in 1429. Louis XI made the pilgrimage in 1436 and 1475, and in 1476 halted three leagues from the city and walked barefoot to the cathedral. Charles VIII visited it in 1495, Francis I in 1533. The legendary ancient shrine on the summit of Mons Anicius, which drew so many, would seem to predate the founding of an early church of Our Lady of Le Puy at Anicium. It was attributed to Bishop Vosy, who transferred the episcopal see from Ruessium to Anicium. Crowning the hill was a megalithic dolmen. A local tradition rededicated the curative virtue of the sacred site to Mary, who healed ailments when a person touched the standing stone. When the founding bishop Vosy climbed the hill, he found that it was snow-covered in July; in the snowfall the tracks of a deer around the dolmen outlined the foundations of the future church.Snow in July would have been a likely feature of the post- volcanic summer of 535 and 536; the intervention of the deer may be compared to the legends attached to Saints Eustache and Hubert. The Bishop was apprised in a vision that the angels themselves had dedicated the future cathedral to the Blessed Virgin, whence the epithet \\"Angelic\\" given to the cathedral of Le Puy. The great dolmen was left standing in the center of the Christian sanctuary, which was constructed around it; the stone was re-consecrated as the Throne of Mary. By the 8th century, however, the stone, popularly known as the \\"stone of visions\\", was taken down and broken up. Its pieces were incorporated into the floor of a particular section of the church that came to be called the Chambre Ang√©lique, or the \\"angels' chamber.\\" It is impossible to say whether this St. Evodius is the same person who signed the decrees of the Council of Valence in 374. Neither can it be affirmed that St. Benignus, who in the 7th century founded a hospital at the gates of the basilica, and St. Agrevius, the 7th-century martyr from whom the town of Saint-Agr√®ve Chiniacum took its name, were really bishops. Duchesne thinks that the chronology of these early bishops rests on very little evidence and that very ill-supported by documents. Before the 10th century, only six individuals are known of whom it can be said with certainty that they were bishops of Le Puy. The first of these, Scutarius, the legendary architect of the first cathedral, dates from the end of the 4th century according to an inscription that notes his name.. Adhemar, bishop of Le Puy was a central figure in the First Crusade. Pope Clement IV was also bishop of Le Puy. Though the ancient diocese was suppressed by the Concordat of 1801, it was re-erected in 1823. Climate Le Puy features an oceanic climate (Cfb) with strong warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb) influences. Winters are cold to very cold with some snow. Summers are pleasantly warm but not hot. Summer nights are always cool, and sometimes, cold. On 5 March 2005, temperature dipped to an extremely cold ‚àí22 ¬∞C. Population Sights Notre-Dame de France Le Puy-en-Velay's most striking attraction is the Cath√©drale Notre-Dame du Puy, dating chiefly from the first half of the 12th century. The fa√ßade, striped in courses of white sandstone and black volcanic breccia, is reached by a flight of sixty steps, and consists of three orders, the lowest composed of three high arcades opening into the porch, which extends beneath the first bays of the nave. Above it are three central windows that light the nave, and above them are three gables on the gable-end of the nave, flanked by two openwork screening gables. The south transept doorway is sheltered by a Romanesque porch. Behind the choir rises a separate Romanesque bell-tower in seven storeys. The bays of the nave are roofed by octagonal cupolas, the cupola at the crossing forming a lantern; the choir and transepts are barrel vaulted. The striking parti- colored cloister is connected to remains of 13th-century fortifications that separated the cathedral precincts from the rest of the city. Near the cathedral, the 11th-century baptistery of St John is built on Roman foundations. The iron statue of Notre-Dame de France (The Virgin Mary) overlooking the town was designed by the French sculptor Jean-Marie Bonnassieux, and is made from 213 Russian cannons taken in the Siege of Sevastopol (1854‚Äì1855).\\"Le Puy\\", Marist Places It was presented to the town on 12 September 1860 in front of 120,000 people. Three miles from Le Puy are the ruins of the Ch√¢teau de Polignac, one of the most important feudal strongholds. Each morning, pilgrims gather to be blessed before starting their journey to Santiago de Compostela. The cathedral has been a Unesco World Heritage Site since 1998, as part of the \\"Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France\\". Fountain Crozatier is also a noted site in the centre of the town.

The lentils, grown on the thin soils of the area, are very small and almost black in colour. Their unique quality and flavour derive from their high protein and relatively low carbohydrate content. They are widely used in soups and also to accompany goose, duck and sausage dishes. Le Puy green lentil (Lentille Verte du Puy) is an appellation recognised throughout the European Union (Protected Designation of Origin). Noteworthy events =Catholic Jubilee= The town holds a jubilee in years when the feast of the Annunciation falls on Good Friday. The Jubilee of Le Puy (see Jubil√® du Puy-en-Velay in the French Wikipedia) occurred last in 2005 and 2016, but the next occurrence will not be until 2157. The Jubilee of Le Puy is the oldest aside from those of Rome and Jerusalem, taking its original cue from the statement of a monk Bernhard who predicted the end of the world in 992 when the feast of the Annunciation would fall on Good Friday. The number of pilgrims to Le Puy was so remarkable that, after the dread date had safely passed, Pope John XV declared that each such date would be marked by a Jubilee. The first such anniversary occurred in 1065. In the Jubilee of 1407, the press of the crowd was so great that two hundred pilgrims suffocated. Of three Jubilees in the 20th century, the Jubilee of 1932 attracted over 300,000 pilgrims. =Tour de France= Le Puy has hosted the Tour de France on six occasions. In 1954, it was the finish town of stage 15, from Millau, which was won by Dominique Forlini. The next day, Jean Forestier won the race from Le Puy to Lyon. The race did not return until 1990, when the riders retraced their predecessors' route to Millau. Marino Lejarreta won the day. In 1996 the town again hosted two stages, stage 12 from Valence, won by Pascal Richard, and stage 13 to Super-Besse, won by Rolf S√∏rensen.

Before 1996 it was classified in genus Dacrydium or Lagarostrobos, but has recently been recognised as a distinct genus; some botanists still treat it in Lagarostrobos on the basis that it is not phylogenetically distinct from that genus. In molecular phylogenetic analyses Manoao was found to be related to Parasitaxus (a parasitic and monotypic genus from New Caledonia) and Lagarostrobos (a single species from Tasmania when narrowly defined), but their exact relationships are unresolved.

While both of Key's first two previous works, Kanon and Air, had been released first as adult games and then censored for the younger market, Clannad was released with a rating for all ages. It was later ported to the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch consoles. An English version for Windows was released on Steam by Sekai Project in 2015. The story follows the life of Tomoya Okazaki, from adolescence to adulthood. As an average high school student, he meets many people in his last year at school, including five girls whose individual problems he helps resolve, and his life is further detailed after graduating from high school. The gameplay of Clannad follows a plot that branches into different scenarios based on various courses of interaction by the player character. The game was ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. Key went on to produce an adult spin-off titled Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life in November 2005, which expanded on the scenario of Tomoyo Sakagami, one of the five heroines from Clannad. Clannad has made several transitions to other media. There have been four manga adaptations published by ASCII Media Works, Flex Comix, Fujimi Shobo and Jive. Comic anthologies, light novels and art books have also been published, as have audio dramas and several albums of music. An animated film by Toei Animation was released in September 2007, followed by two anime series including two original video animation (OVA) episodes by Kyoto Animation produced between 2007 and 2009. Both anime series and their accompanying OVAs are licensed by Sentai Filmworks and were released in North America in 2009. The animated adaptations have received high sales figures in Japan as well as critical acclaim abroad. Gameplay Average dialogue and narrative in Clannad depicting the main character Tomoya talking to Nagisa. Clannad is a drama and romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Tomoya Okazaki. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Clannad follows a branching plot line with multiple endings; depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are six main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, five which are initially available. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player must replay the game multiple times and make different choices to change the plot progression. When first playing the game, the scenarios for all five heroines and additional smaller scenarios are available in what is called the School Life story arc. When the player completes a character's scenario, he or she receives an orb of light. When eight of these lights are obtained, the game's second story arc, called After Story, is made available. One of the lights disappears during School Life, but reappears in After Story. To view the true ending of Clannad, all 13 lights must be obtained. Originally, the lights were meant to be items that players could use in the game, but since this increased the game's complexity, and detracted from the storyline, the function of the lights was simplified and made less intrusive. Plot =Setting and themes= The first half of the story takes place primarily at Hikarizaka Private High School, a fictional school located in Japan. Outside of the school, frequented locations include the bakery run by Nagisa's parents, and the dormitory where Youhei Sunohara lives. Throughout the story, glimpses into an Illusionary World are shown. This world is devoid of all life except for a young girl, though she later makes a body out of junk pieces through which the player can interact with her. The remaining half of the story takes place in the same city, after the conclusion of the first half. While the town's name was never directly mentioned, one can infer that the town's name is Hikarizaka based on the many companies and establishments that share this name. There are recurring themes that appear throughout the story. The main theme is the value of having a family, as the title of the series implies because the main scenario writer Jun Maeda mistakenly thought the name of the Irish band Clannad meant \\"clan\\" or \\"family\\" in Irish. Of the six main characters, Tomoya, Nagisa, and Kotomi have no siblings, though their parents are major factors in their stories. Nagisa's story was written to incorporate what Maeda described as a \\"perfect family\\" with a focus on mental consciousness. In Nagisa's story, there is a recurring appearance of (a fictional group mascot for children) that Nagisa is fond of. Tomoya's and Nagisa's characters were written in a style to exemplify a \\"growth to adulthood\\" by the end of the story. Fuko's and Kyou's stories have their sisters playing an integral part, and Tomoyo's story is influenced by her entire family. A minor motif of Irish words continues with the opening theme of the game, \\"Mag Mell\\", which means roughly \\"plain of joy\\" and is connected with Irish mythology. The arrange album, a short music CD that contained remixed versions of songs in the game, that was bundled with the original game release was titled Mabinogi, which was a collection of prose stories from medieval Welsh manuscripts. =Main characters= The player assumes the role of Tomoya Okazaki, the protagonist of Clannad. Tomoya has been labeled a delinquent; at the beginning of the story, he even expresses hatred toward the city he has lived in all his life where Clannad is set. He is very straightforward in his comments to others and will not hesitate to speak his mind, even if he comes off as rude during such times. Despite this, Tomoya is loyal to his friends, and has been known to dedicate himself for those around him in need of help or support. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them. Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa, the main heroine of Clannad, at the onset of the story. Nagisa is a shy girl who has an illness which causes her to rely on those around her for support. She has developed the strange habit of muttering the names of favorite foods that she plans to eat as a way to motivate herself, such as anpan. Kyou Fujibayashi, another of Clannad heroines, is a loud, aggressive girl well known as a good cook among her friends and family. When angry she does not hesitate to throw a dictionary at people that she often carries around for such purposes. Despite this attitude, she also has a more subdued side, especially towards her younger fraternal twin sister Ryou Fujibayashi. Tomoya meets a genius girl named Kotomi Ichinose, one day in the school library. She is ranked in the top 10 throughout the whole country in standardized exam results of every subject‚Äîshe always goes to library to read extra materials, especially books in foreign languages. Kotomi is a quiet girl with poor social skills and it is quite difficult to communicate with her; Kotomi can even completely ignore someone when reading, even if they make loud disturbances around her. Clannad fourth heroine is a second-year student named Tomoyo Sakagami who transfers into Tomoya's school. Tomoyo is known to be a strong fighter, preferring to use kicking over punching, and is athletic. Although Tomoya is older than her, Tomoyo does not show him respect as a senior student. Tomoyo appears in Key's fifth game, Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life, as the main heroine. The last heroine in Clannad is a first-year student named Fuko Ibuki who is eccentric and childish, before she met Tomoya, was generally seen alone by herself making wood carvings of starfish with a small knife to give to others as presents. Fuko is extremely enthralled by starfish, or things that are star- shaped, and will often go into short euphoric bouts where her awareness of her surroundings is completely overtaken. =Story= Clannad story revolves around Tomoya Okazaki, a third year high school student who dislikes his life. Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, while arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya against the window, dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him to distance himself from others. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay out all night. Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much. The story opens on Monday April 14, 2003 at the beginning of the school year, when Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa, a soft-spoken girl who is one year older than he is but is repeating her last year in high school due to being sick much of the previous year. Her goal is to join the drama club which she was unable to do due to her sickness, but they find that the drama club was disbanded after the few remaining members graduated. Since Tomoya has a lot of time to kill, he helps Nagisa in reforming the drama club. During this period, Tomoya meets and hangs out with several other girls whom he gets to know well and help with their individual problems. After Story In the second part of the story, which starts immediately after the end of the first part but extends into the next seven years, Tomoya and Nagisa start living together, and eventually get married. Tomoya has to endure several hardships that the family has been suffering from, especially Nagisa's illness. Just after Nagisa gives birth to their daughter Ushio, she dies, which causes Tomoya to become severely depressed. He is barely able to function, let alone look after an infant. As a result, Nagisa's parents, Akio and Sanae, take care of their granddaughter. Five years later, Tomoya meets with Shino Okazaki, his paternal grandmother. Shino tells Tomoya of his father's traumatic past, which is eerily similar to Tomoya's current situation. Afterwards, Tomoya resolves to raise Ushio and acknowledges Naoyuki as his father. Shortly after Tomoya overcomes his depression, Ushio is stricken with the same disease that Nagisa had. Tomoya, Sanae and Akio struggle to save her‚ÄîTomoya even quits his job‚Äîbut all of their efforts turn out to be in vain. In the coming winter, wanting to do anything for his daughter, Tomoya takes her on a trip, but she dies shortly after. Tomoya's psychology is developed in his dreams of a bleak world, called the , where small orbs of light float around. In the first few dreams, he sees a world devoid of all life, except for one girl. Each time he dreams, he finds out more about the world. Tomoya discovers that the girl has a special ability to fuse junk together to create new things, which she uses to create a body for him. Over time, Tomoya comes to the conclusion that only the two of them are \\"alive\\". To pass time, Tomoya and the girl try to build another doll with more junk they find, but as it has no soul, it fails to come to life. Remembering the distant world where he came from, Tomoya convinces the girl to build a ship so that the two can escape the approaching winter and continue to live a happy life. Eventually, winter sets in, and the girl becomes cold to the point where she cannot move any more. The girl tells Tomoya that he has another chance to go back and make things right. To do so, he must collect certain \\"lights\\" (symbols of happiness) similar to those floating around in the Illusionary World. If all the \\"lights\\" are collected throughout both story parts, a chance to save Nagisa from dying will become available, as well as the true ending, where she survives and lives with Tomoya and Ushio. Development The executive producer for Clannad was Takahiro Baba from Visual Arts, the publishing company which controls Key. Jun Maeda, who was one of three main scenario writers with Kai, and Y≈´ichi Suzumoto, led the planning for Clannad and wrote the majority of the scenarios. Scenario assistance was provided by T≈çya Okano. Itaru Hinoue headed the art direction, and also worked on the character design. Miracle Mikipon, Mochisuke, Na-Ga, and Shinory supplemented the computer graphics. Torino provided the background art. The game's music was composed by Maeda, Shinji Orito, and Magome Togoshi. For Key's second visual novel Air, Maeda admitted he felt he was able to write what he wanted to for the game's scenario, but he later discovered that Air was difficult for players to receive and experience. Due to this, Maeda felt that for Key's next work Clannad, he had a sense of duty to make the game easier to receive for as many users as possible. In any case, he wanted to make it an entertaining game, and started planning on Clannad almost immediately after Airs completion. From the start of Clannads planning, Maeda did not want to write a story like in Air, but instead wanted to focus on writing a deep connection between the 'people and the town', and 'humanity'. Maeda noted that he exceeded his writing ability when writing most of the scenarios in Clannad, and equates Clannads writing process as a \\"wall that I will never be able to get over again.\\" While at the beginning Maeda felt he was prepared, the entire game's story started to increase to a level Maeda never predicted, and Suzumoto noted that it approximately doubled in size from the original projected length. Suzumoto attributed the increase due to the lengthening structure of the game's base scenario which caused the 'branch' scenarios to increase as well. There were more concerns about Clannad being similar to Air. When Nagisa's scenario was being written, there were some disputes concerning the length of her scenario, and thus putting too much focus on the main heroine. Some were concerned that having a single prominent character with a unique storyline would be too much like how Air was structured with the overall focus on Misuzu Kamio. Takahiro Baba, the company president of VisualArt's, is even noted as suggesting to minimize the differences between the other characters' scenarios, but this was ultimately ignored since Maeda thought the game's evaluation by players would not decrease on account of the scenarios being vastly different, and thought the end result was a good one. Maeda was concerned that the After Story arc, mainly a continuation of Nagisa's scenario, would eclipse the entire game's scenario, much like what happened with Air according to Maeda. In order to prevent the same thing happening in Clannad, Maeda focused on making the first half of the story, the School Life arc, just as enjoyable by making it long and heart-breaking. Clannad is Key's second longest work, as reported by Y≈´to Tonokawa where he stated that Clannad is about 4,000 words fewer than Key's 2008 game Little Busters! Ecstasy. =Release history= Key announced in 2001 a release date of 2002 for Clannad and, after several postponements, Clannad was released on April 28, 2004 as a limited edition version, playable on a Windows PC as a DVD.

This is where time truly starts to fly by, lending the show some real weight in the emotional departments.\\" Theron Martin of Anime News Network gave the first season a 'B+' rating, criticizing its extensive use of moe elements, but considered it appealing entertainment for a \\"fan base who revels in this kind of thing.\\" His review for the second season After Story was much more positive, giving it an 'A-' rating.

Players of either game who had a character over level 20 could enter a lottery where 500 people were chosen to win Clannad-related goods which included virtual and real-world items such as file folders, \\"netcash\\" cards, sports towels, tapestries, and various items used during gameplay. ASCII Media Works and Vridge produced the PlayStation 2 visual novel based on the light novel series Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. Released in September 2008, the game features the series' characters cosplaying in various costumes either depicting characters from five popular light novel series published by ASCII Media Works, or three Clannad heroines. Haruka Nogizaka can cosplay as Kotomi Ichinose, Mika Nogizaka can cosplay as Nagisa Furukawa (albeit with long hair), and Shiina Amamiya can cosplay as Tomoyo Sakagami. The player can also view exclusive CGs in the game if one of the girls is taken out to various places while cosplaying as one of the aforementioned five light novel series characters, or as the Clannad heroines. For example, if Mika is cosplaying as Nagisa, a CG of her eating dango can become viewable. When cosplaying as one of these tie-in characters, the voice of the girl cosplaying changes to the voice actress of the character they are cosplaying; for example, if Shiina cosplays as Tomoyo, she is voiced by Tomoyo's voice actress Houko Kuwashima. A 3D virtual world called Ai Sp@ce was developed by the video game developer Headlock where users can interact with bish≈çjo game heroines from Clannad, Shuffle!, and Da Capo II. Released in October 2008, the world recreates each game franchise on its own virtual island which are linked with a central Akihabara Island where users can interact, bridging the gap between the separate franchises. Users are able to create a customizable avatar to represent themselves in the game, along with choosing one game heroine to live with, which is referred to as a character doll, or chara-doll for short. The user and chara-doll reside together on one of the three in-game \\"islands\\" depending on which franchise the heroine is from, which includes a house with furniture and clothes that can be purchased. The chara-dolls can also be customizable in that they can develop a unique personality for each user.

She was built by Wigram, Wells and Green and launched at Woolwich on 21 February 1814. She was built of pitch-pine, which made for speedy construction at the expense of durability. Her major service was on the East Indies Station from where in 1819 she led the successful punitive campaign against the Al Qasimi, a belligerent naval power based in Ras Al Khaimah which the British considered to be piratical. She was sold in 1822 but continued to operate in the Persian Gulf for an indefinite period thereafter. Service Liverpool was commissioned under Captain Arthur Farquhar in May 1814. Her first commission was very brief, though. She escorted convoys to Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and Quebec. She then served at the Cape Station before returning to Deptford to be paid off on 3 April 1816. First, though, she captured the French schooner Circonstance on 21 October 1815. Circonstance was carrying 67 slaves. On 5 Match 1816, Liverpool was driven ashore and severely damaged at Dover, Kent, England. She was later refloated and taken in to The Downs. In 1817 she was laid up at Deptford. In 1818, Liverpool was re-commissioned under Captain Francis Augustus Collier. He sailed her to join the East Indies Station, sailing via Mauritius and Trincomalee. While at Port Louis she captured four slave vessels. In the middle of 1819 she captured Deux Amis (29 July), Constance (17 August) and Jenny (24 August). Bounty money was paid for the freed slaves.  Persian Gulf campaign of 1819  Rear Admiral King appointed Captain Collier of Liverpool to command the naval portion of a joint navy-army punitive expedition against the Al Qasimi at Ras Al Khaimah in the Persian Gulf. The naval force consisted of Liverpool, , , and a number of gun and mortar boats. The Bombay Marine of the East India Company contributed six armed vessels: the 16-gun Teignmouth under the command of Captain Hall, the senior captain, the 16-gun Benares, the 14-gun , the 14-gun , the 12-gun , and the 12-gun .The United service magazine, Vol. 141, pp.77-81. Later two frigates and 600 men belonging to the Sultan of Muscat joined the expedition. On the army side, Major General Sir William Keir commanded some 3,000 troops in transports, including the 47th and 65th Regiments of Foot, the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of Native Infantry, the flank companies of the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of Native Infantry and of the Marine Battalion, and half a company of Pioneers. In all, 1,645 European and 1,424 Indian soldiers ('sepoys') and marines took part in the expedition. The fleet anchored off Ras Al Khaimah on 2 December, landing troops two miles south of the town on 3 December. Collier placed Captain Walpole of Curlew in charge of the gun boats and an armed pinnace to protect the landing, which was, however, unopposed.United service magazine Part 1, pp. 711‚Äì15. The bombardment of the town commenced on 6 December, from landed batteries of 12 pound guns and mortars as well as from sea. On 7 December, two 24-pound cannon from Liverpool were added to the land batteries. When the troops stormed the town on 9 December they found that the inhabitants had all fled. The siege cost the British five dead and 52 men wounded. The Al Qasimi reportedly had lost a thousand dead. On the fall of Ras Al Khaimah, three ships were sent to blockade the nearby harbour at Rams, to the North. They landed a force on 18 December, which fought its way inland through date plantations to the hilltop fort of Dhayah on the 19th. There, 398 men and another 400 women and children held out, without water or effective cover from the sun, for three days under heavy fire until the two 24-pound cannon from Liverpool were once again pressed into use. After enduring two hours of fire from the big guns, which breached the fort's walls, the last of the Al Qasimi surrendered at 10.30 on the morning of the 22nd. The expeditionary force then blew up the town of Ras Al Khaimah and established a garrison there of 800 sepoys and artillery, before visiting Jazirat Al Hamra, which was found to be deserted. They went on to destroy the fortifications and larger vessels of Umm Al Qawain, Ajman, Fasht, Sharjah, Abu Hail, and Dubai. Ten vessels that had taken shelter in Bahrain were also destroyed. The Royal Navy suffered no casualties during the action. The action was to result in the signing of the General Maritime Treaty of 1820, the first treaty between the British and the Sheikhs of what was formerly known as the Pirate Coast and what would become known as the Trucial Coast. The area is known today as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Fate Liverpool carried on serving in the East Indies Station and made a trip to China under Collier. Collier then transferred to , a newly built vessel, and brought her home, arriving on 16 October 1820.Marshall (1830), Supplement, Part 4, pp.223-5. Liverpool returned to the Persian Gulf in August 1821, where she lost a number of her crew to the heat. She was paid off at Bombay in January 1822. Liverpools captain, officers and crew then transferred to the newly built and sailed her back to Spithead, arriving on 6 October 1822.Marshall (1827), Supplement, Part 1, p.365. Liverpool was sold at Bombay on 16 April 1822 for ¬£3,780. The buyer apparently was a Persian prince who wanted to use her to suppress piracy in the Persian Gulf.

The squadron's mission was an early form of \\"flag waving\\" to display British naval power and prowess across the world. This squadron, known as the \\"Flying Squadron\\" consisted of HM ships Barrosa, Endymion, Liffey, Liverpool, Phoebe and Scylla.

(stylized as What t–Ωƒì #$*! DÃÑ”© œâŒ£ (k)œÄow!? and What the #$*! Do We Know!?) is a 2004 American pseudo-scientific film that posits a spiritual connection between quantum physics and consciousness. The plot follows the fictional story of a photographer, using documentary-style interviews and computer-animated graphics, as she encounters emotional and existential obstacles in her life and begins to consider the idea that individual and group consciousness can influence the material world. Her experiences are offered by the filmmakers to illustrate the film's scientifically-unsupported thesis about quantum physics and consciousness. Bleep was conceived and its production funded by William Arntz, who co- directed the film along with Betsy Chasse and Mark Vicente; all three were students of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment. A moderately low-budget independent film, it was promoted using viral marketing methods and opened in art-house theaters in the western United States, winning several independent film awards before being picked up by a major distributor and eventually grossing over $10 million. The 2004 theatrical release was succeeded by a substantially changed, extended home media version in 2006. The film has been described as an example of quantum mysticism, and has been criticized for both misrepresenting science and containing pseudoscience. While many of its interviewees and subjects are professional scientists in the fields of physics, chemistry, and engineering, one of them has noted that the film quotes him out of context. Synopsis Filmed in Portland, Oregon, What the Bleep Do We Know!? presents a viewpoint of the physical universe and human life within it, with connections to neuroscience and quantum physics. Some ideas discussed in the film are: * That the universe is best seen as constructed from thoughts and ideas rather than from matter. * That \\"empty space\\" is not empty. * That matter is not solid, and electrons are able to pop in and out of existence without it being known where they disappear to. * That beliefs about who one is and what is real are a direct cause of oneself and of one's own realities. * That peptides produced by the brain can cause a bodily reaction to emotion. In the narrative segments of the film, Marlee Matlin portrays Amanda, a photographer who plays the role of everywoman as she experiences her life from startlingly new and different perspectives. In the documentary segments of the film, interviewees discuss the roots and meaning of Amanda's experiences. The comments focus primarily on a single theme: \\"We create our own reality.\\" The director, William Arntz, has described What the Bleep as a film for the \\"metaphysical left\\".

Collins as Mother of the Bride Production Work was split between Toronto-based Mr. X Inc., Lost Boys Studios in Vancouver, and Atomic Visual Effects in Cape Town, South Africa. The visual-effects team, led by Evan Jacobs, worked closely with the other film-makers to create visual metaphors that would capture the essence of the film's technical subjects with attention to aesthetic detail. Promotion Lacking the funding and resources of the typical Hollywood film, the filmmakers relied on \\"guerrilla marketing\\" first to get the film into theaters, and then to attract audiences. This has led to accusations, both formal and informal, directed towards the film's proponents, of spamming online message boards and forums with many thinly veiled promotional posts. Initially, the film was released in only two theaters: one in Yelm, Washington (the home of the producers, which is also the home of Ramtha), and the other the Bagdad Theater in Portland, Oregon, where it was filmed. Within several weeks, the film had appeared in a dozen or more theaters (mostly in the western United States), and within six months it had made its way into 200 theaters across the US. According to the makers of the film, \\"Bleep\\" is an expurgation of \\"fuck\\". William Arntz has referred to the film as \\"WTFDWK\\" in a message to the film's street team. The Institute of Noetic Sciences, a New Age research organization that \\"explores phenomena that do not necessarily fit conventional scientific models\\", has supported What the Bleep Do We Know!? and published a study guide.Institute of Noetic Sciences. What the Bleep Do We Know!? Study Guide Reception According to Publishers Weekly, the film was one of the sleeper hits of 2004, as \\"word-of-mouth and strategic marketing kept it in theaters for an entire year.\\" The article states that the domestic gross exceeded $10 million, described as not bad for a low-budget documentary, and that the DVD release attained even more significant success with over a million units shipped in the first six months following its release in March 2005. Foreign gross added another $5 million for a worldwide gross of nearly $16 million.Box office results from Box Office Mojo retrieved August 3, 2010 In the Publishers Weekly article, publicist Linda Rienecker of New Page Books says that she sees the film's success as part of a wider phenomenon, stating \\"A large part of the population is seeking spiritual connections, and they have the whole world to choose from now\\". Author Barrie Dolnick adds that \\"people don't want to learn how to do one thing. They'll take a little bit of Buddhism, a little bit of veganism, a little bit of astrology... They're coming into the marketplace hungry for direction, but they don't want some person who claims to have all the answers. They want suggestions, not formulas.\\" The same article quotes Bill Pfau, Advertising Manager of Inner Traditions, as saying \\"More and more ideas from the New Age community have become accepted into the mainstream.\\" Film critics offered mixed reviews as seen on the film review website Rotten Tomatoes, where it scored a \\"Rotten\\" 34% score with an average score of 4.6/10, based on 77 reviews.What the Bleep Do We Know? Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes In his review of the film, Dave Kehr of the New York Times described the \\"transition from quantum mechanics to cognitive therapy\\" as \\"plausible\\", but stated also that \\"the subsequent leap‚Äîfrom cognitive therapy into large, hazy spiritual beliefs‚Äîisn't as effectively executed. Suddenly people who were talking about subatomic particles are alluding to alternate universes and cosmic forces, all of which can be harnessed in the interest of making Ms. Matlin's character feel better about her thighs.\\" =New Age community reaction= What the Bleep Do We Know!? has been described as \\"a kind of New Age answer to The Passion of the Christ and other films that adhere to traditional religious teachings.\\"Benedicta Cipolla \\"'Bleep' Film Challenges Traditional Religion, Attracts Following\\", beliefnet.com. Accessed 2007-12-30. It offers alternative spirituality views characteristic of New Age philosophy, including critiques of the competing claims of stewardship among traditional religions [viz., institutional Judaism, Christianity, and Islam] of universally recognized and accepted moral values. =Academic reaction= Scientists who have reviewed What the Bleep Do We Know!? have described distinct assertions made in the film as pseudoscience. Lisa Randall refers to the film as \\"the bane of scientists\\". Amongst the assertions in the film that have been challenged are that water molecules can be influenced by thought (as popularized by Masaru Emoto), that meditation can reduce violent crime rates of a city, and that quantum physics implies that \\"consciousness is the ground of all being.\\" The film was also discussed in a letter published in Physics Today that challenges how physics is taught, saying teaching fails to \\"expose the mysteries physics has encountered [and] reveal the limits of our understanding\\". In the letter, the authors write: \\"the movie illustrates the uncertainty principle with a bouncing basketball being in several places at once. There's nothing wrong with that. It's recognized as pedagogical exaggeration. But the movie gradually moves to quantum 'insights' that lead a woman to toss away her antidepressant medication, to the quantum channeling of Ramtha, the 35,000-year-old Lemurian warrior, and on to even greater nonsense.\\" It went on to say that \\"Most laypeople cannot tell where the quantum physics ends and the quantum nonsense begins, and many are susceptible to being misguided,\\" and that \\"a physics student may be unable to convincingly confront unjustified extrapolations of quantum mechanics,\\" a shortcoming which the authors attribute to the current teaching of quantum mechanics, in which \\"we tacitly deny the mysteries physics has encountered\\". Richard Dawkins stated that \\"the authors seem undecided whether their theme is quantum theory or consciousness. Both are indeed mysterious, and their genuine mystery needs none of the hype with which this film relentlessly and noisily belabours us\\", concluding that the film is \\"tosh\\". Professor Clive Greated wrote that \\"thinking on neurology and addiction are covered in some detail but, unfortunately, early references in the film to quantum physics are not followed through, leading to a confused message\\". Despite his caveats, he recommends that people see the film, stating: \\"I hope it develops into a cult movie in the UK as it has in the US. Science and engineering are important for our future, and anything that engages the public can only be a good thing.\\" Simon Singh called it pseudoscience and said the suggestion \\"that if observing water changes its molecular structure, and if we are 90% water, then by observing ourselves we can change at a fundamental level via the laws of quantum physics\\" was \\"ridiculous balderdash\\". According to Jo√£o Magueijo, professor in theoretical physics at Imperial College, the film deliberately misquotes science.\\"The minds boggle\\". The Guardian Unlimited The American Chemical Society's review criticizes the film as a \\"pseudoscientific docudrama\\", saying \\"Among the more outlandish assertions are that people can travel backward in time, and that matter is actually thought.\\" Bernie Hobbs, a science writer with ABC Science Online, explains why the film is incorrect about quantum physics and reality: \\"The observer effect of quantum physics isn't about people or reality. It comes from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, and it's about the limitations of trying to measure the position and momentum of subatomic particles... this only applies to sub-atomic particles‚Äîa rock doesn't need you to bump into it to exist. It's there. The sub-atomic particles that make up the atoms that make up the rock are there too.\\" Hobbs also discusses Hagelin's experiment with Transcendental Meditation and the Washington DC rate of violent crime, saying that \\"the number of murders actually went up\\". Hobbs further disputed the film's use of the ten percent of the brain myth.What the Bleep are they On About?! Australian Broadcasting Corporation David Albert, a philosopher of physics who appears in the film, has accused the filmmakers of selectively editing his interview to make it appear that he endorses the film's thesis that quantum mechanics is linked with consciousness. He says he is \\"profoundly unsympathetic to attempts at linking quantum mechanics with consciousness\\". These issues relate to the so-called Quantum mind-body problem. In the film, during a discussion of the influence of experience on perception, Candace Pert notes a story, which she says she believes is true, of Native Americans being unable to see Columbus's ships because they were outside their experience. According to an article in Fortean Times by David Hambling, the origins of this story likely involved the voyages of Captain James Cook, not Columbus, and an account related by Robert Hughes which said Cook's ships were \\"...complex and unfamiliar as to defy the natives' understanding\\". Hambling says it is likely that both the Hughes account and the story told by Pert were exaggerations of the records left by Captain Cook and the botanist Joseph Banks. Skeptic James Randi described the film as \\"a fantasy docudrama\\" and \\"[a] rampant example of abuse by charlatans and cults\\". Eric Scerri in a review for Committee for Skeptical Inquiry dismisses it as \\"a hodgepodge of all kinds of crackpot nonsense,\\" where \\"science [is] distorted and sensationalized\\".Review by Eric Scerri of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry A BBC reviewer described it as \\"a documentary aimed at the totally gullible\\".Review at BBC Movies According to Margaret Wertheim, \\"History abounds with religious enthusiasts who have read spiritual portent into the arrangement of the planets, the vacuum of space, electromagnetic waves and the big bang. But no scientific discovery has proved so ripe for spiritual projection as the theories of quantum physics, replete with their quixotic qualities of uncertainty, simultaneity and parallelism.\\" Wertheim continues that the film \\"abandons itself entirely to the ecstasies of quantum mysticism, finding in this aleatory description of nature the key to spiritual transformation. As one of the film's characters gushes early in the proceedings, 'The moment we acknowledge the quantum self, we say that somebody has become enlightened'. A moment in which 'the mathematical formalisms of quantum mechanics [...] are stripped of all empirical content and reduced to a set of syrupy nostrums'.\\"Margaret Wertheim, , LA Weekly, June 10, 2004. Accessed 2010-07-21. Journalist John Gorenfeld, writing in Salon, notes that the film's three directors are students of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, which he says has been described as a cult. Book adaptation and sequel film In mid-2005, the filmmakers worked with HCI Books to expand on the film's themes in a book titled What the Bleep Do We Know!?‚ÄîDiscovering the Endless Possibilities of Your Everyday Reality. HCI president Peter Vegso stated that in regard to this book, \\"What the Bleep is the quantum leap in the New Age world,\\" and \\"by marrying science and spirituality, it is the foundation of future thought.\\" On August 1, 2006 What the Bleep!

Video servers are used in a number of applications, and often have additional functions and capabilities that address the needs of particular applications. For example, video servers used in security, surveillance and inspection applications typically are designed to capture video from one or more cameras and deliver the video via a computer network. In video production and broadcast applications, a video server may have the ability to record and play recorded video, and to deliver many video streams simultaneously. Video broadcast and production A video replay server, commonly used to provide instant replay in broadcasts of sporting events (EVS XT2) Large online providers of video on-demand employ clusters of servers such as this to simultaneously output multiple streams (Emulab) In TV broadcast industries, a server is a device used to store broadcast quality images and allows several users to edit stories using the images they contain simultaneously. The video server can be used in a number of contexts, some of which include: * News: providing short news video clips as part of a news broadcast as seen on networks (like CNN and Fox News). * Production: enhance live events with instant replays and slow motion and highlights (sport production) (see OB Vans) * Instruction: delivering course material in video format. * Public Access: delivering city specific information to residents over a cable system. * Surveillance: deliver real-time video images of protected site. * Entertainment: deliver anything used for entertainment. It can be gaming, news, movie trailers, or movies. A professional-grade video server performs recording, storage, and playout of multiple video streams without any degradation of the video signal. Broadcast quality video servers often store hundreds of hours of compressed audio and video (in different codecs), play out multiple and synchronised simultaneous streams of video by, and offer quality interfaces such as SDI for digital video and XLR for balanced analog audio, AES/EBU digital audio and also Time Code. A genlock input is usually provided to provide a means of synchronizing with the house reference clock, thereby avoiding the need for timebase correction or frame synchronizers. Video servers usually offer some type of control interface allowing them to be driven by broadcast automation systems that incorporate sophisticated broadcast programming applications. Popular protocols include VDCP and the 9-Pin Protocol. They can optionally allow direct to disk recording using the same codec that is used in various post-production video editing software packages to prevent any wasted time in transcoding. = Features = Typically, a video server can do the following: * Ingest of different sources : video cameras (multiple angles), satellite data feeds, disk drives and other video servers. This can be done in different codecs. * Temporary or definitive storage of these video feeds. * Maintain a clear structure of all stored media with appropriate metadata to allow fast search : name, remarks, rating, date, time code, etc. * video editing of the different clips * Transfer those clips to other video servers or playout directly (via IP interface or SDI) Generally, they have several bi directional channels (record and ingest) for video and audio. A perfect synchronisation is necessary between those channels to manage the feeds. Video surveillance and inspection In some surveillance and inspection applications, IP video servers are employed which convert analog video signals into IP video streams. These IP video servers can stream digitized video over IP networks in the same way that an IP Camera can. Because an IP Video server uses IP protocols, it can stream video over any IP-compatible network, including via a modem for access over a phone or ISDN connection. With the use of a video server attached to an analog camera, the video from an existing surveillance system can be converted and networked into a new IP surveillance system. In the video security industry a video server is a device to which one or more video sources can be attached. Video servers are used to give existing analog systems network connectivity. Video servers are essentially transmission/ telemetry / monitoring devices. Viewing is done using a web browser or in some cases supplied software. These products also allow the upload of images to the internet or direct viewing from the internet. In order to upload to the internet an account with an ISP (internet service provider) may be required. Phone apps that send direct security video feed to smartphones from security video servers are another recent security video server application innovation. This allows smartphone users to view security video server feed from anywhere they can use their smartphone.Viewing Your Security Camera on Your Android Smartphone with MPRMS See also * Broadcast automation and playout * Centralcasting * Media server (Consumer)  References  Broadcast engineering Television terminology Video storage Video ","title":"Video server"},{"id":"984041","text":"A U2 storefront at Hong Kong's Kowloon Bay Telford Garden Mall U2 Clothing was a casual-wear clothing brand founded by Michael Tien in 1980 in Hong Kong.

The creek flows through Oak Orchard Creek Marsh, of which were declared a National Natural Landmark in May 1973. The marshlands through which Oak Orchard Creek flows are a major stopover points for migratory birds, and are protected by state- and federally-designated conservation areas. Course Aerial view of Oak Orchard Creek, 2013. The creek is slightly right of center in the photo, running roughly vertically from the bottom of the image to the lake at top. Oak Orchard Creek rises south of Oak Orchard Creek Marsh (also called the \\"Alabama Swamp\\") at the border of Orleans and Genesee counties. The swamp contains a state reserve, Oak Orchard Wildlife Management Area, and a national reserve, the Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge, both of which are known as major stopover points for migratory birds. Oak Orchard Creek Marsh was designated a National Natural Landmark in May 1973. The swamp is a result of a partial blockage of the river by glacial drift and an outcrop of limestone and dolomite known as the Lockport Formation which forms the Niagara Escarpment. Waterport Pond, also known as Lake Alice, is the widest point of Oak Orchard Creek After flowing through the swamp, it flows northward, across the escarpment in a series of waterfalls and rapids at Shelby Center, thence passing through the Village of Medina to the small Glenwood Lake north of the village. The creek departs the town of Ridgeway at its northeast corner, cuts through the northwest corner of the town of Gaines, and widens before entering the town of Carlton. The widest part is now known as Waterport Pond (Lake Alice), and the hamlet of Waterport is on the south bank. A dam at the northeast end of the pond controls water flow. Oak Orchard Creek narrows again and passes underneath Route 18 and the Lake Ontario State Parkway before entering Lake Ontario at Point Breeze where Oak Orchard State Marine Park is located. The lower part of the creek remains relatively ice-free during winters presumably due to steady flow of water and hydro-plant at Waterport. Sporting activities =Boating= Several boat launch locations exist in the lower Oak Orchard Creek. Two are near Point Breeze at the state park. Three more are near the Route 18 overpass. Boating is limited to a short distance upstream from a point called Toms Landing due to the shallow depth. Most boaters enter the creek in order to fish. There is some concern about pollutants from anti-fouling paint on boat hulls. =Fishing= The state fish hatcheries release brown trout, salmon and steelhead each year into the river. Fishing may be done from boats in the lower part, by wading in the upper parts, and from the shore along its length. =Other activities= The entire area of public lands is open for birdwatching and hiking. Within the Oak Orchard Swamp other activities, such as hunting and trapping, can be done by permit. Boating is restricted to non- powered boats, and picnicking and camping are restricted to specific areas.

He is now residing in Canada.  Early life and activities in Canada  Cheng has family roots from Chaozhou, Guangdong. He grew up in Hong Kong and received his education in Hong Kong. Starting as an aircraft maintenance apprentice, he subsequently qualified as an aircraft maintenance engineer in Canada in 1969. He became a Canadian citizen four years later. He was a delegate to the First Chinese Canadian National Conference in 1975. The same year, he served as secretary to the Immigration Policy Action Committee and co-chairman of the National Committee to Save Chinese Barbeque Products. In 1976, he became a founding member of the Vancouver Chinese Cultural Centre. Cheng coordinated a series of cultural activities in the 1970s, including the Chinatown events for the United Nations' Habitat Vancouver Festival and the Shanghai Ballet national tour in Canada under the auspices of the Canada Council led by the Secretary of State of the federal government. From 1977 to 1979, he was a board member of the Vancouver Strathcona Community Center. He is the founding president of the Chinese Canadian Association of Hong Kong, which was established in 1988. Cheng was granted the Vancouver Community Award in 1978 in recognition of his cultural integrity and contribution especially to the Canadian Chinese community. Cheng is the founder and founding president of the Chinese Canadian Association in Hong Kong.  Entrepreneurship  In 1981, Cheng left the aviation industry and became an independent market consultant. In 1983, Cheng was lured by the chairwoman of Sing Tao Holdings, Sally Aw Sian, to return to Hong Kong to spearhead the Group's advertising, marketing and business development initiatives. He left the company in 1985. After consulting for a Sino-Canadian joint venture on the tender for a Light Rail Transit system project, Cheng established Capital Communications Corporation in 1986 to publish the Chinese editions of international titles, such as the Capital, Playboy and Forbes magazines, Chinese edition. The company was merged with Paramount Publishing Group in 1991 (a public listed company) to become the largest publishing and printing house in the region. In 1991, Capital Communications Corporation was acquired by Paramount Publishing Group, with Cheng becoming CEO, a position he held until 1994. His entrepreneurship earned him the nickname \\"Taipan\\". Cheng was appointed as consultant for a wide spectrum of key institutions in Hong Kong, including the Land Development Council, Mass Transit Railway Corporation, Hong Kong Jockey Club, Trade Development Council, PCCW, Futures and Security Commission and Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Cheng was a board member of the Hong Kong Audit Bureau of Circulation (HKABC). He also served as board member, treasurer, chairman of the Society of Hong Kong Publishers from 1988 to 1990. He has been served as a trustee of the Foundation of Businesses in Support of the Arts since 1990. He was a member of the Securities & Futures Commission's Public Shareholders Group. Cheng also led the Hong Kong Expo' 97 Initiative Committee in 1988. In 1999, Cheng took advantage of the dot-com boom to set up 36.com Holdings Ltd. 36.com later ventured into publishing the weekly Cup magazine. Cheng remains publisher emeritus of the now monthly Cup magazine.  Political activism  In May 1989, over a million Hong Kongers took to the streets to rally for the pro-democracy student movement in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Democratic Patriotic Movements of China was established during the massive protests. Cheng is a co-founder of this multi- sectorial umbrella civil body to back the Chinese students' demand for democracy and a clean government. The peaceful demonstrations in Tiananmen Square ended in a bloody military crackdown, which shook Hong Kong and the world. Cheng then went on to form the Right of Abode Delegation, with Hong Kong leading businessmen to press London for full British passports for Hong Kong people as a political insurance policy. The campaign resulted in right of abode in Britain for some 50,000 Hong Kong people. As an activist, he was instrumental in mobilising mass opposition in 2002 to the Hong Kong Government's Central and Wan Chai Reclamation Project, which was regarded as environmental-unfriendly and a threat to Hong Kong's renown Victoria Harbor. He was behind a judicial review that resulted in stopping the reclamation in Central.  Media personality  In 1994, Cheng co-hosted the ground-breaking political talk show \\"News Tease\\" on Asia Television which set the trend of current affairs commentary programmes in the local electronic media. He was under pressure to leave the business sector because of his candid political remarks. Apart from ATV, he also hosted current affairs talk shows on Cable TV and Now TV. A year later, he left Paramount Publishing Group and Capital Communications to become a full-time host of Commercial Radio's breakfast talk-back show Teacup in a Storm. He spoke for the social underdogs and pressed the authorities into action on matters of public concern. In addition despite his absence from Canada, Cheng has doubled up as a commentator for Overseas Chinese Voice (AM 1320 CHMB), a multicultural radio station in Vancouver. His commentaries were syndicated across overseas Chinese-speaking communities in North America and Australia. He ended his radio show on AM1320 on 30 August 2019. In print, Cheng had been a columnist for the Ming Pao Weekly, Hong Kong Economic Journal and South China Morning Post since 1999. = 1998 assault = On 19 August 1998, Cheng was ambushed by two knife- wielding assailants and sustained serious injuries outside the radio station before he was scheduled to air. He was struck on his back, arms and right leg for a total of six times, leaving deep wounds up to 22 cm long. He was brought to intensive care where he underwent four and a half hours of surgery to reattach his broken bones, flesh and nerves. Despite the police offering a potential HK$500,000 reward, no arrests were made and the motive for the attack remains unknown. The attack shocked Hong Kong society and raised concerns about freedom of speech in the former British colony, one year after the handover to China at the time. Premier Glen Clark of British Columbia visited him in the hospital during his official visit to Hong Kong. The same year, Premier Clark introduced him to the BC assembly, where he was recognised. Cheng returned to host Teacup in a Storm later in the year. Despite his vast popularity, Cheng's contract with Commercial Radio was terminated abruptly and unilaterally in 2004 as the station buckled under political pressure in the run-up to the renewal of its broadcasting license.  Legislative career  After Commercial Radio had dismissed him under political pressure, Cheng decided to run for a place in the legislature. He gave up his Canadian citizenship in 2004 to comply with local election requirements for direct elections to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. He won a seat in the Legislative Council and tackled vital issues such as the opening up of the public airwaves, imposing tighter tobacco control, introducing food labelling, and regulating against unscrupulous practices in the sales of residential flats. Cheng was opposed to the privatisation of the government's shopping malls and car parks in its public housing estates. He was concerned that the ill-considered move would undermine the interests of the low-income public housing tenants, especially the elderly ones. He strived in vain to stop the related listing of the Link REIT on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2005. Cheng was appointed by the Chief Executive of the HKSAR for four years to serve on the Independent Police Complaints Council, which is tasked with monitoring the review by the Complaints Against Police Office of complaints against members of the Police Force. During his tenure, Cheng served as the Chairman of the Publicity Committee. He chaired the Panel on Information Technology and Broadcasting of the law-making body and promoted an \\"open sky\\" policy for the electronic media.  Digital radio proprietorship  In 2008, Cheng announced that he would not seek re-election to Legco to avoid possible conflict of interests in his efforts to apply for a license to operate a radio station. His Wave Media was awarded a license in 2009 to prepare for Hong Kong's first Digital Audio Broadcast service, under the banner of Digital Broadcasting Corporation (DBC). He ran into a major argument with other shareholders as he insisted on an independent editorial policy that is critical of government failings. He founded D100 Radio, an online multimedia operation, after leaving his role as DBC chairman.  Charity and community service  Cheng is a voting member of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, the first Asian charity donor to be listed in the world's top 10. He also sat on another major charity in Hong Kong, the Community Chest. He was a member of the Public Relations Committee and Corporate & Employee Contribution Programme Organizing Committee of the Community Chest, which is a statutory body functioning as an umbrella organisation to provide grants to a wide range of community projects. In 1996, the Senior Citizen Home Safety Association (SCHSA) was founded by Albert Cheng, Dr. C.K. Law (GBS, JP), and a group of individuals, in response to a prolonged cold spell during which more than one hundred elderly living alone were found dead. The association is a self- financing social enterprise and charitable organization in Hong Kong that offers 24-hour personal caring and emergency assistance services to the elderly and others. From 2003 to 2004, Cheng served as a member of the Securities & Futures Commission Public Shareholders Group to advise on issues relating to safeguarding shareholders' rights and interests. Cheng was chairman of the second Hong Kong Film Awards Organizing Committee in 1984. He was a member of the Hong Kong Film Development Council from 2011 to 2013 to advise the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development on relevant policies and activities, including manpower training, Mainland and overseas promotion, and support for the film industry.  Academic service  Cheng acts as Asia adviser to the Provost and responsible for establishing the Greater China Scholarship of the University of Notre Dame. He was on the board of Hong Kong Shue Yan University's academic advisory board and curriculum vetting committee. He was a governor and honorary development director of the English Schools Foundation (ESF), the biggest international educational foundation in Asia which runs 22 educational institutions mostly international schools in Hong Kong. Cheng was also a vetting committee member for the digital media courses of the Vocational Training Council, the largest vocational and professional education and training provider serving 250,000 students a year in Hong Kong. He was honorary vice-president of the Economic & Finance Society of the University of Hong Kong, and honorary advisor of the Society of Business Administration of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.  Personal life  Cheng married the Cantopop diva Paula Tsui in Canada in 1974, but that marriage ended in divorce five years later. In 1987 he married Irene Lo Kam-seung, Miss Hong Kong pageant winner of 1981, with whom he has three sons. He resettled in Vancouver in 2019.

The lateral sulcus is a deep fissure in each hemisphere that separates the frontal and parietal lobes from the temporal lobe. The insular cortex lies deep within the lateral sulcus. Anatomy The lateral sulcus divides both the frontal lobe and parietal lobe above from the temporal lobe below. It is in both hemispheres of the brain. The lateral sulcus is one of the earliest-developing sulci of the human brain. It first appears around the fourteenth gestational week. The insular cortex lies deep within the lateral sulcus. The lateral sulcus has a number of side branches. Two of the most prominent and most regularly found are the ascending (also called vertical) ramus and the horizontal ramus of the lateral fissure, which subdivide the inferior frontal gyrus. The lateral sulcus also contains the transverse temporal gyri, which are part of the primary and below the surface auditory cortex. Due to a phenomenon called the Yakovlevian torque, the lateral sulcus is often longer and less curved on the left hemisphere than on the right. It is also located near the Sylvian point. The area lying around the Sylvian fissure is often referred to as the perisylvian cortex.Courten Norbury: Understanding Developmental Language Disorders: From Theory to Practice 2008, p. 63 The human secondary somatosensory cortex (S2, SII) is a functionally-defined region of cortex in the parietal operculum on the ceiling of the lateral sulcus. Discovery The first depiction of the lateral sulcus (in its top right side) in 1600 in the Tabulae Pictae 112.10 by Girolamo Fabrici d'Acquapendente . The cerebral cortex was not depicted in a realistic manner until the 17th century with the Sylvian fissure being first accurately painted by Girolamo Fabrici d'Acquapendente in 1600 to provide plates for his Tabulae Pictae. The engraving by J. Voort Kamp published in 1641 that led to the lateral sulcus being named after Franciscus Sylvius Its first description is traditionally taken to be in 1641 by Caspar Bartholin who attributed its discovery to Franciscus Sylvius (1614‚Äì1672), professor of medicine at Leiden University his book Casp. Bartolini Institutiones Anatomicae where it is noted that \\"F.S. [F.S. probably refers to Franciscus Sylvius] If you examine the indentations which are represented in Figure 5 quite attentively, you will notice that they are very deep and that the brain is divided from one side to the other by the ‚Äúanfractuosa fissura,‚Äù which starts in the front part near the ocular roots, and from there moves backwards above the base of the spinal cord, following the temporal bones, and it divides the upper part of the brain from the lower.\\" It has been suggested that since Caspar Bartholin died in 1629 and Franciscus Sylvius only started medicine in 1632 that these words are either by his son Thomas Bartholin or Franciscus Sylvius. In 1663 in his Disputationem Medicarum, Franciscus Sylvius described the lateral fissure: \\"Particularly noticeable is the deep fissure or hiatus which begins at the roots of the eyes (oculorum radices) . . . it runs posteriorly above the temples as far as the roots of the brain stem (medulla radices). . . . It divides the cerebrum into an upper, larger part and a lower, smaller part\\". In popular culture Right: Red cloak as lateral view of the human brain Pop musician David Bowie referred to depth psychologist Carl Jung as \\"...crashing out with Sylvian\\" in his lyrics to \\"Drive In Saturday\\" released on his 1973 album Aladdin Sane. In 2015,Stark, Tanja (2015) ‚ÄúCrashing Out with Sylvian: David Bowie, Carl Jung and the Unconscious‚Äù in Eoin Devereux, Martin Power and Aileen Dillane (Eds.) David Bowie: Critical Perspectives.Routledge. artist Tanja Stark suggested Bowie had drawn a cryptic link between Jung‚Äôs waking hallucinatory visions (see The Red Book) and the Sylvian fissure, a region discovered by that time to produce hallucinogenic visions and ‚Äòparanormal‚Äô perceptions when electrically stimulated and, presciently in 2006, to generate what neurologists called an ‚Äòillusory shadow person‚Äô or doppelg√§nger phenomenon; themselves highly charged and recurring Bowie archetypes (Penfield 1955; Arzy et al., 2006). Stark notes another song on that album \\"Oh You Pretty Things\\" sings of the hallucinatory spectre of ..\\"a crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me\\", evoking the iconic imagery of Michelangelo's painting The Creation of Adam. Stark observes that the American Medical Journal reported that Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam appears to conform deliberately to the neuroanatomical shape of the brain, its Sylvian fissure clearly evident, suggesting Michelangelo may have intentionally conflated theology with neurology ( Meshberger 1990: 1837). Others though, have likened the cloak to the uterus and umbilical cord.

Orbital phasing is primarily used in scenarios where a spacecraft in a given orbit must be moved to a different location within the same orbit. The change in position within the orbit is usually defined as the phase angle, œï, and is the change in true anomaly required between the spacecraft's current position to the final position. The phase angle can be converted in terms of time using Kepler's Equation:Curtis, Howard D (2014). Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students (Third Edition). Butterworth-Heinemann. p. 312-316. . :t=\\\\frac{T_1}{2 \\\\pi} (E-e_1 \\\\sin E) :E=2 \\\\arctan (\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1-e_1}{1+e_1}} \\\\tan{\\\\frac{\\\\phi}{2}}) where :t is defined as time elapsed to cover phase angle in original orbit :T1 is defined as period of original orbit :E is defined as change of Eccentric anomaly between spacecraft and final position :e1 is defined as Orbital eccentricity of original orbit :Œ¶ is defined as change in true anomaly between spacecraft and final position This time derived from the phase angle is the required time the spacecraft must gain or lose to be located at the final position within the orbit. To gain or lose this time, the spacecraft must be subjected to a simple two-impulse Hohmann transfer which takes the spacecraft away from, and then back to, its original orbit. The first impulse to change the spacecraft's orbit is performed at a specific point in the original orbit (point of impulse, POI), usually performed in the original orbit's periapsis or apoapsis. The impulse creates a new orbit called the ‚Äúphasing orbit‚Äù and is larger or smaller than the original orbit resulting in a different period time than the original orbit. The difference in period time between the original and phasing orbits will be equal to the time converted from the phase angle. Once one period of the phasing orbit is complete, the spacecraft will return to the POI and the spacecraft will once again be subjected to a second impulse, equal and opposite to the first impulse, to return it to the original orbit. When complete, the spacecraft will be in the targeted final position within the original obit. To find some of the phasing orbital parameters, first one must find the required period time of the phasing orbit using the following equation. :T_2=T_1-t where :T1 is defined as period of original orbit :T2 is defined as period of phasing orbit :t is defined as time elapsed to cover phase angle in original orbit Once phasing orbit period is determined, the phasing orbit semimajor axis can be derived from the period formula:Francis, Hale J (1994).

A second change in velocity equal to the magnitude but opposite in direction of the first must be done after the spacecraft travels one phase orbit period to return the spacecraft from the phasing orbit to the original orbit. Total change of velocity required for the phasing maneuver is equal to two times ‚àÜV. Orbit phasing can also be referenced as co-orbital rendezvous Sellers, Jerry Jon (2005). Understanding Space An Introduction to Astronautics (Third Edition). McGraw-Hill. p. 213-214. . like a successful approach to a space station in a docking maneuver. Here, two spacecraft on the same orbit but at different true anomalies rendezvous by either one or both of the spacecrafts entering phasing orbits which cause them to return to their original orbit at the same true anomaly at the same time. Phasing maneuvers are also commonly employed by geosynchronous satellites, either to conduct station-keeping maneuvers to maintain their orbit above a specific longitude, or to change longitude altogether.
