Demand drafts are also a popular method for lending institutions to attempt to collect on overdue loans.Association for Financial Professionals. October 5, 2005. Thieves Exploit Demand Draft. Retrieved on December 07, 2013.  Fraud and regulation   Fraud  Demand drafts entail a large potential for fraud. Banks report that demand draft fraud is becoming more common. Under the current Federal Reserve Board guidelines the customer has a time frame of 90 days from the time the check was deposited to dispute the transactions. Check drafting is creating a valid legal copy of the customer's check, on the customer's behalf. Because it is created by the merchant, no signature is required. Instead, a signature disclaimer or facsimile is entered in the signature blank. A check draft is typically for deposit only. This allows fraud by knowing the individual's bank account numbers. Demand draft fraud can be frustrating for consumers, because unlike credit card or ACH disputes, consumers are not often given any funds back until after investigation finds that the draft was unauthorized. In addition, filing a dispute frequently requires a notarized signature, since this is the only way one bank can dispute a paper item with another bank.  Regulation  The Uniform Commercial Code permits the process of check drafting by defining signature in the following regulation: Uniform Commercial Code, Title 1, Section 1-201 (39). This regulation only makes check drafting possible, not \\"required.\\" Your bank may deny your items for deposit if they have reason to be suspicious. Suspicious items are covered in Regulation CC 229.13, Exceptions. Authorization is indicated on a check draft in the signature blank, usually by a statement such as the following: \\"This draft is preauthorized by your depositor, no signature required.\\". Unlike ACH transactions that are governed by NACHA regulations, check drafting allows outbound telemarketers to accept these types of phone payments if they comply with the FTC Regulations 16 CFR 310 in regard to proper record keeping. In 2005, the US Federal Reserve issued a regulation (effective July 1, 2006) shifting responsibility for payment of fraudulent demand drafts from the bank it is drawn on to the bank that accepts it as a deposit.http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/bcreg/2005/20051121/attachment.pdf Most recent developments in check drafting, which helps to facilitate checks by phone, checks by fax and online check payments is the new \\"Substitute Check Law\\" known as Check 21, enacted on October 28, 2004, which has greatly increased the use of check drafting.

Background The town of Dhuluiya (or Dhuluiyah), 50 miles south of Tikrit and 90 kilometres (55 miles) north of Baghdad, is strategically located on roads linking the eastern province of Diyala to Saladin Governorate in the north. On July 14, 2014, ISIL took control of part of the town. They bombed government buildings, including a court and local council headquarters, and exploded a bridge leading toward the neighboring town of Balad in an effort to prevent the arrival of reinforcements. The Jubur (or Jabour or Jubouri) tribe, a Sunni tribe in the south of the town, had been resisting ISIL attacks for nearly six months. In October, Iraqi forces retook most of Dhuluiya, but ISIL later launched a counter-offensive and managed to recapture the ground they had lost. Offensive On December 26, Iraqi forces attacked ISIL positions on several fronts and captured a string of villages south of Dhuluiya. On December 28, the troops entered from the north backed by the air force, and seized the airport just outside the town. On December 30, Iraqi forces completed the recapture of the town of Dhuluiya.

It stars Ganesh, V. Ravichandran and Neha Shetty in the lead roles, with Aindrita Ray appearing in a pivotal role. The supporting cast features P. Ravi Shankar and Sadhu Kokila. Although not a sequel, the film's title came as the second installment to the film Mungaru Male (2006). The film found its theatrical release worldwide on 9 September 2016, while in Karnataka, the release was pushed to 10 September 2016 because of the Cauvery water dispute.  Cast  * Ganesh as Preetham * Neha Shetty as Nandini (voice dubbed by Deepa Bhaskar) * V. Ravichandran as Preetham's Father * Shilpa Manjunath as Aishwarya/Aishu * Aindrita Ray as Preetham's Girlfriend * P. Ravi Shankar as Nandini's father * Sadhu Kokila as Nandini's uncle * Shraddha Srinath as Guest appearance Prequel The film Mungaru Male was directed by Yogaraj Bhat, which was released on December 2006, and went on to collect more than 750 million in Indian box office in its lifetime theatrical run of 865-days against a budget of 20 million, film had featured Pooja Gandhi and Ganesh.  Production   Development  After the commercial success of the 2006 film Mungaru Male, which grossed 750 million, the makers conceived a second part for the film, which they had previously planned while shooting for the film was on course. With producer E. Krishnappa objecting to the title Mungaru Male Part 2, the title Preetham Prem Kahani was fixed. Ganesh was to reprise his role as Preetham opposite Ramya. In September, The Times of India carried a report which said that Rockline Venkatesh would produce the film titled Mungaru Male 2, and that it would be directed by Preetham Gubbi, the screenwriter of Mungaru Male. It was reported that Ganesh would reprise his role and the makers were on the lookout for the female lead. The sequel however, did not take off for seven years until reports came out in early-July 2014, when it was announced, albeit by a different team. It was reported that G. Gangadhar, the executive producer of Mungaru Male would produce it. He approached Shashank to direct it, who initially refused, but was keen on directing Ganesh. However, after much insistence, reports said Shashank relented and began working on the film's story and screenplay, which he completed by March 2015. It was revealed that Ganesh would reprise his role in the film as the main protagonist, and that the film would be titled Mungaru Male 2.  Casting  V. Ravichandran was the second actor to be signed by the makers of the film, in May 2015, though at the time of the announcement, his role in the film was not made clear. However, it was speculated that he would play Ganesh's father. The director Shashank said the search for a \\"new face\\" as a female lead began with the announcement of the film. He spotted the photos of a Mangalore-based model Neha Shetty, in the newspapers in February 2015, as reports came out of her winning beauty contest WTN Miss Mangalore, who on being placed at the Miss India South emerged as a runner-up. Keen on having her on the film, he approached her, who, then a student of pre- university course was busy with her examinations. She was eventually signed in July 2015 as the female lead opposite Ganesh. It was also revealed that P. Ravi Shankar and Sadhu Kokila would play supporting roles. Arjun Janya was signed by the makers to score the film's background music and compose six track as part of its soundtrack.  Filming  Jog Falls in Sagara, Karnataka, where a few sequences of the film were shot. At the time of announcement of the film in November 2014, it was reported that the film, unlike its prequel would be filmed over two seasons, the summer and monsoon. The director Shashank said, \\"[Filming] will go on for five months during the scorching heat of summer as well as during the heavy rains.\\" To coincide with the date of commencing of filming and theatrical release of Mungaru Male, the makers planned on having them on the same dates ‚Äì 28 July and 26 December 2015 respectively. As scheduled, filming began on 26 July. Major part of the first schedule was filmed in the Malnad region of Karnataka and was completed in late-August. Around this time, it was revealed that Ravichandran would play the role of Ganesh's father in the film. The second schedule began in mid- September. Filming took place in areas surrounding Jog Falls, in the Sagara region of Karnataka. Speaking to The Times of India, Shashank said, \\"[W]e are capturing a very important sequence at the waterfalls, which will include a major fight sequence. We are also shooting some romantic scenes in the surrounding locations, which are unexplored in Sandalwood.\\" In February 2016, it was reported that most of the filming was complete except the songs. Also reportedly, Ganesh would fly to Slovenia along with Aindrita Ray to shoot for a song together. Soundtrack Arjun Janya has scored the soundtrack and score for the film. A total of six songs and one instrumental track were composed by him and written by the lyricists such as Jayanth Kaikini, Kaviraj, Chandan Shetty, Gopi Iyengar and the director Shashank. Noted singers such as Sonu Nigam and Shreya Ghoshal who got their big breaks in Kannada cinema through Mungaru Male recorded their voices to the sequel as well. Bollywood singer Armaan Malik recorded his breakthrough Kannada song and so did the Rajastani folk singer Swaroop Khan. The music for the film was one of the highly anticipated album since its prequel was a musical blockbuster which was composed by Mano Murthy. The audio was officially released on 5 August 2016 through Jhankar Music label. Release The first teaser of the film was released on 5 June 2016 on YouTube. The 107-second video introduces the characters in the film, and actors Upendra, Shiva Rajkumar, Puneeth Rajkumar, Yash and Sudeep feature in it asking questions about the film.

He grew up in poverty in Yorkshire, served in the Royal Air Force in the Second World War, and emigrated to Canada in 1953. After retiring, Smith wrote his memoirs and about the social history of 20th- century Britain. Smith wrote five books, about life in the Great Depression, the Second World War, and post-war austerity, and columns for The Guardian, New Statesman, The Daily Mirror, International Business Times, and the Morning Star. He appeared in public at the 2014 Labour Party conference in Manchester, and during the 2015 general election and the 2016 EU membership referendum. In Canada he made a 2015 \\"Stand Up for Progress\\" national tour. Early life Smith was born on 25 February 1923, in Barnsley, Yorkshire, the son of Albert Smith (1867‚Äì1943), an unemployed coal miner, and Lillian Dean (1894‚Äì1978). His eldest sister Marion died of tuberculosis in 1926, aged ten years; as there was no cure for the disease at the time, nor did the family have enough money to see a doctor. After his father became unemployed, the family moved to Bradford, Yorkshire, then to Halifax, West Yorkshire. Smith joined the RAF in 1941 and spent several years in Hamburg, Germany, as part of the Allied occupation force. Whilst serving there, he met his future wife, Friede. The couple returned to the UK after he was demobilised, and he worked at various jobs around the Yorkshire area. He and Friede emigrated to Canada in November 1953, living in Scarborough (now part of Toronto) and later in Belleville, Ontario, and had three sons: Michael (born 1953), Peter (1959‚Äì2009), and John (born 1963). Smith made a career in the Oriental rug trade, as a buyer and salesman for Eaton's, specialising and importing new designs from the Middle East, the former Soviet bloc, and Afghanistan. Writing and speaking activities His wife Friede died in 1999, and his middle son Peter died in 2009. After their deaths, Smith consoled himself by turning to writing. After his retirement he was a writer of memoirs and social history, dividing his time between Ontario and Yorkshire. Smith wrote regularly for The Guardian, commenting on politics and twentieth-century history. He attracted attention in November 2013, writing that he would not wear the remembrance poppy in future years because he felt the symbol was being used to promote support for present-day conflicts. He addressed the September 2014 Labour Party conference, speaking in support of the National Health Service (NHS) and describing how common preventable diseases \\"snuffed out life like a cold breath on a warm candle flame\\" prior to the creation of the NHS. He also spoke on BBC Radio and at the Bristol Politics Festival. Smith said that it was the global financial crisis of 2008 that inspired him to take his \\"last stand\\", writing and campaigning on income inequality, public services and what he saw as the diminishing prospects for young people. \\"I want to use my time and whatever influence I have from the book to get the young in Britain to vote the only way we can: to save our social democratic institutions. I want us to make our last stand at the ballot box\\". In July 2015, Smith endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. In October 2015, Smith appeared on the BBC Three documentary We Want Our Country Back, where he sharply criticised the far-right anti-immigration political movement Britain First. In 2016, Smith also endorsed Corbyn's re-election campaign at the Labour Party leadership election. In March 2016, he said of Corbyn: \\"He is a very honest-minded man. He has the desire to change things in Britain. Corbyn will change the world for the better. There is no one else\\". He added: \\"He'll learn he has to put some more weight behind it. I am behind him and will work with him\\". In September 2017, Smith released his fifth book Don't Let My Past Be Your Future. It was published by Little Brown. Smith was also active in support of refugees during the European migrant crisis. In November 2017, he appeared on the Sky One comedy The Russell Howard Hour, where he briefly recalled his trip to the Calais Jungle, discussed his new book and the increasing dependence on food banks in the UK. Smith and Howard also discussed the NHS, with Smith reflecting on the accessibility of medical care with a family story. Smith wrote of the political situation in 2017: > I am one of the last few remaining voices left from a generation of men and > women who built a better society for our children and grandchildren out of > the horrors of the second world war, as well as the hunger of the Great > Depression. Sadly, that world my generation helped build on a foundation of > decency and fair play is being swept away by neoliberalism and the greed of > the 1%, which has brought discord around the globe. Today, the western world > stands at its most dangerous juncture since the 1930s.Harry Leslie Smith, > vocal critic of austerity, dies aged 95 The Guardian Illness and death On 20 November 2018, Smith was admitted to Belleville General Hospital in critical condition after contracting pneumonia. His hospital stay prompted an international cyber-vigil on Twitter and an outpouring of support from well-wishers from around the world; including Leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, of whom Smith was a major supporter. He died on the morning of 28 November 2018.

Artful Learning was initiated by Leonard Bernstein and is rooted in using the arts to enhance all areas of education. History In 1990, Leonard Bernstein received the Praemium Imperiale, an international prize awarded by the Japan Arts Association for lifetime achievement in the arts. Bernstein used the $100,000 prize to establish The Bernstein Education Through the Arts (BETA) Fund, Inc.http://www.leonardbernstein.com/pfr/pfr_FALL05_rev2.pdf Leonard Bernstein provided this grant to develop an arts-based education program. The Leonard Bernstein Centerhttp://www.leonardbernstein.com/lbcenter.htm was established in April 1992, and initiated extensive school-based research, resulting in the Bernstein Model. After six years of association with the Grammy Foundation, the Leonard Bernstein Center for Learning moved to Gettysburg College, PA. Model Artful Learning is based on Bernstein's philosophy that the arts can strengthen learning and be incorporated in all academic subjects. The program is based on \\"units of study,\\" which each consist of four core elements: experience, inquire, create, and reflect. Research Research shows that participation in the arts plays a vital role in influencing brain development and performance. Arts which are considered enrichment in education programs, may in fact be central to the way humans neurologically process and learn.http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED507091.pdfhttp://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/65g5z7wphttp://www.irma- international.org/chapter/artful-learning/106314/ In 1999, The President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities teamed up with the Arts Education Partnership to publish a comprehensive study on the inclusion of the arts in education.

The school was established by British officer and reformer Walter Bromley on 13 January 1814.Thomas Akins. History of Halifax. p. 158 He promoted the objectives of the British and Foreign School Society in Nova Scotia, under the sponsorship of Prince Edward. Walter Bromley - Canadian Biography The first patron was Sir John Coape Sherbrooke. Prior to the existence of public schools, the school offered schooling for middle-income students as well as low-income women, black students and immigrants. The school also welcomed Protestants and Catholics. The school was controversial, however, some of its biggest supporters were Thomas McCulloch, Samuel George William Archibald, John Young, Bishop of Nova Scotia Robert Stanser, Chief Justice Brenton Halliburton and John Starr. Walter Bromley - Canadian Biography Hugh Bell was a vice president of the School when Henry Hezekiah Cogswell was the president.  History  Bromley housed the Royal Acadian School in a converted building on Argyle St., Halifax that was formerly used by an amateur theatre troop.Akins, p. 158 In 1816, there were 400 students enrolled in the school. Bromley had recruited many black students - children and adults - whom he taught on the weekends because they were employed during the week. Thomas Akins. History of Halifax. p. 174 Some of the black students entered into business in Halifax while others were hired as servants.Akins, p. 159 In 1823, Bromley employed 67 girls and women to spin and knit native wool in his school or in their dwellings. The school ventured into this field of private enterprise to empower poor women without regard for personal profit. He paid his workers 2s. a day, which was considered a ‚Äúreasonable rate‚Äù for piece-work. Bromley also devoted himself to the service of the Mi‚Äôkmaq people.Thomas Akins. History of Halifax. p. 159 The Mi'kmaq were among the poor of Halifax and in the rural communities. According to historian Judith Finguard, his contribution to give public exposure to the plight of the Mi‚Äôkmaq ‚Äúparticularly contributes to his historical significance.‚Äù Finguard writes: :Bromley‚Äôs attitudes towards the Indians were singularly enlightened for his day‚Ä¶. Bromley totally dismissed the idea that native people were naturally inferior and set out to encourage their material improvement through settlement and agriculture, their talents through education, and their pride through his own study of their languages. Walter Bromley - Canadian Biography Bromley‚Äôs school made a ‚Äúseminal contribution‚Äù to the development of the education movement in Nova Scotia.

Flora and fauna Due to its shallowness, light penetrates to the loch floor. Consequently, many species of aquatic plants exist including water lobelia, quillwort and shoreweed. Around the perimeter reeds, sedges, horsetails, bulrushes and willow scrub are found. The loch is also home to pike, otters, migrating geese and other wildfowl. Archaeology The remains of a medieval moated homestead, known as The Heugh are visible on the northern shore of the loch. The Heugh is thought to have been the Hall of Logy Rothwayne, the headquarters of Andrew de Moray during the Battle of Culblean in 1335. Survey The loch was surveyed on 10 July 1905 by T.N.

Retrieved on August 26, 2018. \\"7300 Van Dusen Road, Laurel, Maryland 20707, United States\\" The facility now operates as a free standing Emergency Department and outpatient clinical and surgical center. History Laurel Regional Hospital was proposed in 1972. Construction funds were approved by Prince George's County Executive Winfield M. Kelly, Jr. in 1975 for a $14.5 million hospital. The building was constructed in 1978 as the \\"Greater Laurel- Beltsville Hospital\\" for $20 million. In 1983, the Prince George's council created the Community Hospital and Health Care corporation to manage the county's three hospitals. In July 1985, the Hospital Corporation of America was hired to manage the hospital system. Winfield M. Kelly, Jr. was appointed chairman of the Board and 22 members volunteered to resign. In 1993, Kelly became president of Dimensions Healthcare which took over management of Prince George's hospitals; he left Dimensions in mid-2003. In July 2011, the Gladys Spellman Specialty Care Unit relocated to Laurel Regional Hospital from Cheverly, Maryland, where it had been for 43 years. The fourth-floor unit is named for former politician Gladys Noon Spellman. The hospital is home since 1995 to a specialty outpatient Wound Care and Hyperbaric Medicine center. The center houses two monoplace hyperbaric chambers which are used for special kinds of advanced wound healing. The center received Center of Distinction Status for 2015 by its Healogics network after 12 consecutive months of \\"patient satisfaction higher than 92 percent, and a minimum wound healing rate of at least 91 percent within 30 median days to heal.\\" On July 31, 2015, Dimensions Healthcare announced its decision to close the hospital and retain only outpatient services until a new ambulatory surgery center is built in 2018. On July 18, 2016, a plan was announced by Laurel officials that would result in the hospital's being operated by the University of Maryland Medical System. On September 1, 2017, UMMS announced its ownership of Dimensions Healthcare, renamed \\"University of Maryland Capital Region Health\\". With this change, the Laurel hospital's name became University of Maryland Laurel Regional Hospital. In September 2018, Laurel Regional received approval from the Maryland Health Care Commission to begin building a medical center on the campus, after filing a request in April. Inpatient medical and surgical units and behavioral health services are to move to UM Prince George's Hospital Center by November, while some other programs will remain at the hospital during transition, including the wound care center and emergency services. Construction is to begin in early 2019 with completion by spring of 2021.

Located at 406 State Street (U.S. Route 1A), it is an outcrop of Ellsworth schist marked with striations created by glacial action between 25,000 and 13,000 years ago. This outcrop was analyzed by Harvard University geologist Louis Agassiz in 1864 and described in his groundbreaking 1867 paper, Glacial Phenomena in Maine. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history The outcrop consists of an extended patch of bedrock on the southwest side of State Street, of which two sections are presently visible on the surface. They are located at the southeast and northeast corners of the property at 406 Main Street, whose gravel driveway runs over the bedrock between the two visible sections. The southeastern section is about square, with a smooth surface on which several parallel grooves are scratched. The northeastern section is about , with a series of deep grooves. It is in particular possible to trace grooves made by stones dragged by the glacier by extending the trajectory of the grooves from one section across the parking area to the other. The buildings and other improvements on the property are not historically significant. The mid-19th century was a period of significant debate within the geological community about the nature of markings found in northern New England similar to those found here. A common belief was that they were caused by drifting icebergs during the Flood of Noah, as recounted in the Bible. The first hypothesis involving a massive glacier was proposed in 1859 by John DeLaski, an amateur geologist from Rockland, Maine, which did not receive significant scientific press until 1864. That summer, Louis Agassiz, then a professor at Harvard, vacationed in Maine, and examined a variety of bedrock locations from the coast as far inland as Mount Katahdin. His 1867 paper, Glacial Phenomena in Maine, described his findings from this trip, and proposed that North America, like much of northern Europe, had been covered by ice sheets. He specifically mentioned the \\"splendid polished surfaces\\" found at Ellsworth Falls, \\"with scratches and furrows pointing due north\\" as one piece of evidence in support of his argument.

Trams operated in Valladolid from 1881 until 1933. Trams were not only used for passengers in Valladolid, but also for urban freight transport.  Animal traction (1881‚Äì1910)  The company Sociedad General de Tranv√≠as Interiores de Valladolid was created in 1879, headed by Valerio Morales, who presents a proposal for developing the system. Valladolid City Council invited tenders for building and operating the metric gauge tram network, using animal traction. The mentioned society won the contract in June 1880. Immediately, Eduardo Barral, a Catalan entrepreneur, bought the company. The first line was opened on 22 December 1881. It was a 2.100 metres route starting at railway station. It continued by Acera de Recoletos, Santiago Street, Plaza Mayor, Lencer√≠a Street, Plater√≠as Street, Cantarranas Street (current Mac√≠as Picavea) and Corredera Street (current Angustias), crossing Plaza de San Pablo in order to reach the old bullring. Trams depot was located in Plaza de San Pablo, just in the plot now occupied by Zorrilla High School. The service was provided by four coaches and later enlarged with two more. Each coach was moved by two mules. Six years later rails reached the railway station platforms, making the transfer between train and tram easier. In 1899, a Belgian company bought the society. Although they wanted to introduce the electrical traction, it was not possible until the company was sold again. However, during this period few extensions were built. The primitive line was expanded to Plaza de San Bartolom√©, crossing the river Pisuerga. In addition, a branch was added to serve the Audience and the Cemetery and a new line was opened linking Plaza Mayor and the new bullring built on Paseo Zorrilla. A local business man and politician, Santiago Alba, promoted a change in the company with other partners and bought it in August 1909. The main objective of new owners was electrify the network.  Electric traction (1910‚Äì1933)  In February 1910 the company received the licence to change the traction of the system, and the works to do so started on 26 May 1910. The first line with electric traction opened on 7 September 1910 and it put together the southern part of the scheme (lines between Plaza Mayor, bullring and railway station). In October 1910 two more lines were powered by electricity, Plaza Mayor ‚Äì Plaza de San Bartolom√© / Audience. On 18 April 1911 the line to Cemetery was also electrified. The new depot was located next to Campo Grande park. Apart from works related to the change on traction system, two more routes were opened in 1911, a southern expansion to La Rubia from bullring place and a northern branch from Plaza de San Bartolom√© to the ending point of Canal de Castilla. The network reached 12,279 kilometers. Tram system was not enough efficient as the city expansion registered the two first decades of 20th century. In 1928 the City Council decided to complement this transit system with an urban bus network. This represented a strong rival because of its higher speed and reliability. It led a fast decreasing on passenger statistics after 1930, making the tramway company financially unsustainable. Trams stopped to run on 6 November 1933, and the bid expired in 1940.

Princess Varvara Ilynichna Turkestanova (, 26 December 1775 ‚Äì 20 May 1819) was a Russian noblewoman of Georgian origin, known for her affair with Tsar Alexander I of Russia and her correspondence with the French √©migr√© Ferdinand Christin, which describes the Russian court life of the 1810s. She committed suicide shortly after giving birth to a daughter, fathered by either Tsar Alexander or her other lover, Prince Vladimir Golitsyn. Her surname is also transliterated in Western European languages as Tourkestanoff, Tourkestanov, or Tourkestanow.  Life  Varvara Turkestanova, a third-generation √©migr√© of Georgian noble descent, was part of the Turkestanishvili family, established in Russia in 1724. She was born in Moscow. Orphaned early in life, she was reared by her relative, General Vasily Arsenyev. Due to her charm and ingenuity, she gained popularity in the Muscovite high society. She later became a lady-in-waiting of the empress Maria Feodorovna, consort of Paul I and mother of Alexander I. She became close to the tsar Alexander I in the mid-1810s, during the temporary absence of his long-time favorite, Princess Maria Naryshkina, abroad. By 1818, Varvara had also been in relationship with Prince Vladimir Golitsyn, a son of Varvara Golitsyna and a man 18 years her junior. In 1819, Varvara gave birth to a daughter, Maria, rumored to have been born of Tsar Alexander or Prince Golitsyn. As Princess Turkestanova was unmarried, the news made a scandal at the court. In despair, Varava ingested a fatal poison and died in St. Petersburg, tended by the empress Maria Feodorovna. The death was officially pronounced as related to cholera. She was buried at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. Her daughter, Maria (also known as Mimi; 1819‚Äì1843), was reared by Prince Golitsyn and eventually married Ivan Nelidov, brother of Varvara Nelidova, mistress of Nicholas I of Russia. Varvara Turkestanova's French- language correspondence with her friend, the Swiss‚ÄìFrench √©migr√© and diplomat in Russian service, Ferdinand Christin, from 1813 to 1816 details the Russian court life of the early 19th century and was published in Russkiy arkhiv (–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤) in 1882.

It was established around 1020 with close connections to Roskilde Cathedral. The school has since 1969 been located on Holb√¶kvej in the western part of the city while its old main building next to the cathedral now houses Roskilde Gymnasium, another high school. History Old drawing of Roskilde Domskole The school was probably established in the early 11th century (c. 1020) in connection with the cathedral. It was initially designed for the education of priests who could serve the cathedral. There are references to pupils at the school from 1074. Around 1080, a building was constructed to the north of the first travertine cathedral known as Kloster for Br√∏drene (Friars' Cloister) which was no doubt used as a school house. When the brick cathedral was built in the 13th century, a new school building was constructed immediately west of the cathedral. After the Reformation in 1536, the school was struck by a period of poverty, forcing the pupils to beg in the neighbourhood for food and clothing. The curriculum did not change until the 18th century when it was adapted to include both theology and law, attracting more pupils. The building from 1842, now home to Roskilde Gymnasium A new building for the school was completed on the cathedral square in 1842 to a design by J√∏rgen Hansen Koch. With its six classrooms, it was able to accommodate all 70 pupils. Girls were first admitted to the school in 1903 but were initially kept away from the boys. Despite several extensions, by 1969 the building had again become too small. The school moved to its current premises on Holb√¶kvej designed by Preben Hansen.

At the beginnings, the location selected for the abbey was in a swampy area close to San Salvo, but the harsh living conditions pushed the monks to move inside the town.

Early life Born in Chicago, Illinois, Davis was the son of a Department of State Foreign Service officer, and moved around the world with his parents during most of his early childhood. Living in various foreign countries, including African nations, Davis grew accustomed to the casually integrated schools of foreign diplomats, where children of many nations, races and cultures were schooled together. At the age of 10, he returned to the United States and joined an all-white Cub Scout pack in Belmont, Massachusetts. In one incident, he was carrying the flag and marching with his troop in a local parade, when he was struck with rocks and bottles thrown from the crowd; leading the pack leaders to form a protective ring around him. Davis at the time did not understand the incident until he discussed it with his father. The irrationality of the incident, in his mind, led to a curiosity about the origins and basis for such racist attitudes, which would later shape much of his future activity.Davis, Daryl, speaking in PBS TV Independent Lens documentary film Accidental Courtesy: Daryl Davis, Race & America, aired on PBS television network February 13, 2017, and subsequently; viewed February 18, 2017Fleishman, Jeffrey, \\"A black man's quixotic quest to quell the racism of the KKK, one robe at a time,\\" December 8, 2016, Los Angeles Times.

Davis \\"was mentored by legendary pianists Pinetop Perkins and Johnnie Johnson who both claimed him as their godson and praised his ability to master a piano style that was popular long before he was born,\\" according to his Kennedy Center profile.

For several years, Davis served as Artistic Director of the Centrum (arts organization) Acoustic Blues Festival. \\"Davis‚Äô piano work impresses with his winning combination of technique and abandon, and his vocals are strong and assured,\\" wrote a reviewer in Living Blues Magazine. \\"Black rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll lives!\\" Discography * American Roots (2000) * Alternate Routes (2005) * Greatest Hits (2011) Writer and lecturer KKK robes at Blues and Rock for Humanity in November 2017 Davis has worked to improve race relations by seeking out, engaging in dialogue with, and befriending members of the Ku Klux Klan. In 1983, he was playing country western music in a \\"white\\" bar in Frederick, Maryland when a patron came up to him and said it was the first time he had \\"heard a black man play as well as Jerry Lee Lewis\\". Davis explained to the man that \\"Jerry Lee learned to play from black blues and boogie woogie piano players and he's a friend of mine.\\" The white patron was skeptical and over a drink admitted he was a member of the KKK. The two became friends and eventually, the man gave Davis contact information on KKK leaders.Friedersdorf, Conor, \\"The Audacity of Talking About Race With the Ku Klux Klan,\\" March 27, 2015, The Atlantic. Retrieved February 18, 2017 A few years later, Davis decided that he wanted to interview Klan members and write a book on the subject, to answer a \\"question in my head from the age of 10: 'Why do you hate me when you know nothing about me?' That question had never been answered from my youth.\\" In meeting with the Imperial Wizard of the KKK in Maryland, Roger Kelly, he concealed his race before the interview. ::My secretary called him, and I told her, 'do not tell Roger Kelly I'm black. Just tell him I am writing a book on the Klan.' I wanted her to call because she's white. I knew enough about the mentality of the Klan that they would never think a white woman would work for a black man. She called him and he didn't ask what color I was, so we arranged to meet at a motel. The meeting was tense. Kelly arrived at the motel with a bodyguard armed with a gun. Davis became friends with Kelly, with Davis later invited by Kelly to be his daughter's godfather. When Kelly left the Klan, he gave his robe to Davis, who hopes to one day display it in a \\"Museum of the Klan\\". Davis eventually went on to befriend over 20 members of the KKK, and claims to have been directly responsible for between 40 and 60, and indirectly over 200 people leaving the Klan.Howard, Russell, \\"The Russell Howard Hour\\" Series 1, Episode 7 November 2, 2017, Sky UK. He found that the Klansmen had many misconceptions about blacks, which stem mostly from intense brainwashing in their youth. When they got to know him, Davis claims, it was more difficult to maintain their prejudices. Davis recounted his experiences in his 1998 book, Klan-destine Relationships: A Black Man's Odyssey in the Ku Klux Klan. One Klansman told Davis that \\"All black people have a gene in them that makes them violent,\\" based on the scientific finding that a 2-repeat MAOA gene increases the likelihood of violent activity, which was found to be most prevalent in African-Americans. ::After a time I said, 'You know, it's a fact that all white people have within them a gene that makes them serial killers. Name me three black serial killers.' He could not do it. I said 'you have the gene. It's just latent.' He said, 'Well that's stupid.' I said, 'It's just as stupid as what you said to me.' He was very quiet after that and I know it was sinking in. Klan members have often invited Davis to meetings and they have given him their robes and hoods. In 2016, Davis estimated having collected 25 or 26 robes.Accidental Courtesy: Daryl Davis, Race & America, 2016. Among the \\"Knights of the Ku Klux Klan\\" he interviewed were Grand Klaliff Chester Doles, Grand Giant Tony LaRicci, and Grand Giant Bob White, according to The Washington Post. One Klan member gave Davis a medallion stamped with the words \\"KKK ‚Äì Member in good standing.\\" Davis claims to be responsible for helping to dismantle the KKK in Maryland because things \\"fell apart\\" after he began making inroads with its members there. However, since then the KKK was rebuilt in Maryland under Richard Preston, leader of the Confederate White Knights who was arrested for firing his gun at counter-protesters at the 2017 Unite the Right rally. Daryl Davis offered to post Preston's bail. He later took Preston to the National Museum of African American History. Shortly thereafter he was asked to give away the bride at Preston's wedding. \\"The lesson learned is: ignorance breeds fear,\\" says Davis. \\"If you don't keep that fear in check, that fear will breed hatred. If you don't keep hatred in check, it will breed destruction.\\" Chester Doles, a member of the Klan, was convinced that Davis was a spy for the Anti-Defamation League or some other Klan-buster, and Davis's friends found his fascination with the Klan to be odd. \\"He's attracted to controversy,\\" says Adolph Wright, an old friend and fellow musician who believes Davis is a bit eccentric. \\"When the crowd goes right, he goes left,\\" Wright told the Post. Davis's father, the retired senior Foreign Service officer William B. Davis, believed that his son engaged with the Klan because he needed to make sense of their hatred, to seek common ground. He remarked to The Washington Post that his son \\"has done something that I don't know any other black American, or white American, has done.\\" Accidental Courtesy documentary In 2016, the documentary film, Accidental Courtesy: Daryl Davis, Race & America Davis interacts with KKK members and white Aryans, and provided contrasting views of his activities from members of the Southern Poverty Law Center and Black Lives Matter. Acting Davis has acted on stage, film and television. He played a minor character in HBO's television series The Wire. He appeared on stage in William Saroyan's The Time of Your Life with Marcia Gay Harden, Brigid Cleary, and Richard Bauer, and in Elvis Mania at an off-Broadway theater in New York City.

Picture of the Ganjali Khan Complex, one of the many buildings that were made under Ganj Ali Khan. Ganj Ali Khan () was a military officer in Safavid Iran of Kurdish origin, who served as governor in various provinces and was known for his loyal service to king (shah) Abbas I. Ganj Ali Khan continuously aided the shah on almost all of his military campaigns until his own death in 1624/5. He was also a great builder, the Ganjali Khan Complex being one of his finest achievements.  Biography  Ganj Ali Khan originally belonged to a Kurdish tribe roaming in western Iran, but was as a minor taken to Herat in Khorasan, where he grew up with prince Abbas I. They both became close friends, and continued to do so when Abbas I ascended the Safavid throne in 1587. In 1596, Abbas I, after having suppressed a rebellion in Kerman and put an end to Qizilbash governorship of the place, appointed Ganj Ali Khan as its governor. Furthermore, he was also appointed governor of Sistan, and shortly afterwards seized Qal'e-ye Fath and Qal'e-ye Taraqun from the Uzbeks. In 1602/3, he took part in the Safavid campaign to capture the Uzbek-controlled city of Bukhara. Furthermore, he also took part in the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War of 1603‚Äì18. In the mid 1600s, the Zoroastrian community of Kerman protested against the hostile treatment by the local Islamic clergy, and also accused Ganj Ali Khan of seizing and destroying their homes to make space for his construction projects. This made Abbas travel to Kerman to investigate the matter in 1606, where he found that Ganj Ali Khan was not the real perpetrator. Abbas then returned to his capital, Isfahan, where he issued an edict that ordered protection for the Zoroastrians. In 1611, a rebellion in Balochistan occurred, which Ganj Ali Khan suppressed by capturing their stronghold. Five years later, Ganj Ali Khan was once again present in the Ottoman-Safavid War, and participated in the successful invasion of Georgia. In 1622, Ganj Ali Khan was appointed as the governor of the newly captured city of Qandahar. He later died in 1624/5, while the governorship of Qandahar went to his son Ali Mardan Khan and the governorship of Kerman to a certain Tahmasp Qoli Khan.  Building activities  Ganj Ali Khan is mostly remembered for his building activities, such as the Zayn al-Din caravansary in Yazd, and the cistern in the Loot desert between Khorasan and Kerman. His most prominent construction, is, however, the Ganjali Khan Complex in Kerman.

The Guild of Entrepreneurs successfully petitioned the Court of Aldermen for Guild status in 2014 with ambitions to become a Company without Livery by 2020, and a full Livery Company by 2024. It is a membership and charitable organisation formed of men and women connected with the City of London who have invested their own time and financial resources in establishing and running successful businesses and enterprises. Its motto is Dare, Create, Succeed The Guild of Entrepreneurs Trust is a charity that was registered in England & Wales in 2016. It is a grant-making body, which principally supports business education.  Introduction  Whilst the Company of Merchant Adventurers and Society of Merchant Venturers continued the distinct craft of entrepreneurship (merchant venturing) in York and Bristol respectively, there was, in the early 21st Century, no comparable extant organisation in London. About this time, the City was recapturing some of its ancient trading origins alongside its established global role in financial and professional services. The repurposing of once large banking halls, the growth of the business centre market and the development of technology were again making the City and the surrounding area more accessible to new types of entrepreneurial activity including media, textiles, communications, retail and leisure. This entrepreneurial activity was extending into neighbourhoods such as Smithfield, Shoreditch, Spitalfields and Borough on the City fringes where small business growth was already being supported by initiatives from the City of London Corporation and its formal partners along with the Angel and Venture Capital market. The City was alive with business networks, investment clubs, technology meetings and associations, suggesting that there were many thousands of entrepreneurs with an affinity with the City of London.  Entrepreneurs ‚Äì City of London Network  The serial finance and communications entrepreneur Dan Doherty (a liveryman of the Needlemakers‚Äô Company), had already founded and was running a successful informal group for Entrepreneurs called ‚ÄúEntrepreneurs ‚Äì City of London Network‚Äù. The network met regularly at the London Capital Club in the City, and had always linked its activities to promoting enterprise in and around the City, appreciated the City‚Äôs civic activities, supported charity and pro-bono work and hosted events in City venues. The membership of this group included a number of liverymen of the City‚Äôs Livery Companies, and from amongst them and others, the Founding Committee of the proposed Guild was drawn.  Formation and Early History  With assistance from the Chamberlain‚Äôs Court and from Adele Thorpe (a Past Master of the Worshipful Company of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators and Clerk of many years‚Äô standing), a proposal document was drawn up and delivered to the Court of Aldermen. It was accompanied by numerous letters of support from amongst the City Livery Companies, academic institutions and businesses. Approval was given for the formation of the new Guild on 8 July 2014. Formal working party meetings were held in August and September 2014 to approve the rules and suggested governance of the Guild, and, on 8 September 2014, the Guild‚Äôs first Court Meeting was held at the Old Bailey, with the following Founding Freemen elected to serve as Court Assistants: * Dan Doherty * Judith Donovan CBE * Neil Fullbrook * Rupa Ganatra * Alderman Peter Hewitt * Alderman Sir Paul Judge * Rick Lowe * Neil Partridge * Lee Robertson * Fiona Taylor * Ian Taylor Sir Paul Judge, who was at that time serving his shrieval year, had been the Guild‚Äôs sponsoring Alderman, and Dan Doherty proposed that Sir Paul be installed as the Guild‚Äôs Foundation Master. The Court approved this, and the following officers were elected to serve for the first year: * Master: Alderman Sir Paul Judge * Senior Warden: Dan Doherty * Middle Warden: Judith Donovan CBE * Junior Warden: Alderman Peter Hewitt In addition to those elected to serve as Court Assistants, the Guild also recognised the support of five other Founding Freemen: * Lord Bilimoria, CBE DL * Ben Camara * Dieter R Klostermann * Cyrus Todiwala, OBE DL * Pervin Todiwala On 24 November 2014 the Guild had its official launch at Ironmongers‚Äô Hall (Worshipful Company of Ironmongers). The event was attended by the then Lord Mayor, the Sheriffs, Masters and Clerks representing over half of the City‚Äôs (then) 110 Livery Companies, as well as numerous guests. This historic ceremonial occasion lived long in the memories of those who were there ‚Äì not least due to the rousing cheers of ‚ÄúWelcome Entrepreneurs!‚Äù that rang out that evening. It was on this occasion that the Foundation Master was installed, and the Wardens and Court sworn-in, and it is on or around 24 November each year that each new Master is Installed.  Objectives  The objectives of the Guild are to: * promote excellence in the profession of Entrepreneurship; * support the Lord Mayor, encourage the growth of the City and promote its full potential to entrepreneurs and growth businesses; * foster fellowship among entrepreneurs; * give money and time for charitable works that support the development of entrepreneurs and help to bring the opportunities of entrepreneurship to young people. An entrepreneur will have identified new market opportunities, sourced and organised the required people and resources, and experienced both the risks and rewards associated with such ventures.  Activities  The Guild has a busy programme of social, educational and charitable events, which fulfil the Guild's founding objectives. In particular, the Guild has a wide range of Outreach & Educational projects in which Freeman (members of the Guild, whether men or women) undertake mentoring for students of business and entrepreneurship as well as fledgling businesses and entrepreneurial activities. The Guild of Entrepreneurs Trust is a charitable foundation set up by the Guild, but operating independently. Its primary objective is to raise and distribute money to support education and charity relating to entrepreneurship.  Motto  The Guild's motto is Dare, Create, Succeed. The motto encapsulates the criteria that an individual must fulfil before they may be considered for the Freedom of the Guild: to be audacious and daring in identifying new opportunities; to have personally financed, created and run businesses or enterprises to harness those opportunities; and for those businesses or enterprises to have been successful.  Organisation  The Guild is governed by the Court, which is made up of the Master, three Wardens, the Foundation Master, the most recent five Past Masters and between six and twenty Court Assistants elected from the Freemen. The Master and Wardens are elected annually at the Election Court in July, and take office at the Installation Court in November. The Clerk is the Chief Executive of the Guild. The first Clerk was Adele Thorpe. Duncan Simms has been Clerk since February 2015. The Officers are presently: Master: Richard Paul Lowe Senior Warden: Lars Bendik Andersen Middle Warden: Judy Hadden Junior Warden: Gary Dixon Immediate Past Master: Hon. Gp Capt. Peter LR Hewitt JP  Founder & Master, Dan Doherty  Having played so pivotal a role in the foundation, organisation and birth of the Guild, Dan Doherty was elected to serve as the Guild's second Master at the Election Court in July 2015. In October 2015, just weeks before his installation as Master, Dan was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Ably supported by his many friends and colleagues, he was installed as Master at Painters' Hall on 25 November 2015. He requested and was granted an immediate leave of absence to begin treatment for his illness, but his condition overwhelmed him and he died in office on 16 March 2016. In memory of his work as the founder of the Guild, and his Mastership, the Guild's Court purchased by private subscription the Dan Doherty Memorial Bell. The bell rings in E for Entrepreneurs and was founded at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in London's East End. The bell is rung once each year at the Installation Dinner and a toast drunk.

Jennings studied Classical figurative sculpture at Stafford Art College and was inspired by the works of Bernini and Michelangelo. Between 1999 and 2003 he specialized in portrait sculpture for Madame Tussauds and was responsible for waxwork models of Ken Livingstone, Charles Kennedy, Robin Williams and Nicolas Cage in 2008. Douglas trained as a classical sculptor and is a life member of the Royal British Society of Sculptors. He specialises in producing monumental art works for public figures in the world of sport, entertainment and politics. His artwork is in private and public collections worldwide. Douglas Jennings is known for producing public sculpture that captivates with its level of detail, naturalistic style and the beauty of his work. Jennings completed a bronze memorial of Johnny Haynes in 2008. Installed at Fulham FC, Haynes is widely regarded as the greatest footballer ever to play for the London club. He also made 56 appearances for England, including 22 as captain. In 2017 Douglas completed another commission for Fulham FC ‚Äì a commemorative bronze statue of George Cohen MBE. The piece was unveiled at Fulham FC to celebrate Cohen's remarkable career and the 50th anniversary of England's famous World Cup victory in 1966. In 2015, the quality of Douglas's work was commended by the Public Monuments and Sculpture Association. He was presented with the 'Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture' for his WWII memorial statue of Squadron Leader Mahinder Singh Pujji. This was commissioned by Gravesham Borough Council and is located in public parkland by the River Thames. In 2016 Douglas Jennings was commissioned to create a bronze memorial statue of Baroness Margaret Thatcher dressed in full ceremonial robes of the House of Lords. The piece was planned to be erected in Parliament Square, but controversially, Westminster council turned down the plan because of what officials describe as \\"monument saturation\\". Jennings is currently working on a new statue of The Queen will be erected in 2018 to mark Her Majesty's 90th birthday celebrations. The artwork was commissioned by Gravesham Council and is believed to be the only statue showing The Queen seated. The bronze statue, mounted on a stone plinth, features the monarch dressed in her Order of the Garter robes.

Most of these seem to have been original offerings, not seen elsewhere and not secondary tooling. The toy company Cragstan marketed Gamda Sabras as \\"Detroit Sr.\\" for the American Market. Company name Gamda was a toy brand name of the parent firm Habonim in Kibbutz Kfar HaNassi (Village of the President) located in Northern Israel, north of the Sea of Galilee and just adjacent to the border to the Golan Heights (Bickford 2013). The name 'Gamda' means 'midget' or 'dwarf' in Hebrew (thus 'Midget' toys)(Zohar 2005). In the 1967 Six Day War with Syria the factory was damaged and repairs were needed ‚Äì production soon resumed (Model Marque 2010). Koor was a company name added later (see next section). The latter name 'Sabra' was applied to the mid-1960s diecast line of mostly American cars and was a uniquely nationalistic Israeli concept. This word for cactus signifies an Israeli Jew born anywhere in the historical land of Palestine. It is interesting that the name Sabra was also given to the Israeli real car brand from the mid-1960s. Thus the toy brand Gamda Sabra could be translated as \\"Israeli-born midget toys\\". History In 1962, the company started recasting old British D.C.M.T. (Lone Star Toys) dies of tractors, trucks and military vehicles (Bickford 2013; Johnson 1998, p. 81; Rixon 2005, p. 36). Gamda vehicles were produced in two series ‚Äì transport (Jeepsters, Daimler, an American Buick, Ford Prefect, a Standard Vanguard delivery truck, buses, milk trucks, petrol tankers, etc.) or military (Jeeps, tanks, trucks, and trailers, etc.). One of the more popularly seen was a wheeled tank / armored car. One early Gamda offering that has become in demand is a bus in the livery of the Egged Ta'avura Cooperative, which was the main transportation agency in Israel. The bus has been known to sell for more than $1,000 (Zohar 2005). In about 1966, Gamda partnered with another firm, Koor, which was owned by the Histradrut, the Israeli trade union (Schellekens 2003). This formed a company called Gamda Koor Export (Bickford 2013). The new company mainly existed to introduce a new line of mainly American automobiles aimed at foreign markets. At the time, export taxes had been lowered, helping Israeli businesses to break into international markets (Model Marque 2010). These were called Sabra Super Cars and were mainly unique tooling of vehicles not made by other European model makers. Most Sabras were manufactured between 1969 and 1972, but some perhaps a tad earlier (Richardson 1999, p. 161). There were 24 models in the series and they were numbered from 8100 to 8123 (Schellekens 2003). Models included a 1965 Plymouth Barracuda, a 1966 Charger, a 1965 Chrysler Imperial convertible (Corgi Toys also offered a convertible Imperial, see comparison below), a 1966 Buick Riviera, a 1965 Corvette Coupe (not split window, but the convertible hardtop), a 1965 Chevrolet Chevelle station wagon, a 1966 Olds Toronado, a 1967 Cadillac Eldorado, a 1967 Cadillac Coupe deVille, a 1967 Pontiac GTO, a 1968 Pontiac Firebird, a 1967 Chevy pickup and tow truck, a 1965 Ford Mustang, a Ford GT, a 1967 Ford Torino, a 1966 Chevrolet Impala coupe, a 1967 Camaro, a 1967 Ford Thunderbird, a Volkswagen Beetle and a Jeep Willys. Models were often available in a stock, police, or taxi livery. Some of these, like the Barracuda, Charger, Torino and GTO are more rare and sought after. Israel Unique to an Israeli product, models were often seen with United Nations markings, Israeli Army and Israeli Defense Force markings, the Star of David and Hebrew lettering (Rixon 2005, p. 37). Marketing emphasized Israeli desires to be accepted as a mainstream toy producer (if not a world class country) in the international market (Celebrate Rosh 2013; Zohar 2005). Markings on the cars were commonly transfer decals and not stickers. The Chevelle wagon was offered in UN (United Nations), IDF (Israel Defense Force), Israeli Army, Hassadah Medical ambulance, postal, Red Cross ambulance and fire chief liveries while the Impala was seen in several police guises and a couple of different taxi (monit) versions (Model Marque 2010; Rixon 2005, 37). The Jeep appeared with UN lettering. Gamda Sabra 1965 Plymouth Barracuda from the rear. Note that the bumper and body do not make a precise union. The Charger could be had with the United Nations globe and wreath seal on the doors, while the Eldorado and Riviera were available as Israeli Ministerial cars with doors displaying the shield with the menorah. Some of the cars like the Corvair, Camaro and Riviera were even described on packaging as a \\"tourist bureau car\\" or \\"Israeli President Car\\". Some cars, especially the Beetle, came with 1970s style 'hippie' flower decals, but the Bug also came in a German (surprisingly, not Israeli !) police version. Packaging and marketing Early Gamda Koor Sabra cars were marketed in a clear plastic box with a red 'garage door' to one end. The model in the box was secured on a yellow plastic base that incorporated a petrol pump at one end and a flap to hold the garage door closed. Clear boxes of the editions for the international market were backed with a white, red, and yellow card that said \\"Sabra Super Car\\" and included a collector coin and detail slip translated into twelve languages (Rixon 2005, p. 37; Celebrate Rosh 2013). Later cars had a darker blue card (Moncrief 2012). Later cars came with a cut- out puzzle for added play value (Moncrief 2012). Later, toy maker Cragstan wanted a piece of the diecast market that Corgi and Dinky had captured and enlisted Gamda Koor models for its international (and specifically American) sales. These models also used the garage door box, but often with a patriotic red, white and blue color scheme on the backing card and down the side of the box. Cragstan called its Sabra Super Cars, \\"Detroit Seniors\\". The Cragstan and Detroit Senior names were also molded into the plastic chrome bases of these cars. There were few differences between Sabra and Cragstan castings. One could be seen on the Chevelle wagon. The Chevrolet bow tie was shown on the sides behind the front wheel well, but on the Cragstan version it is missing. The Cragstan cars went for $1.49 in the US market, but did not bear the standard Israeli police, army and post symbols (Bickford 2013). Not seen elsewhere The Sabra line-up was unique in that many cars done by Gamda Koor in 1:43 scale were not attempted by manufacturers anywhere else (Goranson 2008). The Charger, Barracuda, Corvair, Impala, Cadillac and Riviera do not seem to be second-hand tooling from any other European manufacturer. Considering the uniqueness of the tooling and the Israeli presentation, the Sabra line comes off as fascinating and distinct in the world of miniature diecasts. Though the execution of the cars could have been better, the overall character and raison d'etre of these cars was lost on a famed Christie's auction house book whose authors simply called the Sabra cars \\"...on the whole, not good\\" with no other contextual comments (Richardson 1999, p. 161). The Chrysler Imperial convertible, at first glance, appears to be a casting from Corgi Toys (no. 246), but even cursory inspection shows they are quite distinct. The Corgi is smaller and a more customary 1:43 scale while the Gamda is larger, probably about 1:40. Lines and trim are distinct ‚Äì the Corgi has a crease line on hood and 'boot' missing from the Gamda, but the side profile of the Gamda appears more accurate. The metal of the Gamda body completely surrounds the windshield, while the Corgi is all plastic. Instead of having all features open, as the Corgi does, only the trunk opens on the Gamda, which was strange, but common on Sabra cars. The Olds Toronado may be similar to the Tekno version, but considering the above, is probably not Tekno tooling. The Charger, Impala, Thunderbird and the Imperial are similar in that all have only trunks that open. The Barracuda, Riviera, Toronado, Corvair, Corvette, and Mustang all have opening doors. The Impala was, intriguingly, made in a two-door and a four-door version ‚Äì the four-door appeared to just have an additional pillar added with four doors 'etched' (making the fit rather tight) in the metal. The fidelity of the shapes to the real cars was good, but not excellent. Perhaps the Riviera's and Barracuda's proportions are the best, while the Charger looks a bit stretched. The roof of the Corvette is a bit squarish and the opening doors on the Corvair look rather roundish compared to body panels they are supposed to match. Body lines are not smooth, with sometimes gravelly and uneven edges. Many of these cars have front and rear bumpers that are part of diecast plastic bases. Being such, many times the bumpers do not match up well with the diecast metal bodies, leaving gaps, as with the Barracuda shown above (Goranson 2008). Wheels were simple and unadorned indented silver metal discs with protruding axle ends. Some later cars had plastic five-spoke 'star' chrome wheels. References *Bickford, Keith. 2013.

The church was consecrated on October 24, 1179 and the abbey was ruled by Cistercians until the suppression of religious orders in the Kingdom of Naples by Joseph Bonaparte in 1807. The following monasteries were subservient to the abbey: Santa Maria dell'Arco (Sicily), Santo Spirito della Valle (Apulia), Santa Maria Incoronata (Apulia) and Santi Vito e Salvo (Abruzzo).

Numerous horror movies feature the theme of transplanted body parts that are evil or give supernatural powers, with examples including Body Parts, Hands of a Stranger, and The Eye. Organ transplants from donors who are unwilling, or incapable of objecting, to having their organs removed are a recurring theme in dystopian fiction. In contrast to unwilling organ donors, there is the theme of individuals who want to donate their own life-critical organs, such as a brain or heart, at the cost of their own life.  Organ theft  The term \\"organlegging\\" was coined by Larry Niven in a series of short stories set in his Known Space future universe originally published in a 1976 collection called The Long ARM of Gil Hamilton, later expanded and re-released as Flatlander. The story The Patchwork Girl was also published alone as a novel in 1986. In Robin Cook's 1978 novel Coma, set in the present day, the organ thieves operate in a hospital, removing the organs from patients in a facility for the long-term care of patients in a vegetative state. The story was also made into a film, Coma in 1978, and later into a two-part television miniseries aired in 2012 on the A&E; television network. Organ theft is a theme in a number of horror movies, including Turistas, and also (in a less overtly horrific manner) as a theme in realistic dramas such as Dirty Pretty Things and Inhale. In the TV series, Trigun, the protagonist's severed left arm had been transplanted without his knowledge onto an antagonist's left shoulder.  State-sanctioned organ transplants from criminals  The same series of Larry Niven stories also contains the theme of organ donation from criminals becoming institutionalized within society to the point where even minor crimes are punished by death, in order to ensure the supply of new organs to an aging population. Niven originally developed this theme in his novel A Gift From Earth, first published in 1968 and also set in his Known Space universe. In A Gift From Earth, the descendants of colonists from an interstellar colonization mission are preyed upon by the descendants of the crew, who enact laws that make even the most minor offences carry the death penalty to allow their organs to be \\"harvested\\" and stored in \\"organ banks\\" for later use. The theme had previously been explored by Frederik Pohl and Jack Williamson in their 1964 novel The Reefs of Space, the first novel of their Starchild Trilogy, in which mankind labours under the \\"Plan of Man\\", enforced by computers within a surveillance state. Unlike in Niven's novels, donors are kept alive for as long as possible to enable more organs to be removed for transplant until they eventually succumb from their injuries. The novel also features a Frankenstein-like theme of a man assembled entirely from the body parts of others. In Sui Ishida's 2014 dark fantasy manga series, Tokyo Ghoul, a state sanctioned organ transplant is performed between an unwilling donor and the main character of the series. It was the subject of much controversy in the series itself. Unbeknown to the surgeons however, the unwilling donor was a ghoul, a monster who eats human flesh, causing the main character to have ghoul-like characteristics.  Organ transplants from victims raised to be organ donors  The idea of state-sanctioned involuntary organ transplants is taken one step further by the concept of creating people solely for the purpose of acting as organ donors. Generally, these donors are clones of their eventual organ recipients. This idea has been explored by several writers. The 1979 science fiction horror film Parts: The Clonus Horror, written by Bob Sullivan and Ron Smith, is set in an isolated community in a remote desert area, where clones are bred to serve as a source of replacement organs for the wealthy and powerful. The clones are kept in a seemingly idyllic environment of apparent leisure and luxury, right up to the point where they are killed for their organs. Michael Marshall Smith's novel Spares has a similar premise. Unlike the clones in Parts: The Clonus Horror, the clones are kept in conditions resembling those of farm animals or a concentration camp. The central character of Alfred Slote's 1982 children's book Clone Catcher pursues clones who seek to escape their fate of being harvested for their organs. The 2005 American science fiction action thriller film The Island continues the theme, where clones live in a highly structured environment isolated in a compound. After the movie's hero learns that the compound inhabitants are clones who are used for organ harvesting and surrogate motherhood for wealthy people in the outside world, he escapes. Kazuo Ishiguro's 2005 dystopian novel Never Let Me Go also has a similar theme to its predecessors, but lacks the action-adventure theme of the previous works, concentrating on the characters' feelings and personal stories and the development of psychological horror at their plight. It was later made into a 2010 British drama film of the same name. Recently, a commission for Radio 7, (now called BBC radio 4 Extra), called Jefferson 37 by Jenny Stephens also explores the same theme in a four-part radio play. The whole plot takes place within Abbotsville, a free range laboratory, where the clones are deliberately dehumanised. The story culminates with their humanity resisting the desire to quash it. The plot of Unwind, a 2007 science fiction novel by young adult literature author Neal Shusterman, takes place in the United States, after a civil war somewhere in the near future. After a civil war is fought over abortion, a compromise was reached, allowing parents to sign an order for their children between the ages of 13 and 18 years old to be \\"unwound\\"‚Äîtaken to \\"harvest camps\\" and having their body parts harvested for later use. The reasoning was that, since all their organs were required to be used, unwinds did not technically die, because their individual body parts lived on.  Organ repossession  The idea of the repossession of transplanted organs has also been used in fiction, in the films Repo Men, and Repo! The Genetic Opera.  Self-sacrificial organ donation  In the film John Q., the character played by Denzel Washington takes a hospital hostage in hopes to force the surgical staff to transplant his heart into his dying son. In the TV series Psycho Pass, the antagonist is given the opportunity to donate his brain to help power a system that determines if an someone is likely to perform a crime.  Comedy  Organ transplantation has also been used as a major plot element in a number of comedies, including Przek≈Çadaniec (1968, Poland), The Thing with Two Heads (1972) and The Man With Two Brains (1983).

It is a taught doctoral programme designed for working professionals in the area of diplomacy and multilateral diplomacy or for those wishing to pursue a career in international relations. The programme focuses on applied theories and concepts which bring relevancy and day-to-day practice into the learning environment. The concept of a professional doctorate in diplomacy was first devised by The London Academy of Diplomacy in 2014 to help professionals make sense of their experiences and to develop their skills and competencies as practising diplomats. Besides undertaking studies in specialist subjects, students finish with a work-based project or applied research thesis which makes a direct contribution to diplomatic practice.  Purpose of a Professional Doctorate of Diplomacy  The role and responsibilities of diplomats has changed dramatically in recent years and has become something more than the diplomacy of states and governments.Siracusa, J.M., Diplomacy: a very short introduction, Oxford University Press, 2014 Globalisation, international trade developments, and our increasing interdependencies ‚Äì not to mention dramatic shifts in the balance of power ‚Äì mean that today‚Äôs diplomat needs to have at his/her finger tips a vast amount of knowledge and an array of skills that is unprecedented.Barston, R.P., Modern Diplomacy, Routledge, 2014 This requires a new way of thinking about how to train diplomatsMifsud J., Diplomacy & Development in a Global Environment; Speech given at The Organization of American States, November 2013 Designed with the working professional in mind, the Professional Doctor of Diplomacy programme is especially designed to align professional competence with academic principles and to develop transferable skills to meet the needs of today‚Äôs diplomat. The aim of the taught doctorate in diplomacy is to find fresh approaches of integrating professional practice and academic knowledge, and to produce a qualification which, whilst being equivalent in status and challenge to a PhD, is more appropriate for working professionals and those pursuing professional rather than academic careers.  Contribution, Inquiry and Research  Students make a significant contribution to the advancement of knowledge in the diplomatic field while studying part-time and remaining at work. Choosing a taught doctorate in diplomacy over a PhD brings a day-to-day relevancy of applied learning to problem solving, applying theory to diplomatic issues compared with a PhD that aims to create new knowledge. However, students undertaking a professional taught doctorate are expected to make a contribution to both theory and practice in their field. They work collaboratively with faculty and practitioners from the field to study a contemporary problem in diplomacy. Bringing together a strong combination of experiences and perspectives to understanding the problem, the student‚Äôs work culminates in developing professional practice by making a contribution to professional competence/knowledge. Therefore, the professional Doctor of Diplomacy programme has the three-fold purpose of: (1) contributing to both theory and practice in relation to diplomacy; (2) developing professional competence in the field of diplomacy; and (3) contributing to professional knowledge. The degree is conferred when all coursework and written research are completed and reviewed and approved by Stirling University, the awarding institution.  Suitability, Enrolment and Admission  Typical entry requirements include PhDs, master's degrees, or equivalent qualifications in a functional field awarded by a professional body. Significant experience is also required. Therefore, typical candidates are: * Ambassadors * Heads of mission * Heads of Protocol * Heads of NGOs * Directors from Organisations such as WTO, Red Cross, UNESCO, etc. * Ministers & Assistant Ministers from ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, Environment, etc. * Members of Think Tanks Candidates, having already risen to a senior position in their field, undertake the programme to gain a higher level of reflective personal development rather than with the expectation of immediate career advancement (as with perhaps a DBA). For career diplomats, the Doctor of Diplomacy qualification is seen as a positive summation of their professional development.  Structure and format  Providing a part-time structure of rigorous, concentrated study, ongoing research practice and continual, practical assessment, the course combines distance learning with the advantages of face-to-face study. The Professional Doctor of Diplomacy is designed to fit into a busy schedule whilst ensuring that students have the support and guidance needed to help translate their knowledge and experience into proper academic thinking and writing. The taught element of the programme consists of six face-to-face modules taken over two years when students get to meet, network and share ideas. In the third year, DDipl candidates will then specialise in areas such as cross-border and cyber security, diplomacy of the global economic system, failed states and civil conflicts, human security risks, during the project phase of the course. According to the European higher education standards set by the Bologna Process, it is stated that the normal duration of a doctorate should correspond to 3‚Äì4 years of full-time study. A highly experienced practitioner candidate should be able to complete this taught doctorate within that time-frame.

While Frank's family, including sister Elizabeth, remained there, he was sent to Prague for schooling. After six years at the Mozart Dramatic College, he joined the military, rising to the rank of lieutenant in the 7th Hussars. Acceding to his mother's wishes, he resigned from the military to become an actor. He joined her on the stage for performances in several European cities, before moving to Milan, where he received additional study in music and drama at the Academy of Music before returning to the stage for four years in Germany. Film career Erlanger took an interest in the film industry, and left the stage to spend four years with a German film company, the Kinematographic Kunst Company. He interrupted his acting career to travel to South America as part of a gold prospecting expedition. His placer mining there was financially successful, earning him $60,000, the equivalent of over $1,500,000 in present-day terms. However, he lost that money over the next two years in unsuccessful prospecting efforts in California and subsequently returned to film. Erlanger worked for many of the studios of the silent film era, including Universal, Kinemacolor, Essanay, Majestic, and the California Motion Picture Corporation, but he received his greatest fame with the Balboa Amusement Producing Company.

Since its inception in 1996 it has been a member of the Specialist Fraud Panel and has grown into a top-tier firm in multiple fields. It has represented defendants in several high-profile cases including the largest ever alleged insider dealing case, the Polly Peck International (formerly a constituent of the FTSE100) thefts, and Ian Edmondson in the News International phone hacking scandal. Notably, Bark&co; are one of a select few firms, along with several Magic Circle firms, that do not include the company type in their name. Notable cases  Libor Scandal  Bark&co; represented one of six defendants, Noel Cryan, in the Libor scandal. In January 2016 all six defendants were cleared of all charges after a two-year battle and the case banded a \\"shambles.\\" News International phone hacking scandal Bark&co; was instructed by Ian Edmondson, former News of The World Editor, in the News International phone hacking scandal. Murder of Daniel Morgan Bark & Co represented Glenn Vian, who over the course of nearly twenty years has repeatedly been accused of the highly publicised murder of a private investigator in 1987. Mr Vian was eventually charged with this offence in 2008, and held on remand for over two years. The case against Mr Vian was constructed around a number of \\"supergrass\\" witnesses\\" who the defence were, following painstaking work, able to discredit, one by one, until the case ultimately collapsed. During the course of the case preparation, the defence were able to demonstrate over fifty other suspects and motives which the police, over the course of no less than five investigations, failed to investigate either properly or, in multiple cases, at all. At the conclusion of the case, Mr Vian wrote to Bark & Co saying: ‚ÄúMy name is Glenn Vian. I have recently been acquitted of murder at the C.C.C. I have been very lucky as I was represented by the best team of solicitors you could possibly find Bark & Co. I cannot say enough about this firm, other than look nowhere else. They are the best. Their investigation team were brilliant. Thanks to Eamon Harris and Fred Bunn. All of these Solicitors are top drawer: Giles Bark-Jones, Jenny etc. Giles has no problem obtaining the best QCs because of Bark‚Äôs reputation and the team behind them. I was again fortunate to get the best QC‚Äôs David Whitehouse QC and Ed Gritt QC, absolutely brilliant men. Which brings me to my solicitor Alison Hill, her brilliant legal mind and determination to uncover and get the truth goes above and beyond. So a very special thanks to Alison Hill and Eamon Harris for giving me back the rest of my life. God bless you all at Bark & Co Glenn Vian‚Äù Murder of Melanie Hall Bark&co; was instructed to represent an alleged suspect in the Murder of Melanie Hall following his arrest in November 2013. Two years later in November 2015, without charge, detectives asked the Crown Prosecution Service for a decision on charging.

This technology is actually a merging of several Level 1 self-driving car technologies, such as Adaptive Cruise Control, Side Assist, Lane Assist, and Park Assist that are utilize to effectively achieve a Level 3 operation, the single environment in which the vehicle operates automatically being when it infers that there is an emergency. Most vehicle manufacturers now offer an Emergency Driver Assistant feature on their more recent, high-end models, taking advantage of the standardization of low-level driver assistance systems in such models. Such manufacturers include Tesla, Inc., Volkswagen, and Audi. A level 3 vehicle is actually considered the first tier of highly automated vehicles, so vehicles equipped with this technology could be considered automated vehicles, although only in a very limited sense. Automated vehicles have what are referred to as Operational Design Domains (ODDs) which are individual sets of conditions under which the vehicle can operate automatically. The primary difference between Level 3 automated vehicles and higher levels of automation is that a Level 3 can only operate in one particular set of conditions, or ODD. Such conditions might be on a highway with limited access, during the daytime with no inclement weather, at a certain speed. The ODD under which the Emergency Driver Assistant system is operating is even more narrowly define, simply being a time frame within which the vehicle controls have not be operated while the vehicle is in motion and the functionality is to bring the vehicle to a stop safely rather than any prolonged driving activity. Emergency Driver Assistant technology continues to be one of the most popular driver assistance technologies and, along with other assorted driver assistance technologies, are posed to become ubiquitous within the next decade. This popularity is considered by many experts to be the path forward for acclimating the public to automated vehicle technology and eventually full automation, especially amongst older drivers. This technology does have potential drawbacks, at least in the short term. Primarily, the success of the technology relies on a high market penetration rate; if it has low market penetration then it could potentially cause problems with drivers that are used to the presence of the technology not having it when they operate older vehicles. Additionally, there are driving environment situations in which the system would not be able to come to a safe stop, such as in dense traffic at high speed, and there is little information on how the system would handle this situation, especially given that prolonged operation would introduce too many variables for the system to compensate. Still, it bears mentioning that ubiquitous presence of such systems would be a net gain for traffic safety; the technology will aggregate some percentage of these types of emergencies, saving lives that would otherwise have been lost.

Career in Russia and Iran  Vsevolod Starosselsky was born into the family of Russian general Dmitry Staroselsky and Georgian princess Ekaterina Guramishvili (Guramova). He was raised in the liberal aristocratic milieu in Tiflis and trained at the Page Corps. He fought in the Savage Division during World War I, being put in command of the Kabarda Cavalry Regiment and promoted to the rank of colonel in 1916. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, he entered the service of Qajar Iran. In 1918, he became commander of the Persian Cossack Brigade, the only organized military unit in Iran, as a result of an internal coup within the brigade against its commander, Colonel Georgy Klerzhe, a suspected Bolshevik sympathizer. In this enterprise, Starosselsky was helped by the Iranian officer Reza Shah, the future shah of Iran, and tacitly supported by the United Kingdom. As historian Stephanie Cronin states, Staroselsky's primary objective in seizing command of and consolidating the Brigade after the chaos of 1917 was to preserve an instrument of Imperial Russian power in Iran while awaiting the victory of the Whites in the civil war. He exerted significance influence on the politics of Iran as he fought a military campaign against the Jangalis and their Bolshevik allies in Gilan, acceding to a dictatorial power in northern Iran. Around the same time, his relations with the British became increasingly soured and Starosselsky sought to eliminate the British influence in Tehran.  Downfall and emigration  By August 1920, Starosselsky's initially successful campaign against the Soviet- backed revolutionaries in Gilan suffered a setback. Having retaken Rasht, the Cossack Brigade had to retreat in the face of the Soviet reinforcements landing at Enzeli. In October 1920, Starosselsky's positions were further undermined by the arrival of Edmund Ironside, who took command of the British forces in Iran. Starosselsky was soon removed from his position by the shah Ahmad Shah Qajar through the efforts of the British agents, who accused him of appropriating part of the soldiers' pay, bribing the shah in order to advance his ambitions, and of being ready to betray the interests of Iran for Soviet Russia. Starosselsky emigrated to the United States, where he owned a ranch at Riverside, California, and died there of a stroke in 1935. He was buried at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Starosselsky owned a collection of Georgian and Oriental coins, which later passed into possession of the American Numismatic Society.

Originally from Kentucky, Edwards moved to New Orleans then settled in Texas. He smuggled slaves into Brazil in 1832 and used the proceeds to purchase land in Texas. In 1836, he was again smuggling slaves, this time into Texas. After attempting to swindle his partner out of the profits of the venture, partly with forged documents, Edwards was forced to flee the Republic of Texas to the United States. He then tried to scam money out of various abolitionists in the United States and the United Kingdom, partly with forged letters of introduction. He traveled to the United Kingdom, but his schemes were mainly unsuccessful and he returned to the United States in mid-1841. Edwards' largest swindle involved forged letters from cotton brokers in New Orleans which he used to secure bank drafts for large sums that he then cashed. His fabrications caught up with him, and he was arrested and tried for the forgeries in June 1842. Convicted partly because his distinctive good looks made him memorable and easily recognizable, and partly from making the same spelling errors in his fakes, Edwards was sentenced to 10 years in prison and died in 1847 while incarcerated. Several sensational accounts of his offenses and trial were published after his death, and he was mentioned in Herman Melville's 1853 short story \\"Bartleby, the Scrivener\\". Early life Edwards was born in 1808 in Danville, Kentucky. His father was reported to be Amos or Moses Edwards, but his mother's name is unknown. He had a brother Amos and an uncle, Haden, who lived in Nacogdoches.Muir \\"Union Company in Anahuac\\" Southwestern Historical Quarterly p. 265 Nothing is known with certainty of his childhood. As a grown man, he was considered very handsome, and usually dressed fashionably.Thompson \\"Edwards, Monroe\\" American National Biography Online Some accounts give him the title \\"Colonel\\".Barrows William M. Evarts pp. 21‚Äì23 Around 1822, Edwards was sent to New Orleans to learn business from a merchant named Mr. Morgan. By the late 1820s, Morgan had established a trading post on San Jacinto Bay near Galveston in what was then Mexican Texas. Sometime after, Edwards met a slave trader and joined his new acquaintance on a smuggling trip to acquire slaves in Africa. This first effort ended when they were shipwrecked, but on a second attempt in 1832 they succeeded in smuggling slaves into Brazil. Edwards invested this venture's profits into land in Texas, where in late 1833 he established a plantation on the San Bernard River in present-day Brazoria County, Texas;Robbins \\"Origin and Development of the African Slave Trade\\" East Texas Historical Journal p. 158 he named his new home \\"Chenango\\". Unconnected with his slave trading, Edwards was arrested in 1832 as part of the Anahuac Disturbances, and was briefly imprisoned during the uprising against the Mexican government which ruled Texas.Rowe \\"Disturbances at Anahuac\\" Quarterly p. 280 Slave trading and forgery Edwards' next efforts in smuggling involved a new partner, Christopher Dart, a lawyer from Natchez, Mississippi. In 1835 Dart invested $40,000 to buy the contracts of indentured blacks in Cuba and smuggle them into Texas as slaves. Instead of providing money for the partnership, Edwards' contribution was land certificates. At the time, Texas was a Mexican border province. In 1829, Mexico had abolished slaveryValdes \\"Decline of Slavery in Mexico\\" Americas p. 194 as well as the importation of slaves, but gave Texas an exemption from emancipating slaves who were already in the territory. To circumvent the ban on importing slaves, traders instead reclassified them as indentured servants with 99-year contracts. The Mexican government cracked down on this practice in 1832, limiting terms of indenture to a maximum of 10 years.Lack \\"Texas Revolutionary Experience\\" p. 4 Edwards secured further financing from a New Orleans company named George Knight and Company and then went to Cuba where he purchased slaves. In February 1836 Edwards landed 170 black people in Texas, taking advantage of the confusion surrounding the end of the Texas Revolution and the establishment of the independent Republic of Texas, which had not yet outlawed the importation of slaves. William Fisher, the customs collector on the Brazos River, wrote to the Texas Constitutional Convention that Edwards did not report the importation to the authorities, and Fisher went to Edwards' plantation to confront Edwards. Because of uncertainty about the legality of importing slaves, Fisher did not seize the slaves but referred the issue to the newly formed Texas Government after securing a monetary bond from Edwards. Although the new Texas Republic eventually outlawed the importation of slaves from anywhere but the United States, Edwards' landing of slaves from Cuba in early 1836 was never prosecuted. After this, Edwards also established a slave market on Galveston Bay, near present- day San Leon. In 1837, he was sued by Robert Peebles for fraud involving the sale of a slave with tuberculosis to Peebles. Peebles won the case.Kelley \\"Blackbirders\\" Civil War History p. 418 Edwards then tried to change the deal with Dart. Instead of dividing the smuggled slaves between the two men, Edwards tried to keep all the slaves and instead repay the money Dart had advanced him, with some interest. Dart sued, and at the trial in March 1839 Edwards offered two forged documents claiming that Dart had sold his interest in the slaves to Edwards. In forging the documents, Edwards originally secured Dart's signature on a document written in a type of ink that could later be chemically removed. After Dart signed the document, Edwards then removed the original wording of the document and substituted a deed selling Dart's interest in the land and slaves. The documents were determined to be forgeries and on April 2, 1840, Dart was awarded $89,000. Edwards fled the Republic of Texas to the United States. As part of a plot to discredit both Dart and the government of Texas, Edwards persuaded some abolitionists in Cincinnati to give him money with which he would supposedly liberate the slaves on his plantation in Texas, which he no longer owned. Edwards also tried to get money from the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in New York, but its leader, Lewis Tappan, did not trust him and Edwards did not receive any money. Edwards then went to England, bearing forged letters of introduction from, among others, Daniel Webster and the American Secretary of State, John Forsyth.Denham \\"Peerless Wind Cloud\\" East Texas Historical Journal p. 13 One of these letters was to Lord Spencer, who was so impressed he gave Edwards ¬£250 as a loan. While in England, Edwards defrauded a company in Liverpool of about $20,000, and then used part of the funds to repay Lord Spencer. The Republic of Texas ambassador in London warned the English government against Edwards. Tappan also sent warnings, so Edwards was unable to acquire more money in England and had returned to the United States by June 1841. Final scheme Edwards' next fraudulent scheme involved forging letters to cotton brokers in New Orleans and using the signatures obtained from their replies to forge letters to brokers in New York City, saying that the fake John Caldwell ‚Äì Edwards' alias ‚Äì had a large amount of cotton on deposit with the New Orleans brokers. Edwards used those letters to secure fraudulent loans from brokers on the security of the non-existent cotton. Two New York brokers ‚Äì Brown Bros. & Co. and Jacob Little ‚Äì gave Edwards bank drafts for $25,000 each. Edwards then cashed the drafts pretending to be Caldwell, but without attempting to disguise his appearance. Unluckily for Edwards, in September 1841 Brown Brothers was informed by the New Orleans brokers that there was no cotton on account for Caldwell,Kouwenhoven Partners in Banking p. 77 and this prompted the bankers to offer a reward for information on the forger. The police began to search for the forger of the letters but were unsuccessful until Edwards attempted to distract their attention to an acquaintance, Alexander Powell, who happened to look much like him. Edwards sent an anonymous letter to the New York police, stating that the forger they were hunting was sailing to England, as Powell was about to do. Edwards assumed that by the time the police acted, Powell's ship would already have sailed. The ship was delayed and the police were able to catch Powell, who told them that Edwards was their forger. After his arrest, Edwards was imprisoned in the Tombs, New York City's jail. When he was arrested, he had more than $44,000 in a trunk in his room.Dillingham Melville's Short Fiction pp. 51‚Äì52 While in jail awaiting trial, Edwards forged a letter alleging he had funds in New Orleans, and then showed the letter to one of his lawyers in order to reassure the lawyer about Edwards' ability to pay for legal counsel. In an attempt to delay his trial, Edwards also forged a letter from a supposed witness, Charles Johnson, stating that he was in Cuba and would not be able to come and testify for Edwards for a while; this gained Edwards a three-month delay.Barrows William M. Evarts pp. 24‚Äì27 Trial Depiction of Edward's trial, from Life and Adventures of the Accomplished Forger and Swindler, Colonel Monroe Edwards Edwards' trial was in June 1842 and was a media sensation. He secured a defense team of six lawyers, including John J. Crittenden, a sitting U.S. Senator, and Thomas F. Marshall, a sitting U.S. Representative. Both Crittenden and Marshall absented themselves from their legislative duties during the trial. One of the junior lawyers was William M. Evarts, who presented the opening remarks for the defense.Dyer Public Career of William M. Evarts p. 12 Another defense lawyer was John Worth Edmonds, whom Edwards paid with a forged check.Wilson \\"Sympathy for the Lawyer\\" ANQ pp. 25‚Äì26 Edwards' handsome appearance worked against him, when one of the bankers who had cashed the drafts identified him in court and remarked that he remembered Edwards because of his striking good looks. Edwards had also neglected to dispose of a marked bank bag from one of the banks that cashed the fraudulently obtained draft. A final tie-in was the commonality of misspellings between letters from Edwards and the forged letters. The trial ended with Edwards being convicted and given a 10-year prison sentence. The trial's proceedings were published by a New York newspaper, The Herald, and ran to 50,000 copies. None of Edwards' lawyers were ever paid for their services. He was sent to Sing Sing prison, where he attempted to use forged letters to escape. Edwards died in prison on January 27, 1847, of consumption. He was insane at the time of his death. Legacy Edwards earned a mention in Herman Melville's story \\"Bartleby, the Scrivener\\". Melville used the names of contemporaneous events and people to give a contemporary feel to his short stories.Dillingham Melville's Short Fiction pp. 14‚Äì15 One of his characters is imprisoned in the Tombs with the main character, and he asks if he is a \\"gentleman forger\\" like Edwards. The career of Melville's narrator in \\"Bartleby\\" parallels that of Edmonds, who defended Edwards then went on to be the prison inspector at Sing Sing during Edwards' prison term and was known for his attempts to improve the treatment of the prisoners. Melville's narrator also tries to secure better treatment for Bartleby. The narrator's description of Bartleby just prior to death \\"eerily echoed\\" the state of Edwards just prior to his death, in the words of Robert Wilson. Edwards was known as the \\"Great Forger\\" during and after his trial. The main account of his life and trial is Life and Adventures of the Accomplished Forger and Swindler, Colonel Monroe Edwards, which was written by an editor of the National Police Gazette in 1848, probably by George Wilkes. It is the fullest account of Edwards' life but mingles fact with fiction to the extent that it has been listed in bibliographies of American fiction. Wilkes' account is the source for the story of Kitty Clover, supposedly a slave who loved Edwards, rescued him, and followed him throughout his life. There are other accounts, including two anonymous narratives published in 1842.

History A Marine stands watch during mass on Hill 950 The base was located approximately 3.5 km north of Khe Sanh. The base was first established by the Marines in late 1966. In May 1967 the site was defended by a company from the 1st Battalion, 26th Marines. On the morning of 6 June a People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) force attacked the base, but were forced back for the loss of 6 Marines and 10 PAVN killed. CPL John Roland Burke would be posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his actions during the battle. In September 1969 as part of Operation Keystone Cardinal the 4th Marines abandoned the base as part of the withdrawal of the 3rd Marine Division from Vietnam. The base was later used as an operations base and radio relay site to allow SOG teams to remain in contact while on operations in Laos and to monitor sensors emplaced on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The base also housed the Army Security Agency's (ASA) Explorer VHF automated interception system linked to the Phu Bai Combat Base. On the morning of 4 June 1971 a PAVN force on Hill 1015 attacked the base with small arms and mortars.

On the morning of 5 June the PAVN launched a final assault, overrunning the base, while many of the Bru managed to escape, Cavaianai and Jones held out in a bunker until Jones was killed and Cavaiani was taken prisoner. Cavaiani was released in April 1973, he would be awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the battle. Current use The base has reverted to jungle.

(Hans) van Heijningen (born 15 March 1953) is a Dutch politician. He was party secretary of the Socialist Party (SP), a position comparable to the post of chairman in other parties. Before holding this office, Van Heijningen was a foreign policy advisor to the SP whose areas of responsibility included European politics, and development cooperation.  Biography  Van Heijningen attended high school at the Stanislas College in Delft and from 1972 to 1979 studied sociology at the University of Amsterdam. During his military service he was active in the national servicemen‚Äôs union, the VVDM, serving for a year as a member of the national executive. From 1984 to 1992 Van Heijningen lived in Nicaragua, where his then girlfriend ‚Äì she is now his wife ‚Äì worked as a general practitioner in the mountain village of Comalapa in the Department of Chontales. Initially he was employed as a journalist and consultant, in addition to which he was a volunteer in education, took part in vaccination campaigns in settlements in the mountains and organised support for farmers‚Äô cooperatives, which were being attacked by the Contras. As a result of these activities he was asked by the Nicaraguan authorities to help in establishing contacts with western development organisations. In 1988, on the basis of a contract with the Dutch Volunteers‚Äô Foundation, he became a policy advisor to the Sandinista government as a policy advisor. Following the Sandinistas‚Äô defeat in the 1990 elections Van Heijningen led a research project into the peasantry‚Äôs involvement both in the Sandinista revolution and with the US- backed armed Contra rebels. This research project and the political education programme which grew out of it formed part of the successful efforts on the part of the Sandinista Party (FSLN) to put an end to war-related violence and move towards the normalisation of social and political relations. Following his return to the Netherlands Van Heijningen worked on a dissertation on peasant resistance to the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. On 5 December 1994 he was awarded his doctorate after a successful defence before Professor Gerrit Huizer at the Catholic University of Nijmegen. From 1998 to October 2005 Van Heijningen was coordinator of the XminY Solidarity Fund. In this capacity he was involved in the action group Keer het Tij (Turn the Tide), in campaigns for peace in Afghanistan and Iraq with the action group Platform tegen de Nieuwe Oorlog (Platform against the New War), and with the foundation Stop de Uitverkoop van de Beschaving (Stop the Sell-off of Civilisation). He was joint initiator of ATTAC Nederland, which was for several years an active participant in the movement against neoliberal globalisation. It was during this period that he joined the SP, standing as the 13th placed candidate on the party‚Äôs list for the parliamentary elections of 2003. Following a disappointing result which saw him fail to be elected, Van Heijningen joined the SP‚Äôs parliamentary staff as an advisor on foreign policy. In his capacity as founder of the Comit√© Grondwet Nee (Committee for a No to the Constitution), in the referendum of 2005 he played a significant role in the successful campaign against the European Constitution. Later that month, on 20 June 2005, Van Heijningen, at the 13th Congress of the SP, was elected party secretary, with responsibility for everything which affects the party‚Äôs organisation.  ‚ÄòPies and firearms‚Äô  On 23 August 2003 the journalists Peter Siebelt and Martijn Koolhoven suggested in the Dutch national newspaper De Telegraaf, under the headline \\"SP'er betaalde taartactie tegen Pim\\" (\\"SP member paid for pie demonstration against Pim\\") that Van Heijningen had financed the bombardment with pies of Pim Fortuyn on 14 March 2002, about a month and a half before the populist right-wing leader was murdered. As coordinator of XminY he would have been responsible for paying a subsidy of ‚Ç¨450 to a Give-away shop in Hoenderloo. Later, two people who worked for the organisation which ran the shop were arrested in connection with the \\"pie-ing\\" of Fortuyn. In December 2003, following a complaint from Van Heijningen, the Raad voor de Journalistiek (Journalism Council), the body responsible for upholding journalistic standards in the Netherlands, issued the following ruling: 'This report represents such a stain on the (character of) the complainants (Van Heijningen and the SP - ed.) that it should not have been published without a proper factual basis. Since any such basis is lacking, the defendants have, with the publication of this headline, overstepped the bounds.‚Äôdr. J.G.C. van Heijningen en de SP tegen M.

From the pen of publicist Peter Siebelt and De Telegraaf journalists Martijn Koolhoven and Joost de Haas, numerous articles have appeared over the years in which Van Heijningen has been linked with the [extreme left] movement in the Netherlands and the armed struggle in Nicaragua. During his time in Nicaragua Van Heijningen would have borne arms, including a Kalashnikov, supplied to him by the Sandinistas.SP-topman deed met AK-47 aan ontwikkelingswerk De Telegraaf (in Dutch), 19 July 2008 By his own account, however, he never took part in armed actions against the Contras.

The family was created in 2009 after a revision of the \\"robust\\" families of Faviidae, Merulinidae, Mussidae and Pectiniidae, which had been shown to be polyphyletic. The family Lobophylliidae was formed out of the Indo-Pacific species that had traditionally been included in Mussidae, and some of the species which had previously formed Pectiniidae, the remaining species from Pectiniidae having been merged into Merulinidae. The type genus is Lobophyllia. Taxonomy The \\"robust\\" stony coral families of Faviidae, Merulinidae, Mussidae and Pectiniidae, have traditionally been recognised on morphological grounds but recent molecular analysis has shown that these families are polyphyletic, the similarities between the species having occurred through convergent evolution. Additionally, some traditional genera such as Favia and Scolymia have been found to be polyphyletic, with the Atlantic faviids and scolymids being more closely related to each other than they are to their Indo-Pacific relatives. A revised classification, proposed in 2012, places the Pacific species of Mussidae in a new family, Lobophylliidae and retains the taxon Mussidae for the Atlantic species. In the revision, the genera Echinomorpha, Echinophyllia and Oxypora were transferred to Lobophylliidae from Pectiniidae and the genus Moseleya from elsewhere.

Education Wenzel was born in 1932 in Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania, USA). After receiving her degree in philosophy at Columbia University in New York in 1957, she continued her studies at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, where she received her PhD in 1966 on the decorative motifs found on the medieval steƒáak tombstones of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Research Her research on Bosnia and Herzegovina in medieval times led to her collaboration with Alojz Benac, then director of the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as other renowned names in the field, including Vlajko Palavestra, ƒêuro Basler, ≈†efik Be≈°lagiƒá, Nada Miletiƒá, Pavao Anƒëelic, Marko Vego. Wenzel spent the early 1960s travelling throughout the country, documenting the motifs on the steƒáaks, resulting in her 1965 publication Ornamental Tombstones In Mediaeval Bosnia And Surrounding Regions. Her research (along with that of John Fine) also challenged the contemporary view that the Bosnian Church was adherent to Bogumilism, and she furthermore espoused the view that steƒáaks were the material culture of followers of the Catholic, Orthodox and Bosnian Churches within the region. She also argued that the Vlachs were the creators of the stecci.\\"Bosnian and Herzegovinian Tombstobes-Who Made Them and Why?\\" Sudost-Forschungen 21(1962): 102-143 Her primary focus of research then switched to metalworking, a craft from which she believed many of the recurring motifs apparent on steƒáak tombstones was derived, coining the term ‚ÄòBosnian Style‚Äô, for a style of metal ornamentation incorporating a mixture of Gothic, Mediterranean-Islamic and Byzantine.Wenzel, M. Bosnian Style in Metalwork and Tombstones. Oxbow, 1999. During the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Wenzel founded the charity Bosnia-Herzegovina Heritage Rescue (BHHR) which functioned until 2004, and visited the country on several occasions in the midst of hostilities. Painting Marian painted for most of her life, producing canvases of a style unusual for her generation. Rejecting the Abstract Expressionism then dominating the American and European art scene she used her knowledge of Ancient Greece, of Rome and of Byzantium to create work that focussed on the magical and mysterious world of classical religion and culture: Cretan bull-dancers in oil, five feet high, tangling with Mercury and enlivened by splashes of real gold; Roman beauties with the wistful expressions of their originals at Pompeii again peering through gold leaf; goddesses with added Renaissance glass appliqu√©. This is painting of a high intellectual and historical order that is accessible without in any way being obvious. Marian's spiritual, mystical and even magical beliefs come out in her canvases and can be related to her Automatic Writing and her belief in reincarnation. Writings Besides the academic publications listed under 'Research' above, Marian was a poet and a writer and illustrator of short stories. The best of these are channeled material she received in the shape of children's stories from the Egyptian god Alperas, son of Anubis ('Let's Not Be Afraid: Stories, as told by Alperas, son of Anubis, and Marian Wenzel', Blue Dragon Press, 1996.) The illustrations in these volume were produced automatically; Marian could talk about something else while letting her pen create drawings of which she had no conscious awareness. Death and legacy Marian Wenzel died from cancer in 2002 at the age of 69. Throughout her lifetime, she published over 30 essays on the cultural heritage of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as other titles of topics in the field of culture and art. After her death she bequeathed her personal archives to the History Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and her artworks to the National Gallery of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

It was named for Pierre Bottineau, a prominent Minnesota frontiersman and is one of 41 libraries in the Hennepin County Library System. The library moved to its current location at the historic Grain Belt campus in 2003. The facility combines two historic buildings, the 1893 Wagon Shed and the 1913 Millwright Shop, with an addition designed by RSP Architects. History The Northeast Minneapolis area had been served by the Minneapolis Public Library since 1913. The first library in the neighborhood was housed at Sheridan Junior High School; later, the library moved to the field house at Logan Park where it went by the name Logan Park Library. Pierre Bottineau's next incarnation was housed in a rented space at 1224 Northeast 2nd Street where it resided beginning in 1957. As of 2000, not only was it the system's only rented space but it was also the smallest at less than half the size of the lobby of the 1961 downtown Minneapolis Central Library. As Pierre Bottineau's capacity was legally set at only 40 occupants, a sign on the door would inform potential patrons that \\"The library is now full.\\" The Grain Belt location is six times the size of Pierre Bottineau's previous home and was proposed in 2000 by the Minneapolis Library Board. Support from the Minnesota Historical Society was necessary to proceed with renovations on the site as the Historical Society controlled the $500,000 earmarked for work on the Grain Belt site that the Minnesota Legislature had approved five years before. The total project cost was estimated at $2.5 million of which the Library Board was to pay half. Pierre Bottineau's move to the Grain Belt building was supported by the Sheridan Neighborhood Association and the Minneapolis Community Development Agency, the latter of which sought a grant to refurbish a next-door fountain and park. Work on the new facility began in 2002 with costs totaling $3.1 million. Emphasis in the library was placed on meeting the needs of children as the old Pierre Bottineau received heavy use from school-age youths. Pierre Bottineau opened May 31, 2003. Budget woes caused the Minneapolis Public Library to temporarily close three different branches in part due to a loss of local government aid in early 2007. A merger with the Hennepin County Libraries was approved by both systems' boards along with the Minneapolis City Council, and Pierre Bottineau reopened at 10 am on January 2, 2008, as a Hennepin County Library.

History  At the end of the 1920s, Jakob Gasser, a cactus grower from Z√ºrich, tried to sell his collection of about 1,500 succulents to the city government of Z√ºrich, but the venture failed. in 1929, Julius Brann Gassersche, a store owner, acquired the unique collection and made a gift of it to the city of Z√ºrich. The collection was housed in the greenhouses at the former site of the municipal gardens (Stadtg√§rtnerei) at Mythenquai, and established as St√§dtische Kakteensammlung, meaning urban cactus collection. Formally established in 1931, the collection houses one of the largest and most important collections of succulent plants. The main complex was built in 1947 and inaugurated in 1948. The succulent collection started in the existing greenhouse at Mythenquai, and was extended in 1948, 1954, 1961, 1984. In 2011, the entrance area was rebuilt and information for visitors improved. There are plans to redesign the Mythenquai area, including a renovation of the greenhouses.  Collection and structure  Succulents are plants from arid areas that survive by storing water, including Agaves, Aloes and stonecrop family, in addition to Cacti and thick leaf plants. The collection features more than 6,500 different types of succulent plants from more than 80 different plant families of Orchidaceae, Crassulaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Aizoaceae, Cactaceae and Apocynaceae. The collection is funded by Gr√ºn Stadt Z√ºrich and by the booster association, F√∂rderverein der Sukkulenten-Sammlung Z√ºrich. Although internationally known for its scientific objectives, the Sukkulenten-Sammlung is perceived by the public as a collection. Periodic special displays provide an insight into the survival mechanisms used by succulents.  Facilities  Surrounded by a park on the lake, the facilities house over 25,000 exotic plants in about 6,500 species and varieties on , including in six greenhouses, 16 heated cold frame boxes and an outdoor area. The staff consists of nine employees who take care of 50,000 visitors annually. The greenhouses are open daily.  IOS library, database and herbarium  Since about 1947, the institution has been involved in an international seed exchange between botanical institutes and gardens around the world. Currently, there are more than 200 botanical gardens involved. In addition, Sukkulenten-Sammlung houses a specialized library on succulent plants. These books are not allowed to leave the library, but can be seen when the collection is open. The library contains more than 30,187 titles. The herbarium was founded in 1950, simultaneously with the International Organizations for Succulent Plant Research (IOS), and has an extensive archive of plants with approximately 20,000 specimens and a meticulous tracking database. It is now under the patronage of the Swiss UNESCO commission.  F√∂rderverein association  Despite the uniqueness of the collection, in 1996 the municipal council (Gemeinderat) of the city of Z√ºrich sought to either outsource the collection of succulents or to close the collection entirely. This political pressure led to the founding of the boosting association F√∂rderverein der Sukkulenten-Sammlung Z√ºrich. The council then decided to suspend the motion, until it became clear whether the Canton of Z√ºrich and the federal authorities would become involved in co-financing.  Cultural heritage of national importance  Sukkulenten-Sammlung Z√ºrich is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class A object of national importance.

He competed in the trap event at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Biography At the age of 16, Fawcett ran away from home to join the U.S. Army, and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War took him to the Philippines. Back in Minnesota, he became a police reporter for the Minneapolis Journal. While a World War I Army captain, Fawcett's experience with the Army publication Stars and Stripes gave him the notion to get into publishing, and his bawdy cartoon and joke magazine, Captain Billy's Whiz Bang, became the launch pad for the vast Fawcett Publications publishing empire embracing magazines, comic books and paperback books.Thomas, Roy. \\"Captain Billy's Whiz Gang,\\" The Best of Xero. Tachyon Publications, 2004. The title Captain Billy's Whiz Bang combined Fawcett's military moniker with the nickname of a destructive World War I artillery shell. According to one account, the earliest issues were mimeographed pamphlets, typed on a borrowed typewriter and peddled around Minneapolis by Captain Billy and his four sons. However, in Captain Billy's version, he stated that when he began publishing in October 1919, he ordered a print run of 5,000 copies because of the discount on a large order compared with rates for only several hundred copies. Distributing free copies of Captain Billy's Whiz Bang to wounded veterans and his Minnesota friends, he then circulated the remaining copies to newsstands in hotels. With gags like, \\"AWOL means After Women Or Liquor\\", the joke book caught on, and in 1921, Captain Billy made the highly inflated claim that his sales were \\"soaring to the million mark.\\"Lequidre, Zorikh. Captain Marvel Culture. The book Humor Magazines and Comic Periodicals notes: > Few periodicals reflect the post-WW I cultural change in American life as > well as Captain Billy‚Äôs Whiz Bang. To some people [it] represented the > decline of morality and the flaunting of sexual immodesty; to others it > signified an increase in openness. For much of the 1920s, Captain Billy‚Äôs > was the most prominent comic magazine in America with its mix of racy poetry > and naughty jokes and puns, aimed at a small-town audience with pretensions > of \\"sophistication\\". Captain Billy's Whiz Bang is immortalized in the lyrics to the song \\"Trouble\\" from Meredith Willson's The Music Man (1957): \\"Is there a nicotine stain on his index finger? A dime novel hidden in the corncrib? Is he starting to memorize jokes from Captain Billy's Whiz Bang?\\" A drawing of Capt. Billy Fawcett, from the April 1923 Capt. Billy's Whiz Bang The publication, delivered in a 64-page, saddle-stitched, digest-sized format, soon saw a dramatic increase in sales. By 1923, the magazine had a circulation of 425,000 with $500,000 annual profits. With the rising readership of Captain Billy's Whiz Bang, Fawcett racked up more sales with Whiz Bang annuals, and in 1926, he launched a similar publication, Smokehouse Monthly. The popularity of Whiz Bang peaked during the 1920s. It continued into the 1930s, but circulation slowed as readers graduated to the more sophisticated humor of Esquire, founded in 1933. Whiz Bang had an influence on many other digest-sized cartoon humor publications, including Charley Jones Laugh Book, which was still being published during the 1950s. During the 1930s, Fawcett and his sons established a line of magazines which eventually reached a combined circulation of ten million a month in newsstand sales. True Confessions alone had a circulation of two million a month. Captain Billy's success as a publisher prompted him to create the Breezy Point ResortBreezy Point Resort on Pelican Lake in Breezy Point, Minnesota. Since celebrity visitors came to the resort, Captain Billy had the road from Breezy Point into Pequot Lakes blacktopped at his own expense. His building program at the Resort included the construction of a massive lodge, planned to accommodate 700 people, using native Norway pines, some in length. Celebrities who stayed at Breezy Point included Carole Lombard, Tom Mix and Clark Gable. The Fawcett House, Captain Billy's personal log mansion, is made available for public rental today. Decorated with elk and deer skins, Fawcett House has ten bedrooms and eight baths. The living room has a cathedral ceiling, a loft, a bar and a large field rock fireplace. Harry Truman was another Breezy Point guest. Edward McKim, a friend of Truman's since World War I, told of visits to the Resort in 1932 and Truman's success at the Breezy Point slot machine: > Captain Billy was quite a shot with a shotgun. He was on the American > Olympic team at one time. He had some traps out there, so we did a little > shooting with him. He had a couple of guests, one of whom was Dr. Joe Mayo, > the son of Dr. Charlie Mayo. Dr. Joe was killed a few years later in an > automobile accident. He was the brother of Dr. Chuck Mayo who just retired > from the Mayo Foundation. We did a little trap shooting at that time, but we > went up there almost every night for dinner. It was a 35 or drive. We > stopped at a barber shop at Brainerd going up, and he hit the jackpot in a > machine in the lower lobby of the hotel. Then he hit the jackpot up at > Breezy Point the same night. In some issues of Whiz Bang, Captain Billy wrote about his vacations in Los Angeles, Miami, New York and Paris, along with items about his celebrity friends, including Jack Dempsey, Sinclair Lewis, and Ring Lardner. Captain Billy and his wife Claire had four sons and one daughter: Roger, Wilford, Marion Claire, Gordon Wesley and the youngest, Roscoe. Wilford Fawcett died in 1940 in Hollywood, California.

Located on T√ºnel Square, just of ƒ∞stiklal Avenue, it is the northern and upper terminus of the railway. The station is located on the ground floor of the Metrohan Building, which serves as a administrative office building for the IETT. Overview Beyoƒülu station is located at street level on the ground floor of the Metrohan Building. The entrance is located on the northern side of the building on T√ºnel Square. Despite being at-grade, the track and platforms are at an angle facing into the ground and the tunnel begins where the two platforms end. The Spanish solution is used at Beyoƒülu, as one platform is for boarding passengers, while the other is for exiting passengers only. The station is integrated within the citywide smartcard system, Istanbulkart and turnstiles are located at the front entrance. Connection to the ƒ∞stiklal Avenue heritage tram line, to Taksim Square, is available just outside the station. About two blocks away is the ƒ∞stiklal Avenue entrance to the ≈ûi≈ühane metro station on the M2 line of the Istanbul Metro. Since Beyoƒülu is located within a mostly pedestrian area, no immediate connection to city buses is available. The closest bus stop is located about west on Refik Saydam Avenue. History The original 1875 Beyoƒülu station building. Beyoƒülu station, along with its counterpart Karak√∂y station, is one the oldest subterranean urban railway stations in the world. Construction began in the summer of 1871 and was completed in 1874, along with the rest of the railway line. Beyoƒülu station officially opened, along with T√ºnel, on 17 January 1875 as Pera station. A 5-story hotel building designed by the chief engineer of T√ºnel, Eug√®ne-Henri Gavand, was originally planned to be constructed on top of Beyoƒülu station. This was never realized and the station building remained a 2-story structure until 1914, when the Metrohan Building was constructed above it. Beyoƒülu station, along with T√ºnel, was taken over by the IETT, which continued operating the railway. In 1968, the station was closed down temporarily for the modernisation and electrification of the railway line. Once works completed, the station reopened on 2 November 1971. In 1990, the IETT opened a long heritage tram line along ƒ∞stiklal Avenue, which had its southwestern terminus just outside of Beyoƒülu station. Connection to the Istanbul Metro became available in 2009, when ≈ûi≈ühane station opened.

She represented the riding as a member of the Liberal party from 2015 to 2019 and as an independent since 2019. She served as Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada in the cabinet of Justin Trudeau from 2015 until January 2019 and then as Minister of Veterans Affairs of Canada from January 14, 2019, until resigning on February 12, 2019 over the SNC- Lavalin affair. Before entering Canadian federal politics, she was a Crown Prosecutor for British Columbia, a Treaty Commissioner and Regional Chief of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations.  Early life and education  Wilson- Raybould's mother is a Euro-Canadian and her father is a descendant of the Musgamagw Tsawataineuk and Laich-kwil-tach peoples, which are part of the Kwakwaka ºwakw, also known as the Kwak‚Äôwala-speaking peoples. She is a member of the We Wai Kai Nation. Wilson-Raybould carries the Kwak‚Äôwala name Puglaas which roughly translates to \\"woman born to noble people\\". Wilson-Raybould is the daughter of Bill Wilson, a First Nations hereditary chief, politician, and lawyer, and Sandra Wilson, a teacher. On Canadian national television in 1983, Wilson-Raybould's father informed then-Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau that his two daughters hoped to become lawyers and then Prime Minister some day. Born at Vancouver General Hospital, her parents divorced when Wilson- Raybould was a small child and she was raised by her mother on Vancouver Island, attending Robert Scott Elementary School in Port Hardy, British Columbia, where her mother also taught, and later Comox, British Columbia, graduating from Highland Secondary School. Wilson-Raybould studied political science and history at the University of Victoria where she was awarded her Bachelor of Arts degree in 1996. She then studied for a law degree from the University of British Columbia Faculty of Law. She married Dr. Tim Raybould (b. 1966), a First Nations consultant, lobbyist and social anthropologist, on November 29, 2008.  Career  Crown Prosecutor (2000‚Äì2003) Wilson- Raybould is a lawyer by profession and was called to the bar in 2000 after articling at the Vancouver law firm of Connell Lightbody. She was a provincial Crown prosecutor in Vancouver's Main Street criminal courthouse in the Downtown Eastside, Canada's poorest neighbourhood, for three years from 2000 to 2003. Defence lawyer Terry La Libert√© described her as a smart, fair, and skilled prosecutor who treated defendants with compassion, saying, \\"She has actually talked to the people who are affected. She has worked with these people and made choices about their future in a really meaningful way.\\" Wilson-Raybould called it an eye-opening experience, saying, ‚ÄúI always knew that there was an over-representation of indigenous peoples and vulnerable people in the criminal justice system but it became certainly more pronounced to me being down there for almost four years.\\" She also said her experience as a prosecutor reconfirmed her commitment to public service and its importance. B.C. Treaty Commission In 2003, she took a position as a process advisor at the B.C. Treaty Commission, a body established to oversee the negotiations of modern treaties between First Nations and the Crown. In 2004, she was elected commissioner by the chiefs of the First Nations Summit. She served as commissioner for nearly seven years, one and a half of which she spent as the acting chief commissioner, earning a reputation for bringing opposing sides together in the complex treaty negotiation process. City of Vancouver first- ever Aboriginal Relations Manager Ginger Gosnell-Myers, then a youth representative on roundtables Wilson-Raybould organized, said working with her as a young person \\"felt like I was being heard for the first time in a process that was normally exclusionary. She went out of her way to make sure that this diversity was reflected\\". As a Commissioner, she helped to advance a number of treaty tables, including Tsawwassen First Nation, which became the first in B.C. to achieve a treaty under the B.C. Treaty Process. Wilson-Raybould also helped the establishment of a \\"Common Table\\" of 60 plus First Nations and the Crown. We Wai Kai Council Wilson-Raybould was elected to council for the We Wai Kai Nation in January 2009, a role that she credits for strengthening her understanding and commitment to work at the provincial and national level advocating for First Nations' governance. As a councillor for We Wai Kai she was instrumental in helping her community develop a Land Code and to move out from under the Indian Act. As a result of this work she was appointed as her Nation's representative to the national First Nations Lands Advisory Board (LAB), and was subsequently elected from among her peers to sit as a board member for the LAB as well as a member of the Finance Committee. As councillor for We Wai Kai Nation, Wilson-Raybould was also central to We Wai Kai developing a financial administration law (establishing a transparency and accountability through regulatory framework for establishing budgets and controlling expenditures), assuming property taxation powers under the First Nations Fiscal Management Act and becoming a Borrowing Member of the First Nations Finance Authority (FNFA). Wilson-Raybould was appointed the We Wai Kai representative to the FNFA. The Borrowing Members of the FNFA elected Wilson- Raybould as the Chair in 2013, 2014 and 2015. The FNFA is a not-for-profit that pools the public borrowing requirements of qualifying First Nations and issues bonds on the strength of a central credit. Under Wilson-Raybould's chair, the FNFA issued its inaugural debenture in 2014 in the amount $96 million. This issue was reopened in 2015 adding an additional $50 million. B.C. Assembly of First Nations Wilson-Raybould was first elected Regional Chief of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations in 2009. The Regional Chief is elected by the 203 First Nations in B.C. She is credited with bringing the Chiefs together, which was reflected in her being re-elected Regional Chief in November 2012. She won on the first ballot with nearly 80% of the vote. As Regional Chief, Wilson-Raybould concentrated on the need for nation building, good governance, and empowering indigenous peoples to take the practical steps necessary to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to realize the promise of the recognition of aboriginal and treaty rights in section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. She focused on reconciliation between First Nations and the province of BC and Canada by advancing 1) the cause of First Nations' strong and appropriate governance, 2) fair access to lands and resources, 3) improved education and 4) individual health. In 2011 and 2012, Wilson-Raybould co-authored the BCAFN Governance Toolkit: A Guide to Nation Building. Part 1 of the Governance Toolkit ‚Äì The Governance Report, which has been acclaimed as the most comprehensive report of its kind in Canada, setting out what First Nations in B.C. are doing with respect to transitioning their governance from under the Indian Act to a post-colonial world based on recognition of aboriginal title and rights. In 2012, Wilson-Raybould and the BCAFN launched Part 2 of the Governance Toolkit ‚Äì The Governance Self-Assessment and Part 3 ‚Äì Guide to Community Engagement: Navigating Our Way Beyond the Post-Colonial Door. In 2014, a second edition of The Governance Report was released. In 2015, Wilson- Raybould and the BCAFN released A User's Guide to the BCAFN Governance Toolkit: Supporting Leaders of Change. Wilson-Raybould held portfolio responsibilities on the Assembly of First Nations national executive for governance and nation building, the Chiefs Committee on Claims (including additions to reserve and specific claims) and chaired the comprehensive claims joint working group. During her first terms as Regional Chief, Wilson-Raybould worked with colleagues, including Senator Gerry St. Germain to introduce Bill S-212, the First Nations Self-Government Recognition Act. This Senate public bill would have provided a mechanism for First Nations to be recognized by the federal government as \\"self-governing\\" following the development of an internal constitution and after a community ratification vote on a self- government proposal. The bill died on the order paper. Wilson-Raybould participated in the 2012 Crown‚ÄìFirst Nations Gathering delivering a strong message on the need to resolve First Nations issues including the need for governance reform and moving beyond the Indian Act to support a strong economy. In the wake of the Idle No More protests and despite criticism from some First Nation leaders, Wilson-Raybould participated in high-level talks with then Prime Minister Stephen Harper. She expressed concern that very little progress had been made nationally on First Nations' issues since the 2012 First Nations‚ÄìCrown Gathering and suggested concrete solutions to these issues. She stated her message very straightforwardly as follows: Societies that govern well simply do better economically, socially and politically than those that do not. Good governance increases societies' chances of meeting the needs of their peoples and developing sustainable long-term economic development, and that First Nations are no different. Wilson-Raybould attributes the lack of progress by the Conservative government during this time as one of her motivations to run for the federal Liberals in the 2015 federal election. Volunteering Wilson-Raybould has served as a director of Capilano University. As a former board member for the Minerva Foundation for BC Women (2008‚Äì2010), Wilson-Raybould was instrumental in the development of the \\"Combining Our Strength Initiative\\" ‚Äì a partnership of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women. In addition to her duties as Director of the Lands Advisory Board and Chair of the First Nations Finance Authority Wilson- Raybould has also been a Director of the Nuyumbalees Cultural Centre since 2013. Wilson-Raybould has spoken publicly on such topics as aboriginal law, treaties, the environment, financial transparency, good governance and reconciliation. Prior to federal politics, she made numerous presentations before parliamentary committees including the Senate Standing Committee on Human Rights, the Senate Standing Committee on Aboriginal Peoples and the House of Commons Standing Committee on Aboriginal Peoples and Northern Development. Wilson-Raybould has travelled extensively to work on indigenous peoples' rights and leadership issues, including to the Philippines, Taiwan and Israel.  Federal politics  Nomination and candidacy Wilson- Raybould was the co-chair of the 2014 Biennial Liberal Convention held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She secured the nomination for Vancouver Granville on July 31, 2014. Wilson-Raybould was seen to be close to Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau who approached her to run for the Liberals during the 2013 AFN Annual General meeting in Whitehorse. Her areas of core policy concern and competence include: democratic reform, balancing the environment and the economy, Aboriginal affairs and affordable housing. Wilson-Raybould visited the Great Bear Rainforest with Justin Trudeau in 2014. Following the announcement of the nomination, Isadore Day, Chief of the Serpent River First Nation (located in Ontario), alleged that Wilson-Raybould was in conflict of interest by continuing to act as Regional Chief while holding the Liberal Party nomination. Wilson-Raybould denied that her decision to run gave rise to a conflict. In response to Chief Day's allegation, the BC Assembly of First Nations adopted a unanimous resolution in support of Wilson-Raybould, and expressed full confidence she would be able to continue to perform her duties as Regional Chief while also serving as a Liberal candidate. Numerous First Nations supporters rallied behind Wilson-Raybould on social media, calling her a figure who could make \\"changes from the inside\\" and harshly criticizing Chief Day for meddling in B.C. affairs. \\"Chief Isadore Day has time to write letters about B.C., while his own community struggles?\\" wrote one member of Serpent River First Nation in a Facebook post. Wilson-Raybould said she would take a leave of absence during the campaign and if a conflict did arise before then, she would resign. Wilson-Raybould stepped down from the position of Regional Chief in June 2015 in accordance with the transition plan approved in September 2014 by consensus of the Chiefs following her nomination. 2015 Election Wilson-Raybould was elected in the October 19, 2015 general election, obtaining 43.9% of the vote.  Minister of Justice and Attorney General (2015‚Äì2019)  Wilson-Raybould began serving as Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of Canada (MOJAG) on November 4, 2015, becoming the first Indigenous person and third woman to hold the office. On November 12, 2015, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave Wilson-Raybould her mandate letter, which asked her to deliver on, among other matters, responding to the Supreme Court of Canada's decision on medical assistance in dying, reviewing the government's litigation strategy, conducting a review of the changes in the criminal justice system and sentencing reforms over the previous decade (including looking to increase the use of restorative justice processes and other initiatives to reduce the rate of incarceration amongst indigenous Canadians), creating the process to legalize and strictly regulate cannabis, restoring a modern Court Challenges Program, introducing government legislation to add gender identity as a prohibited ground for discrimination under Canadian law, and reforming the Supreme Court of Canada nomination process to ensure that it is transparent, inclusive and accountable to Canadians. In December 2016, along with Ralph Goodale, the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, she submitted the National Security Green Paper, \\"Our Security, Our Rights: National Security Green Paper, 2016\\", a consultation paper aimed at informing further public discussion on issues of national security. During the first six months in office, she introduced major legislation on medical assistance in dying‚Äîone of her key mandate letter commitments. In collaboration with her colleague, Health Minister Jane Philpott, Wilson-Raybould led the effort to pass Bill C-14, which received Royal Assent on June 17, 2016. Wilson-Raybould also introduced Bill C-16, which amended the Canadian Human Rights Act to add gender identity and gender expression to the list of prohibited grounds for discrimination, which was another key mandate letter commitment. The legislation also amended the Criminal Code to extend protections against hate propaganda, and it received Royal Assent on June 16, 2017. Meeting with US Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson in Ottawa on October 26, 2016 The Minister's mandate letter called for a review of the Government's litigation strategy to \\"end appeals or positions inconsistent with the Government's commitments, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, or Canadian values\\". As part of that commitment, on January 11, 2019, she issued the Directive on Civil Litigation Involving Indigenous Peoples. The Directive guides the Government of Canada's legal approaches, positions and decisions taken in civil litigation involving Aboriginal and treaty rights, and the Crown's obligation towards Indigenous peoples. In 2017 she published the first-ever Litigation Year in Review with a subsequent edition in 2018. In February 2017, Prime Minister Trudeau named Minister Wilson-Raybould chair of the Working Group of Ministers on the Review of Laws and Policies Related to Indigenous Peoples, a Cabinet working group responsible for reviewing federal laws and policies that impact the rights of Indigenous peoples. Through consultation with Indigenous groups and experts, the Working Group adopted Principles respecting the Government of Canada's relationship with Indigenous peoples to guide their work. Those Principles were released on July 14, 2017, and have been the subject of considerable commentary. The Minister herself authored an op-ed on the subject in The Globe and Mail and devoted a major speech to the Assembly of First Nations Annual General Assembly to the Principles and their importance. As Minister of Justice, Wilson-Raybould introduced Bill C-45, the Cannabis Act on April 13, 2017. After passage by both houses of parliament in June 2018, it enabled the nationwide legalization of cannabis in October the same year. The passage of C-45 makes Canada the second country to legalize the recreational use of cannabis. The new law legalizes, strictly regulates and controls access to cannabis and came into force on October 17, 2018. On April 13, 2017, Wilson- Raybould also introduced Bill C-46, which is the most comprehensive reform to the Criminal Code transportation regime in more than 40 years, including to drug and alcohol-impaired driving. The reforms were said to create a new, modern, simplified, and more coherent system to better deter and detect drug and alcohol-impaired driving. Bill C-46 was notable for bringing forward limits for drug impaired driving, and allowing mandatory roadside alcohol screening. The Bill received Royal Assent in June 2018. As part of her Mandate Letter commitment to \\"undertake modernization efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system\\", Wilson-Raybould introduced Bill C-75, a package of law reforms to deal with delays in the criminal justice system. The bill also included other pieces of legislation which had not advanced past First Reading in the House of Commons. Those included Bills C-28 (Victim Surcharge), C-38 (Human Trafficking), and C-39 (Charter Cleanup). Bill C-75 addresses areas such as bail reform, administration of justice offences, changes to preliminary inquiries, jury selection and reclassification of offences. Bill C-75 included an amendment to end the use peremptory challenges. The introduction of the Bill came shortly after a controversial decision rendered in the Gerald Stanley trial. Gerald Stanley, a non-indigenous farmer, was acquitted in the shooting death of Colton Boushie, a 22-year-old Cree man, in Battleford, Saskatchewan. The decision was rendered by an all-white jury after any potential jurors with Indigenous ancestry were eliminated through peremptory challenges. Wilson- Raybould's tweet in response to the verdict sparked significant controversy with claims of undermining the justice system by questioning the jury's verdict, while others supported her empathy, and commitment to ensuring justice for all Canadians. Wilson-Raybould continued to oversee broad reforms and a review of the criminal justice system in Canada. Wilson-Raybould also introduced Bill C-51, which received Royal Assent and came into force on December 13, 2018. Bill C-51 was the first update to sexual assault laws in over 25 years. It clarifies the law of sexual assault, and addresses concerns about how the law is applied in practice. In addition, it repeals Criminal Code provisions struck down by Canadian courts and codifies certain Supreme Court jurisprudence. Bill C-51 amended the Department of Justice Act to create an obligation for the government to table a Charter Statement for every piece of proposed legislation outlining its impact on the rights protected in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In May 2018, Wilson-Raybould introduced Bill C-78, the first major amendments to Canadian family law in over 20 years. She said bill C-78 aims to promote the best interests of the child and make Canada's family justice system more accessible and efficient, while addressing issues such as child poverty, access to justice and family violence. This legislation complements the judicial resources for Unified Family Courts announced in Budget 2018, which is a commitment in the Mandate Letter of the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. In her role as Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Wilson-Raybould also introduced Bill C-84, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (bestiality and animal fighting) on October 18, 2018. The changes brought forward in this legislation aim to amend Section 160 of the Criminal Code, which adds a definition of bestiality as any contact for sexual purpose between a person and an animal. Bill C-84 also amends Section 445.1(1)(b) and 447 which amend current and existing laws pertaining to animal fighting. The new amendments seek to include the breeding or training of an animal to fight another animal, the building or maintenance of an arena for animal fighting, or the promoting, arranging or receiving money for the fighting of animals as offences under this section of the Criminal Code. In October 2016, Wilson-Raybould oversaw changes to the process for appointing judges across Canada, with the stated goal of ensuring the process \\"is transparent and accountable to Canadians, and promotes greater diversity on the bench\\". For instance, the government introduced changes to the structure and composition of the Judicial Advisory Committees, which are tasked with evaluating candidates who apply to the bench. In addition, the government began collecting and publishing demographic statistics related judicial applicants and appointees. In June 2018, it was reported that the government had been \\"naming women to the bench at an unprecedented rate\\".. As Minister of Justice, Wilson-Raybould assisted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in introducing a new process for appointments to the Supreme Court of Canada. The government has taken the position that justices appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada must be functionally bilingual. The first justice appointed under the new process, Justice Malcolm Rowe from Newfoundland and Labrador, was sworn in on October 31, 2016. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the name of his second appointment to the Supreme Court of Canada, Justice Sheilah Martin from Alberta, on November 29, 2017. In 2018, Wilson-Raybould ordered an internal and external review of the extradition of Hassan Diab to France. The extradition had occurred under one of her predecessors, Rob Nicholson. Diab's lawyer, Donald Bayne, criticized the internal review, saying the justice department lawyer conducting the internal review was in a conflict of interest because he had played a role in the extradition. Murray Segal, former Attorney General of Ontario, was appointed to conduct the external review. He completed his review after Wilson-Raybould had ended her tenure as Attorney General. The review cleared Canadian prosecutors of any wrongdoing, but also made recommendations to improve the extradition process. Bayne called the review a \\"whitewash\\". Wilson-Raybould was also criticized by the lawyer for Glen Assoun, who said she delayed for 18 months in acting on a Justice Department recommendation that he receive a new trial. Her successor, David Lametti, recommended a new trial, which ultimately led to Assoun's release. In addition, the prosecutor, Mark Scott, at Assoun's new trial, referenced what he called the \\"considerable period of time since the minister's decision has been pending.\\" Upon her move to Veterans Affairs, Wilson-Raybould issued a public statement which outlined her milestones as the former Minister of Justice and Attorney General and stated that an Attorney General must be \\"non-partisan, more transparent in the principles that are the basis of decisions, and, in this respect, always willing to speak truth to power\\".  Minister of Veterans Affairs (2019)  On January 14, 2019, Trudeau made a cabinet shuffle, moving Wilson-Raybould from her role as the Minister of Justice & Attorney General to become the Minister of Veterans Affairs. The move was seen as a demotion, and initially believed to be related to Wilson-Raybould's positions on indigenous reconciliation; Don Martin, host of CTV News Channel's Power Play called it a 'hit job' and suggested it could be due to her criticism of the pace of reconciliation under the Trudeau government, while President of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs Grand Chief Stewart Phillip called the decision \\"disappointing and disturbing\\", saying \\"The removal of these critical and well-respected ministers, during a period of significant conflict and tension, demonstrates Trudeau's lack of resolve to address Canada's deplorable relationship with Indigenous peoples.\\" In a written statement, Wilson-Raybould said she would not talk about the shuffle, but did talk about her work as Justice Minister, about the unique responsibilities of the dual Minister of Justice/Attorney General role in Canadian government, and about the importance of avoiding the appearance of political interference. She resigned from the Trudeau cabinet on February 12, 2019.  SNC-Lavalin affair  On February 8, 2019, The Globe and Mail reported that sources close to the government said that the Prime Minister's Office allegedly had attempted to influence Wilson- Raybould concerning an ongoing prosecution of SNC-Lavalin while she was Minister of Justice and Attorney General. When asked about the allegations, Justin Trudeau said that the story in the Globe was false and that he had never \\"directed\\" Wilson-Raybould concerning the case. Wilson-Raybould did not comment on the matter, citing solicitor-client privilege. She resigned from the Trudeau cabinet on February 12. Trudeau said he did not anticipate her resignation and expressed disappointment over her decision, as it was not reflective of the conversations they had had during their recent meetings. Following Wilson-Raybould's resignation, Trudeau expressed his opinion that his government abided by all rules, did its job properly, and that if anyone within the government ‚Äì including the former attorney-general ‚Äì felt otherwise, the responsibility lay with Wilson-Raybould to address these concerns directly to him or the Ethics Commissioner. She retained Thomas Albert Cromwell as counsel in order to determine the scope of information she was allowed to share with the public. Support came from across Canada on social media, with #StandWithJody making 463,000 impressions between the February 14 and 24, while her popular credibility on this issue had reached 73%, according to a February 14 Public Square Research poll. On February 20, Wilson-Raybould addressed the House of Commons with the hope to \\"have the opportunity to speak my truth\\". On February 27, Jody Wilson-Raybould gave extended testimony to the House of Commons justice committee on this matter. On March 25, CTV News reported that relations between Wilson-Raybould and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau first began to fray in 2017, when Trudeau disagreed with a recommendation by Wilson-Raybould to appoint the conservative Manitoba judge Glenn Joyal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The report was based on earlier reporting by The Canadian Press which relied on \\"well-placed\\" anonymous sources. Wilson-Raybould denied to CTV News that there was any conflict over the Supreme Court recommendation. The report suggests the Prime Minister could have had reasons unrelated to the SNC-Lavalin affair for moving Wilson-Raybould out of the Justice portfolio. In his column in the National Post, Andrew Coyne questioned this conclusion, pointing out that Trudeau had originally claimed Wilson-Raybould would \\"still be [Attorney-General] today\\" had Scott Brison not resigned and necessitated a cabinet shuffle. Conservative MP Peter Kent called the leak a \\"disgusting act of desperation\\" and said it could only have come from someone who had or was currently working in the Prime Minister's Office. Paul Wells of Maclean's also accused the Trudeau government of being the source of the leak. He further suggested the leak was an attempt to damage Wilson-Raybould and as an excuse to remove her from the Liberal caucus in the future. Following publication of details of the judicial appointment process, Wilson-Raybould condemned the leaks and called for an independent investigation. Trudeau initially refused to deny his office was involved in the leaks. The following day, he said his office did not play \\"any part in leaking\\". On March 29, a telephone call, secretly recorded by Wilson- Raybould, between herself and Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, was released wherein Wernick told Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau wanted a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin \\"one way or another\\".SNC-Lavalin: Committee releases texts, secret recording of Wernick from Jody Wilson- Raybould The call accompanied a submission of forty pages supplementing her original testimony, including copies of texts and emails, outlining Wilson- Raybould's view of events. On April 2, 2019, Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould from the Liberal Caucus in the House of Commons and stripped her of the Liberal party nomination for the 2019 Canadian federal election, referring to her secretly recording her conversation with the Privy Council Clerk as being \\"unconscionable\\". Opposition party leaders condemned the move, with Conservative leader Andrew Scheer saying, \\"if you tell the truth, there is no room for you in the Liberal Party\\". NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said that Wilson- Raybould tried to \\"put integrity and what's right for Canadians over what helps the Liberals\\" and that she \\"deserved better\\", and Green Party leader Elizabeth May said Wilson-Raybould had shown honour and integrity in her work, and that \\"the laws weren't broken because she held firm\\". Ethics Commissioner's report On August 14, 2019, Mario Dion, the Parliament of Canada's Ethics Commissioner, released a report that said Trudeau contravened section 9 of the Conflict of Interest Act by improperly pressuring Wilson- Raybould. The report details lobbying efforts by SNC-Lavalin to influence prosecution since at least February 2016, including the lobbying efforts to enact DPA legislation. The report analyses SNC-Lavalin's interests and finds that the lobbying effort advanced private interests of the company, rather than public interests. The report's analysis section discusses the topics of prosecutorial independence and Shawcross doctrine (dual role of Attorney General) to draw the conclusion that the influence was improper and a violation of Conflict of Interest Act. Responding to the report, Trudeau said he accepted it and took responsibility but disagreed with its findings. Andrew Scheer renewed his calls for a RCMP investigation, while Elizabeth May and Jagmeet Singh reiterated their calls for an inquiry. A RCMP spokesperson declined to confirm or deny whether an investigation is underway, saying that the police force is carefully reviewing the facts and will take \\"appropriate actions as required\\". After the report was made public, Wilson-Raybould released a statement saying it is a vindication of her positions on prosecutorial independence and the role of Attorney General. She stated that the report confirms that she acted appropriately at all times and that the staff of the Prime Minister's office acted improperly.  2019 election  Prior to her removal from caucus, Wilson-Raybould had said she would run as the Liberal candidate for Vancouver Granville in the 2019 federal election. When she was removed from the caucus, she was also stripped of the Liberal Party nomination. On May 27, Wilson-Raybould announced that she would run for reelection as an independent candidate. On July 24, 2019, it was announced that Wilson-Raybould would be releasing a book about how to move forward with reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. The book was released by UBC Press on September 20. On October 21, 2019, Wilson-Raybould defeated Liberal candidate Taleeb Noormohamed by 3,177 votes. After the election, Wilson-Raybould refused to move out of the entire office space assigned to her in 2018 when she was a cabinet minister, a series of six offices equipped with a private bathroom classified as a ministerial suite. House of Commons Speaker Anthony Rota said he would have to enforce the rules so that Parliament can function. Parliamentary offices are re-assigned after election overseen by the Speaker's office. Priority is given on the basis of seat count ‚Äî that means the Liberals get first pick, followed by the Conservatives. Wilson-Raybould said she was willing to give up one of the spaces to keep the other. Awards and recognition In 2011, Wilson-Raybould was awarded a Minerva Foundation for BC Women award. In 2012, she received the distinguished alumni award from the University of Victoria. She has also been included in Vancouver Magazine's \\"Power 50\\" (2012 and 2014). In 2015, Wilson-Raybould was selected by the Canadian Board Diversity Council as a Diversity 50 candidate, a list of Canada's most diverse board ready candidates. On April 6, 2017, Wilson- Raybould received the inaugural Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business, Indigenous Women in Leadership Award. The 2018 award winner was Roberta L. Jamieson, the first First Nation woman in Canada to earn a law degree, and the President and CEO of Indspire. Wilson-Raybould was featured in Paulina Cameron's 2017 book Canada 150 Women: Conversations with Leaders, Champions, and Luminaries which profiles the achievements and struggles of ground- breaking female role models. In 2017, Wilson-Raybould was named Policy-Maker of the Year by the Macdonald-Laurier Institute. She was featured in their December 2017 edition of their magazine 'Inside Policy'. In 2018, Wilson- Raybould was recognized by Harvard Women's Law Association as one of their 2018 International Women's Day Honourees and provided a keynote address at their annual event. MADD Canada honoured Wilson-Raybould as the recipient of a 2018 Citizen of Distinction award for her outstanding efforts to strengthen Canada's impaired driving laws, and in particular her contributions to bringing forward Bill C-46. The Citizen of Distinction Award is presented annually to individuals, groups or organizations that have made a major provincial/territorial or national contribution to the anti-impaired driving movement in Canada, leaving a lasting legacy in the areas of research, prevention and education, legal issues or victim issues. On March 7, 2018, Wilson-Raybould, alongside Judge Silvia Fern√°ndez de Gurmendi, President of the International Criminal Court (ICC), unveiled an Inuit inukshuk which had been donated to the ICC by the Government of Canada to mark Canada's support for the ICC. The unveiling took place at the ICC's premises in The Hague.

Displaced by the Vietnam War, many settled in the United States from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s. From China, the Iu Mien migrated to Vietnam, Laos and Thailand. They speak the Iu Mien language. History The Iu Mien people were the first civilization in China according to the chanting song story, Iu Mien Elders, a shaman's worship book written by Iu Mien elders in ancient Chinese characters. The Iu Mien nation was located in the southern part of China today known as Guangdong, Guangxi and Hunan provinces and was ruled by the king of the Iu Mien people. The last Iu Mien King was King Pan, the namesake of the modern Iu Mien surnames: Phan, Saephanh, Saephan, Phanh, Pharn, Pan, Pham, etc. King Pan and the Chinese emperor declared war against each other 800 years ago over disputed territory. Iu Mien, led by King Pan, were fighting to protect their people and their territory. King Pan and Iu Mien suffered tremendous losses. King Pan lost countless soldiers and civilian casualties as well as territory to the Chinese emperor. The Chinese emperor captured most of the Iu Mien's territory. Iu Mien and King Pan were unable to fight due to outnumbered soldiers and weapons, which forced King Pan to negotiate with the Chinese emperor. The Chinese emperor gave two options to King Pan and Iu Mien people: 1) Surrender to the Chinese emperor and sign a treaty to give all territorial land to the Chinese emperor, or 2) King Pan could continue to fight, but the Chinese would wipe out Iu Mien society in a short period. King Pan and his government chose to give up all territories to China and signed the treaty called ‚ÄúPassport to travel in the hill‚Äù or ‚ÄúPassport to cross the mountain.‚Äù This document contained relevant information. The Chinese emperor had written this document in Chinese character. > ‚ÄúIu Mien people have rights to maintain their identity, language, culture, > and worship system and live on the hill side or in the mountain to cultivate > land for farming and crops and raise their family. The Iu Mien would not be > allowed to form their own government and have no rights to pursue their own > nation. Iu Mien, who possesses this document, has the legal rights to cross > any territories/ borders to settle and to build their village in the > hill/mountain to make a living by farming without delaying by any regional > governments. The governments of that country are responsible for their > wellbeing and educating them to follow the rules of laws of the country that > Iu Mien are living in.‚Äù After the loss of their nation, the 12 existing clans of Iu Mien people had to separate into small villages due to the mountainous area and foot hill land. Each village consisted of 15 to 20 families. The majority of people in each village were related. In some cases, they kept their clan together. Their farming life style was slash-and-burn to clear the grass and trees and to fertilize crops. Hunting and fishing were their primary career for men to provide foods for their families. They hunt many different kinds of wild animals ranging from birds, squirrels, monkeys, deer, wild buffalo, to elephants. Iu Mien women's primary role is to take care of household chores and feed animals. Iu Mien's written language is similar to Chinese character which is for religious and chant only songs. No written language for daily speaking. Every five to ten years, the mountain where the Iu Mien people lived and farmed would no longer be able to grow crops because the slash and burn process destroys proper elements soils needed to grow crops in the region. They had to move to a new place and location in the deep tropical forest to start a new life and a new village all over again. Iu Mien people were scattered all over the mountains in China. The mountains where they lived became deserts because of the slash and burn farming. They looked for new places such as other mountainous areas to build new villages. They had to search further south and eventually moved into Vietnam.  Migration from China to Vietnam  No known record indicates what year the Iu Mien had entered Vietnam because of the constant fear of persecution by the Chinese emperor. The method of slash and burn used throughout mountainous regions in China led to a drought which caused the Iu Mien people to migrate to Vietnam. They saw Vietnam as an opportunity to build new villages and cultivate forest for farming. The Iu Mien population gradually migrated into Vietnam, in the province called ‚ÄúMoung Lai.‚Äù The lands had rich natural soil. The Iu Mien people were able to produce enough food to support their families. However, the local people persecuted the Iu Mien. When one of the local people died, they brought the dead body to an Iu Mien village and put in front of Iu Mien hut house door late at night. At dawn the next morning, the Iu Mien found a dead body in front of their door step. They reported this to the local authorities. The local authorities and local people accused the Iu Mien people of murdering the victim. They charged Iu Mien people with all of the wealth they had. In some cases, they charged the Iu Mien capital punishment by hanging to death for a crime that they did not commit. The local government imposed a high tax on Iu Mien families. Each year when a family couldn't afford to pay tax, the local government would force the Iu Mien people to sell a child to pay the tax due. The Iu Mien families were deteriorated by the government's action and no longer be able to continue to live in Vietnam. They were searching for a new place again. During 1600s and 1800s, the Iu Mien people found Laos and Thailand. They gradually migrated to Laos and Thailand.  Life in Laos and Thailand  Since Iu Mien people had settled into Laos and Thailand, they gained more independence. One group of Iu Mien migrated from Vietnam to Thailand. The other migrated from Vietnam to Laos. They were able to form their own villages and run by village chiefs. Laos and Thai governments were helping Iu Mien to select their village chiefs to run their village affairs and report to city mayor and governor of their village social issues and problems. Iu Mien people were allowed to maintain their culture, identity, language, cultural norms, and ways of Iu Mien's living. Rich Iu Mien families would be able to own a house in the city and send their kids to school. The poor would be able to find the land to cultivate for farming without government restrictions. The natural soils of the land were rich. They were free to farm anywhere within the countryside. The Iu Mien people were able to plant crops and be self-sufficient for many generations. The tropical forests in Laos and Thailand have all kinds of wild animals for Iu Mien to hunt for consumption as well as various kinds of tropical fruits and wild vegetables which provide nutrients to Iu Mien people. The rivers have plenty of fishes for Iu Mien to fish for food. They were enjoying life and the environment in Laos and Thailand for many generations until 1960, when the cold war began.  Iu Mien in the war in Laos  In 1960s, when the Cold War was occurring between the United States and the Soviet Union with an arms race this caused political unrest in Southeast Asia. The United States spread the free world government system into Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. At the same time, the Soviet Union had spread the communist system into Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia as well. The people within those three countries also divided and ran by two government systems. Civil war broke out. Vietnam divided into two countries, North Vietnam and South Vietnam; North Vietnam was ran by a communist regime led by Ho Chi Minh. South Vietnam was led by the elected Vietnamese President and supported by the United States' government. The Vietnam War began. At the same time, Laos and Cambodia also had two government systems, one supported by United States and the other supported by Soviet Union Socialist Republic. The civil war began as Vietnam War. The cold war in South East Asia has interrupted the lives of Iu Mien society and changed them forever. The United States government sent Central Intelligent Agency (CIA) and military advisors into Laos in support of the Royal Lao government to fight against communists Pathet Lao. They recruited Iu Mien people as their soldiers to fight against the Lao Communists regime. The war had caused many Iu Mien casualties along with other tribes. Iu Mien soldiers were armed with American made weapons and dressed in American military uniforms and also funded by American taxpayer dollars. Over a 15-year period, more American bombs were dropped by American planes over Laos than World War I and World War II combined. Lao citizens became refugees all over Laos. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided aid to the refugees. By 1975, the Pathet Lao communists had gained complete control over Laos. They captured the Royal Lao high ranking government officials and sent them to a concentration camp. The majority of them starved to death. The others were sentenced to death by firing squad and others suffered from illness due to malnutrition and also died in the concentration camp. The majority of former elected government officials, ministries, governors, mayors, government workers, and all educators were sent to concentration camp for re-education. In most cases, the Lao communist soldiers, armed with Soviet made or Chinese made AK-47s, forced them to work from dawn to dark without food and many starved to death. The majority of Iu Mien was among the Lao communists enemy due to the involvement with the U.S. CIA operation during the war in Laos. Iu Mien began fleeing the Laos communist regime in mid-1975 into Thailand. These escapes mostly began late at night. While Laos communist troops were sleeping whole villages would packed their personal belongings, valuable items, silver bars, jewelry, and food. Everyone had to carry their personal belongings on their backs and walk bare foot. The journey began by walking on a terrain trail and it took about a month to reach the Thai border. During journey, Iu Mien refugees had encounters with many dangerous consequences. Some stepped on land mines set up by the Laos communist troops and lost their lives without proper burial by their love ones. They encountered bandits armed with semi- automatic weapons, who took all valuable items from the refugee families. Furthermore, Iu Mien lost many lives by crossing monsoon flooded river. Many family members drowned while crossing the rising river during monsoon season. When the Iu Mien refugees whom made it to the Thai border, they faced Laos communist persecution. However, the Thai border patrol troops stopped them at the Thai and Lao border. From time to time, Thai defense Minister closed the border and did not allow refugees to enter Thailand within a certain time. The refugee camps were funded and set up by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and enforced by Thai authorities. The refugee camps were barbed with metal wire and guarded by Thai soldiers 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. No refugees were allowed to go out of the refugee camp. The living conditions were very poor. There was no running water. There was no clean water to drink or for a shower. Personal hygiene was poor and caused illness. The food was distributed from UNHCR program but had to go through the Thai authorities before it reached the needy refugees. By that time, the food got to refugee families were so limited. All refugees were starving and cause malnutrition as well as all kind of illness and lost many lives during their stay in the refugee camp. In 1976, the western governments sent their embassy personnel to interview Lao refugees and process legal documents to allow them to settle in western countries. From 1976 to 1995, 40,000 thousand plus Iu Mien refugees were settled in the United States of America. The majority of Iu Mien people in the U.S. today live in California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and North Carolina. Few lives scatter all over the United States due to follow jobs, pursue education, and marriage which has to move to close to family members. The Iu Mien people today are spreading out to the western hemisphere. About 1,500 plus were settled in France. About 400 Iu Mien people were settled in Canada. Few families were settled in Australia and New Zealand. A couple families had settled in Demark. Each time the Iu Mien migrated into new country, they have to leave many fellow Iu Mien people behind. The majority of Iu Mien people still remain in China. At least 2 to 3 million Iu Mien are living in China. 500,000 thousand plus Iu Mien are living in Vietnam. About 50,000 thousand plus Iu Mien people are living in Thailand and about 30,000 thousand plus are still remaining in Laos  Culture   Marriage  The Iu Mien have a strong family foundation. Marriage norms are strongly preserved in Iu Mien society. When a man feels that his girlfriend is a potential wife, he will ask his parents to set up a meeting with the girl's parents. When the girl's parents accepted and confirmed that they're welcome by the boy's parents to meet with them, usually the girl's parents would prepare a meal and welcome the boy's parents to join together. Boy's parent will ask girl's birth date to match each other. If their birth dates are matching, further discussion will take place. The next step is to give a silver bracelet to the girl. This symbolizes primary engagement. The girl's responsibility is to decide whether she is loved her boyfriend and committed herself to spending the rest of her life with him. She will keep the silver bracelet, if she feels he is the right man. However, she will make an attempt to return a silver bracelet to her boyfriend at least once to test him. This is a chance for her to test how much commitment her boyfriend has to spend the rest of his life with her. The boyfriend has to bring the silver bracelet back to his girlfriend and ask her to keep it. Normally, she will keep it. The boy will then ask his parents to set up a second appointment to negotiate dowry of the girl and what kind of wedding the girl's parent would like to propose. There are two types of Iu Mien wedding, the small wedding and big wedding ceremony. The big wedding cost 15,000 to 30,000 dollars excluded dowry. The small wedding cost about 5,000 to 15,000 thousand dollars. During the wedding day, the parents of both of the people getting married will select one important master ceremony. These two important figures are their guidance, mentors, and lecture to explain about their journey as a husband and a wife's role. These two master wedding ceremonies are well respected in the Iu Mien Community with an expert in Iu Mien religion like master shaman and also know well how to solve Iu Mien social problem. For husband side's master is called cingh suiv (in Iu Mien language) to perform religion ceremony to chant and report to ancestor god that young wife has joined a family member and add into the family. Now the ancestor god has to protect her from harm and bless newly couple with kids and wealth during their marriage and for the rest of their live as husband and wife last for a life time commitment. For the girl's side of master is called, muih mienh (in Iu Mien language) also performs the ceremony the night before escort the bride into the groom's house. The master ceremony is to chant and thanks the ancestor spirit god to care her from birth up to today as a young woman who is now ready to have her own family. Her name removed from her ancestor god and will be added to her husband's side of ancestor god. Iu Mien family structure is based on kin-ship system when a women gets married she will move to live with her husband's side of the family. A wife's primary responsibility is to do household chores. A husband is responsible for financial support and food to the family. Both husband and wife have a mutual responsibility to take care of their children and do any other household chores. Religion After losing his nation to China, King Pan had created a new worship system by worshiping ancestor spirit and a universal god. Due to no permanent place to build temples, King Pan and the shaman/priest had formed art-posters consisting of the universal gods including three brothers of Celestials and many universal spirit gods. These poster images can be easily carried when they moved from mountain to mountain without interrupting worshiping. All shaman spiritual books start with King Pan as a founder of the religion and creator. The most important aspect of Iu Mien ancestor worship is when a person died. When a family member who has died, they will host a ceremony. Iu Mien people believe a deceased person has two types of spirit/soul. The good and bad spirits that need to be properly send to certain place. The Iu Mien priest/shaman will perform a ceremony to guide the deceased soul/spirit to the spirit world. The good spirit will be worship by his/her children and it can help protect family from harm and bless family in many means. The bad spirit will be sent to hell and locked away so it will not be able to come back to haunt family members. The priests/shamans perform a ceremony of chanting 2‚Äì3 days in order to wrap up and complete the deceased spirit and soul and guide each spirit/soul to the right destination of the spirit world so that evil spirit doesn't comes back to haunt family members. The deceased's good spirit/soul becomes heavenly being and looks after his/her surviving family members on a daily basis. From time to time, family members will offer a chicken and joss paper money to the deceased's good spirit to ask for guiding and protection from harm. In other times, family members dream or have nightmares about the deceased family member. That means the deceased spirit/soul needs help by their living family member so the ancestor god will send a message by dreaming. In the other occasion, ancestor gods will send strange things such as making bird fly into Iu Mien house. If this signal is received by family member, the ceremony will take place. By offering chicken and joss paper, the spirit world will gain wealth. In return, god spirit will help human world to gain all kinds of well-being. Such as a family's business will gain profit, working person will get paid raised, students have creative ideas to concentrate on study, a person feel sad without a reason will gain strength and confident. Ill person will gain energy and get heal/well. Each deceased person get three times ceremony during his/her children's life time, the spirit/soul become heaven god and has more power to take good care of his/her children and grandchildren. When Iu Mien priests/shaman chanting, they start to tell a story of how King Pan created society, the priest/shaman laminated from the King Pan and called King Pan's spirit/soul to bless so that the priest has more power to perform the ceremony well. King Pan was a head of religion and the head of state when he was a King. Even today, Iu Mien people still believe his spirit/soul has power to deal with spirit world and human world for many good reasons. (Religion story telling by Saeng Fou Orn Saephanh, grand priest/Shaman). Festivals There are two main holidays that the Iu Mien celebrate, New Year's Day and July 14. New Year's Day for the Iu Mien is the same day as the Chinese Lunar New Year. There is a ritual on the eve of the New Year, in which an Iu Mien family will prepare an offering to their ancestor god such as a shaman chanting and offering incense, pig, paper, and firewood for the ritual. After the offering by a shaman is over, a pig will be cooked and made into a variety of dishes, and family members, cousins, relatives, and friends will be invited to have a feast together. Eggs dyed red is used for Iu Mien New Year's Day. Eggs at New Year symbolize blessing to an individual's soul or spirit. The other holiday is July 14, celebrate spirit day. The Iu Mien people believe that on the 14th, it is a day for the entire universe of spirits-gods New Year's Day. In the old days, villagers did not go to work in the fields or farms or do anything related to work outside the house. In every household, the people give credits to the spirit and let them free, the household will offer incense paper to the ancestor spirits for them to buy things in the spirit world. On July 15, the ancestor spirits are traditionally believed to be in every leaf in every tree. People are traditionally forbidden to touch or explore all tree leaves. It is believed that if a person touches a leaf or cuts down a tree this will bother spirits which will cause the individual who did so to become ill. On July 16 it is believed that the whole universe's spirits return to the spirit world so everything in the human world is believed to become normal again. Iu Mien in the United States today Today, there are about 30,000 to 50,000 Iu Mien people living in the United States; they adapted well in the industrial country which they learned to obtain job skills and work in the production workforce as well as white collar jobs in the United States of America. Since Iu Mien people have arrived in the United States, they have had the opportunity to go to school and continue their higher education and be accepted into colleges and universities. Some Iu Mien students are accepted into prestigious colleges such as Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Columbia and others. There are more and more Iu Mien who have graduated with doctorates and law degrees and joined the professional workforce and contributed their services to the society. Many have graduated with master's degrees and undergraduate degrees who have joined the workforce in many fields such as the private sector, public sectors and small business entrepreneurs. Furthermore, in 2012, the first Iu Mien was elected into the public office as city council in San Pablo, California. Overall, Iu Mien people have made progress and catching up with the majority in the mainstream society and assimilated into American dominant culture well. However, there are many social issues and problems facing the Iu Mien communities in the United States as well. Many Iu Mien people are still poor and living under poverty level. Challenges faced by the Iu Mien in the United States today There are many social problems facing the Iu Mien American community throughout the United States today. The first generation {first wave of arrival to America} of Iu Mien American suffered the most because of culture shock and language barrier. America is not their preference place to live because they do not know and understand the culture, language, and modern society system. The other factor that first generation Iu Mien American in the U.S is facing is education and job skill. A large proportion of the first generation of Iu Mien Americans are unemployed and depend on government social service programs to survive. Therefore, the government funding to social service programs is vital to provide benefit to them in order to sustain their family together. The English class and basic job training to the first generation of Iu Mien American is essential for them to gain proficiency in English and job skill to join workforce to build for self-sufficiency. Because of the US, CIA operation in Laos and at the end of the war, Iu Mien along with the U.S. CIA had lost the war and forces them to abandon their village, properties, and land behind in Laos. Suddenly, they came to America with nothing. Now, they have to learn everything all over again. Culture shock is the hardest for the first generation of Iu Mien American to adapt in America. Parents and kids are often confrontational with each other with minor social problem can potentially escalate the matter into major battle field within the family. Kids have a chance go to school and learn to be American and adapted quickly. Kids want to listen to pop music and dress in modern style as well as exercise their freedom of expression toward parents. Parent see that their kids are not respecting them and see their kids associated with deviant behavior and often cause major arguing within the family. The cause has enormous impact on the first generation of Iu Mien American and leads to emotional stress, loneliness, and mental illness. Iu Mien Community needs financial resources from the government to address mental health problem tremendously. The other social problem that first generation of Iu Mien American face is illegal drug used. When they're confrontation with social problem such as spousal conflict, parents and children conflict, they do not know how to cope with the stress. By using illegal drug to relieve their stress and emotion are primary factor to illegal drug addiction. The other factor contributed to drug addiction was that they believe illegal drug such as opium can cure chronic illness so instead of going to see doctor, they use illegal drug to slow down the chronic pain. They often do not trust modern medical doctors. As consequences, some of the first Iu Mien American addicted to illegal drug. The third major social problem is alcoholic and gambling because lack of social activities for them to participate, and isolation is the main cause to first Iu Mien American become alcoholic and gamblers. Iu Mien Communities are lack of financial resources and programs to address the social problem within Iu Mien Communities. Therefore, the government programs allocate funding to Iu Mien Community is essential and vital for their basic survival. Due to rapid cultural adaptation, the second generation of Iu Mien Americans are less impoverished and societally disadvantaged than their parents. Using the financial foundations created by their parents, most second generation Iu Mien Americans are capable of further educating themselves, and ranking higher in the workplace compared to their predecessors. Most second generation Iu Mien Americans don‚Äôt have children yet, as this generation is still nearing their reproductive years.

The still easily visible burgstall lies in the parish of Kluftern in the borough of Friedrichshafen in the county of Bodenseekreis in the German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg.  History  The castle was built in the 12th century by the lords of Raderach and first mentioned in 1160, when Werner of Raderach witnessed the transfer of serfs to St. Blaise Abbey,Alois Schneider: Burgen und Befestigungen im Bodenseekreis, p. 555 and was abandoned around 1250.Burg Altraderbach at alleburgen.de  Description  The burgstall with its ditches and western rampart The main area of the castle measures about 20 by 21 metres and is surrounded today by an easily recognisable, circular ditch, whose outer boundary is marked by an outer rampart or embankment (Wallrippe). On the steep eastern hillside, the circular ditch transitions directly into the slope; on the other sides, the remnants of an outer bank can still be made out. The flat northern side of the site is guarded by a high embankment and a roughly 2.5 metre deep ditch, which is interrupted at the northwestern corner of the site. Clearly there was a (probably more recent) entrance between this corner and the western section of embankment. On the western side the embankment is markedly lower, but still easy to make out, on the south side it has slipped to form a terrace with a slight eminence. Local accounts locate the story of Christoph von Schmid's Rosa von Tannenburg (the Old Castle representing the Tannenburg) and the demolished New Castle (Fichtenburg) in Raderach. As a result there is a road called the Fichtenburgstra√üe in Raderach and a Tannenburgstra√üe in nearby Unterraderach.

He started swimming in 1983 at the age of 6 years old at Sporting Clube de Portugal. In 1987 he left Sporting Clube de Portugal and moved to the club where he remained until the end of his swimming career: Sport Alg√©s e Dafundo. He made the regular route through the sport's young age groups, participating in all its most important national competitions, achieving along the way important marks and places that enabled him to have his first participation in international competitions of the respective age groups, namely the Multinations. It was however in 1993 that he emerged at the highest level by winning a place on the national team that represented Portugal in Latin Cup held in Florence, as a result of his performance in the National Championships, held in Alg√©s in March, in the pool of Sport Alg√©s e Dafundo. He achieved in this short course competition the marks of 16:12,58 minutes in the 1500 metres freestyle, and 8:32,97 minutes in the 800 metres freestyle (on the way to the 1500 metres, the 800 metres at the time was still exclusively a women‚Äôs event). These marks would give him G1 age group national title (16 years old) and the 2nd place in all age groups, both marks would become later G1 national records, when the redefinition of the age groups occurred by the Portuguese Swimming Federation. In that same season, in the Clube Futebol os Belenenses Olympic sized swimming pool, he would become for the first time national champion in all age groups in the 1500 metres freestyle, with the mark of 16:29,17 minutes. This mark along with the 08:43,32 minutes at the 800 metres freestyle (again on the way to the 1500 metres) would become records later, as well as national records of the G1 age group. In 1994 in the winter Portuguese National Championships (short course), in Braga, he would break the 400 metres freestyle Junior national record with a time of 4:04,14 minutes. In that same year, he would also become the national club record holder of the 4x200 metres freestyle in long course with the mark of 7:49,00 (in Restelo). It was a record that he would break later in 1996 with 7:44,93 (in Famalic√£o), and again in 1998 with 7:40,81 (in Lisboa), this last one lasted for many years before another team was able to break it. In 1999 with the Portuguese National Team in the international Latin Cup competition, he would also break the record at this event (there are two different records in relays, the marks done by a sports club team and by the National Team). He was as well the short course national club record holder in this event in 1996 with 7:30,78 (in Felgueiras). In 1999 he broke the national club record in the 4x100 metres freestyle with 3:29,35 (in Lisboa). Team wise he was the winner, with his club Sport Alg√©s e Dafundo, of the Portuguese National Championships in 1992 (in Aveiro) and 1993 (in Restelo), in the old score system. Already in the current system, he was the winner of 6 Portuguese National Championships in 7 years: 1995/Olivais, 1996/Restelo, 1997/Restelo, 1998/EUL, 2000/Jamor e 2001/P√≥voa Varzim. His contribution for the team and titles was crucial since he was one of the top Portuguese long distance freestyle swimmers. Internationally he took part, in 1994, in what at the time was maybe the most important and emblematic junior competition in the world, at least certainly for a European swimmer: the European Junior Swimming Championships. He swam the 200 metres freestyle (37th place with 2:00.60), the 400 metres freestyle (15th place in the morning heats with 4:07.02, and 7th in the Final B with 4:10,91), the 400 metres medley (16th in the heats with 4:46.07, and 4th in the Final B with 4:41.73), and anchored the 4x200 metres freestyle relay (14th with 8:08.88). He also took part in several other international competitions, like the Multinations, 1993 Latin Cup (Florence), 1998 Latin Cup (Lisbon), 1999 Latin Cup (Guadeloupe), the 1997 (Sicily) and the 1999 (Palma de Maiorca) World University Championships. He had the following best personal times: in the 200 metres freestyle: 1:53.29/1:54.71 (short course/long course); in the 400 metres freestyle: 3:59.11/4:04.45, in the 800 metres freestyle: 8:24.38/8:37.23, in the 1500 metres freestyle: 15:53.12/16:12.66 and in the 400 metres medley: 4:24.85/4:35.43. All these times were achieved between 1996 and 1999, well before the high-tech fabric swimsuits era that revolutionized swimming years after. In his trophy gallery, one can also find Cristina Chaves award in 1997. This is the highest swimming award given by Sport Alg√©s e Dafundo, as recognition of the contribution given to the club. One of the less known and most curious episodes of his sports career was when he participated in a swimming event in the United States of America. The event called Turning of the Tides, a beneficence event to MS that was held in September 2001, just a few weeks after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. An Open Water competition that consisted in a 35 kilometres swimming relay, with one-hour legs, between Santa Catalina Island and Santa Monica shore. Nuno Dias was on the second leg of the Portuguese relay, still in the early stages of the distance, when suddenly an intense fog come across the area and as a result the support boat lost sight of him and the canoeist that was beside him, and the same thing ended up happening also with other countries' relays. With panic established within the event organization, the National Guard was called to help find the missing athletes in the Pacific Ocean‚Ä¶ Nuno Dias and the canoeist were later found and safely collected by the American support boat. After retiring from competitive swimming, he still had some participation in triathlons and open water competitions. He won the river Tejo crossing competition in one of the first editions of the event recent era. He also completed the Seville marathon, already in 2012, under the three-hour mark with the time of 2h57m. He was member of Sport Alg√©s e Dafundo directive structure in 2004, and around that time started also to teach and coach the younger swimming group ages at the club. He would start working for the Portuguese Swimming Federation one year later in 2005, where among other jobs he was responsible for the master‚Äôs national program and later became the Open Water National Coach, responsibility that took him to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, where he coached two Portuguese swimmers during the event: Arseniy Lavrentyev e Daniela In√°cio. Known as the speaker of many Portuguese swimming and triathlon competitions, as well as some athletics ones, he was also the speaker of some international triathlons and open water events, like the Eilat European Triathlon competition in April 2012, and the World Championships Triathlon Series Madrid in 2012 and 2013. The collaboration he had in these and other events with the Portuguese Triathlon Federation ended up in the invitation for him to take the job as the Federation General Manager in March 2014, which he accepted. He was also for several years the swimming commentator and analyst of SportTv, a TV Portuguese sport channel. His second to none determination, strong mind and single minded focus, that kindly gave him the nickname of ‚Äúanimal‚Äù by his colleagues and adversaries, produced during his career swimming efforts and performances that remained in the memory of those who witnessed them. He died on October 7, 2014 in Carnaxide. The Portuguese Swimming and Triathlon Federations organized together a 1500 metres Open Water event in his honour. At the Sport Alg√©s e Dafundo pool was organized a meeting of several friends and his swimming contemporaries, that in his honour swam for 15 minutes and 53 seconds in relay fashion, his best mark at the 1500 metres freestyle; among them were the Portuguese Olympic swimmers Ricardo Pedroso, Miguel Arrobas, Nuno Laurentino, and Ant√≥nio Bessone Bastos. The European Triathlon Union, the Spanish Triathlon Federation, the Portuguese Swimming Federation, the Lisbon Swimming Association, the Portuguese Triathlon Federation, and Sport Alg√©s e Dafundo, released on their official sites notes of their grief in the news of his death.

In 2010, Mikron obtained a license for a 90 nm process, with production starting around 2012‚Äì2013. The 90 nm production facilities and the design center were co- financed almost up to 50% by Rusnano, with a total cost of 16,57 billion Russian rubles. In 2014, due to the suspension of activities between Visa, MasterCard and certain Russian banks, Mikron hoped to receive orders related to the creation of the Russian national card payment system to be launched in 2015. In late 2014 it was announced that Mikron had started pilot production of a domestic microprocessor called Elbrus-2SM using a 90 nm process under the import substitution program in Russia. Domestic production of the Elbrus-2SM microprocessor was selected by the readers of the technical magazine CNews as the most significant event of 2014, while the creation of a national card payment system ranked at number 3 on the list.

He specialized in landscapes and cityscapes with figures.  Life  Mountains (1835) His father was a mill operator. Originally, he was apprenticed to be a carpenter but, while at a private boarding school, began to show some talent for drawing. Unfortunately, due to a childhood accident aggravated by a later illness, he was almost blind in one eye. This had little effect on his artistic ability, apparently, because in 1810, on the recommendation of a local nobleman, he became a journeyman painter in Tartu. However, that didn't turn out well, as he did more manual labor than learning. The following year, he began work in the graphics studio of Karl August Senff, who taught painting and engraving at the University of Dorpat.Brief biography from the University of Tartu Library. In 1820, on the advice of Senff, he decided to go to Germany to sharpen his skills. Sailing to L√ºbeck, he travelled on foot to Berlin, Dresden, Prague and Vienna. He later took extended hikes through Switzerland and Italy, as far as Rome, keeping detailed diaries and making a huge number of sketches. Four years later, after getting married in Passau, he returned to Tartu, where he worked as a drawing teacher at a boys' school. His best known works, a series of aquatints commemorating the anniversary of the reopening of the University, date from this period. He then taught at a girls' school from 1829 to 1832. After that, once again taking to the road, he painted scenes throughout Estonia and on islands in the Gulf of Finland. Waterfall near Salzburg (1830s?) In 1837, following a successful exhibition in Saint Petersburg, he was designated a \\"free artist\\" by the Imperial Academy of Arts and, the following year, succeeded his mentor Senff as Professor of drawing at the University of Tartu. He held that position until 1851, when he was forced to retire due to increasingly poor eyesight. Three years later he gave up painting. Not wishing to remain idle, he discovered that his sight was still good enough to take up photography and his small salon became very popular. His daughter Julie Wilhelmine also became a well-known painter who married the astronomer Ludwig Schwarz. References  Further reading  * Epp Preem, from \\"Sechs deutschbaltische K√ºnster\\".

It was built between 1878 and the 1880s by the British as part of the Victoria Lines. It is still in use today by the Armed Forces of Malta as an ammunition depot. History Fort Mosta (left) and the Victoria Lines (right), as viewed from the limits of St. Paul's Bay Fort Mosta was built by the British as part of the Victoria Lines, a line of fortifications along the northern part of Malta, dividing it from the more heavily populated south. It is one of three forts built along the lines, the other two being Fort Binƒ°emma and Fort Madalena. The fort is the most strategically placed land fort along the Victoria Lines, occupying the cliff face at the mouth of Wied il-Gƒßasel. According to Giorgio Grognet de Vass√©, the site has had strategic value since ancient times and it was previously occupied by a Bronze Age citadel and village, and there were archaeological remains there.http://mostaarchives.smashyouagainstthewall.com/KtiebEBVella/Ktb_StorjaMosta_aTq02.html When the British requisitioned the site to build the fort, they probably destroyed the Bronze Age remains, although no actual proof of their existence is known. Despite this, catacombs dating to the 4th or 5th century AD were found under the fort and they still exist. The fort was last of the three major forts of the Victoria Lines to be built. Its construction was approved in 1873, but while construction the other forts begun in 1875 (Fort Binƒ°emma) or 1878 (Fort Madalena), work on Fort Mosta had not commenced by the visit of General Lintorn Simmons (who later became Governor of Malta in 1884) in February 1878. Construction began soon after his visit. The fort consists of two parts, a pentagonal keep, which is surrounded by a ditch, and a battery outside the keep. These were linked together with a sally port. Unlike the two other forts, Fort Mosta did not have RML guns since it was not intended for coastal defence. It was initially armed with 64-pounder smooth-bore muzzle loading guns, but later 6-inch breech-loading guns were installed. The Victoria Lines were abandoned in 1907, just eight years after they were completed, as they were deemed to be of dubious defensive value. Although Fort Binƒ°emma and Fort Madalena remained in use for coastal defence, Fort Mosta lost most of its military value. By 1940 it became an ammunition depot. Present day Fort Mosta is still used as an ammunition depot by the Armed Forces of Malta. It falls under the responsibility of the Ammunition Depot Guards, part of the Ammunition & Explosives, Storage & Disposal Squadron of the 3rd Regiment AFM. The Dog Section of the Malta Police Corps is also housed within Fort Mosta. Since it is still used by the army and police, the fort is not open to the public. Although the Armed Forces have made efforts to keep it in good condition, the fort requires special attention since it is built mainly on blue clay, and this is damaging the structure.

Content According to the publisher, the book describes the current state of cardiac arrhythmia treatment, and attempts to identify future directions research may take. Its 21 chapters cover a variety of topics related to cardiac arrhythmia and electrophysiology, primarily reviewing known molecular targets for drugs. Subjects covered in the book include both traditional approaches to looking at arrhythmia, such as ion channel effects, and more general issues such as the genetics behind differential response to existing drug therapies. Drug safety and side effects are also cover. The book examines avenues by which new treatments might be developed, with four chapters (10, 13, 16, 17) specifically focused on novel targets. Novel ideas offered included studying sodium-calcium exchanger and ryanodine receptor effects. One chapter (5) is dedicated to examining the targets on which existing drugs operate, and another (8) examines drugs in clinical trial at the time of publication. The chemical structure of existing drugs is not covered. Overall, the book advocates for segregating drug targets by disease type and state, rather than the conventional approach of segregating by likelihood to harm. In addition to pharmacological therapies, the book examines potential alternate treatments to arrhythmia including the effect of endurance training on susceptibility. It also investigates omega-3 fatty acids which have a proven effect on cardiac electrophysiology, but have failed to prove protective when obtained through diet. According to cardiologist Peter R. Kowey, the chapter authors are \\"eminent scientists\\" in their respective areas. The list includes \\"some brilliant industry scientists\\", but does not include any clinicians or drug trialists, possibly creating a biased perspective, according to Kowey. Response In a review for Circulation, Kowey called the book \\"an admirable attempt\\" to develop a more targeted approach to arrhythmia treatment, and said it was \\"illuminating and far reaching\\". He particularly liked the advocated approach of segregating drug targets by disease state. Kowey said the book's main weakness was a lack of focus on clinical issues ‚Äì both in topics covered and author selection. He noted that bringing drugs to the marketplace is expensive and proof of concept clinical trials are necessary to justify the investment. He said \\"Billman should be congratulated for his willingness to take on what is clearly an extraordinarily complex problem area\\" and praised him for \\"[encouraging] blue sky thinking\\" is his contributions to the book. He also congratulated the chapter authors for making \\"complex discussions not only interpretable, but topical\\". Kowey concluded \\"I would recommend this book to my colleagues and fellows, not only as a reference source, but as a compendium of information that summarizes where we are, and most importantly, the path we must take.\\" In a review for ChemMedChem, medicinal chemistry professor Ahmed S. Mehanna agreed that Novel Therapeutic Targets for Antiarrhythmic Drugs did not adequately cover clinical aspects of drug development. He also said the book could have been better organized and focused too heavily on describing known research, as opposed to the novel treatments implied by the book's title. He did, however, say the book \\"gives very valuable and comprehensive reviews of arrhythmia and its pharmacological management.\\" Mehanna said the book reviewed topics appropriately and was free of obvious errors. Overall, he recommended the book, calling it \\"a worthwhile addition to the literature on cardiac arrhythmia and antiarrhythmic drugs.\\" References Category:2010 non-fiction books Category:Books about science Category:Wiley (publisher) books Category:Medical books ","title":"Novel Therapeutic Targets for Antiarrhythmic Drugs"},{"id":"44926401","text":"The Lenborough Hoard is a hoard of more than 5,000 late Anglo-Saxon silver coins, dating to the eleventh century, that was found at Lenborough in Buckinghamshire, England in 2014. It is believed to be one of the largest hoards of Anglo-Saxon coins ever found in Britain. Discovery The hoard was discovered, on 21 December 2014, on farmland in the Buckinghamshire hamlet of Lenborough, between Buckingham and Padbury, during a metal detectorist rally organised by the Weekend Wanderers Detecting Club involving approximately one hundred people. One of the participants, Paul Coleman, located the coins inside a lead container buried under the ground. Coleman said that he \\"found a piece of lead and thought it was junk. But then I looked back in the hole and saw one shiny coin. Then I lifted a larger piece of lead and saw row upon row of coins stacked neatly.\\" According to Pete Welch, the founder of the club, the coins were in remarkably good condition: \\"They're like mirrors, no scratching, and buried really carefully in a lead container, deep down. It looks as though only two people have handled these coins, the person who made them and the person who buried them.\\" They were found protected in a \\"lead parcel\\" in the local heavy clay soil.http://www.bucksas.org.uk/newsletter/Newsletter_2015_2_3.pdf Buckinghamshire County Museum archaeologist Ros Tyrell, the Buckinghamshire Finds Liaison Officer for the Portable Antiquities Scheme, was present during the rally to record any objects discovered, and excavated the hoard immediately after it was found. The hoard was taken to the British Museum for examination and conservation. Contents The hoard consists of 5,252 silver coins, of which 5,251 are whole and one is a portion of a coin that had been cut in half. They date from the first half of the eleventh century, and include many coins from the reigns of two Anglo-Saxon kings, √Üthelred the Unready (reigned 978‚Äì1013 and 1014‚Äì1016) and Cnut the Great (reigned 1016‚Äì1035). The coins were wrapped in a sheet of lead. As the hoard consists of precious metal more than 300 years old, it will be assessed by a coroner under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996 to determine whether it is treasure. If found to be so, the hoard will be valued by the Treasure Valuation Committee, and a museum may apply to acquire it by paying the amount of the valuation, which will be shared equally by the discoverer and the landowner. The coins are in such good condition that their total value has been estimated at possibly as much as ¬£1.3 million. The reasons for the burial of the hoard are unknown. Valuation The Lenborough hoard has now been valued at ¬£1.35 million. Bucks County Museum hopes to save the hoard for the public and must raise the money. It has started an online appeal (see external links).

The story has been told about many rulers. It is numbered 53 in the Perry Index. The Fable An old man has a number of sons who constantly quarrel with each other. As he nears death he calls them to him and gives them an object lesson in the need for unity. Having bound a bundle of sticks together (or in other accounts either spears or arrows), he asks his sons to break them. When they fail, he undoes the bundle and either breaks each stick singly or gets his sons to do so. In the same way, he teaches them, though each can be overcome alone, they are invincible combined. The fable was included by Babrius in his collection. Later, Pseudo-Plutarch told the story of King Scilurus of Scythia and his 80 sonsSayings of kings and commanders p.174 and of other barbarian kings by other authors. The story also travelled eastwards. It may appear in mediaeval Turkic manuscript fragments and on a Sogdian mural.Vitterhetsakad.se Having entered Central Asian folklore, the story was also told of an ancestor of Genghis Khan.Timothy May, \\"Alan Goa and the arrow parable\\", The Mongol Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO 2016, vol.2, pp.4-6 Later history and interpretations The moral drawn from the fable by Babrius was that \\"Brotherly love is the greatest good in life and often lifts the humble higher\\". In his emblem book Hecatomgraphie (1540), Gilles Corrozet reflected on it that if there can be friendship among strangers, it is even more of a necessity among family members.Glasgow University When the Neo-Latin poet Hieronymus Osius included the fable in his 1564 collection, he added consideration of the effects of disunion: \\"Just as concord supplies potency in human affairs, so a quarrelsome life deprives people of their strength.\\"Fable 53 The French fabulist La Fontaine also stressed this aspect. In this version, the sons had not started quarreling when their father gave them his lesson, but descended into litigiousness over his estate following his death.Fables IV.18 That the lesson of the fable could be applied to statecraft as well as personal affairs had earlier been realised by Pseudo-Plutarch and those others who told the story of ancient rulers. In more modern times, Pieter de la Court commented on its applicability to the Dutch Republic in his retelling of the story in Sinryke Fabulen (Amsterdam, 1685) as \\"A farmer and his seven quarrelsome sons\\".Een Boer ende seeven twistende Soonen, pp.599-608 The story is prefaced with the proverb Eendragt maakt magt, een twist verkwist (Unity makes strength, strife wastes). The first part of this was eventually to be taken as national motto by a number of states in a variety of languages without necessarily referring to the fable. It was also associated with the fasces of the Roman republic, which consists of a bundle of rods, sometimes (but not always) enclosing an axe, symbolising the state's power to rule. However, the moral \\"Strength lies in union\\" was certainly given to the fable in, among others, Edward Garrett‚Äôs new edition of Aesop's fables in the 19th century.Published in London, 1867, pp.83-4 The political motto \\"Unity is strength\\" was definitely associated with the fable by the trade union organisations that adopted it. A depiction of a man kneeling over a bundle of sticks on the ground was used, often accompanied by the motto on, for example, the badge of the Nottinghamshire Miners Association, on a Durham trade union banner, and on a trade token of the Worcestershire Co-operative Society.Mining memorabilia Some of these show a man crouched with one knee on a bundle of sticks, straining to break them, in a pose that appears related to John Tenniel's picture of the scene in the edition of Aesop's fables that he illustrated.Laura Gibbs at Flickr The fable was also referred to by American trade union organisations in the 20th century,Archie Green, Calf's Head & Union Tale: Labor Yarns at Work and Play, University of Illinois, 1996, pp.251-3 and it was among those chosen in 1970 by the activist Jacob Lawrence for illustration in gouaches which draw out the story's moral truth.Pepe Karmel, ‚ÄúArt review:Pictures in children‚Äôs books‚Äù, New York Times, 18 August 1995‚ÄúThe bundle of sticks‚Äù (1969), Jacob and Gwen Lawrence legacy resource center Earlier the fable was retold in a long poem that made no reference to Aesop but was represented as happening in England. This first appeared as a 1795 illustrated broadsheet published in London and Bath with the title ‚ÄúThe old man, his children, and the bundle of sticks‚Äù. There ‚ÄúA good old man, no matter where, Whether in York or Lancashire,‚Äù gives the lesson on his deathbed and the poem concludes with a Christian reflection.Lewis Walpole Library, Yale University Over the following decades of the 19th century, it also appeared as a cheaply printed chapbook and in book-length collections of moralising works.Google Books References External links *Book illustrations from the 16th-19th centuries Category:Aesop's Fables Category:La Fontaine's Fables Category:Fictional families ","title":"The Old Man and his Sons"},{"id":"44926571","text":"Œ±-Endopsychosin is an antagonist of the phencyclidine site of the NMDA receptor which was discovered in extracts of porcine brain and may also be endogenous in humans.

Early Life  Dr. Reese was born in Baltimore, MD in 1862. He attended the University of Virginia for his undergraduate career. Upon graduation he was admitted to the University of Heidelberg in Heidelberg, Germany in 1884. While attending Heidelberg he was a student of Robert Bunsen. He received his Ph.D. in Chemistry in 1886.  Academic career  Dr. Reese's undergraduate degree was granted by the University of Virginia in 1884. He moved to Germany for his graduate studies. A student of Robert Bunsen at Heidelberg University and Viktor Meyer at the University of G√∂ttingen, Dr. Reese completed his PhD in 1886. Dr. Reese returned to the United States and took a position as an Assistant in Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University which he held until 1888. After a brief tenure as Professor of Chemistry at Wake Forest College, he became a Professor at The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina where he taught for 8 years. He returned to teach at Hopkins for another 4 years until turning to Industrial Chemistry in 1900. Industrial Career and DuPont In 1900, Dr. Reese took a position as Chief Chemist at The New Jersey Zinc Company. While there, he focused primarily on the contact process of sulfuric acid, developing it to a satisfactory working basis. As a result he drew the attention of the DuPont Company in 1902 and was appointed Chief Chemist. He established the Eastern Laboratory and was made Director. In 1906 he was placed in direct control of the Chemical Division of the High Explosives Operative Department. Promoted to Chemical Director of DuPont in 1911, he oversaw the development of new processes for creating raw materials needed for military explosives in World War I. During his tenure with DuPont, Dr. Reese was an instrumental player in the development of Research and Development practices at the company. Under his command as Chemical Director multiple labs were centralized and organized into a two prong strategy. Eastern Laboratory (Reese's original posting within DuPont) would focus on short term projects which could rapidly respond (and profit) to the demands of the market. In contrast, the Experimental Station would focus on long term, potentially risky projects. He defended the lack of immediate profitability by the Experimental Station, claiming it brought \\"enormous, though intangible, rewards\\" to DuPont. This belief lead to his decision regarding \\"complete and detailed\\" information on smokeless powder and refusal to break apart the research labs, despite pressure from Congress and the Company. > Within months of Reese's report, World War I began, and this decision proved > to be an enormous boon to the Du Pont Company. The cash generated by Du > Pont's smokeless powder sales during the war would create the capital > necessary for the company's ventures into other product lines, thus > providing the basis for Du Pont's rise as a giant, diversified company. > (pg.61) Dr. Reese retired from the Board of DuPont on January 1, 1931.

After brief tests SNCASE decided to concentrate on a closely related but single- tail-rotor design. Design and development The SE-3110 drew heavily on the design and development of the 1948 SE-3101, sharing much of the latter's control system and also its unusual twin tail rotors. Externally it was much more refined, with a rounded forward pod for occupants and engine and a slender tail boom. The two crew sat side by side behind a fully glazed nose; structurally the pod was a light monocoque. A Salmson 9 Nh nine cylinder, air- cooled radial engine was mounted horizontally under a transmission box attached to the fuselage by steel tubes and driving a three-blade rotor. Some sources give the engine as a Salmson 9 Nc, which was probably fitted to the first ground test article. The tail rotors were mounted above the end of the boom on shafts at right angles to it and to each other, so that the rotor planes were leaning inwards at 45¬∞ to the vertical. At least one image shows the drive shafts within slender fairings but several others show them bare. The SE-3110 landed on small wheels mounted on cantilever legs on each side and a long, forward-pointing, sprung skid. As on the SE-3101, differential pitch settings of the twin tail rotors compensated main rotor torque; there were mechanical linkages between the collective pitch, the throttle and the tail pitch control to lower the pilot's workload. Directional control was achieved by altering the tail pitch difference and the tail could be lifted or depressed, giving longitudinal control (aircraft pitch), in the same way. A new feature on the SE-3110 was longitudinal trim control via the main rotor cyclic pitch. The SE.3110 first flew on 10 June 1950, piloted by Jaques Lacarme. Gaillard states that the first prototype made only two flights at low altitude before being abandoned in favour of the SE-3120 Alouette I. However, other sources say that two SE-3110s were built, appearing on the French civil register initially as F-WFUD and F-WFUE, later transferring to the B list (after gaining their Certificates of Airworthiness) as F-BFUD and F-BFUE. In Liron's account the first prototype was retained for ground durability testing but the first flight of the second prototype on 15 September 1950 rapidly ended with loss of control and a side-on crash, though Lacarme walked away. SNCASE decided the way forward lay with the single tail rotor and with main rotor blades stabilized to prevent excessive flapping, both features of the SE-3120.

He later emigrated to South Australia where he briefly ran that new colony's first school then served for a short time as Protector of Aborigines. History Bromley, the eldest son of Robert and Julie Bromley, was baptised on 27 February 1775 in Keelby and grew up in rural Lancashire. He enlisted in the 23rd Regiment of Foot (better known as the Royal Welch Fusiliers) when quite young. He saw action in a number of overseas conflicts (including Nova Scotia 1808‚Äì1810), rising to the rank of captain. In 1811 he returned to England and retired on half pay. Canada In 1813 he returned to Halifax, Nova Scotia where he founded the Royal Acadian School over the thirteen years he lived there. His school offered education for middle- and low-income families, including girls, black and immigrant children. The school included Protestants and Catholics. The school was controversial, however, as some of its biggest supporters came from the Nova Scotia elite. Bromley also devoted himself to the service of the Mi'kmaq people.Thomas Akins. History of Halifax. p. 159 The Mi'kmaq were among the poor of Halifax and in the rural communities. According to historian Judith Finguard, his contribution to give public exposure to the plight of the Mi'kmaq \\"particularly contributes to his historical significance.\\" Finguard writes: :Bromley's attitudes towards the Indians were singularly enlightened for his day‚Ä¶. Bromley totally dismissed the idea that native people were naturally inferior and set out to encourage their material improvement through settlement and agriculture, their talents through education, and their pride through his own study of their languages. Bromley's school made a \\"seminal contribution\\" to the development of the education movement in Nova Scotia. Walter Bromley ‚Äì Canadian Biography Well after Bromley's departure from Nova Scotia (1825), the school continued to play a central role in the campaign for free education. It became a girls' school by the 1870s. Bromley returned to England around 1825 or 1826, married twice, and had several children. South Australia Bromley embarked, alone, for South Australia aboard Tam O'Shanter as part of the \\"First Fleet of South Australia\\", arriving in November 1836 at Kangaroo Island. There \\"Captain Bromley\\", as he was generally called, opened a school for 24 children at Kingscote on 5 December 1836.. This was not to last long however, as on 5 April 1837 he was appointed Protector of Aborigines, succeeding George Stevenson, and closed his school on 19 May 1837 and commenced his work, living among the Aborigines and learning their language. He was a poor choice for the job, The Register opined, a bad example to set younger Aborigines (but did not elaborate). He was removed from the position of Protector and replaced by Dr. William Wyatt (c. 1805 ‚Äì 10 June 1886). He drowned in the River Torrens, accidentally so the inquest concluded, The Southern Australian felt Bromley had been treated unfairly, and had done more for the natives than Wyatt.

It was designed by the local architect Harold Hardwick and built of stone.http://www.mudgeemuseum.com/?i=523/mudgee-architect Three years later he gifted it to the Church of England.Havilah Anglican Cemetery In 1921, St John's Church of England, Mudgee, founded a hostel to give girls residential accommodation whilst they were educated at Mudgee High School. The venture was housed at Bleak House, an 1860s mansion in Market Street, and the building and grounds were made available rent-free for three years by White. He later gave the property to the church. Due to financial difficulties the hostel closed in 1935 and the proceeds of the subdivision and sale of Bleak House were gifted, with White's permission, to the Church of England Diocese of Sydney.Bleak House, Mudgee: 150th Anniversary Horse racing From 1900 until his death, White was a member of the Australian Jockey Club and was an elected member of the committee from 1910 through to his retirement in 1940. He also served as a member of the Western Districts Racing Association executive. He was the breeder and owner of Rogilla, the chestnut Australian Thoroughbred gelding. Rogilla won in each of the six seasons that he raced as a three-year-old to an eight-year-old. An outstanding galloper, Rogilla won on wet or dry tracks recording 26 wins from 4¬Ω furlongs to 2 miles. White also owned Haxton, Open Air and Vigaro. He imported the sires Roger de Busli, Tippler, Buoyant Bachelor and Fresco. Later life and death In 1919 White bought St Bridgid's at 548 New South Head Road, Double Bay, as his Sydney residence. The house had been designed and built by the English architect Frederick Moore Simpson in 1897. On his death, White left an estate valued at ¬£354,968. St Brigid's was purchased by Woollahra Council in 1951 and was the home of Woollahra Municipal Library from 1957 until 2016. Havilah remains in the ownership of the White family.

As the tractor could be used as a truck 706 RTTN or Tatra 137. The advantage of a personal trailer was a possibility if anytime disconnect and replace trailer cargo (such as import workers for the construction and then the material on the site). Prospectively, there was also the military option. But at the time of construction of the prototype, Karosa developed a new bus ≈† series, so that a unified series with mass production finally received only bus RTO. Prototype trailer NO 80 was in trial operation in several bus enterprises (e.g. T√°bor, Bratislava, Gottwaldov, Brno, etc.). Then in 1962 it was permanently passed to Bratislava, and ran for 17 years. Tractor 706 RTTN was brought in when employees in enterprises also used it in freight transport (as originally planned). At the beginning of 21st century the trailer wreck was discovered in Slovakia. Gradually its restoration was demanded. It was first introduced to the public (along with also refurbished tractor 706 RTTN) in the summer of 2007 in Prague.

He belonged to the abbot family Khon of Sakya which had a precedence position in Tibet in this era. He held the title from 1331 to 1358, being the last Dishi before the takeover of the Phagmodrupa Dynasty in Central Tibet in the 1350s. Appointment as Imperial Preceptor In the four decades after the death of the abbot-ruler of Sakya Zangpo Pal in 1323, the functions of abbot-ruler (dansa chenpo) and Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) were held in turn by a number of his sons and grandsons. By this time, however, the ruling Khon family was split into four groups, each residing in a particular palace in Sakya. Kunga Gyaltsen was one of the younger sons of Zangpo Pal and belonged to the Lhakhang branch. His mother was Machig Yon Dagmo. During the reign of the great khan Yes√ºn Tem√ºr he was appointed to the title chang guhi gung, the meaning of which is unclear.Shoju Inaba, 'The lineage of the Sa skya pa: A chapter of the Red Annals', Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 22 1963, 110. After the death of his brother Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen in 1330, Kunga Gyaltsen was selected by the great khan Tugh Tem√ºr to become the next Dishi. In 1331 the incarnated hierarch of the Karmapa sect, Rangjung Dorje, arrived with a number of imperial officials to fetch Kunga Gyaltsen and bring him to the capital. Arriving to Dadu (Beijing) he was duly confirmed in his office by the new great khan and last Yuan emperor Toghon Tem√ºr on 19 July 1333.Luciano Petech, Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Y√ºan-Sa-skya period of Tibetan history. Rome 1990, p. 85-6. Decline and fall of Sakya rule At the beginning his authority as imperial preceptor was recognized in Tibet. This is seen by a set of religious rules that he issued in the great temple of Dadu in May 1336. A document preserved in the Zhalu Monastery in 1348 shows that he still had a say in Tibetan affairs at that time.Luciano Petech 1990, p. 86. His position was also strengthened by the appointment of his son Lotro Gyaltsen as abbot- ruler of Sakya in 1347.Luciano Petech 1990, p. 101. As common in the Khon family, he married and sired children before his full ordination as monk. However, he stayed in Dadu until his death in 1358 and was unable to interfere directly in the civil war that emerged from 1346. One of the 13 myriarchies of Central Tibet, Phagmodru, was headed by the strong-willed and ambitious Changchub Gyaltsen who involved in a complicated series of clashes with rival lords and the Sakya administrators (dpon-chen or ponchen). As Changchub Gyaltsen got the upper hand he managed to dominate √ú (East Central Tibet) by c. 1350. In 1354 he reduced the power of the Sakya elite to its immediate estates in Tsang (West Central Tibet).Luciano Petech 1990, pp. 108-10. Kunga Gyaltsen's brother-in-law, the influential lama Kunpangpa, was murdered in 1357 and in the next year Changchub Gyaltsen arranged a conference in Sakya which confirmed the transfer of power over Central Tibet to the new Phagmodrupa regime. Dissatisfied elements within Sakya were ruthlessly defeated.Luciano Petech 1990, pp. 119-27. During all these events, Changchub Gyaltsen continued to formally adhere to the Yuan Dynasty and received the title Tai Situ from the great khan. When Kunga Gyaltsen died in Dadu in the same year, no successor was appointed for some years. His nephew Sonam Lotro Gyaltsen briefly served as such in 1361-1362, when the Yuan dynasty was in its death throes.Luciano Petech 1990, p. 101.

Thomas \\"Corder\\" Pettifor Catchpool (15 July 1883 ‚Äì 16 September 1952), born Leicester, was an English Quaker and pacifist, actively engaged in relief work in Germany between 1919 and 1952. He was awarded the French Mons Star for his relief work with the Friends Ambulance Unit on the Western Front (1914-1916), subsequently imprisoned in Britain for his absolutist conscientious objection to the Compulsory Military Service Act 1916. After the First World War he was released from prison and critical of the implications of the Treaty of Versailles, played an active role in reconciliation with Germany: in 1919 he assisted with the Friends War Victims Relief Committee in Berlin, an organisation that was involved in organising the feeding of up to one million children per day. Returning to Britain he worked as a welfare coordinator for a Lancashire firm at Darwen, and was responsible for the invitation to Gandhi to visit the mill to witness the impact of the nonviolence campaign on conditions. Between 1931 and 1936 Catchpool worked out of the Friends International Centre in Berlin to assist those who were victims of anti-Semitism and other Nazi policies. His goal from 1933 onwards was \\"the prevention of progressive German isolation that could only lead to war\\".(Schmitt, p.63) He was arrested by the Gestapo in 1933 and temporarily detained, and he, his family and the Quaker German Yearly Meeting were subject to ongoing surveillance and intimidation. Demonstrating his concern for human rights extended to all people, Catchpool also embarked on several missions to campaign for minority Germans who were being deprived of their civil rights in Memelland in Lithuania, and Sudetanland in Czechoslovakia. For his latter work, Catchpool received the Czech Order of the White Line, fourth class (Officer), \\"for the magnificent work you have done as representative of the Society of Friends to alleviate the sufferings of children in the distressed areas of Czechoslovakia.\\"(p.139, Hughes) As an active member of the Peace Pledge Union during the Second World War, Catchpool joined secular pacifist Vera Brittain, non-pacifist Professor Stanley Jevons and others in setting up the Bombing Restriction Committee in 1942. The Committee called upon both Britain and Germany to stop the terror bombing of civilian targets, specifically urging the British government \\"to stop violating their declared policy of bombing only military objectives, and particularly to cease causing the deaths of many thousands of civilians in their homes.\\"(p.179, Hughes). In 1946, Catchpool returned to Germany to do relief work and in 1947, he and his wife Gwen were invited by the Friends Relief Service to run the Quaker Rest Home for ex-prisoners of the Nazis at Bad Pyrmont in Germany. During 1950 and 1951, Gwen and Catchpool represented the Friends Service Committee in West Berlin. Catchpool was educated in schools in Leicester and Sidcot Friends' School, and at Bootham School. He raised four children with his wife Gwen (n√©e Southall) who played an active part in his work.

The existence and nature of a purported male hysteria (hysteria masculina) was a debated topic around the turn of the century. It was originally believed that men could not suffer from hysteria because of their lack of uterus. This belief was discarded in the 17th century when discourse identified the brain or mind, and not reproductive organs, as the root cause of hysteria. During World War I, hysterical men were diagnosed with shell shock or war neurosis, which later went on to shape modern theories on PTSD. The notion of male hysteria was initially connected to the post-traumatic disorder known as railway spine; later, it became associated with war neurosis. History In the second half of the nineteenth century, hysteria was well-established as a diagnosis for certain psychiatric disorders. Although the original anatomical explanation of hysteria, the so- called wandering womb, was by this point abandoned, the diagnoses remained associated with (gender stereotypes of) females and female sexuality in the minds of physicians. Hysteria was joined in 1866 by a diagnosis for a very similar set of symptoms: railway spine, a nervous disorder caused by witnessing the accidents that the dangerous railways of the time generated in large numbers. John Eric Erichsen, who first diagnosed railway spine, explicitly rejected the hysteria diagnosis for his patients, arguing that diagnosing men with hysteria was unreasonable, \\"this term [being] employed merely to cloak a want of precise knowledge as to the real pathological state\\". Herbert Page, by contrast, argued for the hysteria label, finding what Erichsen called railway spine a functional disorder that was too similar to hysteria to warrant a separate diagnosis. The situation gradually began to change: in 1859, Paul Briquet remarked that \\"we saw little hysteria in men because we did not want to see it\\", and between 1875 and 1902, some three hundred medical articles were devoted to the topic of male hysteria, as well as dozens of dissertations. Jean-Martin Charcot. Statistical work in the 1880s finally turned the conception of hysteria on its head. In 1882, Jean-Martin Charcot had made a \\"radical\\" move by citing Briquet's estimate of hysteria having a 1:20 ratio of incidence in males compared to females, and added a section for male sufferers of hysteria to his Paris hospital, the Salpetri√®re. A subsequent German study came up with a 1:10 ratio, Georges Gilles de la Tourette then published a 1:2 or 1:3 estimate, and finally Charcot and his student Pierre Marie did a study of 704 cases of patients displaying symptoms of hysteria, finding that 525 of them were males. Before long, the French army became interested in the diagnosis and the nervous condition of its soldiers. Despite the notion of hysterical soldiers clashing with nationalist and revanchist ideas of the time, diagnoses of hysteria were soon made by military medical personnel. Male \\"traumatic hysteria\\", as defined by Charcot, was a distinct disease from female hysteria in that it was linked to traumatic shock rather than sexuality or emotional distress, so the gendered stereotyping was still at work to an extent in Charcot's thinking. This new category subsumed what British and American physicians had understood as railway spine. From Paris, Charcot's theories traveled east, carried by visitors to Charcot's hospital: the Germans Max Nonne and Hermann Oppenheim, and the Austrian Sigmund Freud. Nonne was originally skeptical, but ultimately became a proponent of the male hysteria diagnosis when dealing with the neurotics produced by the First World War. Oppenheim, on the other hand, was critical of Charcot's theories and sought to distinguish \\"traumatic hysteria\\" from \\"traumatic neurosis\\"; he and his colleague Thomsen found that the symptoms in their cases of railway spine were different enough from what was regarded as the symptoms of hysteria, at least in severity. Freud, in 1886, gave a paper about the topic of male hysteria to the Imperial Society of Physicians in Vienna. By this point, the incidence of \\"classical\\" hysteria in males was accepted by Freud's audience, but Charcot's traumatic variant was still controversial and evoked discussion among the present medical doctors. In later works, Freud would reject Charcot's distinction between the two types of hysteria, arguing that trauma is the cause of hysteria in both men and women, though he broadened the definition of trauma to include repressed memories of sexual experiences, and believed that recalling traumatic memories could cure hysteria. Freud even diagnosed himself and his brother with hysteria, but eventually dropped his own efforts and reverted to a theory of hysteria as a condition of the female body. His followers similarly would exhibit a gendered view of hysteria, associating it with latent homosexuality and the Oedipus complex. In Britain, Charcot's theories took on a different guise when it was suggested that hysteria in men was a disease of the \\"Latin races\\", to which Anglo-Saxon men were virtually immune. In Germany, too, a majority of the medical profession rejected Charcot's ideas, and medical journals circulated papers that labeled French men as more prone to hysteria than Teutons ‚Äî \\"which, in the context of the time, meant that they were weaker, less virile, and more susceptible to degeneration\\". An 1889 case study of hysteria in a German soldier gave the French doctors the ammunition they needed for a counterattack. Aside from French and Germans, indigenous inhabitants of various remote regions, colonial populations, Jews and (retroactively) pre- Civil War American slaves were charged with high incidence rates of hysteria by European and white American doctors and anthropologists. Ypres, 1917. In the lower left, a shell-shock sufferer. Toward the end of the century, female hysteria became increasingly an anti-suffragist label in the popular press and came under attack from rising feminism, while the wars of the early twentieth century brought new attention to the male variant. The Boer War and the Russo- Japanese War produced hysterical symptoms in veterans in large enough numbers that in 1907 the label \\"war neurosis\\" was introduced to describe their specific condition. For the disorders seen in World War I veterans, additional terms such as shell-shock (coined by Charles Samuel Myers), and (in France) pthiatiques and simulateurs were invented to prevent labeling soldiers with the \\"feminizing\\" label of hysteria. Charcot's earlier work, meanwhile, was ignored, and shell-shock sufferers were regarded by their physicians as displaying the symptoms of \\"womanish, homosexual or childish impulses\\".  Shell Shock and War Neurosis  Shell Shock or war neurosis are forms of hysteria that manifested in soldiers during war time, especially World War I. Symptoms that were previously considered somatic were reconsidered in a new light; trembling, paralysis, nightmares, mutism and apathy were grouped together in a broad spectrum psychological disorder known as ‚Äúwar neurosis‚Äù. By 1916 40% of casualties were in fighting areas were diagnosed with shell shock. As a consequence twenty more military hospitals were established specifically to treat these sufferers. The physical and emotional symptoms of war neurosis varies based on the military rank of the sufferer. However, sexual impotence stemming from a sense of powerlessness was common to all. Some of the physical symptoms displayed by low ranking officers were: *paralyses and limps *blindness * deafness * mutism (most common) * limb contractures * vomiting The symptoms displaying by ranking officers were more emotional/psychological in comparison to their soldiers: * nightmares * insomnia * fatigue * dizziness and disorientation * anxiety attacks World War I was the first instance in which a war neurosis and mental trauma was rampant and affected soldiers considerably. This could be attributed to the particular form of fighting ‚Äì trench warfare ‚Äì which was impersonal and constantly kept the soldier on edge for the next attack. Eric Leed writes that war neurosis was a result of the breakdown of the previously personal relationship of the soldier and his means of fighting. Rivers considered the idea that the traumatized men resorted to neurotic behavior because of a loss of their usual defense mechanism ‚Äì physical hand-to-hand combat. It was especially difficult for officers to maintain British ideals of masculinity. They were expected to be perfectly dressed, always motivated, and have a hunger for enemy blood, even though they were just as afraid and disillusioned as their soldiers. It does not come as surprise that war neurosis occurred four times more in officers than ordinary soldiers. Showalter argues that mental breakdowns of soldiers during the war was a form of protest against pre-conceived notions of Edwardian manliness that demand unifying patriotism and stoic lack of emotion. Treatment also depended on rank. Soldiers had to undergo disciplinary, quick treatments while officers had the luxury of psychotherapy.  Important Physicians   Jean- Martin Charcot  Charcot was born in 1825 and received his M.D. from University of Paris in 1853. He was appointed as associate professor of medicine in 1860, followed by a position of Head of Hospital Service at Salp√™tri√®re in 1862. Charcot published over sixty case reposts of hysteria in boys and young men between 1878 and 1893. He was dedicated to breaking the stereotype that Hysteria manifested wealth or homosexual men, and insisted that it occurred in manual laborers as well. He was of the belief that the physical signs and symptoms of hysteria were identical in both sexes but claimed that the condition presented itself differently in the minds of men and women. Most noticeable was that he did not attribute sexual factors to the conditions of his male patients. He was thus able to diagnose men with hysteria because he kept away from theoretically controversial issues such as sexuality.  W.H.R. Rivers  Captain Rivers was a Royal Army Military Corps physician who was the first Englishman to support Freud's work in psychoanalytic theory, and went on to pioneer the British Psychoanalytic Society after the war. He was a supporter of the \\"talking cure\\". Rivers‚Äô treatment drew heavily from Freud's ‚Äòtalking cure‚Äô, because he focused primarily on discussing hidden memories of trauma and dissecting war nightmares. Sassoon records that he would record his dreams to be dissected by Rivers. Both Freud and Rivers were united in their conviction that addressing traumatic memories was the only way to give full recovery.  Relationship with Siegfried Sassoon  Lt. Sassoon was diagnosed with war neurosis by the military review board following a dramatic anti-war declaration in May 1917. He was ordered to receive treatment at Craiglockheart War Hospital headed by Dr. Rivers. It is difficult to tell of Sassoon was truly suffering from war neurosis. Rivers diagnosed him as having a \\"strong anti-war complex\\", and thus Rivers set about trying to convince Sassoon to rejoin battle by hinting that pacifism was unpatriotic. Sassoon's interactions with Rivers along with his poetry hinted at a possible homoerotic element in the physician-patient relationship.  Craiglockheart War Hospital  Craiglockheart was the birthplace of innovation in psychoanalytic therapy as evidenced by Rivers' work. Unlike other shell shock hospitals of the time, Craiglockheart allowed officers to engage in therapeutic hobbies such as writing, sports and photography. The hospital magazine, Hydra was a wonderful insight into the minds of lower-ranked officers, physicians and nurses alike -\\"Within its pages are a series of fascinating and revealing cartoons depicting, among other things, the traumatic nightmares most of those at the hydro suffered, Rivers' mystical reputation, and the often mixed feelings of soldiers on leaving the place\\". The most famous anti-war poem, Dulce et decorum est was written at the hospital in 1917 by a renowned poet and war neurosis sufferer, Wilfed Owen.  Dr. Lewis Yealland  A Canadian-born medic, Yealland was an aggressive supporter of disciplinary treatment for war neurosis. He worked in Queen's Square during the war and to has been established that he and other medics tortured patients into recovery. He was among the first British physicians to use electric shock treatment and has been criticized heavily for doing so. In Yealland's view, patients were more amenable to the suggestion that they suffered from a physiological disturbance that could be potentially remedied by a physical treatment such as faradism.  Representations in popular culture   Regeneration by Pat Barker  Regeneration (1991) is the first of a series of novels that deals with the psychological trauma caused by World War I on English officers who fought on the front lines. The plot revolves around the character of Siegfried Sassoon, a decorated officer who is sent to Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh because he is said to be suffering from \\"Shell Shock\\".  Redeployment by Phil Klay  Phil Klay is a graduate of Dartmouth College and a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps. He served in Iraq's Anbar Province from January 2007 to February 2008 as a Public Affairs Officer. Redeployment (2014) is a collection of short stories that transports the readers into the minds of the soldiers in Afghanistan as well as those who have recently returned from the frontline. The book shows the struggle of its characters as they grapple with guilt, hopeless and fear as they try to rationalize life on the front lines and back home.

The site is significant as a well-preserved site (although slightly damaged by the presence of a 20th-century sporting camp over part of it) on an undammed river, and was, at the time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, expected to yield significant information about the area's prehistory. Description and history The site is located in the general vicinity of the mouth of the Big Black River, in a remote and hard-to-access portion of western Aroostook County. This area was identified by archaeologists as potentially of interest, because the rivers in the area had not been dammed to harness their power, which had the added consequence of destroying archaeological sites located on river banks.Sanger, David (May 1975); NRHP nomination for Big Black Site (redacted); available by request from the National Park Service The area's first major survey was performed in the 1920s by Warren K. Moorehead, who mentions finding habitation sites on the Big Black. Partly due to its remoteness, the area was for many years only subject to occasional spot surveys. In 1973 the area was surveyed by a team from the University of Maine at Orono, in which this site was identified. The site is about in size, and was at the time of the 1973 survey partially overlaid by a sporting camp, which had disturbed some of the upper levels of the site. Outside these areas, the site is well preserved, and shows signs of deep stratification, with layering suggesting dating from the Archaic Period (c. 4000 BCE) to historic times.

The escapade ended in Georgetown, British Guiana, with the arrest of the captain, George \\"Dod\\" Orsborne, and his brother. The pair were later imprisoned for the theft of the vessel. Built in 1935, Girl Pat was the property of the Marstrand Fishing Company of Grimsby. On 1 April 1936, Orsborne, with a crew of four and his brother James as a supernumerary, took the vessel out on what the owners authorised as a routine North Sea fishing trip of two to three weeks' duration. After leaving port, Orsborne informed the crew that they were going on an extended cruise in more southerly waters. Nothing more was heard of them until mid-May, when the owners, who had by then assumed the vessel lost, received invoices relating to its repair and reprovisioning in the northern Spanish port of Corcubi√≥n. Subsequent sightings placed her in the Savage Islands, at Dakar in Senegal, and √éles du Salut off the coast of French Guiana in South America. The captain's main means of navigation during a voyage of more than was a sixpenny school atlas and a compass. At one point Girl Pat was reported wrecked in the Bahamas, with all hands lost. After the vessel's capture and detention following a chase outside Georgetown on 19 June, Orsborne and his crew were hailed as heroes in the world's press. Charged with the theft of the vessel in October 1936, Orsborne maintained in court that the owners had instructed him to get rid of the ship, as part of a scheme to obtain its insurance value. This claim was dismissed by the court. Years later, in his memoirs, Orsborne told a different, uncorroborated story: in absconding with Girl Pat he had been carrying out a mission on behalf of British Naval Intelligence, connected with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936. After his release from prison, Orsborne took part in further maritime adventures and served in the navy in the Second World War. He died in 1957. In Georgetown Girl Pat was acquired by new owners who returned her to Britain, where she was displayed as a tourist attraction in several resorts. In 1939 she was sold to the Port of London Authority for use as a wreck- marking vessel and, after being requisitioned by the Royal Navy during the war, was returned to the authority in 1945. There is no public record of her subsequent career.  Background   Orsborne  Grimsby fishing vessels, early 20th century George Black Orsborne was born George Black on 4 July 1902, in the small north Scottish coastal town of Buckie. He assumed the Orsborne name when his widowed mother remarried and moved the family to Aberdeen, where George, nicknamed \\"Dod\\", spent his formative years. When he was 14, Orsborne lied about his age and enlisted as a Boy Seaman in the Royal Navy; in his memoirs he wrote: \\"I never did have an adolescence\\".Orsborne, p. 22 He served in the Dover Patrol, and was wounded during the 1918 Zeebrugge Raid. After leaving the Navy in December 1919 and working ashore for a brief period, he was persuaded by a former captain of the Cutty Sark, Captain Wilkins, to go back to sea. He joined the merchant navy, sailing mainly in small ships based in Liverpool. At 21 he passed his master's ticket examinations and took over his first command, a Grimsby trawler.Orsborne, pp. 37‚Äì38 During the following ten years, Orsborne said his career included \\"a bit of everything‚Äîrum-running, whaling, deep-sea trawling in the Arctic\\".Orsborne, p. 40 In November 1935, back in Grimsby, he became skipper of the former seine fishing boat Gipsy Love, which its owners, the Marstrand Fishing Company, had converted into a trawler.  Crew and vessel  In March 1936, for his second voyage in Gipsy Love, Orsborne attempted to engage the services of an experienced seaman, Alexander MacLean, to whom he confided that the trip might go further afield‚Äîperhaps to Bermuda or South America‚Äîbut MacLean declined the opportunity. Orsborne offered the mate's berth to Harry Stone, a local seaman who did not possess a mate's ticket but was told by Orsborne that he could use MacLean's number. The other crew members were a Yorkshireman, Hector Harris, and a 17-year-old Scottish cook, Howard Stephens. The formal crew was joined by Orsborne's younger brother James, a grocer, who had no formal status on board and was later classified as a stowaway. Gipsy Love left Grimsby late in March 1936, supposedly to fish in the Dogger Bank area of the North Sea, but within hours had returned to port with engine trouble. With the consent of the owners, Orsborne transferred stores and crew to another Marstrand vessel, the small trawler Girl Pat; James Orsborne again joined them. Built in 1935 in Oulton Broad, Suffolk, Girl Pat was a vessel of 55 gross registered tons (GRT), 19 NRT. She was long, with a beam of , a hold depth of , and accommodation for six. Some sources refer to her as a \\"seine netter,\\" suggesting that like the Gipsy Love she had been converted to trawling.Hewitson, Ch. 1 (Unpaginated ‚Äì section: \\"The Ocean At Our Doorstep\\") She was insured with underwriters for ¬£3,000. Her regular engineer, George Jefferson, was added to Orsborne's picked crew for the forthcoming voyage.  Voyage   First phase: Grimsby to Corcubi√≥n  Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, when they entered the open sea, Orsborne assembled the crew‚Äîexcept for Jefferson‚Äîin the wheelhouse and told them that this would not be a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls. The northern Spanish town of Corcubi√≥n (photographed in 2011), where Girl Pat rested in April 1936 On 3 April the craft reached Dover, where Jefferson was taken ashore and given food and drink. When he returned to the harbour, Girl Pat had departed; the engineer returned in some confusion to Grimsby. As Girl Pat sailed into the English Channel, Orsborne revealed to his crew that the vessel contained no charts, and that future navigation would be dependent on a cheap school atlas that he showed them. He changed details in the boat's log book, entering himself as \\"G. Black,\\" Stone as \\"H. Clark,\\" and James Orsborne as \\"A. Black\\". After anchoring off Jersey in the Channel Islands to await calmer weather, Girl Pat proceeded southwards through the Bay of Biscay. Orsborne ordered changes to the boat's appearance: the bowsprit was altered, and the fishing registration number on the side of the hull was blacked out. According to Stone, Orsborne indicated an itinerary that included Madeira, the Canary Islands, the African coast and, eventually, Cape Town. They might then sell the boat and share the proceeds. Severe weather in the Bay of Biscay hampered progress and battered the small vessel, and on 12 April they took shelter in the small northern Spanish port of Corcubi√≥n, where they stayed for around 14 days. Necessary repairs were carried out, and the boat was reprovisioned. Orsborne instructed that the accounts for these services, totalling ¬£235, be sent to Marstrand's in Grimsby, as their punishment, he later said, for letting the boat be taken out with inadequate stores and equipment. Following Jefferson's return to Grimsby, Marstrand's were puzzled by Orsborne's actions, but initially thought that he had taken on another engineer in Dover and had gone fishing, perhaps in new grounds. There were unconfirmed sightings of Girl Pat in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. As weeks passed with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or barratry, and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling ¬£2,400 from the underwriters, when they were surprised by the arrival of bills from Corcubi√≥n, together with the news that Girl Pat had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.  Second phase: Corcubi√≥n to Dakar  Reefs on the deserted coastline of the Savage Islands After Girl Pat left Corcubi√≥n, there was speculation in the port that Orsborne intended to fish in the waters around Gibraltar, but there was no sighting of the vessel in that vicinity. Stone later recalled that after sailing for some time, they arrived at some uninhabited islands‚Äîthis is consistent with a probable sighting by the British liner SS Avoceta, which on 17 May reported seeing a vessel closely matching the trawler's description, anchored in the Savage Islands. This small uninhabited archipelago, roughly south of Madeira and roughly the same distance north of the Canary Islands, had long been associated with stories of pirates' buried treasure, and news that Girl Pat had been seen there gave rise to press speculation that she was engaged on a hunt for treasure. Lloyd's of London sent a representative to Las Palmas, to investigate the sighting; meanwhile Girl Pat made an unobserved call at Tenerife in the Canary Islands, where she was repainted. Leaving Tenerife, Girl Pat continued her journey southward, following the African coast. According to Stone's account, the crew went ashore at Port Etienne in French West Africa (now Nouadhibou, in Mauritania), leaving the boat unguarded. While they were away, marauders stole gear and provisions, leaving the crew almost destitute: \\"All we had left to eat and drink were four bottles of water, a tin of corned beef, a bottle of lime juice and a tin of condensed milk\\". Leaving Port Etienne, they ran aground on a sandbank and were stranded for three days. Eventually they managed to refloat the vessel, and on 23 May were picked up by a pilot boat which brought them into the harbour at Dakar, starving and exhausted. Stone had fallen ill with appendicitis during the previous leg of the voyage; he was hospitalised in Dakar and took no further part in the adventure. Orsborne was able to obtain further fuel and water, but Girl Pat's arrival attracted the attention of the local Lloyd's agent, who had been on the lookout for the vessel. On 26 May he saw Orsborne and inspected the log book, where he discovered the false names and other inconsistencies. Orsborne was asked to present the ship's papers at the British consulate but, on the pretext that he needed to test the engines, he rapidly put to sea. The appearance of Girl Pat in Dakar‚Äîthe first confirmation since Corcubi√≥n that the vessel was still afloat‚Äîwas widely reported. Relatives of the crew members were relieved that those aboard were safe but were apprehensive about what might lie ahead.  Third phase: Dakar to Georgetown  The level of public interest in the Girl Pat affair was enough for Gaumont British to consider making it the subject of a feature film. In the House of Commons on 29 May, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade stated that no requests had been made for the detention of the vessel in foreign ports; two weeks later, Walter Runciman, the President of the Board of Trade, confirmed that, on behalf of the underwriters, the Foreign Office had asked that Girl Pat be refused credit and detained on entering any port. The √éles du Salut, where Girl Pat is believed to have watered after crossing the Atlantic On 2 June the French liner Jamaique reported a small boat, flying the British flag and steaming southwards, near the Bissagos Islands south of Dakar. Although this was at first assumed to be Girl Pat, the next reported sighting, on 9 June, was more than to the west, on the other side of the Atlantic. Captain Jones of the Lorraine Cross, an American ship, cabled Lloyds' agents in Georgetown, British Guiana (now Guyana) with an account of a small ship flying a distress signal off the South American coast, north-east of Cayenne. There were apparently four men on board. The boat's name and markings had been painted out, but she claimed to be the \\"Margaret Harold\\" bound for Trinidad from London. Jones thought the crew's behaviour suspicious, and when he asked to see the ship's papers, the ship lowered the distress signal and sped away. Jones said the vessel was \\"undoubtedly a British fisherman\\", and thought it was Girl Pat. In Grimsby, a Marstrand spokesman expressed little surprise at this new location, and confirmed that the ship had sufficient speed to have crossed the ocean in the time since her last confirmed sighting. A check with Lloyd's indicated that there was no registered ship named Margaret Harold. A report from the √éles du Salut, a few miles off the coast of French Guiana, indicated that a vessel similar in appearance to Girl Pat had watered there on 10 June. An air search, by a Pan-American aircraft, covered over of coastline around Georgetown, without sighting the craft. On 17 June several newspapers carried reports of the discovery of the wreck of a small boat, and three bodies, at Atwood Cay, a small island in the Bahamas. Much of the press assumed this to be Girl Pat; one headline read \\"Did School Atlas Course Lead Crew to Death?\\". The reports proved false when, early in the morning of 19 June, a police launch towed Girl Pat into Georgetown harbour.  Capture, detention and arrest  The City Hall, Georgetown On the evening of 18 June the British steamer Arakaka had spotted a small ship a few miles outside Georgetown, and radioed this information to the shore. An unarmed police launch left Georgetown to investigate; as they approached, the crew of the as yet unidentified vessel became hostile. They denied that she was Girl Pat and threatened violence should officers attempt to board her. The launch retreated to Georgetown, where the police armed themselves and obtained authority to seize the suspect vessel. They returned early the following morning to find that their quarry was departing. A two-hour chase ensued, which The Hull Daily Mail glamorised as a sporting contest: \\"Like some coursing greyhound the faster Government ship stuck to the tail of the fleeing suspect which, harelike, doubled back on her course to dodge her pursuer\\". According to the British Daily Worker, the chase \\"[outdid] the most spectacular efforts of film directors\\". Finally, while manoeuvring at close quarters, the vessels collided. The stern of the suspect boat was severely damaged, whereupon she surrendered and was taken in tow. The name displayed on the vessel's hull was \\"Kia-ora\\", but Stephens quickly admitted to their captors that the ship was Girl Pat. With Girl Pat secured and under guard in Georgetown harbour, the Orsborne brothers, Harris, and Stephens were taken to police headquarters in the City Hall. The police issued a statement that the four were there \\"at their own request. They are under no form of detention\\". In London, officials struggled to establish the exact legal position, and issued confusing statements. Meanwhile, Orsborne and his companions were widely hailed as heroes. The German newspaper Hamburger Fremdenblatt asked: \\"Is this not a bit of British tradition, to do the unconventional out of love for adventure, if great personal risks, audacity and romance are connected therewith?\\".Hamburger Fremdemblatt, quoted in A man from the town of Hull thought the adventure demonstrated \\"the spirit of Drake\\", and called for a public subscription to meet the crew's debts and expenses. An alternative view, expressed in the Hull Daily Mail, was to question whether the men should be regarded so favourably, or merely as \\"men who have run away with someone else's property\\". Once released by the police, Harris and Stephens returned immediately to England, where they arrived on 13 July. The Orsborne brothers waited in Georgetown for their position to be clarified; George Orsborne told the press he was anxious to return home where, he insisted, many job offers were open to him. On 27 June, following further discussions in London, the brothers were arrested on a warrant issued under the Fugitive Offenders Act, and brought before the Georgetown magistrates, where they were charged with the theft of Girl Pat.  Hearings, trial and sentence   In Georgetown  The brothers were held in custody, awaiting a deportation hearing. On 4 July they were remanded for a further week, and bail was again refused. Although the brothers declared their willingness to waive the deportation process and accept immediate transfer to England, they continued to be detained. On 22 July the hearings in the Georgetown magistrates' court finally began, with the formal identification of Girl Pat. On 24 July the magistrates ordered that the brothers be sent to England to face trial, once the formal approval of the colonial governor, Sir Geoffry Northcote, had been given. The governor was in no hurry to act; the Orsbornes finally left Georgetown on 13 August, when they boarded the cargo liner . While the Orsbornes were in Georgetown, Harold Stone, Girl Pat's erstwhile mate, made his way home from Dakar and arrived in Liverpool on 20 July. After interviews with the police, Stone spoke to the press of the hardships suffered during the Girl Pat voyage, especially the shortages of food and water: \\"I would not want to go through the experience again\\". He confirmed that they had navigated using a school atlas, but added that they had possessed a compass.  Bow Street, London  Early on 2 September Inanda docked at Gravesend, Kent. The brothers were immediately driven to London for a formal appearance at Bow Street Magistrates' Court, where they were charged with theft and conspiracy. Against police opposition‚Äîbecause, they said, \\"certain developments\\" might arise‚Äîthe magistrate bailed each defendant in the sum of ¬£500, and required them to surrender their passports. When the hearing resumed on 10 September, the court heard from Marstrands' managing director that George Orsborne had not been given authority to operate Girl Pat outside the North Sea. Stone testified that Orsborne had made plain his intentions to take the boat south from the outset, and also gave evidence concerning the changes to the ship's log. The court heard from Jefferson and other Dover witnesses, from Alexander MacLean, and from the Lloyd's agent in Dakar. The defence counsel did not answer the detailed aspects of the prosecution's case, but stated that at the forthcoming trial, \\"very serious allegations\\" would be made against certain of the prosecution witnesses. The brothers pleaded not guilty, and were remanded on continuing bail for trial at the Old Bailey. In the interval between the Bow Street hearings and the trial, which was set to begin in October, Girl Pat was sold.  Old Bailey  The entrance to the Central Criminal Courts at the Old Bailey The Old Bailey trial began on 19 October 1936. The prosecution opened by stating that this should not be considered as \\"a cheerful buccaneering adventure,\\" but as a breach of trust on the part of George Orsborne, to whom the owners had entrusted their ship. The objective of the voyage had not been to benefit the owners, but to make money for the defendants. MacLean testified that in his discussions with George Orsborne, he had formed the impression that the captain was part-owner of the vessel. Orsborne had mentioned to him the possibility of engaging in profitable activities such as gun-running and smuggling. John Moore, the managing director of Marstrand's, stated that he had expected Orsborne to take Girl Pat fishing in an area of the North Sea where another Marstrand vessel was fishing successfully. When Moore was cross-examined, the defence's \\"serious allegations\\" were revealed. It was put to Moore that he had instructed George Orsborne not to go fishing, but to get rid of the vessel so that the company could claim its insurance value, of which Orsborne would be rewarded with a share. The defence alleged that the company was in poor financial shape, and that its ships were heavily mortgaged. Moore denied that he had made any such suggestion to Orsborne. The company, he insisted, was financially sound, the mortgages on its vessels were relatively low, and he had never discussed insured values with Orsborne. The defence further alleged that when taken out Girl Pat had been in an unseaworthy condition, inadequately provisioned and unfit for a normal fishing voyage. This suggestion was also denied by Moore. After Stone and Jefferson reprised the evidence they had given in Bow Street, George Orsborne took the stand. He said he had not agreed to Moore's proposal to \\"lose\\" the vessel, and after departing with Girl Pat had still been undecided about what he would do. He had left Jefferson in Dover because he was a poor mechanic and a drunk. Moore, he asserted, was mistaken in claiming that the boat's provisions and equipment were adequate. Orsborne said that while the boat was sheltering in Jersey, he had suggested to the crew that they \\"may as well make a holiday of it\\", and then proposed that they make a circle of the Atlantic Ocean before returning to Grimsby. There was no intention to fall in with Moore's scheme or to steal the vessel; they would \\"thank the owners for the loan of the ship\\" and return it. Orsborne added that while they were in port at Corcubi√≥n, he was offered money for Girl Pat, but turned it down. Orsborne denied that he had tried to conceal his or the boat's true identity in Dakar, or had left the port to avoid enquiries‚Äîthe sudden departure was due, he said, to troubles with the natives. Nor had he attempted to evade the authorities in Georgetown; his movements there had arisen from concern for the safety of his vessel, which was being jeopardised by the manoeuvres of the police launch. James Orsborne, giving evidence, said that he had learned from his brother about Moore's proposal to get rid of the boat, and had told George that he would be \\"a darned fool\\" even to consider the suggestion. He had stayed with his brother because \\"I thought that if he was going to do anything crazy I might manage to prevent him\\". Recalled to the witness box, Moore said that he had refused to employ James Orsborne because he considered him dishonest. In his closing speech, defence counsel said that the key to the case was whether the Orsborne brothers intended to deprive the owners permanently of their vessel. The evidence, he said, was more suggestive of a \\"joy-ride half-way round the world\\", than of theft or anything more sinister. Prosecuting counsel argued that if the month's joy-ride was the innocent explanation, why had it been necessary to introduce into the case the unfounded allegations of proposed insurance fraud \\"against men whose reputations were above suspicion?\\". In his summing up, the judge condemned the arrangements whereby the Orsbornes were receiving money from the press for the rights to their story. This was unwarranted and undesirable: \\"Whether the two prisoners be guilty or innocent [of theft], the property of someone else was being used by them without permission ...George Orsborne clearly knew that he was acting directly against his employer's interests\\". The jury was out for only 35 minutes before returning guilty verdicts against both defendants. On 22 October George Orsborne was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, and James to 12 months.  Orsborne's alternative account  Thirteen years after the trial, in a memoir entitled Master of the Girl Pat published by Doubleday, George Orsborne provided a new context for the Girl Pat voyage. According to this narrative, he had been recruited in 1935 to work for British Naval Intelligence.Orsborne, pp. 77‚Äì78 The Girl Pat venture was a secret assignment, connected with the imminent Spanish Civil War.Orsborne, pp. 115‚Äì17 Between the stops at Corcubi√≥n and Dakar, Orsborne claims, he carried out a mission to blow up a railway bridge in Spanish Morocco.Orsborne, pp. 122‚Äì26 The stops at Port Etienne, Dakar and elsewhere had been to receive further instructions from Naval Intelligence.Orsborne, pp. 130‚Äì36 In this later account Orsborne changes crew names and other details: Stone becomes \\"Fletcher\\", and his leaving the voyage in Dakar is recorded by Orsborne as a \\"desertion\\".Orsborne, p. 141 Some of Orsborne's dates are inconsistent with the boat's known movements‚Äîhe gives 26 June as the date of arrival in Dakar,Orsborne, p. 137 and the account he gives of his Old Bailey trial bears no relation to the published record.Orsborne, p. 170 Orsborne describes his stay in Wormwood Scrubs prison as \\"a wonderful experience. I wouldn't have missed it for anything\\".Orsborne, p. 71  Aftermath  After the trial, the press and public remained broadly sympathetic to the Orsborne brothers. During the committal stages The Spectator had commented that the adventure \\"had given romantic satisfaction to the whole world\\" and that her captain had become a national hero. On the day after the sentencing, The Times leading article noted the public's sustained pleasure in the escapade. Nearly 30 years later, in his social history of the between-the-wars years, Ronald Blythe portrayed the affair as an anti- establishment gesture, \\"a colourful snook cocked in the face of some of the most soul-crippling officialdom ever experienced by ordinary men and women\\".Blythe, p. 193 While in prison, George Orsborne lent his name to a ghost-written account of the Girl Pat adventure, which repeated the claim that the vessel had been sent out inadequately equipped and provisioned. Marstrand's successfully sued the publishers, Hutchinsons, and two newspapers which had repeated the details. On his release, Orsborne planned to make a single-handed transatlantic crossing in an open boat, but the trip was delayed, and finally cancelled when war began in September 1939. Likewise, nothing came of an announcement in 1938 that Orsborne would lead an expedition to the Caribbean and up the Amazon. During the war, Orsborne worked as mate on a trawler which formed part of Britain's anti-invasion force, before rejoining the Royal Navy. His wartime exploits included service as a beachmaster during the Normandy landings of June 1944,Neillands and De Normann, p. 271 a spell as a commando in Combined Operations, and service in the Far East, where he records being captured and imprisoned by the Japanese.Orsborne, pp. 217‚Äì26 In September 1947 Orsborne was one of two men rescued in mid-Atlantic from the abandoned ketch Lovely Lady; the other was a stowaway, a Spanish greengrocer. In his 1949 memoir Master of the Girl Pat, George Orsborne records briefly that Stephens went straight back to sea after the adventure, that Harris drank up his share of the crew's newspaper money, and that \\"Fletcher\\" (Stone) emigrated to Australia. James Orsborne worked for a while in the Mediterranean, assisting refugees from the Spanish Civil War. Later he went to Canada. He was in Singapore when it fell to the Japanese in February 1942, and was not heard from again.Orsborne, pp. 174‚Äì75 George Orsborne died on 23 December 1957, at Belle √éle off the Brittany coast, while delivering a motor- cruiser from Nice to England.  Later years of ship  Girl Pat was repaired and refitted in Georgetown by her new owners, the Grimsby-based firm Girl Pat Ltd, (select page 594) and was brought back to England, arriving at Portsmouth on 9 May 1937 She remained there for two weeks as a tourist attraction, before moving to London on 28 May. Her new owners declared that they were still undecided as to the ship's longer-term future, but for the time being she would be displayed at Blackpool and other holiday resorts. On 17 February 1939 The Times reported that Girl Pat had been sold to the Port of London Authority (PLA), to be used as a wreck-marking vessel. After the outbreak of war in September 1939, she was requisitioned by the Admiralty for naval use, and is listed as one of the \\"minor war vessels\\" in service in July 1940. By 1945 she had been returned to the PLA; there is no public record of her subsequent history. The name Girl Pat was adopted by at least one later registered vessel; in August 1966 a 60-ton yacht of that name was arrested by Greek coastguards in the Gulf of Corinth and its occupants charged with the theft of antiquities.

One of her works Uanda is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. Her artworks are held in a number of major Australian galleries. Biography Nellie McCredie was born in Sydney on 27 May 1901, the daughter of Robert Smail McCredie and his wife Nellie.New South Wales Index of Births.12280/1901 MCCREDIE, NELLIE Her siblings were Robert, Allan, Ina and George. McCredie was a member of a leading architectural family with associations with Queensland as well as New South Wales. She was the niece of well-known Sydney architects Arthur Latimer and George McCredie who from 1889 to 1893 opened a Brisbane office, as McCredie Brothers and Chambers. When George McCredie died suddenly in 1903, Arthur McCredie continued the practice with his son Leith. The firm merged with Arthur Anderson and became McCredie and Anderson in 1903. Nell McCredie graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture from the University of Sydney in 1923, one of Australia's earliest architectural graduates. After graduating, she worked briefly for Dorman, Long and Company, contractors for the Sydney Harbour Bridge. In July 1925, she worked for Lawrence and Lourdain Architects in Cairns for four months, then came south to Brisbane where she was employed from November 1925 to early 1929 as a Draftswoman in the Workers' Dwellings Branch (WDB) of the State Advances Corporation. Due to the discovery of Nell's archive in 2013, it is now possible to identify the houses she designed while working for the WDB. She designed six known houses while working in this department, located in Brisbane inner city suburbs, Montville, and Cairns. It was during this time that she designed Uanda as a private commission. Nell McCredie was concerned with improving the quality of life of the average Australian. In her Bachelor of Architecture thesis she advocates simple, chaste buildings in \\"appropriate\\" settings generously planted with trees, illustrating her ideas with \\"a pretty suburban cottage\\" not unlike Uanda in its symmetry, central entrance porch and simple hipped roof. In her preference for simple, classic buildings McCredie reflects the ideals of her university teachers, including Professor Leslie Wilkinson. Like many of her women contemporaries, her practice of architecture was not to be sustained. Having studied pottery in Brisbane under the master craftsman, LJ Harvey, McCredie returned to Sydney in 1932 where she became a professional potter, setting up a commercial pottery at Epping in partnership with her younger brother Robert Reginald (Bob) McCredie. She exhibited actively with the New South Wales Society of Arts and Crafts into the 1950s and in 1951 won the Society's Elizabeth Soderberg Memorial Award for pottery. Pottery by the McCredies is well regarded for its simplicity and craftsmanship. It is represented in five public collections in Australia: National Gallery of Australia, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Powerhouse Museum (Sydney), Art Gallery of South Australia and Shepparton Art Gallery. Uanda is currently the only identified work of architect and potter McCredie. Her career is typical of the careers of women who entered the architectural profession prior to World War II. These early women architects were rarely able to sustain their careers and as a result, examples of their work are extremely rare. Only three Brisbane buildings, including Uanda, have been identified. The other two were designed by Elina Mottram who practised in Brisbane from 1924 to 1926.

He has been working in the field of music for over 20 years. His most notable work to date is as the songwriter/composer for the song \\"Everything Is Awesome\\", written for the Warner Brothers feature film The Lego Movie (2014). Early life Shawn Patterson was born in the small rural town of Athol, Massachusetts, to blue collar working parents, Ronald and Joan Patterson. His father was a gifted musician playing several instruments including: saxophone, guitar, trumpet, and pedal steel. However, Patterson's very first draw to music came from watching comedian Steve Martin play the banjo on television during his Let‚Äôs Get Small Tour. Martin's banjo playing was so influential, Patterson begged his parents to purchase a 5-string banjo and began taking lessons studying Bluegrass and Dixieland styles of music. Although he was jamming along with his father, Patterson grew bored with the instrument after a year and began tampering with the banjo, attempting to attach a pickup to the head and run it through a guitar amplifier owned by a friend from school. Eventually, he switched to electric guitar. In June 1977, Patterson and his father attended a screening of Star Wars and this was the first time film music caught his attention and a career was born. Patterson was already a huge Superman fan and at the age of four years was watching black and white reruns of The Adventures of Superman with George Reeves. With great anticipation, he awaited the release of Superman in 1978 and was forever changed as a result of John Williams‚Äô infamous score. Patterson then attended multiple screenings of the film just to try and absorb the music. On June 2, 1979, Patterson's father died after suffering a brain aneurysm leaving him, his two brothers and mother, Joan Patterson. As a result, Patterson devoted himself completely to music and his guitar playing. He was soon exposed to rock bands such as Van Halen, AC/DC, Queen and The Who. With the release of the Blues Brothers film in 1980, Patterson was heavily drawn to the influences of the film's soundtrack and band: Elmore James, Sam and Dave, and Booker T and the MG's. For the next four years, he was consumed by practicing and began writing songs. He played in and out of local bands until he graduated from Athol High School in 1983 and attended Berklee College of Music on scholarship at age 17. At Berklee, Patterson was exposed to great and talented musicians from around the world, often befriending and jamming with the most talented musicians he found. However, he experienced tremendous discomfort in his left hand most likely due to a broken left collarbone as a child and began experimenting with composition while at Berklee; often sitting in the piano practice rooms, teaching himself piano and sketching out musical ideas. Upon leaving Berklee at the end of summer 1983, Patterson resumed playing in and around Massachusetts, teaching guitar lessons in local music stores and privately. He began studying with local legendary jazz educator and pianist Mark Marquis, who steered him to the Fitchburg Public Library with the instructions to start exploring their jazz record collection. Patterson's musical voyage took a serious turn as he discovered a wide range of jazz styles that would forever alter his musical course: Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Joe Pass, Miles Davis, Art Blakey, Charlie Christian, Jim Hall and Wes Montgomery were beacons of inspiration which resulted in his dedication to studying with Marquis on guitar. Many times he would study for periods of 12 hours a day. At this time, Patterson began to experiment writing a wider range of song writing material, having also been heavily influenced by Count Basie, Duke Ellington and the Benny Goodman Sextet. In 1986, Patterson left for Los Angeles to attend the Grove School of Music exploring his options of living in LA to earn a living in music. Prior to moving, Patterson worked a wide range of odd jobs around Massachusetts to sustain himself including: furniture assembly, a convenience store, and a plastic factory. While at the Grove School of Music, Patterson worked full-time during the night shift as security guard on Sunset Boulevard and would attend college in the daytime. Upon completion at Grove, he returned to Massachusetts, continued his private studies with Marquis and began playing around the state in various jazz ensembles he led. In 1988, Patterson accepted a scholarship to attend the prestigious Jazz in July program and University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Patterson was hand selected out of many students to study privately and perform with the featured legendary educators and musicians, Dr. Billy Taylor and Max Roach. However, he never lost sight of his dream to compose music to picture and he wrote music for a few independent documentaries. With $400 in his pocket and a few guitars in his backseat, Patterson drove to Los Angeles in 1990 to relocate permanently. He played some live gigs on occasion with friends he had met through Grove, but his priority was to build a small studio and begin producing his own music to get composing work. He landed a job as a production assistant at the animated television show, Alvin and the Chipmunks, where in 1991, he sold his very first song for one of the albums of the series. The song was a rap song, ‚ÄúRock The House‚Äù, of which he wrote the music and lyrics. At this time, Patterson was renting various people's small project studios to produce his own compositions and began writing for trailer houses writing the music for large international ad campaigns such as: The Fisher King, My Girl, and several others. Still not able to earn enough money to survive, Patterson moved on to The Ren & Stimpy Show as Operations Manager. Soon, however, he moved into the audio/post production department and began working as a music editor. Here on the show, Patterson spent 8‚Äì10 hours a day cutting music to picture and experimenting with various classical styles to not only continue to the show's tradition of music but to push it into new territory stylistically. Patterson continued selling his own music where he could and soon was being asked to write original songs and bits of score for the show. Among several things, Patterson wrote a series of featured big band songs in the style of Frank Sinatra for the episode, ‚ÄúOl‚Äô Blue Nose‚Äù directed by Steve Loter and sung by Billy West. As The Ren & Stimpy Show came to an end, Patterson was already working as a freelance composer and songwriter. Billy West handed Patterson's demo CD out around Los Angeles and it soon found its way into the hands of Doug Langdale and Audu Paden, who hired him as composer for the animated series, Project G.e.e.K.e.R. in 1995. Career Patterson was the score composer and songwriter for three seasons on the Emmy Award-winning series Robot Chicken and series score composer for the award- winning TV series, El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera, directed by The Book of Life‚Äôs Jorge R. Gutierrez. Patterson is also the score composer and songwriter on DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs The Adventures of Puss in Boots, a Netflix original series about the character Puss from the Shrek franchise. He has worked alongside a variety of directors in his career including Chris McKay, Henry Selick, Tom McGrath, Conrad Vernon, Phil Lord and Chris Miller. Patterson has also written and produced a number of songs for artists including Seth MacFarlane, Zac Efron, 50 Cent, Matthew Morrison, RZA, Ke$ha, Patrick Stump, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith and many more. Patterson himself guest starred as a pubescent Theodore in the Robot Chicken episode \\"Crushed by a Steamroller on My 53rd Birthday\\" on [adult swim] and as Sid in a 1995 episode of Ren and Stimpy on Nickelodeon.

The PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch ports released in May 2020. It is the third game of their loosely connected Endless series, which includes Endless Space and Endless Legend. In the game, the player takes the role of the survivors of a prison spaceship, its escape pod having crashed to the surface of a strange planet. To escape, they must take an energy crystal through several floors, each floor filled with a number of dangerous creatures. To help, the player can have their survivors explore the randomly generated levels to collect resources as to enable power to various rooms and construct turrets to fend off the enemies when they move the crystal from its starting point to the elevator to the next floor. Gameplay Dungeon of the Endless is a roguelike game, featuring procedurally generated levels and the notion of permadeath, so that each runthrough of the game is different. The game is based on directing the survivors of a prison spacecraft (crew, prisoners, and civilians alike), having crash-landed on a strange alien planet, through several levels as to achieve escape from the planet. At the start of each game, the player selects two characters with each character having different statistics such as health, attack, defense power, and movement speed, as well as a number of abilities. The player is able to control each character separately or in tandem by directing them to move to the various rooms on the current level or open doors on that level, as well as to initiate any special ability or to heal them. Otherwise, the characters will act autonomously such as fending off any enemies that enter the room to the best of their ability. On the first level of the game, the characters will start in the crashed escape pod with the power crystal, while on subsequent levels, they will start on the elevator that they took from the previous level. The game plays out in primarily a turn-based manner, each turn marked when a new door on the level is opened. At the start of each turn, the player gains fixed amounts of three resources: Industry, Science, and Food. Industry is used primarily in the construction of turrets and resource generators; Science is used to research new types of turrets and generators, and Food is used to heal the characters, or increase their experience level which improves their statistics, and gives them new abilities. Certain rooms may have objects that can be scavenged for more of these resources. Furthermore, rooms will have Dust, which powers the crystal. As the crystal gains more power, the player can \\"activate\\" a limited number of continuous sets of rooms, allowing them to build resource generators and turrets on rooms which have been activated. Players can also deactivate a room at any time to reroute the power to a different room, disabling the turrets and generators in that room. Other rooms may feature item chests, shopkeepers, and research stations, or they may contain survivors that players can recruit to their party (up to 4 characters total). Opening a new door may also cause monsters to appear, appearing at random rooms across the map in any room that is not activated or lacking its own power source. The monsters will attack both the party and the crystal; killing the creatures has a chance of creating more Dust to run the crystal. The characters will lose health with attacks and will die if it drops to zero, though once all newly spawned monsters are defeated, their health is fully restored. If the crystal is attacked, it will permanently lose Dust, and if this drops to zero, the crystal is destroyed and the game is over. During monster attacks, the player can freely move the characters around between open rooms to obtain the best tactical placement, such as fighting monsters alongside numerous turrets. Once any spawned monsters are defeated, the player can move characters about and build defenses freely until they opt to open the next door. Once the exit point on the level has been found, the player then must have one character collect the crystal and carry it slowly from the start to the exit point, while other characters protect the carrier from hordes of monsters that appear at this point. If the crystal carrier dies, the game is over, but if all surviving players make it to the room with the exit point, the player advances to the next level. The goal of the game is to complete 12 of these levels, each with more difficult monsters that appear, with at least one character carrying the crystal to the final exit point. A meta-game exists in that the player can unlock additional characters for starting the game by recruiting new characters they find on levels and either completing the game or three levels with that character alive. Additionally, by achieving certain goals, the player can unlock different gameplay modes, such as one where the characters will start off much stronger than the enemies but will not regain health once a monster wave is defeated, forcing them to rely on food, healing turrets or items to heal. The game supports online play with up to four players. Each player controls one character, and each gains separate resources on the opening of new doors. New characters can be recruited by one player if there is space in the party, which are then controlled by that player. Development Dungeon of the Endless was developed by Amplitude Studios alongside the development of their expected-flagship title Endless Legend; the team for Dungeon was kept small to about four to five people, and used a simple pixel-based art style to keep the project simple. Amplitude's co-founder Romain de Waubert de Genlis stated that while they were developing a deep, high-quality 4X-based game in Endless Legend, the concept of Dungeon came from \\"some crazy drinking evening\\", and instead of trying to approach the smaller title with crowdfunding, sought additional funding to support the title. Dungeon of the Endless was first released as an Early access title on the Steam software store on December 11, 2013, and the full version was released on October 27, 2014. An iOS version was also developed and released on August 20, 2015. The title was released for the Xbox One on March 16, 2016. A PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch version was announced in 2019, and released on May 15, 2020. A free Team Fortress 2 based expansion was added in June 2015 for personal computers, adding in characters and items based on Team Fortress 2. An expansion called \\"Organic Matters\\" was also released on November 24, 2015, which included new playable characters, monsters, additional modules that can be built, a new endgame sequence, and support for controllers, and a separate content pack called \\"The Rescue Team\\" featuring three new playable-characters. Reception Dungeon of the Endless has received generally positive reviews, comparing the title to other hybrid roguelike such as FTL: Faster Than Light. Some have criticized the game for having low replay value, in that once you have succeeded to complete a runthrough of the game, you will likely have experienced all the hazards that the game presents, and while one can repeat the game with different characters to start, the experience will be mostly the same. The title was named as an honorable mention in the Excellence in Design category for the 2015 Independent Games Festival awards. It was also nominated for Strategy/Simulation Game of the Year and Outstanding Achievement in Game Design for the 18th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.

It claims to be politically independent and not aligned to, or intended to develop into a political party. However, the group refuses to state who funds them and generally refuses requests to speak with media about this. In 2019 it was reported the group has been funded in part by British American Tobacco. This, along with their close ties to many right-wing figures from the New Zealand political scene (see below), has resulted in them being widely regarded as a right-wing pressure group. Personnel The group is chaired by a former Television New Zealand political editor, John Bishop. The group's co-founder and Executive Director is Wellington constitutional lawyer, Jordan Williams. Williams is most known for fronting the 'Vote for Change' campaign during the 2011 referendum on New Zealand's voting system. Williams previously worked at the law firm of former ACT MP Stephen Franks. David Farrar co-founded the group and sits on its Board of Directors. Farrar continues to be heavily involved in the National Government's campaign activities, as its pollster and was described by Prime Minister John Key as \\"the best pollster in New Zealand\\" during his victory speech on election night 2011. Farrar describes himself as \\"very pro economic liberalism\\", and has stated that the Taxpayers' Union is not \\"anti left or right\\" and \\"I suspect we will somewhat annoy whoever is in government at the time\\". Activities The Taxpayers' Union initiatives include public relations campaigns and paid advertising. Campaigns are intended to generate media interest and greater public involvement and support for fiscally conservative causes. Its major campaigns have included reports on corporate welfare by the John Key-led government, commissioning independent costings of the election promises of all the major political parties during the 2014 election, and league tables comparing the performance of local government organisations. In January 2014, the group released internal ACC documents suggesting that $19 million awarded to the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions and Business New Zealand had been wasted. Soon afterward the scheme was scrapped. In June 2014 the group partnered with Fairfax Media to produce local government league tables, labeled \\"The Ratepayers' Report\\". The group also operates a confidential 'tip line' for members of the public and government officials to report examples of government waste. Controversies Use of false identities In October 2018, The New Zealand Herald revealed the results of an investigation into the Taxpayers' Union, showing that staff members acting on behalf of the organisation (and in an organised campaign) assumed false identities to lodge Official Information Act requests with the New Zealand Government's science research agency. After refusing to comment for two days, representatives from the Union admitted they had used false identities in this way. The Herald investigation found that all of the email accounts used for the requests were linked to one particular email address of a Taxpayers' Union staff member by way of account recovery processes.

Life Joost Berman was born in Ouwerkerk as the son of Maarten Berman (1769‚Äì1832) en Geertruida der Weduwen (1772?‚Äì1844). Along with some contemporaries from an evolving rural farming elite, he managed to complete his studies at the French and Latin schools. When he went on to study law at Leiden University (1814‚Äì1817), he was the first of these farmer boys to acquire higher education. After graduating, Joost Berman worked as an attorney in Zierikzee. Subsequently he was employed by the local court, serving as Assistant Clerk to the Court, Clerk to the Court, Judge of Peace, and from 1838 as Canton Judge. In 1843 Jacobus Boeije succeeded Berman as Canton Judge and Berman served again as Clerk to the Court until 1851. Joost Berman wrote several works of poetry mobilizing public opinion against the Belgian Revolution, supporting a continued Dutch rule over Belgium. His dissertation and some other nonfiction works were also published. Berman often wrote for magazines. From 1836 to 1847, Berman was co-editor of the \\"Zeeland People's Almanac\\" (Dutch: Zeeuwsche Volks-Almanak), alongside Rev. H.M.C. van Oosterzee. While meticulously covering all of Zeeland, both editors lived in Zierikzee, putting Schouwen slightly more central in the Almanac than customary in Zeeland publications. In the elections of 26 September 1848 for the city council of Zierikzee, Joost Berman received 75 votes, just one vote less than the last candidate to receive a 9 year appointment to the council. Berman and the two candidates behind him were selected to fill in places of deceased council members for a \\"short\\" term of 6 years. Personal and death  On 29 July 1817, Joost Berman married Neeltje Sevenhuizen (1797‚Äì1871) from Zierikzee. They had 12 children, 4 of whom died at a young age. In 1823, Berman was released from serving in the Zierikzee's civil guard for health reasons. Berman resigned from the Zierikzee court in 1851. There are indications of hardships around or after this decision. He died in Zierikzee on 18 March 1855, aged 62, after a disease his wife said lasted only 2 days. Joost Berman's son, Alexander Johan, studied at Joost's alma mater to become the Dutch Reformed minister of Watergang. His grandson, Simon Berman, was the mayor of six municipalities in the Netherlands, among which Schagen, Bedum, and Alblasserdam.

Leahy is one of only two players in league history to switch from the same clubs on three occasions, as he started his career at Geelong, went to South Melbourne, returned to Geelong, then finished up back at South Melbourne. Career Leahy, a ruckman from Cororooke, was first noticed by Footscray, which found him employment in Melbourne. Geelong however had a residential claim to him and it was with that club that he made five appearances in the 1939 VFL season. His performances that season were good enough for many to brand him as a future big name player. For personal reasons, Leahy didn't remain at Geelong in 1940 and over the next two years was approached by officials from Carlton, Essendon, Footscray and Richmond, but none were able to secure his services. Leahy, who Geelong had regarded highly enough to call him \\"a second Jack Dyer\\", was signed by South Melbourne in 1942, on loan from Geelong, which were sitting out of the competition due to the war. He was unable to play for South Melbourne at that time as the hours he worked at a munitions factory wouldn't allow for training, but he appeared in 11 games for the club in 1943. When Geelong returned to the league in 1944, South Melbourne were forced to return Leahy to Geelong, although he was reluctant to play for the club again, due to past differences and the fact that he had just bought a house in Kew. An agreement was reached that Leahy could train in Footscray, so he spent the 1944 season with Geelong and played 15 league games. He managed to get a clearance back to South Melbourne in 1945 and made his return in round seven, against Fitzroy.

On one of the seals found in Harrappa there are the figures of seven girls with long hair. These are believed to be Seetla Mata and her six sisters. Sisters Seetla Mata is sometimes depicted as having six sisters, and at other times as the eldest of eight sisters,http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal_11_2/4_bhatti_michon.pdf all of whom cause pustular diseases and are venerated for recovery. The sisters are: Masani, Basanti, Maha mai, Polamde, Lamkaria and Agwani. There shrines cluster around the central shrine of Seetla Mata. One of them is called Paharwali or of the mountain.

Worship Seetla Mata may be worshiped at any time of the year. However, the annual period of worship is the Punjabi month of Chait (March‚ÄìApril) as per the Punjabi calendar. Generally, she is worshiped early in the mornings of Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. The month of Chait is important in Punjabi culture as it is the last month of the Punjabi calendar and is the season in which wheat ripens. Also, the season is of Basant (spring). One of Seetla Mata's name is Basanti and therefore, she represents the negative side of Basant and is therefore worshiped. Trees Seetla Mata and her sisters reside on the trees of the neem (Azdiracta indica), kikar (Acacia arabica) or jand (Prosopis specigera). Shrine The shrines are situated on the banks of ponds. The shrine itself are made of some bricks and have no regular priests. The most important shrines at which large annual fairs are held are at the shrines of Seel village in Patiala and at the shrine of Jarg http://www.bharatonline.com/punjab/fairs/jarag-fair.html village in Ludhiana district. Fairs Jarag fair is one of the important fairs of Punjab that is held in Jarg, a village in tehsil Pail and district Ludhiana. The fair is also known as Baheria Fair. It is organised in the month of Cheth (March‚ÄìApril), in the honor of the Seetla Mata. On the day of the fair, the devotees of Seetla Mata gather near the pond and scoop a portion of the earth to form a mound. The mound is revered as the shrine of the Goddess. Prayers and pujas are conducted at the Jarg Fair. Sweet gulgula (jaggery cakes) are made one day prior to the fair and offered to the Goddess on the day of fair. The sweets are then offered to the donkeys, which are the favorite of the Goddess. Donkeys are specially decorated for the occasion, with potters cladding them in attractive colorful blankets. Some even put bells or conch shells and beads around their neck. Temporary stalls are set up and the fair hosts cultural programmes.

Folk form of Seetla Mata and Shitala in Hinduism Seetla Mata has been integrated into Hinduism. However, her birth is explained in a different manner to the legends prevalent in the Punjab. In Hinduism, she is known as Shitala and is not one of seven sisters. Shitala is accompanied by Jvarasura, the fever demon, Oladevi, the cholera goddess, Ghentu-debata, the god of skin diseases, Raktabati, the goddess of blood infections and the sixty-four epidemics. Shitala is represented as a young maiden crowned with a winnowing-fan, riding an ass, holding a short broom (either to spread or dust off germs) and a pot full of pulses (the viruses) or cold water (a healing tool).

Family and origins  The son of Husam Beg, Farhad Khan was descended from Bayram Beg Qaramanlu, a prominent nobleman, who served under the founder of the Safavid dynasty, king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501‚Äì1524). Farhad Khan had a brother named Zu'l Fiqar Qaramanlu, who would later accompany him in many of his expeditions.  Biography   Flight and rise  Farhad Khan was originally a servant of the Safavid prince Hamza Mirza, who was the son of shah Mohammad Khodabanda and one of the many pretenders to the Safavid throne during the civil war in Iran which had started with the death of shah Tahmasp I in 1576. However, Hamza Mirza was eventually murdered in 1586, while Farhad Khan fled to Ottoman territory due to the jealousy of many nobles, whom Farhad Khan feared that they would kill him. When Mohammad Khodabanda's son Abbas I ascended the throne in 1588, Farhad Khan returned to Iran. Farhad Khan then a loyal servant of Abbas I and quickly rose to high offices. In 1589/90, Farhad Khan was given the task of having the grand vizier Mirza Mohammad Munshi arrested and executed, which he successfully did. He then received the honorific title of \\"Rokn al-Saltana\\", and speedily became one of the kings favorites. Farhad Khan played an essential role in Abbas I's \\"reconquest\\" of Iranian territory. In 1589/90, Yuli Beg, who was the governor of the Safavid capital of Isfahan and had rebelled, surrendered to Farhad Khan. One year later, Farhad Khan, along with Hatem Beg Ordubadi, campaigned in Kerman against the uncontrollable Afshar leader, Yusuf Khan.  Invasion of Gilan, southern Iran, and Mazandaran  Map of northern Iran. In 1592/3 Farhad Khan and his brother led a punitive expedition to Bia Pish (eastern Gilan) against its rebellious vassal, the Kia'i ruler Khan Ahmad Khan. After a successful expedition, Farhad Khan was appointed as the governor of Azerbaijan in 1593 and the warden of the shrine of Ardabil. However, a rebellion shortly occurred in Bia Pish once again, which forced Farhad Khan to invade the province for the second time. By 1593, the rebellion had been suppressed, and Farhad Khan was appointed as the governor of Bia Pish. Still not satisfied with the amount of his control over the Gilan region, Abbas ordered Farhad Khan to invade Bia Pas (western Gilan). After having executed all the local rulers of the region, Farhad Khan went back to Bia Pish, while a certain Ali Khan was appointed as the governor of Bia Pas. Around this period, Farhad Khan was appointed as the commander-in- chief of the empire. In 1594, Ali Khan revolted, which forced Farhad Khan to invade Gilan for the third time. After the revolt was suppressed, the Rumlu chieftain Darvish Mohammad Khan was appointed as the governor of all of Gilan, while Farhad Khan was appointed as the governor of the rich province of Fars. Some time later, Farhad Khan and the Safavid grand vizier Hatem Beg Ordubadi campaigned in Khuzestan and Kohgiluyeh. In 1595/6, Farhad Khan incorporated Damghan, Semnan, and several districts of Khorasan to his domains. In the same year, he was replaced by prominent military officer Allahverdi Khan as the governor of Fars, but was instead given the governorship of Bia Pas. According to the chief court astrologer, Jalal al-Din Yazdi, at around the same time Abbas requested a daughter from the Georgian Amilakhori family, one of the most influential noble families in the subordinate Kingdom of Kartli. Farhad Khan, with the assistance of Prince Bagrat Khan, arranged the match. In 1596, Farhad Khan was appointed as the governor of Mazandaran. However, the province was still ruled by various vassal rulers, whom Farhad Khan took action against; before the upcoming year, Farhad Khan had seized Hezarjarib and after a two-month siege, captured the capital of the province, Amol, killing its local ruler Sayyid Muzaffar. After having successfully subjugated Mazandaran, Farhad Khan left the province under the control of one of his other brothers, Alvand Sultan. However, the Paduspanid ruler Bahman of Larijan shortly rebelled against the latter, but was defeated by Farhad Khan, who seized Larijan, Nur and Kojur. Farhad Khan then advanced to Savadkuh, which he had by 1597 captured, thus subduing all of Mazandaran.  Last expedition and death  In 1598, Farhad Khan was given the governorship of Astarabad (Gorgan). During the same year, he seized Mashhad from the Uzbeks and then along with Abbas and Allahverdi Khan, fought against a Uzbek army near Herat. According to the English traveler Robert Shirley, during the battle, Farhad Khan betrayed the Safavid army by informing the Uzbeks about how they should attack. However, according to Don Juan, Jalal al-Din Monajjem Yazdi, and Jonabadi, Farhad Khan had fled during the battle, which resulted that Abbas had him executed due to his cowardice. According to Iskandar Beg Munshi, Farhad Khan fled from the battle after being wounded, but was later accused of fleeing due to his cowardice. He was nevertheless forgiven by Abbas, who wanted to appoint him as the governor of Herat, which Farhad Khan refused. According to Oruch Beg, the refusal of Farhad Khan made Abbas feel that he had been insulted. Iskandar Beg further adds that due to the arrogant behavior of Farhad Khan and his suspected treason, which had made him become a threat to Abbas, who already did not have much trust to the Qizilbash‚Äîmade Abbas have him executed. After Farhad Khan's death, Gilan and Mazandaran were converted into the crown domain (khasseh), while Allahverdi Khan became the new commander-in-chief of the army.

He is believed that he was born in Antwerp. Here is registered as a pupil of the obscure painter Adriaen Willenhoudt from 1644. He is assumed to have worked in the Antwerp workshop of the prominent still life and animal painter Jan Fijt as Hermans' hand has been identified in a collaborative painting of Fijt.\\"\\"Still Life with Fruit, Hunting Trophies, a Parrot, a Cat and a Dog\\"\\" at Hoogsteder & Hoogsteder River scene with ducks and geese being attacked by hawks He travelled to Italy where he was recorded in Rome in the period from 1657 to 1665 and was known as 'Mons√∫ Aurora'. He enjoyed high-level patronage in Rome as is demonstrated by the commission to decorate the Roman palace of Camillo Francesco Maria Pamphili.Natura viva, Coppia di dipinti ad olio su tela attribuiti a Joannes Hermans at the Associaz Cultur. Antonello Governale He painted a large canvas and 38 smaller compositions depicting both dead and living animals, some set in marshy landscapes.Mark MacDonnell, Joannes Hermans, called Mons√π Aurora, Jays on a ledge at Dorotheum These formed part of a set of about 50 paintings with this theme, that Pamphili had commissioned, for educational as well as decorative purposes. Hermans also enjoyed the patronage of the Corsini, Colonna and Imperiali families as is shown by the presence of his works in contemporary Roman inventories. His compositions were also admired by the Flemish animalier David de Coninck and the Italian still life painter Pietro Navarra, both of whom worked in Rome during the second half of the 17th century. He returned to Antwerp in 1665 and became a master of the local Guild of Saint Luke. It is not clear when or where he died but it was likely in or after 1665 and before 1687. Work Joannes Hermans painted animals, game pieces and still lifes of flowers and fruit. From his Antwerp period only one signed painting is known. Still life around a bust of Ceres It is only through the research of Eduard A. Safarik and other scholars in the 1970s that the artist known in Italy as 'Mons√π Aurora' was identified with Joannes Hermans. Their conclusions were confirmed by the presence of the monogram \\"JHF\\" (Joannes Hermans Fecit) on one of the paintings in the Pamphili Palace attributed to Mons√π Aurora. Through the attribution of further works to him, his stature among 17th century still life painters has steadily risen. His grandiose still lifes combining human figures, flowers and fruit anticipate the arrival in Rome in 1653 of Abraham Brueghel who created large-scale Baroque compositions of flowers, fruit and animals. An example of such a large-scale composition by Hermans is the Still life around a bust of Ceres of 1653 (Sold at Cambi Casa d'Aste on 15 March 2011 in Genoa, lot 1452).Still life around a bust of Ceres of 1653 at Cambi Casa d'Aste These compositions with their cool, distanced objectivity celebrate the colourful hues of the birds' feathers, creating a \\"surreal\\" ambiance. Still Life with Fruit, Hunting Trophies, a Parrot, a Cat and a Dog In this compositions Hermans reveals the debt he owed to the works of the leading Flemish animal and game piece painter Jan Fyt. The series of bird etchings by Pieter Boel, another Flemish animal painter who stayed in Rome prior to 1650 also appear to have been an inspiration for his work. He must also have known the work of Nicasius Bernaerts, known in Italy under the pseudonym Mons√π Nicasio. Hermans also created garland paintings. Garland paintings are a special type of still life developed in Antwerp by artists such as Jan Brueghel the Elder, Hendrick van Balen, Frans Francken the Younger, Peter Paul Rubens and Daniel Seghers. They typically show a flower garland around a devotional image or portrait. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter.Ursula H√§rting, Review of Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional ImageHuguette Vanagt, Dani√´l Seghers - Guirlande met de Heilige Theresia van Avila at Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen Two garland paintings by Hermans, depicting flower garlands around respectively a boy and a girl, are in private collections.Ritratto di fanciulla entro ghirlanda at Cultura Italia Ritratto di fanciullo entro ghirlanda at Cultura Italia Hermans is known to have collaborated with other artists. A Still Life with Fruit, Hunting Trophies, a Parrot, a Cat and a Dog is a collaboration with the Flemish animalier Jan Fyt. In this painting each artist was responsible for different parts. The overall composition was done by Fijt, who also painted key parts of the composition, such as the dead hare, the partridges and the dog. The finishing of the painting was left to a studio assistant. While the assistant usually remained anonymous, in this composition he has been identified as Joannes Hermans. In Hermans' signed and dated Still life around a bust of Ceres from 1653 the same tufted parrot can be seen while the fruit is also rendered in an almost identical manner.

It was remade in 1940 as Father Is a Prince. Plot Herbert Kalness has worked hard to build up a successful plumbing supplies manufacturing company from nothing. His wife Elizabeth loves him dearly and is willing to put up with much. However, his grownup children, Alice and Junior, are put out by his constant complaining. Junior wants to go to college, but Herbert insists his son go to work for him in his business. Meanwhile, Alice has fallen in love with and wants to marry Andrew Goodrich, a Harvard graduate and lawyer (both qualities Herbert despises). When Elizabeth arranges a dinner to get acquainted with the future in-laws, Herbert proceeds to antagonize everyone. So she decides to give him a taste of his own medicine.

The other Commissioners were Peter Boxall AO, Tony Cole AO, Robert Fisher AM and Amanda Vanstone.The Commissioners NCOA The Terms of Reference for the Commission was to make recommendations to return the budget to a sustainable surplus of 1% of GDP by 2023/24.National Commission of Audit Releases Review of the Activities of the Commonwealth Government - Media Release The Commission was not asked to examine the revenue side of the budget, though it looked at some revenue issues. The Commission's report was the first full scale review of government expenditures for 18 years. Recommendations The Commission Report was titled Towards Responsible Government and published in two parts. Phase One Report, published in February 2014, dealt predominantly with improving the sustainability of finances, and Phase Two Report, published in March 2014, mostly addressed public sector performance and accountability as well as infrastructure.Report NCOA The Commission made 86 recommendations ‚Äì 64 in its Phase One Report and 22 recommendations in its Phase Two Report. Among the recommendations, the report recommended a slowing of the increases in the age pension to 28% of the average weekly earnings, an increase in the retirement age to 70 by 2035 and the inclusion of the family home in new means testing from 2027. These Commission's recommendations were adopted in the budget. The Commission also recommended changes to the bulk billing arrangements under Medicare, by the introduction of a compulsory copayment regime. The recommendation was accepted by the Abbott Government in the 2014 Australian federal budget, though the proposed budget measure deviated from the committee's recommendation in the copayment being linked to funding for a medical research fund. The budget measure has been widely criticised. The Commission found that the vertical and horizontal fiscal imbalance in Australia is a major impediment to growth and prosperity and recommended that the States have direct access to a portion of income tax generated in their economy and this be offset by a reduction in tied grants. It also recommended a pro rata distribution of GST with top ups to the supported States. The Commission reviewed and recommended rationalisation of many of the 900 Commonwealth bodies. Similarly on grants programs, it recommended far tighter controls and monitoring and assessment of outcomes. The Commission calculates that its recommendations would generate savings estimated at $60 to $70 billion per year within ten years, as well as a significant annual saving in interest arising from a reduction of debt. Cessation The National Commission of Audit ceased on 31 March 2014FAQs NCOA, six weeks before the release of the 2014 budget. Treasurer Joe Hockey, in response to the recommendations, quickly emphasised that the report was \\"not the budget\\", but did not rule out adopting any of the proposals.

Laoide was born at 7 Annaville Lower in Ranelagh, Dublin on 24 May 1865.Ciar√°n Bair√©ad, 'Se√≥samh Laoide', B√©aloideas, Vol. 15, No. 1/2 (Jun. - Dec., 1945), p. 127. He was the eldest son of an Irish Protestant couple, Joseph Henry Lloyd PhD and Anne Phair. His father was a linguist, member of the Irish Language Preservation Society/Chumann Buanchoime√°dta na Gaeilge, and friend of the Irish scholar P.W. Joyce. Laoide was awarded sizarships to attend Trinity College, Dublin in 1890 where he studied under Professor James Goodman (1828-1896) who awarded him a prize each year until 1894 when he left without completing his degree. Grave of Irish scholar Seosamh Laoide (1865-1939), Deansgrange Cemetery, Co. Dublin. In the autumn of 1893 Laoide is recorded as joint treasurer of Conradh na Gaeilge, which had been founded on 31 July of that year. Around the same time he visited Peadar √ì Laoghaire to encourage him to begin writing. In these years Laoide developed an extensive knowledge of Irish dialects and became active in the then mass movement that was Conradh na Gaeilge most especially in publishing books and articles in Irish. When Scoil Ard-L√©inn na h√âireann was established by Kuno Meyer in 1903 Laoide was one of the first students and became a prolific publisher of books in Irish on folklore, dialects, placenames and the like. Sometime after 1915 Laoide left Ireland and became a civil servant in London. While there he suffered mental health issues and was hospitalised for some time. He also married a wealthy Irish woman named Elizabeth Sharp. They returned to Ireland in 1920, where they settled in Stillorgan, Co. Dublin. In 1933 they moved to D√∫n Laoghaire. Laoide died on 21 September 1939 and, following a small private ceremony, was buried in Deansgrange, Co. Dublin. Under the heading 'Distinguished Gael laid to rest\\" The Irish Press of Monday 25 September 1939 recorded his death thus:'The funeral of Mr. Joseph Henry Lloyd (Seosamh Laoide), Royal Terrace West, D√∫n Laoghaire, took place to Deansgrange Cemetery, on Saturday morning, where the Service was conducted by the Rev. A. W. R. Camier, M.A., Christ Church.... Mr. Lloyd, who was a distinguished Irish scholar, was, with the President Dr. Douglas Hyde, one of the founders of the Gaelic League....

Named by N.B. Davis in 1918, the formation is characterized by white kaolinitic clay and is a source of high-quality refractory clay.Lerbekmo, J.F. 1985. Magnetostratigraphic and biostratigraphic correlations of Maastrichtian to early Paleocene strata between south-central Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan.

The Frenchman Formation of the eastern Cypress Hills, Saskatchewan. Geological Society of America Bulletin, vol. 6a, p. 413-420. Although fossils are generally lacking in the Whitemud Formation, in southern Saskatchewan the Whitemud contains coprolites (fossilized feces) and fossilized intestines of fish. Lithology In most areas the formation can be subdivided into three units: * Lower: Medium-grained arkosic and kaolinitic sandstones with trough cross-bedding. * Middle: Brown fissile carbonaceous shales and siltstones, with thin lignite beds. * Upper: Clays and siltstones, with some thinner, tabular units of simple and planar cross-bedded kaolinitic sandstones.Glass, D.J. (editor) 1997. Lexicon of Canadian Stratigraphy, vol. 4, Western Canada including eastern British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba. Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists, Calgary, 1423 p. on CD- ROM. . In southwestern Alberta around the Red Deer and Oldman Rivers, the middle carbonaceous shale unit is absent and the formation consists of white- weathering, cross-bedded kaolinitic sandstones interbedded with white- to cream-weathering silty and sandy clay. Environment of Deposition Sedimentology and fossils indicate that the Whitemud sediments accumulated in river channels, low-gradient streams, and shallow lakes and ponds on a low- lying coastal plain. Its kaolinite was produced by intense chemical weathering that altered the original feldspar content to kaolinite during and after deposition. Economic resources Kaolinite-rich clays have been quarried from the Whitemud Formation since before 1920 and are used in the manufacture of stoneware products ranging from pottery to sewer pipes.Lindoe, L.O. 1965. Ceramic clays of the Cypress Hills. Alberta Society of Petroleum Geologists, 15th Annual Field Trip Guidebook, Part 1, Cypress Hills plateau, p. 210-225. Paleontology Coprolite from the Whitemud Formation in southern Saskatchewan. Plant fossils and palynomorphs found in the carbonaceous shales indicate the presence of aquatic plants such as water lilies, as well as trees and shrubs related to figs, hickories and redwoods. Coprolites provide the only evidence of vertebrates. In southern Saskatchewan the formation contains scattered coprolites that represent feces of fish, most probably sturgeons. The feces have been preserved due to the replacement of the original fecal material by goethite, siderite and other iron minerals. They typically range in length from about 2 to 10 cm (1 to 4 in), although specimens as long as 23 cm (9 in) have been reported. A variety of coiled and uncoiled morphologies have been described, and some spiral forms with intricate systems of internal folds are thought to represent fossilized intestines containing feces that were unexpelled when the fishes died.Broughton, P.L., Simpson, F. and Whittaker, S.H. 1977.

Its principal innovation was a prefabricated antenna which arrived with elements folded, not disassembled, so that the antenna may be quickly unfolded during installation with the elements automatically locking into place. This saved time and effort for rooftop antenna installers, who were often working at awkward heights and in difficult weather. Established with $7000 in capital from cabbage farmer Louis Resnick, who sold his Ellenville farm, the company was manufacturing $12 million of antennas annually by 1954 and had expanded its product line in the 1960s to include transistorized signal boosters along with antenna rotors. The Ellenville plant received aluminum ingots that were extruded to create parts for the antennas. Additionally, the company extruded lengths of aluminum tubing that was wholesaled to firms that utilized it in products such as webbed folding beach chairs. One such firm was Gersten Brothers of Brooklyn, NY. Joseph Y. Resnick was also a member of the US Congress. The Joseph Y. Resnick Airport in Ellenville is named in his honor.Jane Anderson. (2013). New Lights for Ellenville? - What the Feds' funding of Resnick Airport might mean. Shawangunk Journal, (8 August 2013). Avnet Corporation purchased Channel Master in 1967, moving its manufacturing facilities to a former Sylvania television factory in Smithfield, North Carolina. Avnet sold the company in 1998 at a $33 million profit. Channel Master filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 2 October 2003 after losing its largest client, EchoStar. Its Smithfield satellite dish factory, which formerly employed 1600 people, was turned over to Andrew Corporation as part of an $18 million purchase of Channel Master's equipment, inventory, and intellectual property. Products Channel Master's original product was a prefabricated television aerial with hinged elements which would unfold and snap into place; this patented design greatly reduced installation time as existing antenna designs at the time had to be bolted together from multiple pieces by rooftop installers. Later products included antenna rotors, amplified antennas and pocket transistor radios, and rebuilt cathode-ray tubes. After the sale to Avnet, the Channel Master name was used to import and distribute various electronic products, including home and car stereo equipment, turntables, cassette decks, 8-track players, quadraphonic audio, television receivers and scanner radios. In the 1980s, Channel Master was the only second source for General Instrument's Videocipher II module, a building block for satellite television receivers, under a licensing agreement for which Avnet paid GI a million dollars. The Channel Master 4251, a high- performance parabolic UHF television antenna, stood about seven feet in diameter. Channel Master also built distribution amplifiers for cable television, satellite dishes and satellite antenna accessories. Modern brand The Channel Master brand and trademarks are currently owned by a Delaware corporation which markets terrestrial television antennas and digital video recorders in Gilbert, Arizona. While the market for antennas has been diminished by widespread subscription television deployment in the post- network era, the Channel Master name remains in active use as a terrestrial television antenna brand, marketing IPTV and digital video recorder equipment to cord cutters seeking lower-cost HDTV.Official site  References  See also * DTVPal * Log-periodic antenna Category:Electronics companies of the United States Category:1949 establishments in New York (state) Category:2003 disestablishments in North Carolina ","title":"Channel Master"},{"id":"44927713","text":"Paris Anthony Sadonis (born May 6, 1972) is a Los Angeles-based keyboardist, painter, performance artist and musician.https://www.discogs.com/artist/2464143-Paris-Sadonis  History  Best known for his work alongside Rozz Williams, Eva Ortiz and Jill Emery with deathrock band Shadow Project.

Some reviews have found that regular convection ovens or convection toaster ovens produce equally good results.\\"The Best Air Fryer Is a Convection Toaster Oven\\", The Wirecutter, The New York Times September 27, 2019  Cooking  Interior of an air fryer Air fryers use a circulation of hot air to cook food that would otherwise be submerged in oil. The air fryer's cooking chamber radiates heat from a heating element near the food, and a fan circulates hot air. There is an air inlet on the top and an exhaust at the back that controls the temperature by releasing any excess hot air. The temperatures can go up to 230 ¬∞C (445 ¬∞F) depending on the model. Oil cannot be used inside the air fryer, as it could burn. Cooking times in the air fryer are typically reduced by 20% in comparison with traditional ovens, depending on the model, and the particular food. Traditional frying methods induce the Maillard effect at temperatures of between by completely submerging foods in hot oil, well above the boiling point of water.

Most air fryers have temperature and timer adjustments that allow more precise cooking. Food is cooked in a cooking basket that sits atop a drip tray. The basket and its contents must be periodically shaken to ensure even oil coverage. High-end models accomplish this by incorporating a food agitator that continuously shakes the food during the cooking process. However, most air fryers require the user to perform the task manually at periodic intervals. Convection ovens and air fryers are similar in the way they cook food, but air fryers are generally smaller in capacity than convection ovens and give off less heat. The taste and consistency of foods cooked using traditional fried methods compared with air fried techniques are not identical, because the larger quantity of oil used in traditional frying penetrates the foods (or the coating batter, if it is used) and adds its own flavor. With air fryers, if food is coated only in a wet batter without an external barrier of a dry coating like breadcrumbs that are pressed firmly to ensure adhesion, the air fryer's fan can blow the batter off the food. Some air fryers are equipped with additional accessories for specific kinds of cooking, such as pizza pans, skewer racks, grilling trays, and cake barrels.  History  Convection ovens have been in wide use since 1945. In 2010, Philips introduced the Airfryer brand of convection oven, a new kitchen appliance at the Internationale Funkausstellung (IFA), a consumer electronics fair in Berlin. It was developed using the patented Rapid Air technology. Early air fryers were barrel-shaped. More recently, many have come to resemble toaster ovens and pressure cookers, and share their functions. According to Consumer Reports in 2019, the five top brands of air fryers in the USA were Elite, Farberware, GoWISE, Ninja, and NuWave.

Playing career Born in San Fernando, C√°diz, Andalusia, Monchi graduated from Sevilla FC's youth system. He made his senior debut with the reserves in the 1988‚Äì89 season, in Segunda Divisi√≥n B. In the summer of 1990, Monchi was promoted to the main squad in La Liga. He first appeared in the competition on 13 January 1991, starting in a 1‚Äì1 away draw against Real Sociedad. Monchi spent the vast majority of his career as a backup to Juan Carlos Unzu√©, only featuring more regularly from 1995 onwards. He played a career-best 26 matches in 1996‚Äì97, in a campaign that ended in relegation. Monchi retired in 1999 aged only 30, after contributing with 20 games ‚Äì playoffs included ‚Äì to his team's promotion. Sporting director In 2000, after Sevilla were relegated from the top division, Monchi was appointed their director of football. He was given two objectives by the board: develop the club's youth system and implement a vast scouting policy inside and outside Spain. Monchi helped discover Diego Capel, Alberto Moreno, Jes√∫s Navas, Antonio Puerta, Sergio Ramos and Jos√© Antonio Reyes, and he also created a network of over 700 scouts around the world. Within this setup, he sourced a number of profitable bargains (including Adriano, Dani Alves, J√∫lio Baptista, Federico Fazio, Seydou Keita and Ivan Rakitiƒá), making a profit of around ‚Ç¨200 million in the transfer market, as the club established itself in the top half of the top division in his 16 years there. Monchi asked to leave Sevilla in the 2016 off-season, but the board did not accept his request unless he paid his ‚Ç¨5 million buyout clause. He left in April 2017, having helped win 11 trophies during his tenure. Later that month, he signed a four- year contract in the same role with A.S. Roma in Italy's Serie A. On 17 March 2019, Monchi confirmed that he would be returning to Sevilla as sporting director the following month.

It is considered a pendant portrait to the Portrait of Paulus van Beresteyn, in the same museum.  Painting  Similar to Hals' Portrait of a Woman Standing in Chatsworth House, this woman is wearing a wedding ring on her right forefinger, a figure-eight collar and lace wrist collars with gold bracelets. Her bodice is a richly embroidered Dutch wedding stomacher, and a heavy gold chain draped through a vlieger, rests on a wheel-shaped fardegalijn. Her diadem cap lacks wings and is more similar to the cap worn by Hals's unknown sitter Portrait of a Woman Standing (Kassel) and by his brewer Aletta Hannemans. Her portrait was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote: \\"155. CATHARINA BOTH VAN DER EEM, wife of Paulus Beresteyn. B. 10 ; M. 16. Three-quarter-length, life size.

He was a Major General of the Russian Empire and First Republic of Armenia during World War I, and later became the Ambassador of Armenia to England. Early life Jaques Bagratuni was born on 25 August 1879 in Akhaltsikhe, Russian Empire to a noble family. His family is descended from the Bagratuni dynasty of former kings of Armenia in the Middle Ages. He graduated from the Tiflis gymnasium in 1898 with honors, from the Kiev Military School in 1900, and from the Nicholas General Staff Academy in 1907. Military career Bagratuni served as an officer in Warsaw and successfully completed an important task in the intelligence of Persia. He became a lieutenant in 1904 and that same year he entered the Academy of the General Staff, but in early 1905 his teaching was interrupted and he went to the front of the Russian-Japanese War. Bagratuni commanded a company in the 19th East Siberian shelf. On 25 February 1905 in a battle near the village of Pooh, he was shot and wounded, but continued to command a company. For military merit he was awarded the Order of St. Anna 4th class with the inscription \\"For Bravery\\" and the Order of Saint Stanislaus 3rd class with Swords. On 26 November 1908, he became Captain and Assistant Adjutant Senior Staff of the Turkestan Military District. Bagratuni then led the 4th Intelligence Department of the district headquarters. According to his biographer, Academician Hrant Avetisyan, Bagratouni carried out secret military research and practical tasks in Mongolia, Tibet, Korea, Afghanistan, and Central Asia in Bukhara, Kashgar, Kermishe, Kushka, Merv. He uncovered a plot of Pan-Turkic emissaries in Tashkent and other cities of Turkestan. This feat was marked by his awarding the Order of St. Anna 3rd degree and he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. Also for his services rendered, the Emir of Bukhara celebrated by granting him the Order of the Golden Star of Bukhara 3rd class. First World War At the beginning of the First World War, Bagratuni was a staff officer for assignments at the headquarters of the 1st Army Corps of Turkestan. In September 1914, he distinguished himself in battle in the Western Front in the area of Luka, for which he was awarded the Order of Saint Stanislaus 2nd class with Swords and Order of St. Vladimir 4th class with Swords. From October 1914 to January 1915, temporarily filled the post of Chief of Staff of the 1st Army Corps of Turkestan, and from January 1915 to November 1916 he was the Chief of Staff of the 76th Infantry Division, 2nd Turkestan Infantry Brigade, and 2nd Turkestan Infantry Artillery Brigade. Bagratuni was given the rank of colonel on 6 December 1915, and for making the differences in the battles he awarded the Order of St. Vladimir 3rd class with Swords, Order of St. Anna 2nd class with Swords, and Order of St. George 4th class. On 22 November 1916, he became the commander of the 8th Turkestan Infantry Regiment. Activities in 1917 After the February Revolution, he was one of the supporters of democratic reforms in the army. He was elected a delegate to the All-Russian Congress of officers in Petrograd in May 1917 and since June 1917 he served in the office of the Minister of War of the Russian Provisional Government of Alexander Kerensky, his brother-in-law. Bagratuni became the Chief of Staff of the Petrograd Military District on 12 July 1917 and was promoted to major general on 30 August 1917. He was one of the organizers of the creation of the Armenian military units in the Russian army. In August 1917, together with the continuation of his service in the post of Chief of Staff Military District, he was elected Armenian military commissioner and chairman of the Armenian military council, and actively engaged in the formation of the Armenian volunteer units. On the eve of the coming to power of the Bolsheviks to take measures against troops loyal to the Provisional Government, the headquarters of the Northern Front ordered to send a special military unit to Petrograd. However, the Front Command did not carry out the order. As a result, Bagratuni managed to collect only small military force. On 7 November 1917, the newly appointed Dictator of the Provisional Government Nikolai Kishkin received authority to restore order in the city. He immediately removed the hesitant Colonel Georgy Polkovnikov from his post as commander in chief of the Petrograd Military District and replaced him with a more energetic General Jaques Bagratuni. However, he could not reverse the negative development of the situation and the Bolsheviks soon overran the district headquarters. He resigned and was arrested by the Bolsheviks in the Winter Palace. Bagratuni was imprisoned in the fortress until he was released on 15 December 1917. The next day, he again assumed the office of the Armenian military commissar. Armenian general and diplomat General Jaques Bagratuni and General Andranik Ozanian Bagratuni continued to work on the formation of an army corps and sending troops to Armenia and the Caucasus from late 1917 to early 1918. He arrived in Baku on 7 March 1918 at the urging of revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin to assist the Centrocaspian Dictatorship, headed by Stepan Shahumyan. On the night of March 15, he survived an assassination attempt on the street by three Turkish agents, which led to the amputation of one of his legs. Despite the severe wound, he took part in the fighting during the March Days and in the defense against the Turkish and Tatar combined forces in the summer. In early autumn 1918, he was appointed by the Centrocaspian Dictatorship as Minister of War. On September 15 at 11:00, the British, without warning, withdrew their troops, exposing entire sections, leading to the fall of the city to the Islamic Army of the Caucasus in the Battle of Baku. Anticipating the turn of events, Bagratouni took of 1,500 troops with 8,000 refugees on 16 September 1918 and left for Persia to Anzali Port. On the same day the Turks broke in Baku, the massacre to thousands of Armenians took place during the September Days, the last major massacre of World War I.Andreopoulos, George (1997). Genocide: Conceptual and Historical Dimensions. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, , p. 236. Upon return of the British troops in Baku on 18 November, Bagratuni traveled back to the Armenian National Council. He was also keenly interested in the Armenian defense in Zangezur and Nagorno-Karabakh led by General Andranik Ozanian. A letter sent by Bagratuni to General Andranik, along with money to help defend against the invading Turks in Zangezur, dated 12 December 1918, states: \\"I send you one million rubles, of which 400,000 should be allocated to the military, and the remaining 600,000 for assistance to refugees - local and from distant places.\\" In 1919, he was part of the delegation of Armenia to the Paris Peace Conference as an adviser. He was part of an Armenian military mission in August 1919 aimed at the United States for talks on cooperation in the defense sector. The mission arrived in New York City in November 1919. Bagratouni met with many American politicians and public figures, spoke at rallies, and insisted on helping Armenia and the official recognition of the First Republic of Armenia. On 3 January 1920, Bagratuni received Robert Lansing, the US Secretary of State. The Secretary of State gave a memorandum in which it was stated that the Armenians, in the presence of weapons and uniforms, on their own would return the Armenian territory left to the Turks under the Armistice of Mudros. Despite the fact that Armenia had already set up embassies in several countries, Lansing explained the US authorities couldn't provide military assistance to countries that are not officially recognized. After completion of the mission, he returned to France in 1920 and was appointed Ambassador of the Republic of Armenia to Britain, where he remained in exile. Bagratuni died on 23 December 1943 in Lostwithiel in Cornwall. After a funeral at the Armenian Church in London on 3 January 1944, he was buried at Brompton Cemetery.The Times, 19 January 1944. Personal life Bagratuni was married to Anna Kerensky, the sister of Alexander Kerensky. They had met while Anna graduated from Tashkent women's gymnasium around the same time Bagratuni served in Tashkent.

It was built from to . It is also known as Cairns Terrace. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This former row of four, two-storeyed timber houses was erected in 1887-88 on newly subdivided land purchased by Joseph Cross, a printer or machinist in the Government Printing Office, in late 1886. He was resident at the terrace by 1888. The buildings were erected at the height of the 1880s economic boom. Possibly because of the Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885, which prevented individual row houses from being sold on separate titles, the Cross family occupied at least two of the houses originally, and what might otherwise have been built as cheap rental accommodation was larger in scale and more decorative in appearance than usual. Many other inner suburban multiple dwellings were built in timber during the 1880s, but most either were single-storeyed or semi-detached. Its construction reflected also the growing acceptance of timber and corrugated iron in more prestigious dwellings. Each house comprised six main rooms on four levels: front room and parlour at street level; two bedrooms on the first floor; an attic room; and a kitchen beneath the rear half of each house. The exterior walls were clad with chamferboards and the single gabled roof with corrugated iron, while the interior was lined with lath and plaster. The double verandahs with curved iron roofs to front and back were decorated with cast-iron fringes and balustrades and a decorative timber frieze to the front. Four semi-circular dormer windows with scalloped bargeboards faced the street. In the 1890s three of the four houses were known as Keira, Mascotte and Kiama. Cross retained possession of the houses until 1910, during which time white collar, craft and business persons were predominant occupants. After 1945 the building was converted into flats, with the verandahs boarded and louvered to provide modern kitchens and bathrooms. In the 1980s the buildings were renovated and converted into a single house.  Description  Cross Terrace is located on a ridge road in central Red Hill, and is visible from many Paddington vantage points to the south. It is set close to the street alignment at the front and is the most prominent dwelling in a street lined with traditional housing. It is a two-storeyed, timber framed and clad building with a gabled roof and double verandahs to front and back. Little remains of the original interior except the fireplaces. The ground floor has been converted into kitchen, dining, sitting, music and bathrooms and the first floor into bedrooms, around a wide open two-level gallery connected by a new central staircase. French doors opening to the front verandahs have been retained, but the plain stick balusters and frieze on the verandahs are recent, and the dormers have been removed. A double carport with twin gables is located in the centre front. Despite these changes the gabled, four level form remains intact, as well as the main openings and chimneystacks.  Heritage listing  Cross Terrace was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Cross Terrace is significant for its association with the closer settlement of the Red Hill area in the 1880s. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Cross Terrace is significant as the only known evidence of the late 19th century two-storeyed timber terrace house type to survive in Brisbane. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Cross Terrace is significant as a local landmark and for its contribution to the streetscape along Cairns Terrace.

Registration must be renewed every three years, for which 450 hours of registered practice and 35 hours of study must have been completed in the past three years. The total number of registered mental health nurses in the UK was 48,130 in 2010, however, since then there has been a slight decrease, as some nurses have transferred over to voluntary and independent providers.

It involves providing interventions in the form of psychotherapy or familial support; arranging other services when required; establishing networks with community agencies; overseeing changes in medication; community integration and actively seeking out people who drop out of services. * Psychosocial interventions: A holistic approach to patient care is required, by which the MHN should build rapport with patients to encourage trust, while listening to and interpreting their needs and concerns. If a patient is having social/financial problems, the MHN may offer advice and interventions e.g. by arranging social events in the community, in order to develop patients‚Äô socials skills and combat feelings of isolation. They may also work with patients' families and carers, helping to educate them about the burden of mental illness. * Physical health: Long-term mental illness sufferers may have substantial cardiometabolic/ respiratory illnesses.Allebeck P., (1989). Schizophrenia: a life- shortening disease. Schizophrenia Bulletin, 15, 81-89Richard IG Holt. Cardiovascular disease and diabetes in people with severe mental illness: causes, consequences and pragmatic management.

M. and Carmen E: AIDS risk in the chronically mentally ill: clinical strategies for prevention. New Directions for Mental Health Services, 48, 83-95, 1990 -9 The MHN will prepare and maintain comprehensive patient records, whilst also producing care plans and risk assessments. They must also monitor weight, blood pressure and provide health education and interventions in areas such as diet, smoking and sexual behaviour. * Medication management: MHN must ensure correct administration of medication, including injections, and monitoring the results of treatment. * Working with dual diagnosis patients, and promoting a 'recovery' based approach to care. * Behavioural therapy: Providing evidence- based individual therapy e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy for depression and anxiety. Empathising with distressed patients and applying ‚Äòde-escalation‚Äô techniques to help patients manage their emotions and behaviour better. Encourage patients to take part in therapeutic hobbies such as art or drama.

It was thought to be a M dwarf or K-type main-sequence star potentially from the Sun and possibly a companion of the brighter star HIP 85607,Optical companion HIP 85607 could be a K0III orange giant ~1200 light-years from the Sun based on a small parallax of 2.72mas. but they are now known to be an optical double. (HIP 85605 is 1,790 ¬± 30 light years away, and HIP 85607 is 1,323 ¬± 13 light years away) The original Hipparcos parallax measurement in 1997 was 202 mas, which would place it 16.1 light-years from the Solar System. In 2007, van Leeuwen revised the number to 147 mas, or 22.2 light-years. With a parallax of 147 mas (0.147 arcseconds), HIP 85605 is unlikely to be one of the 100 closest star systems to the Sun. In 2014, it was estimated that HIP 85605 could approach to about from the Sun within 240,000 to 470,000 years, assuming the then-known parallax and distance measurements to the object were correct. In that case its gravitational influence could have disrupted the orbits of comets in the Oort cloud and caused some of them to enter the inner Solar System. With the release of Gaia DR2, it was determined that HIP 85605 is actually a much more distant 1790 ¬± 30 light- years away, and as such will not be passing remotely close to the Sun at any point in time.

It has the amino acid sequence Tyr-Pro-Phe-Phe-NH2. It is a high affinity, highly selective agonist of the Œº-opioid receptor, and along with endomorphin-1 (EM-1), has been proposed to be the actual endogenous ligand of this receptor (that is, rather than the endorphins). Like EM-1, EM-2 produces analgesia in animals, but whereas EM-1 is more prevalent in the brain, EM-2 is more prevalent in the spinal cord. In addition, the action of EM-2 differs from that of EM-1 somewhat, because EM-2 additionally induces the release of dynorphin A and [Met]enkephalin in the spinal cord and brain by an unknown mechanism, which in turn go on to activate the Œ∫- and Œ¥-opioid receptors, respectively, and a portion of the analgesic effects of EM-2 is dependent on this action. Moreover, while EM-1 produces conditioned place preference, a measure of drug reward, EM-2 produces conditioned place aversion, an effect which is dynorphin A-dependent. Similarly to the case of EM-1, the gene encoding for EM-2 has not yet been identified.

Oblong: branch length less than 10 times width. Linear: branch length 10 or more times width to 4 cm long and 3‚Äì7 mm wide, mostly simple, wavy along acute margins and cortical ridges, occasionally with short rounded lobes, especially near apex, with longitudinal spiraling ridges that divide and unite generally at 45¬∞ to form angled margins and intermittent ridges, the longitudinal ridges connected by transverse ridges, similar to a spiraled ladder (or DNA helix), and by containing divaricatic acid, with triterepenes. Similar species are Niebla siphonoloba, distinguished by the lichen substance sekikaic acid and by transverse ridges branching between margins, Niebla podetiaforma, distinguished by reticulated vein-like cortical ridges between margins, Niebla contorta distinguished by the obtuse branch margins, and Niebla undulata that differs by having a smooth recessed cortical surface between ridges.

When the Convention reconvened for the election on May 2, 1924, at St. Paul's Church, Rochester, Ferris was the only nomination and was elected Bishop Coadjutor.

He had worked with Brent in establishing them,George Sherman Burrows, The Diocese of Western New York, 1897-1931 (Diocese of Western New York, 1935), 316. Ferris called a Special Convention of the Diocese for October 29, 1929. It was held at S. Paul's Cathedral, Buffalo, N. Y. The Convention's agenda was the electing of a Bishop Coadjutor. From the first vote the Rev. Cameron J. Davis led in the number of votes. However, he did not obtain a majority of both Orders until the fourth ballot. Davis was instituted as Bishop Coadjutor in 1930.George Sherman Burrows, The Diocese of Western New York, 1897-1931 (Diocese of Western New York, 1935), 318. When Ferris addressed the Diocesan Convention in 1930, he expressed his appreciation for Davis. He said that Davis had ‚Äúlifted many burdens‚Äù from his shoulders. Also, he reported that Davis was gaining the love of the diocese both as ‚Äúan able administrator‚Äù and as a pastor.George Sherman Burrows, The Diocese of Western New York, 1897-1931 (Diocese of Western New York, 1935), 318. The beginning of Ferris as Diocesan Bishop and Davis Bishop Coadjutor working work together coincided with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 which was followed by the long Great Depression. This depression ‚Äúoccasioned serious reduction of Diocesan income.‚Äù Programs, salaries, and other expenses had to be reduced each year.George Sherman Burrows, The Diocese of Western New York, 1897-1931 (Diocese of Western New York, 1935), 318. Ferris served as Diocesan Bishop of Western New York until its division in 1932. At that time he became Bishop of the Diocese of Rochester. He resigned in 1938. Description of Ferris George Sherman Burrows, the diocese's historian described Ferris: Ferris was primarily a pastor. He encouraged family religion and urged families to have an altar in their homes. He said that ‚Äúthe way to redeem society is through family religion.‚Äù Ferris was a leading advocate for ‚ÄúBible Teaching and Expository Preaching.‚Äù He said that he would prefer to be thought of ‚Äúas a teaching parson than a preaching parson.‚ÄùGeorge Sherman Burrows, The Diocese of Western New York, 1897-1931 (Diocese of Western New York, 1935), 322-323.

It was designed by John B Nicholson and built in by Thomas Game. It was extended in 1917 to a design by George Henry Male Addison. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Architectural drawing of the Normanby Hotel, circa 1890 This two-storeyed brick hotel was constructed in 1890 for Brisbane publican Elizabeth Sophia Burton, on land acquired by her husband in 1865. In 1872 the Burtons erected the first Normanby Hotel on the site, a modest two-storeyed building which fronted Kelvin Grove Road. It is likely that the hotel was named after the recently appointed Queensland Governor George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby. In 1889, the licensee William Valentine (son-in-law of the Burtons) decided to demolish the hotel to make way for the newer larger hotel facing Musgrave Road. Architect John Beauchamp Nicholson called tenders for the new Normanby Hotel in late 1889. The successful contractor was Thomas Game with a price of , including fittings. The new hotel was formally opened on Monday 1 December 1890 with a dinner for fifty men, most of them prominent citizens including James Drake and John Annear (both Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly). Alterations were made in 1917, to plans prepared by architect George Henry Male Addison. The Burton family owned the hotel until 1944, and were both licensees and occupants for much of that time. The Normanby Hotel has become a Brisbane landmark, and lends its name to the adjacent Normanby Fiveways, the intersection of five inner city arterial roads.  Description  The substantial, Queen Anne styled brick hotel stands in a prominent location on the northern ridge above Petrie Terrace, and dominates the vista at the Normanby Fiveways. It occupies a corner site and is two-storeyed to Musgrave Road and three to Kelvin Grove Road at the rear, where the land drops steeply. The building consists of a central rectangular block with two wings at the rear and projecting bays at the front. The whole is capped by an elaborately gabled roof of corrugated iron, with Tudor style timber detailing in the gable ends, cast-iron finials above, and decorative brick chimneys. The principal facades to the southwest and southeast are richly ornamented with cantilevered balconies beneath the gables, arcaded verandahs, and an oriel window which once overlooked the city. The Musgrave Road facade has been altered at street level, but the upper level remains intact. At the rear are two additions: an interwar single-storeyed masonry extension, and an unsympathetic modern brick bottle shop. Established shade trees to the southeast now obscure the city facade, and a terraced beer garden has been created beneath them. Internally the ground floor has been remodelled, but the upper floor remains substantially intact. Despite the alterations and painting of the face brickwork, the Normanby Hotel retains its picturesque quality.  Heritage listing  Normanby Hotel, 2016 Normanby Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Normanby Hotel at Red Hill, constructed in 1890 as the second Normanby Hotel on the site, is important in demonstrating the evolution of Petrie Terrace/Musgrave Road as a major arterial road in Brisbane's inner northwestern suburbs The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It demonstrates an early Brisbane use of Queen Anne stylistic elements in commercial design, and, along with the Norman Hotel at Buranda, is important as one of the few known examples of the commercial work of Brisbane architect JB Nicholson. The interwar bottleshop is significant as a substantially intact and increasingly rare example of its type. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.

Born in Luton, to parents from Glasgow, the son of a Vauxhall employee and a dressmaker. Raised in a house which was a \\"two up two down\\", he passed the 11-plus, and had a positive experience of attending a grammar school. Virtually blind in one eye, an operation at 14 on the day the National Health Service NHS was founded (5 July 1948) saved his eyesight. He began to work for a local paper after leaving school, the Luton Gazette. Briefly working for the nationals while still having the day job in Luton, he managed to gain a regular job at the Daily Sketch after finding details of the 21st birthday party of a son of the Aga Khan at the Savoy Hotel. Shand was later a journalist, working for the Daily Mail and Daily Express, before moving into comedy writing in the 1960s. Shortly after being sacked from the Mail for being drunk once too often, he ran into the documentary maker Michael Ingrams, who eventually introduced him to Bernard Braden, for whom Shand first began to write humorous material. Shand worked extensively with David Frost, beginning with The Frost Programme in 1967. Subsequent work with Frost included ITV's coverage of Apollo 11 landing on the Moon in 1969 and spells in New York working on Frost's American talk show as a \\"creative consultant\\". His work with impressionist Mike Yarwood began around the same time with the sketch show Three of a Kind (1967). Shand also wrote for such acts as Spike Milligan, Kenny Everett, Bob Monkhouse, The Two Ronnies and Jasper Carrott (on Carrott Confidential). He was a member of BBC staff for many years. Shand married Judith Keppel in 1985; the marriage ended in 1987. He died on 14 April 2018, aged 84 in Whitton, North Lincolnshire where he had lived since 2003.

Since 2006 it has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site ‚Äì Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape. The mine is within the Aire Point to Carrick Du Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and the South West Coast Path passes along the cliff. History The mine was commenced by John Boyns, in circa 1830 on earlier workings, with Wheal Boys first opened, and shortly after the Growse. Water was drained from old workings by a steam engine but little ore was found and it was some years before a proft was made. Driving eastwards, towards the Botallack Mine, the Cercendrey and Cargotha lodes were intersected and a large amount of tin was raised. Wheal Boys also eventually produced a large amount of tin. At one time the mine employed around 500 people and is over deep. At a general meeting of the shareholders on 8 March 1884 it was decided to close the older part of the mine and to carry on mining the cliff part of the mine. Over 100 tons of ore was processed each month but due to the low price of tin the mine was making a loss. On 10 January 1893 the miners broke through into the flooded workings of the neighbouring Wheal Drea. As water rushed into Wheal Owles the air blasted through the mine blowing out the lights and leaving the miners in darkness. Those working in the upper levels survived but nineteen men and a boy lost their lives. Their bodies were never recovered. \\"... a terrible roar was heard, followed by a rush of wind, which blew out all the lights. Knowing that something had gone wrong in the mine, the men made for the ladders, and soon found out it was a case of hurry and strain every nerve for life or death. In the dark they did their best to gain the surface, some at times being completely torn away from the ladders by the tremendous currents of water and wind.... In about an hour and a half that huge space was completely full.\\" Wheal Owles mine had been flooded by waters from Boscean mine which had broken into Wheal Drea. \\"The result is that the immense pool of water now stretched through, practically, three mines and is a mile-and-a-half in length - almost from the sea to beneath the Wesleyan Chapel at St Just Church-town.\\" The Cornishman, January 12 1893 References Category:Grade II listed buildings in Cornwall Category:St Just in Penwith Category:Tin mines in Cornwall ","title":"Wheal Owles"},{"id":"44928462","text":"Jil ( Lake) is a 2015 Indian Telugu-language action film directed by debutant Radha Krishna Kumar.

Plot The story starts off in Mumbai with don Chota Nayak (Kabir Duhan Singh) escaping from police custody. Once out, he looks out for his aide-turned-foe Ranganath (Brahmaji). Jai (Gopichand) is a fire officer who happens to help Ranganath, not knowing that the latter is Nayak's former right-hand man. He turns informer and runs away with Nayak's money. Nayak suspects Jai to be an accomplice of Ranganath and starts troubling him. This brings them to Hyderabad, where he meets Savithri (Rashi Khanna), and it is love at first sight for both of them. Just as their romance begins, Nayak traces Jai, and from then on, it is open war between them. Nayak threatens to kill whoever is close to Jay and keeps his word. He kills Jai's uncle (Chalapathi Rao) in a fire accident, after which Jai kills Nayak's brother (Amit Tiwari). Jai then sends his family far away to keep them safe, but Savithri, unaware of Nayak's presence, talks to him openly. Nayak then captures Savithri and threatens to kill her if Jai does not hand over the money. Jai comes to the realization as to where the money is and rifles through Ranganath's jacket, where he finds a book containing the bank account and password where the money is located. Jai calls Nayak, and they meet at a deserted market for the exchange, but it goes wrong when ACP A. Parasuram (Harish Uthaman) tries killing Nayak and Jai saves Nayak, much to the police officer's dismay. Meanwhile, Nayak gains access to the bank account and sees it empty, as all the money had been transferred to the dying Savithri's account. Nayak tries reviving Savithri in a building under construction. Jai arrives and sets fire to the building, after which there is a bloody and violent battle between Nayak and Jai.

History Designed to be the Democratic answer to the Union Club, its prominent members included Samuel J. Tilden, August Belmont, Grover Cleveland, Alfred E. Smith, Herbert H. Lehman, Jimmy Walker and Robert F. Wagner Other prominent members included Augustus Schell, Dean Richmond and John T. Hoffman. In 1885 it was listed as the residence of Robert Barnwell Roosevelt, the uncle of Theodore Roosevelt. The Manhattan Club was organized on September 25, 1865 at Delmonico's on 14th Street at Fifth Avenue. Its first home was the Benkard House at 96 Fifth Avenue near the corner of 15th Street (called \\"Old 96\\" by members), followed by the A.T. Stewart Mansion on 34th Street at Fifth Avenue. From 1899 to 1966, it occupied the Jerome Mansion, at which time the building was sold to a developer and subsequently was torn down. The Manhattan Club then moved to a suite of rooms at the Barclay Hotel previously occupied by the Cornell Club and thereafter functioned mainly as a luncheon club. Around 1979, its suites were converted into conference rooms and the Manhattan Club was closed. Ambiguous Democratic Party Legacy Despite having been conceived as a Democratic Party bastion during the U.S. Civil War, in its later days, the members of the Manhattan Club were often decidedly Republican in sympathies. In 1954, a survey of the men's social clubs of Manhattan noted that the club had become \\"ninety percent Republican.\\" A half-century earlier, the significant majority of members supported Republican William McKinley's bid for President of the United States, triggering letters of resignation from members who wanted it to be a Democratic Club. Invention of the Manhattan Cocktail A popular history suggests that the Manhattan cocktail originated at the club in the early 1870s, where it was invented by Dr. Iain Marshall for a banquet hosted by Jennie Jerome (Lady Randolph Churchill, Winston's mother) in honor of presidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden. The success of the banquet made the drink fashionable, later prompting several people to request the drink by referring to the name of the club where it originated‚Äî\\"the Manhattan cocktail\\".See Manhattan (cocktail) Painting by Childe Hassam  The Manhattan Club, 1891 painting by Childe Hassam The exterior of the club was featured in an 1891 painting by Childe Hassam when it was at the Stewart Mansion.

Opened in 1901 as the Portland Crematorium, it is the first and oldest crematorium west of the Mississippi River, and the largest privately-managed indoor burial site in the Pacific Northwest. Established due to a growing demand for crematory services in Portland at the turn of the 20th century, the establishment evolved to house a mausoleum as well, which consists of eight stories and over of hallways, featuring ornate stained glass and Italian sculptures. History Wilhelm's Portland Memorial Funeral Home was originally established as the Portland Crematorium on April 24, 1901, in response to the demand for crematory services in the Portland area. The Spanish Mission Revival-style mausoleum was built between 1900 and 1901, featuring whitewashed stucco walls, a tile roof, and mosaic tile doors. Frank Gibson, the secretary of the San Francisco Cremation Company, served as the first superintendent and manage of the crematory. At the time of its opening, charges for cremation were $45, and $25 for children under the age of twelve. Upon its opening, the Portland Railway, Light and Power Company operated a funeral car that could accommodate a casket as well as sitting benches for grieving family members. In subsequent decades, the crematorium expanded into a full-fledged mausoleum. Connected by vault-lined hallways, staircases, and elevators, the mausoleum faces the Willamette River and Oaks Bottom swamp, is eight stories in height, and contains over of hallways. The mausoleum features numerous marble fronts on crypts which originate from quarries in Italy, while a variety of statues and other religious sculptures throughout were made by the Italian Tavarelli Studios. One of the central statuaries in the mausoleum is a replica of Michelangelo's La Piet√†. Stained glass crafted by the Povey Brothers is incorporated throughout. The original crematorium building is the Rose Chamber, grouped with several rooms below it, also named after flowers: the Lily, Daisy, Tulip, and Carnation Rooms. Various wings throughout the mausoleum take their names from religious figures as well as U.S. presidents. Accessibility Wilhelm's Portland Memorial Funeral Home is open to the public.

It was built . It is also known as Berley Flats. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Warriston was built for David Pringle Milne, a Brisbane west ward alderman from 1870‚Äì76, retired boot and shoe importer/manufacturer, and proprietor of the Glasgow Boot and Shoe Mart in Queen Street. The semi- detached houses may have been named after Warriston, a northern district of Glasgow. In 1866 and 1874 Milne had acquired two blocks of land fronting Petrie Terrace (renamed Musgrave Road in 1888), and was recorded as resident on the site from the late 1860s. The kitchen houses attached to the present Warriston may be the original Milne residence. The Milnes occupied No. 2 Warriston (the northern house and closest to the corner of Earle Street and Musgrave Road) until David Milne's death in 1897, while the other side was let to a succession of middle class occupants. These included surveyors WM Davidson and CT Bedford, Albert E Harte (a prominent Queen-street stock and share broker), and Captain James C O'Brien of the Queensland Defence Force. During the 1890s a private school operated in Warriston No. 1. From the 1910s Warriston served as a boarding house, and in the second half of the 20th century was converted into twelve flats (known as Berley Flats), the verandahs being enclosed and the exterior sheeted with asbestos-cement and stucco. In 1986-88 new owners undertook a careful restoration and recycling project to convert the semi-detached houses (at that time still flats) into offices.  Description  Warriston stands on the crest above the Normanby Fiveways, on the edge of the suburb of Petrie Terrace. The building is associated visually with the Normanby Hotel, and together these buildings frame the view of the city from Musgrave Road. Warriston comprises a pair of two-storeyed, semi- detached timber residences with verandahs on both levels, front and back. They are surmounted by a corrugated iron roof with a single hip to the front, but with a divided roof to the rear. Separated by a brick party wall which does not rise above the roofline, from the street, the two houses appear as a single entity. A double staircase with a cross-braced timber balustrade leads to the first level, which is high set at the front. Decorative timber detailing to the front verandahs includes cross-braced balustrades with central rosettes, deep valances on the first level, and double posts with capitals and brackets. The rear verandahs have been enclosed. The side windows, which are sashed, are shaded by galvanised iron hoods with timber fretwork infill and curved timber brackets. Each house is a mirror reflection of the other, with the front door opening into a long hall along the brick party wall. This hall is broken into two sections by an arched screen, with the stairway rising from the rear. The core of each house consists of a pair of reception rooms separated by folding doors on the ground floor, and three bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs, both levels opening onto the verandahs front and back. The kitchens are located in a single-storeyed, low-set, timber building attached at the rear. It is square in shape with a short-ridged roof of corrugated iron and verandahs to either end. Although the former houses now function as offices, the fabric and structure are largely intact. Paint analysis has permitted repainting to the original colours. The building is one of few 19th century semi-detached houses surviving in Brisbane, and is even rarer for its timber construction.  Heritage listing  Warriston was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Historically it is significant in illustrating the pattern of development of Petrie Terrace, one of the earliest suburbs of Brisbane. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Warriston, erected , is significant as a rare, intact timber example of the 19th century semi- detached house form in Brisbane, and in particular of the common-roof type. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is important for its aesthetic contribution to the Petrie Terrace/Red Hill townscape, and for the quality of its restoration and recycling, demonstrating that 19th century form and 20th century function can be compatible.

More than 200,000 people were affected while 21 were killed. This flood have been described as the worst floods in decades. Affected areas As part of the northeast monsoon, heavy rains since 17 December forced 3,390 people in Kelantan and 4,209 people in Terengganu to flee their homes. Several Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) intercity train services along the East Coast route were disrupted on 18 December following the floods. On 20 December, the area of Kajang, Selangor, was also hit by serious floods. By 23 December, most rivers in Kelantan, Pahang, Perak and Terengganu had reached dangerous levels. Due to rising water levels, most businesses were affected and about 60,000 people were evacuated the following day. The state of Kelantan had the most evacuees (20,468 to 24,765), followed by Terengganu (21,606), Pahang (10,825), Perak (1,030), Sabah (336) and Perlis (143). The situation continues to worsen in Kelantan and Terengganu, due to heavy rain. Most roads in Kelantan have been closed. The worst-hit district in Terengganu is Kemaman, followed by Dungun, Kuala Terengganu, Hulu Terengganu, Besut and Marang. In Pahang, the worst-hit areas are Kuantan, Maran, Jerantut, Lipis and Pekan. Dozens of foreign tourists were stranded at a resort in a Malaysian national park in Pahang. Most were travellers from Canada, Britain, Australia and Romania. All were rescued via boat and helicopter. In Kedah, at least 51 people were evacuated. A teenager in Perlis was the first victim to die in this flood. In southern Malaysia, between 300 and 350 people have been displaced in both Johor and Negeri Sembilan. The number of evacuees nationwide reached more than 200,000 by 28 December, with 10 people killed. The flooding is considered the country's worst in decades. However, the exact numbers of evacuees, missing persons and deaths are unknown, as the Malaysian flood centre was unable to provide any accurate figures. Some victim were found in miserable condition as the victim had to survive on one meal of rice a day after he was stranded in the floods. On 31 December, a Royal Malaysia Police Ecureuill AS 355F2 helicopter crashed during a patrol in Kelantan, injuring four crews on board. In Sabah, heavy rains since 21 December resulted in flooding throughout most areas in the district of Beaufort. As many as 30 villages were severely affected due to the water level of Padas River rising up to 9.26 metres above the danger level, with the floods caused mainly by the overflow of water from the river's upper reaches in the Tenom district. About 292 people were evacuated as the flood situation worsened in Beaufort, while the condition improved in the interior districts of Tenom and Kemabong. The number of victims increased to 300 overnight. Most victims in Tenom were able to return home, with only one of the eleven flood relief centres still operational as water levels receded. However, more relief centres are expected to be opened if the rain continues and the water from upper Tenom and Keningau flood the Padas River. In Kudat, 9 families comprising 63 people were affected by floods and have sought shelter at relatives' and neighbours' houses. In Sarawak, several villages in upper Baram hit by floods on 29 December. As of 2 January 2015, floodwaters continued to recede and the number of evacuees in Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang and Perak continued to reduce while the state of Sabah once again prepared for rising numbers of evacuees as floodwaters has started to rise in Kota Belud. Over 1,000 people been evacuated in northern Sabah during the floods. On 3 January, the area of south-western Sipitang district was flooded while floods in the northern Sabah including Kota Belud, Kota Marudu and Pitas had receded. In Tawau, three primary schools were also affected by floods but the waters began to recede at the afternoon. Effects Healthcare As of 29 December, the flooding has affected 102 health facilities in West Malaysia, 38 of which are still operating. An anaesthesiologist working in Kelantan's Kuala Krai Hospital had to intubate a baby in the dark after a diesel generator ran out of fuel. Helicopters were used to evacuate patients from Kuala Krai Hospital as the flood worsened. The 180 hospital staffs have been working tirelessly for over 5 days. The hospital also doubled as a temporary relief centre for flood victims. Universiti Sains Malaysia Hospital (HUSM) in Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, experienced a blood shortage due to overwhelming life-saving demands. Medical students were mobilised to assist medical officers on duty at HUSM. Education Three universities namely Universiti Malaysia Kelantan (UMK), Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT), and Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA) were affected by floods. Students of UMK decided to flee from their university in view of worsening flood crisis. Such affected universities will be allowed to defer their examinations scheduled in early January 2015. In the meantime, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) Penang campus have been urging its Kelantan students to return to their campus earlier to avoid being trapped by floods. As of 28 December 2014, a total of 340 schools in Malaysia have either been converted into flood relief centres or flooded by waters. The Ministry of Education Malaysia announced that opening of all primary and secondary schools will be delayed by 1 week. This is to ensure that all schools are clean and safe for the students before the opening day. Economy Palm oil and rubber prices have surged as flooding has disrupted supplies from Malaysia. Rubber output in Thailand and Malaysia will drop at least 30 per cent and prices been predicted to rise further. As floodwaters in Malaysia are not receding, palm oil production decline sharply. General Shortage of food supplies, electricity, clean water, banking services and erratic communication problems continue to affect flood victims after the flood started to recede. Lack of banking services has caused some petrol stations to run out of small change. Some victims survived on donated relief items while other desperate flood victims started to fight for or steal food and valuables from abandoned homes. One mother was forced to feed her 6 months old infant with formula milk mixed with rainwater. However, flood victims still have rice, bread, canned sardines and egg for dinner at a relief centre. Some unregistered flood victims claimed that they were denied help from NGOs when they tried to stop the NGOs at the side of the road. Tissue papers drenched in cooking oil was used to provide light when there was no electricity or candles supplies. Some flood victims were worried of that their valuables were being stolen from their homes and they have to swim back to their homes every day to check on their items. Prices of essential items were artificially raised. For example, one bottle of water costs MYR5, one large candle costs MYR14, l.5 litres of petrol costs MYR12, and one can of sardines costs MYR8. Some boat owners charged MYR5 for crossing Pahang River and MYR15 for longer journeys. Nevertheless, some quarters argued that the flood has united all Malaysians together to help each other regardless of race, religion, or political stance. Many flood victims in Kelantan, Malaysia, started to cross Golok River into Su-ngai Kolok town to buy essential items at Su-ngai Kolok Municipality Market.  Response   Local  ‚Äî The Malaysian government mobilised all available assets to help in flood rescue operations, the number of rescue team members was increased. Prime Minister Najib Razak said that an additional MYR500 million had been allocated for the state of Sabah. The Prime Minister also brought forward the payment of 1Malaysia People's Aid (BR1M) and special schooling aid of MYR100 to mid-January in order to ease the burden of flood victims. He also said that flood mitigation improvements will be given a priority in the Eleven Malaysia Plan (2016‚Äì2020) to prevent such disaster from recurring as existing flood mitigation systems were unable to cope with the extent of floods that struck several states. The state of Malacca sent around MYR500,000, both the state of Penang and Selangor allocated around MYR1.5 million, the state of Sarawak delivered about MYR2 million, while the state of Terengganu while being itself affected by the floods has donated another MYR1 million. As a mark of respect for all flood victims nationwide, most New Year celebration concerts, including those in Pahang, Perak, Sabah, Selangor and Terengganu, were cancelled. The state of Malacca decided to celebrate the New Year in a simple way and cancelled most of its events. The Malaysian bank Maybank has offered a six-month moratorium on loan instalment payments and waiver of certain charges on a case-by-case basis for customers affected by the floods in the country. The bank also has assisted flood victims through a recent partnership between the Maybank Foundation and Mercy Malaysia. Johor FA has announced a contribution of MYR100,000 to assist the growing number of flood victims on the East Coast. Various non-governmental organisations have contributed their assistance.  International  ‚Äî The Chinese government donated around US$100,000 (MYR339,160) to the Malaysian Red Crescent Society (MCRS). Chinese ambassador to Malaysia Huang Huikang said that the Chinese government is \\"concerned for its Malaysian brothers who are affected by the floods. China wishes to stand by Malaysia and we will not allow Malaysians to face such challenges alone\\". He added that China promised to provide as much relief assistance to Malaysia as possible. Another MYR10 million (US$3.76 million) been sent to Malaysia in the form of items such as 1,600 makeshift tents, generators, sewage pumps and water purifying equipment. ‚Äî Iran's Cultural Office in Kuala Lumpur has expressed sympathy with flood-stricken people in Malaysia's northeastern states.

In a statement on their embassy in Malaysia, \\"the government of Japan expressed sympathy to the people of Malaysia over the massive flooding that forced a huge number of people in the affected areas to be evacuated and ready to offer and provide immediate emergency relief facilities and equipment including generators, water purifiers and other humanitarian goods via Jica. Adding the Japanese government always stands ready to assist Malaysia in such tragic circumstances and earnestly hopes that the Malaysian government and its people will face the adversity with courage\\". The Japanese government also has offer an additional assistance worth around MYR300,000 along with other items such as tents and blankets. ‚Äî The Singaporean government has pledged S$100,000 for flood victims in Malaysia. The Singaporean Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) announced in a statement that the money will be channelled to flood victims by the Singapore Red Cross (SRC), with an additional S$127,000 to be channelled from the Singapore Disaster Response Emergency Fund. An additional MYR600,000 (S$227,000) was given to the Malaysian Red Crescent Society (MRCS) on 30 December. Water purification units were sent to ensure that affected residents have clean drinking water. All mosques in Singapore has organising a special fund to aid flood victims in neighbouring Malaysia, while localised non-profits such as the Tzu Chi Singapore also partook in fundraising efforts. ‚Äî Taiwanese medical workers and volunteers with 12 vehicles loaded with supplies and rescue equipment entered flood-hit areas in Malaysia and offer relief services to victims. Taiwan economic and cultural centre office has donated MYR5,000 (US$1,429) to help flood victims. Taiwan Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation founder Dharma Master Cheng Yan has donated MYR350,000 of vegetarian instant rice to flood victims. ‚Äî Thai authorities provide relief aid and assistance to Malaysian people who living along the border of Narathiwat Province. Narathiwat governor Natthapong Sirichana also took staff into affected areas to offer aid supplies to people struggling with severe floods in Malaysia. Other than Narathiwat, authorities in Pattani, Yala and Songhla Provinces along with Thai Army have gathering donations and volunteers to help the Malaysian state of Kelantan as ordered by Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha. ‚Äî Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al Nahayan who is the President of the Emirates Red Crescent (ERC) has ordered that emergency aid be delivered to flood victims in Malaysia's north-eastern states of Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang. ‚Äî United States Secretary of State John Kerry expressed sympathy to the flood victims in Malaysia and offered US disaster relief assistance for those affected. The United States provide around MYR525,000 to non- governmental organisations (NGOs) who help the flood victims, and offer other aid in the form of medical equipment and medicine. An additional of MYR3 million was sent in the form of materials, programmes and technical assistance. The United States government had also agreed to provide a long- term assistance to Malaysia on storm forecasting and flood mitigation. United States companies and their employees had provided cash and in-kind donations valued at over MYR1.1 million. International Non-Governmental Organisations ( NGO's )  International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) ‚Äî Around CHF82,964 (approximately US$83,000) been delivered to Malaysia as part of the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support 25,000 (5,000 families) for a period of one month. The DREF will fund the distribution of 10,000 blankets for 5,000 families as part of the overall operation. Islamic Relief ‚Äî The organisation focused distributing aid on Rantau Panjang town as the area at present has little support from non-governmental organisations.

On 30 December, the charity arrived and started to distributes aid by stocked 224 ShelterBoxes and 1,032 Midi tents. Controversies As Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was away, his deputy, Muhyiddin Yassin, was in charge for the flood crisis. However, the Prime Minister later ended his vacation amidst criticism from the public when he was seen playing golf with then US President Barack Obama in Hawaii, United States. Najib stressed that the golf game was necessary in establishing diplomatic ties with the United States and the event has been planned much earlier even before the flood started. Some victims have accused the government of being slow to provide assistance. The Malaysian federal government was urged to declare a state of emergency in view of worsening floods. This measure is recommended in order to mobilise all the machinery of the government to tackle the flood situation. However, prime minister Najib decided that state of emergency is not needed because insurance companies will not be paying compensations to the victims as damages will be included in \\"force majeure\\" category. However, the opposition dismissed such explanation by Najib and insurance companies clarifies that as long as flood is covered in a policy, flood victims would be eligible for their claims. Nik Muhammad Abduh, the son of PAS leader Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat, said that the flood is due to the wrath of Allah. Therefore, the Kelantan state government must enforce \\"hudud\\" law, despite widespread opposition against the law. However, the state assembly building where the state government is supposed to table a hudud law has been waterlogged since 25 December. This has caused the state government to postpone the special sitting to a later date. However, the state government was told to help flood victims first instead of focusing on the hudud issue. Muhammad V of Kelantan called for more environmentally friendly measures to prevent such flooding from happening again. Rescue missions have been difficult, due to uncertain weather conditions and some residents' refusal to evacuate. A village head at Kampung Jimah, Lukut, Negeri Sembilan, attempted to chase away opposition representatives who sought to provide aid to victims' families. In another instance, opposition representatives were shooed away by local authorities when they attempted to provide aid at a relief centre in Kluang, Johor.

Game summary This installment of the Peach Bowl was played through a steady rain. The teams combined for 14 turnovers (7 each) and 12 fumbles (8 lost). The sloppy conditions were a factor from the start, as NC State recovered a fumble by Iowa's Chet Davis on the game's opening kickoff.

In 2011 she was honoured for her social justice work in the arts by the Government of Manitoba as part of their celebration of Women in the Arts: Artists Working for Social Change. Her first book of poetry, Quivering Land, was published in 2013 by ARP Books. Roewan Crowe is currently an Associate Professor in the Women's and Gender Studies Department at the University of Winnipeg and Co-Director of The Institute for Women's & Gender Studies. Her creative and scholarly work explores queerness, class, violence, queer ecology, and what it means to be a settler. She lives and works in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Early Life and education Crowe was born to working class parents under the big skies of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Her parents struggled to find work and moved to Alberta in 1969. Crowe lived with her family in Spruce Grove, Alberta until she was 18 years old. After completing an honours bachelor of arts degree at the University of Alberta Crowe moved to Toronto to complete graduate studies in community psychology and arts-based research at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto. After she completed her doctoral studies, she returned to the prairies. Art Roewan Crowe creates work through the use of performance, installation, video, text, and theory, and her recent work creates intimate landscapes, making space for feelings, connection, and queer encounters. Noted work includes: stop-motion animation Queer Grit ‚Äì how can you be queer on the prairies when your dad is John Wayne ‚Äì which has traveled to video and film festivals nationally and internationally; digShift (ongoing), a decolonizing and environmental reclamation project using site specific performance and multichannel installation to explore the shifting layers of an abandoned gas station; Lifting Stone, a queer femme performance/installation creating intimate poetic encounters; and My Monument, a multimedia exhibition with artists cam bush, Steven Leyden Cochrane, Roewan Crowe, and Paul Robles that uses Crowe's book Quivering Land to explore vanished feminist/queer/alternative cultural sites. Her longstanding community practice is concerned with creating space for and building engaged feminist/queer/artistic communities. In collaboration with Mentoring Artists for Women's Art (MAWA) she organized and curated Art Building Community, a project that saw the launch of ten new works and a weekend symposium. Writing Crowe is the author of the book: Quivering Land; scholarly articles; and several chapbooks. She has also written essays about art in various publications. Quivering Land Quivering Land is a rather queer Western, engaging with poetics and politics to reckon with the legacies of violence and colonization in the West. Reviews of Quivering Land include: Herizons: Women's News and Feminist Views, and CWILA, Canadian Women in Literary Arts, an inclusive national literary organization. Selected Scholarly Articles Roewan Crowe's scholarly work seeks to open meaningful encounters with art through feminist engagement. She is particularly interested in exploring and writing about artistic practitioner knowledges and artistic processes.

History The Guild was the last remaining single-screen theater in Downtown Portland, completed in 1927. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the Guild screened classic films, advertised as \\"Oregon's finest film classics theater\\". Later, it changed to showing second-run films. The theater has been closed and out of use since 2006, but a renovation began in 2017, for an unknown purpose. The building was originally called the Taylor Street Theatre until 1947, when J.J. Parker changed the name to the Guild after purchasing the theater. It closed in 2006. The Guild was the home of the Northwest Film Center and the center's Portland International Film Festival from 1998 to 2006. The center had been allowed to lease the theater from its owner, Tom Moyer, for just $1 a year. A proposal in 2010 to renovate and reopen the theater did not come to fruition. 2017 remodel marquee had been renovated In late 2016, Tom Moyer's company, TMT Development, the property's owner, began work on remodeling the building. TMT also owns the adjacent Studio Building (a nine-story office building), and the work on the theater building is part of that $8 million project to renovate both buildings. In January 2017, the company told the Portland Business Journal that the former theater space is being remodeled for a new tenant whose identity could not yet be revealed, due to a non-disclosure agreement. At that time, TMT was forecasting that its part of the remodeling work would be completed by early spring 2017, and the new tenant would then take over the site, in preparation for its own work on the former theater. Renovation of the marquee took place later in 2017.

Geography The intersection consists of: * Musgrave Road to the north-west towards Red Hill and beyond to Brisbane's north-western suburbs. Musgrave Road becomes Waterworks Road at Red Hill, and links to outer-western suburbs such as Ashgrove and The Gap * Kelvin Grove Road to the north towards Kelvin Grove and beyond to Brisbane northern suburbs * College Road to the east towards Spring Hill beyond to the north-eastern suburbs * Countess Street to the south-east towards the Brisbane CBD and the William Jolly Bridge to the southern suburbs * Petrie Terrace (the road) to the south- west towards Petrie Terrace (the suburb) and to the western suburbs History The intersection takes its name from the Normanby Hotel on the corner of Musgrave Road and Kelvin Grove Road, which in turn was named in 1872 most likely after the recently appointed Governor of Queensland, George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby. The opening of the Grey Street Bridge (subsequently renamed the William Jolly Bridge) in 1932 had considerable impact on the Normanby Fiveways. The Grey Street Bridge was intended to relieve congestion on the Victoria Bridge and streets in the Brisbane central business district by allowing traffic between the suburbs on either side of the river to bypass the CBD. However, this created additional traffic into the Normanby Fiveways, which with its unusual five-way traffic movement turned the Normanby Fiveways into one of Brisbane's most dangerous intersections. As a consequence, the introduction of traffic lights to manage traffic flow through the intersection was proposed in 1939. However, by 1952, the Norman Fiveways was now the most congested intersection in Brisbane yet no action had been taken to introduce traffic lights as the government did not have the funds. Traffic lights and alternative strategies such as a subway to carry traffic going between Countess Street and Kelvin Grove Road continued to be proposed. In 1953, tenders were called for the provision of traffic lights which would be the most complicated traffic light system in Brisbane, due to the peculiar five-way character of the intersection. Meanwhile, a ban on paying police for overtime work meant the police who directed the traffic through the Normanby Fiveways finished work in the middle of the evening peak hour, creating traffic chaos. As at 2015, Petrie Terrace (the road) is one-way north into the Fiveways while Countess Street is one-way south, simplifying traffic movement through the (now traffic light controlled) intersection. The construction of the Inner City Bypass and the Go Between Bridge have removed much of the long- distance north-south traffic away from the Normanby Fiveways. The opening of the Legacy Tunnel in 2015 was intended to redirect a greater proportion of traffic to and from the western suburbs away from the Normanby Fiveways.

Androstadienol and androstadienone are odorless compounds secreted by the apocrine glands, and via conversion into the more powerfully-odorous androstenone and androstenol (catalyzed by aerobic corynebacteria, particularly Corynebacterium xerosis, in men, and Micrococcaceae spp. in women), are considered to be mainly responsible for the \\"musky\\" component of axillary (underarm) odor. Androstadienol is synthesized from pregnenolone by the 16-ene-synthetase activity of CYP17A1, and is converted into androstadienone by 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Male sweat contains approximately five times as much androstenone as does female sweat, which can be explained by sex differences in androstadienol and androstadienone production. Androstadienone, which is produced from androstadienol, has been found to affect brain activity. Specifically, it has been found to activate the hypothalamus, most maximally the medial preoptic and anterior hypothalamic areas, in heterosexual women and homosexual men, but not in heterosexual men (who instead experienced hypothalamic activation in response to smelling estratetraenol, an estrogen-related pheromone, while heterosexual women and homosexual men did not). It has also been found to activate the anterior area of the inferior lateral prefrontal cortex, the superior temporal cortex, and olfactory areas. The affected brain areas are thought to be involved in sexual behavior, attention, visual perception/recognition, and social cognition.

A think-tank tasked with studying the philosophy, the Africapitalism Institute was formally launched during the 2014 World Economic Forum on Africa in Abuja, FCT, Nigeria in May of that year. Nigerian philanthropist, private investor and former banker Tony O. Elumelu first iterated the term in 2011, which has been likened to concepts including \\"inclusive capitalism\\", \\"impact investing,\\" \\"conscious capitalism\\" and \\"philanthro-capitalism.\\". However, the neo-capitalism philosophy most closely associated with Africapitalism is the theory of \\"creating shared value\\" ‚Äî a concept defined in a Harvard Business Review article titled \\"Creating Shared Value: Redefining Capitalism and the Role of the Corporation in Society\\", written by renowned economist, Professor Michael E. Porter and Mark R. Kramer of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. The central premise behind creating shared value is that the competitiveness of a company and the health of the communities around it are mutually dependent.  History  Elumelu first introduced the term \\"Africapitalism\\" in 2011 and has outlined the concept‚Äôs main tenets and philosophies in numerous publications, including The Economist, the Financial Times and Fortune. The philosophy is one of the four stated pillars of the mission of The Tony Elumelu Foundation, the charitable foundation he founded the same year. In 2014, the philosophy was buttressed by the establishment of the Africapitalism Institute, a pan-African think tank dedicated to the promotion of the philosophy through \\"rigorous academic-level applied research\\" on the transformative role of the private sector in Africa‚Äôs development. The Institute was formally launched during the 2014 World Economic Forum on Africa in Abuja, Nigeria in May of that year. In February 2015 ‚Äì the Africapitalism Index, which evaluates the manner in which African economies are growing ‚Äì was outlined by the Director of the Institute during an interview on CNBC Africa. The index is one of the signature publications of the institute. African business magazine Ventures Africa referred to U.S. President Barack Obama as \\"Obama the Africapitalist,\\" following his pledge of $7 billion to the \\"Power Africa\\" Initiative, which aims to advance access to power in Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria and Tanzania. The philosophy of Africapitalism was also a theme of the historic, first-ever US-Africa Summit hosted by President Obama in Washington, D.C. in August 2014;http://www.theafricareport.com/East- Horn-Africa/us-africa-summit-congress-and-the-last- hurdle.htmlhttp://www.thecitizen.co.tz/oped/ELUMELU--Summit--Progress-made-- but-work-remains/-/1840568/2427162/-/5bh7xw/-/index.html and a panel at the Africa CEO Forum in Geneva in March 2014.  Characteristics and Philosophy  According to Elumelu, Africapitalism is \\"the middle ground between business and philanthropy.\\" Characteristics of Africapitalism include: * Transforming private investment into social wealth, with homegrown African businesses meeting social and economic needs by creating goods and services with an innate understanding of the local environment. These businesses can bring private capital to vital infrastructure like road transport and power generation, and can create jobs for Africans and an African middle class. * Promoting entrepreneurship. Elumelu has claimed that one of the primary roles of African governments should be in \\"creating the right environment for a new crop of entrepreneurs to emerge,\\" and has described entrepreneurship as \\"the cornerstone to African development.\\" In December 2014, the Tony Elumelu Foundation launched an entrepreneurship program that will devote $100 million over 10 years to identify and help grow 10,000 African startups and young businesses. * Elements of social enterprise. Aspects of Africapitalism share similarities to social enterprise schemes, which champion the dual pursuits of profit and social good through long-term investments Some examples of social enterprise initiatives include country-specific programs like the India Development Marketplace, as well as international ones like the UN Social Enterprise Action Hub, and those led by the Skoll Foundation in the United States and the Khemka Foundation in India. * Local value creation. The economic and geopolitical interests of global powers and not that of Africans, has for centuries shaped Africa‚Äôs destiny. In the years following the end of the Cold War, many African countries have seen steady economic growth, but fueled primarily by non-African exploitation of the continent‚Äôs natural resources with raw material exported as unimproved goods. This resource driven growth does not have the concomitant impact on job creation and other social issues that is required to take the continent out of poverty. Local value creation is an explicit effort on the part of businesses and African policymakers to facilitate more value addition within African economies to ensure more of the benefits of the continent‚Äôs natural resources remain in Africa.http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2015/01/23/guest-post-a-new-framework- for-a-new-age/http://africanbusinessmagazine.com/special-reports/africa-must- focus-creating-local-value/  Scholarly research  In the spring of 2014, Prof. Kenneth Amaeshi, a Nigerian-born academic based at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, initiated an international, multi-disciplinary project to explore the fundamental underpinnings of the Africapitalism philosophy. Later that year, Dr. Amaeshi convened the first-ever academic symposium on Africapitalism during which he and a number of other African scholars presented their preliminary findings from ongoing research. The scholars participating in the University of Edinburgh Africapitalism Project are Amon Chizema, Chair in International Business and Strategy and Head of Discipline, International Business, Strategy and Innovation, Loughborough University, UK; Dr Judy Muthuri, Assistant Professor in Corporate Social Responsibility, Nothingham University Business School; Dr. Nceku Nyathi, Senior Lecturer, Graduate School of Business, University of Cape Town, South Africa; Dr Emmanuel Adegbite, Senior Lecturer in Accounting, Deputy Director for Ethics, Organisations and Society Research, Durham University, United Kingdom; Dr. George N. Njenga, current and Founding Dean, Strathmore Business School, and Deputy Vice Chancellor of Research and Quality Assurance, and Academic Director for the SBS Advanced Management Program; Dr Moses Ochieng, Research Associate, Strathmore University, Kenya; Dr Salimata Ndeye Fall, Professor, International University of Grand Bassam, Abidjan; and David A. Rice, Director of the Africapitalism Institute at the Tony Elumelu Foundation and formerly a professor at New York University and Executive Director of the NYU Development Research Institute founded by global development economist Professor William Easterly. Local value creation was further explored during a public forum held in Abuja, Nigeria on January 7, 2015 when former CNN anchor Zain Verjee moderated a panel of experts that included economist and proprietor of the economic classification terms \\"BRIC\\" and \\"MINT\\", Jim O'Neill, former Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs; Professor Tandeka Nkiwane, Special Advisor to the CEO of the New Economic Partnership for Africa‚Äôs Development (NEPAD); Matthew Bishop, globalization editor of the Economist; Amir Ben Yahmed, Managing Director of the Jeune Afrique Group; and Rasheed Adejare Olaoluwa, Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Bank of Industry Nigeria In 2015, the Tony Elumelu Foundation partnered with another prominent foundation in Africa, South Africa‚Äôs Brenthurst Foundation on a book project. Titled \\"Africans investing in Africa\\", it was co-authored by a number of respected intellectuals across the globe, with an introduction by renowned economist, Paul Collier.http://mg.co.za/article/2015-06-11-reimagining-the-african- continent It launched on the side-lines of the World Economic Forum in June, 2015 in Johannesburg, South Africa. The book espouses Africapitalism, providing a unique perspective of how Africans are leading the way through intra-African trade and investment, documenting how, where and why Africans invest across the continent. Amaeshi and a colleague, Uwafiokun Idemudia published a paper in the African Journal of Management on \\"Africapitalism: A Management Idea for Business in Africa?, exploring the challenges and implications of Africapitalism for management in Africa.\\" Elumelu has spoken extensively on the role of Africapitalism in nation-building at several conferences and forums across the world. In May 2015, he delivered a keynote address at Oxford University http://tonyelumelufoundation.org/feature/africapitalism-catalyst-development- africa-text-speech-tony-o-elumelu-oxford-africa-conference/ on its potential to act as a catalyst for development in Africa, urging more deliberate efforts in driving a new kind of private- sector investment model. The week before, Elumelu had also given a speech at Georgetown University,http://tonyelumelufoundation.org/feature/entrepreneur-led- development-new-model-africa-text-speech-tony-o-elumelu-georgetown-university/ positing that entrepreneurship-led development which Africapitalism seeks to boost, is key to the growth of the continent. In July 2015, Durham University Business School and the Africapitalism Institute partnered to co-host a day- long academic symposium on the philosophy in Lagos. A number of distinguished faculty members from Durham University made presentations to a diverse audience that included scholars, students, business people and investors. Participating faculty members included Professor Geoff Moore, Chair of Business Ethics and Deputy Dean; Professor Mehmet Asutay, an expert in Islamic Finance; senior lecturer Dr. Emmanuel Adegbite, who spoke about Africapitalism and corporate governance; and Mark Learmonth, Professor of Organizational Studies. The day‚Äôs agenda was driven by Dr. Adegbite, who is a member of the Africapitalism Research Project team led by Professor Kenneth Amaeshi. The Institute also released a comprehensive report on the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Africa, analysing challenges facing African entrepreneurs and their proposed solutions.https://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/07/24/africas- entrepreneurs-struggle-with-scarce-finance-and-poor- infrastructure/http://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2015/07/28/elumelu-foundation- releases-report-on-africas-business-climate/ Titled Unleashing Africa‚Äôs Entrepreneurs: Improving the Enabling Environment for Start-ups, it was first released to the public at a world-press conference on the sidelines of the 6th Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Nairobi, Kenya on 25 July 2015. The data used was based on original research leveraging TEF‚Äôs pan-African network of over 20,000 early stage African businesses. The philanthropist, Elumelu has also been consistently articulating his thoughts in advocating for Africapitalism as a vehicle to accelerate the development of Africa, through op-eds on various platforms including TIME,http://time.com/4033366/progress- in-africa-will-help-ease-the-global-migrant-crisis/http://time.com/4052700/un- sustainable-development-goals-africa/ Lib√©rationhttp://www.liberation.fr/evenements- libe/2015/10/07/l-africapitalisme-des-solutions-africaines-aux-enjeux- africains_1399194 and CNN.http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/22/opinions/tony- elumelu-global-entrepreneurship-summit/  Responses to Africapitalism  Africapitalism ‚Äî along with similar efforts focused on a reformed capitalistic economic system that takes the social impact of business in to account ‚Äî has received praise from academics, NGOs, government officials, development and anti-poverty experts and private sector investors. Response from the international development community has also been largely positive. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, in a keynote speech at the 2014 Global Entrepreneurship Summit,http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/20/remarks-vice- president-joe-biden-global-entrepreneurship-summit celebrated the importance of \\"creating an entire climate in which innovation and ideas flourish.\\" African entrepreneurs like Cameroonian Christian Ngan and Kenyan Mubarak Muyika agree that galvanizing the African private sector is crucial to social gains in the continent, as did attendees at the 2014 Africa CEO Forum. Other African leaders in government, academics and business have discussed the importance of harnessing the power of the private sector to drive sustainable development in preparation for the United Nations‚Äô launch of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 ‚Äì the initiative due to succeed the UN‚Äôs Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This was the subject of a public panel discussion held at New York University Stern School of Business - sponsored by the Africapitalism Institute - in September 2014 during the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The School School‚Äôs Dean, Peter Henry, provided the opening remarks, and United Nations Under-Secretary-General and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All, Dr. Kandeh Yumkella gave the keynote address. Dr. Yumkellah‚Äôs remarks were followed by a panel of experts discussing the important role Africa's private sector must play if the Sustainable Development Goals are to be successful.http://www.tonyelumelufoundation.org/africapitalisminstitute/panel- discussion-on-post-2015-mdgs-at-nyu/ Some commentators claim the philosophy is overly dismissive of the role of traditional aid in anti-poverty measures. Joel Bakan, law professor at the University of British Columbia, argues that the Africapitalist philosophy \\"places profound limits on the ability to do good,\\" and that this sort of rhetoric can be used by big businesses to push towards deregulation. Africapitalism and other emerging capitalism reform philosophies have also been criticized as efforts to marginalize the role of government and transfer more influence to the private sector whose fundamental purpose is profit maximization as opposed to fostering broader prosperity. In an op-ed titled Entrepreneurs and Philosopher Kings for Africapitalism,https://blogs.premiumtimesng.com/?p=168342 Jibrin Ibrahim, Director of the Centre for Democracy & Development, opines that the key to the development of capitalism and Africapitalism by extension, is in the hands of the State; effectively echoing Elumelu's position that governments ought to create an enabling environment for entrepreneurs. He stressed that the state needs to play its own role, including ensuring that producers and other entrepreneurs have access to credit, rather than just traders and speculators.  Practice  The program is currently accepting applications for the 2019 edition. Elumelu set up in 2014 the Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship Programme, a decade-long, $100m entrepreneurial initiative in which 1000 young African entrepreneurs get $5,000 in seed capital with the option of a further $5,000 low interest loan or equity each year to nurture their ideas and ultimately develop the continent.http://streamafrica.com/news/1000-african-entrepreneurs- to-benefit-from-tony-elumelu-foundation/  Bibliography  * Amaeshi, Kenneth (2 October 2013) \\"Africapitalism: Unleashing the power of emotions for Africa's development?\\", African Arguments * Court, Alex (5 December 2014) \\"Nigerian billionaire pledges $100 million to help grow 10,000 African startups\\", CNN * Doane, Deborah (25 February 2014) \\"Social enterprise: Can it succeed where traditional development has failed?\\", The Guardian * Edwards, Ruby (12 July 2013) Can Africapitalism save the continent?\\", The Guardian * Hart, Stuart and Prahalad, CK (10 January 2002) \\"The fortune at the bottom of the pyramid\\", Strategy+Business * Jacks, Mzwandile (8 July 2013) \\"Obama the Africapitalist: Creating a private sector development\\", Ventures-Africa.com * Preston, Caroline (5 June 2012) \\"Nigerian banker urges business approach to poverty in Africa\\", The Chronicle of Philanthropy * Stern, Gabriella (8 May 2014) \\"'Africapitalist' says it's time for private sector to step up\\", The Wall Street Journal Frontiers * Young, Holly (13 June 2014) \\"Social enterprise to Africapitalism: Do the alternatives to capitalism work?\\", The Guardian  References  Category:Economic ideologies ","title":"Africapitalism"},{"id":"44928930","text":"The Enchanted Barn is a 1919 American silent drama film produced by Vitagraph Studios. It was directed by David Smith and starred Bessie Love and J. Frank Glendon. The script was written by Kathryn Reed, based on the novel by Grace Livingston Hill Lutz. Bessie Love had been familiar with the source novel, and was instrumental in optioning it for this film. The film is considered lost.  Plot  To care for her ailing mother, young stenographer Shirley (Love) takes her young brother (Butterworth) to find a new home with country air. She finds a barn, owned by the family of Sidney Graham (Glendon), who agrees to rent her the barn. She fixes up the barn, and moves in with her mother and brother. Shirley overhears a conversation between two men who intend to swindle her new landlord in the sale of a mine. She transcribes their words in a stenographic report, and uses it to foil the deal. Graham is very appreciative, and he and Shirley get to know each other. Shirley falls in love with Graham, but she receives word that he is engaged to another woman. The two swindlers seek revenge on Shirley by kidnapping her, but she manages to notify Graham by dropping a note out of a car window. He calls the sheriff, who tracks down the swindlers, and Graham himself finds Shirley. Once reunited, it is revealed that Graham is not, in fact, engaged to another woman, and that he is in love with Shirley.  Cast   Release and reception  Overall, the film received mixed reviews. Bessie Love's performance received good reviews, although it was deemed \\"much as she has appeared in previous productions\\". The plot, however, was highly criticized as being thin. On its release, some theaters showed the film with the Vitagraph comedy short Soapsuds and Sapheads. The film was shown in other theaters with The Dawn of Understanding, which also starred Love, as \\"Bessie Love Day.\\"  References   External links   * Category:1919 lost films Category:1919 films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:American silent feature films Category:American drama films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by David Smith (director) Category:Lost American films Category:Lost drama films ","title":"The Enchanted Barn"},{"id":"44928953","text":"The system of orders, decorations and medals of Uruguay consist of both military and civilian honours.

She was arrested in July 1949, detained at Lubyanka and then at Butyrka prison. She took this event as a necessary break in a period of mental crisis (\\"I suppose the possibility of the existence of a rational, cosmic force, which determines the rhythm of life\\" ... \\"I was in need of fundamental change and it appeared in the form of the arrest\\").). She was convicted under article 58 for 10 years and was sent to Vyatlag (1950‚Äì1955). Prison and the gulag not only did not break her, it made her more indomitable (\\"An entirely interesting life\\" ... \\"I love work, and the natural life in the camp was remarkable. And what a variety of people!\\"), as she became experienced in finding joy and unity with the world: \\"That shoot of wheat from the dead body of Osiris, suddenly germinated in me the will to live... I began to bring orger to internal chaos, to remove piles of collapsed debris and to clear a space for construction\\" ; \\"One can infuse compassion in every step, share sympathetic joy with no one, but it is hardly ever done. Most people associate optimism with egoism, enjoying life with a healthy body, and reject this gift\\". She was released in April 1955. For people, accustomed \\"to fight for survival in the wild and to their own company, reduced to nothing\\" ... \\"the transition to normal life was sometimes more difficult than staying in the Archipelago.\\" Acquaintances expected to see an \\"emaciated 'goner' with a bruised soul, but a returned to their life like wine fermented, astoundingly joyful and happy.\\". After she returned from the camp, she earned a living teaching English, German and French, producing summaries for the Institute of Academic Information on Oriental Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences, doing writing work, etc. She wrote regular Egyptological literature reviews in the Journal of Ancient History.–ï–≥–∏–ø—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∏–∑–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫ (Egyptological Miscellany) She \\"always preferred physical difficulties ‚Äì the 'yoke' ‚Äì and for that reason never served,\\" and thought that she \\"lived the life of a happy person, full of youth's interesting events, catastrophes, gains, losses... lived just as she wished, despite material and day-to-day difficulties.\\". The memoirs of Semper circulated in the samizdat; the autograph is stored in the Manuscripts department of the State Literature Museum.  Critical response  The original publishers of the text believed the very highest talent of the author \\"was the talent of loving to live ‚Äì to journey, new friends, bright colours and the covert, innermost things, which invisibly directs people's fates.\\" Noting the tendency in the twentieth century for the traditionally marginal genre of non-fiction to take the foremost place, the scholar N.P. Krochina notes that N.E. Semper-Sokolova's book \\"a representative example of the genre of memoirs in the twentieth century,\\" considering her in the context of other examples of the genre, like the diaries of Mikhail Prishvin, The Gulag Archipelago of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Ilya Ehrenburg's memoirs People, Years, Life, Sergei Durylin's notes In His Own Corner, Andrei Tarkovsky's Captured Time, etc. In spite of the \\"rich factographic\\" autobiographical narrative, Krochina sees \\"a dominating thread of memory\\" in the \\"establishment of an independent personality, radiating joy and will to live,\\" who managed to absorb and within herself the present and historical world views of east and west.

At the Korea International War Crimes Tribunal in June 2001, the DPRK alleged that US Forces used the tomb \\"to lock up and torture our innocent civilians, during which the frescos were ruthlessly destroyed\\". Description of the Paintings The plaster walls of the tomb were richly decorated with people riding chariots and horses, as well as a musical band. They have all now but disappeared. A portion of the wall painting showing a horse rider was affixed to the wall in 1913 when the tomb was investigated by the Japanese; it later came to Joseon Government-General Museum and is now in the collection of the National Museum of Korea.

He is a vocal proponent of social media as a legitimate way of discovering, distributing, and popularizing the fine arts, primarily using Facebook and Instagram as platforms for self-promotion, discovering new artists, and endorsing those he already manages. Simchowitz believes that conversations on social media hold a degree of influence over the artworld comparable to other canonical forums for artistic discussion and legitimization, including art reviews written by critics for key publications. Supporters see his method as concerned with diversifying the number of systems which recognize and produce credible artists. A number of them, including, but not limited to Sterling Ruby, Oscar Murillo, Lucien Smith, Petra Cortright, Zachary Armstrong, Kour Pour, Jon Rafman, and Marc Horowitz have all been advised by Stefan Simchowitz. In November 2015, he was ranked #95 in Art Review Magazine's POWER 100, a list of 2015's \\"most influential people in the contemporary artworld.\\" Controversy Simchowitz is a popular target for critics who claim that his particular penchant for promoting young, undiscovered artists through bulk acquisitions of their work to later flip for profit, destabilizes established workings of the art world ‚Äî age-old, value-determining systems composed of a long-standing and tight network of critics, publications, universities, museums and galleries that collectively define the nature of 'good' art. He subverts the establishment by selling his curated acquisitions directly to a diverse network of wealthy clients who trust his taste implicitly. In the media, he has received both ample praise and heavy criticism. He has been called the Michael Milken of the art world, and \\"a Sith Lord from the Brotherhood of Darkness,\\" by Jerry Saltz. Art Review's entry on Simchowitz states that \\"if the artworld needed its Howard Stern, its Ari Gold, its Donald Trump, it got 'Simcho': a brash, publicity-hungry yet highly intelligent collector-adviser- dealer...\\". Andrew M. Goldstein of Artspace argued that \\"his approach to collecting and nurturing artists systematically abrogates‚Äîannihilates‚Äîa whole series of beliefs that lie at the foundation of the art world's critical, institutional, and commercial structures.\\" Simchowitz's trademark transparent and honest attitude leads some to believe that he is simply lifting the veil off of previously hidden activities already prevalent in the artworld. Marc Spiegler, director of Art Basel, attributes Simchowitz's success to the fact that he does exactly what the galleries do, except at a significantly faster clip, and the \\"he has taken a market that was built on opacity and been much more transparent. He goes to an artist's studio; he puts the stuff on Instagram.\\" Spiegler characterizes Simchowitz's practice as similar in function to galleries of past, in that he holds exclusive access to his collector base. As such, the approach has been characterized as paradigm- shifting in the context of the contemporary art artworld, while snuggly fitting into an extended historical lineage of the artworld's many businessmen.  Education  Simchowitz spent his early years in South Africa, but otherwise lived a mobile childhood. He graduated from Stanford University with a bachelor's degree in economics, finishing the program in three years. Shortly after, he attended the American Film Institute in Los Angeles. Simchowitz would go on to produce and assistant produce fifteen films.  Producer  After college, Simchowitz started a film production company responsible for a number of feature films and shorts, such as Darren Aronofsky's critically acclaimed drama, Requiem for a Dream.  Filmography  * The Farewell (2011) * Lula (2007) * The Wild (2006) * Till Human Voices Wake Us (2002) * Slap Her... She's French (2002) * Requiem for a Dream (2000) * The Love Letter (1999) * Coming Soon (1999) * Guinevere (1999) * Judas Kiss (1998) * Starstruck (1998) * The Alarmist (1997) * Little City (1997) * The House of Yes (1997) * Johns (1996) * The Chili Con Carne Club (1995) MediaVast In 1999, Simchowitz co-founded the visual content provider MediaVast. Later in 2007, Getty Images acquired the company for a reported 207 million USD. At the time of the sale, the repository held approximately 8.5 million images.  Career  Stefan Simchowitz engages in a hybrid practice that includes art dealing, art advising and art collecting. He believes that \\"the alchemy of art is that it‚Äôs not just the artist who produces the work but the spectator and the audience that essentially refines the art in its raw state into a refined product.\\" As such, once he discovers a young, talented, generally unknown artist with whom to work, he sets about generating a market for them and their work, building demand, which eventually drives up prices. This part of his practice functions not unlike that of an art gallery. In the meantime, Simchowitz provides a patron-like role for the artist, providing them with the finances needed to live, maintain a full-time studio and produce work. He believes that the artist must be committed to their creative work on a full time basis and that financial hardship, as well as the need to make ends meet, can be detrimental to the challenge of making good art. However, in exchange for footing the bill, Simchowitz buys any new work at a discount. Simchowitz burst into the public stage when a 2014 Bloomberg article about speculation in the contemporary art market reported on his purchase on-the- cheap of 34 paintings by the Colombian artist Oscar Murillo near the beginning of his career in the early 2000s, paying as low as 1,500 USD for some canvases. Since then, between 2012 and 2014, the value of a Murillo work surged by nearly 3,000 percent. In the current auction climate, a typical piece by the artist can command as much as 400,000 USD at auction. However, Simchowitz rarely sells the work which he collects, and currently sits on a collection of over 1,500 contemporary works that he values personally at around 30 million USD, with \\"five percent of the works accounting for fifty percent of the value.\\" In addition to dealing and collecting, Simchowitz also works as an art advisor. He serves a roster of clients whom he advises about the acquisition of contemporary art, offering advice, not only on works produced by artists under his representation, but also on art outside his immediate reach (pieces typically for sale at galleries and auction houses).

In addition to being struck by Molotov cocktails, some mosques were vandalized with racist graffiti. The first incident, the only to have caused injuries, was however later found by police investigations to have been an accident in the mosque kitchen caused by an overheated deep-fryer. Attacks On Christmas, five people suffered injuries when, according to early reports, a petrol bomb had been tossed through the window of a mosque in Eskilstuna. Up to 20 people, including children, were in the mosque at the time of the attack. Police later said they were investigating the incident as an accident, considering it unlikely to have been a deliberate attack. It was later reported that an overheated deep-fryer was the probable cause of the fire. The second attack took place on Monday in the southern Swedish town of Esl√∂v just after 3 am local time. No one was injured on that occasion. Early on New Year‚Äôs morning, a third attack hit a mosque in Uppsala.  Background  The attacks happened at a time of rising anti-immigrant sentiment and political tension over Sweden's status as the leading destination in the European Union (per capita) for asylum seekers.  Response  Prime Minister Stefan L√∂fven said that the attacks were \\"hateful violence\\" and denounced the crime. He said that the attacks were not representative of Sweden. and that \\"no-one in Sweden should be afraid of practicing their religion\\".

The fish's head and body are colored brown with white spots at the back. Its abdomen is silvery-white with white spots.

Life Lam was born in Portuguese Macau but moved to Hong Kong as a teenager. He first worked as an office boy for a bank, but after being impressed by the voice acting of Tarzan he applied to be a voice actor at Hong Kong's TVB in 1971. Lam voiced the title character for Doraemon since the very first episode was broadcast by TVB in 1981. He continued to be the voice of Doraemon throughout the decades, only briefly replaced in 1992 when he went over to the rival station Asia Television for a short period. Lam's continuous involvement sets Hong Kong's Doraemon apart from the original Japanese production which went through a re-launch in 2005, resulting in a complete change of voice cast. Lam and other cast members at the time reprised their roles when TVB started to broadcast the new 2005 series. Like his Japanese counterpart, the actor's Doraemon voice is instantly recognisable in Hong Kong and from time to time appears on variety shows and TV commercials. HK Magazine ‚Äì Francis Lam Poh-chuen : the voice of Doraemon Other prominent roles in animation that Lam had voiced include Garfield, Amuro Ray in Mobile Suit Gundam, Genzo Wakabayashi in Captain Tsubasa, Hiei in Yu Yu Hakusho and Squirtle in Pok√©mon. Outside animation, he was also the voice of the corrupt Qing dynasty official Heshen in the 2001 Chinese television series The Eloquent Ji Xiaolan, which remained his favourite role. He was also the usual voice for Sammo Hung and George Clooney in Cantonese dubs of their films. Lam died at the age of 63 on 2 January 2015 in Hong Kong. He was reported to have been found unconscious at home and later confirmed dead at Nethersole Hospital. He was known to be suffering from diabetes. His last work was the 3D feature film Stand by Me Doraemon, which had yet to be released in Hong Kong at the time of his death.

Early life Fraser was born in 1956 in Dunedin, New Zealand. She studied at the Elam School of Fine Arts in Auckland from 1974 to 1977. Work and career Fraser's early work involved installations, inside gallery spaces and in outdoor environments, where she used natural and artificial materials which were woven, plaited, stretched and tied into delicate constructions. Art historian Anne Kirker compared her work from the 1970s and 1980s to 'three- dimensional drawings in space'. From early in her career Fraser was included in significant exhibitions, including the Mildura Sculpture Triennial (Mildura, Australia, 1978); the 1979 Biennale of Sydney; ANZART, the first Australia-New Zealand artist exchange, (Christchurch, 1981); Perspecta 1986 (Art Gallery of New South Wales); NZXI (Auckland City Art Gallery; Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney; and Contemporary Art Institute, Brisbane, 1988) In 1992 Fraser lived and worked in Avize, France, as the Mo√´t et Chandon Fellow. On her return she made the site-specific work He Tohu: The New Zealand Room for the opening of City Gallery Wellington in its Civic Square location. In 1997 Fraser created the major installation Te Ara a Hine for the opening of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. In 2001 Fraser, along with Peter Robinson, represented New Zealand in its first participation at the Venice Biennale. Fraser's installation work, A Demure Portrait of the Artist Strip Searched with 11 Details of Bi-Polar Disorder, is now in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Fraser's work of the 1980s and 1990s was often discussed in contemporary art criticism and theory in terms of identity and cultural politics, and for links to her MƒÅori heritage. From 2000 she has purposefully recast her career and work in an international framework, living and working in Paris and New York. Fraser's work, such as The Making of the Pope of Greenwich Village 2012 (City Gallery Wellington, 2011), The Making of American Gangster 2012 (Michael Lett Gallery, Auckland, 2012) And The Making of the Ciao Manhattan Tapes 2013 (Adam Art Gallery, 2013), include collages in which clippings from magazines are mixed with other materials, such as gold foil, plastic, and wood veneer. These collages are sometimes incorporated into multimedia installations in the gallery spaces, mixed with theatrical lighting, video projections, designer furniture, and cut-out figures, accompanied by soundtracks made from contemporary rap music, including Nicki Minaj and A$AP Rocky. Examples of these works were paired with photographs from Australian artist Tracey Moffat's Up in the sky series in the 2016 exhibition Filmic imaginaries: Jacqueline Fraser and Tracey Moffatt at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Collections Fraser's work is held in private and public collections including Auckland Art Gallery, the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery, the Sarjeant Gallery, the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Christchurch Art Gallery, Dunedin Public Art Gallery, Queensland Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Australia.

It delivered a supply of backpacks to children on the island of Anguilla three months later in September, following the tropical depression Fiona, which caused flooding and damage to the island. With the support of Eric Close, Children of the Caribbean Foundation hosted a fundraiser \\"The Every Child Matters 5K Run/Walk\\" in June 2011, at Loyola Marymount University to raise money for its Education Initiative. In 2011, needy children on the Caribbean islands of Anguilla, Dominica, Trinidad and Jamaica were provided with backpacks containing calculators, notebooks, pens, pencils, dictionaries and other school supplies for the 2011-2012 school year.\\"Children of the Caribbean Incorporation teams up with Department of Social Development to help educate children in Anguilla\\".
