The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 529. Since 2012 it has been part of the Curbridge and Lew joint parish council area, sharing a parish council with the adjacent civil parish of Lew. Romano-British settlement When the Witney Bypass was being built in the 1970s, the remains of a Romano-British settlement were found a short distance northeast of Manor Farm. Foundations were found of rectangular timber-framed buildings, some with limestone rubble foundations. A cemetery was found, containing 18 burials. There may have been more, but if so they are now beneath the bypass. Most of the bodies lay with their heads pointing east or north. Three of the adults had been beheaded, and were laid with their heads between their legs. This was a burial practice in the late Roman and early Anglo-Saxon eras. It is not known whether beheading was the cause of death or was done posthumously. In a later phase of settlement, a midden covered the cemetery. Artefacts found included a whetstone made from local limestone, a copper alloy brooch, a copper finger ring, a bronze Roman coin from the reign of the Roman usurper Magnentius (AD 350‚Äì353), fragments of Romano-British pottery, and clusters of hobnails showing where leather footwear had rotted away in the ground. History Caswell Farm, southwest of the village, is a moated farmstead that includes remnants of a 15th-century house. It is a Grade II* listed building. In the mid-1970s the Witney Bypass was built to allow the A40 trunk road to pass south of Witney. It was built through Curbridge parish only north of the village. The bypass was made the new civil parish boundary, and that part of the parish north of it was transferred to Witney. Parish church A Church of England chapel was built in Curbridge in 1838 and the Gothic Revival architect CC Rolfe added an apse in 1874. In 1906 the chapel was demolished and replaced with the present Church of England parish church of Saint John the Baptist. Its parish is part of the Benefice of Witney, which also includes Hailey.

The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 1,581. History Ducklington is one of the earliest Saxon parishes to be recorded in Oxfordshire. In a charter of AD 958 King Edgar the Peaceful granted at Duclingtun to his Minister, Eanulf. An Anglo-Saxon charter from AD 1036 also records the toponym as Duclingtun, and another Anglo-Saxon document from AD 1044 records it as Ducelingdun. The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as Dochelintone and a charter from AD 1130 records it as Dukelindona. The name is derived from Old English. The first element may be from the name of a person called Ducca or Ducel. The element \\"-ing\\" most commonly means \\"people of\\". The element \\"-t≈´n\\" means an enclosure, homestead or village. The fact that the village has a duck pond with a population of ducks is purely incidental. After the Norman Conquest Ducklington was held by Robert D'Oyly, a Norman nobleman who took part in William I's conquest of England. The Dyve family then held the Lordship of Ducklington throughout the 13th and 14th centuries, living there until early in the reign of Edward III. The Church of England parish church of Saint BartholomewParish Church of Saint Bartholomew is 12th century. The Gothic Revival architect EG Bruton restored the building in 1871. The bell tower has a ring of six bells. William and Henry III Bagley of Chacombe in Northamptonshire cast the second, fourth and fifth bells in 1708. Robert Taylor & Sons cast the tenor bell in 1829, presumably at their then foundry in Oxford. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble bell in 1889. The Royal Eijsbouts bell foundry of Asten in the Netherlands cast the third bell in 1988. The village had a Baptist Chapel until 2016, when it was converted into a private home. The former village schoolhouse was built in 1858. The modern Ducklington Church of England Primary School is across the village green from the original site.Ducklington CE Primary School Ducklington Pre-School St Bartholomew's parish church Natural history Ducklington is notable for the rare fritillary flower (mainly of the snake's head variety), many of which grow in a specially designated meadow just outside the village. Before the Second World War many fritillaries had grown on fields all over the Windrush Valley. However, the national drive for food production during the war meant that most meadows were intensively ploughed, the rivers dredged, and consequently the fritillaries were lost. Only the current fritillary field happened to be left unploughed. The flowers have survived with help from both locals and farmers. Once a year, the local community celebrates Fritillary Sunday when the field, parish church and hall are opened so that the public may walk among and enjoy the flowers. Amenities Ducklington has a Morris dancing sideDucklington Morris and Mummers performances. It also has its own Morris Dance tradition; its own style of dance that was collected around the beginning of the 19th century. The Ducklington tradition is danced by many sides throughout Britain and the United States. Ducklington has one public house: The Bell, and a sports and social club. Recently Ducklington has hosted several flower and garden shows. The former tithe barn is now the village hall, which has been renovated in the last few years.District Council Grant Scheme It is used by village groups including the Parish Council and is the parish polling station in local and national elections.

A client of the pool will request an object from the pool and perform operations on the returned object. When the client has finished, it returns the object to the pool rather than destroying it; this can be done manually or automatically. Object pools are primarily used for performance: in some circumstances, object pools significantly improve performance. Object pools complicate object lifetime, as objects obtained from and returned to a pool are not actually created or destroyed at this time, and thus require care in implementation.  Description  When it is necessary to work with a large number of objects that are particularly expensive to instantiate and each object is only needed for a short period of time, the performance of an entire application may be adversely affected. An object pool design pattern may be deemed desirable in cases such as these. The object pool design pattern creates a set of objects that may be reused. When a new object is needed, it is requested from the pool. If a previously prepared object is available it is returned immediately, avoiding the instantiation cost. If no objects are present in the pool, a new item is created and returned. When the object has been used and is no longer needed, it is returned to the pool, allowing it to be used again in the future without repeating the computationally expensive instantiation process. It is important to note that once an object has been used and returned, existing references will become invalid. In some object pools the resources are limited so a maximum number of objects is specified. If this number is reached and a new item is requested, an exception may be thrown, or the thread will be blocked until an object is released back into the pool. The object pool design pattern is used in several places in the standard classes of the .NET Framework. One example is the .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server. As SQL Server database connections can be slow to create, a pool of connections is maintained. Closing a connection does not actually relinquish the link to SQL Server. Instead, the connection is held in a pool from which it can be retrieved when requesting a new connection. This substantially increases the speed of making connections.  Benefits  Object pooling can offer a significant performance boost in situations where the cost of initializing a class instance is high and the rate of instantiation and destruction of a class is high ‚Äì in this case objects can frequently be reused, and each reuse saves a significant amount of time. Object pooling requires resources ‚Äì memory and possibly other resources, such as network sockets, and thus it is preferable that the number of instances in use at any one time is low, but this is not required. The pooled object is obtained in predictable time when creation of the new objects (especially over network) may take variable time. These benefits are mostly true for objects that are expensive with respect to time, such as database connections, socket connections, threads and large graphic objects like fonts or bitmaps. In other situations, simple object pooling (that hold no external resources, but only occupy memory) may not be efficient and could decrease performance. In case of simple memory pooling, the slab allocation memory management technique is more suited, as the only goal is to minimize the cost of memory allocation and deallocation by reducing fragmentation.  Implementation  Object pools can be implemented in an automated fashion in languages like C++ via smart pointers. In the constructor of the smart pointer, an object can be requested from the pool, and in the destructor of the smart pointer, the object can be released back to the pool. In garbage-collected languages, where there are no destructors (which are guaranteed to be called as part of a stack unwind), object pools must be implemented manually, by explicitly requesting an object from the factory and returning the object by calling a dispose method (as in the dispose pattern). Using a finalizer to do this is not a good idea, as there are usually no guarantees on when (or if) the finalizer will be run. Instead, \\"try ... finally\\" should be used to ensure that getting and releasing the object is exception-neutral. Manual object pools are simple to implement, but harder to use, as they require manual memory management of pool objects.  Handling of empty pools  Object pools employ one of three strategies to handle a request when there are no spare objects in the pool. # Fail to provide an object (and return an error to the client). # Allocate a new object, thus increasing the size of the pool. Pools that do this usually allow you to set the high water mark (the maximum number of objects ever used). # In a multithreaded environment, a pool may block the client until another thread returns an object to the pool.  Pitfalls  When writing an object pool, the programmer has to be careful to make sure the state of the objects returned to the pool is reset back to a sensible state for the next use of the object. If this is not observed, the object will often be in some state that was unexpected by the client program and may cause the client program to fail. The pool is responsible for resetting the objects, not the clients. Object pools full of objects with dangerously stale state are sometimes called object cesspools and regarded as an anti-pattern. The presence of stale state is not always an issue; it becomes dangerous when the presence of stale state causes the object to behave differently. For example, an object that represents authentication details may break if the \\"successfully authenticated\\" flag is not reset before it is passed out, since it will indicate that a user is correctly authenticated (possibly as someone else) when they haven't yet attempted to authenticate. However, it will work just fine if you fail to reset some value only used for debugging, such as the identity of the last authentication server used. Inadequate resetting of objects may also cause an information leak. If an object contains confidential data (e.g. a user's credit card numbers) that isn't cleared before the object is passed to a new client, a malicious or buggy client may disclose the data to an unauthorized party. If the pool is used by multiple threads, it may need the means to prevent parallel threads from grabbing and trying to reuse the same object in parallel. This is not necessary if the pooled objects are immutable or otherwise thread-safe.  Criticism  Some publications do not recommend using object pooling with certain languages, such as Java, especially for objects that only use memory and hold no external resources. Opponents usually say that object allocation is relatively fast in modern languages with garbage collectors; while the operator \`new\` needs only ten instructions, the classic \`new\` - \`delete\` pair found in pooling designs requires hundreds of them as it does more complex work. Also, most garbage collectors scan \\"live\\" object references, and not the memory that these objects use for their content. This means that any number of \\"dead\\" objects without references can be discarded with little cost. In contrast, keeping a large number of \\"live\\" but unused objects increases the duration of garbage collection.  Examples  = Go = The following Go code initializes a resource pool of a specified size (concurrent initialization) to avoid resource race issues through channels, and in the case of an empty pool, sets timeout processing to prevent clients from waiting too long. // package pool package pool import ( \\"errors\\" \\"log\\" \\"math/rand\\" \\"sync\\" \\"time\\" ) const getResMaxTime = 3 * time.Second var ( ErrPoolNotExist = errors.New(\\"pool not exist\\") ErrGetResTimeout = errors.New(\\"get resource time out\\") ) //Resource type Resource struct { resId int } //NewResource Simulate slow resource initialization creation // (e.g., TCP connection, SSL symmetric key acquisition, auth authentication are time- consuming) func NewResource(id int) *Resource { time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond) return &Resource;{resId: id} } //Do Simulation resources are time consuming and random consumption is 0~400ms func (r *Resource) Do(workId int) { time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(5)) * 100 * time.Millisecond) log.Printf(\\"using resource #%d finished work %d finish \\", r.resId, workId) } //Pool based on Go channel implementation, to avoid resource race state problem type Pool chan *Resource //New a resource pool of the specified size // Resources are created concurrently to save resource initialization time func New(size int) Pool { p := make(Pool, size) wg := new(sync.WaitGroup) wg.Add(size) for i := 0; i < size; i++ { go func(resId int) { p <- NewResource(resId) wg.Done() }(i) } wg.Wait() return p } //GetResource based on channel, resource race state is avoided and resource acquisition timeout is set for empty pool func (p Pool) GetResource() (r *Resource, err error) { select { case r := <-p: return r, nil case <-time.After(getResMaxTime): return nil, ErrGetResTimeout } } //GiveBackResource returns resources to the resource pool func (p Pool) GiveBackResource(r *Resource) error { if p  nil { return ErrPoolNotExist } p <- r return nil } // package main package main import ( \\"github.com/tkstorm/go-design/creational/object-pool/pool\\" \\"log\\" \\"sync\\" ) func main() { // Initialize a pool of five resources, // which can be adjusted to 1 or 10 to see the difference size := 5 p := pool.New(size) // Invokes a resource to do the id job doWork := func(workId int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) { defer wg.Done() // Get the resource from the resource pool res, err := p.GetResource() if err != nil { log.Println(err) return } // Resources to return defer p.GiveBackResource(res) // Use resources to handle work res.Do(workId) } // Simulate 100 concurrent processes to get resources from the asset pool num := 100 wg := new(sync.WaitGroup) wg.Add(num) for i := 0; i < num; i++ { go doWork(i, wg) } wg.Wait() } = C# = In the .NET Base Class Library there are a few objects that implement this pattern. \`System.Threading.ThreadPool\` is configured to have a predefined number of threads to allocate. When the threads are returned, they are available for another computation. Thus, one can use threads without paying the cost of creation and disposal of threads. The following shows the basic code of the object pool design pattern implemented using C#. For brevity the properties of the classes are declared using C# 3.0 automatically implemented property syntax. These could be replaced with full property definitions for earlier versions of the language. Pool is shown as a static class, as it's unusual for multiple pools to be required. However, it's equally acceptable to use instance classes for object pools. namespace DesignPattern.Objectpool { // The PooledObject class is the type that is expensive or slow to instantiate, // or that has limited availability, so is to be held in the object pool. public class PooledObject { DateTime _createdAt = DateTime.Now; public DateTime CreatedAt { get { return _createdAt; } } public string TempData { get; set; } } // The Pool class is the most important class in the object pool design pattern. It controls access to the // pooled objects, maintaining a list of available objects and a collection of objects that have already been // requested from the pool and are still in use. The pool also ensures that objects that have been released // are returned to a suitable state, ready for the next time they are requested. public static class Pool { private static List _available = new List(); private static List _inUse = new List(); public static PooledObject GetObject() { lock(_available) { if (_available.Count != 0) { PooledObject po = _available[0]; _inUse.Add(po); _available.RemoveAt(0); return po; } else { PooledObject po = new PooledObject(); _inUse.Add(po); return po; } } } public static void ReleaseObject(PooledObject po) { CleanUp(po); lock (_available) { _available.Add(po); _inUse.Remove(po); } } private static void CleanUp(PooledObject po) { po.TempData = null; } } } In the code above, the PooledObject includes two properties. One holds the time at which the object was first created. The other holds a string that can be modified by the client but that is reset when the PooledObject is released back to the pool. This shows the clean-up process on release of an object that ensures it is in a valid state before it can be requested from the pool again. = Java = Java supports thread pooling via \`java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService\` and other related classes. The executor service has a certain number of \\"basic\\" threads that are never discarded. If all threads are busy, the service allocates the allowed number of extra threads that are later discarded if not used for the certain expiration time. If no more threads are allowed, the tasks can be placed in the queue. Finally, if this queue may get too long, it can be configured to suspend the requesting thread. public class PooledObject { public String temp1; public String temp2; public String temp3; public String getTemp1() { return temp1; } public void setTemp1(String temp1) { this.temp1 = temp1; } public String getTemp2() { return temp2; } public void setTemp2(String temp2) { this.temp2 = temp2; } public String getTemp3() { return temp3; } public void setTemp3(String temp3) { this.temp3 = temp3; }} public class PooledObjectPool { private static long expTime = 6000;//6 seconds public static HashMap available = new HashMap(); public static HashMap inUse = new HashMap(); public synchronized static PooledObject getObject() { long now = System.currentTimeMillis(); if (!available.isEmpty()) { for (Map.Entry entry : available.entrySet()) { if (now - entry.getValue() > expTime) { //object has expired popElement(available); } else { PooledObject po = popElement(available, entry.getKey()); push(inUse, po, now); return po; } } } // either no PooledObject is available or each has expired, so return a new one return createPooledObject(now); } private synchronized static PooledObject createPooledObject(long now) { PooledObject po = new PooledObject(); push(inUse, po, now); return po; } private synchronized static void push(HashMap map, PooledObject po, long now) { map.put(po, now); } public static void releaseObject(PooledObject po) { cleanUp(po); available.put(po, System.currentTimeMillis()); inUse.remove(po); } private static PooledObject popElement(HashMap map) { Map.Entry entry = map.entrySet().iterator().next(); PooledObject key= entry.getKey(); //Long value=entry.getValue(); map.remove(entry.getKey()); return key; } private static PooledObject popElement(HashMap map, PooledObject key) { map.remove(key); return key; } public static void cleanUp(PooledObject po) { po.setTemp1(null); po.setTemp2(null); po.setTemp3(null); } }  See also  * Connection pool * Free list * Slab allocation Notes References  External links  * OODesign article * Improving Performance with Object Pooling (Microsoft Developer Network ) * Developer.com article * Portland Pattern Repository entry * Apache Commons Pool: A mini-framework to correctly implement object pooling in Java * Game Programming Patterns: Object Pool Software design patterns Software optimization Articles with example C Sharp code ","title":"Object pool pattern"},{"id":"2840377","text":"Georges Anderla (March 27, 1921 in Prague - April 26, 2005 in AntibesGeorges Anderla in the BNF catalog ) was a Czech-born French economist.

It is also used in pleading, as the statement of the plaintiff's money loss or damages claimed.See Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(3). An ad damnum clause is also sometimes called a \\"prayer for relief.\\" Several U.S. states prohibit plaintiffs from demanding a specific amount of money in the section of a complaint initiating a civil action for personal injury or wrongful death. This is to prevent unethical attorneys from gaining undue publicity for their cases (and trampling upon the due process rights of defendants) by demanding outrageous amounts that they cannot possibly prove at trial. This is why such complaints simply demand amounts \\"in excess of $[X]\\" (where X is the minimum amount in controversy necessary to get into the trial court of general jurisdiction), \\"pecuniary loss\\", or \\"monetary damages in an amount according to proof.\\" Of course, at some point the defendant needs to get some idea of what amount of money the plaintiff actually wants, so the defendant can usually serve interrogatories directed to that issue or a formal request for a statement of damages as part of the discovery process.

Stephen Charnock (1628‚Äì27 July 1680), Puritan divine, was an English Puritan Presbyterian clergyman born at the St Katherine Cree parish of London. Title page of Charnock's magnum opus Life Charnock studied at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, during which he was converted to the Christian faith, beginning his spiritual journey as a Puritan divine. After leaving the college, he possibly held a position as either a private teacher or tutor, then moving on to become a minister of the faith in Southwark for a short time, converting individuals to Christianity. He continued on to New College, Oxford, where he earned a fellowship and gained a position as senior proctor He moved to Ireland in 1656 where he became a chaplain to Henry Cromwell, governor of Ireland. In Dublin, he began a regular ministry of preaching to other believers. Those who came to hear him were from different classes of society and differing denominations, and he became widely known for the skill by which he discharged his duties. In 1660, the monarchy of England was restored after its brief time as the Commonwealth of England, and Charles II ascended the throne of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Due to new restrictions, Charnock was now legally prevented from practicing public ministry in Ireland, and in England where he returned. Nevertheless, he continued to study and to minister in non-public ways. Charnock began a co- pastorship at Crosby Hall in London in 1675; this was his last official place of ministry before his death in 1680. Works Nearly all of the numerous writings attributed to him were transcribed after his death. Charnock's theological fame rests chiefly in his Discourses upon the Existence and Attributes of God, a series of lectures delivered to the members of his congregation at Crosby Hall; unfortunately, however, the Discourses were cut short by Charnock's death in 1680. The treatise is preserved today as The Existence and Attributes of God, first published posthumously in 1682.

It rises near Winchcombe in Gloucestershire and flows south east for via Burford and Witney to meet the Thames at Newbridge in Oxfordshire. The river gives its name to the village of Windrush in Gloucestershire. River The Windrush starts in the Cotswold Hills in Gloucestershire northeast of Taddington, which is north of Guiting Power, Temple Guiting, Ford and Cutsdean. It flows for about : through Bourton-on-the-Water, by the village of Windrush, Gloucestershire, into Oxfordshire and through Burford, Witney, Ducklington and Standlake. It meets the Thames at Newbridge upstream of Northmoor Lock. The river-name Windrush is first attested in an Anglo-Saxon charter of 779, where it appears as Uuenrisc. It appears as Wenris and W√¶nric in charters of 949, and Wenr√≠c in one of 969. The name means 'white fen', from the Welsh gwyn and the Old Celtic reisko.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.523. The river may still host trout, grayling, perch, chub, roach and dace. It held good populations of native crayfish until at least the 1980s. Its waters were used in cloth and woollen blanket making in Witney from mid 17th century. In 2007, it was among many of the district's rivers to flood. It flooded generally but perhaps most acutely in Witney, whose only bridge across the river was submerged. Some decline has been noted, especially in years of duly reported and fined untreated sewage from plants of Thames Water. The river after drier spells sees algae formations. The ship , synonymous with post-war immigration of West Indian people to the UK, was named after the river.

He was born in 1660 at Teining in Bavaria. Having completed his early studies he entered the novitiate of the Order of St. Benedict at Ettal Abbey in 1681, made his religious profession in 1682, and thereafter devoted the greater part of his life to teaching. At the commencement of his studies he had given no promise of brilliancy, but by his untiring application and industry he shortly acquired so vast a store of knowledge, that he soon came to be regarded as one of the most learned men of his day -- \\"vir comsummatae in omni genere dictrinae et probitatis\\", as he is styled in Dom Egger's Idea ordinis Hierarchico-Benedictini, and in the History of the University of Salzburg. Until 1690 Babenstuber was Director of the scholasticate of his order at Salzburg, taught philosophy there from 1690 to 1693, then went to the Augustinian Schlehdorf Abbey to teach theology in the monastery of the Canons Regular. Returning to Salzburg in 1695, he took up successively the professorships of moral theology, dogmatic theology, and exegesis, in the celebrated Benedictine university of that city. He remained at Salzburg for twenty-two years, during which period he held the office of vice-rector for three years, and that of vice-chancellor of the university for six. In 1717 he returned to his monastery at Ettal, where he spent the remainder of his days. In dogmatic theology Babenstuber was a pronounced Thomist; in moral, a vigorous defender of probabilism. He maintained, among other things, that a single author, if he were \\"beyond contradiction\\" (omni exceptione major), could, of his own authority, render an opinion probably, even against general opinion. In matters of faith, however, he rejected the principle of probabilism absolutely. In one of his disquisitions he had also stated that it was allowable to celebrate Mass privately on Maundy Thursday and Holy Saturday, but before his Ethica Supernaturalis had issued from the press, he learned that the Roman tribunals forbade it, and so he promptly corrected that assertion. Babenstuber's published works include a wide range of subjects, mainly philosophical and theological. The most important are Philosophia Thomistica (4 vols., Salzburg, 1704) and Ethica Supernaturalis (Augsburg, 1718). He died on 5 April 1726 at the Benedictine monastery of Ettal.

He is an Athenian who tries to keep his daughter, Hermia, from marrying Lysander (the man she loves). In original performances, the actor for his role probably played the part of Philostrate as well. Egeus wants Hermia to marry Demetrius. Role in the play Appearing in Scene 1 and Scene 11, Egeus is the father of Hermia, who disapproves of Hermia's and Lysander's love, appealing to Theseus to force Hermia to marry Demetrius. If Hermia refuses to wed Demetrius, she could be put to death, or cloistered in a nunnery for the rest of her life ‚Äî both sentences supported by Athenian law. Criticism Egeus plays a key part in illustrating the loveplay's theme of law versus love, and reason versus imagination. Constantly refusing his daughter's plea to marry the man she loves, Lysander, he demands that she be forced to marry Demetrius. He goes so far as to say that if she disobeys, he as a father has a right to kill her, or to force her into a convent as a nun for life. Hermia embodies the opposition to the law and reason of her father. She follows her feelings and imagination regarding Lysander, rather than strictly adhering to her father's will (thus his preferential disposition towards Demetrius). Barroll, Leeds and Susan Zimmerman (eds.) Shakespeare Studies. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press (November 2004). . pgs. 104-106. Performances In original performance A Midsummer Night's Dream, the actor for Egeus and Philostrate were probably one and the same. This can be gathered through discrepancies between the First Folio and earlier quarto versions of the play. In Act V, scene 1, for example, the quartos say \\"Call Philostrate\\", while the 1623 Folio says \\"Call Egeus\\". One actor filling both roles also explains some of the jumbled dialogue in this scene, as it was probably the result of confusion over the role the actor was playing at the time.Collier, J. Payne. Notes and Emendations to the Text of Shakespeare's Plays from Early Manuscript Corrections in a Copy of the Folio, 1632. Burt Franklin: September 1970. Furness interprets this a little differently, saying that Shakespeare may not have originally intended both roles to be played by the same person, but that directors combined the roles to save money. Act V, scene 1 is the only scene in which both men are present at the same time. Philostrate, as the less-important one, would thus probably have been stricken out, while Egeus would have filled both roles. This change in staging would reveal an alteration from Shakespeare's original text.Furness, Horace Howard (Ed). A Midsummer Night's Dream (A New Variorum Edition of Shakespeare).

The terms were published on 20 January 1841, but both governments rejected them and dismissed Elliot and Qishan, respectively, from their positions. Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston stated that Elliot acquired too little while the Daoguang Emperor believed Qishan conceded too much. Palmerston appointed Major-General Henry Pottinger to replace Elliot, while the emperor appointed Yang Fang to replace Qishan, along with Yishan as General-in-Chief of Repressing Rebellion and Longwen as an assistant regional commander. Although the convention was unratified, many of the terms were later included in the Treaty of Nanking (1842).  Background  On 20 February 1840, Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston instructed the joint plenipotentiaries Captain Charles Elliot and his cousin Admiral George Elliot to acquire the cession of at least one island for trade on the Chinese coast, amongst other terms.Morse 1910, p. 628 In November 1840, during the First Opium War, George returned to Britain due to ill health, leaving Charles as sole plenipotentiary. In negotiations with Imperial Commissioner Qishan, Elliot wrote on 29 December to \\"request a place in the outer sea, where the British can fly their flag and administer themselves, just as the Westerners do in Macao.\\"Mao 2016, p. 192 However, the year ended with no agreement. To force Chinese concessions, the British captured the forts at the entrance of the Humen strait (Bogue) on 7 January 1841, after which Qishan agreed to consider Elliot's demands. Negotiations ensued at the Bogue near Chuenpi.Bernard & Hall 1844, p. 134 On 11 January, Qishan offered to \\"grant a place outside the estuary to lodge temporarily\\". He later wrote to Elliot on 15 January, offering either Hong Kong Island or Kowloon but not both. Elliot replied the next day, accepting Hong Kong. On 15 January, trader James Matheson wrote to his business partner William Jardine that Elliot arrived in Macao the night before: \\"I learn from him very confidentially that Ki Shen [Qishan] has agreed to the British having a possession of their own outside, but objects to ceding Chuenpee; in lieu of which Captain Elliot has proposed Hong Kong\\".Lowe 1989, p. 12 One factor that may have led to settling on Hong Kong was the perceived ambiguity of the Chinese language. Matheson believed that when Qishan wrote \\"as we have granted you territory you do not now require another port\\", Elliot as a result gave up demands of British access to a port in northern China in the hope that he could hold Qishan to an interpretation of the Chinese characters in which the British had been ceded Hong Kong rather than just being given a trading factory there.Lowe 1989, p. 9Le Pichon 2006, pp. 465‚Äì466  Terms  On 20January, Elliot issued a circular announcing \\"the conclusion of preliminary arrangements\\" between Qishan and himself involving the following conditions:The Chinese Repository, vol. 10, p. 63 Other terms that were agreed upon were the restoration of the islands of Chuenpi and Taikoktow to the Chinese, and the evacuation of Chusan (Zhoushan), which the British had captured and occupied since July 1840.\\"No. 19984\\". The London Gazette. 3 June 1841. pp. 1423‚Äì1424. Chusan was returned in exchange for the release of British prisoners in Ningpo who became shipwrecked on 15 September 1840 after the brig Kite struck quicksand en route to Chusan.The Chinese Repository, vol. 10, p. 191Bingham, vol. 1, p. 271 The convention allowed the Qing government to continue collecting tax at Hong Kong, which was the main sticking point that led to the disagreement according to Lord Palmerston.Courtauld et al. 1997  Aftermath  Cage with Anne Noble. Her husband Captain John Noble and infant son died in the Kite shipwreck en route to Chusan.Scott 1842, pp. 5, 9 She was later released with other prisoners in exchange for the evacuation of Chusan. The forts were restored to the Chinese on 21 January in a ceremony on Chuenpi, which had been held by Captain James Scott as pro tempore governor of the fort. Commodore Gordon Bremer, commander-in-chief of British forces in China, sent an officer to Anunghoy (north of Chuenpi) with a letter for Chinese Admiral Guan Tianpei, informing him of their intention to return the forts. About an hour later, Guan sent a mandarin to receive them. The British colours were hauled down and the Chinese colours were hoisted in their place, under a salute fired from HMS Wellesley, and returned by the Chinese with a salute fired from the Anunghoy batteries.Mackenzie 1842, p. 30Ellis 1866, p. 148 The ceremony was repeated at Taikoktow.The United Service Journal 1841, p. 244 Military secretary Keith Mackenzie observed: \\"I never saw a [Chinese] man in such an ecstasy of chin chin [a gesture of greeting or farewell], as he was, when our colours were lowered‚Äîhe absolutely jumped for joy.\\"Mackenzie 1842, p. 31 Two days later, Elliot dispatched the brig Columbine to Chusan, with instructions to evacuate it for Hong Kong. Duplicates of these dispatches were also forwarded overland by the imperial express. At the same time, Qishan directed Yilibu, the viceroy of Liangjiang, to release the British prisoners at Ningpo.Ouchterlony 1844, p. 107 News of the terms was sent to England aboard the East India Company steamer Enterprise, which left China on 23January.Eitel 1895, p. 163 On the same day, the Canton Free Press published the opinion of British residents in China regarding the cession of Hong Kong: The British possession ceremony in Hong Kong On 26 January 1841, Commodore Bremer took formal possession of Hong Kong with the naval officers of the squadron at Possession Point, where the Union Jack was raised, under a feu de joie from the Royal Marines and a royal salute from the warships.The Chinese Repository, vol. 12, p. 492 = Banquet = View looking up the Bocca Tigris to the Second Bar pagoda, where the banquet took place On the same day as the Hong Kong ceremony, Elliot left Macao on board the steamer Nemesis to meet Qishan at Lotus Flower Hill near the Second Bar pagoda to settle the convention.Waley 1958, p. 132Bernard & Hall 1844, p. 135 100 marines from the Wellesley, Druid, and Calliope were embarked on board the steamer Madagascar to be Elliot's guard of honour. He was accompanied by several officers, including Lieutenant Anthony Stransham, Captain Thomas Herbert, and Captain Thomas Maitland, as well as the military band of the Wellesley. As the steamers passed through the Bogue, they were saluted with three guns by the forts on both sides. The steamer returned the salute while the band played \\"God Save the Queen\\".Bernard & Hall 1844, p. 137Mackenzie 1842, p. 34 The ships arrived too late in the evening to land, but Qishan sent a few staff who said he would be ready to receive them in the morning.Mackenzie 1842, pp. 35‚Äì36 At 9 am, after boarding the steamers' boats and Chinese boats provided by Qishan, they sailed to the landing place about up a creek. The marine guard was drawn up for Elliot, accompanied by Captain Herbert and Captain Richard Dundas, and preceded by the band before Qishan received the party at his main tent.Bernard & Hall 1844, p. 139 This was the first time in Sino-British relations that a Chinese high official received a British representative, with a carefully selected suite, not as a \\"barbarian vassal\\" but as a plenipotentiary of standing.Hoe & Roebuck 1999, p. 152 A series of dishes were served at the luncheon for over 20 people, including the shark's fin and bird's nest soups.Bernard & Hall 1844, p. 140 Elliot and interpreter John Morrison later had a private meeting with Qishan, who did not sign the convention but agreed to put matters in abeyance until Chusan was evacuated. In the evening, the Nemesis launched a display of rockets and fireworks \\"for the amusement\\" of Qishan on shore.Bernard & Hall 1844, p. 141 In February 1841, Qishan sent a memorial to the emperor which reached Peking (Beijing) on 16 February. He covered four main topics, summarised as follows:Waley 1958, p. 134Mackenzie 1842, pp. 237‚Äì253 *The forts ‚Äì Located on small islands and having channels in the rear, foreign ships could easily blockade them and starve out the defenders. Canton can also be reached from other channels, not just the same route followed during peace time. *The guns ‚Äì Inadequate in number, with many obsolete and not in working order. They are placed at the front of the forts, leaving the sides undefended. *The troops ‚Äì The soldiers being used as marines are unused to ships and those normally employed for patrol duty are sometimes of poor quality. *The Cantonese people ‚Äì Even putting aside those considered \\"traitors\\", they have generally become so used to the foreigners that they no longer regard them as vastly different people and often get along with them. A small present such as a mechanical contrivance is enough to win over most of the people. = Renewed hostilities = Encampment where Elliot met Qishan During the meeting on 27 January, the Daoguang Emperor received a memorial Qishan sent on 8 January, reporting on the British capture of the Bogue forts. He instructed Qishan via the Grand Council: > To this display of rebelliousness, the only response can be to suppress them > and wipe them out. If they show no reasonableness there is no point in > trying to give them orders. You are to lead the commanders and officers and > spare no effort in exterminating them, to recover [the lost territory]. The order arrived on 9 February, but Qishan did not change course. In a memorial to the emperor on 14 February, he said he received the order \\"yesterday\\" to cover up his continued meetings with Elliot.Mao 2016, p. 193 In favour of a peaceful solution, Qishan defied orders to attack.Mao 2016, p. 194 One of the convention's terms was that the port of Canton was to be opened for trade within 10 days after the Chinese New Year, but no announcement for the opening appeared by 2 February. Elliot and Qishan met again on 11‚Äì12 February at Shetouwan near the Bogue. A British account described Qishan's demeanour: > There was an appearance of constraint about him, as if his mind was > downcast, and his heart burdened and heavy laden. He never indeed for a > moment lost his self-possession, or that dignified courtesy of manner which > no people can better assume than the Chinese of rank; but there was still > something undefinable in his bearing, which impressed upon all present the > conviction that something untoward had happened.Bernard & Hall 1844, p. 143 After negotiating for 12 hours, they reached a preliminary agreement, but Qishan asked for 10 days before he would sign it, which Elliot accepted. Under pressure, Qishan had abandoned open resistance in favour of delaying tactics. Commodore Bremer reported that at this time, Chinese troops and cannons were being mobilised around the Bogue. When Qishan returned to Canton on 13 February, there were two documents awaiting him. The first was an edict the emperor sent on 30 January, which stated that a large army would be sent to Canton and appointed Yang Fang as the new imperial commissioner, Yishan as General-in-Chief of Repressing Rebellion, and Longwen as an assistant regional commander. The second was a letter from Elliot with a draft agreement, requesting to meet promptly so they could sign it together. Qishan ran out of options. With his dismissal, he had little choice but to change tack and prepare to fight. On 16 February, Elliot reported that the British withdrew from Chusan and demanded that Qishan sign the agreement otherwise attacks would recommence. In an attempt to delay the British, Qishan claimed illness and needed time to recover. The Nemesis was dispatched to Canton to receive written ratification of the convention.Ouchterlony 1844, p. 109 On 19 February, the ship returned without any reply and came under fire from North Wangtong Island in the Bogue. Meanwhile, Qishan sent his intermediary Bao Peng to deliver a letter with a new concession that same day. Instead of lodging on \\"only a corner of Hong Kong\\", the British could \\"have the whole island\\". He instructed Bao: \\"Pay attention to the situation: hand it to them if they are respectful, if they are capricious, do not give it to them.\\" Bao arrived in Macao later that evening, announcing Qishan's refusal to sign the treaty and demanded more time. However, Elliot responded that fair means had been exhausted.Bingham, vol. 2, p. 47 The next day, Bao returned with the letter. The British captured the rest of the Bogue forts on 23‚Äì26 February, which allowed them to proceed towards Canton to force the opening of trade. As the fleet advanced up the Pearl River towards the city, they captured more forts in the Battle of First Bar (27 February) and Battle of Whampoa (2 March). After capturing Canton on 18 March, the resumption of trade was announced.The Chinese Repository, vol. 10, p. 233 = Dismissals = After leaving Canton on 12 March,The Chinese Repository, vol. 10, p. 184 Qishan stood trial at the Board of Punishments in Peking.Martin 1847, p. 66 He faced several charges, including giving \\"the barbarians Hongkong as a dwelling place\\", to which he claimed, \\"I pretended to do so from the mere force of circumstances, and to put them off for a time, but had no such serious intention.\\"Davis 1852, p. 50 The court denounced him as a traitor and sentenced him to death. But after being imprisoned for several months, he was allowed‚Äîwithout official rank‚Äîto deal with the British.Davis 1852, pp. 51‚Äì52 On 21 April, Lord Palmerston dismissed Elliot, considering the concessions to be inadequate. He felt that Elliot treated his instructions as \\"waste paper\\" and dismissed Hong Kong as \\"a barren island with hardly a house upon it\\".Morse 1910, p. 642 In May 1841, Major-General Henry Pottinger of the Bombay Army was appointed to replace Elliot. Pottinger was given reinforcements that enlarged the expedition to 25 warships and 12,000 men.Tsang 2004, p. 12 Many of the convention's terms were later added in the Treaty of Nanking in 1842: the cession of Hong Kong (Article 3), a six million dollar indemnity (Article 4), and both countries being on an equal footing (Article 11).Treaty of Nanking  Gallery  File:Convention of Chuenpee 2.pngPage two of the convention File:Convention of Chuenpee 3.pngPage three File:Convention of Chuenpee 4.pngPage four, signed by Charles Elliot  Notes   References  *Bernard, William Dallas; Hall, William Hutcheon (1844).

Under the Bourbons and the July Revolution Fran√ßois-Andr√© Isambert, 1848. Born in Aunay-sous-Auneau, Eure-et-Loir, Isambert studied law and, in 1818 (under the Second Restoration of the Bourbons), an attorney at the Cassation Court. As a member of the Chamber of Deputies, he worked for legislative and administrative reforms in the colonies, and was noted for his attacks on the Roman Catholic Church. He protested against the Ordinances of the year 1830 in the name of the bar, and thus sided with the Revolution and the July Monarchy. He went among the first to the town hall, where he was named by the provisional government director of the Bulletin de Lois. Named counsel at the cassation court on August 27, he edited the Constitutional Charter, and joined the Chamber of Deputies in October of that year.

In 1834, he founded the Soci√©t√© pour l'abolition de l'esclavage, a militant abolitionist organisation. After the Revolution of 1848, he was elected to the French National Assembly for the Eure-et-Loir department, and joined the Right in the Constituent Assembly, but wasn't reelected to the legislative. 1854, he converted to Protestantism; he died in Paris.

Peeples was one of three writers pegged to write a proposed second pilot for the series, and his script, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" (1965), was filmed and sold the series. He contributed the first aired episode of the animated Star Trek series, \\"Beyond the Farthest Star\\" (1973).https://web.archive.org/web/20050217014630/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue408/cassutt.html Peeples wrote a number of episodes for Filmation's live action Space Academy and Jason of Star Command series and wrote the script for their animated TV movie and seven first season episodes of the Flash Gordon series that resulted from it.

The parish stretches from the banks of the River Eden to the summits of the North Pennines where it borders Northumberland and includes the villages of Croglin and Newbiggin as well as the hamlets of Dale, Walmersyke, Ruckcroft and Longdales and part of the village of Armathwaite. Ainstable was the site of a Benedictine convent (the manor of \\"Nunnery\\"). This is said to date from the reign of William Rufus. However, Pevsner says that \\"the earliest reference is 1200. The nuns were so harassed by the Scots that in 1480 they had to reinvent their own charter, spuriously dating their foundation to 1089 and William Rufus.\\" After the closure of the monasteries, the convent building became a private home, held for many years by the Aglionby family, and is now a guesthouse. Eden Valley Woollen Mill is located in Ainstable itself. The former village pub, the New Crown Inn, has closed and been sold for redevelopment. In 2014 Eden District Council rejected a fiercely opposed plan to erect a wind turbine near to the village and the neighbouring village of Armathwaite.'We will continue our fight against turbines' The Cumberland News 25.7.2014 page 19.

The later ECMA-119 and ISO 9660 standards are based on revised HSF. Overview Compact Discs were originally developed for recording musical data, but soon were used for storing additional digital data types because they were equally effective for archival mass data storage. At first, every CD-ROM maker created their own format as there were no high-level standards, only the Yellow Book CD-ROM standard for the lowest level. There was a need for a standard for organizing data on compact disks into logical units such as files. In order to develop a CD-ROM file system standard (Z39.60 - Volume and File Structure of CDROM for Information Interchange), the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) set up Standards Committee SC EE (Compact Disc Data Format) in July 1985. In September/ October 1985 several companies invited experts to participate in the development of a working paper for such a standard. In November 1985, representatives of computer hardware manufacturers gathered at the High Sierra Hotel and Casino (currently called the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino) near Lake Tahoe, California. This group became known as the High Sierra Group (HSG). Present at the meeting were representatives from Apple Computer, AT&T;, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Hitachi, LaserData, Microware, Microsoft, 3M, Philips, Reference Technology Inc., Sony Corporation, TMS Inc., VideoTools (later Meridian), Xebec, and Yelick. The meeting report evolved from the Yellow Book CD-ROM standard for data CDs, which was so open ended it was leading to diversification and creation of many incompatible data storage methods. The High Sierra Group Proposal (HSGP) was released in May 1986. A draft version was submitted to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). With changes this led to the issue of the initial edition of the ECMA-119 standard in December 1986. The ECMA submitted their standard to the International Standards Organization (ISO) for fast tracking, where it was further refined into ISO 9660. For compatibility the second edition of ECMA-119 was revised to be equivalent to ISO 9660 in December 1987. https://web.archive.org/web/20161118181416/http://www.ecma- international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-119.pdf --> ISO 9660:1988 was published in 1988. ECMA-119 and ISO 9660 were needed because the HSF was geared primarily towards the needs of the US market. The international extensions are the bulk of the differences between the formats. In order not to create incompatibilities, NISO suspended further work on Z39.60, which had been adopted by NISO members on 28 May 1987. It was withdrawn before final approval, in favour of ISO 9660.

He was an enthusiastic balloonist and he was also particularly active in meteorology. He performed many meteorological and aviation experiments, designing and building his own equipment. He travelled widely, visiting Australia in his youth and later making many visits to USA ‚Äî crossing the Atlantic at least 50 times ‚Äî he travelled widely in Europe and visited Mexico, Russia, Siberia and Africa in pursuit of his interests. Patrick Alexander was respected by fellow aeronautical pioneers and knew Octave Chanute, the Wright brothers, Alberto Santos-Dumont, Lawrence Hargrave, Louis Bl√©riot, Henry Farman, Ferdinand von Zeppelin, Charles Rolls of Rolls-Royce and Major Baden Baden-Powell, as well as European heads of state and royalty. Patrick, a world traveller, arranged meetings between those interested in aeronautics, and gave lectures on the progress being made. Early years Planophore model airplane by Alphonse P√©naud, 1871 Henri Giffard balloon at the Tuileries, 1878 Alexander was born at Hern Villa, Belvedere, Erith, Kent. His mother was Harriotte Emma and his father was Andrew Alexander from Scotland. He had an elder brother, John Edmond who was three years older. His father, Andrew Alexander, was a civil engineer of some standing and a mechanical engineer. He was interested in aeronautics and was a founder member of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1866. He presented some papers to the society including \\"Power in Relation to Weight in Aerial Navigation\\". In 1875, he went to see Thomas Moy's Aerial Steamer at The Crystal Palace. This machine had many interesting design features and may have achieved a brief hop into the air; accounts vary. That year, Andrew Alexander became manager of the Cyclops works of Charles Cammell and Company in Sheffield, where he worked on the improvement of armour plate for warships. Andrew Alexander was a practical- minded man, unlikely to be prone to flights of fancy, yet at a time when many ridiculed the idea of heavier-than-air flight, he told Patrick he was sure that the problems of aviation would be solved. He was clearly a major influence on Patrick's life. In 1878, Patrick Alexander, doubtless encouraged by his father, built an elastic driven model aeroplane of the Penaud type. In the late summer of that year, Patrick was taken by his father to see the Paris Exhibition. One attraction was irresistible: the enormous hydrogen balloon of Henri Giffard, which was capable of taking 52 passengers at a time on a tethered ascent to . The experience left a deep impression on Alexander, then 11 years old. When Andrew Alexander left the Cyclops works, the Alexander family moved from Sheffield to Bath and Patrick decided on a career in the Merchant Navy. At sea The barque Minero On 1 April 1885, just 3 days after his 18th birthday, Patrick Alexander signed as an apprentice Merchant Navy officer. The very next day he sailed upon the Minero, a barque of 478 tones bound for Fremantle in Western Australia, a distance of in a vessel powered only by the wind. 60 days into the journey, while aloft helping with the sails, Patrick lost his grip and fell. As he hit the deck, he broke his leg. The ship was still three weeks away from port and there was little that could be done other than to strap Patrick into a bunk for the rest of the journey, letting the leg heal without expert attention. The Minero had left England with a crew short by one member. At Fremantle, two of the crew jumped ship, possibly encouraged by rumours of gold being found in the desert; replacement crewmen were hard to come by and only one could be found. The Minero set sail for Cossack and Port Walcott some to the North, seeking a cargo, probably of wool and pearl shell, for the return to London. Patrick was getting about with the aid of a crutch and, given the shortage of crew, he was helping as best he could. On 10 August, in rough weather on a wet and slippery deck, Alexander fell again and re-broke his injured leg. He was taken to Victoria Hospital at Geraldton. The Minero returned to London without him. Patrick returned to England; despite treatment, it was clear that his injuries would leave him lame for life. In 1886, while he was away from England, Patrick Alexander's elder brother died. The following year, Patrick's mother, Emma, died. In 1890, Patrick's father, Andrew, died at the age of 62. Now aged 23, Patrick was quite alone. Patrick's father had left him everything: almost ¬£60,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in .) At the time it was enough for a gentleman to live in some comfort. Patrick was to use his inheritance to pursue his various interests. Taking off Patrick Alexander became increasingly interested in aviation and related subjects, such as meteorology, parachutes, balloons, and propellers. By about 1888 he was working on wireless telegraphy. The French aviation historian Charles Dolfus recorded that Patrick Alexander was the first to suggest that wireless could be used for the automatic direction of airships and aeroplanes and said Patrick Alexander was a \\"Pioneer of Space\\". On 9 June 1891, Patrick Alexander made a gas balloon ascent in the company of aeronaut Griffith Brewer: this was the first of a number of balloon ascents that would lead to his becoming a licensed balloonist. Patrick ordered a three-man (some say five-man) balloon from balloon manufacturer Percival G. Spencer, naming his balloon Queen of the West. Throughout the summer of 1892, Patrick and his friend Philip Braham made a number of flights. They collected meteorological observations and measurements and took photographs. Their adventures were recorded in a number of local newspapers. Also in 1891, Patrick Alexander acquired an aperture refractor telescope which was erected in Bath. The telescope was a substantial instrument, which together with its mounting, must have weighed several tons. The telescope was fully equipped for astronomical observations and Patrick was a member of the Royal Astronomical Society until 1921. Although he enjoyed showing his telescope to friends and distinguished visitors, any interest he had in astronomy was overshadowed by his other passions; the telescope was probably a scientific toy. Barry Bellinger suggests that the telescope was used to track pilot balloons released into the air, before releasing any main balloons; however, a telescope of this size and type seems unsuited to such a task. In 1893, Patrick Alexander ordered a balloon of capacity from Percival Spencer. At the time, C.G. Spencer and Sons' largest advertised balloon was of and when it was made it attracted much public interest. Capable of lifting 12 passengers, it was one of the largest balloons yet made. Alexander named her the Majestic. In 1894, Patrick took it to Germany where he conducted scientific ascents that excited interest among German scientists and the lay public, as well as that of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Ever since the first balloon ascent by the Montgolfier Brothers in 1783, it had been realised that for balloons to be really useful, they had to be navigable. Patrick Alexander applied his mind to this problem of airship propulsion. In 1893 and 1894 he filed a number of patents. His ideas included reciprocating oars and an adjustable-pitch propeller that resembled a pair of fans. One patent includes a means of heating the gas in the balloon envelope by using piped steam, the steam pipe also served to support the balloon in the shape of a parachute in the event of the balloon being burst or punctured. None of Patrick‚Äôs ideas ever came to anything; but throughout his life, he never lost faith in the practicality of airships. In Bath Patrick Alexander set up the first of a series of workshops. His most prestigious workshop was The Mount at Batheaston purchased in 1900 and here he had a gas supply brought into the garden and a balloon inflation valve installed. Town gas, although not as light as Hydrogen, was readily available and very much less expensive; it was, of course, highly flammable. His workshops were fully equipped and employed several people, there he designed and manufactured experimental balloons and meteorological instruments. Patrick Alexander joined the Aero clubs of Berlin, Paris and America and, at one time, that of Austria. In 1900 the first Zeppelin made its maiden flight, observed by Alexander. The Zeppelin was launched from a floating assembly hall on Lake Constance; Patrick observed from a motor boat in order to be as close as possible. Later that year, at the invitation of the Berlin Metrological Institute, he made a flight in the world's largest balloon, a non-dirigible with a capacity of . The objective was to make metrological measurements and break the existing endurance records. It is indicative of the esteem in which Patrick was held that he, a non-German, was offered a place. The balloon was equipped against every eventuality and stocked with rations for 20 days. The balloon took off on 27 September, just before 6 pm. The same evening, their trailing rope became stuck in trees and gusty winds caused the crew to lose control. In the dark it was decided to release the gas and land the balloon. The ambitious expedition ended just from the start. Patrick Alexander was very interested in the development of heavier-than-air flying machines. Early in the 1890s, he travelled to Germany to meet Otto Lilienthal who was experimenting with gliders, and he continued to study ideas from a wide variety of sources. In 1896, Hiram Stevens Maxim came close to achieving flight when his huge steam-powered machine briefly lifted from the rails that also restrained it. Patrick was in contact with Octave Chanute and others experimenting with flight. In the USA, sometime before 1903, Patrick visited Samuel Pierpont Langley whose successful models had attracted much attention. At Christmas 1902 he visited the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk. On hearing that Patrick Alexander was planning a return trip to the USA in October 1903, the Wright brothers, not known for welcoming interruptions to their work, said they would be happy to meet him. However, Patrick missed a crucial telegram and never received their message. Patrick must have been most disappointed to have missed the opportunity to witness the first flights of the Wright Flyer on 17 December 1903. Aldershot in Hampshire was an insignificant village until, in 1854, it was selected as the home of the British Army. It was in Aldershot that the army established the Army Balloon section. In June 1904 the American born aviation pioneer Samuel Franklin Cody came to Aldershot to test his kites. There, in collaboration with the Army, he worked on balloons, kites and aeroplanes. That same year Patrick Alexander moved to nearby Mytchett in Surrey where he was involved with the Army Balloon section. He shared a house with Cody who later went on to become the first man in England to fly an aeroplane. 1905 was a year of public generosity. Chard in Somerset had been the location of some remarkable aviation experiments by John Stringfellow in 1848: he constructed a model aeroplane that is claimed to have achieved the first ever power flight. Some of the relics of these experiments were eventually bought for the Washington Museum. Patrick Alexander obtained and had restored at his expense, Stringfellow's earlier models and presented them to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Also, Patrick offered his telescope - the 8\\" refractor - to the War Office. The offer included the cost of construction of a suitable observatory to house it. The offer was accepted and a site was chosen. In December 1906 the Aldershot Observatory was officially opened, the opening ceremony was attended by several high-ranking officials and guests from Aldershot civic council, and Patrick Alexander himself. In January 1910, Patrick Alexander issued the conditions of a ¬£1,000 Alexander Award, a prize that he would offer for the development of a lightweight engine suitable for aviation. The prize was offered through the auspices of the Aerial League of which Alexander was a founding member and the testing would be performed by the National Physical Laboratory.Motor Engineering.

First World War With the outbreak of war, Patrick Alexander was keen to make himself useful. He was soon in America again where he aided British propaganda by making statements in the American press. He was well known to New York journalists who reported his views at length and naturally Patrick expressed his view on the importance of aviation in the conflict. In 1917 he was given a job by the newly formed Air Ministry at the Metrological Office at Falmouth; here he worked until the end of the war. Teaching At the end of the First World War, Patrick Alexander was fifty years old and his inheritance was all but gone. Even his prodigious energies had been unable to keep up with the developments in aviation that had taken place during the conflict. He spent the rest of his life at the Imperial Service College, Windsor. There he taught students the basics of aeronautical principles. Legacy Patrick Alexander died on 7 July 1943, almost penniless ‚Äî having given most of his money away. Today, he is not well known; having failed to make any singular, lasting contribution to aviation and there being just a few modest memorials to his name. His primary contribution to the history of aviation was that through his tireless efforts, many journeys, writings, public speeches, and generous donations he was responsible for collecting and disseminating ideas across nations and continents without which development in the field would have proceeded more slowly. He was a generous man -- generous with his time, his intellect and with his money. An inheritance and his business ability made him wealthy, but financial success meant little to him. He was driven by native curiosity and ambition, and yet he was always supportive of the efforts of others, often making generous financial contributions, and was not jealous of their achievements.

The company was founded in 1985 by Alon Cohen and Lior Haramaty, who patented the first Voice over IP audio transceiver. VocalTec has supplied major customers such as Deutsche Telekom, Telecom Italia, and many others. History VocalTec was founded in 1985 by Alon Cohen and Lior Haramaty while still serving together in the IDF, and was officially incorporated in 1989. Its initial operations were devoted to research, development and commercialization of products which provided audio and voice capabilities to personal computers and over computer networks. Cohen and Haramaty developed and manufactured a PC sound card (SpeechBoard TM) that was sold mainly to the local market for various uses such as educational, advertising, radio broadcasting and to the visually-impaired community in Israel with a unique Text to Speech software enabling blind people to use a computer in Hebrew as well as English. As Text to Speech was not available in Hebrew at all, and rarely available in English, they developed both from scratch, utilizing Haramaty's voice, and a user- update-able dictionary of words that was periodically merged between all users. TechTrends, November 1990, Volume 35, Issue 6, pp 29-34 Other projects during the mid to late 80s included Audio editing software, external audio card (mainly for laptops) that was connected the parallel (printer) port, standalone digital audio playback device for frozen desert trucks, multimedia presentation with audio (based on IBM's Story Board presentation software), a system for the disabled (mute) with text to speech which enabled \\"talking\\" and conducting phone calls, broadcasting recording, editing and transfer system for offshore radio station, automated IVR information systems, voice messaging over LAN and many other projects utilizing digital audio. In 1990, technology entrepreneur Elon Ganor joined the company to manage International Sales & Marketing, and later on was nominated as CEO. In 1993, VocalTec introduced The CAT to the international market, a peripheral device that provided audio capability for personal computers. In 1993 and 1994, the company introduced additional products, including CATBoard, a full duplex audio card, an internal audio card that provided high level compression. Net sales of these products totaled approximately $0.3 million, $0.4 Million and $0.2 Million in 1993, 1994 and the first nine months of 1995, respectively, and the Company did not expect to recognize significant revenues from sales of these products in the future. In early 1993 the company partnered with ClassX, a group of innovative teenagers lead by Ofer Shem-Tov (a childhood friend of Haramaty) to develop MS Windows audio drivers and related software. ClassX was acquired by VocalTec in 1993 and became the core of VocalTec's software and network development team, and the company recruited Rami Amit as a hardware engineer (also a childhood friend of Haramaty and Shem-Tov). Despite Ganor's initial objection, VocalTec's management decided to shift the company's focus to software, and in 1993 VocalChat was born, a software that enabled voice communication from one PC to another on a local and wide area network, and VocalChat LAN/WAN, hardware and software products that enable real-time voice conversations over local and wide area computer networks. The software was developed, based on Cohen & Haramaty's Audio Transceiver design, by a group of developers including Ofer Shem Tov, Ofer Kahana, Elad Sion (died young in a car accident), Dror Tirosh, Rami Amit and others. The software was presented in Atlanta in May 1993 at the Network InterOp trade show.

The process includes all the activities needed to maintain a productive workforce, such as field service management, human resource management, performance and training management, data collection, recruiting, budgeting, forecasting, scheduling and analytics. Workforce management provides a common set performance-based tools and software to support corporate management, front-line supervisors, store managers and workers across manufacturing, distribution, transportation, and retail operations. It is sometimes referred to as HRM systems, or Workforce asset management, or part of ERP systems.  Definition  As workforce management has developed from a traditional approach of staff scheduling to improve time management, it has become more integrated and demand-oriented to optimize the scheduling of staff. Besides the two core aspects of demand-orientation and optimization, workforce management may also incorporate: *forecasting of workload and required staff *involvement of employees into the scheduling process *management of working times and accounts *analysis and monitoring of the entire process. The starting point is a clear definition of the work required through engineered standards and optimal methods for performing each task as efficiently and safely as possible. Based on this foundation and demand-based forecasts, workers are scheduled, tasks are assigned, performance is measured, feedback is provided and incentives are computed and paid. In addition, online training is provided along with supervisor-based coaching to bring all workers up to required levels of proficiency. Workforce management is a complete approach designed to make workforce as productive as possible, reduce labor costs, and improve customer service. =Field service management= Workforce management also uses the process of field service management in order to have oversight of company's resources not used on company property. Examples include: *Demand management ‚Äì to help forecast work orders to plan the number and expertise of staff that will be needed *Workforce scheduler ‚Äì using predefined rules to automatically optimise the schedule and use of resources (people, parts, vehicles) *Workforce dispatcher ‚Äì automatically assigning work orders within predefined zones to particular technicians *Mobile solutions ‚Äì allowing dispatchers and technicians to communicate in real time. =Market growth= In the 1980s and 1990s, entrepreneurs focused on topics such as supply chain management, production planning systems or enterprise resource planning. As cost pressures have increased, managers have turned their attention to human resources issues. In all personnel-intensive industries, workforce management has become an important strategic element in corporate management. The process has experienced growth in all sectors, including healthcare. The rise of the gig economy has also gone hand in hand with the rise of workforce management preactices. =Mobile workforce management= As our society continues to adopt new technologies such as smartphones and enterprise mobility tools, more companies are allowing employees to become mobile. Mobile workforce management refers to activities used to schedule the employees working outside the company premises. It helps distribute workforce efficiently across various departments in an institution. Software Workforce management solutions can be deployed enterprise-wide and through mobile platforms. While special software is commonly used in numerous areas such as ERP (enterprise resource planning), SLM (service lifecycle management), CRM (customer relationship management) and HR (human resources) management, the management of the workforce is often still handled using spreadsheet programs or time recording. This often results in expensive overtime, non-productive idle times, high fluctuation rates, poor customer service and opportunity costs being incurred. By using a software solution for demand-oriented workforce management, planners can optimize staffing by creating schedules that at all times conform to the forecasted requirements. At the same time, a workforce management solution helps users to observe all relevant legislations, local agreements and the contracts of individual employees ‚Äì including work-life balance guidelines. A key aspect of workforce management is scheduling. This is achieved by establishing likely demand by analyzing historical data (such as the number and duration of customer contacts, sales figures, check-out transactions or orders to be handled). Many workforce management systems also offer manual adjustment capabilities. The calculated forecast values are then converted into actual staffing requirements by means of an algorithm that is adjusted to the particular use case. The algorithm itself is based on the work of Erlang though most modern adaptations of workforce management have shifted towards a richer state management, and optimizations to the original idea. Current and future staffing requirements, short-term peak loads, availabilities, holidays, budget allowances, skills, labour law-related restrictions, as well as wage and contractual terms have to be integrated into the planning process to guarantee optimal staff deployment. In the workforce management process, the integration of employees is an important factor. In several workforce management systems, employees can log in their availability or planned absences and they can bid for specific shifts so long as they have the necessary skills for the activities planned for these shifts. =Delivery= The three methods of delivery for contact center technologies are on-premises solution, hosted or cloud-based computing. *An on-premises system is one in which hardware and software must be physically installed, deployed and maintained at the business. All equipment is purchased up front. It is traditionally associated with large enterprises with the budget and the space to acquire the capabilities deemed necessary, and the personnel available to configure and modify systems. *A hosted system relies on an outside service provider. Software is purchased and installed in a data center on either physical or virtual servers that may be owned or leased by the business. Implementation is similar to an on-premises solution, but the cost is typically lower because hardware need not be purchased. However, the business must pay an initial provisioning fee as well as a monthly fee for the rental or usage of the hosting center‚Äôs equipment and personnel. *Cloud computing converts such physical resources as processors and storage into Internet resources. By developing applications in a virtual environment, a company‚Äôs computing infrastructure is treated as a utility service, and the company pays only for the time and capacity it needs. Cloud eliminates issues such as computing capacity, physical space, bandwidth and storage.

The retail space is on two levels, three in the case of the two pre-existing buildings (former C&A; and former Littlewoods). The Haymarket Shopping Centre boasts around 65 outlets, a bus station, a two-stage theatre, and Haymarket House (a three-story office block atop of the rooftop car park), and had previously boasted two nightclubs (located either side of the clock tower entrance), Dino's restaurant (adjacent to the theatre entrance) and two enclosed foot bridges (one crossing Charles Street in to Kildare Street and the other crossing Humberstone Gate linking to Lewis's department store). Four wide pedestrian access points are located on the streets Haymarket (clock tower), Belgrave Gate, Charles Street and Humberstone Gate. Noticeably, there are no doors so no bottlenecks occur during busy periods. Some of the outlets can only be accessed from the street and some can only be accessed from the mall. The larger stores can be accessed either way.

Retrieved 9 November 2019 Other major buildings originally on the site included a tram depot and the Leicestershire Horse Repository.OS Map of Leicester, 1880s Construction of the Haymarket Centre began in 1971 of red brick, linking Littlewoods and C&A; (located 120 metres apart). The centre was opened on 4 June 1973. It is six stories high; levels 1-2 are for retail, levels 3-4 are for car parking, levels 4-6 are Haymarket House and levels 2 plus for the theatre. Level 2 balconies feature on Humberstone Gate and outside the theatre. In 1993, Lewis's department store was demolished prompting the removal of the foot bridge linking Lewis's and the Haymarket Shopping Centre. In 1996, the Haymarket Shopping Centre closed for refurbishment. The general colours of brown and beige were replaced with white, a new glass roof was built, and the escalators and staircase switched sides and were replaced with new ones. The toilets were moved from above the clock tower entrance to above the Charles Street entrance. The children's ladybirds ride was removed. The spiral road to the high level car park was demolished in favour of a straight ramp, with access being moved from Charles Street to Belgrave Gate. In a separate, publicly funded project by the Leicester City Council, a row of shops was purchased on Charles Street and demolished in order to build the Haymarket Bus Station. In 1997, the foot bridge crossing Charles Street was closed; it was removed in 2007. In May 2006 it was announced that Woolworths were to vacate their unit in the centre in early 2007 after being \\"made an offer they could not refuse\\" by the landlords. In October 2007 Peacocks opened in the former Woolworths unit. The bus station was demolished in 2015, along with two food outlets (McIndians and Subway) and the Bohemian Public House on the corner of Charles Street and Belgrave Gate in order to build a larger bus station. Facilities =Stores= Notable stores past and present include Littlewoods (including Index), C&A;, Somerfield (later The Co-operative Food), HMV, British Home Stores, Poundworld, Allders, Bejam, MK One, Habitat and Woolworths. Stores currently occupying units include: Ryman, T.K. Maxx, Holland & Barrett, B&M;, Primark, H&M;, Peacocks (retailer), Heron Foods, Matalan, Tesco Express.{https://haymarketshoppingcentre.com/stores/} First Leicester travel shop is also located near the Charles Street entrance. =Haymarket Theatre= Leicester City Council purchased a 99-year lease of the theatre in 1974. The theatre operated until 2007 when it was closed and replaced by the newly built Curve Theatre in Leicester's Cultural Quarter. The theatre was reopened in early 2018. Located on Belgrave Gate at the front of the entrance to the Haymarket Theatre is The Metal Tree sculpture by Hubert Dalwood ARA. It was unveiled in 1974 and used to be the only piece of major abstract sculpture in Leicester City Centre. =Nightclubs= To the left of the Clock Tower entrance was the entrance to the George Bar. This took its name from the George Hotel that had previously stood on this site. In 2001 it was called U R Zeus. It opened on 23 September 2005 as Niche, followed in November 2007 by Ice. It closed in 2008 and on 30 May 2009, it opened as the D9 Nightclub. To the right side of the Clock Tower entrance was the entrance to a nightclub which was located on the first and second floors. This has now been converted to ordinary retail space and is currently occupied by Costa Coffee. This was first known as Bailey's Nightspot, then changed to The King of Clubs in 1980. It subsequently changed its name to Mr Kiesa's Discoth√®que, after owner Martin Kiesa. Bailey's hosted many music and comedy acts such as Tommy Cooper, Bernard Manning, Mud, Slade, Gary Glitter (March 1978), Showaddywaddy, The Three Degrees and The Drifters. =Transport= Opening in mid 2016, the Haymarket Bus Station has been rebuilt and expanded and now forms a major transport hub for the north of the city centre.

The message is encrypted with some block cipher algorithm in CBC mode to create a chain of blocks such that each block depends on the proper encryption of the previous block. This interdependence ensures that a change to any of the plaintext bits will cause the final encrypted block to change in a way that cannot be predicted or counteracted without knowing the key to the block cipher. To calculate the CBC-MAC of message , one encrypts in CBC mode with zero initialization vector and keeps the last block. The following figure sketches the computation of the CBC-MAC of a message comprising blocks m_1m_2cdotsm_x using a secret key and a block cipher : Image:CBC-MAC structure (en).svg Security with fixed and variable-length messages If the block cipher used is secure (meaning that it is a pseudorandom permutation), then CBC-MAC is secure for fixed-length messages.M. Bellare, J. Kilian and P. Rogaway. The security of the cipher block chaining message authentication code. JCSS 61(3):362‚Äì399, 2000. However, by itself, it is not secure for variable-length messages. Thus, any single key must only be used for messages of a fixed and known length. This is because an attacker who knows the correct message-tag (i.e. CBC-MAC) pairs for two messages (m, t) and (m', t') can generate a third message m whose CBC-MAC will also be t'. This is simply done by XORing the first block of m' with and then concatenating with this modified m'; i.e., by making m = m  [(m_1' oplus t)  m_2'  dots  m_x']. When computing the MAC for the message m, it follows that we compute the MAC for in the usual manner as , but when this value is chained forwards to the stage computing E_{K_text{MAC}}(m_1' oplus t) we will perform an exclusive OR operation with the value derived for the MAC of the first message. The presence of that tag in the new message means it will cancel, leaving no contribution to the MAC from the blocks of plain text in the first message : E_{K_text{MAC}}(m_1' oplus t oplus t) = E_{K_text{MAC}}(m_1') and thus the tag for m is t'. This problem cannot be solved by adding a message-size block to the end. There are three main ways of modifying CBC-MAC so that it is secure for variable length messages: 1) Input-length key separation; 2) Length-prepending; 3) Encrypt last block. In such a case, it may also be recommended to use a different mode of operation, for example, CMAC or HMAC to protect the integrity of variable-length messages. = Length prepending = One solution is to include the length of the message in the first block;ISO/IEC 9797-1:1999 Information technology ‚Äì Security techniques ‚Äì Message Authentication Codes (MACs) ‚Äì Part 1: Mechanisms using a block cipher, clause 6.1.3 Padding Method 3 in fact CBC-MAC has been proven secure as long as no two messages that are prefixes of each other are ever used and prepending the length is a special case of this.C.

Compared to the other discussed methods of extending CBC-MAC to variable-length messages, encrypt-last-block has the advantage of not needing to know the length of the message until the end of the computation. Computation of CBC-MAC Encrypt-last- block. Attack methods As with many cryptographic schemes, na√Øve use of ciphers and other protocols may lead to attacks being possible, reducing the effectiveness of the cryptographic protection (or even rendering it useless). We present attacks which are possible due to using the CBC-MAC incorrectly.Why I hate CBC-MAC by Matthew D. Green =Using the same key for encryption and authentication= One common mistake is to reuse the same key for CBC encryption and CBC-MAC. Although a reuse of a key for different purposes is a bad practice in general, in this particular case the mistake leads to a spectacular attack: Suppose Alice has sent to Bob the cipher text blocks C = C_1  C_2  dots  C_n. During the transmission process, Eve can tamper with any of the C_1 , dots , C_{n-1} cipher-text blocks and adjust any of the bits therein as she chooses, provided that the final block, C_n, remains the same. We assume, for the purposes of this example and without loss of generality, that the initialization vector used for the encryption process is a vector of zeroes. When Bob receives the message, he will first decrypt the message by reversing the encryption process which Alice applied, using the cipher text blocks C=C_1  C_2  cdots  C_n. The tampered message, delivered to Bob in replacement of Alice's original, is C'=C_1'  dots  C_{n-1}'  C_n. Bob first decrypts the message received using the shared secret key to obtain corresponding plain text. Note that all plain text produced will be different from that which Alice originally sent, because Eve has modified all but the last cipher text block. In particular, the final plain text, P_n', differs from the original, P_n, which Alice sent; although C_n is the same, C_{n-1}' ot = C_{n-1}, so a different plain text P_n' is produced when chaining the previous cipher text block into the exclusive-OR after decryption of C_n: P_n' = C_{n-1}' oplus E_K^{-1}(C_n). It follows that Bob will now compute the authentication tag using CBC-MAC over all the values of plain text which he decoded. The tag for the new message, t', is given by: : t' = E_K(P_n' oplus E_K(P_{n-1}' oplus E_K( dots oplus E_K(P_1')))) Notice that this expression is equal to : t' = E_K(P_n' oplus C_{n-1}') which is exactly C_n: : t' = E_K(C_{n-1}' oplus E_K^{-1}(C_n) oplus C_{n-1}') = E_K(E_K^{-1}(C_n)) = C_n and it follows that t' = C_n = t. Therefore, Eve was able to modify the cipher text in transit (without necessarily knowing what plain text it corresponds to) such that an entirely different message, P', was produced, but the tag for this message matched the tag of the original, and Bob was unaware that the contents had been modified in transit. By definition, a Message Authentication Code is broken if we can find a different message (a sequence of plain-text pairs P') which produces the same tag as the previous message, , with P ot = P'. It follows that the message authentication protocol, in this usage scenario, has been broken, and Bob has been deceived into believing Alice sent him a message which she did not produce. If, instead, we use different keys for the encryption and authentication stages, say K_1 and K_2, respectively, this attack is foiled. The decryption of the modified cipher-text blocks C_i' obtains some plain text string P_i'. However, due to the MAC's usage of a different key K_2, we cannot \\"undo\\" the decryption process in the forward step of the computation of the message authentication code so as to produce the same tag; each modified P_i' will now be encrypted by K_2 in the CBC-MAC process to some value mathrm{MAC}_i ot = C_i'. This example also shows that a CBC-MAC cannot be used as a collision-resistant one- way function: given a key it is trivial to create a different message which \\"hashes\\" to the same tag. =Allowing the initialization vector to vary in value= When encrypting data using a block cipher in cipher block chaining (or another) mode, it is common to introduce an initialization vector to the first stage of the encryption process. It is typically required that this vector be chosen randomly (a nonce) and that it is not repeated for any given secret key under which the block cipher operates. This provides semantic security, by means of ensuring the same plain text is not encrypted to the same cipher text, allowing an attacker to infer a relationship exists. When computing a message authentication code, such as by CBC-MAC, the use of an initialization vector is a possible attack vector. In the operation of a ciphertext block chaining cipher, the first block of plain text is mixed with the initialization vector using an exclusive OR (P_1 oplus IV). The result of this operation is the input to the block cipher for encryption. However, when performing encryption and decryption, we are required to send the initialization vector in plain text - typically as the block immediately preceding the first block of cipher text - such that the first block of plain text can be decrypted and recovered successfully. If computing a MAC, we will also need to transmit the initialization vector to the other party in plain text so that they can verify the tag on the message matches the value they have computed. If we allow the initialization vector to be selected arbitrarily, it follows that the first block of plain text can potentially be modified (transmitting a different message) while producing the same message tag. Consider a message M_1 = P_1  P_2  dots. In particular, when computing the message tag for CBC-MAC, suppose we choose an initialization vector IV_1 such that computation of the MAC begins with E_K(IV_1 oplus P_1). This produces a (message, tag) pair (M_1, T_1). Now produce the message M_2 = P_1'  P_2  dots. For each bit modified in P_1', flip the corresponding bit in the initialization vector to produce the initialization vector IV_1'. It follows that to compute the MAC for this message, we begin the computation by E_K(P_1' oplus IV_1'). As bits in both the plain text and initialization vector have been flipped in the same places, the modification is cancelled in this first stage, meaning the input to the block cipher is identical to that for M_1. If no further changes are made to the plain text, the same tag will be derived despite a different message being transmitted. If the freedom to select an initialization vector is removed and all implementations of CBC-MAC fix themselves on a particular initialization vector (often the vector of zeroes, but in theory, it could be anything provided all implementations agree), this attack cannot proceed. To sum up, if the attacker is able to set the IV that will be used for MAC verification, he can perform arbitrary modification of the first data block without invalidating the MAC. = Using predictable initialization vector = Sometimes IV is used as a counter to prevent message replay attacks. However, if the attacker can predict what IV will be used for MAC verification, he or she can replay previously observed message by modifying the first data block to compensate for the change in the IV that will be used for the verification. For example, if the attacker has observed message M_1 = P_1  P_2  dots with IV_1 and knows IV_2, he can produce M_1' = (P_1 oplus IV_1 oplus IV_2) P_2  dots that will pass MAC verification with IV_2. The simplest countermeasure is to encrypt the IV before using it (i.e., prepending IV to the data). Alternatively MAC in CFB mode can be used, because in CFB mode the IV is encrypted before it is XORed with the data. Another solution (in case protection against message replay attacks is not required) is to always use a zero vector IV.Introduction to Modern Cryptography, Second Edition by Jonathan Katz and Yehuda Lindell Note that the above formula for M_1' becomes M_1' = (P_1 oplus 0 oplus 0) P_2  dots = P_1  P_2  dots = M_1. So since M_1 and M_1' are the same message, by definition they will have the same tag. This is not a forgery, rather the intended use of CBC-MAC. Standards that define the algorithm FIPS PUB 113 Computer Data Authentication is a (now obsolete) U.S. government standard that specified the CBC-MAC algorithm using DES as the block cipher. The CBC-MAC algorithm is equivalent to ISO/IEC 9797-1 MAC Algorithm 1.

The tassel, leaf, silk, cob in husks, and the stalk are the parts of corn. According to the Michigan Department of Agriculture, \\"corn can be made into fuel, abrasives, solvents, charcoal, animal feed, bedding for animals, insulation, adhesives, and more. The kernel is used as oil, bran, starch, glutamates, animal feed, and solvents. The silk is combined with other parts of the corn plant to be used as part of animal feed, silage, and fuels. Husks are made into dolls and used as filling materials. The stalk is used to make paper, wallboard, silage, syrup, and rayon (artificial silk).\\"Michigan Department of Agriculture History Corn has long been used in manufacturing. There were a number innovations in the United States in the early 1900s. For example, Henry Ford's conceptual Model U car featured tires with corn-based filler and a corn-based fabric roof. The Corn Palace, a building in Mitchell, South Dakota, is decorated with murals and designs made from corn and other grains. Materials =Husks= The outer husk of corn can be used to make corn husk dolls, txalaparta musical instruments, and other crafts. Husks are used as the wrapper for tamales. It is also used in South American countries as a cigarette rolling 'paper'. =Corncobs= Corncobs, the core of corn ears, are very absorbent. They have been used to make inexpensive smoking pipes, and to transport various materials. Ground corn cobs make an effective blasting media, are friendly to the environment, and delicate while maintaining abrasive capacity. Corncobs are increasingly being used as a low-cost, environmentally friendly insulation material for houses. =Cornstarch= Goodyear BioTRED tires are made using a biologic polymer derived from cornstarch as the filler. =Corn kernels= Corn kernel burning stoves have found increasing popularity following the rise in natural gas and fuel oil prices. Large corn furnaces are capable of heating any size building, and fueling generators to produce electricity. Corn kernels are a natural pellet, which makes corn less expensive and more readily available than wood byproduct pellets.

Dubbed the \\"white brother with soul\\", Messina was one of the most prolific guitarists in Motown Records' in-house studio band, the Funk Brothers. Messina started playing guitar as an adolescent. By his mid- twenties, Messina was playing in the ABC Television studio band, accompanying guests that included Sonny Stitt, Charlie Parker, Stan Getz, Jack Teagarden, Lee Konitz, Jimmy Giuffre, Pepper Adams, Donald Byrd, Eddie (LockJaw) Davis, Frank Rosolino and Dizzy Gillespie, among others. Also while at ABC, he played on the nationally televised Soupy Sales Show alongside notable guests such as Miles Davis and Charlie Parker. In 1958, Motown Records founder Berry Gordy recruited Messina for his Hitsville U.S.A. studio musicians group, known as the Funk Brothers. In the 1960s and early 1970s, they recorded the instrumentals for hundreds of Motown hit records. During this time, Messina worked with performers such as Diana Ross & the Supremes, the Temptations, Marvin Gaye, the Four Tops, Stevie Wonder, and Smokey Robinson & the Miracles. Among Messina's performances are hits such as \\"Dancing in the Street\\" (Martha & the Vandellas, 1964), \\"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch)\\" (Four Tops, 1965), and \\"Your Precious Love\\" (Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell, 1967). Messina stopped playing guitar for 30 years after Berry Gordy took his Motown operation to Los Angeles in 1972: \\"I just had no interest\\", he said.Interviewed for Hitsville Us Eh!, a Canadian documentary film about Motown, released in 2017. Messina is the creator of an alternative music technique known as The Interval Study Method, which uses the chromatic and diatonic scales to create music. He still resides in Detroit, where he performs as a jazz musician. On March 21, 2013, the Funk Brothers were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame. The Funk Brothers were also the subject of the 2002 documentary Standing in the Shadows of Motown. Among Messina's influences are Charlie Parker, Les Paul, and George Barnes. In his early days, Messina played a Gibson L5 guitar, and later moved over to an early 1960s Fender Telecaster with a Jazzmaster neck strung with flatwound strings.

The Guildhall once acted as the town hall for the city until the current one was commissioned in 1876. It is located in the old walled city, on a street now known as Guildhall Lane. It was used first as the meeting place for the Guild of Corpus Christi and then later for the more formal Corporation of Leicester. The hall was used for many purposes, including council meetings, feasts, as a courtroom, and for theatrical performances; the ultimatum given to the city during English Civil War was discussed here. It is a Grade I listed building, and the surrounding area, also including the Cathedral of St Martin's, is a conservation area, one of three in Leicester. History An angel on the ornate wooden fireplace inside the Mayor's Parlour The Great Hall was built around 1390 as the meeting place of the Guild of Corpus Christi; the guild was a group of businessmen and gentry who had religious connections. The Guildhall was used for banquets, festivals, and as a home for a priest who prayed for the souls of Guild members in the nearby St Martin's Church. The Corporation of Leicester bought the Guildhall by the end of the 14th century. It is reputed that William Shakespeare appeared here in the late 16th century. In recognition of this, the television company, Maya Vision, brought the Royal Shakespeare Company to perform at the Guildhall as part of its 2003 series for the BBC, In Search of Shakespeare, written and narrated by the historian, Michael Wood.In Search of Shakespeare, PBS, Retrieved 8 April 2016 Part of the Shakespeare legend is that Shakespeare first came across the tale of King Leir whilst appearing at the Guildhall and this inspired him to write his own play King Lear. There is, however, no actual evidence to support this, although the legend of King Leir is associated with Leicester. During the English Civil War the Mayor and corporation received a demand from Prince Rupert for ¬£2,000. The decision was made at the Guildhall to offer a loan of ¬£500 and made an appeal to King Charles I. In May 1645 the King in attempt to divert attention away from Oxford positioned an army of 6,000 men outside the city walls on 29 May 1645. Again important decisions regarding the fate of the city were to be decided in the Guildhall. On 30 May 1645 the Royalist Army made demand after demand to the city, who played for time. In the end Prince Rupert attacked at 3:00 pm. The City walls were breached, and the last stand made by the defenders outside the Guildhall and St Martins. The Royalists then entered the Guildhall looting the town's archives, and mace and seal. The Royalist victory was reversed a couple of weeks later with the defeat at Naseby. Room at Leicester in which Shakespeare is said to have Acted before Queen Elizabeth by Alice Mary HobsonWomen Painters of the World on Project Gutenberg Records also show that entertainment expenses were paid for such items as wine, beer for Oliver Cromwell. Although this does not prove Oliver Cromwell stayed at the Guildhall, it is highly probable that he visited several times. The coat of arms of King Charles I can be seen today inside the Mayor's Parlour. The Guildhall library in England, which includes the New Testament in Greek from the 15th century, was established in 1632, when the town library was moved into the east wing of the building. Leicester's first police force had its station in the Guildhall from 1836. The Corporation moved to the new Leicester Town Hall in 1876. Apart from the police station, it was later used as a school. However, the building was becoming increasingly dilapidated, and by the 1920s there were plans to demolish the building. After the intervention of the Leicestershire Archaeological and Historical Society, the council began restoration work on the building, finishing it in 1926, when the Guildhall was opened as a museum. At a press conference in the Guildhall on 4 February 2013, it was confirmed that archaeologists had discovered Richard III's remain in the nearby Greyfriars 'Car Park'. The former Alderman Newton's Greencoat School building, close to the grave site, opened as a permanent Richard III museum, on 24 July 2014. Present day The Guildhall is used as a performance venue as well as a museum. Ghosts With five reported ghosts, the Guildhall is reputedly Leicester's most haunted building. Because of its reported hauntings, it has appeared on various TV programmes, including being investigated on the television show Most Haunted.

She was known as the \\"Mother of the Kindergarten.\\" Sketch of Susan E. Blow by Marguerite Martyn, 1909 Early life The eldest of nine children, Susan Blow was the daughter of Henry Taylor Blow and Minerva Grimsley Blow. Henry owned various lead-mining operations, was president of the Iron Mountain Railroad, was a state senator, and was a minister to Brazil and Venezuela. Minerva was the daughter of a prominent manufacturer and local politician. The Blow children grew up in a deeply religious family surrounded by comfort, wealth, and high German culture. Henry Blow had founded a Presbyterian church in St. Louis. Her grandfather was Captain Peter Blow, the owner of the slave Dred Scott, who later challenged the slavery issue in court. Due to her family's social status, Blow received her education from her parents, various governesses, private tutors, and schools. Her parents highly valued education for their daughters although this was uncommon for Victorian families. Henry Blow contributed funds to build a public school which was named after him. At age eight, Susan was enrolled at the William McCartney School in New Orleans, Louisiana; she attended classes there for the next two years. At age sixteen Blow and her sister Nellie enrolled in the New York school of Henrietta Haynes but were forced to return home due to the outbreak of the Civil War. During this time Blow tutored her younger brothers and sister and taught Sunday school at Carleton Presbyterian Church. At age twenty, Blow met and fell in love with a soldier named Colonel William Cole, but her parents found him to be unsuitable. When Cole was discharged for medical reasons, her father took her to Washington D.C. and introduced her to another military man who was more to his liking. However, Blow never married. She was considered a member of the St. Louis School, a literary, philosophical, and educational movement. President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Henry Blow minister to Brazil in 1869, and Susan went with him as his secretary. During the next fifteen months, she quickly learned Portuguese. Her bilingual ability helped to ease trade communications between Brazil and the United States. In 1870, along with her mother and siblings, Blow went abroad to Europe; while there she began studying the philosophies of Hegel and the American Transcendentalists. However, while abroad she came across the kindergarten teaching methods of German idealist and philosopher Friedrich Froebel. Froebel believed in \\"learning-through-play\\" and cognitive development. Susan was inspired to bring these ideas back to St. Louis and her father offered to set up a kindergarten as a private school. Susan felt she could better serve children through the public school system. Career In 1871 Blow traveled to New York, where she spent a year being trained at the New York Normal Training Kindergarten, operated by Froebel devotee Maria Kraus-Boelt√©. Blow returned to St. Louis in 1873 and opened the nation‚Äôs first public kindergarten in Des Peres School in Carondelet, which by then had been annexed by the City of St. Louis. With the help of her two assistants, Mary Timberlake and Cynthia Dozier, Blow directed and taught a kindergarten class consisting of forty-two students. Not only did she pay all expenses to keep the kindergarten running that first year, she was not compensated for her hard work and dedication. About 150 women also volunteered to work at Blow's kindergartens between 1876-1877. In the kindergarten class, students learned from games and songs that Susan translated from Froebel's original German. Students played with different shaped blocks, papers and clay, and tried weaving and modeling to improve dexterity. Children also grew seeds in an outdoor garden. Blow would tell stories from the Bible or myths and legends. The classroom was much more cheerful than upper grades. The experimental class was a success and quickly grew. Within three years, her kindergarten system had fifty teachers and over one thousand students, and by 1883 every public school in St. Louis had a kindergarten. In 1875, the school board attempted to close the kindergartens in order to save money, but 1,500 signed a petition to keep them open. In 1876, the United States Centennial Commission in Philadelphia gave St. Louis and Blow an award for excellence of kindergarten in public schools. Blow was able to open her school, in part, thanks to the support she received from William Torrey Harris, the superintendent of schools in St. Louis. Harris believed the greatest educational concern of the time was the amount of young children who dropped out of school. Blow believed a kindergarten system would improve the dropout rate, for children would be starting school at an earlier age. Although he originally resisted the idea of a public program, he was persuaded by the school board‚Äôs support of Blow, her background, and her proposal to direct the program herself. In 1874 Blow opened a training school to accommodate the in-demand kindergarten teachers. Those in training spent mornings volunteering in the kindergarten classes and afternoons and weekends studying Froebel‚Äôs ideas. Through her work, Blow played a significant role in the history and development of early childhood education. For her pioneering work Blow was recognized with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. Later life and death Only ten years after opening her training school Blow withdrew from teaching due to Graves' disease, which is a form of hyperthyroidism. She retired in 1884 and moved to Boston with Laura Fischer, who moved there to direct the kindergarten program at Boston Public Schools. In her retirement, Blow wrote a book on Dante in 1890 and five books on Froebel's theories. She also helped found the International Kindergarten Union and held a three-year appointment to the Teachers College of Columbia University. In 1895, Blow moved to Cazenovia, New York to be near one of her sisters. She lectured on early childhood education all over the county, only stopping about a month before her death. She died in March 1916 in New York City. Most references state she died on March 26, but her tombstone at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis declares she died on March 27. At the time of her death, the St. Louis Globe-Democrat wrote, ‚ÄúA great commander is gone, but the soldiers will go marching on.‚Äù In April 1916, St. Louis celebrated Susan with a meeting of the Susan E. Blow Froebel League and a memorial fund was set up in her name to sponsor lectures. The organization did not last long, as many of Blow's ideas were German in origin and the United States entered World War I the following year. An early public elementary school in the Carondolet neighborhood of St. Louis was named for her father. Formerly known as Blow Elementary, it is today named the Lyon Academy at Blow.Lyon Academy at Blow. Blow Street, which runs through South St. Louis city from the Mississippi River at S. Broadway to the St. Louis Hills neighborhood, also bears her family name. Writings Blow served on the advisory committee for the International Kindergarten Union and Committee of Nineteen and translated two volumes of Froebel‚Äôs Mother Play in 1895.The Mottoes and Commentaries of Friedrich Froebel's \\"Mother Play\\"; mother communings and mottoes rendered into English verse by Henrietta R.

The Wilson administration changed the treaty by adding a provision similar in language to that of the Platt Amendment, which would have authorized United States military intervention in Nicaragua. The United States Senate opposed the new provision; in response, it was dropped and the treaty was formally ratified on June 19, 1916. History The democratically elected and reform-minded Liberal Party president Jos√© Santos Zelaya L√≥pez had incurred the wrath of the United States by negotiating with France, Germany and Japan to resurrect the proposed Nicaragua Canal, which might constitute potential future foreign competition with the newly built US-owned Panama Canal. After supporting an insurgency against the government led by Conservative Party insurgents Emiliano Chamorro and Juan Jos√© Estrada with arms, funds, troops, warships and economic measures, the United States eventually forced the popular previous liberal presidents Jos√© Zelaya and his successor Jose Madriz to flee the country. The United States then installed the conservative governments of first Juan Jos√© Estrada (soon deposed by the powerful Secretary of War Luis Mena) and then the former vice president Adolfo Diaz. When General Luis Mena convinced the National Assembly to name him successor to the unpopular pro-US Adolfo Diaz, the United States invaded and occupied Nicaragua militarily from 1912 to 1933, wrote a new constitution for the country, changed the National Assembly, and propped up successive conservative regimes under the presidents Adolfo Diaz, Emiliano Chamorro, and Diego Manuel Chamorro. Luis Mena fled into the countryside to start a rebellion, which continued under various leaders for the next 60 years. In exchange for political concessions from Adolfo Diaz, the United States provided the military strength to suppress popular revolt and ensure the conservative regime maintained control over the Nicaraguan government. For much of the 20th century Nicaragua remained controlled under the hereditary dictatorship of the Chamorro and after 1936 the Somoza dynasties, until widespread rebellions forced them out of power in the 1970s. The Treaty was named after the principal negotiators: William Jennings Bryan, U. S. Secretary of State; and the then General Emiliano Chamorro, representing the Nicaraguan government. By the terms of the treaty, the United States acquired the rights to any canal built in Nicaragua in perpetuity, a renewable 99 year option to establish a naval base in the Gulf of Fonseca and a renewable 99-year lease to the Great and Little Corn Islands in the Caribbean. For those concessions, Nicaragua received three million dollars. Most of the three million dollars was paid back to United States creditors by the United States officials in charge of Nicaraguan financial affairs, which allowed the Nicaraguan government to continue to collect internal revenue. The debt had been quickly amassed in a two-year period by the Nicaraguan government of Juan Jos√© Estrada under the American \\"dollars for bullets\\" scheme, in order to retard infrastructure development funding from rival powers, as well as lingering debts from earlier indemnities Nicaragua was forced to pay the foreign occupying powers of the United States and Great Britain, and repairing the devastation inflicted from the war with Great Britain, war with the United States and the civil war of Luis Mena's Rebellion.The Los Angeles Herald December 21, 1909. At the request of Nicaragua, the United States under Richard Nixon and Nicaragua under Anastasio Somoza Debayle, held a convention, on July 14, 1970, which officially abolished the treaty and all its provisions. Intended impact At various times since the Panama Canal opened in 1914, the Nicaragua route has been reconsidered. Its construction would shorten the water distance between New York and San Francisco by nearly . The Bryan‚ÄìChamorro Treaty kept Nicaragua and stopped any potential European powers from competing with the Panama Canal. Unintended impact The provision of the Bryan‚ÄìChamorro Treaty granting rights to United States to build a naval base in the Gulf of Fonseca was contested by El Salvador and Costa Rica. The Central American Court of Justice saw in the favor of the two countries. The United States ignored the decision, contributing significantly to the court's collapse in 1918.

After Reb Noson's death in 1844, Lubarski became a leading figure in the Breslover community and taught many people, including Rabbi Shimshon Barski and Rabbi Yisroel Halpern. Biography According to Breslover tradition, Lubarski and his brother, Reb Zanvil, were born as a result of a blessing that Reb Noson gave to their childless mother. She and her husband took care of one of the mikvahs in the town of Breslov, Ukraine. They often provided warm water and towels for Reb Noson to use each night when he arose for Tikkun Chatzot (the Midnight Lament). During the 1830s, when opposition against Reb Noson flared in the town of Breslov, Reb Noson's opponents tried to stop the caretakers from assisting him. They refused, which led to a boycott of their mikvah and resultant financial loss. Lubarski's mother appealed for relief to Reb Noson. Unable to help her with money, Reb Noson offered her a blessing instead. When he heard that she and her husband were childless, he blessed them with children. Reb Moshe and Reb Zanvil were born thereafter. Lubarski's faith in his mentor was so strong that he followed Reb Noson's guidance and teachings in all cases. Once his house was robbed, but instead of going out to find the thief, he repaired to the study hall, opened a copy of Reb Noson's Likutey Halachot, and began to study the laws and discourses on stealing. Soon afterward, his possessions were returned to him. Lubarski settled in Tcherin, a small town in eastern Ukraine, after his marriage, where he conversed daily with Reb Avraham Ber, the grandson of Rebbe Nachman and a follower of Reb Noson. Once, Reb Avraham Ber's father-in-law asked to speak with Lubarski as well. Awestruck, Lubarski protested, \\"What can I say to you about serving God? You knew the Rebbe!\\" Reb Avraham Ber's father-in-law replied, \\"Believe me, you learned more about Rebbe Nachman through Reb Noson than I know even from Rebbe Nachman himself!\\" References *Kramer, Chaim (1989).

Governance As provided in the Regulation, the epi is governed by a Council which is elected by the members of the respective national constituencies and by a Board elected by the Council, which includes its President. The epi Council has adopted internal regulations governing its conduct and functioning. Sixteen Committees, including numerous subcommittees and working groups, are responsible for conducting the large array of tasks and assignments faced by the epi. Topics covered by these committees are, e.g. European patent practice, litigation, biotechnology, professional education, discipline and professional conduct and various other matters of relevance for the profession and the organization of the Institute. Activities The epi as an organisation deals primarily with the development and implications of patent law. Through its Committees, the epi is at the forefront of patent law developments and regularly serves public policy leaders by issuing legal opinions and highly specialised advice. The epi is an observer in many advisory bodies of international organisations such as the Standing Advisory Committee before the European Patent Office (SACEPO) or the Standing Committee on the Law of Patents of the World Intellectual Property Organization (SCP). Another core area of the epi is to promote compliance by its members with the Rules of Professional Conduct through fair procedures. The epi further serves its members by providing them with advice and training as they advance within their profession, keeping them informed about latest developments and enriching the diversity of the profession, while responding to their individual professional needs. The epi likewise supports candidates to pass the European Qualifying Examination and become future members. The European Patent Institute publishes a quarterly journal, the epi Information ().

She was the second US Navy ship named for Charles Vernon Gridley. She served with distinction in the Pacific Theater during the Second World War and shared in the sinking of a Japanese submarine. History Gridley fitted out at Boston Navy Yard, and conducted shakedown in the Caribbean area until 27 October 1938, visiting Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Venezuela. She then underwent alterations at the Boston Navy Yard until 13 June 1938, when she departed that port, transited the Panama Canal, and entered San Diego harbor 5 July 1938. Joining Destroyer Division 11, Gridley spent the next months in tactical maneuvers off the coast of California, and 4 January 1939 departed with the Battle Force for combined maneuvers in the Caribbean. She participated in Fleet Problem 20 with the Fleet off Cuba and Haiti, after which she returned to Boston for repairs. The destroyer again sailed into San Diego 13 July 1939 and became flagship of Division 11. She conducted maneuvers off California until 2 April 1940, when Gridley and other ships of the fleet conducted Fleet Problem 21 in Hawaiian waters. Subsequently, Gridley operated out of Hawaii. =World War II= Gridley cleared Pearl Harbor 28 November 1941 as part of the antisubmarine screen for the aircraft carrier , flagship of Admiral Halsey, and after a stop at Wake Island, reversed course for Pearl Harbor. The Task Force was approaching that base on the morning of 7 December when the message heralding the beginning of the war was received: \\"Air raid on Pearl Harbor, this is no drill.\\" Gridley entered the harbor next day to help protect against renewed attack, and during the next five months was occupied escorting transports and repair vessels to and from Pearl Harbor and South Pacific ports. Her last such voyage was completed from 27 May 1942 and 5 June 1942 she arrived at Kodiak, Alaska, with the cruiser . In the Alaskan theater, Gridley escorted transports and patrolled the Japanese-held islands of Kiska and Attu, assisting in the bombardment of Kiska 7 August 1942. She acted during this period as flagship for famous destroyerman Comdr. Frederick Moosbrugger. Departing Dutch Harbor 25 September 1942, Gridley joined the task force in Hawaiian waters and later performed escort missions for both combatant and non-combatant ships in the Fijis and New Hebrides. In December 1942 she escorted oiler out of Noumea to fueling rendezvous with the carrier task forces supporting the bitter fighting in the Solomons. Shifting her base of operations to Purvis Bay, in the Solomons, 13 July, Gridley guarded the high-speed transports which rescued survivors from the cruiser in Parasco Bay 16 July 1943, and teamed with destroyer to escort infantry landing craft from Guadalcanal for the landings on Tambatuni, New Georgia. She bombarded shore installations near the invasion beaches 25 July and screened the ships supporting the landing. In company with six other destroyers she destroyed Japanese landing barges in Vella Gulf 10 August, and screened Saratoga during air operations in the Solomons until 25 August. Gridley returned to Pearl Harbor with escort carriers and on 4 September 1943 and then departed for San Diego, where she remained for repairs 11 September to 26 October 1943. The Gilbert Islands were her next destination, and Gridley left Pearl Harbor once more 10 November 1943 for Makin Island. She assisted in the bombardment of that island, screened aircraft carriers, and then conducted independent patrol in the area until setting course for Hawaii 1 December. =1944= Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher's Carrier Task Force 58 departed Pearl Harbor 18 January 1944 for the offensive in the Marshall Islands, with Gridley again acting as screening ship for Saratoga. Gridley guarded the carrier during the strikes against Wotje and Eniwetok, and 8 March sailed for the New Hebrides with carriers , , and , assisting them in support of the developing New Guinea offensive. The destroyer sailed with the task force 7 June 1944 to take part in the invasion of the Marianas, where the carriers pounded Saipan, Rota, and Guam. In all these operations Gridley and her sister destroyers protected the carriers against air and submarine attack. Gridley was with American forces in the pivotal Battle of the Philippine Sea 19 to 20 June 1944, when four waves of Japanese torpedo bombers and escorting fighters were decimated by fleet air and surface units. Gridleys antiaircraft fire helped to protect the aircraft carriers, with the result that Japanese air strength was virtually ended with this battle. Gridley departed Eniwetok Atoll 30 June 1944 bound with the carriers for strikes on Iwo Jima, Guam, Yap, Ulithi, and the Volcano Islands. She supported directly the American landings on Peleliu 15 September 1944, shooting down at least one Japanese attack plane. After screening the carriers in attacks on Okinawa and Formosa, Gridley joined the American forces for the invasion of the Philippines. While protecting the large ships off Luzon 28 October 1944 she and destroyer detected and sank the with a series of devastating depth charge attacks. In the succeeding days, Gridley fought off Japanese kamikazes and returned to Ulithi with damaged carriers and on 2 November. =1945= Gridley was soon at sea again, however, clearing Ulithi 5 November with the fast carrier task force for the Leyte operation. She later joined a group of escort carriers and served as a bombardment and patrol ship during the landings in Lingayen Gulf until 10 February 1945. After stopping again at Ulithi, Gridley escorted battleship en route to Pearl Harbor, and then sailed via San Diego and the Panama Canal for New York, where she arrived 30 March 1945. She entered the New York Navy Yard next day for much-needed repairs, and after finishing her overhaul departed the United States 22 June 1945. She served in Europe from July 1945 to January 1946. Fate Gridley was decommissioned on 18 April 1946. She was sold for scrap in August 1947.

History  The JITC had its roots in the TRI-TAC program of the 1970s, which sought to streamline and test the technology behind field and tactical command systems. The program began officially in 1971, and work started in 1976 at Fort Huachuca in southern Arizona. The TRI-TAC program tested various field equipment for years, but ran into problems with working with other branches of the Department of Defense's testing programs. With an eye to fix this problem, the TRI-TAC program was rebranded and refocused in 1984 to become the Joint Tactical Command, Control, and Communications Agency (JTC3A). This led to the Fort Huachuca part of the operations to be renamed as the Joint Interoperability Test Force (JITF). Continued problems with cooperation and coordination between different testing agencies in the 80's led to another round of consolidation, which turned the Fort Huachuca operations into the Joint Interoperability Test Center (also abbreviated as JITC somewhat confusingly but not the same as the Joint Interoperability Test Command). Operations were further consolidated in 1988, and then in 1989 the Test Center gained its final name of the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC). These final rounds of consolidation were concurrent with a Department of Defense push towards \\"interoperability\\", which aimed to ensure that military technology could work across branches of the military, between different arms of the same branch of the military, and even between nations as coalition military action became more frequent. The focus of the JITC shifted towards interoperability and information technology testing in the 90's. By 2011 it employed more than 1,300 military personnel and contractors to test and certify military technology.  Locations  JITC facilities are located at Fort Huachuca, Arizona and Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. An additional JITC mission used to exist at Indian Head, Maryland, but was closed in December 2016 resulting in testing moved to Fort Huachuca, Arizona or Fort Meade, Maryland.

It was incorporated as an independent city in 1851 and was annexed by the City of St. Louis in 1870. As of the 2000 Census, the neighborhood has a population of 9,960 people. Name Carondelet was named after Baron Carondelet, the governor of the Spanish colony Upper Louisiana. The community also held a number of names and nicknames over the centuries, including: Delor's Village, Catalan's Prairie, Louisbourg, Vide Poche, and Sugarloaf. History Carondelet was founded in 1767 by Clement Delor de Treget who was born in Cahors, Quercy in southern France. He obtained a grant from St. Ange and built a stone house. The village was first known as Delor's Village. Afterwards it was known as Catalan's Prairie, named for Louis Catalan, an early settler. Later the village was called Louisbourg, most likely in honor of Louis XVI, the king of France (1774-1793). It is said that shortly after the territory passed from French to Spanish hands, Treget wished to have his commission as captain of the militia renewed. Since he was French and Baron de Carondelet, the governor general of Louisiana, was in Spanish service, he feared that his commission might be refused, so he flattered Carondelet by naming the village for him and received his commission. In the early days the village was given the nickname Vide Poche. This name is often mistakenly translated as \\"empty pocket\\", which would rather be \\"Poche Vide\\" in French. This is a folk etymology that rests on a history of poverty among its inhabitants. As it goes, Carondelet citizens would have to buy flour from St. Louis, and often they could not pay for it, for their pockets were empty. Another explanation translates the nickname to mean \\"Empties Pocket,\\" which makes sense in French, thus conveying the idea that it was a place where the pockets of those visiting would be emptied. The inhabitants of Carondelet were noted for their hospitality and fondness for all kinds of sports and amusements. The St. Louis visitor would return home with emptied pockets - the Carondelet men may have had fleeter horses or have been more skillful card players. When a St. Louisan was asked to visit Carondelet on Sunday afternoon, he would reply, \\"A quoi sert, c'est un vide poche.\\" (meaning: \\"Of what use, is a place that empties pocket). Another nickname applied to Carondelet was \\"Pain de Sucre\\" or the \\"Sugarloaf.\\" An in-depth study of several instances of Vide Poche in North America shed light on the complex history of this place name.3. Pierre Gendreau-H√©tu, \\" Vide-Poche, un archipel toponymique in√©dit en Am√©rique du Nord \\", Onomastica Canadiana, 2018, vol. 96 (1-2), p. 1-30. and 2. Pierre Gendreau-H√©tu, \\" Vide-Poche, toponyme g√©n√©rique d'Am√©rique fran√ßaise? \\", Onomastica Canadiana, (to appear). It turns out that this name migrated to Missouri from the Saint Lawrence Valley and initially meant \\"the mill\\", for \\"Vide-Poche\\" was documented to be a nickname in New France for the mill and the original population in the area mainly was from Canada. This St. Louis Vide Poche is indeed known to have harbored a mill in its very beginning. It seems however that another identical compound meaning \\"pickpocket\\" added to the semantic load of this place name. In a 1799 census, Carondelet was described as \\"two leagues below St. Louis\\" and having a population of 181 white residents and 3 African slaves. Carondelet was incorporated in 1832, merged with the first ward of St. Louis under the name of South St. Louis in 1860, and annexed to St. Louis in 1870. Carondelet is the first foundation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet,https://www.carondeleths.org/about/how-to-say-carondelet a Congregation, with French roots, who arrived in America in 1836. The community is particularly associated with processing lead from the Southeast Missouri Lead District. The affiliation began in the 1840s with the production lead shot shipped in via the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway. In 1873, Susan Blow founded the first continuous, publicly funded kindergarten in the United States, at Carondolet's Des Peres School. During the American Civil War, 32 ironclad gunboats for the Union Army and Navy were produced at the James Buchanan Eads-owned Union Marine Works shipyards, including four of the initial City class ironclads: St. Louis, Carondelet, Pittsburgh, and Louisville. The three other City class gunboats (Cairo, Mound City, and ) were subcontracted out by Eads and built in Mound City, Illinois. From 1870-1930, Hertz Metal Company produced baling wire and also operated a lead smelter. In 1876 Provident Chemical Works became a world leader in production of phosphates from its Carondelet Plant in a process that initially involved lead. In the 1920s the plant was purchased by Swann Chemical Company, and then in 1935 by Monsanto. The River des Peres was rerouted through the plant in the 1930s as part of a Works Progress Administration project. Monsanto spun off the production to Solutia. In 2000 it became part of Astaris and then Israel Chemical Limited. The plant produces 250 million pounds per year of phosphate and phosphoric acid products. Carondelet Court House, 1860 Originally, the neighborhood was populated predominantly by French and then later German immigrants. Today the neighborhood contains a mixture of industrial uses along the Mississippi River and residential and commercial uses further from the river. Because it once existed as an independent village, the neighborhood contains some of the oldest homes in St. Louis. Most of the housing was constructed between 1880 and 1930. Housing in the area ranges from modest single story cottages, to apartment buildings, to larger single family homes. Most of the housing is of brick construction. Demographics In 2010 Carondelet's population was 57.3% White, 33.8% Black, 0.6% Native American, 1.3% Asian, 3.7% Two or More Races, and 3.2% Some Other Race. 7.1% of the population was of Hispanic or Latino origin.

Early life John H. Steele was born in Salisbury, North Carolina, on January 4, 1789. His mother, Elizabeth Taylor, was unmarried. His father, John Steele was married to another woman, and was the father of several children with his wife. As a result of the circumstances of his parentage and the early death of his mother, John Hardy Steele was raised primarily by his maternal grandfather, Absalom Taylor. Steele was educated in Salisbury, and at age 14 was apprenticed as a cabinetmaker and chair maker. At age 22 Steele settled in Fayetteville, where he worked at his trade for Nathaniel Morrison, a native of Peterborough, New Hampshire. Morrison was impressed with Steele's mechanical aptitude, and asked Steele to accompany him to New Hampshire to establish a textile manufacturing business. Steele designed and constructed the spinning mules and looms for Morrison's mills, one of which was the first to weave cotton cloth by waterpower. Later career In 1824 Steele joined several partners to establish the Union Manufacturing Company, a cloth production factory which operated successfully with Steele as manager. A Democrat in a town that was predominantly Whig in its politics, Steele was popular enough personally to win election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 1829. He declined reelection, and also declined an 1831 nomination for a seat in the New Hampshire State Senate. From 1830 to 1838 Steele served as Peterborough's Town Meeting Moderator. Steele was also active in the New Hampshire Militia, and attained the rank of colonel as aide-de-camp to Governor Matthew Harvey. In 1840 Steele won election to the Executive Council of New Hampshire, and he was reelected in 1841. Governor Steele was elected Governor in 1844, and reelected in 1845. His term was marked by the creation of a state railroad commission. In addition, Steele provided letters of introduction to James Knox Polk and members of Polk's cabinet for his friend Jesse Carter Little, a Mormon pioneer who sought government assistance to enable the Mormons to begin settling in Utah. Post- governorship After leaving office Steele retired to a farm, where he conducted experiments in animal husbandry and other scientific agriculture techniques. He was an organizer and President of the Peterborough Savings Bank. He served as a Selectman in 1846, and in 1850 he was a delegate to New Hampshire's constitutional convention.

It focuses on water quality, beach access, beach and surf spot preservation, and sustaining marine and coastal ecosystems. Headquartered in San Clemente, California, the Surfrider Foundation maintains a small staff, which work to support the organization's network of regional grassroots chapters. The current CEO is Chad Nelsen. History Representatives with Congressman Jimmy Panetta in 2020. The Surfrider Foundation was started in Malibu, California in 1984 by a handful of surfers to protest threats to their local surf break at Malibu Point. The organization continued on for several years as a loose advocacy group until 1991, when the first chapters were founded. At that point the Surfrider Foundation transitioned into a grassroots activist organization. Today the Surfrider Foundation maintains over 50,000 members and 80 chapters worldwide. Programs and campaigns Surfrider Foundation volunteers and staff utilize a number of programs in their efforts to protect the coast and raise awareness of environmental issues. * Respect the Beach - A coastal education program to inform students * State of the Beach - A continuously updated report published by the Surfrider Foundation that evaluates coastal environments by a number of \\"Beach Health Indicators\\" * Blue Water Task Force - An all-volunteer led monitoring program that tests and reports on coastal water quality. * Ocean Friendly Gardens - An outreach program designed to reduce urban runoff and residential water consumption. * Ocean Friendly Restaurants - An outreach program designed to reduce single-use plastic. The Ocean Friendly Restaurants program offers restaurants an easy way to show their commitment to making sustainable choices for our ocean. * Rise Above Plastics - An educational program designed to raise awareness of and reduce the amount of plastic pollution in our marine environments. * Beachapedia A wiki-based coastal information resource drawing on expertise of Surfrider Foundation experts and activists. In November 2018 the Surfrider Foundation launched a campaign declaring \\"We are the United States and Oceans of America\\". The campaign sought to inform people that America is made up of more water than land and that the ocean is the responsibility of all Americans. America‚Äôs oceans cover nearly 4.5 million square miles, which is about 20% greater than U.S. landmass.

It was owned and operated jointly by the Chicago and North Western Railway (1936‚Äì55), Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (1955-71), the Union Pacific Railroad, and the Southern Pacific Railroad. It provided premium extra fare service from Chicago to San Francisco when introduced in 1936 of 39 hr 45 min each way. Overview Southern Pacific SDP45 leads City of San Francisco west at SN overpass , Cannon CA, in April 1971-- just before Amtrak As with the City of Los Angeles, many of the train's cars bore the names of locales around its namesake city, including Mission Dolores, the nickname given to San Francisco's Mission San Francisco de As√≠s. Competing streamlined passenger trains were, starting in 1949, the California Zephyr on the Western Pacific (WP), Denver and Rio Grande Western (D&RGW;), and Chicago, Burlington and Quincy (CB&Q;) Railroads, and starting in 1954, the San Francisco Chief on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (AT&SF;). In October 1955 the Milwaukee Road replaced the Chicago and North Western between Chicago and Omaha; in 1960 the City of San Francisco was combined with the City of Los Angeles east of Ogden. Incidents The City of San Francisco derailed in Nevada in 1939. The incident was ruled an act of sabotage, but, despite years of investigation, remains unsolved. A blizzard in the Sierra Nevada trapped the train for six days in January 1952, on Track #1 at Yuba Pass (), 17 miles (27 km) west of Donner Pass. Snow drifts from 100 mph (160 km/h) winds blocked the train, burying it in 12 feet of snow and stranding it from January 13 to 19. The event made international headlines. During the effort to reach the train, the railroad's snow-clearing equipment and snow-blowing rotary plows became frozen to the tracks near Emigrant Gap. Hundreds of workers and volunteers, including escaped German POW Georg G√§rtner, rescued stranded passengers by clearing nearby Route 40 to reach the train. The 196 passengers and 30 crewmembers were evacuated within 72 hours of rescuers reaching the train. Upon evacuation, they traveled on foot to vehicles that carried them the few highway miles to Nyack Lodge. The train itself was extricated three days later on January 19.Bull, Howard W.

It was constructed in 1930, and is located in Downtown Atlanta. It is a high-rise office tower very similar to dozens of other city halls built in the United States during the same time period. Located in South Downtown, it is near other governmental structures, such as the Georgia State Capitol and the Fulton County Courthouse. The Neo-Gothic structure features many architectural details that have helped to make the building a historical landmark. It is Atlanta‚Äôs fourth city hall. History Atlanta‚Äôs first official city hall =Early city hall buildings= After half a decade of makeshift meeting places for city business (including hotels and grocery stores), in 1853 mayor of Atlanta John Mims purchased the four-acre (16,000 m¬≤) ‚ÄúPeters‚Äôs Reserve‚Äù from Richard Peters for $5,000. On this land (current site of the Georgia State Capitol) was built a two-story brick structure (with an additional two- story cupola) for the city hall as well as some court functions. Each floor was 70 by providing nearly of space. It opened on October 17, 1854 and served for three decades during which time it served as campgrounds for the occupying Union army during the war and was briefly the state capitol during 1868 when the capital first moved from Milledgeville, Georgia. It was demolished in 1885. In 1882, Atlanta City Hall was relocated to the old chamber of commerce building, which was four stories tall and located on the northeast corner of Pryor and Hunter, across Hunter (now Martin Luther King Jr. Drive) from the site of the Fulton County Courthouse. It was the city hall from 1882 to 1911, leaving the same year that the Courthouse started construction. =1911‚Äì1930 City Hall building= City Hall 1911‚Äì1930 In 1911, the city hall moved to what once the U.S. Post Office and Customs House (Atlanta), located on the north side of Marietta Street between Forsyth and Fairlie. Purchased from the U.S. federal government by Atlanta mayor Robert Maddox for $70,000 (equivalent to $ million in ), this imposing structure served as city hall for nearly twenty years. It was so solidly built that the first company hired to raze it actually went out of business before completing the job. =Current building= The current city hall, designed by G. Lloyd Preacher, was completed in February 1930. Located in South Downtown at 68 Mitchell Street SW, the building occupies the site of the house that General William Tecumseh Sherman took as the headquarters of his occupation after his Atlanta Campaign and before his March to the Sea (Sept.‚ÄìNov., 1864). The house was one of the few buildings in Atlanta that Sherman did not destroy. At the time, it belonged to Richard F. Lyon, an associate justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia.Atlanta City Hall , City of Atlanta Online This building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. An annex was completed in 1989, and the building was designated a ‚Äúlandmark building exterior‚Äù on October 23 of that year.

It was completed in 2003, and contains a garden with 2,800 plants from 31 species. =City Hall East= Between 1990‚Äì2010 some city hall services had been available at City Hall East, located on Ponce de Leon Avenue in the Old Fourth Ward neighborhood, northeast of downtown. The building formerly belonged to Sears. The city of Atlanta sold the building in June 2011 to Jamestown, a developer, which agreed to pay $27 million for the property. It was renamed Ponce City Market.

It was at one stage intended to become the eastern section of the Merseyrail Outer Loop, an orbital line circling the city. History The line was built by the Cheshire Lines Committee, branching from the Committee's Liverpool to Manchester line at Hunts Cross in the south of the city, running north skirting the eastern edge of Liverpool, finally arriving at the Walton Triangle junction. One line continued north to Aintree, another curved west through the Rice Lane to Kirkdale tunnel which brought the line facing south, towards Liverpool Docks. The line ran alongside the already existing LYR line before terminating at Huskisson railway station, just after Sandhills railway station. A small line left Huskisson, retracing the route northward before turning towards the river and the Midland Railway's Sandon and Canada Dock Goods station. The line opened between 1879 and 1880. The Aintree branch was extended to Southport in 1884. The route closed in stages. In 1960 the line closed to passengers between Aintree and Gateacre. In 1972 passenger trains from Liverpool Central High Level to Gateacre were withdrawn. The Gateacre service was proposed to be reinstated in 1978, with the station being the terminus of the new Merseyrail Northern Line. However this never materialised, with the terminus being cut back to Hunts Cross station on the southern Liverpool to Manchester line. The line continued to carry freight to Liverpool's docks until it was lifted in 1979. The trackbed of the main section of line now forms part of the National Cycle Network Route 62 and the Trans Pennine Trail. Route of line today. Planned reopening West Derby station on the North Liverpool Extension Line which was to be a part of Merseyrail's Outer Loop. Railway Bridge, Walton Hall Avenue The Orbital Outer Rail Loop was a part of the initial Merseyrail plans of the 1970s. The route circled the outer fringes of the city of Liverpool using primarily existing rail lines merged to create the loop. With the city of Liverpool having a semi-circular footprint with the city centre at the western fringe against the River Mersey, the western section of the loop would run through the city centre. This was completed being now the a part of the Merseyrail's Northern Line. The scheme was begun along with the creation of Merseyrail, however, owing to cost-cutting the eastern section was postponed. The concept of using the former Cheshire Lines Committee's North Liverpool Extension LineCheshire Lines Committee Lines: North Liverpool Extension Line, Southport and Cheshire Lines Extension Railway, Garston and Liverpool Railway () route through the eastern suburbs of Liverpool as the eastern section of a rapid-transit orbital route circling the outskirts of the city first emerged before the Second World War. The proposal was for a 'belt' line using the now- demolished Liverpool Overhead Railway, which ran along the river front, as its western section. In the 1960s, during the planning for Merseyrail, this was developed into the Outer Rail Loop scheme: an electric rapid-transit passenger line circling the outer districts of the city by using a combination of newly electrified existing lines and a new link tunnel under the city centre joining together lines to the north and south of the city centre completing the loop. A feature was that passengers on the mainline radial routes into Lime Street station from the east and south could transfer onto the Outer Loop at two parkway interchange stations and complete their journey to Liverpool suburbs avoiding the need to travel into the city centre: Liverpool South Parkway was one of these stations, opening thirty years after the initial proposal. The Outer Loop would have connected the eastern suburbs of the city‚ÄîGateacre, Childwall, Broadgreen, Knotty Ash, West Derby, Norris Green and Walton‚Äîwith the city centre. The final plan of the Outer Loop consisted of two sub-loops - serving the northern and southern suburbs with both running through the city centre from the east. These sub-loops allowed more direct journeys to the city centre from the eastern suburbs, giving the overall scheme greater viability. =Key components= The key components of the Loop were as follows: The West Section - the existing Merseyrail Electrics Northern Line from Sandhills in the north (later Aintree on the Ormskirk branch) to Hunts Cross. This section includes the most expensive part of the Outer Rail Loop - the Link Line tunnel under Liverpool city centre - and the reopened and electrified line from Liverpool Central to Hunts Cross. The East Section - the former Cheshire Lines Committee North Liverpool Extension Line initially from Hunts Cross to Walton, however, amended to Aintree. The North Section - originally the CLC line from Walton to Kirkdale via the Breeze Hill tunnel. In later versions of the scheme the North Mersey Branch from Aintree to Bootle was substituted. The latter is still intact although only used by maintenance trains whilst the former is now partially built over. The Central Section - the central section was a later addition to the plan and effectively divided the loop into two sub-loops and also gave city centre access for the towns east of Merseyside. This included the unrealised Edge Hill Spur scheme from Liverpool Central Low Level to Edge Hill using the Waterloo Tunnel and a section of the City Line from Edge Hill to Broad Green. A major junction was to have been formed at Broad Green with the eastern section of the Outer Loop with a six platform underground station to be named Rocket under the car park of the Rocket pub near the M62/Queens Drive road junction. The Outer Rail Loop would have been double-track throughout and electrified using the 750 V DC third-rail system used by the Merseyrail Electrics network. Although no official proposals have been made to revive the scheme in recent years, the route is effectively safeguarded with periodic calls being made by local politicians for the revival of the complete project or just the short stretch of the route from Hunts Cross to Gateacre.http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Images/tcm21-170943.pdf The Gateacre service was the last to operate out of the former Liverpool Central High-Level Station prior to its closure in 1972. Today The Outer Rail Loop project was a victim of the recession of the late 1970s compounded by delays and cost overruns on the Loop and Link projects and local political opposition. The project was abandoned as a working proposal by Merseytravel in the 1980s. Much expense was incurred in constructing a large bridge taking the M62 motorway over the eastern section and header tunnels at Liverpool Central station. The route is still largely intact, complete with bridges, it is used as walking and cycling trail through the suburbs, though the route is still protected for rail use. = Notable events = In 2012 the body of missing person Paula Hounslea was discovered on an embankment of the loop line cycle path near its junction with Blackthorne Road in Fazakerley.

He was the first African American to play for the New York Giants and also the first to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Born and raised in the Philadelphia area, Tunnell played college football at the University of Toledo in 1942 and University of Iowa in 1946 and 1947. He also served in the United States Coast Guard from 1943 to 1946. He received the Silver Lifesaving Medal for heroism in rescuing a shipmate from flames during a torpedo attack in 1944 and rescuing another shipmate who fell into the sea in 1946. He next played 14 seasons in the National Football League (NFL) as a defensive halfback and safety for the New York Giants (1948‚Äì1958) and Green Bay Packers (1959‚Äì1961). He was selected as a first-team All-Pro six times and played in nine Pro Bowls. He was a member of NFL championship teams in 1956 and 1961. When he retired as a player, he held NFL career records for interceptions (79), interception return yards (1,282), punt returns (258), and punt return yards (2,209). After retiring as a player, Tunnell served as a special assistant coach and defensive backs coach for the New York Giants from 1963 to 1974. In addition to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he was named to the NFL's 1950s All-Decade Team and the all-time All-Pro team, and was ranked number 70 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. Early years Tunnell was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, though sources conflict as to his year of birth. His tombstone as well as the Social Security Death Index and Tunnell's Department of Veterans Affairs BIRLS Death File reflect a birth date of March 29, 192 _4_.Ancestry.com. U.S., Social Security Death Index, 1935‚Äì2014 [database on-line].Ancestry.com. U.S., Department of Veterans Affairs BIRLS Death File, 1850‚Äì2010 [database on-line]. Official NFL records and multiple sources in the early 1960s reported his date of birth as March 29, 192 _2_.(\\"The Packer record book says that Tunnell was born March 29, 1922, making him 39 ‚Äì the same age as Jack Benny.\\") Tunnell listed his birth date as March 29, 192 _3_ , on his 1942 draft card and on his 1950 application for World War II benefits.The National Archives in St. Louis, Missouri; St. Louis, Missouri; Draft Registration Cards for Pennsylvania, October 16, 1940 ‚Äì March 31, 1947; Record Group: Records of the Selective Service System, 147; Box: 2560. Source Information: Ancestry.com. U.S. WWII Draft Cards Young Men, 1940-1947 [database on-line]. Other sources record his birth year as 1925. In 1961, Tunnell joked about his age: \\"I'm not really 41, as everyone says. I'm closer to 42.\\" Tunnell grew up in the Garrett Hill neighborhood of Radnor Township, approximately eight miles northwest of Philadelphia. His parents were divorced when Tunnell was young, and he and three siblings were raised by his mother, Catherine, who worked as a housekeeper in the homes of wealthy families in the Philadelphia Main Line area. His sister, Vivian, recalled Garrett Hill as a multi-ethnic neighborhood where \\"everybody mingled\\", and her brother \\"learned from his environment ‚Äì be yourself, but adapt to others who might be different in the group.\\" Tunnell attended Radnor High School where he was a star halfback in 1940 and 1941. Tunnell was included in the inaugural class of inductees to the Radnor High School Hall of Fame in 2003. College and military service =Toledo= Tunnell enrolled at the University of Toledo in the fall of 1942 and played college football as a halfback for Toledo Rockets football team. He was described as the \\"main spring\\" of Toledo's offense in the first part of the 1942 season. However, on October 26, 1942, he sustained a broken neck in a game when he was blocked while attempting to make a tackle against Marshall. He recuperated sufficiently to help lead the Toledo Rockets men's basketball team to the finals of the 1943 National Invitation Tournament. =Coast Guard= The Coast Guard named the Bernard C. Webber, and all its other Sentinel class cutters, after heroes, and chose to name the 45th vessel after Tunnell. Tunnell's neck injury in 1942 resulted in his being rejected in efforts to enlist in both the United States Army and Navy during World War II. In May 1943, Tunnell enlisted in the United States Coast Guard. From August 1943 to July 1944, he served on the USS Etamin, a cargo ship that was manned by Coast Guard personnel and stationed in the South West Pacific Area. In April 1944, while unloading explosives and gasoline at Aitape in Papua New Guinea, the Etamin was struck by a torpedo dropped from a Japanese airplane; Tunnell saved a fellow crew member who was set afire in the blast, beat out the flames with his hands, sustained burns to his own hands, and carried the shipmate to safety. He was next stationed at San Francisco and Alameda from August 1944 to October 1945.Application for World War II Compensation completed by Emlen Lewis Tunnell and dated March 20, 1950. He listed his birth date as March 29, 1923, at Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Ancestry.com. Pennsylvania, Veteran Compensation Application Files, WWII, 1950-1966 [database on-line]. In the fall of 1944, Tunnell played at the halfback position for the San Francisco Coast Guard Pilots football team. On November 11, 1944, he led the Pilots to a 13‚Äì0 victory over Amos Alonzo Stagg's Pacific Tigers football team, throwing 22 yards for a touchdowns and returning an interception 75 yards for another touchdown. At the end of the 1944 season, he was named to the All-Pacific Coast service football team. He also played basketball for the San Francisco Coast Guard, scoring 13 points in a December 1944 game against the California Golden Bears. In March 1946, while stationed at Naval Station Argentia in Newfoundland, Tunnell rescued a shipmate who fell from the USS Tampa. Tunnell jumped into the 32-degree water and saved his drowning shipmate. In 2011, Tunnell was posthumously awarded the Silver Lifesaving Medal for his heroism in rescuing his shipmates on the Etamin and Tampa. On December 12, 2017, the Coast Guard announced that it planned to name its 45th Sentinel class cutter the USCGC Emlen Tunnell. =Iowa= Tunnell was discharged from the Coast Guard in April 1946. He enrolled at the University of Iowa in the fall of 1946. Playing for the 1946 Iowa football team, Tunnell led the team with 541 yards of total offense and 28 pass completions and ranked second on the team with 333 rushing yards. On October 11, 1947, he set an Iowa single-game record with 155 receiving yards and three touchdowns on six receptions. Three weeks later, Tunnell quit the team after an argument with backfield coach Frank Carideo. He apologized and was reinstated two days later, but he played \\"sparingly\\" in the final two games of the 1947 season. Tunnell left Iowa in January 1948 in order to make some money to enable him to return and play football in the fall. He was told by school officials that, in order to be eligible to play football again in the fall, he would need to return for summer school and make up for a class he failed in the fall. Tunnell later explained: \\"I got a telegram on Sunday saying I had to be back in school on Monday and didn't have any money or nothing.\\" Professional football player =New York Giants= On July 24, 1948, Tunnell signed with the New York Giants. He was the first African American signed by, and the first to play for, the Giants. He later wrote that he hitchhiked from his family home in Garrett Hill to New York City to meet Jack Mara, son of Giants founder Tim Mara, and ask for a try out. In his Hall of Fame induction speech, Tunnell thanked a West Indian banana-truck driver who dropped him off near this Polo Grounds \\"appointment\\". As a rookie in 1948, Tunnell appeared in 10 games and intercepted seven passes, including one returned 43 yards for a touchdown. Between 1949 and 1952, he was known as one of the best pass defenders and punt returners in the NFL. He was a key element in the Giants' famed \\"umbrella defense\\" that shut down the passing game of opponents in the early 1950s, and he was referred to as the Giants' \\"offense on defense\\". His accomplishments during those prime years include the following: * In 1949, he was selected as an All-NFL/AAFC player by the International News Service. He led the NFL with two interceptions returned for touchdown and three non- offensive touchdowns. He ranked second in the NFL with 315 punt returns yards and 251 interception return yards and third with 10 interceptions. * In 1950, he ranked second in the NFL with 305 punt return yards and fourth with 167 interception return yards. * In 1951, he was selected as a first-team All-Pro by the Associated Press (AP) and United Press (UP). He led the NFL with a career-high 489 punt return yards and four non-offensive touchdowns. He returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown, and his combined total of 716 kick and punt return yards was second best in the NFL. His 37.8 yards per kick return and three punt returns for touchdowns remain Giants franchise records. His nine interceptions and average of 14.4 yards per punt return both ranked third in the NFL. * In 1952, he was again selected as a first-team All-Pro by the AP and UP. He led the NFL with six fumble recoveries and 411 punt return yards and averaged 13.7 yards per return. He also ranked among the league leaders with seven interceptions and 149 interception return yards. He gained more yards (924) returning interceptions, punts, and kickoffs than the 1952 NFL rushing leader, Dan Towler. Tunnell remained with the Giants for a total of 11 years from 1948 to 1958. During that time, he was selected as a first- team All-Pro six times, played in eight Pro Bowls, and set franchise records that still stand with 74 intercepted passes for 1,240 interception return yards and four touchdowns (tied with Dick Lynch and Jason Sehorn). He also recovered 15 fumbles and still holds franchise records with 257 punt returns for 2,206 yards and five touchdowns, which was good for an average of 8.6 yards per return. His total of 3,421 return yards is also a franchise record. =Green Bay Packers= After the 1958 season, the Giants' offensive coordinator Vince Lombardi left New York to become head coach and general manager of the Green Bay Packers. In June 1959, the Packers, in one of their first major personnel moves under Lombardi, purchased Tunnell from the Giants. In three years with the Packers, Tunnell saw reduced playing time, but helped to bolster the defense with his experience, worked to develop the team's young players, and became known as \\"an unofficial pastor\\" for the team. He appeared in 13 games for the 1961 Packers team that won the NFL championship. He saw playing time in red zone defensive situations. Defensive backs coach Norb Hecker said of Tunnell: \\"He was still a vicious tackler. When the opposition got inside our 15, we put him in and he responded with the fury of a linebacker. He could fall back on experience and by watching an offensive player's move was seldom beat.\\" =Career accomplishments and honors= In March 1962, Tunnell announced his retirement as a player. At that time, he held several NFL records, including the following: * His 79 career interceptions were an NFL record and remain second most in NFL history, having been surpassed in 1979 by fellow Iowa Hawkeye Paul Krause. * His 1,282 interception return yards were an NFL record for four decades and rank fifth in NFL history as of 2017. * His 258 punt returns were an NFL record, but rank 19th in league history as of 2017. * His 2,209 punt return yards were an NFL record, but rank 30th as of 2017. * He played in 158 consecutive games which was also an NFL record when he retired as a player. During his 14-year NFL career, Tunnell also totaled 16 fumble recoveries, 8.6 yards per punt return, and 1,215 yards on 46 kickoff returns (26.4 yards per return). Tunnell has received numerous honors for his contributions to the sport, including the following: * In February 1967, he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was the first African American and the first player who played strictly as a defensive back to be inducted. * In August 1969, he was named to the NFL's 1950s All-Decade Team as a safety. * In September 1969, he was one of 16 players named to the all-time All-Pro team selected by the Pro Football Hall of Fame. * In March 1975, he was inducted into the Iowa Sports Hall of Fame. * In August 1999, he was ranked number 70 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. * In 2010, he was one of the 22 players included in the New York Giants Ring of Honor at MetLife Stadium. * Also in 2010, the NFL Network ranked Tunnell 79th on its list of the 100 greatest players of all time. * In 2014, he was ranked as the second greatest player in New York Giants history in the book, \\"The 50 Greatest Players in New York Giants Football History\\". On June 2, 2018, a statue of Tunnell was installed in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Coaching and family Tunnell was married in 1962 to Patricia Dawkins. They had no children. In the fall of 1962, Tunnell worked as a scout for the Giants and Packers, observing college players on Saturdays and watching the Giants' upcoming opponents on Sundays. In May 1963, he was hired by the Giants as a special assistant coach under head coach Allie Sherman. In addition to his scouting duties, he was responsible for \\"special assignments\\" during the Giants' training camp. In February 1965, Tunnell was promoted to assistant coach responsible for the Giants' defensive backs. While some sources credit Tunnell as the first African American to work as an assistant coach in the NFL, and even as the first black coach in the NFL, Fritz Pollard was a head coach in the NFL in the 1920s, and Lowell Perry was an assistant coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1957. Tunnell suffered a minor heart attack in October 1974 and thereafter assumed a new position as the Giants' assistant personnel director. In July 1975, Tunnell died from a heart attack during a Giants practice session at Pace University in Pleasantville, New York. He was buried at Gulph United Church of Christ Cemetery in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.

Titus (1910) 157 Cal. 673Oakland Tribune, November 13, 1905 The Claremont Hotel Company was a group of investors that included Mr Titus, along with John Hopkins Spring, Francis \\"Borax\\" Smith, Frank C. Havens, and Duncan McDuffie.Oakland Berkeley City Directory 1906, p.105. Smith and Havens were already involved with what came to be known as the \\"Key System\\", a major transit and real estate development company in the East Bay, whose commuter trains began rolling in 1903. Construction of the hotel soon after the 1905 purchase, contemporaneously with the nearby Claremont Park development of Duncan McDuffie, but halted as a result of supply and financial difficulties caused by the 1906 earthquake. Construction resumed for a time in 1910, but further difficulties impeded progress. In the meantime, a referendum in November of 1909 brought the annexation of the area that included most of the hotel site into the city limits of Oakland. The hotel was finally completed and opened in 1915 as the Claremont Hotel. A transbay Key railway line (eventually designated the \\"E\\" line) ran nearly to the doors of the Claremont Hotel, ending between the tennis courts that are now part of the Berkeley Tennis Club. Thus, Claremont Hotel guests not only had views of San Francisco, but could go there directly from the lobby steps. The tracks were removed in 1958 when the Key System was dismantled, but the tennis courts are still separated by a path where the tracks used to be. The Key System constructed another large hotel near downtown Oakland, the Key Route Inn, which also had its own train service. Besides the direct rail connection, the Claremont Hotel was also convenient to vehicular traffic, as it was situated along the principal route over the Berkeley Hills via Claremont Canyon. In 1903, a small tunnel was excavated above Temescal Canyon (the next canyon southward), accessible by a new road dubbed Tunnel Road, which ran from the end of Ashby Avenue. The same route later led to a newer, larger tunnel which opened in 1937 as the \\"Broadway Low Level Tunnel\\", later re-named the Caldecott Tunnel. The street address of the Claremont is still 41 Tunnel Road. Tunnel Road is a designated part of State Highway 13. In 1873, a state law was enacted that prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages within two miles of the University of California.Statutes of California 1873-74, p.12 (jump to p.102 of the PDF) This statute was amended in 1876, reducing the prohibition distance to one mile (1.6 km) from the perimeter of the University of California.Statutes of California, Amendments, p.109 (jump to p.121 of the PDF) In 1913, the hotel's investors sponsored AB 1620 (known as the Ferguson bill), supposedly to further restrict alcohol near churches and schools statewide, but specifically excluding the Claremont Hotel from the dry zone. Influenced by activism from women's clubs and temperance groups in Berkeley, the Ferguson bill was defeated by one vote. Nationwide prohibition of alcohol was instituted on January 17, 1920, when the Volstead Act, enacted pursuant to the 18th Amendment, went into effect. On December 5, 1933, the 18th Amendment was repealed by enactment of the 21st Amendment. After repeal, the Claremont Hotel continued to suffer from the state law prohibiting the sale of liquor within a mile of the university. In 1937, the law was amended to measure the distance following street routes rather than a straight line, and the hotel was then able to serve liquor legally.California Penal Code Section 172. Subd. (d) was added in 1937. According to a story on the hotel‚Äôs website, a student at the University discovered in 1936 that the route was over a mile and was awarded free drinks for life. This point had been publicly discussed in 1913, however.Oakland Tribune, April 2, 1913, Page 4, column 3, comments by Mayor Mott of Oakland. The hotel had an unusual fire escape in the form of a multi- story spiral slide for guests to make their escape. Many people over the years, including teenagers, sneaked in and took the ride, but the slide was eventually boarded up and removed. On the final day the slide was opened up to the public and anybody making a donation to the hotel's selected charity was given a monogrammed terrycloth hand towel to slide down with. The Claremont faced destruction in the 1991 Oakland firestorm, but firefighters and the lessening wind stopped the flames short of the hotel. In 2007, the Claremont was acquired by Morgan Stanley. On February 1, 2011, the resort filed for bankruptcy due to losses attributed to the ongoing recession. Lenders including Paulson & Co., Winthrop Realty Trust and Capital Trust foreclosed on the property. In 2013, the owners reached a deal to sell the Claremont and three other properties to the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. The Claremont was purchased in March 2014 by the Fairmont Hotel chain and financier Richard Blum.  Reported haunting  The Claremont is reportedly haunted, particularly Room 422. Reports include the sound of a baby crying, but the story of the death of a six-year-old girl in that room has not been substantiated.

Lady of the Lake legend The glacial lake of Llyn y Fan Fach featured in the Lady of the Lake story The area is the setting for many tales of myth and legend. One such legend is the story of the Lady of the Lake. The story goes that a young farm boy grazing his sheep flock around the lake of Llyn y Fan Fach below the Black Mountain escarpment used to pass the long daylight hours gazing into the dazzling waters of the lake. As he grew up, passing every day this way, one day a beautiful woman emerged from this lake, approached the dumbstruck boy, who was instantly besotted and cast totally under her spell. She was unparalleled in beauty, grace and wisdom and immediately prophesied to him that he would become rich and respected if he would agree to marry her. However this future success and her partnership was dependent on certain conditions. Foremost condition was that he should never strike her more than three times. Secondly that he never speak a word of her origin or the supernatural source of their success and relationship. The boy very readily agreed and managed to suppress conjecture as to her sudden appearance ‚Äì no easy feat among a Welsh community. As she forecast, the young boy's flocks gained weight and condition and many healthy lambs were born, including exceptional breed rams, he became an astute negotiator at market, enjoyed haggling, kept his humour and his nerve, he secured excellent deals with older, shrewder farmers, won their gradual respect, expanded his flocks, bought his own land, rented land wisely, developed a skillful eye when buying, built up relationships with trusted peers, supported those coming up behind him, knew intuitively who to trust and whose word to discount, expanded into horse breeding and before many years had passed he was a farmer. A man who was welcome wherever he went, sought out by all. His quiet wife kept in the background and produced beautiful, healthy children, ran the household efficiently and was a constant support to her husband. For many years the couple were closely in love and they prospered and enabled their wider community to prosper in turn. However like many young men the boy grew complacent, maybe even arrogant on occasions, neglected old friends, old bonds and old values. This resulted in lost revenue, damaged friendships and a resultant backlash of stress, anger and disquiet. On one occasion he struck his wife as she met him from market. She reminded him of his promises to her and the foremost condition of their marriage. He begged her forgiveness, which she in turn readily gave. However this happened twice more in similar circumstances and on being struck the third time she stood up to her full height, looked him in the eye and stated that their relationship was now over. She simply turned on her heel and walked out of their farm and as she crossed their land every sheep, lamb, cow, calf, hen, chick, duck, goose, pig and horse followed her. She ascended to the lake and wordlessly walked in once more, every animal following her beneath the cold still waters, leaving the man heart broken in the shallows, his pleas resounding around the mountains arms. Another version of the tale, as told by Sir John Rhys in his book \\"Celtic Folklore, Volume 1: Welsh and Manx,\\" shows no worsening of the young man. Instead, the \\"blows\\" come to a light blow on the back with a pair of gloves, a warm hand at a wedding when the Lady is crying, and an admonishing hand at a funeral when the Lady is laughing. The story ends in a similar fashion, though, with the Lady calling all of her dowry of animals away with her. It is noted, further: \\"What became of the affrighted ploughman ‚Äì whether he was left on the field when the oxen set off, or whether he followed them to the lake, has not been handed down to tradition; neither has the fate of the disconsolate and half-ruined husband been kept in remembrance\\". The man returned to his farm unable to work the land, lost in a world of self-reproach and disbelief, a ruined man. His only compensation was his children by his otherworldly wife, who still loved him; they grew up to be the Physicians of Myddfai.Physicians of Myddfai - Magic and Medicine - The story Llwynywermwd In 2006, Charles, Prince of Wales started looking for a base for his visits to Wales. Carmarthenshire was seen as a favourite location due to its quiet nature. In late 2006, the Prince via the Duchy of Cornwall made an offer on Llwynywermwd (Llwynywormwood), a former coach house set in the grounds of a ruined mansion. Contracts were exchanged in November 2006, with Clarence House saying that the property may be let to holidaymakers when the Prince and Duchess were not there. Prince Charles made his first official visit on 16 March 2007.

Its sole broadcast was in Japan on December 16, 1997. In the episode, Ash and his friends find at the local Pok√©mon Center that there is something wrong with the Pok√© Ball transmitting device. To find out what is wrong, they must go inside the machine. The episode contained repetitive visual effects that induced photosensitive epileptic seizures in a substantial number of Japanese viewers, an incident referred to as the by the Japanese press. 685 viewers were taken to hospitals; two remained hospitalized for more than two weeks. The shares of Nintendo, the company that produced the games they were based on, fell about almost 5%. As a result of this incident, Nintendo ordered the episode pulled from rotation and has not been rebroadcast in any country since. References of Porygon and its evolutions are not present in future episodes. After the incident, the Pok√©mon anime went into a four-month hiatus, removing the TV Tokyo red circle logo and the „ÉÅ„É•„ÉÉ! text from the Japanese anime, and it returned on TV Tokyo on April 16, 1998. After that, the time slot changed from Tuesday to Thursday. Since then, the episode has been parodied and referenced in cultural media, including The Simpsons episode \\"Thirty Minutes over Tokyo\\" and the South Park episode \\"Chinpokomon\\". Plot Ash, Misty, Brock and Pikachu discover that the system used to transfer Pok√©mon from one Pok√©mon Center to the other is malfunctioning. On Nurse Joy's request, they go to Professor Akihabara, the one who created the Pok√© Ball transfer system. He tells them that Team Rocket stole his prototype Porygon, a digital Pok√©mon that can exist in cyberspace, and is using it to steal trainers' Pok√©mon from inside the computer system. Akihabara sends Ash, Misty, Brock, Pikachu and his second Porygon into the system to stop Team Rocket, whom they learn have set up a blockade that stops Pok√©balls from traveling the network. Porygon is able to defeat Team Rocket's Porygon, but Nurse Joy, monitoring the situation and unaware that Ash and the others are inside, has sent an anti-virus program into the system to combat the computer virus Team Rocket set up. Pikachu uses a Thunderbolt attack on the program, which manifests as \\"vaccine missiles\\", which causes an explosion. The group and Team Rocket successfully escape the computer, and with Team Rocket's blockade removed, the system returns to normal. Broadcast \\"Denn≈ç Senshi Porygon\\" aired once in Japan on December 16, 1997 at 6:30 PM Japan Standard Time (09:30 UTC). It was broadcast over 37 TV stations that Tuesday night. It held the highest ratings for its time slot and was watched by approximately 4.6 million households. Strobe lights Twenty minutes into the episode, Pikachu stops \\"vaccine\\" missiles with his Thunderbolt attack, resulting in an explosion that flashes red and blue lights. Although there were similar parts in the episode with red and blue flashes, two anime techniques, \\"paka paka\\" and \\"flash\\" made the scene particularly intense. These flashes were bright strobe lights, with blinks at a rate of about 12 Hz for approximately six seconds. At this point, some viewers experienced blurred vision, headaches, dizziness and nausea. Some suffered seizures, blindness, convulsions and loss of consciousness. Japan's Fire Defense Agency reported that 685 viewers ‚Äì 310 boys and 375 girls ‚Äì were taken to hospitals by ambulances. Although many victims recovered during the ambulance trip, more than 150 were admitted to hospitals. Two were hospitalized for more than two weeks. Some had seizures when parts of the scene were rebroadcast during news reports on the seizures. Only a small fraction of the 685 children treated were diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy. The incident was referred to as by the Japanese press. Later studies showed that 5‚Äì10% of the viewers had mild symptoms that did not need hospital treatment. Twelve thousand children who were not sent to hospital reported mild symptoms of illness; however, their symptoms more closely resembled mass hysteria than a grand mal seizure. A study following 103 patients over three years after the event found that most had no further seizures. Scientists believe that the flashing lights triggered photosensitive seizures in which visual stimuli such as flashing lights can cause altered consciousness. Although approximately 1 in 4,000 people are susceptible to these types of seizures, the number of people affected by the Pok√©mon episode was unprecedented. An article in USA Today reassured parents that American children were unlikely to suffer seizures provoked by cartoons as US networks at the time rarely aired anime, with its \\"fast-paced style of animation\\", though anime has since become more prevalent with the expansion of cable networks and streaming venues. The incident was included in the 2004 edition and the 2008 Gamer's Edition of the Guinness World Records book, holding the record for \\"Most Photosensitive Epileptic Seizures Caused by a Television Show\\". Aftermath News of the incident spread quickly through Japan as well as the headquarters of Nintendo, the company that produces the game it was based on. The following day the television station that had originated the lone broadcast of that episode, TV Tokyo, issued an apology to the Japanese public, suspended the program, and said it would investigate the cause of the seizures. Officers from Atago Police stations were ordered by Japan's National Police Agency to question the anime's producers about the show's contents and production process. An emergency meeting was held by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, in which the case was discussed with experts and information collected from hospitals. Video retailers all over Japan removed the Pok√©mon anime from their rental shelves. Reaction was swift on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and Nintendo's shares fell by 400 yen (almost 5%) the following morning to 12,200 yen. Then-president of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi, said at a press conference the day after the episode had aired that the video game company was not responsible since the original Pok√©mon game for its Game Boy product was presented in black and white. After the airing of \\"Denn≈ç Senshi Porygon\\", the Pok√©mon anime went into a four-month hiatus, and TV Tokyo removed the red circle logo and the „ÉÅ„É•„ÉÉ! text from the Pok√©mon Season 1: Indigo League Opening Credits & Ending Credits, The opening animation was redone, the lightning flash has been removed from the Dare da? segment, and rerun all 37 episodes of Pok√©mon Season 1: Indigo League on Kids Station in Tokyo, Japan, and they show the EP039 Pikachu's Goodbye Preview, until it returned on April 16, 1998 with airing of \\"Forest of Pikachu\\" (\\"Pikachu's Goodbye\\") and \\"The Four Eevee Brothers\\" (\\"The Battling Eevee Brothers\\"). After the hiatus, the time slot changed from Tuesday to Thursday. The opening theme was also redone, and black screens showing various Pok√©mon in spotlights were broken up into four images per screen and at the end of the opening animation, they show just the „ÉÜ„É¨„ÉìÊù±‰∫¨ text logo without the TV Tokyo red circle logo and without the „ÉÅ„É•„ÉÉ! text, eventually rebranding to its current logo shortly after in October 1 the same year. The Dare da? segment was also redone, it starts on the black screen without the lightning flash, and it continues on the blue screen without the lightning flash. Before the seizure incident, the opening was originally one Pok√©mon image per screen, the end of the opening animation was showing TV Tokyo red circle logo and the „ÉÅ„É•„ÉÉ! text, the Dare da? segenent still has the lightning flash. Before the resumption of broadcast, was shown. Broadcast in Japan on April 16, 1998, host Miyuki Yadama went over the circumstances of the program format and the on-screen advisories at the beginning of animated programs, as well as showing letters and fan drawings sent in by viewers, most of whom were concerned that the incident would lead to the anime being cancelled. Many Japanese television broadcasters and medical officials (along with the United Kingdom Independent Television Commission) came together to find ways to make sure the incident was not repeated. They established a series of guidelines for future animated programs, including: * Flashing images, especially those with red, should not flicker faster than three times per second. If the image does not have red, it still should not flicker faster than five times per second. * Flashing images should not be displayed for a total duration of more than two seconds. * Stripes, whirls and concentric circles should not take up a large part of the television screen. This episode kept the episodes \\"Rougela's Christmas\\" (\\"Holiday Hi-Jynx\\") and \\"Iwark as a Bivouac\\" (\\"Snow Way Out!\\") off their original broadcast date in Japan following the incident. Those two episodes were about to air after \\"Denn≈ç Senshi Porygon\\" on December 23, 1997 and January 6, 1998 respectively. They were eventually only aired on October 5, 1998 as an hour-long special. Airing out of order caused confusion to viewers because Ash still had a Charmander instead of Charizard, and Misty did not have Togepi yet, but Starmie and Horsea. Also, a New Year special was about to air between these episodes on December 30, 1997, but it was cancelled after TV Tokyo pulled any mention of Pok√©mon from their channel following the incident. To prevent any similar incidents from occurring, Yamauchi quickly ordered the episode pulled from circulation, and it has not aired since in any country. After the Pok√©mon incident, TV broadcasters voluntarily added on-screen warnings to shows targeted at young children encouraging viewers to watch anime in a well-lit room and to sit far away from the television set. The anime has not featured Porygon or its evolutions, Porygon-2 and Porygon-Z, in any subsequent episodes. Cultural impact The \\"Pok√©mon Shock\\" incident has been parodied many times in popular culture, including an episode of The Simpsons, \\"Thirty Minutes over Tokyo\\". In the episode, the Simpson family travels to Japan. When they arrive at their hotel in Tokyo, Bart is seen watching an anime entitled Battling Seizure Robots featuring robots with flashing eye lasers, and asks: \\"Isn't this that cartoon that causes seizures?\\", and the flashing eyes cause him to have a seizure. Marge and Lisa are also affected and Homer walks in seeing them all convulsing on the floor and joins in. The same scene is seen again in the episode's end credits, this time covering the entire screen. An episode of South Park that first aired in November 1999, \\"Chinpokomon\\", revolves around a Pok√©mon-like phenomenon, called Chinpokomon, with which the children of South Park become obsessed. Chinpokomon toys and video games are sold to American children in South Park by a Japanese company. The company's president, Mr. Hirohito, uses the toys to brainwash the American children, making them into his own army to topple the \\"evil\\" American \\"empire\\". These toys included a video game in which the player attempts to bomb Pearl Harbor. While playing this game, Kenny has an epileptic seizure and later dies, in reference to the Pok√©mon seizure incident. In the pilot episode of Drawn Together, Ling-Ling, who is a parody of Pikachu, states that his goal in the Drawn Together house is to \\"destroy all, and give children seizures\\". There follows a scene with flashing lights. In So Yesterday, a novel by Scott Westerfeld, this episode is mentioned and shown to one of the characters. The flashing red light that caused the seizure is also used in the storytelling elements.

It does not have an overseas division, so releases on it tend to be collectable outside of the United Kingdom. The label releases artists works from a wide variety of genres including noise, soundscape, breakcore, mashup and many more that don't fit comfortably into any genre. V/Vm Test Records are notable for their rebellious approach, often in the face of blatant copyright infringement, most notable are the artists V/Vm themselves, often taking a popular song and running it through various filters the end result being a de- tuned and distorted version of the original. The Sick Love album contains several notable examples of this style, as well as the frequent references to Pigs that colour most V/Vm releases. Notable acts on V/Vm Test have included: Jega, Kid606, Hell Interface (Boards of Canada), Kevin Blechdom, Goodiepal, Knifehandchop and Datach'i. V/Vm Test has been instrumental in giving away free and unrestricted downloads since 1997 on his website and via various V/Vm Test associated Microsites. In 2006 V/Vm set up an addition label, Vukzid and also a number of extra microsites which gave away free audio and visual content along with working on a unique daily project which saw the artist V/Vm record at least one piece of audio per day which was then uploaded and given away for free (for the whole of 2006).

During this period a system of patrimonial rule based on the absolute authority of the sultan reached its apex, and the empire developed the institutional foundations which it would maintain, in modified form, for several centuries. The territory of the Ottoman Empire greatly expanded, and led to what some historians have called the Pax Ottomana. The process of centralization undergone by the empire prior to 1453 was brought to completion in the reign of Mehmed II. Territory The Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the second reign of Mehmed II. The Ottoman Empire upon the death of Suleiman the Magnificent. The Ottoman Empire of the Classical Age experienced dramatic territorial growth. The period opened with the conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed II (r. 1451-1481) in 1453. Mehmed II went on to consolidate the empire's position in the Balkans and Anatolia, conquering Serbia in 1454-5, the Peloponnese in 1458-9, Trebizond in 1461, and Bosnia in 1463. Many Venetian territories in Greece were conquered during the 1463-79 Ottoman-Venetian War. By 1474 the Ottomans had conquered their Anatolian rival the Karamanids, and in 1475 conquered Kaffa on the Crimean Peninsula, establishing the Crimean Khanate as a vassal state. In 1480 an invasion of Otranto in Italy was launched, but the death of Mehmed II the following year led to an Ottoman withdrawal. The reign of Bayezid II (r. 1481-1512) was one of consolidation after the rapid conquests of the previous era, and the empire's territory was expanded only marginally. in 1484 Bayezid led a campaign against Moldavia, subjecting it to vassal status and annexing the strategic ports of Kilia and Akkerman. Major Venetian ports were conquered in Greece and Albania during the 1499-1503 war, most significantly Modon, Koron, and Durazzo. However, by the end of his reign, Ottoman territory in the east was coming under threat from the newly established Safavid Empire. Rapid expansion resumed under Selim I (r. 1512-1520), who defeated the Safavids in the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514, annexing much of eastern Anatolia and briefly occupying Tabriz. In 1516 he led a campaign against the Mamluk Sultanate, conquering first Syria and then Egypt the following year. This marked a dramatic shift in the orientation of the Ottoman Empire, as it now came to rule over the Muslim heartlands of the Middle East, as well as establishing its protection over the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. This increased the influence of Islamic practices on the government of the empire, and facilitated much greater interaction between the Arabic-speaking world and the Ottoman heartlands in Anatolia and the Balkans. Under Selim's reign the empire's territory expanded from roughly to . Expansion continued during the first half of the reign of Suleiman I (r. 1520-1566), who conquered first Belgrade (1521) and Rhodes, before invading Hungary in 1526, defeating and killing King Louis II in the Battle of Moh√°cs and briefly occupying Buda. Lacking a king, Hungary descended into civil war over the succession, and the Ottomans gave support to John Z√°polya as a vassal prince. When their rivals the Habsburgs began to achieve the upper hand, Suleiman directly intervened by again conquering Buda and annexing it to the empire in 1541. Elsewhere, Suleiman led major campaigns against Safavid Iran, conquering Baghdad in 1534 and annexing Iraq. Ottoman rule was further extended with the incorporation of much of North Africa, the conquest of coastal Yemen in 1538, and the subsequent annexation of the interior. After the annexation of Buda in 1541 the pace of Ottoman expansion slowed as the empire attempted to consolidate its vast gains, and became engrossed in imperial warfare on three fronts: in Hungary, in Iran, and in the Mediterranean. Additional conquests were marginal, and served to shore up the Ottoman position. Ottoman control over Hungary was expanded in a series of campaigns, and a second Hungarian province was established with the conquests of Teme≈üvar in 1552. Control over North Africa was increased with the conquest of Tripoli in 1551, while the Ottomans shored up their position in the Red Sea with the annexation of Massawa (1557) and the extension of Ottoman rule over much of coastal Eritrea and Djibouti. By the end of Suleiman's reign the empire's territory had expanded to approximately . Political history = 1451‚Äì1481: Mehmed II = The conquest of Constantinople allowed Mehmed II to turn his attention to Anatolia. Mehmed II tried to create a single political entity in Anatolia by capturing Turkish states called Beyliks and the Greek Empire of Trebizond in northeastern Anatolia and allied himself with the Crimean Khanate. Uniting the Anatolian Beyliks was first accomplished by Sultan Bayezid I, more than fifty years earlier than Mehmed II but after the destructive Battle of Ankara back in 1402, the newly formed Anatolian unification was gone. Mehmed II recovered the Ottoman power on other Turkish states. These conquests allowed him to push further into Europe. Another important political entity which shaped the Eastern policy of Mehmed II was the White Sheep Turcomans. With the leadership of Uzun Hasan, this Turcoman kingdom gained power in the East but because of their strong relations with the Christian powers like Empire of Trebizond and the Republic of Venice and the alliance between Turcomans and Karamanid tribe, Mehmed saw them as a threat to his own power. He led a successful campaign against Uzun Hasan in 1473 which resulted with the decisive victory of the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Otlukbeli. After the Fall of Constantinople, Mehmed would also go on to conquer the Despotate of Morea in the Peloponnese in 1460, and the Empire of Trebizond in northeastern Anatolia in 1461. The last two vestiges of Byzantine rule were thus absorbed by the Ottoman Empire. The conquest of Constantinople bestowed immense glory and prestige on the country. Miniature of Mehmed II Sword of Mehmed II Siege of Belgrade (in Hungarian: N√°ndorfeh√©rv√°r) 1456. H√ºnername 1584 Mehmed II advanced toward Eastern Europe as far as Belgrade, and attempted to conquer the city from John Hunyadi at the Siege of Belgrade in 1456. Hungarian commanders successfully defended the city and Ottomans retreated with heavy losses but at the end, Ottomans occupied nearly all of Serbia. In 1463, after a dispute over the tribute paid annually by the Bosnian kingdom, Mehmed invaded Bosnia and conquered it very quickly, executing the last Bosnian king Stephen Toma≈°eviƒá and his uncle Radivoj. In 1462 Mehmed II came into conflict with Prince Vlad III Dracula of Wallachia, who had spent part of his childhood alongside Mehmed. Vlad had ambushed, massacred or captured several Ottoman forces, then announced his impalement of over 23,000 captive Turks. Mehmed II abandoned his siege of Corinth to launch a punitive attack against Vlad in WallachiaMehmed the Conqueror and his time pp. 204‚Äì5 but suffered many casualties in a surprise night attack led by Vlad, who was apparently bent on personally killing the Sultan.Dracula: Prince of many faces: His life and his times p. 147 Confronted by Vlad's scorched earth policies and demoralizing brutality, Mehmed II withdrew, leaving his ally Radu cel Frumos, Vlad's brother, with a small force in order to win over local boyars who had been persecuted by Vlad III. Radu eventually managed to take control of Wallachia, which he administered as Bey, on behalf of Mehmet II. Vlad eventually escaped to Hungary, where he was imprisoned on a false accusation of treason against his overlord. In 1475, the Ottomans suffered a great defeat at the hands of Stephen the Great of Moldavia at the Battle of Vaslui. In 1476, Mehmed won a pyrrhic victory against Stephen at the Battle of Valea AlbƒÉ. He besieged the capital of Suceava, but could not take it, nor could he take the Castle of T√¢rgu Neam»õ. With a plague running in his camp and food and water being very scarce, Mehmed was forced to retreat. The Albanian resistance in Albania between 1443 and 1468 led by George Kastrioti Skanderbeg (ƒ∞skender Bey), an Albanian noble and a former member of the Ottoman ruling elite, prevented the Ottoman expansion into the Italian peninsula. Skanderbeg had united the Albanian Principalities in a fight against the Empire in the League of Lezh√´ in 1444. Mehmed II couldn't subjugate Albania and Skanderbeg while the latter was alive, even though twice (1466 and 1467) he led the Ottoman armies himself against Kruj√´. After death of Skanderbeg in 1468, Albanians couldn't find a leader to replace him and Mehmed II eventually conquered Kruj√´ and Albania in 1478. The final act of his Albanian campaigns was the troublesome siege of Shkodra in 1478‚Äì9, a siege Mehmed II led personally. Mehmed II invaded Italy in 1480. The intent of his invasion was to capture Rome and \\"reunite the Roman Empire\\", and, at first, looked like he might be able to do it with the easy capture of Otranto in 1480 but Otranto was retaken by Papal forces in 1481 after the death of Mehmed. After his death, he was succeeded by his son, Bayezid II. = 1481‚Äì1512: Bayezid II = When Bayezid II was enthroned upon his father's death in 1481, he first had to fight his younger brother Cem Sultan, who took Ineg√∂l and Bursa and proclaimed himself Sultan of Anatolia. After a battle at Yeni≈üehir, Cem was defeated and fled to Cairo. The very next year he returned, supported by the Mameluks, and took eastern Anatolia, Ankara and Konya but eventually he was beaten and forced to flee to Rhodes. Sultan Bayezid attacked Venice in 1499. Peace was signed in 1503, and the Ottomans gained the last Venetian strongholds on the Peloponnesos and some towns along the Adriatic coast. In the 16th century Mameluks and Persians under Shah Ismail I allied against the Ottomans. The war ended 1511 in favor of the Turks. Later that year, Bayezid's son Ahmet forced his father into making him regent. His brother Selim was forced to flee to Crimea. When Ahmet was about to be crowned the Janissaries intervened, killed the prince and forced Bayezid into calling Selim back and making him the sultan. Bayezid abdicated and he died immediately after leaving the throne. = 1512‚Äì1520: Selim I = During his reign, Selim I (so called Yavuz, the Grim) was able to expand the empire's borders greatly to the south and east. At the Battle of Chaldiran in eastern Anatolia in 1514, Ottoman forces under Sultan Selim I won a decisive victory against the Safavids, ensuring Ottoman security on their eastern front and leading to the conquest of eastern Anatolia and northern Iraq. He defeated the Mameluks and conquered most of Syria and Egypt, including the holy city of Jerusalem as well as Cairo, the residence of the Abbasid caliph.Alan Mikhail, God's Shadow: Sultan Selim, His Ottoman Empire, and the Making of the Modern World (2020) excerpt = 1520‚Äì1566: Suleiman the Magnificent = Suleiman the Magnificent first put down a revolt led by the Ottoman-appointed governor in Damascus. By August, 1521, Suleiman had captured the city of Belgrade, which was then under Hungarian control. In 1522, Suleiman captured Rhodes. On August 29, 1526 Suleiman defeated Louis II of Hungary at the Battle of Moh√°cs. In 1541 Suleiman annexed most of present-day Hungary, known as the Great Alf√∂ld, and installed Z√°polya's family as rulers of the independent principality of Transylvania, a vassal state of the Empire. While claiming the entire kingdom, Ferdinand I of Austria ruled over the so-called \\"Royal Hungary\\" (present-day Slovakia, North-Western Hungary and western Croatia), a territory which temporarily fixed the border between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans. The Shi'ite Safavid Empire ruled Persia and modern-day Iraq. Suleiman waged three campaigns against the Safavids. In the first, the historically important city of Baghdad fell to Suleiman's forces in 1534. The second campaign, 1548‚Äì1549, resulted in temporary Ottoman gains in Tabriz and Azerbaijan, a lasting presence in Van Province, and some forts in Georgia. The third campaign (1554‚Äì55) was a response to costly Safavid raids into the provinces of Van and Erzurum in eastern Anatolia in 1550-52. Ottoman forces captured Yerevan, Karabakh and Nakhjuwan and destroyed palaces, villas and gardens. Although Sulieman threatened Ardabil, the military situation was essentially a stalemate by the end of the 1554 campaign season.Max Scherberger, ‚ÄúThe Confrontation between Sunni and Shi‚Äôi Empires: Ottoman-Safavid Relations between the Fourteenth and the Seventeenth Centuries‚Äù in The Sunna and Shi'a in History: Division and Ecumenism in the Muslim Middle East ed. by Ofra Bengio & Meir Litvak (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011) (‚ÄúScherberger‚Äù), pp. 59-60. Tahmasp sent an ambassador to Suleiman's winter quarters in Erzurum in September 1554 to sue for peace.Mikheil Svanidze, ‚ÄúThe Amasya Peace Treaty between the Ottoman Empire and Iran (June 1, 1555) and Georgia,‚Äù Bulletin of the Georgian National Academy of Sciences, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 191-97 (2009) (‚ÄúSvanidze‚Äù), p. 192. Influenced at least in part by the Ottoman Empire's military position with respect to Hungary, Sulieman agreed to temporary terms.Svandze, pp. 193-94. The formal Peace of Amasya signed the following June was the first formal diplomatic recognition of the Safavid Empire by the Ottomans.Douglas E. Streusand, ‚Äò‚ÄôIslamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals (Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press, c. 2011), p. 50. Under the Peace, the Ottomans agreed to restore Yerevan, Karabakh and Nakhjuwan to the Safavids and in turn would retain Iraq and eastern Anatolia. Suleiman agreed to permit Safavid Shi‚Äôa pilgrims to make pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina as well as tombs of imams in Iraq and Arabia on condition that the shah abolished the taburru, the cursing of the first three Rashidun caliphs.Scherberger, p. 60. The Peace ended hostilities between the two empires for 20 years. Huge territories of North Africa up to west of Algeria were annexed. The Barbary States of Tripolitania, Tunisia and Algeria became provinces of the Empire. The piracy carried on thereafter by the Barbary pirates of North Africa remained part of the wars against Spain, and the Ottoman expansion was associated with naval dominance for a short period in the Mediterranean. First Siege of Vienna in 1529 Ottoman navies also controlled the Red Sea, and held the Persian Gulf until 1554, when their ships were defeated by the navy of the Portuguese Empire. The Portuguese would continue to contest Suleiman's forces for control of Aden. In 1533 Khair ad Din known to Europeans as Barbarossa, was made Admiral-in-Chief of the Ottoman navies who were actively fighting the Spanish navy. In 1535 the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V (Charles I of Spain) won an important victory against the Ottomans at Tunis, but in 1536 King Francis I of France allied himself with Suleiman against Charles. In 1538, the fleet of Charles V was defeated at the Battle of Preveza by Khair ad Din, securing the eastern Mediterranean for the Turks for 33 years. Francis I asked for help from Suleiman, then sent a fleet headed by Khair ad Din who was victorious over the Spaniards, and managed to retake Naples from them. Suleiman bestowed on him the title of beylerbeyi. One result of the alliance was the fierce sea duel between Dragut and Andrea Doria, which left the northern Mediterranean and the southern Mediterranean in Ottoman's hands.

He was born in Westford, Vermont, and later moved to Ballardvale section of Andover, Massachusetts. A one-time proponent of Georgist minarchism, he converted to individualist anarchism after associating with Benjamin Tucker. He was a firm believer in the promotion of individualist anarchism through education. He said \\"Anarchism has undertaken to change men's minds in one point by removing their faith in force\\" (Quasi-Invasion and the Boycott in Liberty, X, 2). He began a \\"Letter Writing Corps\\" in 1894 which targeted specific individuals, including newspapers, to familiarize others with the philosophical doctrine. He is known for translating two important anarchist works into English from German: Max Stirner's The Ego and Its Own and Paul Eltzbacher's Anarchism; exponents of the anarchist philosophy (also published by Dover with the title The Great Anarchists: Ideas and Teachings of Seven Major Thinkers). Byington was a cum laude graduate of the University of Vermont in 1891 and a member of the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa. He was considered a master of at least twelve languages, including classical languages. Paul specifically mentions his \\"some ability\\" in Arabic and Zulu, plus European languages. His writings included observations on new forms and changed usage of English words, publishing 25 articles in the journal American Speech from 1926-1946. However, he had a \\"handicap of speech\\" which made preaching difficult so despite his seminary training, he spent many years working as a proofreader. Over the course of sixty years he translated the Bible from original texts and entitled it The Bible in Living English. It was published posthumously in 1972 in New York by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society.

The station was off the air for almost a year between November 1966 and September 1967 while in the process of being sold. Easy listening remained the format at WVFM for almost three decades; the station changed its calls to WEZY in 1988. WEZY later evolved from pure Beautiful Music into Soft AC before changing to Smooth Jazz WSJT on July 1, 1995.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1995/RR-1995-06-23.pdfhttps://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/tampabay/doc/263114651.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS;=ABS:FT&type;=current&date;=Jun+20%2C+1995&author;=Fischer%2C+Roger&pub;=St.+Petersburg+Times&edition;=&startpage;=2.B.2.B&desc;=Tampa+Bay+is+in+store+for+some+Smooth+Jazz+Series%3A+RADIO+NOTES%3B+Entertainment =WiLD format= The kayfabe line is that the station was started by two friends, Josh and Brian, who had been drinking on Josh's father's boat claiming to have pirated radio waves. The duo bragged of their contraband and irregulated airwaves until they were bought and turned into what is now the station that is broadcast today. In reality, the station just had a very small budget to start with, often resulting in the same songs playing over and over again. Tone L≈çc's \\"Wild Thing\\" was the first song the station had played over the air. The fictional friends would claim to have allegiance toward the song during their drunken stupor and continued to play the song repeatedly over the course of days. For the first few days the station was on the air, the song continued to be played in an effort to spark word of mouth attention. At first, WLLD's musical direction included a balanced mix of hit-driven R&B;/Hip-Hop and Dance tracks, mostly to counter rival WFLZ-FM, a move that would pay off up until WBTP (WFLZ's sister station) debuted. Today, the station's playlist is atypical of most rhythmics as it consists of mostly hip- hop and R&B; hits, thus is considered to be a rhythmic crossover by \\"Billboard\\". It also has competition from Rhythmic-leaning Top 40/CHR WPOI, which debuted in July 2011. WLLD was located on the 98.7 frequency from May 15, 1998, until 5:00 p.m. on August 19, 2009, when it swapped frequencies with smooth jazz station WSJT (now the current WPBB). The first song played after the switch was Tone Loc's \\"Wild Thing\\", the same first song that was played when WLLD was first launched in 1998 when it was on the 98.7 frequency. On October 2, 2014, CBS Radio announced that it would trade all of their radio stations located in Charlotte and Tampa (including WLLD), as well as WIP (AM) in Philadelphia, to the Beasley Broadcast Group in exchange for 5 stations located in Miami and Philadelphia.CBS And Beasley Swap Philadelphia/Miami For Charlotte/Tampa from Radio Insight (October 2, 2014) The swap was completed on December 1, 2014. The \\"Original 12\\" These songs were part of the original line up at WLLD. As previously mentioned, the budgetary restrictions on the station limited the songs that were played on the air.

It is put on in late October or early November every year since 1999. The show got its title from being the \\"last damn show\\" before the world ended in Y2K; hence, in continuation with the world remaining unscathed. Past performers include Eminem, Lil Wayne, Destiny's Child, P. Diddy, Busta Rhymes, Bubba Sparxxx, Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz, Trick Daddy, Luke, Ludacris, Kanye West, and Twista among others. The concert was originally held at The St. Pete Times Forum, but is held in other locations, such as Tropicana Field. It has pulled in over 20,000 in attendance almost every year. On the evening of September 11, 1999, WLLD broadcast the Last Damn Show concert live from 6 to 11 p.m. Because WLLD did not censor profane language and other instances of indecency from the broadcast, the Florida Family Association filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Association wanted the FCC to revoke WLLD's license. The FCC fined WLLD owner Infinity Broadcasting (now the defunct CBS Radio) $7,000 the following year.Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture Infinity filed an appeal, but the FCC denied the appeal in 2004.http://transition.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2004/FCC-04-48A1.html WiLDsplash is the annual concert during spring break out on by WLLD in Clearwater Beach.

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of its second induction class in 1964. He was also named in 1969 to the NFL 1920s All-Decade Team. Born and raised in Cleveland, Michalske played college football, principally at the guard and fullback positions, for Hugo Bezdek's Penn State Nittany Lions from 1923 to 1925. He played professional football as a guard with the New York Yankees from 1926 to 1927 and with the Green Bay Packers from 1929 to 1935 and 1937. He led the Packers to three consecutive National Football League (NFL) championships from 1929 to 1931 and was selected seven times as a first-team All-Pro between 1927 and 1935. Michalske also had a long career as a football coach, including serving as Iowa State's head coach from 1942 to 1946 and as an assistant coach with Lafayette College (1936), the Green Bay Packers (1937), the Chicago Cardinals (1939), St. Norbert College (1940-1941), Baltimore Colts (1949), Baylor (1950-1952), Texas A&M; (1953), and Texas (1954). Early years Michalske was born in Cleveland in 1903. His father, August Michalske (1868-1932), was a German immigrant who worked in 1910 as a teamster and in 1920 as \\"draying\\" contractor. His mother, Anna (Becker) Michalske (1872-1952), was also a German immigrant. Michalske had three older brothers (Arthur, Charles, and George) and two older sisters (Elizabeth and Laura).1910 Census entry for August Michalske and family.

Source Information: Ancestry.com. 1920 United States Federal Census [database on-line].Cleveland city directories between 1907 and 1920 describe August Michalske as a \\"teaming contractor\\", \\"teamster\\", or \\"driver\\". He attended Cleveland's West High School where he starred in three sports. Penn State Michalske attended Pennsylvania State University where he played for Penn State Nittany Lions football team from 1923 to 1925. He played as a guard in 1923 and at halfback and guard in 1924. Partway through the 1925 season, Penn State coach Hugo Bezdek moved Michalske from guard to fullback. He scored both Penn State touchdowns in a 13‚Äì6 victory over Michigan State, and by the end of the year he was rated as \\"one of the greatest defensive fullbacks of the season.\\" Professional football =New York Yankees= Michalske began his professional football career in 1926 as a guard for the New York Yankees of the first American Football League. The following year, the Yankees joined the National Football League (NFL). Michalske appeared in 14 and 13 games, respectively, for the 1927 and 1928 Yankees teams that compiled records of 7-8-1 and 4-8-1. While with the Yankees, Michalske established him as one of the best linemen in the NFL, securing first-team All-Pro honors in both 1927 and 1928. =Green Bay Packers= In September 1929, Michalske signed a contract to play for the Green Bay Packers. By that time, he was already \\"rated as the best guard in the National Football league.\\" He appeared in all 13 games for the 1929 Packers team that compiled a 12-0-1 record and won the franchise's first NFL championship. After the season, Ernie Nevers rated Michalske the best player in the NFL, calling him a \\"wonder\\" and adding, \\"There's nobody like him on the college or professional field today.\\" Michalske was also selected as a consensus All-Pro for the 1929 season with first-team honors from Collyers Eye magazine, the Chicago Tribune, and the Green Bay Post-Gazette. In 1930, Michalske returned to the Packers and helped lead the team to its second consecutive NFL championship. He was described as \\"one of the outstanding players in the country,\\" and he was selected at the end of the season as a first-time All-Pro by the Green Bay Press-Gazette and Collyer's Eye. In 1931, Michalske led the Packers to an unprecedented third consecutive NFL championship. On November 1, 1931, Michalske returned an interception 80 yards for a touchdown to account for every point in a 6‚Äì2 victory over the Chicago Bears. At the end of the season, Michalske was selected as a first-team All-Pro on the official NFL All-Pro team and by the United Press and the Green Bay Press-Gazette. Michalske remained with the Packers for an additional five seasons from 1932 to 1935 and again in 1937. He was selected as a first-team All-Pro in 1934 by the Green Bay Press-Gazette and in 1935 by the NFL, Chicago Daily News, and Green Bay Press-Gazette. In 1935, Michalske became an assistant coach under head coach Curly Lambeau, adding those duties to his responsibilities as a player. He retired as a player and left the Packers after the 1935 season, but in August 1937, he signed a contract to return to the Packers as a player and assistant coach for the 1937 season. His playing career ended on October 31, 1937, when he sustained a back injury after allegedly being kicked by an opposing player in a game against the Detroit Lions; he was hospitalized in Detroit for several days after the game. He confirmed his retirement as a player in August 1938. Michalske was known by the nickname \\"Iron Mike\\" because despite playing 60 minutes a game, he missed only nine of 104 games during his tenure with the Packers, five of them following the back injury in his final season. He wore nine uniform numbers over his Packers career, the most by any player in team history: 19 (1932), 24 (1934), 28 (1931), 30 (1932), 31 (1933), 33 (1935), 36 (1929‚Äì30, 37), 40 (1935) and 63 (1934). Coaching career =1930s= Michalske began his coaching career as the line coach at Ashland College in Ohio during the 1928 and 1929 seasons. While serving as an assistant coach at Ashland, he was also an All-Pro player in the NFL for the Yankees in 1928 and Packers in 1929. In March 1936, Michalske returned to coaching as an assistant football coach under head coach Ernie Nevers at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. Nevers and Michalske led Lafayette to a 1‚Äì8 record in 1936. Michalske was an assistant coach for the Packers under Curly Lambeau during the 1935 and 1936 seasons. In late November 1937, Michalske returned to Lafayette College for his second year as the head coach of the basketball team. In September 1939, Michalske was reunited with Ernie Nevers who had taken over as head coach of the Chicago Cardinals. Michalske was hired as an assistant football coach and scout for the Cardinals. The 1939 Cardinals compiled a 1‚Äì10 record, and neither Nevers nor Michalske returned to the club in 1940. =1940s= In the spring of 1940, Michalske was hired as the track coach at St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin. He also served as the line coach for the St. Norbert football team in 1940 and 1941. He remained at St. Norbert for two years. During that time, the football team compiled records of 3-3-1 in 1940 and 6‚Äì2 in 1941. In August 1942, Michalske was hired as the line coach at Iowa State College. On October 14, 1942, he replaced Ray Donels as the head coach of the Iowa State football team. After mediocre seasons in 1942 and 1943, Michalske led Iowa State in 1944 to a 6‚Äì1‚Äì1 record (3‚Äì1‚Äì1 in conference) and a tie for second place in the Big Six Conference. The 1944 Iowa State team shut out Kansas (25‚Äì0) and Kansas State (14‚Äì0), ran up 288 rushing yards in a 19‚Äì6 victory over Nebraska, and suffered its sole loss to Oklahoma. Michalske remained head coach at Iowa State through the 1946 season, though his teams stumbled to records of 4‚Äì3‚Äì1 in 1945 and 2‚Äì6‚Äì1 in 1946. He resigned his position at Iowa State in February 1947. His overall record as head football coach at Iowa State was 18‚Äì18‚Äì3 (8‚Äì9‚Äì2 against conference opponents). In September 1947, Michalske joined the Packers' scouting staff. In April 1949, he was hired as an assistant coach with the Baltimore Colts of the All-America Football Conference. The 1949 Colts compiled a record of 1‚Äì11. =1950s= In February 1950, Michalske was hired as the line coach at Baylor in Waco, Texas. He spent three years at Baylor under head coach George Sauer, with whom Michalske had played in Green Bay. During Michalske's three years at Baylor, the Baylor football team compiled records of 7‚Äì3, 8‚Äì2‚Äì1, and 4‚Äì4‚Äì2. Michalske resigned from in December 1952, effective at the end of his contract in March 1953. In May 1953, Michalske was hired as the line coach at Texas A&M; in College Station, Texas. During Michalske's one-year tenure at Texas A&M;, the 1953 Aggies were led by head coach Raymond George and compiled a 4‚Äì5‚Äì1 record. In January 1955, he was hired by Texas as an assistant football coach on a one-year contract. He was the line coach for the 1955 and 1956 Texas teams that compiled 5‚Äì5 and 1‚Äì9 records under head coach Ed Price. Awards and honors Michalske received numerous honors and awards for his accomplishments as a football player. In 1964, he was inducted as part of the second class of inductees into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was the first guard to be inducted. In 1969, Michalske was selected by the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a guard on the NFL 1920s All-Decade Team. He was also inducted in 1970 with the first group of inductees into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame, and in 1971 he was inducted into the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame. Family and later years Michalske was married to Doris Luke (1907-2001) at Waukegan, Illinois, in October 1932. They had two daughters, Lee Ann and Melinda. Both daughters became school teachers in Wisconsin. In his later years, Michalske lived in De Pere, Wisconsin. He died at a Green Bay hospital in October 1983 at age 80. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Allouez, Wisconsin.

Harkness and his new company, the Orlando Street Railway, to place tracks and run cars on certain streets. When completed, its main line ran along Orange Avenue from Lake Ivanhoe, near the north city limits at the time, south to Lake Lucerne. It ran around the west side of Lake Lucerne, and made several turns west and south to the South Florida Fair Association's property. One branch ran from the Church Street Station of the South Florida Railroad east on Church Street across Orange Avenue to Magnolia Avenue (then Main Street), then south on Main Street to a Methodist Episcopal church, and another branch ran east on Central Avenue from Orange Avenue.Street Railway - Pocket History of Orlando Florida Service was ended by early 1893, and a citrus freeze in 1894 and 1895 devastated Orlando's economy and ensured that the company would not resume operations. The tracks were removed in late 1896 or 1897, being considered a public nuisance. Many plans were made, including an extension of the Sanford Traction Company from Sanford, but no other street railways have entered downtown Orlando since.

The fair commemorated the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city. Conceived as a way to energize a city hit hard by the Great Depression, it highlighted the progress that had been achieved in the Great Lakes region in the last 100 years and indicated the path for future progress. Covering over 135 acres of Cleveland's lakefront, it featured numerous attractions: rides, sideshows, botanical gardens, cafes, art galleries, and much more. Similar to the Chicago World's Fair, the exposition also wanted to expose visitors to other countries' cultures, celebrate American industry, and promote local businesses. Although the Great Lakes Exposition was not as much of a world fair as the Chicago World's Fair was, the exposition drew 4 million visitors in its first season, and 7 million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937.  Construction  Frank J. Ryan and Lincoln G. Dickey, Cleveland's first public hall commissioner came up with the idea of the exposition. Dudley S. Blossom, a local philanthropist, became chairman of a civic committee and contributed $1.5 million to transform the idea into reality. The exposition was built quickly in just 80 days because of the available labor from the Works Progress Administration, and opened on June 27, 1936 for 100 days. A prominent entrance was at the north end of East 9th Street. The 135 acres incorporated the mall area, public hall, and municipal stadium, and featured a subway that connected the vast grounds with an area for pedestrians as well as for vehicles. The total cost of the exposition after two years was $70 million.  Attractions  = Midway = The Midway was a big, central area in the exposition and encompassed many of the attractions including rides, sideshows, a Court of Presidents, an Automotive building, an art gallery, a marine theater, horticultural gardens, and a Hall of Progress, which had a television theater. Some of the more unique attractions in the midway were Admiral Byrd's polar expedition ship the \\"City of New York\\". The City was on show for the full length of the exhibition. The \\"Custer Car Speedway,\\" a Venetian boat swing, and a \\"Ripley's Believe it or Not Odditorium\\" where oddities were displayed and sold. = Aquacade = Added in the second year of the exhibition in 1937, the Aquacade put on water ballet shows and was the most popular attraction. Stretched out to Lake Erie, the aquacade had a 5000-seat theater-restaurant where the audience could dine while watching synchronized swimming, diving, and performances by Olympic champion swimmers Eleanor Holm and Johnny Weissmuller. The show featured 4 episodes: \\"A Beach in California,\\" \\"Coney Island,\\" \\"A Beach in Florida,\\" and \\"The Shores of Lake Erie\\". Although it was the most popular attraction at the Great Lake Exposition, it became more well known at the 1939 New York World's Fair. = \\"Streets of the World\\" = The \\"Streets of the World\\" was an exhibit created to expose visitors to other countries' cultures and featured cafes and bazaars inspired by the countries they represented. Food samples, entertainment, and goods from 40+ different countries were all provided on the \\"Streets of the World\\". = Business Exhibits = To promote their businesses, companies like White Motor Company, Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company, Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, Sherwin Williams, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Higbee's department store, and General Electric were represented at the exposition. Standard Oil had its very own exhibit and provided souvenir maps of the city, Higbee's had a store on sight and an impressive tower, General Electric promoted its new fluorescent lights, and Goodyear provided blimp rides for visitors at the cost of $3. = Crazy Exhibits = The exposition also feature some exhibits that would be considered today as politically incorrect including 260 pound ballerinas, a midget circus, a recreation of old Southern plantation life, and nude cancan dancers, who were eventually banned. Torso Murder Death Mask on exhibit = Celebrities = Celebrities were also present at the exposition to entertain visitors. Besides Olympic champion swimmers Eleanor Holm and Johnny Weissmuller who performed in the aquacade, track and field Olympian and hometown hero Jesse Owens, the world's most famous munchkin (although not famous from the Wizard of Oz yet) Meinhardt Raabe, Rudy Vallee and his band, Al Tomaini, and Jimmy Durante were also at the exposition. = Other = Another attraction was a floating stage on the current site of the Great Lakes Science Center; the stage was home to jazz concerts by the Bob Crosby Orchestra. Renoir, Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando on show at the exhibition  Post Exposition  The exposition was dismantled quickly, taken down right after closing day on September 26, 1937. Only the Donald Gray Gardens were left standing behind Cleveland Stadium until 1997 when FirstEnergy Stadium was starting construction. The total number of visitors after both summers was 7 million (compared to Chicago's exposition of 27 million total visitors) and was less than hoped for. Any plans for permanent recreation facilities along the lakeside were not achieved.  Conclusion  Although the Great Lakes Exposition gained some international attention, it never became a world fair. The area of town that was used for the vast exposition is now home to the Great Lakes Science Center, the Cleveland Browns Stadium, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Legacy In October 2010, the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. opened an exhibition titled Designing Tomorrow: America‚Äôs World‚Äôs Fairs of the 1930s. This exhibition, which was available for view until September 2011, prominently featured the Great Lakes Exposition.

The holomorph provides interesting examples of groups, and allows one to treat group elements and group automorphisms in a uniform context. In group theory, for a group G, the holomorph of G denoted operatorname{Hol}(G) can be described as a semidirect product or as a permutation group. Hol(G) as a semi-direct product If operatorname{Aut}(G) is the automorphism group of G then :operatorname{Hol}(G)=Grtimes operatorname{Aut}(G) where the multiplication is given by :(g,alpha)(h,beta)=(galpha(h),alphabeta). [Eq. 1] Typically, a semidirect product is given in the form Grtimes_{phi}A where G and A are groups and phi:Arightarrow operatorname{Aut}(G) is a homomorphism and where the multiplication of elements in the semi-direct product is given as :(g,a)(h,b)=(gphi(a)(h),ab) which is well defined, since phi(a)in operatorname{Aut}(G) and therefore phi(a)(h)in G. For the holomorph, A=operatorname{Aut}(G) and phi is the identity map, as such we suppress writing phi explicitly in the multiplication given in [Eq. 1] above. For example, * G=C_3=langle xrangle={1,x,x^2} the cyclic group of order 3 * operatorname{Aut}(G)=langle sigmarangle={1,sigma} where sigma(x)=x^2 * operatorname{Hol}(G)={(x^i,sigma^j)} with the multiplication given by: :(x^{i_1},sigma^{j_1})(x^{i_2},sigma^{j_2}) = (x^{i_1+i_22^{^{j_1}}},sigma^{j_1+j_2}) where the exponents of x are taken mod 3 and those of sigma mod 2. Observe, for example :(x,sigma)(x^2,sigma)=(x^{1+2cdot2},sigma^2)=(x^2,1) and this group is not abelian, as (x^2,sigma)(x,sigma)=(x,1), so that operatorname{Hol}(C_3) is a non-abelian group of order 6, which, by basic group theory, must be isomorphic to the symmetric group S_3. Hol(G) as a permutation group A group G acts naturally on itself by left and right multiplication, each giving rise to a homomorphism from G into the symmetric group on the underlying set of G. One homomorphism is defined as Œª: G ‚Üí Sym(G), Œª(g)(h) = g¬∑h. That is, g is mapped to the permutation obtained by left-multiplying each element of G by g. Similarly, a second homomorphism œÅ: G ‚Üí Sym(G) is defined by œÅ(g)(h) = h¬∑g‚àí1, where the inverse ensures that œÅ(g¬∑h)(k) = œÅ(g)(œÅ(h)(k)). These homomorphisms are called the left and right regular representations of G. Each homomorphism is injective, a fact referred to as Cayley's theorem. For example, if G = C3 = {1, x, x2 } is a cyclic group of order three, then * Œª(x)(1) = x¬∑1 = x, * Œª(x)(x) = x¬∑x = x2, and * Œª(x)(x2) = x¬∑x2 = 1, so Œª(x) takes (1, x, x2) to (x, x2, 1). The image of Œª is a subgroup of Sym(G) isomorphic to G, and its normalizer in Sym(G) is defined to be the holomorph N of G. For each n in N and g in G, there is an h in G such that n¬∑Œª(g) = Œª(h)¬∑n. If an element n of the holomorph fixes the identity of G, then for 1 in G, (n¬∑Œª(g))(1) = (Œª(h)¬∑n)(1), but the left hand side is n(g), and the right side is h. In other words, if n in N fixes the identity of G, then for every g in G, n¬∑Œª(g) = Œª(n(g))¬∑n. If g, h are elements of G, and n is an element of N fixing the identity of G, then applying this equality twice to n¬∑Œª(g)¬∑Œª(h) and once to the (equivalent) expression n¬∑Œª(g¬∑h) gives that n(g)¬∑n(h) = n(g¬∑h). That is, every element of N that fixes the identity of G is in fact an automorphism of G. Such an n normalizes Œª(G), and the only Œª(g) that fixes the identity is Œª(1). Setting A to be the stabilizer of the identity, the subgroup generated by A and Œª(G) is semidirect product with normal subgroup Œª(G) and complement A. Since Œª(G) is transitive, the subgroup generated by Œª(G) and the point stabilizer A is all of N, which shows the holomorph as a permutation group is isomorphic to the holomorph as semidirect product. It is useful, but not directly relevant, that the centralizer of Œª(G) in Sym(G) is œÅ(G), their intersection is œÅ(Z(G)) = Œª(Z(G)), where Z(G) is the center of G, and that A is a common complement to both of these normal subgroups of N.

History =1974 origin= RTA was created after a referendum in 1974. In 1973, CTA had instituted its first major service cuts,Bill Vandervoort, Significant Dates in CTA Route History. A paper by Ian Savage of the Department of Economics and the Transportation Center, Northwestern University, Management objectives and the causes of mass transit deficits (November, 2002), p. 15, outlines some of the reasons for the CTA's loss of profitability during this period. and several suburban bus companies, including Evanston Bus Company and Glenview Bus Company had ceased operations, forcing Evanston to make arrangements with CTA and Wilmette to start a municipal service. The Rock Island and Milwaukee Road were already facing financial distress, which would lead to their eventual bankruptcy, and the Illinois Central was petitioning the Interstate Commerce Commission to increase commuter fares, on the basis that the cost of operating its commuter train system was a burden on interstate commerce. While several suburbs had organized Mass Transit Districts to purchase equipment for the carriers with federal financial assistance, the Rock Island was still operating old equipment that it could not replace. In an attempt to deal with these problems in the six-county area, the RTA was established, with some taxing powers, to provide financial support through grants to the CTA and suburban mass transit districts, and purchase of service agreements with the private bus and rail operators.See also, Krambles and Peterson, CTA at 45: A History of the First 45 Years of the Chicago Transit Authority (1993), pp. 36 to 38. . =1983 reorganization= In 1983, after a financial crisis,Savage, pp. 16-17, attributes the problem to the unconstrained demand for subsidies, and the RTA's loss of financial viability due to unreliable taxing authority. Krambles, p. 38, also notes unspecified political problems; Chicago-l.org describes some of them. The extent of the crisis is partially described in two court cases reflecting the RTA's inability to meet obligations to suburban carriers: Regional Transportation Authority v.

Illinois Commerce Commission, 118 Ill.App.3d 685, 455 N.E.2d 172, 74 Ill.Dec. 142 (1st Dist., 1983). Some contemporaneous reports are also contained in the New York Times transit system news topics. and the RTA taking over several private bus companies and the Rock Island and Milwaukee Road lines, the RTA Act was amended to create the Suburban Bus Division, now known as Pace,70 ILCS 3615/3A.01. and the Commuter Rail Division, now known as Metra.70 ILCS 3615/3B.01. RTA's role then changed, so that it is now responsible for reviewing the operating and capital plans and expenditures of the Service Boards,70 ILCS 3615/2.01(b). developing an annual budget and program70 ILCS 3615/4.01(a). as well as a five-year plan,70 ILCS 3615/2.01(c). and distributing sales tax receipts to the Service Boards, in accordance with a statutory formula.The 1983-2007 formula was contained in 70 ILCS 3615/4.01(d). However, RTA no longer provides service directly, as the Service Boards have the authority to determine the level, nature, and kind of public transportation to be provided, 70 ILCS 3615/2.01(a). and to establish fares.70 ILCS 3615/2.04. Originally, RTA entered into purchase of service agreements with carriers, but the 1983 amendment gives the Service Boards the power to enter into those agreements with transportation agencies.70 ILCS 3615/2.02. The 1983 legislation also imposed the requirements that the level of fares must be sufficient, in the aggregate, to equal 50 percent of the cost of providing transportation,70 ILCS 3615/4.01(b)(i), subject to some exceptions for costs of security and the like. and that the RTA Board inform each Service Board, as part of the budget process, of its required recovery ratio for the next fiscal year.70 ILCS 3615/4.11(a). Savage, p. 17, attributes this condition to the need to prevent the continuation of the trend of the 1970s. =2004‚Äì2007 funding debate and 2008 legislation= Background In 2004, the CTA, projecting a $55 million funding shortfall in its 2005 budget, called for a \\"long term funding solution,\\" involving a change to the sales tax distribution formula in the RTA Act.See keepchicagolandmoving.com, a CTA web site . In response, the Illinois General Assembly appropriated $54 million to cover the cost of CTA's paratransit service for 2005.Announcement at juliehamos.org . An amendment to the RTA Act made the RTA responsible for the funding, financial review and oversight of all ADA paratransit services, effective July 1, 2005, and transferred responsibility for operating or providing for the operation of paratransit service to Pace starting July 1, 2006,70 ILCS 3615/2.30, as added by HB1663, 94th General Assembly. 70 ILCS 3615/4.01(b)(ii) establishes a recovery ratio for paratransit service. thereby relieving the CTA of that responsibility. The General Assembly also directed the Illinois Auditor General to audit the RTA and the Service Boards, as part of its review of the funding issue.HR0479, 94th General Assembly for the audit of CTA; HR0650, 94th General Assembly for RTA, Metra, and Pace. The Auditor General's preliminary report, while agreeing that public funding was insufficient to support the level of transit services, said that the legislature must address other issues, including underfunded pensions, high salaries, absenteeism, and the lack of strong, centralized planning, resulting in several of the service boards competing for customers in the same areas, the Auditor General calling for \\"an end to the transit agencies fighting each other for customers, routes and federal funding for pet projects that may not fit into an overall regional transit plan.\\" The RTA approved 2007 Service Board budgets premised on the assumption that \\"a new funding source would be identified in 2007 to meet the funding requirements of [the] budget.\\" Similarly the Pace 2007 Suburban Service Budget stated that its budget was balanced using \\"new transit funds anticipated to be realized through the Region‚Äôs Moving Beyond Congestion initiative.\\" The Metra Budget stated: \\"We have been advised by the Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) to prepare a 2007 budget that anticipates additional operations funding from the state. Although such funding is essential, we have no guarantee that it will be forthcoming.\\" Nonetheless, the CTA budget recognized, \\"Without this new funding source, CTA will be forced to cut service.\\" With no legislative action by August, 2007, CTA and Pace announced proposals for service cuts, popularly known as \\"Doomsday Plans,\\" to be implemented September 16. The September plans were postponed when the Governor proposed advancing 2008 state subsidies. A new Doomsday date was set for November 4, but that was avoided when the Governor engineered a transfer of capital funds. Again, the legislature having failed to pass a transit bill, the three service boards proposed 2008 budgets that assumed no new funding and postulated service cuts by CTA and Pace, and the deferral of capital projects by Metra, as well as fare increases by all three agencies. The barriers to 2007 passage of a bill were the requirement that a 3/5ths supermajority of the legislators was needed to pass a bill after May 31 to be immediately effective,Illinois Constitution, Article 4 Section 10. the Governor had threatened to veto a bill that included a sales tax increase, and many legislators tied a transit bill to a capital plan and a casino bill to fund that capital plan. However, with a new Doomsday deadline of January 20, 2008 approaching, the Governor called on the legislature to pass some bill, and he would \\"improve it,\\" presumably using the amendatory veto.The amendatory veto is authorized by Illinois Constitution Article 4 Section 9. The Legislature passed HB656 on January 10, to which the Governor affixed an amendatory veto allowing senior citizens to ride all transit systems in the state for free. Although various media reports expressed concern that the legislation could not receive the votes to sustain it after it was returned with the amendment, the amendatory veto was accepted and the legislation passed on January 17, 2008. Legislative response The highlights of the 2008 amendments to the RTA Act include: * The RTA sales tax was increased to 1.25% in Cook County, and 0.75% in the collar counties (from 1% and 0.25%, respectively), but one-third of the sales tax collected in the collar counties (i.e. 0.25%) is distributed directly to the counties70 ILCS 3615/4.03. and the county boards may use that money for transportation or public safety purposes.70 ILCS 3615/4.03.3. * A new distribution of revenues is prescribed, essentially leaving the distribution of the sales taxes collected at the old rates as is (by references to \\"85% of 80% of the receipts from those taxes collected within the City of Chicago\\" and the like) and then, after certain funds described below are set aside, the remainder is allocated 48% to CTA, 39% to Metra and 13% to Pace. * The Act requires that the RTA establish an Innovation, Coordination, and Enhancement Fund,70 ILCS 3615/2.01c. an ADA Paratransit Fund,70 ILCS 3615/2.01d. and a Suburban Community Mobility Fund.70 ILCS 3615/2.01e. * The Act calls for the implementation of an Interstate 55 bus rapid transit project and allocates money for programs to enhance access to job markets for residents in south suburban Cook County.70 ILCS 3615/2.09. * Upon the vote of 9 Directors of the RTA, the Executive Director may intervene in a dispute among service boards or transportation agencies.70 ILCS 3615/2.12b. * On the vote of 12 Directors, the RTA may take over an alternatives analysis and preliminary environmental assessment of a project where multiple Service Boards or transportation agencies are potential service providers.70 ILCS 3615/2.01a. * The RTA must establish Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Contracting and Equal Employment Opportunity Programs.70 ILCS 3615/2.31. * The RTA70 ILCS 3615/3.01. and Metra70 ILCS 3615/3B.02. boards were reapportioned, effective April 1, 2008, with the most significant changes being that the chair of the CTA may no longer be on the RTA board, and the President of the Cook County Board was given an appointment to the RTA and Metra boards, respectively. In addition, the legislation amended various other laws to deal with underfunding of the CTA Retirement Plan,e.g., 40 ILCS 5/22-101. and authorized the Chicago City Council to raise the real estate transfer tax for the sole benefit of the CTA,65 ILCS 5/8-3-19. which it did. =Reform proposals= Since the 2008 changes, there have been several proposals to reform the region's transit agencies more dramatically. In the wake of Metra's 2013 patronage scandal, state senators Daniel Biss and Terry Link introduced a bill to merge the RTA with the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. At the same time, Governor Pat Quinn convened the Northeastern Illinois Public Transit Task Force to study potential reforms - this group concluded that Metra, the CTA, and Pace should be consolidated into one agency. (Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel opposed consolidation as reducing accountable to voters.) In 2014 a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development also recommended combining Metra, the CTA, and Pace to improve coordination.

Early life Henry Hubbard was born on May 3, 1784, in Charlestown, New Hampshire in the United States. Hubbard was educated at home, and engaged in classical studies whilst taught by private tutors, before attending Dartmouth College and graduating from there in 1803. He studied law in Portsmouth with Jeremiah Mason, and was admitted to the New Hampshire bar around 1806. That year, he began practicing law in Charlestown. Hubbard married Sally Walker Dean in 1813; together, they would have 5 children. In 1818, Hubbard purchased 50 shares of the Suffolk Bank, a clearinghouse bank on State Street in Boston. Political career In 1810, Hubbard entered politics for the first time, and was elected to the position of Town Moderator; by the end of his life, he would be elected Town Moderator sixteen times. In 1812, Hubbard became a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, and served until 1814, as well as from 1819 to 1820, and 1823 to 1827.

Hubbard gained the Democratic nomination for Governor of New Hampshire, and was elected by popular vote in 1842, winning re-election in 1843. As Governor, Hubbard \\"favored lowering high national protective tariffs, denounced capital punishment, and called for state legislation to curb corporate shareholder profits made at the public expense.\\" He also argued that women who owned property should be given a tax reduction. Later life Hubbard was the subtreasurer in Boston from 1846 to 1849, afterwards returning to Charlestown to practice law. He died there on June 5, 1857, and was interred in Forest Hill Cemetery.

He was elected to the Royal Society on 17 November 1791 and served as President of the Royal Society from 1827 to 1830. He changed his name to Gilbert in 1817. Biography Davies Giddy was born on 6 March 1767, the second of the three children of Reverend Edward Giddy, curate of St Erth's church, and his wife Catherine, daughter of Henry Davies of Tredrea, St Erth in Cornwall. His parents' first child, also Davies by forename, died within 24 hours of birth in 1766, and their third child, Mary Philippa Davies Giddy (known as Philippa) was born in 1769.Cornwall On- line Parish Clerks The Giddy family moved to Penzance, living on Chapel Street in 1775, until Giddy's mother Catherine inherited the family home of Tredrea back in St Erth. By 1780 the family returned to St Erth, and Davies was taught by his father, alongside his sister Philippa. Davies Giddy would later adopt Gilbert as his surname, the maiden name of his wife, the agronomist Mary Ann Gilbert, whom he married at Easter of 1808. Davies was educated first at Penzance Grammar School and then by his father, and by Rev Malachy Hitchins,The West Briton, 3 January 1840 \\"Death of Davies Gilbert Esq.\\" ‚Äì quotation:\\"His preliminary education was conducted at home; and at a very early age he contracted an intimacy, which continued until death, with the Rev. Malachy Hitchens, vicar of St. Hilary, a gentleman of high and well- deserved celebrity as a mathematician and astronomer, and as editor of the Nautical almanack.\\" the mathematical astronomer. At the age of 17, at the recommendation of Hitchins, he was sent to Bristol to join the Mathematical Academy of Benjamin Donne where he remained for three years. His sister Philippa simultaneously finished her own schooling with the famous bluestocking Hannah More.A C Todd Beyond the Blaze He went up to Pembroke College, Oxford in 1786, whence he graduated with a MA on 29 June 1789. Davies was High Sheriff of Cornwall from 1792 to 1793. He served in the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Helston in Cornwall from 1804 to 1806 and for Bodmin from 1806 to 1832. Giddy was an intimate friend of physician Thomas Beddoes, had attended Beddoes' lectures at Oxford when Beddoes had become University Reader in Chemistry in 1788 and had been a confidant of Beddoes in his plans for the Pneumatic Institution in Bristol. He noticed and encouraged Humphry Davy and convinced Beddoes that Davy was the man to work in the laboratory at the Institution. The Dictionary of National Biography article says of him: > \\"Gilbert's importance to the development of science in the early nineteenth > century lay in his faith that science provided the best means to tackle > practical problems and in his facility as a parliamentary promoter of > scientific ventures.\\" His mathematical skills were sought by early engineering pioneers such as Jonathan Hornblower, Richard Trevithick and Thomas Telford. He also had an interest in the history and culture of Cornwall. For instance, he removed a Celtic cross from near Truro, on the Redruth Road (where it had found new use as a gatepost), and took it to a churchyard in his new home of Eastbourne.Website of Eastbourne Pagan Circle accessed 28 October 2006 When asked why he carried off a Cornish Cross and re-erected it in Eastbourne by the Rev. Canon Hockin, of Phillack, Davies replied, It was to show the poor, ignorant folk that there was something bigger in the world than a flint! He assembled and published A Parochial History of Cornwall and collected and published a number of Cornish Carols.A Parochial History of Cornwall : This book provides the first written evidence of the use of Saint Piran's Flag.hymns and Carols for Christmas website He edited for publication a Cornish Language poem about the Passion: Passyon agan Arluth, as Mount Calvary (1826). He was elected to the Society of Antiquaries in 1820. Gilbert was the President of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall from its foundation in 1814 until his death. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832. Davies Gilbert was opposed to mass education during his time in parliament. When the Parochial Schools Bill of 1807 was debated in the Commons, Tory MP Davies Gilbert warned the House that: > \\"However specious in theory the project might be of giving education to the > labouring classes of the poor, it would, in effect, be found to be > prejudicial to their morals and happiness; it would teach them to despise > their lot in life, instead of making them good servants in agriculture and > other laborious employments to which their rank in society had destined > them; instead of teaching them the virtue of subordination, it would render > them factious and refractory, as is evident in the manufacturing counties; > it would enable them to read seditious pamphlets, vicious books and > publications against Christianity; it would render them insolent to their > superiors; and, in a few years, the result would be that the legislature > would find it necessary to direct the strong arm of power towards them and > to furnish the executive magistrates with more vigorous powers than are now > in force.

Gortyna (), or Gortyn (ŒìŒøœÅœÑœçŒΩ), was a town of ancient Crete which appears in the Homeric poems, under the form of ŒìŒøœÅœÑœçŒΩ; but afterwards became usually Gortyna (ŒìœåœÅœÑœÖŒΩŒ±). According to Stephanus of Byzantium it was originally called Larissa (ŒõŒ¨œÅŒπœÉœÉŒ±) and Cremnia or Kremnia (ŒöœÅŒÆŒºŒΩŒπŒ±). History This important city was next to Cnossus in importance and splendour; in early times these two great towns had entered into a league which enabled them to reduce the whole of Crete under their power; in after- times when dissensions arose among them they were engaged in continual hostilities. It was originally of very considerable size, since Strabo reckons its circuit at 50 stadia; but when he wrote it was very much diminished. He adds that Ptolemy Philopator had begun to enclose it with fresh walls; but the work was not carried on for more than 8 stadia. In the Peloponnesian War, Gortyna seems to have had relations with Athens. In 201 BC, Philopoemen, who had been invited over by the inhabitants, assumed the command of the forces of Gortyna.Plutarch Phil. 13. In 197 BC, five hundred of the Gortynians, under their commander, Cydas, which seems to have been a common name at Gortyna, joined Quinctius Flamininus in Thessaly. Gortyna stood on a plain watered by the river Lethaeus, and at a distance of 90 stadia from the Libyan Sea, on which were situated its two harbours, Lebena and Metallum, and is mentioned by numerous ancient writers -- Pliny the Elder,, the author of the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax, Ptolemy, and Hierocles, who commenced his tour of the island with this place. In the neighbourhood of Gortyna, the fountain of Sauros is said to have been surrounded by poplars which bore fruits;Theophrast. H. P. 3.5. and on the banks of the Lethaeus was another famous spring, which the naturalists said was shaded by a plane-tree, which retained its foliage through the winter, and which the people believed to have covered the marriage-bed of Europa and the metamorphosed Zeus.Theophrast. H. P. 1.15; Varr. de Re Rustic. 1.7; The site of Gortyna is at modern Gortyn, where extensive ruins of the ancient town remain. It is a major archaeological site in Crete. Archaeology Excavations of Gortyn were begun in 1884 by the Italian School of Archaeology at Athens. The excavations showed that Gortyn was inhabited from the Neolithic age. Ruins of a settlement on the citadel of Gortyn, were discovered and dated back to 1050 BC, their collapse dating to the seventh century BC. Later the area was fortified with a wall. At the top of the hill in the citadel a temple was found dating to the 7th century BC. In this area two embossed plates were found, along with several other sculptures and paintings. Daedalic plastic and many other clay figurines, black figure and red figure paintings and plenty of pottery, especially the type called kernos, were found in the temple. Graves dating to the geometric age were found on the south side of the citadel. Regarding the lower town, the excavation uncovered the position of the Agora (market) and the temple of Pythian Apollo, which is 600 meters from the Agora. At the foot of Prophet Elias are traces of a sanctuary of Demeter. Monuments Detail of the ancient Odeon Saint Titus Basilica The heart of Roman Gortyn is the Praetorium, the seat of the Roman Governor of Crete. The Praetorium was built in the 1st century AD, but it was altered significantly over the next eight centuries. In the same area, between the Agora and the temple of Apollo are the ruins of the Roman baths (thermae), as well as the temple of Apollo, an honorary arch, and the temple of the Egyptian deities with the worship statues of Isis, Serapis and Anubis. Parts of the Roman settlement, such as the theater (2nd century AD), have been unearthed during excavations. The theater has two entrances and a half-circular orchestra, the outline of which may still be seen today. Behind the Roman Theater are what has been called the \\"Queen of the Inscriptions\\". These inscriptions are the laws of the city of Gortyn, which are inscribed in the Dorian dialect on large stone slabs and are still plainly visible. Law code Fragmentary boustrophedon inscription (code of law) in the agora of Gortyna. Inheritance regulations, fragment of the 11th column of the Law Code of Gortyna, Louvre. Among archaeologists, ancient historians, and classicists Gortyn is known today primarily because of the 1884 discovery of the Gortyn Code which is both the oldest and most complete known example of a code of ancient Greek law.Œô.Œë. Typaldos - Interpretation of the Gortyn inscription discovered at 1884 (Athens 1887)Marg. Guarducci, Gortyniarum legum titulus maximus (page 123, 4th book - Inscriptiones creticae) The code was discovered on the site of a structure built by the Roman emperor Trajan, the Odeon, which for the second time, reused stones from an inscription-bearing wall that also had been incorporated into the foundation of an earlier Hellenistic structure. Although portions of the inscriptions have been placed in museums such as the Louvre in Paris, a modern structure at the site of the mostly ruined Odeon now houses many of the stones bearing the famous law code.\\" A copy of the code has been returned to Athens by the Italian Museum in Taranto and is now housed in the Greek Vouli. The curator of the Taranto Museum spoke in Greek and told the famous and political guests that, \\"Greece is not part of Europe, it is Europe.\\" Myth of Europa and Zeus Classical Greek mythology has it that Gortyn was the site of one of Zeus' many affairs. This myth features the princess Europa, whose name has been applied to the continent, Europe. Disguised as a bull, Zeus abducted Europa from Lebanon and they had an affair under a plane tree (platanus),Yves Bonnefoy, Greek and Egyptian Mythologies (1992) University of Chicago Press a tree that may be seen today in Gortys. Following this affair three children were born, Minos, Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon, who became the kings of the three Minoan Palaces in Crete. The identification of Europa in this myth gives weight to the claim that the civilization of the European continent was born on the island of Crete. A colossal statue of Europa sitting on the back of a bull was discovered at the amphitheatre in Gortyna in the nineteenth century and is now in the collections of the British Museum.British Museum Collection Many coins were found with Europa representations on the back, showing that the people honored Europa as a great goddess [20]. The Odyssey According to Book III of Homer's The Odyssey, Menelaus and his fleet of ships, returning home from the Trojan War, were blown off course to the Gortyn coastline. Homer describes stormy seas that pushed the ships against a sharp reef, ultimately destroying many of the vessels but sparing the crew.

Over the course of his forty-one year career, George E. Kessler completed over 200 projects and prepared plans for 26 communities, 26 park and boulevard systems, 49 parks, 46 estates and residences, and 26 schools. His projects can be found in 23 states, 100 cities, in places as far flung as Shanghai, New York, and Mexico City. \\"Planning\\", wrote Kessler, \\"should be comprehensive. Even though a grand urban design could only be realized in bits and pieces, and over a long period of years, still we should always know where we are going. Each bit and piece should be understandable by reference to the great plan of which it is a part. Planning must also be relevant to the particular city: its geography, its economic character, all its local peculiarities. We must,\\" he insisted, \\"deal with it in its application to the entire city. The object is to make cities decent places for masses of people to live in. Cities grow mostly by accident in response to trends in the real estate market. Very little thought is given to their qualitative characters. But there comes a time when development must be subject to control, when further growth must be planned such that urbanization will no longer proceed at the expense of devastating 'nature.'\\" Early life and education George E. Kessler was born in Frankenhausen, Germany, to Edward Carl Kessler and Adolphe Clotilde Zeitsche Kessler on July 16, 1862. In 1865 the family, including George's sister, Fredericka Antionette Louisa, emigrated to the United States. After living briefly in New Jersey, Missouri, and Wisconsin, the family ultimately settled in Dallas, Texas, where George's father and uncle invested in a cotton plantation. His father died in 1878. After his father's death, George, at the age of sixteen, worked as a cashboy at Sanger Brothers Dry Goods. After consultation with relatives, Clotilde decided that landscape architecture would combine the right degree of creativity and practicality to suit her son's temperament. The family moved back to Germany, where George received formal training. He undertook a two- year apprenticeship at the private landscape gardening school at the Grand Ducal Gardens in Weimar, Germany, where he studied botany, forestry, and design under Hofg√§rtner Armin Sckell and Garteninspector Julius Hartwig. He then worked for several months with Haage and Schmidt, a major German plant nursery in Erfurt. He received further training in Charlottenburg and Potsdam that included a brief study at Gaertner Lehr Anstalt, the school of garden design founded by Peter Joseph Lenn√©; technical engineering study at Gartner- Lehranstalt; study with Hofg√§rtner Theodore Neitner at the Neue Garten; and study at the Polytechnicum, the premier horticultural library in Germany. Upon completion of a course in civil engineering at the University of Jena, he toured central and western Europe and southern England for one year with a tutor in order to study civic design in major cities from Paris to Moscow. \\"Of all of it,\\" he later said, \\"the travel was of most value.\\" Career =First job and Merriam Park= In October 1881, the Kessler family returned to New York. From January 1882 through March, Kessler sent four letters to Frederick Law Olmsted. The January 22 letter is the first record of his attempt to begin work in the United States. In the letter Kessler wrote of his studies and travel in Europe and wondered about an arboretum job at Boston's Arnold Arboretum. In the February 15 letter, Kessler wrote that he was \\"certain of a situation in Central Park\\" and of an offer of a partnership with a florist in Woodlawn. \\"Since November\\", Kessler wrote, \\"I have been in the employ of A. LeMoult 172 and 174 Bowery, having charge of his greenhouse, seed and grass stock. Decoration of concert halls were also mostly in my care.\\" Kessler also sent drawings. Olmsted responded in March and urged Kessler \\"to be ambitious to be master in higher fields\\" than pleasure grounds and home gardens. Also Olmsted encouraged Kessler to educate himself about nature through reading, reflection, and excursions, and to aim to free himself from German associations in order to expand his capabilities and to not limit his influence and opportunities. A recommended reading list of book was included. Olmsted concluded by writing that the Kansas City, Fort Scott, and Gulf Railway Company might be in need of a man to take charge of a public picnic or excursion ground. He told Kessler that the President, H.H. Hunniwell, would be in New York, and that Olmsted had given him Kessler's address. On March 18, Kessler provided additional information on his work in the Bowery and wrote that if he stayed with LeMoult, he would receive fifteen dollars a week. The last letter to Olmsted on March 23 stated that Kessler was taking a position with the railroad at Merriam Park in Johnson County, Kansas, for a salary of forty dollars per month. The work was to design and supervise the construction of the railroad's pleasure park. Merriam Park was located ten miles southwest of Kansas City, Missouri. Kessler, along with his mother and sister, moved to a house on John Mastin's Johnson County farm. Besides working on the park, Kessler served as caretaker of the farm property. Although Merriam Park had been dedicated in 1880, when Kessler arrived there was only one building intended for visitors, a square dance floor, and nearly all the valuable trees had been cut down for cordwood. Less than two years after Kessler started the park had become a great success. The park had been enclosed with a fence and the main entrance was an ornamental archway. Features included an open-air shelter for large public gatherings, wild animal exhibits, picnic grounds, a pavilion, a lake, tennis courts, croquet grounds, a horse-drawn merry-go- round, numerous swings, and a baseball diamond. The cost to enter the park was 25 cents and the park attracted more than 20,000 visitors each day. A detailed description of the park before and after Kessler may be found in The Life and Work of George Edward Kessler. Kessler maintained a nursery in the park filled with a large variety of trees and shrubs. He was also responsible for sales from the park's icehouse and arranged excursions to the park. In addition to his work at Merriam Park, Kessler prepared landscape plans and supervised the maintenance of many of the railroad's stations in Kansas and Missouri. He also managed the company's two experimental tree farms () near Farlington, Kansas. =Kansas City= thumbrightThe Paseo at 17th Street, Kansas City, MO, completed 1897.The Library of Congress, American Memory.

In 1887 he was commissioned to bring order to a hollow that formed the center of Kansas City's fashionable Hyde Park neighborhood. Kessler landscaped the hollow and then encircled it with a boulevard to prevent residents from turning it into part of their backyards. The layout spurred sales of stately homes along the boulevard. The success of the project drew the attention of The Kansas City Star publisher, William Rockhill Nelson, who would champion the City Beautiful Movement. On May 31, 1890, Kessler applied to become the landscape architect for the city's newly created Park Board. Following court challenges on whether the city could issue bonds to fund parks, Kansas City finally got the approvals to create a park board on March 5, 1892, thanks to the efforts of August Meyer. Kessler had earlier designed the grounds of Meyer's house in what is today's Kansas City Art Institute. Kansas City's model for park and boulevard systems would be used by numerous cities. Kessler was hired as the board's engineer. Kessler later worked with Meyer to lay out the city's street grid including a parks and boulevard system. The initial 1893 plan called for of boulevards and of parks. The Paseo was named after the famed Paseo de la Reforma, one of Mexico City's most fashionable boulevards. Between 1899 and 1901 he worked on the first plans for Gage Park in Topeka. On May 14, 1900 Kessler married Ida Grant Field of Kansas City, Missouri. They had one son, George Edward Kessler, Jr. =Booming practice= George Kessler's ca. 1901 plan for Overton Park in Memphis, Tennessee.Beginning in 1901 and continuing through 1914 Kessler designed the Memphis Park and Parkway System. His plan for Memphis included two major urban parks and a loop of landscaped roadway connecting them. In 1904, he designed and landscaped the grounds at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. The same year he also designed Fair Park in Dallas, but his biggest contribution to that city was his Kessler Plan, which he created in 1909. That year the Dallas Chamber of Commerce established the City Plan and Improvement League and hired Kessler to design a long-range plan of civic improvements for Dallas. His plans aimed to prevent the uncontrollable flooding of the Trinity River, improve the narrow, crooked downtown streets, fix the dangerous railroad crossings, and construct the Central Expressway. His plans were not implemented at that time, being deemed \\"impractical,\\" but later it became clear that changes were needed. The Central Expressway project was finally realized 40 years after the Kessler Plan was first presented. On the strength of their acclaimed plan for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1905 Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee contracted Kessler and Company to prepare a master plan. However, the Kessler Plan was overly aggressive and suggested removing nearly all the original campus structures. University leadership disagreed and wished to preserve existing buildings so, with the exception of one new building, the plan was not adopted.Campus Land Use / Master Planning History at Vanderbilt. Downloaded 9 Feb 2018. In 1910 Kessler moved to St. Louis, Missouri. In 1912 and 1913 he designed the expansive Longview Farm for Robert A. Long, south of Kansas City. With over , it was community bigger than some small towns, with over 50 buildings. The landscaping earned the farm the title of The World's Most Beautiful Farm. The community had underground electricity, filtered water from a water tower, steam heating, and indoor plumbing, as well as of macadamized roads that was innovative for that era. The landscape layout around the mansion included manicured shrubbery, fountains, and a tennis court. In 1911-1912, he further developed and refined plans for the Fort Wayne Park and Boulevard System originally developed by Charles Mulford Robinson in 1909. Note: This includes and and Accompanying photographs. Kessler was hired to resolve a politically charged development dispute involving the park system of Indianapolis in 1908. He studied the city for a year before submitting his plan for a park and boulevard system, which was adopted in 1909. Kessler led the city's Park Commission until 1915. He issued a master plan for Leeper Park in South Bend, Indiana in 1915. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs In 1918 Kessler returned to act as consulting engineer for the Dallas Property Owner's Association, and in 1919 began working for the Metropolitan Development Association of the Dallas Chamber of Commerce. On January 3, 1922, he returned to St. Louis. His plans for the Trinity River were finally implemented in the 1930s. Kessler also drafted city plans for Cincinnati, Ohio; Terre Haute, Indiana; Cleveland, Ohio; El Paso, Texas; Denver, Colorado; and Syracuse, New York. He also designed Camp Wilson, an army cantonment near San Antonio, Texas. =Death and memorials= In 1920, George Kessler was again hired by Indianapolis. He was supervising the construction of a new major east/west belt road on March 20, 1923, when he died. He was survived by his wife and son and was buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. The Indianapolis road he was supervising was named Kessler Boulevard in his honor. In Dallas, the Kessler Park neighborhood is named for him. Longview, Washington named Kessler Boulevard and Kessler Elementary School in his honor. Kessler was a founder of the American Institute of Planners. He was also one of the original members of the United States Commission of Fine Arts. George Edward Kessler was a Freemason in Rural Lodge No. 316, Kansas City, Missouri. He became a 32¬∞ Scottish Rite Mason in Western Missouri Consistory of the Valley of Kansas City in 1903.

Kaplan delayed his entrance to Harvard University because he believed he could create a mathematics model that would assist him in being successful at blackjack. In 1977, Kaplan turned $1000 into $35000 within a nine-month period. Summary Mathematics Professor, Doug Barnes, play the game of blackjack at casinos using a tactic known as card counting to move the odds in his favour. Wilson, a casino security manager, captures Barnes' face, and effectively blacklists him from the casino. Barnes' usurer, Orr, meets with Barnes to discuss how he will get his money back after Barnes is banned from the casino. Barnes suggests the idea of creating a team of card counters from the students at the university where Barnes teaches. Orr snips off one of Barnes' fingertips explaining that this will assist Barnes in remembering him, and tells him that he will consider his team proposal.Gill, Pierre. (2016) \\"The Last Casino (Master)\\", Retrieved on April 2, 2018. After searching around the university, Barnes recruits three students: George, who has memorized pi 70 units past the decimal; Scott, who aces a complex memorization test; and Elyse, a waitress who successfully memorizes a complicated order Barnes makes for a pizza in a short period of time. After convincing them that his plan has little risk, Barnes proceeds to teach the students to count cards. Barnes brings the students to Orr, and tells them that he is their investor. Orr agrees to give money and tells Barnes that they are partners and he will get 75% of Barnes' 50% share. Prior to the group going to their first casino, Barnes gives them different identities. At the first casino, George becomes overwhelmed by the game and Elyse jumps in to help. After their first night, they make $6,000. The film goes into a montage of the students at the casino and outside of the casino, earning and spending their money on luxurious items. One night at the casino, Elyse is approached by a man who claims he chases gamblers. Elyse asks him if he noticed any pros at the casino that night and he points out Scott, saying that it is obvious that he is a card counter. After an off night at the casino, Orr tells Barnes that the deal is off because the kids are struggling and Barnes' gambling is out of hand. He gives Barnes one week to pay back his $100,000 debt. Barnes meets with the students and tells them that they have one week to earn $500,000. Barnes tells them that Orr is not a man they want to mess with; and the students start to make a plan to play at all the casinos in the Ottawa and Quebec area. The casino discovers their team and attempts to get them all in a room to talk. The casino questions Scott and George. The students then move onto the Ottawa region, hoping that the casinos have not heard about them. After their night in Ottawa, Elyse discovers that Scott lost $20,000. George goes back to the casino in attempt to make the team money. After hours at the casino, George was taken by the casino management where he gets in a fight because he did not want to give up the money he made. The team buys their way into a secret game, where they discover that their card counting will not work. The team bets big and in the beginning loses their money. After a big win, Elyse suggest they take a break. Elyse tells the secret casino manager that the deck is short four cards and asks for them to be counted. The team packs up and decides to bring the money they have to Barnes. When they hand over the money to Barnes, they arranged for Orr to meet as well, to ensure Barnes does not steal the money. The movie concludes with them finding out that Barnes lied about the amount owed. George gives Elyse money to help her with school and they part ways.

He made his first appearance on-screen on 14 January 2001. Adam was played by Iain De Caestecker from the character's first appearance in 2001 until 21 July 2003 with Robertson taking over the role from 31 December 2004 until 20 April 2007. Robertson reprised the role in 2016 and made his return on screen on 16 November 2016. Adam is the son of Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) and Susan Barlow (Joanna Foster), and the grandson of Ken Barlow (William Roache). Storylines =2001‚Äì2007= Adam first appears aged 12 when he is visiting his uncle Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), grandfather Ken Barlow (William Roache) and Ken's partner Deirdre Rachid (Anne Kirkbride), with his mother, Susan Barlow (Joanna Foster). It is revealed that Ken's arch-enemy and Susan's former husband, Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), is Adam's father. Adam was injured in a car crash that killed Susan. Adam goes to live with Mike but leaves to go to boarding school in Scotland, but returns after doing his Highers exams. Adam purchases a car from an auction, but in an embarrassing turn of events, after filling his car up with petrol on a day out with his girlfriend Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson), his car ignites by the roadside. The cause of the fire is a mystery until a policewoman informs him that his car functions on diesel, not petrol. He works at his father's factory, Underworld, and irritates his older half-brother, Danny Baldwin (Bradley Walsh), by being the apple of his father's eye. He is dumped by ambitious Candice via letter, has a short fling with Kelly Crabtree (Tupele Dorgu), and has a crush on Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien) when he first returns to Weatherfield. Adam begins dating shy factory worker Joanne Jackson (Zaraah Abrahams) after they flirt at his birthday party. Adam was devastated when Mike died of a heart attack. Adam was determined to bring Danny down after he steals his inheritance, unaware that Mike's will is invalid because a more recent will left everything to him. Only Danny and Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) are aware that it existed and Danny is determined to ensure that Adam does not get his inheritance. However, following her split from Danny, Leanne gives a copy of the new will to Adam and he could have claimed his inheritance and press criminal charges against Danny. After Danny is questioned by the police, he offers Adam a 40% share of the factory and acting on Ken's advice, he accepts. In September 2006, Adam sells his 40% to Liam Connor (Rob James- Collier). Liam's older brother, Paul (Sean Gallagher), purchases the remaining 60% in January 2007. Joanne later dumps Adam by text message, after not seeing him for months. Adam leaves Weatherfield in April and moves to Portsmouth with his uncle, Peter, where they open a bookies together. =2016‚Äì= In November 2016, on his return to Weatherfield, Adam is caught in Underworld by current owner, Johnny Connor (Richard Hawley) and his son, Aidan Connor (Shayne Ward). He, Peter and his aunt, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), visit Ken in hospital following a stroke. They meet Ken's son, Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard). Adam joins his family for a meal and defends Tracy against her ex-husband, Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill). Adam gets revenge on Robert by calling environmental health. Daniel is suspected of stealing Adam's car when Tracy and Adam visit his flat and find student debts and become suspicious when his mother, Denise Osbourne (Denise Black) is nowhere to be found. Adam later has sex with Maria Connor (Samia Longchambon), causing a fight between him and Aidan in The Rovers. Adam continues his feud with Aidan while forming a friendly rivalry with Daniel and Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley). In February 2017, Adam has sex with Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan) and they begin a relationship. Adam finds out that Rosie and her sister, Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent), buried cocaine in Brian Packham's (Peter Gunn) allotment. When Ken is pushed down the stairs by an unknown assailant (see Who Attacked Ken?), Adam becomes prime suspect as he and Ken argued about Ken's will. Adam uses the drugs to blackmail Rosie into giving him a false alibi but is arrested when Rosie's alibi is proved false. As there is insufficient evidence to charge Adam, he is released. Adam becomes suspicious of Daniel but Tracy believes Adam was responsible and tries to set him up but he finds out and reveals that he is suspicious of Tracy. Tracy's daughter, Amy Barlow (Elle Mulvaney), believes Adam is responsible and calls the police with evidence to prove that Adam is responsible. Adam is released again but his intentions turn to Daniel and his girlfriend, Sinead Tinker (Katie McGlynn). When Tracy and Amy disappear, Adam uses this to his advantage and frames her. Tracy confesses, trying to protect Amy as she believes that Amy could be responsible. Adam suspects Daniel after Tracy is cleared and kidnaps him, taking him to an isolated area and intends to make him confess but fails and Daniel escapes. Adam is arrested again and charged with Ken's attack, Daniel is revealed as Ken's real attacker as he hit him over the head with a poetry book, making him fall down the stairs. Adam later discovers that Aidan is having an affair with Maria when he sees them kissing. Adam takes a photo of them and uses it to blackmail Aidan. He plans to expose the affair to Aidan's fianc√©e, Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley), but Eva reveals that she is aware of his affair with Maria and begs Adam to stop blackmailing Aidan, before revealing that she has faked her pregnancy so that Aidan will not go to Maria. Adam agrees, but Eva reveals that she is out for revenge and needs Adam's help. Adam agrees and they plan revenge. However, as Eva is about to marry Aidan, she changes her mind at the last minute about the plan to clear the factory and the bank accounts, unaware that Adam has proceeded with the plan. When the Connors discover Eva's deceit, they report her to the police. Eva angrily vows to Adam that she intends to drag him to prison with her. Creation Adam's existence is that of a retcon. Although off-screen, Susan didn't fake an abortion so she could leave Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), she \\"aborted\\" her child as she wasn't prepared for motherhood. Also 2001 seems to hint that Ken never had contact with Susan after 1987 so wasn't aware of Adam, however this is untrue as he still visited Susan off-screen in that time. Susan was said to be present at Peter's wedding in 1990. Adam was introduced in January 2001, played by Iain De Caestecker, as part of a storyline which involved a custody battle between long-time rivals Ken Barlow (William Roache) and Mike, the character of Adam departed at the conclusion of the storyline, however De Caestecker reprised the role for two separate stints in 2002 and 2003. On 13 December 2004, it was reported by Digital Spy that the role of Adam had been recast with Sam Robertson taking over the role from 31 December 2004. Development In July 2016, it was announced that Coronation Street would be extending the Barlow family by reintroducing Adam along with Peter Barlow and Daniel Osbourne. It was announced that Chris Gascoyne had reprised his role as Peter and Rob Mallard had taken over the role as Daniel, followed by Robertson reprising his role as Adam. Addressing the plans, producer Kate Oates told Digital Spy: \\"One of the things I am most excited about and something I consider a real privilege is that I am lucky enough to work on the longest-running soap. One of the longest-running families on that soap is the Barlows and why would you not want to strengthen that family? I love the idea of Ken as the head of the family which has Tracy, Simon and Amy. I am excited to bring Peter back to the show. I am delighted to meet Daniel Osborne, who is Ken‚Äôs child with Denise and I am excited to bring back Adam, who is Mike Baldwin‚Äôs son and Ken‚Äôs grandson. I think that strong family dynasty - the first family on the soap, as it were - here, big, strong and sending ripples through the street, is really exciting and I am really looking forward to seeing that.‚Äù Of his return, Robertson said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm delighted to be back. Coronation Street was my first job as an actor and is a special place for me. As a young actor it was a little overwhelming, so I‚Äôm looking forward to coming back and stamping my mark on the character - I feel there‚Äôs unfinished business with Adam\\". In an interview with the Radio Times, asked if Adam would become a womaniser like his father Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), Robertson replied: \\"Oh yes, it‚Äôs in my contract! Absolutely Adam‚Äôs a womaniser and at the minute he doesn‚Äôt seem to have much regard for the women he‚Äôs with. He doesn‚Äôt seem to have much heart, but maybe this is leading to him getting his fingers burnt. In 2017, a \\"whodunnit\\" storyline involving the character of Ken Barlow began; the storyline saw an unknown person push Ken down the stairs in the Barlow household, with Adam being named as one of the suspects alongside Daniel, Peter, Tracy, Amy, Pat Phelan and Sinead Tinker. ITV released a poll to the Coronation Street website so that fans could share their thoughts as to who pushed Ken. Fans and viewers used the poll, with the majority's thoughts of the attacker being Adam. Robertson later admitted that he thinks Adam pushed Ken.  Reception  In August 2017, Robertson was longlisted for Sexiest Male at the Inside Soap Awards. He made the viewer-voted shortlist, but lost out to Davood Ghadami, who portrays Kush Kazemi in EastEnders.

She was married to Raja Ramkanta Ray, 'Zamindar' of Natore estate. Rajshahi Raj or Natore estate was a large zamindari which occupied a vast position of Bengal. The Natore estate had an area of nearly and included not only much of North Bengal but also large parts of the areas later comprising the administrative districts of Murshidabad, Nadia, Jessore, Birbhum and Burdwan. After the death of her husband, Rani Bhabani of Natore Rajbari, expanded both the estate and the palace. Biography Born in Chhatimgram village, Bogra District, Her father's name was Atmaram Choudhury. Bhabani was married off to Raja Ramkanta Roy, the then zamindar of Rajshahi. After his death, Bhabani became the de jure zamindar, and started being referred to as Rani, or queen. A woman as a zamindar was extremely rare in those days, but Rani Bhabani managed the vast Rajshahi zamindari most efficiently and effectively for over four decades. John Holwell, an English writer, speculated that the stipulated annual rent of the estate to the crown was 7 million rupees, the real revenues being about 15 million. However, what made Rani Bhabani a household name among the common people was her philanthropy and general generosity, combined with an austere personal life. The number of temples, guesthouses and roads she constructed across Bengal is believed to be in the hundreds. She also built numerous water tanks, alleviating the acute water problem of her subjects. She was also interested in the spread of education and donated generously to many educational institutes. During the era of Rani Bhabani, she made some great contributions for the development and renovation of Bhabanipur temple. Bhabanipur is a shakti-peeth which is located at Sherpur Upazila of Bogra District. Rani Bhabani's house in Natore remains a main tourist attraction in Bangladesh to date.

Early life He was born in Linz. His origin and his unusual name (literally \\"do good\\") have been the subject of some legends. One such legend was that the original form of his name was Thunichtgut, or Thenitguet (\\"do no good\\"), but that the name was altered to Thugut by Empress Maria Theresa. In reality, Thugut was the name of his great-grandfather, who came from Budweis in southern Bohemia. He was the legitimate son of Johann Thugut, an army paymaster, who married Eva Maria M√∂sbauer, daughter of a miller near Vienna. The paymaster, who died about 1760, left his widow and children in distress, and Maria Theresa took charge of them. Constantinople Johann Amadeus was sent to the school of Oriental languages. He entered the Austrian foreign office as an interpreter and was appointed dragoman to the embassy at Constantinople. In 1769 he was appointed charg√© d'affaires, and in that capacity secured a grant of money and a promise of the territory of Little Wallachia from the Turks during the negotiations connected with the First Partition of Poland. In 1771 he was appointed internuncio at Constantinople and was actively engaged, under the direction of Prince Kaunitz, in all the diplomacy of Austria in Turkey and Poland until he secured the cession of the Bukovina on 7 May 1775. During these years Thugut was engaged in a mean intrigue. His salary as dragoman was small, and his needs great. He therefore agreed to receive a pension of 13,000 livres, a brevet of lieutenant-colonel, and a promise of a safe refuge in case of necessity from the king of France, Louis XV. The condition on which the pension was granted was that he took advantage of his position as an Austrian official to render secret services to France. The only excuses to be made for him are that such hidden arrangements were not uncommon before and in his time, and that as a matter of fact he never did render France any real service, or betray his masters at Vienna. Yet the terror of discovery disturbed him at several periods of his life, and when Louis XV died in 1774 he showed a strong disposition to take refuge in France, and would have done so if Louis XVI would have given him a promise of employment. His pension was continued. It seems to be tolerably certain that at a later period he made a clean breast to the Emperor Francis II. His services at Constantinople were approved by Prince Kaunitz, who may possibly have been informed of the arrangement with the French secret diplomatic fund. It is never safe to decide whether these treasons were single or double. When Thugut was appointed internuncio he was also ennobled, being raised to the Ritterstand. After 1775 he travelled in France and Italy, partly on diplomatic service. Pre- Revolutionary period In 1778 he was the agent through whom Maria Theresa entered into direct negotiations with Frederick the Great, in order to stop the Bavarian War. In 1780 he was Austrian envoy in Warsaw, but in 1783 he applied for leave and satisfied his hankering after France by living for four years in Paris. It was in this time that his savings, made during his years of service at Constantinople, by means which would probably not bear investigation, were invested in France. Thugut became acquainted with many of the leaders in the French Revolution. From 1787 to 1789 he was minister at Naples, and showed great tact in managing the queen, Maria Carolina, a daughter of Maria Theresa. In 1790 he was sent by the Emperor Joseph II to Bucharest, nominally as commissioner with the hospodar of Wallachia, but in reality in order that he might open negotiations for peace with the Turks. Revolutionary wars Until 1792 he was much in France and Belgium, partly as a diplomatic agent, but largely because he was anxious to rescue his investments, which were ultimately lost. His personal grievances may have had some share in creating the hatred of the Revolution and the Jacobins, for which he was afterwards famous. In 1792 he was associated with Mercy- Argenteau, formerly Austrian ambassador in France, as diplomatic agent at the headquarters of the allied army. The mismanagement of the invasion of France excited his anger. He came back to Vienna to report the facts to Francis II, to whom he presented a statement on 27 December. On 19 January 1793 he was appointed arm√©e-diplomat at headquarters, largely, it is said, by the intrigues of Philip Cobenzl and Spielmann, who wished to have him out of the way. But he never went, for at this time Russia and Prussia annexed large parts of Poland. Austria, entangled in the war with France, was left empty- handed. The emperor, dissatisfied with the ministers who had not prevented this misfortune, dismissed them, and after some delay Thugut was named \\"director of the foreign affairs of Austria\\" on 25 March 1793. When Prince Kaunitz died in the following year Thugut was appointed to \\"discharge the duties of the office of house, court, and state chancellor.\\" His promotion to the foremost place in the Austrian administration met with much opposition, and is known to have been largely due to the empress Maria Theresa of Naples. The Austrian government was by tradition very aristocratic. The empress Maria Theresa, mother of Francis II, though she valued the services of Thugut, had consented with reluctance to make him Commander of the Order of St Stephen, and had only yielded to the urgent requests of Kaunitz and of her son Joseph II. She thought the promotion excessive for a man of his plebeian origin. The nobles, who thought that the great offices of state should go to themselves, were of the same opinion. Thugut, who had a large fund of vanity, resented their insolence, and did nothing to disarm their hostility. He was unmarried, and he avoided all society. In the discharge of his duties he took counsel with nobody. All the confidential work of his department was done by himself with the help of two clerks he could trust, and he took all important papers directly to the emperor, keeping no copies in his own office. He had his own experience to teach him how easy it was to bribe the officials of Austria. The nobles, who regarded themselves with good cause as the supporters of the Crown, and who expected to be consulted, resented his indifference and secrecy as the arrogance of an upstart. They were his constant enemies and critics. A few of them who admired his abilities supported him on personal grounds, but with these exceptions Thugut had no friends in Austria. Out of it, he was commonly regarded as the representative of all that was most unscrupulous and self-seeking in the methods of the Austrian government. He had inherited from his master Prince Kaunitz the firm conviction that Prussia was the worst enemy of Austria. From him, too, he had learnt that the first duty of an Austrian minister was to be an increaser of the empire, even at the expense of allies, and that excuses for annexation were to be made when they could not be found. His hatred of France, and of the Revolution, was no doubt sincere. But while prepared to defend Europe from French aggression, it was with the implied intention that Austria should be rewarded for her exertions by increases of territory, and should be made the absolute mistress of Germany. The history of his policy from 1793 to 1800 touches much of the history of Europe. The conflicting objects which he kept before him, resistance to French aggression on the west, and to Russian and Prussian aggressions on the east, and the pursuit of more territory for Austria, compelled him to divide his exertions and his forces. Thus in 1793‚Äì94 he recalled troops from the west to participate in a partition of Poland, thereby taking pressure off France, and doing much to smooth the way for her subsequent victories. Some of his actions cannot be described as other than criminal. He was certainly responsible for the murderous attack on the French envoys at Rastadt in April 1799. He may have intended that they should only be robbed, but he must be held responsible for the acts of his agents. So again he has to answer for the perverse policy of Austria in 1799 when Suvarov and the Russians were recalled from northern Italy for no visible reason except that Austria should be left in sole possession of the dominions of the king of Sardinia, with a good excuse for keeping them. The correspondence of Joseph de Maistre shows how bitterly the continental allies of Austria resented her selfishness, and how firmly they were persuaded that she was fighting for her own hand. That Thugut believed that he was doing his duty, and that he was carrying on the traditional policy of Austria, may be true. Yet his methods were so extreme, and his attitude so provocative as to justify the judgment passed on him by Kaunitz namely, that he required the control of a strong hand if good results were to be obtained from his ability. After the defeats of Austria in Italy in 1796‚Äì97 and the peace of Campo Formio, it became a fixed object with the French, and with a growing party in Austria who held him responsible for the disasters of the war, to secure the removal of Thugut. He found no support, except from the British government, which considered him, as a sure ally and had great influence at Vienna as paymaster of subsidies. The death of the empress Catherine of Russia deprived him of a friend at court. See also *List of Austrian ambassadors to Turkey End of career During the campaigns of 1799 and 1800 Thugut was the advocate of war \\"to the knife\\". At the end he was kept in office only by the vigorous support of England. The battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800 made his position untenable. He retired from public life, and left Vienna for Pressburg on 27 March 1801. At a later period he returned to Vienna and lived quietly on a pension of 7000 florins until his death on 28 May 1818.

It was often spread throughout coteries, published while trying to remain true to the writer's vision without criticism. Amatory fiction predates, and in some ways predicts, the invention of the novel and is an early predecessor of the romance novel. Indeed, many themes of the contemporary romance novel were first explored in amatory fiction. The writing of amatory fiction work was dominated by women, and it was considered to have mainly female readers; but it is assumed that men read these novels as well. As its name implies, amatory fiction is preoccupied with sexual love and romance. Most of its works were short stories. The three most prominent amatory fiction writers were: Eliza Haywood (who wrote Love in Excess; Or, The Fatal Enquiry and Fantomina: Or, Love in a Maze, as well as over 70 other published works); Delarivier Manley, (author of The Lost Lover (play) and Almyna: or, The Arabian Vow. A Tragedy) and Aphra Behn (who wrote The History of the Nun and \\"To the Fair Clarinda, Who Made Love to Me, Imagined More than Woman\\", and one of her most popular works \\"The Disappointment\\", which is a tale about a sexual encounter, written from a females point of view, could possibly be about male impotence). Together, these writers were known as \\"the fair triumvirate of wit\\", a phrase coined by Rev. James Sterling, though their reputation for scandalous writing caused some to call them the \\"naughty triumvirate.\\"Toni O'Shaughnessy Bowers, \\"Sex, Lies, and Invisibility: Amatory Fiction from the Restoration to Mid-Century,\\" The Columbia History of the British Novel, Ed. John Richetti, Columbia UP, 1994, 51.''''  Themes of amatory fiction Narrowly defined, amatory fiction challenges formulaic genre which typically depicts an innocent, trusting woman being deceived by a self-serving, lustful man, by reversing the gender specific roles. For example, in Fantomina, by Eliza Haywood, the nameless protagonist is a noble born woman who changes her appearance to seduce the male Beauplaisir numerous times. For the women of amatory fiction, love typically ends in misery. = A form of feminism = Authors of amatory fiction had a tendency to use their novellas as a commentary on women's roles in society, and how they were being treated. There are many instances where the use of sarcasm highlights the sentiment the author was trying to get across to the audience. Another popular, and similar, writing tactic was called swerve, which involved the author being sarcastic about how they were viewed to be inferior, as to not upset the male critics. These writers often detailed extramarital affairs, and promoted strong themes of scandal, and sexual promiscuity. While an observer would immediately identify a focus on sentimental love and the erotic, there is an underlying motivation to present the woman in an entirely different light. Instead of sentimentality and the abundance of romantic elements, there is an identifiable desire to depict women who want fulfillment of their own sexual desire as opposed to merely serving the pleasure of men. For example, a writer of amatory fiction would create a female character who demands more from friendship and pursues personal satisfaction in her relationships. For a time, this was branded as sentimentality and romantic thinking. However, later years would recognize this as a way in which women started to break away from the oppressive tactics of male domination. There are those who also link amatory fiction to the concept of the female Bildungsroman, which promoted a female character's development \\"especially its interest in portraying a form of female power that is viable even in a society where women were allowed only limited control over their own lives.\\" Although amatory fiction was originally excluded from \\"rise of the novel\\" narratives, traditionally written by men, contemporary scholars conclude that these works are not merely precursors to the novel, but novels in their own right. These amatory works were some of the only places women could speak for themselves, express their feelings of oppression, and share their experiences. Some works of amatory fiction were considered immoral by contemporary standards, and allowed their characters to commit scandalous love affairs without being \\"punished\\" based on themes of Christian, social, legal or other forms of poetic justice.

The source of the river is near Corno di Campo in the Province of Sondrio in Italy. It flows northeast past Livigno and into Lago di Livigno. It exits the lake at the Italian/Swiss border and flows northwest through Parc Naziunal Svizzer before emptying into the Inn near Zernez. Despite rising in Italy, the river is a tributary of the Inn, and the Danube, rather than of the Po. In other words, its valley is on the northern side of the Alpine watershed. In this area geographical and political boundaries do not coincide. Due to an international treaty, an artificial lake, Lago di Livigno, was created by Engadiner Kraftwerke in the 1960s, with a dam on the border. Despite indemnisation, not all inhabitants were willing to leave this part of the valley. The reservoir has a capacity of . Its minimum and maximum water levels above sea level are at and respectively. Since its construction, this lake had been off-limits for any activity, such as wind-surfing or rowing, until the summer of 2005, when Italy's National Rowing team was authorized to train on the lake. The same international treaty allowed another electricity company to catch the waters of Aqua Granda and other tributaries above a certain elevation and to transport it through a tunnel to the artificial lakes of Cancano, in Val Fraele, on the other side of the watershed. This has decreased the water level on the river dramatically, with some parts of it left without water, causing strong but ineffective protests by the local population. Nowadays this river is popular for fishing, virtually the only other use which can be made of it.

Huntington was killed when his plane was shot down. However, Gay survived, becoming the sole member of the squadron to live through the battle. Namesake The USS Robert K. Huntington (DD-781), an Allen M. Sumner-class destroyer, was named in his honor. Robert K. Huntington attended The Lakeside School in Seattle Washington in 1940 after transferring from Pasadena College. Lakeside is the same prep school attended by Bill Gates ('73) and Paul Allen ('71).

It is a matrix method that makes use of the members' stiffness relations for computing member forces and displacements in structures. The direct stiffness method is the most common implementation of the finite element method (FEM). In applying the method, the system must be modeled as a set of simpler, idealized elements interconnected at the nodes. The material stiffness properties of these elements are then, through matrix mathematics, compiled into a single matrix equation which governs the behaviour of the entire idealized structure. The structure‚Äôs unknown displacements and forces can then be determined by solving this equation. The direct stiffness method forms the basis for most commercial and free source finite element software. The direct stiffness method originated in the field of aerospace. Researchers looked at various approaches for analysis of complex airplane frames. These included elasticity theory, energy principles in structural mechanics, flexibility method and matrix stiffness method. It was through analysis of these methods that the direct stiffness method emerged as an efficient method ideally suited for computer implementation. History Between 1934 and 1938 A. R. Collar and W. J. Duncan published the first papers with the representation and terminology for matrix systems that are used today. Aeroelastic research continued through World War II but publication restrictions from 1938 to 1947 make this work difficult to trace. The second major breakthrough in matrix structural analysis occurred through 1954 and 1955 when professor John H. Argyris systemized the concept of assembling elemental components of a structure into a system of equations. Finally, on Nov. 6 1959, M. J. Turner, head of Boeing‚Äôs Structural Dynamics Unit, published a paper outlining the direct stiffness method as an efficient model for computer implementation . Member stiffness relations A typical member stiffness relation has the following general form: :mathbf{Q}^m = mathbf{k}^m mathbf{q}^m + mathbf{Q}^{om} qquad qquad qquad mathrm{(1)} where :m = member number m. :mathbf{Q}^m = vector of member's characteristic forces, which are unknown internal forces. :mathbf{k}^m = member stiffness matrix which characterizes the member's resistance against deformations. :mathbf{q}^m = vector of member's characteristic displacements or deformations. :mathbf{Q}^{om} = vector of member's characteristic forces caused by external effects (such as known forces and temperature changes) applied to the member while mathbf{q}^m = 0 . If mathbf{q}^m are member deformations rather than absolute displacements, then mathbf{Q}^m are independent member forces, and in such case (1) can be inverted to yield the so-called member flexibility matrix, which is used in the flexibility method. System stiffness relation For a system with many members interconnected at points called nodes, the members' stiffness relations such as Eq.(1) can be integrated by making use of the following observations: * The member deformations mathbf{q}^m can be expressed in terms of system nodal displacements r in order to ensure compatibility between members. This implies that r will be the primary unknowns. * The member forces mathbf{Q}^m help to the keep the nodes in equilibrium under the nodal forces R. This implies that the right-hand-side of (1) will be integrated into the right-hand-side of the following nodal equilibrium equations for the entire system: :mathbf{R} = mathbf{Kr} + mathbf{R}^o qquad qquad qquad mathrm{(2)} where :mathbf{R} = vector of nodal forces, representing external forces applied to the system's nodes. :mathbf{K} = system stiffness matrix, which is established by assembling the members' stiffness matrices mathbf{k}^m . :mathbf{r} = vector of system's nodal displacements that can define all possible deformed configurations of the system subject to arbitrary nodal forces R. :mathbf{R}^o = vector of equivalent nodal forces, representing all external effects other than the nodal forces which are already included in the preceding nodal force vector R. This vector is established by assembling the members' mathbf{Q}^{om} . Solution The system stiffness matrix K is square since the vectors R and r have the same size. In addition, it is symmetric because mathbf{k}^m is symmetric. Once the supports' constraints are accounted for in (2), the nodal displacements are found by solving the system of linear equations (2), symbolically: :mathbf{r} = mathbf{K}^{-1} (mathbf{R}-mathbf{R}^o ) qquad qquad qquad mathrm{(3)} Subsequently, the members' characteristic forces may be found from Eq.(1) where mathbf{q}^m can be found from r by compatibility consideration. The direct stiffness method It is common to have Eq.(1) in a form where mathbf{q}^m and mathbf{Q}^{om} are, respectively, the member-end displacements and forces matching in direction with r and R. In such case, mathbf{K} and mathbf{R}^o can be obtained by direct summation of the members' matrices mathbf{k}^m and mathbf{Q}^{om} . The method is then known as the direct stiffness method. The advantages and disadvantages of the matrix stiffness method are compared and discussed in the flexibility method article. Example =Breakdown= The first step when using the direct stiffness method is to identify the individual elements which make up the structure. Image:DSMImage1.png Once the elements are identified, the structure is disconnected at the nodes, the points which connect the different elements together. Image:DSMImage2.png Each element is then analyzed individually to develop member stiffness equations. The forces and displacements are related through the element stiffness matrix which depends on the geometry and properties of the element. A truss element can only transmit forces in compression or tension. This means that in two dimensions, each node has two degrees of freedom (DOF): horizontal and vertical displacement. The resulting equation contains a four by four stiffness matrix. begin{bmatrix} f_{x1}  f_{y1}  f_{x2}  f_{y2}  end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} k_{11} & k_{12} & k_{13} & k_{14}  k_{21} & k_{22} & k_{23} & k_{24}  k_{31} & k_{32} & k_{33} & k_{34}  k_{41} & k_{42} & k_{43} & k_{44}  end{bmatrix} begin{bmatrix} u_{x1}  u_{y1}  u_{x2}  u_{y2}  end{bmatrix} A frame element is able to withstand bending moments in addition to compression and tension. This results in three degrees of freedom: horizontal displacement, vertical displacement and in- plane rotation. The stiffness matrix in this case is six by six. begin{bmatrix} f_{x1}  f_{y1}  m_{z1}  f_{x2}  f_{y2}  m_{z2}  end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} k_{11} & k_{12} & k_{13} & k_{14} & k_{15} & k_{16}  k_{21} & k_{22} & k_{23} & k_{24} & k_{25} & k_{26}  k_{31} & k_{32} & k_{33} & k_{34} & k_{35} & k_{36}  k_{41} & k_{42} & k_{43} & k_{44} & k_{45} & k_{46}  k_{51} & k_{52} & k_{53} & k_{54} & k_{55} & k_{56}  k_{61} & k_{62} & k_{63} & k_{64} & k_{65} & k_{66}  end{bmatrix} begin{bmatrix} u_{x1}  u_{y1}  theta_{z1}  u_{x2}  u_{y2}  theta_{z2}  end{bmatrix} Other elements such as plates and shells can also be incorporated into the direct stiffness method and similar equations must be developed. =Assembly= Once the individual element stiffness relations have been developed they must be assembled into the original structure. The first step in this process is to convert the stiffness relations for the individual elements into a global system for the entire structure. In the case of a truss element, the global form of the stiffness method depends on the angle of the element with respect to the global coordinate system (This system is usually the traditional Cartesian coordinate system). begin{bmatrix} f_{x1}  f_{y1}  f_{x2}  f_{y2}  end{bmatrix} = frac{EA}{L} begin{bmatrix} c^2 & sc & -c^2 & -sc  sc & s^2 & -sc & -s^2  -c^2 & -sc & c^2 & sc  -sc & -s^2 & sc & s^2  end{bmatrix} begin{bmatrix} u_{x1}  u_{y1}  u_{x2}  u_{y2}  end{bmatrix} begin{array}{ r } s = sinbeta  c = cosbeta  end{array} (for a truss element at angle Œ≤) Equivalently, left[ begin{array}{c} f_{x1}  f_{y1}  hline f_{x2}  f_{y2}  end{array} right] =frac{EA}{L} left[ begin{array}{c cc c} c_x c_x & c_x c_y & -c_x c_x & -c_x c_y c_y c_x & c_y c_y & -c_y c_x & -c_y c_y hline -c_x c_x & -c_x c_y & c_x c_x & c_x c_y  -c_y c_x & -c_y c_y & c_y c_x & c_y c_y end{array} right] left[ begin{array}{c} u_{x1}  u_{y1}  hline u_{x2}  u_{y2}  end{array} right] where c_x and c_y are the direction cosines of the truss element (i.e., they are components of a unit vector aligned with the member). This form reveals how to generalize the element stiffness to 3-D space trusses by simply extending the pattern that is evident in this formulation. After developing the element stiffness matrix in the global coordinate system, they must be merged into a single ‚Äúmaster‚Äù or ‚Äúglobal‚Äù stiffness matrix. When merging these matrices together there are two rules that must be followed: compatibility of displacements and force equilibrium at each node. These rules are upheld by relating the element nodal displacements to the global nodal displacements. Image:DSMImage3.png The global displacement and force vectors each contain one entry for each degree of freedom in the structure. The element stiffness matrices are merged by augmenting or expanding each matrix in conformation to the global displacement and load vectors. k^{(1)} = frac{EA}{L} begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 & 0  0 & 0 & 0 & 0  -1 & 0 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 0 & 0  end{bmatrix} rightarrow K^{(1)} = frac{EA}{L} begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  end{bmatrix} (for element (1) of the above structure) Finally, the global stiffness matrix is constructed by adding the individual expanded element matrices together. =Solution= Once the global stiffness matrix, displacement vector, and force vector have been constructed, the system can be expressed as a single matrix equation. Image:DSMImage4.png For each degree of freedom in the structure, either the displacement or the force is known. Image:DSMImage5.png After inserting the known value for each degree of freedom, the master stiffness equation is complete and ready to be evaluated. There are several different methods available for evaluating a matrix equation including but not limited to Cholesky decomposition and the brute force evaluation of systems of equations. If a structure isn‚Äôt properly restrained, the application of a force will cause it to move rigidly and additional support conditions must be added. The method described in this section is meant as an overview of the direct stiffness method. Additional sources should be consulted for more details on the process as well as the assumptions about material properties inherent in the process. Applications The direct stiffness method was developed specifically to effectively and easily implement into computer software to evaluate complicated structures that contain a large number of elements. Today, nearly every finite element solver available is based on the direct stiffness method. While each program utilizes the same process, many have been streamlined to reduce computation time and reduce the required memory. In order to achieve this, shortcuts have been developed. One of the largest areas to utilize the direct stiffness method is the field of structural analysis where this method has been incorporated into modeling software. The software allows users to model a structure and, after the user defines the material properties of the elements, the program automatically generates element and global stiffness relationships. When various loading conditions are applied the software evaluates the structure and generates the deflections for the user.

Grandville's illustration from the 1855 edition of La Fontaine's fables The Monkey and the Cat is best known as a fable adapted by Jean de La Fontaine under the title Le Singe et le Chat that appeared in the second collection of his Fables in 1679 (IX.17). Although there is no evidence that the story existed before the 15th century, it began to appear in collections of Aesop's Fables from the 17th centuryNotably in Isaac de Benserade's Fables d'Esope (1678) but is not included in the Perry Index. There are popular idioms derived from it in both English and French with the general meaning of being the dupe of another (e.g., a cat's-paw). Usage of these and reference to the fable have been particularly employed in (although not limited to) political contexts. The fable and its history In La Fontaine's telling, Bertrand the monkey persuades Raton the cat to pull chestnuts from the embers amongst which they are roasting, promising him a share. As the cat scoops them from the fire one by one, burning his paw in the process, the monkey gobbles them up. They are disturbed by a maid entering and the cat gets nothing for its pains. It is from this fable that the French get their idiom Tirer les marrons du feu, meaning to act as someone's dupe or, deriving from that, to benefit from the dirty work of others. It is also the source of the English idiom 'a cat's paw', defined in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as 'one used by another as a tool'. There are earlier idiomatic allusions in 15th century Burgundian sources. Jean Mi√©lot records the saying c'est un bon jeu de chat et singe (it's a cat and monkey game) in his Proverbes (1456) and there is another apparent reference to the story in a poem in Jean Molinet's Faictz et dictz. In the following century, Jean-Antoine de Ba√Øf has the version faire comme le singe, tirer les marrons du feu avec la patte du chat in his Mimes, enseignements et proverbes (1575) and John Florio includes the saying in his collection of idioms Second Frutes (1591).Elizabeth Dawes, \\"Pulling the chestnuts out of the fire\\" in Animals and the symbolic in mediaeval art and literature (ed) L.A.J.R. Houwen, Groningen 1997, pp.155-69 However, the earliest surviving texts relating the story date from the mid-16th century and some of these have a puppy in place of a cat as the monkey's victim. Johannes Sambucus reports it as happening recently in the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom in his Emblemata (1564). The Latin poem there continues, 'A small monkey gave us an example noteworthy and amusing for its cunning. For, when he saw the chestnuts buried in the hearth, he began to brush the ash aside but, afraid of the burning coals, he suddenly seized the foot of a sleeping puppy and stole it out.' The fable in Internet Archive. The same story involving a sleeping dog appeared in other emblem books, including the Choice of Emblemes by the English poet Geoffrey Whitney (1586), who draws a political lesson from it in common with the other emblematists: ::Which shewes, when as ambition fowle doth prick ::The hartes of kinges, then there is no remorce, ::But oftentimes, to aunswere theire desire, ::The subjectes feele both famine, sworde and fire. A version in which a cat figures is in Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder's illustrated book of fables, De warachtighe fabulen der dieren (True animal fables, Bruges, 1567), with Flemish verse provided by the foremost Netherlandic emblematist . A French version of the Fabulen was published in 1578 under the title Esbatement moral des animaux.The book can be viewed at fundp.ac.be with the fable and its illustration on pages 63 and 64. Gheeraert's figure had a number of adaptations in the following century. The Dutch poet Joost van den Vondel published an emblematic collection based on his prints, Vorstelijke Warande der Dieren (Princely pleasure-ground of beasts, Amsterdam 1617), in which the poem Den aap en de katte appears. In England the scene was reused as one of twelve circular engravings, intended for trenchers, made in 1630-36. The text around the edge of the picture reads: \\"The Monkey seing nuts in fire Doth force the Cat to plucke them neir; Which showeth the Envious doth not care, Whose House do burne so they have share\\". In Germany it was incorporated into a view of the Schloss Johannisberg wine estate in 's Thesaurus Philopoliticus (later known as the Sciographia Cosmica) of 1623. In this combination of the Emblem book and collection of town plans, the scene of the fable takes place on the lower right and is accompanied by verses illustrating the Latin moral, Alterius Damno Quaeris Lucrum (Another is duped to benefit the greedy).Daniel Meisner, Thesaurus Philo-Politicus. Hoc est: Emblemata, 2, Issue 5, p.23 Elsewhere in Europe, the monkey and cat version appears in Simone Majoli's Latin work Dies caniculares (1588), where it is told of the antics of the pet monkey of Pope Julius II at the start of the century; a little later the story appeared as Un Singe et un Chat in Philippe Deprez's collection of a hundred verse fables, Le Th√©√¢tre des animaux (Paris, 1595). It is from one or other of these last two that La Fontaine is said to have adapted his story. Even before he popularised it, the earlier version had been used by two artists: the Roman painter Tommaso Salini and the Dutch animal painter Abraham Hondius. Both of these illustrate the detail that La Fontaine chose to modify, in which the monkey uses the cat's paw to poke out the chestnuts against its will. A third version of the story, yet again quoted as happening recently, was contained in Gemelli Careri's Voyage round the world (1695) and related by 'the admiral of the Portuguese fleet in India' as witnessed by him.Quoted in a contributor's essay on the cat in The Mirror of Literature, Amusement & Instruction, Vol 24, London 1834, p.165 One of the channels through which the fable was taken to be Aesop's was its inclusion among the hydraulic statues in the labyrinth of Versailles in 1669. These were accompanied by quatrains by Isaac de Benserade, which subsequently appeared in Les fables d'√âsope, mises en fran√ßois, avec le sens moral en quatre vers, & des figures √† chaque fable (Aesop's fables in French, with a verse commentary and illustrations, 1709). Here the initial quatrain refers to the version where force is used ('The monkey looks sprightly/ but the cat doesn't take lightly/ having its paw acquired/ to pull chestnuts from the fire') while the prose telling which follows is of La Fontaine's version. The statue accompanied by De Benserade's verse is described in Daniel Bellamy's 18th century description of the labyrinth: 'Upon a shell composed of brass, and supported by a column erected in the antique taste with the same metal, the spectator is amused with the resemblance of a large fire, from whence issues a torrent of water. Here a monkey appears with a smiling countenance, grasping a cat's paw with his own, whilst the latter is seemingly struggling to get loose.'Ethic Amusements, London 1768, fable 27, p.237 It was a version in which the monkey uses force that was painted by Edwin Landseer in 1824 and by his 19th century imitator (see the gallery below). When the former painting was put up for auction in January 2011, U.S. Christie's recorded that 'The subject of the present painting is taken from the ancient fable traditionally ascribed to Aesop'. While this is far from true, the fable had been appearing in collections of Aesop's Fables since the 17th century. Where the story is ascribed to Aesop, it is in the version where the monkey forcibly uses the cat's paw. La Fontaine's modified version of 1679 can only be regarded as original for the detail of persuasion rather than compulsion. It was translated by neither of La Fontaine's main 18th century English translators, Bernard de Mandeville (1704) and Charles Denis (1754), but was ascribed to him in the verse Flowers of Fable in 1832.Pages 341-2 Charles H. Bennett also included the story in his The Fables of Aesop and Others, translated into Human Nature (1857) under the title of \\"The Cat's Paw\\". Referring back to the plot of Oliver Twist, Bennett's cat acts as thief's apprentice to the monkey. Meaning and use A satirical French view of military glory from Napoleonic times La Fontaine applies the fable to statecraft, :No more are the princes, by flattery paid :For furnishing help in a different trade, :And burning their fingers to bring :More power to some mightier king, and was later followed in this by political cartoonists. One English example, dating from 1766 and titled \\"The Cat's Paw\\", satirises a political alliance of the time and represents the Earl of Bute as a monkey, using the paw of the feline Earl of Chatham to extract chestnuts from a fire. Use of the idiom at this date is one of the earliest examples in English.The Merriam-Webster Dictionary gives 1769 as the earliest use in this sense The satirist Peter Pindar (John Wolcot) continued the political use of the fable by including a lengthy reference to it in his ode ‚ÄúTo the Chancellor of the Exchequer‚Äù (1801), in the context of the argument over Catholic Emancipation.Odes to Ins and Outs Ode 4, p.19 Soon after, the same issue was illustrated in a caricature from 1804 titled \\"The monkey and the cat's paw, a fable from Esop\\". The cat's paw title was to be used once again in a cartoon relating to the political maneuvering that preceded the passing of the English Reform Act in 1832. In this King William IV is the cat, being coaxed by the bewigged Lord Chancellor Henry Brougham, depicted as a monkey seated at his side, to pull the hot iron of reform from a blazing fire. In this case the reference is to La Fontaine's version of the story. Another contemporary source to draw a parallel between the passing of the bill and the fable was the satirical paper Figaro in London.June 23 1832, p.113 There the claim is made that the Irish members of Parliament halted agitations for wider representation while the Reform Bill was being passed and were now cheated of a similar reward. The political leader Daniel O'Connell is likened to the cat in the fable and the report is followed by the poem, ‚ÄúThe grey monkey and the Irish cat‚Äù, concluding with the lines ‚ÄúAnd thus 'twill always be, whoever lingers/ About the grate is sure to burn his fingers‚Äù. The idiom of getting one's fingers burned alludes, according to Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, ‚Äúto taking chestnuts from the fire‚Äù.Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, archived online In France the fable was often used to satirise the ambitious sacrificing the life of others for their own ends. The cartoon Bertrand avec Raton s'amusent √† tirer les marrons du feu, dating from Napoleonic times, pictures a red uniformed monkey marshall guiding a blue-uniformed infantryman in the task. The theme reappeared in the broadside La Caricature with the title \\"The monkey and the cat: a military pastime\\". Another cartoon has a marquis urging a barefoot patriotic workman to take his place on a republican barricade, while chuckling to himself that soon the artistocratic exiles will return with their allies to impose a renewed feudalism. This too is titled \\"Bertrand et Raton\\". The French dramatist Eug√®ne Scribe gave the same title to his social comedy of 1833. Subtitled l'art de conspirer (the art of conspiracy), it has also been translated as 'The school for politicians'There is an online edition and is a reworking of a play of the same name by Louis-Beno√Æt Picard (1805). It is ostensibly based on an episode of Danish history and concerns a bourgeois dupe caught up in political intrigue. In reality it satirises the July Revolution of 1830.Stephen S. Stanton, Scribe's \\"Bertrand Et Raton\\": A Well-Made Play, The Tulane Drama Review Vol. 2, No. 1, Nov., 1957, pp. 58-70; available online In the Netherlands the words of Vondel's Den aap en de katte were set for a cappella male chorus by Sem Dresden to celebrate the centenary of the Royal Dutch Choir in 1953. In the aftermath of World War II, the closing moral that rulers are careless of the suffering of others in fulfilling their ambition had special resonance.

Viglius (October 19, 1507, SwichumMay 5, 1577) was the name taken by Wigle Aytta van Zwichem, a Dutch statesman and jurist, a Frisian by birth.  Biography  He studied at various universities‚ÄîLouvain, Dole and Bourges among others‚Äîdevoting himself mainly to the study of jurisprudence, and afterwards visited many of the principal seats of learning in Europe. His great abilities attracted the notice of Erasmus and other celebrated men, and his renown was soon wide and general. Having lectured on law at the universities of Bourges and Padua, he accepted a judicial position under the bishop of M√ºnster which he resigned in 1535 to become assessor of the imperial court of justice (Reichskammergericht). He would not, however, undertake the post of tutor to Philip, son of Emperor Charles V. Nor would he accept any of the many lucrative and honorable positions offered him by various European princes, preferring instead to remain at the University of Ingolstadt, where for five years he occupied a professorial chair. In 1542 the official connection of Viglius with the Netherlands began. At the emperor's invitation he became a member of the council of Mechlin, and some years later president of that body. Other responsible positions were entrusted to him, and he was soon one of the most trusted of the ministers of Charles V, whom he accompanied during the War of the League of Schmalkalden in 1546. His rapid rise in the emperor's favor was probably due to his immense store of learning, which was useful in asserting the imperial rights where disputes arose between the empire and the estates. left He was generally regarded as the author of the edict against toleration issued in 1550. A charge which he denied, maintaining, on the contrary, that he had vainly tried to induce Charles to modify its rigour. When the emperor abdicated in 1555 Viglius was anxious to retire also, but at the instance of King Philip II he remained at his post and was rewarded by being made coadjutor abbot of St. Bavon, and in other ways. Portrait of Viglius as Chancellor of the Order of the Golden Fleece, by Jacob de Punder. In 1559, when Margaret, Duchess of Parma became regent of the Netherlands, Viglius was an important member of the small circle who assisted her in the work of government. He was president of the privy council, member, and subsequently president, of the state council, and a member of the committee of the state council called the consulta. But his desire to resign soon returned. In 1565 he was allowed to give up the presidency of the state council, but was persuaded to retain his other posts. However, he had lost favor with Margaret, who accused him to Philip of dishonesty and simony, while his orthodoxy was suspected. When the Duke of Alva arrived in the Netherlands Viglius at first assisted him; but he subsequently opposed the duke's scheme of extortion, and sought to induce Philip himself to visit the Low Countries. His health was now impaired and his work was nearly over. Having suffered a short imprisonment with the other members of the state council in 1576, he died at Brussels on the May 5, 1577, and was buried in the abbey of St. Bavon. Viglius was an advocate of peace and moderation, and as such could not expect support or sympathy from hardliners from either side of the dispute and his moderate position became untenable. He was undoubtedly avaricious, and accumulated great wealth, part of which he left to found a hospital at his native place, Swichum, and a college at the University of Louvain. He married a rich lady, Jacqueline Damant, but had no children. He wrote a Tagebuch des Schmalkaldischen Donaukriegs, edited by A. von Drullel (Munich, 1877), and some of his lectures were published under the title Cornmentarii in decem Instilutionum i1ulos (Lyon, 1564).

Founded in 1963, the conference links a general audience with the world's foremost scholars and researchers in conversations centered on contemporary issues related to the natural and social sciences. It is the first ongoing academic conference in the United States to have the official authorization of the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden. History Gustavus Adolphus College was founded by Swedish immigrants in 1862 and throughout its history, has continued to honor its Swedish heritage. As the College prepared to build a new science hall in the early 1960s, College officials asked the Nobel Foundation for permission to name the building the Alfred Nobel Hall of Science as a memorial to the great Swedish inventor and philanthropist. Permission was granted, and the facility's dedication ceremony in 1963 included 26 Nobel laureates and officials from the Nobel Foundation. Following the 1963 Nobel Prize ceremonies in Stockholm, College representatives met with Nobel Foundation officials, asking them to endorse an annual science conference at the College and to allow use of the Nobel name to establish credibility and high standards. At the urging of several prominent Nobel laureates, the foundation granted the request and the first conference was held at the College in January 1965. For four and a half decades, world-class research scientists and scholars have come together to discuss leading topics in science with audiences of thousands.  Mission  The goal of the conference is to bring cutting-edge science issues to the attention of an audience of students and interested adults, to engage the panelists and the audience in a discussion of the moral and societal impact of these issues, and to continue to attract world-class speakers. Beginning with the help of an advisory committee composed of Nobel laureates such as Glenn Seaborg, Philip Showalter Hench, and Sir John Eccles, the conferences have been consistently successful in attracting the world's foremost authorities as speakers. Past speakers have included David H. Hubel, Fritz Lipmann, Sir Harold Walter Kroto, and Mitchell Jay Feigenbaum. Fifty- nine Nobel laureates have served as speakers, five of whom were awarded the Noble prize after speaking at the Nobel conference at Gustavus. The Nobel conference has a focus on scientific topics such as \\"Medicine: Prescription for Tomorrow\\" (2006), \\"The Legacy of Einstein\\" (2005), \\"The Science of Aging\\" (2004), \\"The Nature of Nurture\\" (2002), \\"Virus: The Human Connection\\" (1998), and \\"The New Shape of Matter: Materials Challenge Science\\" (1995). The social sciences are also well represented and many topics are interdisciplinary; focusing on economics, politics, the social sciences, and philosophy. For example, the 2016 Nobel Conference: In Search of Economic Balance brought economists from around the world to discuss the challenges facing real-world implementation of economic theories. The Nobel conference is open to the general public. Current The 2017 Nobel Conference is titled \\"Reproductive Technology: How Far Do We Go?\\" and took place October 3‚Äì4, 2017 in Saint Peter, Minnesota at Gustavus Adolphus College.

The season was marked bt a major controversy at the end. BSK Belgrade finished the season at top, however because they fielded an unregistered player, they had to replay their two last matches. Having refused to play the first one against their Belgrade rivals Jugoslavija, a 3-0 defeat was registered, and later their 2-1 victory over Hajduk was not enough to grant them the title. Bosnian club SA≈†K dissolved before the season began and the clubs participating was reduced to five, all Serbian or Croatian. 1929 was the first year in which the championship used a double round-robin style league, and so the stats for each team began having higher numbers. Controversial end of the championship The season featured a good deal of controversy as the team that finished the season in top spot was BSK, not Hajduk Split. However, because they were judged to have had an improperly registered player on their roster (Du≈°an Markoviƒá), BSK got ordered by the FA to replay their last two matches of the season: home match against SK Jugoslavija and the away match at Hajduk Split (both of which BSK originally won: 5-1 and 3-1, respectively). Furious with what they considered to be an unfair decision, BSK refused to re-play the matches. They didn't show up to replay their arch cross-town rivals SK Jugoslavija and the match was eventually registered 3-0 in Jugoslavija's favour. As for re-playing the second match at Hajduk, BSK originally also refused, but were eventually forced to travel to Split by the FA under a threat of heavy sanctions. Though re-gathered and put together in hasty fashion, BSK players still managed to beat Hajduk 2-1. However, it still wasn't enough for the title as Hajduk had more points due to BSK refusal to play Jugoslavija.Konflikt oko preseljenja; 'Blic, 9 April 2010 BSK appealed, launching a formal complaint with the FA (Jugoslovenski nogometni savez). Their appeal was scheduled to be heard during the next scheduled FA assembly that took place on March 24, 1929, at the FA headquarters in Zagreb. The initiative for the relocation of FA headquarters from Zagreb to Belgrade was also discussed at the same assembly, causing high tensions and incidents that even police had to intervene. The assembly was interrupted and stopped following the incident, which meant that BSK's appeal was not even discussed.Konflikt oko preseljenja; 'Blic, 9 April 2010 Qualifiers This season introduced a change in which there was no longer directly qualified teams, and this meant that all teams had to go through one round of qualifiers. As in previous seasons, the subassociations of Belgrade and Zagreb provided the first two teams, while the access to the rest of the subassociations was only provided to the correspondent subassociation champion.

Its design was inspired by the French transatlantic passenger ship SS Normandie in addition to featuring the same art deco design as the ocean liner that inspired it, and the hotel's original roof sign was one of the two signs that adorned the top deck of the SS Normandie but were removed from it during an early refitting. It is an example of what came to be known as the Streamline Moderne architecture style. History The Normandie Hotel was the brainchild of Puerto Rican engineer F√©lix Ben√≠tez Rexach. The engineer met his future wife while on a trip aboard the Normandie. As a tribute to his French wife, Moineau, Ben√≠tez decided to construct a structure that imitated the lavish settings of the ship. Designed by architect Ra√∫l Reichard (1908‚Äì1996), the hotel began construction in 1938. The hotel's exterior was designed to resemble a luxury ocean liner, elongated and curved in front and back, with portal shaped lights on the facade of the 6th floor, as well as on the front on all floors except the front entrance and 2nd floor. Inside, the hotel features art deco design, complete with Roman, Egyptian, and French details, high ceilings, corridors looking down into a central skylighted atrium, banisters that resemble those on ships on the edges of all floors except the lobby, a pool outside in the back shaped similarly to the hotel, and had blue or orange awnings above the windows on the upper floors until the hotel closed in the 1960s. Designers and artists from Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, France, and Spain all contributed to the hotel's overall construction. When it opened on October 10, 1942, it became an instant sensation among the island's social elite. Completed at a cost of more than US$2,000,000, the hotel catered to many major Hollywood and Latin American film stars such as Cantinflas, Libertad Lamarque and Jorge Negrete. The hotel also served as a performing arts venue for many of Puerto Rico's top entertainers, such as Ruth Fern√°ndez, Myrta Silva, Sylvia Rexach, and Carmen Delia Dipini. After being closed and abandoned in the 1960s, the hotel was restored in the early 1990s. Afterwards, it underwent massive renovations due to heavy damage caused by Hurricane Georges in 1998. After storm-related damages were repaired, the hotel remained in business until 2004, when another renovation project commenced. In early 2005, the 173-room hotel reopened after its refurbishing and would operate as a Boutique Hotel for 4 years, before closing again by late 2009, since then the hotel has remained unused and abandoned for over a decade by 2019. In 2015 the hotel's roof sign was removed, and only the structure that held up the letters of the sign remains. The Normandie Hotel was purchased on August 8, 2013, by Ben Medetsky and Jack Polatsek of Interra Capital Group for nearly US$4,000,000 but after initial plans for redevelopment of the hotel, the group decided to sell it. In 2014, then in the spring of 2017 and again in the spring of 2018, investors were considering the purchase of the Normandie Hotel. In August 2014, it remained abandoned, locked up, deteriorated, and eventually was vandalized. . Its entire electrical, plumbing and other infrastructure would need to be entirely redone if the property is purchased and reopened. Recognition The Normandie Hotel was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1980.Puerta de Tierra: Hotel Normandie: Popular culture * The music video for singer Sade Adu's song \\"King of Sorrow\\" (from her Lovers Rock album) was filmed in and around the hotel by director Sophie Muller.King of Sorrow music video from YouTube * The hotel served as a locale for one of the four stories that helped compose the storyline for the 2001 film 12 Horas directed by Puerto Rican director Ra√∫l Marchand S√°nchez. * The lobby of the hotel was used to shoot scenes from the 2009 film A Perfect Getaway.

Huntington (DD-781), an , is the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Robert Kingsbury Huntington, a naval aviator and member of Torpedo Squadron 8. The entire squadron was lost during the Battle of Midway. Robert K. Huntington (DD-781) was laid down on 29 February 1944 by Todd Pacific Shipyards, Seattle, Washington and launched on 5 December 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Ruth Arnold Welsh. The ship was commissioned on 3 March 1945, Commander J. W. Ramey in command. History Robert K. Huntington joined the Pacific Fleet 31 May 1945 and from 27 June to 16 August escorted ships between Eniwetok and Ulithi. On 28 August, she joined the Fast Carrier Task Force off the Japanese coast and was one of the ships which escorted battleship into Tokyo Bay to receive the official Japanese surrender. She then returned to San Diego, carrying 100 Marines home. In the spring of 1946, she returned to the Marshalls as a unit of TF 1 during Operation Crossroads, the first atomic bomb test at Bikini. In July, she witnessed the air burst from a considerable distance, and the more spectacular underwater blast from the comparatively close range of 10 miles. Until early in 1949, Robert K. Huntington operated and trained off the west coast, in Hawaiian waters, and in Far Eastern waters with Task Force 38, the Pacific Mobile Striking Force. In April the destroyer was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet where she was assigned to a carrier task force, then undergoing extensive antisubmarine warfare training. She spent the following winter in Arctic waters; then in February 1950 headed for the Caribbean to participate in fleet exercises. In December Robert K. Huntington deployed for the first time to the Mediterranean and duty with the 6th Fleet. In the spring she returned to Norfolk and for the next two years she alternated cold weather operations with Caribbean cruises; then from the spring of 1953 until the summer of 1955 rotated between duty in the Mediterranean and exercises with the 2nd Fleet off the U.S. east coast and in the Caribbean. In July 1955 she was in the North Atlantic guarding president Eisenhower's plane route as he traveled to and from the Geneva Conference. Following a Caribbean cruise in the spring of 1956, Robert K. Huntington conducted a midshipman training cruise to Europe and the Caribbean. In 1957 she operated in the Caribbean and then in European waters for NATO exercises. In both 1958 and 1959, Robert K. Huntington made 6-month Mediterranean deployments, while she spent most of 1960 undergoing a fleet rehabilitation and modernization (FRAM) overhaul and conversion. Emerging from the shipyard, the \\"new\\" destroyer steamed to her new home port, Mayport, Florida and through 1961 operated off the U.S. east coast and in the Caribbean. Robert K. Huntington underway after her FRAM II-modernisation. Employed in ASW exercises off the east coast during the first half of 1962, Robert K. Huntington deployed to the Mediterranean 3 August, and operated in the Black Sea 3 to 12 October. She returned to Mayport 3 March 1963 and spent much of the rest of that year in the Caribbean. For the next 4 years she operated off the east coast, in the Caribbean, and in the Mediterranean. In late 1967, she deployed to the Mediterranean as part of a hunter-killer force. She returned to Mayport 16 December 1967. In early 1968 Robert K. Huntington continued to operate off the east coast and in the Caribbean until transferring to the Pacific Fleet. In October she deployed to the Far East for six months, operating off Vietnam. She returned to Mayport on 17 April 1969 and remained in-port undergoing minor repairs until July 1969. In July 1969, Robert K. Huntington received a new assignment and a new home port. Operating out of Bayonne, New Jersey she was active in the Atlantic and Caribbean with the Reserve program until October 1973. At that time, as a result of a survey, she was found to be unfit for further service and was decommissioned 31 October at Newport, Rhode Island Robert K. Huntington was stricken from the Navy List on the same day and sold to the Venezuelan Navy in which she was renamed Falcon. Robert K. Huntington earned two battle stars for Vietnam service.

Pigs are fattened in a process similar to (and as controversial as) gavage to make them as large as possible in preparation for contests and awards at the festival. The heaviest pig is declared the winner and the owner may receive a prize. The winning pig and other pigs entered into the contest are ritually killed as a sacrifice to a city god or a local deity, ironically a popular one being the deified Buddhist monk Qingshui Zushi. After being sacrificed, the hair of the winning pig is removed or the bristles shaved into patterns, and the skin is stretched across a metal frame. Further decorations are added such as placing a pineapple in the pig's mouth. The stretched skin, along with the carcasses or stretched skins of the other fattened pigs, are then paraded on a float. Many Holy pigs end up weighing over 800 kg whereas a normal pig would weigh only 120 kg. In urban areas with no access to farms housing such large animals, or places where objections based on cruelty to the pigs has been raised, the contests instead have become art projects for children to create decorated pig statues.http://www.redorbit.com/news/international/234273/taiwan_god_pig_sacrifice_religious_rite_or_cruelty/ Controversy The practice of feeding the pigs to become so heavy has been criticised as inhumane and cruel, partly because the great weights limit the pig's movements and strains their internal organs. It has been claimed that some growers cheat by force-feeding the pigs lead or sand before they are weighed.

He was named an executive in residence at Columbia Business School in 2017.  Early life  Born in Long Beach, California, Lundgren was one of six children. He was the only member of the six that went to college because of his parents' limited financial capacity. His parents stopped paying for his tuition, seeing Lundgren did not have good grades. In response, Lundgren \\"found a job at a local restaurant in Tucson, where he was responsible for cracking oysters and peeling shrimp.\\" He was eventually \\"promoted to a waiter, then the head waiter, and then the head manager of the restaurant.\\" Through his job, he was able to graduate from the University of Arizona.

The company reported that of its top 15 best-performing geographic markets in the key holiday selling month of December 2008, 13 were My Macy's pilot districts. The My Macy's organizational model was then rolled out across the U.S. in 2009 and became a Harvard Business School case study for successful localization within a national retailing model. Lundgren also led Macy's significant investments in ecommerce and mobile shopping, which led it to become one of the largest online retailers in America. Under Lundgren, Macy's, Inc. acquired beauty retailer Bluemercury in 2015. Lundgren has been awarded numerous honors. In 2008, he received the Gold Medal Award from the National Retail Federation, considered the retailing industry's pre-eminent honor. In spring 2008, he was presented with Carnegie Hall's third annual Medal of Excellence for outstanding philanthropic leadership in the arts.

Plot Zachary \\"Zach\\" Hutton is a successful author who has a weakness for alcohol and beautiful women. Zach's mistress walks in on him in the process of cheating on her with her attractive hairdresser, followed by his estranged wife Alex discovering his mistress about to shoot him with his revolver. Following the breakup of those relationships, Zach engages in a long period of binge-drinking and solace- seeking with a string of women. He avoids work, continues to strain relations with his ex-wife and drunkenly attends a formal party dressed in a genie's costume. Zach's affairs include one with a volatile woman named Molly who deliberately leaves him hooked up too long to a skin-treatment electro-therapy machine that gives his body quivering spasms from head to toe. He also has a one-night stand with a remarkably muscular female bodybuilder named Lonnie, telling her before sex that he feels \\"like Mrs. Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\" One gag scene is portrayed in total darkness, with Zach wearing a luminous condom as he prepares to have sex with yet another woman he has just met, Amy. When her boyfriend returns to the hotel room similarly equipped, the two men engage in a frantic fight, their glow-in-the-dark attire bouncing crazily across the darkened room. After disrupting his ex-wife's wedding day, it finally dawns on Zach just how out of control his lifestyle has become. He sobers up, abstains from womanizing, and begins to write again. Achieving the trifecta of recovery that Alex predicted he couldn't achieve, he wins back her love.

Moineau wasn't satisfied and Ben√≠tez Rexach decided then to construct a hotel with the form of a great transatlantic vessel. Designed by architect Ra√∫l Reichard (1908‚Äì1996), the hotel began construction in 1938. He named the \\"Normandie Hotel\\" in honor of the French liner and presented it as a gift to his beloved wife and to the people of Puerto Rico.

Carter is the eldest child of former President Jimmy Carter and First Lady Rosalynn Carter. Early life and education Carter was born at the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth in Portsmouth, Virginia. Raised in Plains, Georgia, he spent winters working at his father's peanut farm warehouse, where his wages began at 10 cents per hour. Carter struggled when he first entered college in 1965, attending Georgia Tech, Emory University, and Georgia Southwestern State University before enlisting in the United States Navy in April 1968 at the suggestion of his father. Carter served during the Vietnam War, on the salvage ship . He received a \\"less than honorable\\" general discharge in late 1970 after he and 53 classmates were caught smoking marijuana at the Naval Reactors Facility in Idaho Falls, Idaho. Carter returned to Georgia Tech, earning a degree in nuclear physics. Following graduation, he immediately entered law school at the University of Georgia, receiving his Juris Doctor in 1975.  Career  In 1981, Carter moved to Chicago, where he worked for the Chicago Board of Trade and Citibank. =2006 senatorial campaign= Carter moved to Nevada in 2002 and ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the United States Senate as a Democrat against incumbent Republican Senator John Ensign of Nevada in the 2006 election. Carter won the Democratic nomination on August 15, 2006 against opponent Ruby Jee Tun, a teacher from Carson City. Carter's primary issues were his opposition to the Iraq War and his concerns about the healthcare system, especially what he characterized as its failure to meet its commitment to veterans. Carter, who said he and his wife have lived in Las Vegas since 2002, acknowledged that his recent arrival might be his greatest hurdle in the race. Carter lost the 2006 Nevada election to John Ensign by a 55% to 41% margin. Carter was hospitalized for almost two weeks with colitis at the beginning of September 2006, falling ill following a trip to Atlanta for the birth of his first grandchild. He spent two days in intensive care, but had recovered by the beginning of October.  Personal life  His first marriage was to Juliet \\"Judy\\" Langford Carter. They have two children, Jason and Sarah. Jason has written a book, Power Lines, about his experiences doing humanitarian work in South Africa, and was elected to the Georgia State Senate in 2010. Sarah Carter, a PhD candidate in neuroscience, worked for his campaign and blogs for the Daily Kos. After his divorce, Carter married Elizabeth Brasfield on May 15, 1992, and they lived in Bermuda, where they started an investment company, and then moved to Las Vegas, Nevada in 2003, where he formed the investment consultant firm Carter Global. Stepson John Chuldenko (from his current wife's first marriage) is a film director and has directed television ads for the campaign. Stepdaughter Sarah Reynolds (n√©e Chuldenko) is a book illustrator (for Jimmy Carter's poetry volume) and painter who has worked with Jeff Koons, and is married to Australian artist Stephen Reynolds.

It was first described by the French naturalist Ren√©-Primev√®re Lesson in 1831, its specific epithet from the Latin adjective sanguinolentus, \\"bloodied\\", referring to its red plumage. Taxonomy This species is sometimes placed in a genus of its own as Phlogothraupis sanguinolenta, and a genetic study suggests that it is less closely related to the other Ramphocelus tanagers than they are to each other. Its closest relative is the masked crimson tanager. Description Crimson-collared tanagers average long. The adult plumage is black with a red collar covering the nape, neck, and breast (remarkably similar to the pattern of the male crimson-collared grosbeak). All tail coverts are also red. The bill is striking pale blue and the legs are blue-gray. In adults, the irides are crimson, contrary to what is shown in Howell and Webb. Females average slightly duller than males, but are sometimes indistinguishable from them. Juvenile birds are similar except that the hood is dull red, the black areas are tinged with brown, and the breast is mottled red and black. Young birds also have a duller bill color. Crimson-collared tanager in Costa Rica Vocalizations are high-pitched and sibilant. There are several calls; one rendered as ssii-p is given both when perched and in flight. The song is jerky and consists of two-to-four-note phrases separated by pauses, tueee-teew, chu- chee-wee-chu, teweee. Distribution and habitat The crimson-collared tanager ranges from southern Veracruz and northern Oaxaca in Mexico through the Atlantic slope of Central America, to the highlands of western Panama. It inhabits the edges of humid evergreen forests and second growth, where it is often seen in pairs at middle to upper levels. Behaviour =Breeding= The nest is a cup built of such materials as moss, rootlets and strips of large leaves such as banana or Heliconia, and is placed at middle height in a tree at a forest edge. The female usually lays two eggs, pale blue with blackish spots. =Conservation= Because the species is not threatened, the population size is very large and the trend appears to be stable, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/Crimson-collared- Tanager References * crimson-collared tanager Birds of Central America Birds of Belize crimson-collared tanager ","title":"Crimson-collared tanager"},{"id":"2841497","text":"WQMP is a radio station licensed to Daytona Beach serving the Orlando and Space Coast areas of Central Florida. Owned by Entercom, it broadcasts an alternative rock format branded as \\"FM 101.9\\". Its studios are located in Maitland and the transmitter is in Orange City. History =Early years= 101.9 began as WMFJ-FM on November 1, 1967. Sister to AM 1450 in Daytona Beach, WMFJ-FM was an automated beautiful music station known as Stereo 102. The station's calls were changed to WQXQ in 1973, and the format became automated Album Oriented Rock as Q102. Despite the rock format's success, management felt that a top 40 hit station would have more mass appeal, and so Q102 changed from rock to Top 40 in 1976; initially the station remained automated, but by the end of the 1970s it employed a staff of live and local announcers. The station changed its calls to WDOQ in 1980, but the format remained top 40, the moniker remained Q102, and the ratings remained high. Due to new competition in the Daytona market from WNFI in 1982, Q102 began to more aggressively target the Orlando market as opposed to only Daytona Beach. Although plans for a big 100,000-watt signal that would have extended to St. Augustine, Gainesville and Ocala were scrapped, WDOQ's listenership continued to grow. In 1984, WDOQ was sold and adopted the new calls WCFI, with a satellite-fed adult contemporary format from Transtar (now Dial Global), using the I-4 (a tribute to Miami's WINZ-FM) and later Sunny 102 monikers. In 1985, the station was purchased by Duffy Broadcasting for $7.7 million. On June 16, 1986, the format and calls changed again to WORZ, Z-102FM, a classic rock station. In 1987, it was sold to Beasley-Reed Broadcasting for $9.2 million. =102 Jamz= On April 1, 1988, the call letters were changed to WJHM, and the station adopted a CHR/Urban format targeting a multicultural audience as 102 Jamz under the direction of Program Director Duff Lindsey and consultant Jerry Clifton. The station was an immediate success with listeners and within two years, ascended to the top of the 12+ Arbitron Ratings. Some of the DJs included Joe Nasty doing mornings, Magic Scott (now Cadillac Jack in Philadelphia) doing afternoons, and Cedric Hollywood as mid-day jock (also Music Director). WJHM was purchased by Chancellor Media in 1997. In late 1998, longtime music director Cedric Hollywood, who had been with the station since its inception in 1988, left \\"102 Jamz\\" to go to WEDR in Miami. Soon after, it started adding urban based songs to its playlist. Although the station was labeled as \\"Rhythmic\\", WJHM remained an Urban station at its core, but would later drop rhythmic-based songs when it got competition when WCFB acquired an urban AC format, resulting in WJHM shifting to urban altogether. The late 1990s brought a time of mergers with Chancellor merging with Evergreen and forming AMFM, Inc., who hold ownership of WJHM until it merged with Clear Channel in 2000. To comply with FCC ownership rules, Clear Channel sold WJHM to Infinity Broadcasting (later CBS Radio) in 2001. It briefly reverted to rhythmic by 2005 to go up against WPYO, although this was unsuccessful due to WCFB (WPYO's sister station) having almost no competitor during the rhythmic experiment. WJHM shortly reverted to urban to challenge WCFB. Given WJHM's Urban heritage status in Orlando, it was in competition with both WCFB and WPYO (both owned by Cox Radio). Although it was one of the top ranking radio stations in the market, WJHM suffered the rare setback of ranking behind WPYO in the Arbitron ratings, rare to have an Urban format rank behind a Rhythmic. WJHM's logo under previous \\"102 JAMZ\\" branding In the fall of 2011, WJHM began adding Rhythmic product again. Despite its continued urban contemporary tenure per Nielsen BDS reports rather than being a rhythmic, it continued on Mediabase's rhythmic panel during this tenure. Since the shift back to Rhythmic, WJHM added more pop tracks, such as You Make Me Feel... by Cobra Starship & Moves Like Jagger by Maroon 5. This move was due to WJHM looking at challenging WXXL, the market's only Top 40/CHR and former sister station. However, Cox-owned WPYO, whose Rhythmic direction slightly favored hip hop but whose playlist was almost identical to WJHM, continued to surpass WJHM in the ratings. In late January 2012, WJHM made more changes by dropping Rickey Smiley's syndicated morning show in favor of a more music-intensive morning block,\\"Smiley Out As 102 Jamz Makes Changes\\" from All Access (January 30, 2012) terminated 18-year air-staffer Jay Love from the roster,\\"Jay Love And WJHM Split After 18 Years In Orlando\\" from All Access (January 27, 2012) and began transitioning to a rhythmic top 40 direction altogether, as their playlist began including artists like Jessie J, Avicii, Kelly Clarkson, fun., The Wanted, and Adele. It also dropped their longtime slogan \\"Non-Stop Hip-Hop and R&B;\\", replacing it with \\"102 Minutes of Commercial-Free Music\\". The non- urban content that WJHM plays also receives airplay at both WXXL and adult top 40 WOMX, WJHM's sister station. By February 22, 2012, the station completed the shift to Rhythmic Top 40, joining the market's existing rhythmic WPYO as Nielsen BDS moved it to the Top40/Rhythmic panel citing a low emphasis on urban contemporary tracks and since making the transition adding more Pop tracks. Along with these changes, it dropped the Sunday morning gospel programming syndicated from WVEE, although WJHM's HD2 subchannel broadcasts a Gospel format full-time. Between 2000 and early 2012, WJHM was one of CBS Radio's only young demographic-targeting Urban stations along with Atlanta's WVEE-FM and Charlotte's WPEG, although all of them are in the southern United States. Its sister station WPGC-FM in Washington, D.C.‚ÄìBaltimore, Maryland was an urban contemporary reporter per Nielsen BDS and CBS Radio from 1997 to 2012, while they reported to the rhythmic contemporary panel at Mediabase, due to being a hybrid of both formats (also known as \\"Churban\\"), despite Radio One having WKYS and WERQ-FM directly competing in the area. WPGC returned to the BDS Rhythmic reporting panel in June 2012. =101.9 AMP Radio= Logo of AMP Radio (2014-2017) On February 11, 2014, in the early morning hours, 101.9 dropped the \\"Jamz\\" branding after 26 years and began stunting with a loop of the song \\"Get Lucky\\" by Daft Punk. At 10:19 that morning, WJHM rebranded as 101.9 AMP Radio and shifted to top 40/CHR altogether, putting it in line with CBS Radio's \\"AMP Radio\\" branding, which favors rhythmic pop and dance hits. The first song on \\"AMP Radio\\" was \\"Timber\\" by Pitbull.http://www.cflradio.net/101.9_WJHM_AMP_Radio.mp3 Despite the rebranding, WJHM continued to lag in Arbitron ratings behind CHR competitor WXXL and its previous competitor, rhythmic CHR station WPYO. On January 20, 2016, WJHM changed its call letters to WQMP to match the \\"AMP Radio\\" branding. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. =Alt 101.9/FM 101.9= On November 29, 2017, at 3 p.m., after playing ‚ÄúEnd Game‚Äù by Taylor Swift, WQMP flipped to alternative rock as Alt 101.9‚Äîjoining several other former \\"AMP Radio\\"-branded stations in switching to the format and brand after the completion of the Entercom merger. The change brought the format back to a full-market signal in Orlando for the first time since 2008, when sister station WOCL flipped to classic hits. The most recent analog broadcast station to air the format full-time, Cox Media's W297BB/WCFB-HD2, was aired on a translator and an HD sub-channel, and aired from June 2014 to January 2016. Elsewhere in the Orlando market, iHeartMedia's talk-formatted WTKS-FM features alternative on nights and weekends, and is also aired on two HD subchannels in the Orlando market, WOCL HD2 and WJRR HD3, the latter of which also uses the brand Alt as standardized by iHeartMedia; this name conflict resulted in WQMP quietly changing its on-air brand to FM 101.9 on December 4 that year.Alt 101.9 Orlando Quickly Rebrands as FM 101.9 Radioinsight - December 4, 2017 WQMP's flip to alternative made former sister station WXXL the de facto CHR station in Orlando, until WPYO flipped to CHR from an urban-leaning rhythmic contemporary format in April 2018. HD Radio subchannels =WQMP-HD2= WQMP activated its HD2 subchannel at the same time as starting its HD radio operations in the 2000s, which originally carried an urban gospel format, branded as ‚Äú102 GOSPEL JAMZ‚Äù, from the 2000s until 2018. In August 2019, WQMP-HD2 was supposed to flip to \\"Channel Q\\", an LGBTQ-oriented talk/dance music format based in Los Angeles. Since the HD2 stream did not appear on the station, it was placed on the HD2 subchannel of sister station WOMX-FM in early November 2019. =WQMP-HD3= As of July 2019, WQMP-HD3 was carrying a Haitian format from an unknown source. The HD2 and HD3 subchannels were removed around early 2020.

For example, modern conventional computers, including specialized supercomputers, typically have vector operations that simultaneously perform operations such as the following four additions (via SIMD or SPMD hardware): :begin{align} c_1 & = a_1 + b_1  c_2 & = a_2 + b_2  c_3 & = a_3 + b_3  c_4 & = a_4 + b_4 end{align} However, in most programming languages one typically writes loops that sequentially perform additions of many numbers. Here is an example of such a loop, written in C: for (i=0; i A vectorizing compiler transforms such loops into sequences of vector operations. These vector operations perform additions on length-four (in our example) blocks of elements from the arrays \`a\`, \`b\` and \`c\`. Automatic vectorization is a major research topic in computer science. Background Early computers usually had one logic unit, which executed one instruction on one pair of operands at a time. Computer languages and programs therefore were designed to execute in sequence. Modern computers, though, can do many things at once. So, many optimizing compilers perform automatic vectorization, where parts of sequential programs are transformed into parallel operations. Loop vectorization transforms procedural loops by assigning a processing unit to each pair of operands. Programs spend most of their time within such loops. Therefore vectorization can significantly accelerate them, especially over large data sets. Loop vectorization is implemented in Intel's MMX, SSE, and AVX, in Power ISA's AltiVec, and in ARM's NEON instruction sets. Many constraints prevent or hinder vectorization. Sometimes vectorization can slow down execution, for example because of pipeline synchronization or data-movement timing. Loop dependence analysis identifies loops that can be vectorized, relying on the data dependence of the instructions inside loops. Guarantees Automatic vectorization, like any loop optimization or other compile-time optimization, must exactly preserve program behavior. =Data dependencies= All dependencies must be respected during execution to prevent incorrect results. In general, loop invariant dependencies and lexically forward dependencies can be easily vectorized, and lexically backward dependencies can be transformed into lexically forward dependencies. However, these transformations must be done safely, in order to ensure that the dependence between all statements remain true to the original. Cyclic dependencies must be processed independently of the vectorized instructions. =Data precision= Integer precision (bit-size) must be kept during vector instruction execution. The correct vector instruction must be chosen based on the size and behavior of the internal integers. Also, with mixed integer types, extra care must be taken to promote/demote them correctly without losing precision. Special care must be taken with sign extension (because multiple integers are packed inside the same register) and during shift operations, or operations with carry bits that would otherwise be taken into account. Floating-point precision must be kept as well, unless IEEE-754 compliance is turned off, in which case operations will be faster but the results may vary slightly. Big variations, even ignoring IEEE-754 usually signify programmer error. Theory To vectorize a program, the compiler's optimizer must first understand the dependencies between statements and re- align them, if necessary. Once the dependencies are mapped, the optimizer must properly arrange the implementing instructions changing appropriate candidates to vector instructions, which operate on multiple data items. =Building the dependency graph= The first step is to build the dependency graph, identifying which statements depend on which other statements. This involves examining each statement and identifying every data item that the statement accesses, mapping array access modifiers to functions and checking every access' dependency to all others in all statements. Alias analysis can be used to certify that the different variables access (or intersect) the same region in memory. The dependency graph contains all local dependencies with distance not greater than the vector size. So, if the vector register is 128 bits, and the array type is 32 bits, the vector size is 128/32 = 4. All other non-cyclic dependencies should not invalidate vectorization, since there won't be any concurrent access in the same vector instruction. Suppose the vector size is the same as 4 ints: for (i = 0; i < 128; i++) { a[i] = a[i-16]; // 16 > 4, safe to ignore a[i] = a[i-1]; // 1 < 4, stays on dependency graph } =Clustering= Using the graph, the optimizer can then cluster the strongly connected components (SCC) and separate vectorizable statements from the rest. For example, consider a program fragment containing three statement groups inside a loop: (SCC1+SCC2), SCC3 and SCC4, in that order, in which only the second group (SCC3) can be vectorized. The final program will then contain three loops, one for each group, with only the middle one vectorized. The optimizer cannot join the first with the last without violating statement execution order, which would invalidate the necessary guarantees. =Detecting idioms= Some non-obvious dependencies can be further optimized based on specific idioms. For instance, the following self-data-dependencies can be vectorized because the value of the right-hand values (RHS) are fetched and then stored on the left-hand value, so there is no way the data will change within the assignment. a[i] = a[i] + a[i+1]; Self-dependence by scalars can be vectorized by variable elimination. General framework The general framework for loop vectorization is split into four stages: * Prelude: Where the loop-independent variables are prepared to be used inside the loop. This normally involves moving them to vector registers with specific patterns that will be used in vector instructions. This is also the place to insert the run- time dependence check. If the check decides vectorization is not possible, branch to Cleanup. * Loop(s): All vectorized (or not) loops, separated by SCCs clusters in order of appearance in the original code. * Postlude: Return all loop-independent variables, inductions and reductions. * Cleanup: Implement plain (non-vectorized) loops for iterations at the end of a loop that are not a multiple of the vector size or for when run-time checks prohibit vector processing. Run-time vs. compile-time Some vectorizations cannot be fully checked at compile time. For example, library functions can defeat optimization if the data they process is supplied by the caller. Even in these cases, run-time optimization can still vectorize loops on-the-fly. This run- time check is made in the prelude stage and directs the flow to vectorized instructions if possible, otherwise reverts to standard processing, depending on the variables that are being passed on the registers or scalar variables. The following code can easily be vectorized at compile time, as it doesn't have any dependence on external parameters. Also, the language guarantees that neither will occupy the same region in memory as any other variable, as they are local variables and live only in the execution stack. int a[128]; int b[128]; // initialize b for (i = 0; i<128; i++) a[i] = b[i] + 5; On the other hand, the code below has no information on memory positions, because the references are pointers and the memory they point to may overlap. void compute(int *a, int *b) { int i; for (i = 0; i<128; i++, a++, b++) *a = *b + 5; } A quick run-time check on the address of both a and b, plus the loop iteration space (128) is enough to tell if the arrays overlap or not, thus revealing any dependencies. There exist some tools to dynamically analyze existing applications to assess the inherent latent potential for SIMD parallelism, exploitable through further compiler advances and/or via manual code changes. Techniques An example would be a program to multiply two vectors of numeric data. A scalar approach would be something like: for (i = 0; i < 1024; i++) C[i] = A[i]*B[i]; This could be vectorized to look something like: for (i = 0; i < 1024; i+=4) C[i:i+3] = A[i:i+3]*B[i:i+3]; Here, C[i:i+3] represents the four array elements from C[i] to C[i+3] and the vector processor can perform four operations for a single vector instruction. Since the four vector operations complete in roughly the same time as one scalar instruction, the vector approach can run up to four times faster than the original code. There are two distinct compiler approaches: one based on the conventional vectorization technique and the other based on loop unrolling. =Loop-level automatic vectorization= This technique, used for conventional vector machines, tries to find and exploit SIMD parallelism at the loop level. It consists of two major steps as follows. # Find an innermost loop that can be vectorized # Transform the loop and generate vector codes In the first step, the compiler looks for obstacles that can prevent vectorization. A major obstacle for vectorization is true data dependency shorter than the vector length. Other obstacles include function calls and short iteration counts. Once the loop is determined to be vectorizable, the loop is stripmined by the vector length and each scalar instruction within the loop body is replaced with the corresponding vector instruction. Below, the component transformations for this step are shown using the above example. * After stripmining for (i = 0; i < 1024; i+=4) for (ii = 0; ii < 4; ii++) C[i+ii] = A[i+ii]*B[i+ii]; * After loop distribution using temporary arrays for (i = 0; i < 1024; i+=4) { for (ii = 0; ii < 4; ii++) tA[ii] = A[i+ii]; for (ii = 0; ii < 4; ii++) tB[ii] = B[i+ii]; for (ii = 0; ii < 4; ii++) tC[ii] = tA[ii]*tB[ii]; for (ii = 0; ii < 4; ii++) C[i+ii] = tC[ii]; } * After replacing with vector codes for (i = 0; i < 1024; i+=4) { vA = vec_ld( &A;[i] ); vB = vec_ld( &B;[i] ); vC = vec_mul( vA, vB ); vec_st( vC, &C;[i] ); } =Basic block level automatic vectorization= This relatively new technique specifically targets modern SIMD architectures with short vector lengths. Although loops can be unrolled to increase the amount of SIMD parallelism in basic blocks, this technique exploits SIMD parallelism within basic blocks rather than loops. The two major steps are as follows. # The innermost loop is unrolled by a factor of the vector length to form a large loop body. # Isomorphic scalar instructions (that perform the same operation) are packed into a vector instruction if dependencies do not prevent doing so. To show step-by-step transformations for this approach, the same example is used again. * After loop unrolling (by the vector length, assumed to be 4 in this case) for (i = 0; i < 1024; i+=4) { sA0 = ld( &A;[i+0] ); sB0 = ld( &B;[i+0] ); sC0 = sA0 * sB0; st( sC0, &C;[i+0] ); ... sA3 = ld( &A;[i+3] ); sB3 = ld( &B;[i+3] ); sC3 = sA3 * sB3; st( sC3, &C;[i+3] ); } * After packing for (i = 0; i < 1024; i+=4) { (sA0,sA1,sA2,sA3) = ld( &A;[i+0:i+3] ); (sB0,sB1,sB2,sB3) = ld( &B;[i+0:i+3] ); (sC0,sC1,sC2,sC3) = (sA0,sA1,sA2,sA3) * (sB0,sB1,sB2,sB3); st( (sC0,sC1,sC2,sC3), &C;[i+0:i+3] ); } * After code generation for (i = 0; i < 1024; i+=4) { vA = vec_ld( &A;[i] ); vB = vec_ld( &B;[i] ); vC = vec_mul( vA, vB ); vec_st( vC, &C;[i] ); } Here, sA1, sB1, ... represent scalar variables and vA, vB, and vC represent vector variables. Most automatically vectorizing commercial compilers use the conventional loop-level approach except the IBM XL Compiler, which uses both. =In the presence of control flow= The presence of if-statements in the loop body requires the execution of instructions in all control paths to merge the multiple values of a variable. One general approach is to go through a sequence of code transformations: predication ‚Üí vectorization(using one of the above methods) ‚Üí remove vector predicates ‚Üí remove scalar predicates. If the following code is used as an example to show these transformations; for (i = 0; i < 1024; i++) if (A[i] > 0) C[i] = B[i]; else D[i] = D[i-1]; * After predication for (i = 0; i < 1024; i++) { P = A[i] > 0; NP = !P; C[i] = B[i]; (P) D[i] = D[i-1]; (NP) } where (P) denotes a predicate guarding the statement. * After vectorization for (i = 0; i < 1024; i+=4) { vP = A[i:i+3] > (0,0,0,0); vNP = vec_not(vP); C[i:i+3] = B[i:i+3]; (vP) (NP1,NP2,NP3,NP4) = vNP; D[i+3] = D[i+2]; (NP4) D[i+2] = D[i+1]; (NP3) D[i+1] = D[i]; (NP2) D[i] = D[i-1]; (NP1) } * After removing vector predicates for (i = 0; i < 1024; i+=4) { vP = A[i:i+3] > (0,0,0,0); vNP = vec_not(vP); C[i:i+3] = vec_sel(C[i:i+3],B[i:i+3],vP); (NP1,NP2,NP3,NP4) = vNP; D[i+3] = D[i+2]; (NP4) D[i+2] = D[i+1]; (NP3) D[i+1] = D[i]; (NP2) D[i] = D[i-1]; (NP1) } * After removing scalar predicates for (i = 0; i < 1024; i+=4) { vP = A[i:i+3] > (0,0,0,0); vNP = vec_not(vP); C[i:i+3] = vec_sel(C[i:i+3],B[i:i+3],vP); (NP1,NP2,NP3,NP4) = vNP; if (NP4) D[i+3] = D[i+2]; if (NP3) D[i+2] = D[i+1]; if (NP2) D[i+1] = D[i]; if (NP1) D[i] = D[i-1]; } =Reducing vectorization overhead in the presence of control flow= Having to execute the instructions in all control paths in vector code has been one of the major factors that slow down the vector code with respect to the scalar baseline. The more complex the control flow becomes and the more instructions are bypassed in the scalar code, the larger the vectorization overhead becomes. To reduce this vectorization overhead, vector branches can be inserted to bypass vector instructions similar to the way scalar branches bypass scalar instructions. Below, AltiVec predicates are used to show how this can be achieved. * Scalar baseline (original code) for (i = 0; i < 1024; i++) { if (A[i] > 0) { C[i] = B[i]; if (B[i] < 0) D[i] = E[i]; } } * After vectorization in the presence of control flow for (i = 0; i < 1024; i+=4) { vPA = A[i:i+3] > (0,0,0,0); C[i:i+3] = vec_sel(C[i:i+3],B[i:i+3],vPA); vT = B[i:i+3] < (0,0,0,0); vPB = vec_sel((0,0,0,0), vT, vPA); D[i:i+3] = vec_sel(D[i:i+3],E[i:i+3],vPB); } * After inserting vector branches for (i = 0; i < 1024; i+=4) if (vec_any_gt(A[i:i+3],(0,0,0,0))) { vPA = A[i:i+3] > (0,0,0,0); C[i:i+3] = vec_sel(C[i:i+3],B[i:i+3],vPA); vT = B[i:i+3] < (0,0,0,0); vPB = vec_sel((0,0,0,0), vT, vPA); if (vec_any_ne(vPB,(0,0,0,0))) D[i:i+3] = vec_sel(D[i:i+3],E[i:i+3],vPB); } There are two things to note in the final code with vector branches; First, the predicate defining instruction for vPA is also included within the body of the outer vector branch by using vec_any_gt. Second, the profitability of the inner vector branch for vPB depends on the conditional probability of vPB having false values in all fields given vPA has false values in all fields. Consider an example where the outer branch in the scalar baseline is always taken, bypassing most instructions in the loop body. The intermediate case above, without vector branches, executes all vector instructions. The final code, with vector branches, executes both the comparison and the branch in vector mode, potentially gaining performance over the scalar baseline.  Manual vectorization  In most C and C++ compilers, it is possible to use intrinsic functions to manually vectorise, at the expense of programmer effort and maintainability.

Introduction Geography is a children's game, which is good for a long car trip, where players take turns naming cities from anywhere in the world. Each city chosen must begin with the same letter that ended the previous city name. Repetition is not allowed. The game begins with an arbitrary starting city and ends when a player loses because he or she is unable to continue. =Graph model= To visualize the game, a directed graph can be constructed whose nodes are each cities of the world. An arrow is added from node N1 to node N2 if and only if the city labeling N2 starts with the letter that ending the name of the city labeling node N1. In other words, we draw an arrow from one city to another if the first can lead to the second according to the game rules. Each alternate edge in the directed graph corresponds to each player (for a two player game). The first player unable to extend the path loses. An illustration of the game (containing some cities in Michigan) is shown in the figure below. :Image:Generalized geography 1.svg In a generalized geography (GG) game, we replace the graph of city names with an arbitrary directed graph. The following graph is an example of a generalized geography game. :Image:Generalized geography 2.png =Playing the game= We define P1 as the player moving first and P2 as the player moving second and name the nodes N1 to Nn. In the above figure, P1 has a winning strategy as follows: N1 points only to nodes N2 and N3. Thus P1's first move must be one of these two choices. P1 chooses N2 (if P1 chooses N3, then P2 will choose N9 as that is the only option and P1 will lose). Next P2 chooses N4 because it is the only remaining choice. P1 now chooses N5 and P2 subsequently chooses N3 or N7. Regardless of P2's choice, P1 chooses N9 and P2 has no remaining choices and loses the game. Computational complexity The problem of determining which player has a winning strategy in a generalized geography game is PSPACE- complete. =Generalized geography is in PSPACE= Let GG = {  P1 has a winning strategy for the generalized geography game played on graph G starting at node b }; to show that GG ‚àà PSPACE, we present a polynomial-space recursive algorithm determining which player has a winning strategy. Given an instance of GG, start> where G is a directed graph and nstart is the designated start node, the algorithm M proceeds as follows: On M(start>): # Measure the out- degree of node nstart. If this degree is 0, then return , because there are no moves available for player one. # Construct a list of all nodes reachable from nstart by one edge: n1, n2, ..., ni. # Remove nstart and all edges connected to it from G to form G1. # For each node nj in the list n1, ..., ni, call M(1, nj>). # If all of these calls return accept, then no matter which decision P1 makes, P2 has a strategy to win, so return reject. Otherwise (if one of the calls returns reject) P1 has a choice that will deny any successful strategies for P2, so return accept. The algorithm M clearly decides GG. It is in PSPACE because the only non-obvious polynomial workspace consumed is in the recursion stack. The space consumed by the recursion stack is polynomial because each level of recursion adds a single node to the stack, and there are at most n levels, where n is the number of nodes in G. =Generalized geography is PSPACE-hard= The following proof is due to David Lichtenstein and Michael Sipser. To establish the PSPACE-hardness of GG, we can reduce the FORMULA-GAME problem (which is known to be PSPACE-hard) to GG in polynomial time (P). In brief, an instance of the FORMULA-GAME problem consists of a quantified Boolean formula œÜ = ‚àÉx1 ‚àÄx2 ‚àÉx3 ...Qxk(œà) where Q is either ‚àÉ or ‚àÄ. The game is played by two players, Pa and Pe, who alternate choosing values for successive xi. Pe wins the game if the formula œà ends up true, and Pa wins if œà ends up false. The formula œà is assumed to be in conjunctive normal form. In this proof, we assume that the quantifier list starts and ends with the existential qualifier, ‚àÉ, for simplicity. Note that any expression can be converted to this form by adding dummy variables that do not appear in œà. :Image:Generalized geography 3.png By constructing a graph G like the one shown above, we will show any instance of FORMULA-GAME can be reduced to an instance of Generalized Geography, where the optimal strategy for P1 is equivalent to that of Pe, and the optimal strategy for P2 is equivalent to that of Pa. The left vertical chain of nodes is designed to mimic the procedure of choosing values for variables in FORMULA-GAME. Each diamond structure corresponds to a quantified variable. Players take turns deciding paths at each branching node. Because we assumed the first quantifier would be existential, P1 goes first, selecting the left node if x1 is true and the right node if x1 is false. Each player must then take forced turns, and then P2 chooses a value for x2. These alternating assignments continue down the left side. After both players pass through all the diamonds, it is again P1 's turn, because we assumed that the last quantifier is existential. P1 has no choice but to follow the path to the right side of the graph. Then it is P2 's turn to make a move. When the play gets to the right side of the graph, it is similar to the end of play in the formula game. Recall that in the formula game, Pe wins if œà is true, while Pa wins if œà is false. The right side of the graph guarantees that P1 wins if and only if Pe wins, and that P2 wins if and only if Pa wins. First we show that P2 always wins when Pa wins. If Pa wins, œà is false. If œà is false, there exists an unsatisfying clause. P2 will choose an unsatisfying clause to win. Then when it is P1's turn he must choose a literal in that clause chosen by P2. Since all the literals in the clause are false, they do not connect to previously visited nodes in the left vertical chain. This allows P2 to follow the connection to the corresponding node in a diamond of the left chain and select it. However, P1 is now unable to select any adjacent nodes and loses. Now we show that P1 always wins when Pe wins. If Pe wins, œà is true. If œà is true, every clause in the right side of the graph contains a true literal. P2 can choose any clause. Then P1 chooses the literal that is true. And because it is true, its adjacent node in the left vertical node has already been selected, so P2 has no moves to make and loses. =Planar generalized geography is PSPACE-complete= Generalized geography is PSPACE-complete, even when played on planar graphs. The following proof is from theorem 3 of. Since planar GG is a special case of GG, and GG is in PSPACE, so planar GG is in PSPACE. It remains to show that planar GG is PSPACE-hard. This can be proved by showing how to convert an arbitrary graph into a planar graph, such that a game of GG played on this graph will have the same outcome as on the original graph. In order to do that, it's only necessary to eliminate all the edge crossings of the original graph. We draw the graph such that no three edges intersect at a point, and no pair of crossing edges can both be used in the same game. This is not possible in general, but is always possible for the graph constructed from a FORMULA-GAME instance; for example we could have only the edges from clause vertices involved in crossings. Now we replace each crossing with this construction: The intersection is eliminated by adding 6 vertices and redrawing the edges as shown. The result is a planar graph, and the same player can force a win as in the original graph: if a player chooses to move \\"up\\" from V in the transformed game, then both players must continuing moving \\"up\\" to W or lose immediately. So moving \\"up\\" from V in the transformed game simulates the move V‚ÜíW in the original game. If V‚ÜíW is a winning move, then moving \\"up\\" from V in the transformed game is also a winning move, and vice versa. Thus, the game of GG played on the transformed graph will have the same outcome as on the original graph. This transformation takes time that is a constant multiple to the number of edge intersections in the original graph, thus it takes polynomial time. Thus planar GG is PSPACE-complete. =Planar bipartite graph with maximum degree 3= GG played on planar bipartite graphs with maximum degree 3 is still PSPACE-complete, by replacing the vertices of degree higher than 3 with a chain of vertices with degree at most 3. Proof is in. Basically, frame Edge geography A variant of GG is called edge geography, where after each move, the edge that the player went through is erased. This is in contrast to the original GG, where after each move, the vertex that the player used to be on is erased. In this view, the original GG can be called Vertex Geography. Edge geography is PSPACE-complete. This is proved by reducing a decision problem of quantified Boolean formula to edge geography. Undirected geography One may also consider playing either Geography game on an undirected graph (that is, the edges can be traversed in both directions). Fraenkel, Scheinerman, and Ullman show that undirected vertex geography can be solved in polynomial time, whereas undirected edge geography is PSPACE- complete, even for planar graphs with maximum degree 3. If the graph is bipartite, then Undirected Edge Geography is solvable in polynomial time. Consequences Given that GG is PSPACE-complete, no polynomial time algorithm exists for optimal play in GG unless P = PSPACE. However, it may not be as easy to prove the complexity of other games because certain games (such as chess) contain a finite number of game positions -- making it hard (or impossible) to formulate a mapping to a PSPACE-complete problem. In spite of this, the complexity of certain games can still be analyzed by generalization (e.g., to an n √ó n board). See the references for a proof for generalized Go, as a corollary of the proof of the completeness of GG.

Its primary function serves as a boneyard for civilian commercial aircraft, where the area's dry desert climate mitigates corrosion of the aircraft. It is the largest commercial aircraft storage and heavy maintenance facility in the world. Even so, many aircraft which are brought here wind up being scrapped. Nearby the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base provides the same service to the United States Federal Government. Aircraft at Pinal Airpark include those formerly operated by Cathay Dragon, Cathay Pacific, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, Aerosur, Hellenic, Surinam Airways, and other carriers. History 1945 Phoenix Sectional Chart showing Marana Army Air Field and Marana Auxiliary Army Airfield No. 2, No. 4, No. 5 Built in 1942 by the Sundt and Del Webb Construction Companies and opened in March 1943, the facility was known as Marana Army Air Field. During World War II, the airfield was under the command of the 389th Army Air Force Base Unit, AAF West Coast Training Center and used as a training base, as part of the 50,000 Pilot Training Program. Marana conducted basic flight training and the training of transport pilots in instrument flying and navigation, being the home of the 3024th (Pilot School, Basic). Chinese pilots were also trained there. Five satellite airfields were established for Marana during World War II: *Picacho Field Aux #1 (currently Picacho Stagefield ARNG Heliport ) *Rillito Field Aux #2 (currently reused as Marana Regional Airport ) *Coronado Field Aux #3 *Avra Field Aux #4 *Sahuaro Field Aux #5 (currently El Tiro Gliderport ) The infrastructure installed at Marana during World War II was extensive. This included water, sewer, and gas systems that were still used until some problems developed in the 1990s. There was also a massive storm drain system. The airfield also had a railroad spur line and railroad station. Marana was closed after World War II and in 1948, after the establishment of the U.S. Air Force as an independent service, Pinal County accepted a deed to the property, subsequent to the Air Force's disposal of most of the buildings, waterlines, gas lines, and electrical lines. From 1948 to 1951, Pinal County leased the property to multiple tenants, and from 1951 to 1956, Marana was reused as a contractor-operated USAF basic flying school, operated by Darr Aeronautical Technical Company. Marana became the headquarters of all Central Intelligence Agency air operations during the Vietnam War years, when it was the primary facility of Intermountain Airlines, a wholly owned CIA \\"front\\" company which was used to supply covert operations in Southeast Asia and elsewhere. Intermountain was infamous for its thinly veiled CIA special ops which included development and use of the Fulton Skyhook, but its cover was its non-scheduled freight and maintenance operations. Marana was the principal continental United States maintenance base for Southeast Asia CIA operations including Air America and Continental Air Services. The Marana facility was subsequently acquired by Evergreen International Airlines which performed aircraft modification and maintenance at the airfield. One of the more notable aircraft assigned to Marana during its CIA years was a Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress, AAF Serial 44-85531. 531 was registered September 1957 to Western Enterprises, Inc. of Taiwan (founded by the CIA in 1951). In late 1957 missions were staged from Kurmitola Air Field in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) to parachute agents into Tibet. The aircraft was disassembled for parts at Clark Air Base, Philippines between March and October 1958, and it is believed that this plane was eventually scrapped. The serial number 44-85531 appeared again as registered on another B-17G, 1 September 1960 registered to Atlantic General Enterprise, Washington DC (another CIA front) as N809Z. These registration numbers were then changed to the true numbers of 44-83785. Based again at Marana, this aircraft later flew black operations over Vietnam and was used to retrieve two American agents from an abandoned Soviet scientific base in the Arctic using the Fulton Skyhook in Operation Coldfeet.

Life Born in Brian√ßon, the son and grandson of physicians, he was educated in Paris (Coll√®ge de Navarre) and obtained a degree in medicine in 1522. He was imprisoned in 1524, probably for practicing judicial astrology. In 1531, he was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the Coll√®ge Royal (the present Coll√®ge de France), founded by King Francis I, where he taught until his death.Isabelle Pantin, 'Oronce Fine's Role as Royal Lecturer', in Alexander Marr (ed.), 'The Worlds of Oronce Fine: Mathematics, Instruments and Print in Renaissance France' (Shaun Tyas, 2009), pp. 13‚Äì30. Mathematics Quadratura circuli, 1544 Although primarily a populariser, Fin√© was one of the most prolific authors of mathematical books of his age. He worked in a wide range of mathematical fields, including practical geometry, arithmetic, optics, gnomonics, astronomy and instrumentalism.Alexander Marr, 'Introduction', in Alexander Marr (ed.), 'The Worlds of Oronce Fine: Mathematics, Instruments and Print in Renaissance France' (Shaun Tyas, 2009), pp. 1‚Äì12 He gave the value of pi (‚âà 3.14159) to be ‚âà 3.1746 in 1544. Later, he gave ‚âà 3.1333 and, in De rebus mathematicis (1556), he gave ‚âà 3.1410. Astronomy and geography In 1542 Fin√© published De mundi sphaera (On the Heavenly Spheres), a popular astronomy textbook whose woodcut illustrations were much appreciated.Adam Mosley, 'Early Modern Cosmography: Fine's Sphaera mundi in Content and Context', in Alexander Marr (ed.), 'The Worlds of Oronce Fine: Mathematics, Instruments and Print in Renaissance France' (Shaun Tyas, 2009), pp. 114‚Äì136. His writing on astronomy included guides to the use of astronomical equipment and methods (e.g. the ancient practice of determining longitude through the coordinated observation of lunar eclipses from two fixed points with enough distance between them to make the phenomena appear at different times of the night). He also described more recent innovations, such as an instrument he called a m√©th√©oroscope (an astrolabe modified by adding a compass). Explanatory work was complemented by direct contributions. His woodcut map of France (1525) is one of the first of its kind. He constructed an ivory sundial in 1524, which still exists.Catherine Eagleton, 'Oronce Fine's Sundials: The Sources and Influences of De solaribus horologiis', in Alexander Marr (ed.), 'The Worlds of Oronce Fine: Mathematics, Instruments and Print in Renaissance France' (Shaun Tyas, 2009), pp. 83‚Äì99 Heart-shaped map Fin√©'s heart-shaped (cordiform) map projection may be his most famous illustration, and was frequently employed by other notable cartographers, including Peter Apian and Gerardus Mercator.Jean-Jacques Brioist, 'Oronce Fine and Cartographical Methods', in Alexander Marr (ed.), 'The Worlds of Oronce Fine: Mathematics, Instruments and Print in Renaissance France' (Shaun Tyas, 2009), pp. 137‚Äì155. Fin√© attempted to reconcile discoveries in the New World with old medieval legends and information (derived from Ptolemy) regarding the Orient. Thus, on one of his two world maps, Nova Universi Orbis Descriptio (1531), the legend marked Asia covers both North America and Asia, which were represented as one landmass. He used the toponym \\"America\\" for South America, and thus Marco Polo's Mangi, Tangut and Catay appear on the shores of the present-day Gulf of Mexico. On the same map, Fin√© drew Terra Australis to the south, including the legend \\"recently discovered but not yet completely explored\\", by which he meant the discovery of Tierra del Fuego by Ferdinand Magellan.Robert J. King, \\"Terra Australis Not Yet Known\\", National Library of Australia, Mapping our World: Terra Incognita to Australia, Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2013, p. 82. ]. Image at Rare Maps from the State Library of New South Wales] and at: Fin√©'s cosmography was derived from the German mathematician and cosmographer Johannes Sch√∂ner.Henry Harrisse, The Discovery of North America, London, 1892 (reprinted Amsterdam, N. Israel, 1961), p. 583. In his study of Sch√∂ner's globes, Franz von Wieser, found that the derivation of Fin√©'s mappemonde from them was \\"unmistakeable (unverkennbar)\\"; he said \\"Orontius Finaeus took from Sch√∂ner not only the Brasilie Regio, but the whole Austral Continent, the Strait of Magellan, and above all the whole arrangement of lands; in a word, the mappemonde of Oronce Fin√© is a copy of Sch√∂ner's\\".Franz von Wieser, Magalh√£es-Strasse und Austral-Continent. Auf den Globen Johannes Sch√∂ner. Beitrage zur Geschichte der Erdkunde im xvi. Jahrhundert, Innsbruck, 1881 (reprinted Amsterdam, Meridian, 1967), pp. 67, 79‚Äì80. Lucien Gallois also noted the undeniable ressemblance parfaite between Fin√©'s 1531 mappemonde and Sch√∂ner's globe of 1533.Lucien Gallois, Les G√©ographes allemands de la Renaissance, Paris, Leroux, 1890 (repr. Amsterdam, Meridian, 1963), p. 92. As Sch√∂ner's globe of 1523, which also closely resembled Fin√©'s mappemonde, was not identified until 1925 by Frederik (F.C.) Wieder, Gallois was forced to argue that Fin√©, who said he had been working on his mappemonde since 1521, had had direct or indirect personal communication with Sch√∂ner or had drawn upon his 1515 Luculentissima descriptio. Wieder's identification of Sch√∂ner's map gores of 1523 strengthens Gallois' case for Fin√©'s reliance upon Sch√∂ner.F. C. Wieder (ed.), Monumenta Cartographica, The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff, 1925, Vol. I, pp. 1‚Äì4, \\"The Globe of Johannes Sch√∂ner, 1523‚Äì1524\\", and Plates 1‚Äì3. Fine's 1536 world map bore a dedicatory inscription in the lower left corner, which stated: > ABOUT FIFTEEN years since, Dear Reader, we first designed, in the shape of a > human heart, this universal map of the world, in gratitude to the Most > Christian and Most Mighty Francis, King of the French, our most clement > Maecenas. For while we saw the King, a Polymath, and uncommon Geographer, > greatly pleased by all and praised by many, even in foreign countries, I > wanted finally to communicate the same description of the whole globe to all > students of Mathematics: which, after variations in fortune and crises in > the studies we pursued, which up to now have been a hindrance to us, we have > finally done at our own risk.

The same map bore another inscription in the lower right corner, which explained how to use the map to accurately measure the distances between places shown on it: > From the description of the world in this map, for any two locations of > which the longitudes and latitudes are given (but not exceeding ninety > degrees), close to the true direct distance between them can be calculated. > Having thus reckoned the longitudes and latitudes of the places, their > places in the chart being selected at the same time, place one foot of the > compasses over the other places, and extend the other over the rest.

Oronce Fine 1536 Annotatio Death and legacy Fin√© died in Paris at age 60. Jean Clouet is said to have painted a portrait of Fin√© in 1530, when Fin√© was 36. With the original painting lost, the rendering is now known only through prints derived from the original image. Honours The lunar crater Orontius and Finaeus Cove in Antarctica are named after Oronce Fin√©, using his Latinized name. In 2014, a square named after Oronce Fine was inaugurated in Paris, France.

She had a number of hits with Larry Clinton and his Orchestra. After her marriage she and her husband became involved in radio, helming a show titled \\"Mr. and Mrs. Music\\". Career On a 1937 recording with Artie Shaw, she was credited as Beatrice Wayne, which led some to assume that was her real name. On record labels, her name was shortened (without her permission) to \\"Bea\\" by the record company, ostensibly for space considerations. As she explained, \\"They cut it to 'Bea' Wain. They cut the 'Beatrice' out to 'Bea.' I was just a little old girl singer, but that's the truth. So that's how my name became 'Bea Wain'\\". She led the vocal group Bea and the Bachelors (with Al Rinker, Ken Lane, and John Smedberg) and the V8 (seven boys and a girl) on the Fred Waring show. In 1937, Wain joined former Tommy Dorsey arranger Larry Clinton and His Orchestra, which she joined after doing chorus work with Fred Waring and Ted Sttraeter. Her debut with Clinton was made in the summer of 1938 at the Glen Island Casino, New Rochelle, New York.Billboard, January 24, 1942 =Radio= Wain made her debut on radio at age six as a \\"featured performer\\" on the NBC Children's Hour. As an adult, she sang regularly on The Larry Clinton Show (NBC 1938), Monday Merry-Go-Round (NBC Blue 1941-1942), Starlight Serenade (Mutual 1944), and Your Hit Parade. =Recordings= My Reverie (Victor 26006) stayed at the top of the chart for eight weeks in 1938. Wain was also the first artist to record the Harold Arlen-Yip Harburg classic \\"Over the Rainbow\\" (on December 7, 1938, with Clinton's orchestra), but MGM prohibited the release until The Wizard of Oz (1939) had opened and audiences heard Judy Garland perform it. Wain rarely made recordings after she left the Clinton orchestra in 1939, focusing primarily on her work on radio instead. Mr. and Mrs. Music Following her musical career, Wain worked with Baruch as a husband-and-wife disc jockey team in New York on WMCA, where they were billed as \\"Mr. and Mrs. Music\\". An article in the May 1945 issue of Radio Best magazine noted, \\"In the trade she is looked upon as an accurate picker of hits and is a favorite song plugger of tunesmiths like Cole Porter, Johnny Mercer, Harold Arlen and Harry Warren.\\" In 1973, the couple moved to Palm Beach, Florida, where for nine years they had a top-rated daily four-hour talk show from 2 p.m. - 6 p.m. on WPBR before relocating to Beverly Hills. During the early 1980s, the pair hosted a syndicated version of Your Hit Parade. In a 2004 interview with Christopher Popa, Wain reflected: \\"Actually, I've had a wonderful life, a wonderful career. And I'm still singing, and I'm still singing pretty good. This past December, I did a series of shows in Palm Springs, California, and the review said, \\"Bea Wain is still a giant.\\" It's something called Musical Chairs. I did six shows in six different venues, and I was a smash. And I really got a kick out of it.\\"Popa, Christopher.\\"Larry Clinton, True Confession\\", bigbandlibrary.com; accessed March 16, 2015.

For Wyman as collector: various web references attest to the presence of his artifacts in museums today; see e.g., He lived in Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Wyman was quite wealthy; the Chicago Tribune remarks that the couple \\"made their home in the Edwin E. Brown mansion, and maintained there a lavish establishment of servants, horses, and carriages.\\" They were prominent in Evanston social circles. The Wymans had three children, all daughters: Florence (born 25 January 1881), Caroline (born 28 August 1882), and the youngest Loraine (born 23 October 1885 in Evanston).See Wilson (1900:72). Wyman's childhood was not always serene. After 1891, her parents lived separately, with Julie taking Loraine and Florence to Paris to live, leaving Caroline with the father.For Paris see Stamler (2002:207); for allocation of children see Chicago Tribune, \\"Wyman children restored to papa\\", 20 December 1896. In 1896 Walter Wyman obtained a divorce from his wife on grounds of adultery (he also charged her with addiction to alcohol). As part of the divorce proceedings Wyman successfully obtained custody of all three of his daughters, who joined him in Evanston.Chicago Tribune, 20 December 1896. Following this there were two occasions in which the daughters fled from their father, attempting to join their mother.\\"Three girls missing: daughters of Walter C. Wyman mysteriously disappear\\", Chicago Tribune, 13 March 1897, at . Julie Wyman's brother was arrested for helping them in the first of their escape attempts, and for a time after this they were placed under police watch.Chicago Tribune, \\"Catcher Moran in a box: arrested on a charge of abducting his sister's daughter\\", 18 December 1896. For Moran, see Bill Moran (catcher). The charges against Moran were dropped in return for relinquishing the children (19 December 1896); instead a warrant was issued for the hiding mother. See Chicago Tribune, \\"Wyman children restored to papa,\\" 20 December 1896. The Chicago Tribune later described how the mother and daughters made their final escape via New York (March 1897): they were \\"taken aboard of an outgoing French steamer by a launch which was in waiting in the North [i.e. Hudson] river. Thus she eluded detectives employed by her husband.\\"Anonymous (1907)The escape perhaps did not end the travails of the mother and children, if isolated newspaper reports are to be believed. The Milwaukee Sentinel reported on 2 July 1898 that various \\"eminent artists in New York have made an appeal for donations to the three destitute children of Mrs. Julie Wyman, who is said to be penniless and hopelessly ill.\\" A variety of newspapers, all in the West, carried a report in 1898 that Julie Wyman had gone insane and have been placed in an asylum in New York. Having relocated her children to Paris,The Chicago Tribune later reported that the daughters had been placed in a convent; Anonymous (1907). Julie Wyman fairly soon returned to North America, where she settled in Toronto and resumed her singing career; between 1898 and 1904 performances by her are recorded in Toronto, New York, Buffalo, Boston, and Cleveland. She eventually moved to Philadelphia. Julie Wyman died a suicide in 1907 in the apartment of her daughter Caroline in New York; Loraine and her older sister Florence were still living in Paris at the time. =Musical training= Yvette Guilbert Amid all this disruption, Loraine Wyman grew to adulthood, mostly in Paris. She learned the French language and developed a sense of connection to France and its people‚Äîmanifested in her later fundraising efforts during the First World War (see below). She also took up singing, and is reported by one source to have studied with Blanche Marchesi,Rhode Island Archive and Manuscripts Collection Online, Loraine Wyman collection, Biographical Note. On line at who had earlier taught her mother. More important were her studies with the celebrated cabaret singer Yvette Guilbert, from whom (Stamler) \\"she acquired a taste for French and British folksongs.\\" The French-Canadian folklore specialist Marius Barbeau later asserted that her French training was fundamental to Wyman's artistic approach. > Miss Loraine Wyman makes us realize to what extent a rustic melody can be > transformed by art while still preserving its original contour. Although > American by birth, Miss Wyman is a representative of French style and taste. > The discrimination, finesse, and sincerity of her interpretations relies > especially on the tradition founded by Gaston Paris and Julien Tiersot and > broadened by Yvette Guilbert, of whom she was a pupil.Barbeau (1920). The > original French reads, \\"Miss Loraine Wyman nous fera saisir jusqu‚Äô√† quel > point l‚Äôart peut m√©tamorphoser une m√©lodie rustique tout en conservant son > contour original. Bien qu‚ÄôAm√©ricaine de naissance, Miss Wyman repr√©sente ici > le style et le go√ªt fran√ßais.

Vogue reports her taking the part of an Ancient Greek singer in a pageant (27 May 1909). Probably around this time she studied with a leading New York voice teacher, Frida Ashforth.Saerchinger (1919). This source specifies Ashforth as Wyman's teacher but does not say when. James Huneker called Ashforth the \\"doyenne of vocal teachers\\"; New York Times, 2 February 1919. By the following year, she had embarked on a concert career, in which she sang a mixture of folksongs of various origin to urban audiences. Stamler writes, > She became a popular touring concert artist, performing French and British > songs in peasant costume and charming audiences and critics across the > country.A collection of very positive reviews is given at the Iowa Digital > Library at , which includes the Boston Transcript review quoted below. In > 1914, the New York Times reported that she had achieved critical success as > a performer in London, and in January 1916 she stood in for an ailing > Guilbert at the Metropolitan Opera, to rave notices. A reviewer for the Boston Transcript wrote: > Her voice, a light one, but of fine, agreeable quality and carrying power, > has been carefully trained and is expressive. ‚Äî Her diction is excellent. > She has the great gift of humor. In her interpretation naive, pathetic or > malicious songs, facial expression and significant gestures add to the > effect of her well modulated voice. ‚Äî There is no extravagance in her > performance; she does not go too far; she knows when she has made her points > and is willing to give her hearers credit for a certain amount of > intelligence. Smith (2003), reviewing the press accounts, concludes that Wyman consistently delighted her audiences and critics. For example, one review (Rochester Post Express, 13 November 1912) said: > Miss Loraine Wyman gave a costume ballade recital last night before the > members of the Alliance Francaise and their friends ... It is doubtful if > the audience, no matter what the musical experience of its individuals may > have been, has received more enjoyment than was given with a liberal hand by > this young songster last night.Quoted from Smith and MacNeil (2003:29) =Performances before 1916= The Th√©√¢tre du Gymnase in 1910 Loraine Wyman in performance costume (here: Breton peasant attire), as portrayed some time in the mid 1910s by her friendAccording to Heilbrun et al.

Wyman's New York debut was in January 1910.The performance was announced by the New York Times (2 January 1910): \\"Miss Loraine Wyman will give a song recital in Aeolian Hall on Saturday evening, Jan. 15. She will be assisted by Miss Lillian Littlehales, 'cellist, and Mrs. Edith Longstreet Smith, pianist.\\" Later that year, she left for Europe, performing with her mentor Yvette Guilbert at the Th√©√¢tre du Gymnase in Paris in November, 1910, and again at Bechstein Hall (now Wigmore Hall) in London in June 1911.For debut and European performances, see Saerchinger (1918:708‚Äì709) In 1912, Wyman performed at the Women's Musical Club in Toronto, where her mother had appeared twelve years earlier.Feuerriegel, Hanna and Fred Feurriegel (2016) History of concerts and performers of the Women's Musical Club of Toronto, 3rd ed. Toronto: Women‚Äôs Musical Club of Toronto. Available on line: . By 1913 she was well enough known to be invited to perform at the White House before President Taft and the assembled members of the Supreme Court.\\"Mr. and Mrs. Taft hosts to the Supreme Court\\", Washington Post 22 January 1913. In 1914, she performed in London and Paris, taking the opportunity to research more folk song material in \\"old monasteries and libraries\\" there.\\"Will offer folk songs of France; visitor is to give unique recital Monday at the Huntington\\", Los Angeles Times 2 March 1915. Later that year, she went to perform in Chicago and Evanston, where she had not been since her childhood; a number of performances were in homes of old family friends.See Chicago Tribune, \\"Society and entertainments\\", 22 April 1924, p. 14. The long absence was pointed out by the Tribune society columnist, who fondly recalled her mother's performances (issue of 8 February 1914, on line at ). The Evanston performance is recorded on the Iowa Digital Library site at . In 1915 Wyman crossed the continent for performances in the Los Angeles area.The Los Angeles Times on 15 February 1915 announced a concert at the Friday Morning Club, and later on 2 March at the Huntington Library. She also performed at the palatial home of Frederick Forrest Peabody in Montecito; see . =Appalachian fieldwork= The early stages of Wyman's performing career coincided with a widespread awakening of interest in the folk songs of the southern Appalachian mountains, where the local population‚Äîat the time quite geographically isolated‚Äîhad conserved and evolved a centuries-long heritage of melody and lyrics by oral transmission across generations. Already, several state folklore societies had formed to collect and record these songs, and Olive Dame Campbell had gathered (though not published) a fairly extensive body of material.For discussion of this early stage of collection, see Filene (2000:15‚Äì20). Previously, Wyman had sung on stage only folksongs gathered by others, mostly French and British, and it is only natural that she would develop an interest in field work in such a fertile territory, fieldwork whose results would permit her to expand her performing repertoire with American material. Thus in 1916 Wyman undertook, with her accompanist the composer Howard Brockway, a six-week journey through the Cumberland Mountains to collect Appalachian folk songs. A contemporary reviewer described the work as follows: > Attracted to the songs by a study of their purely literary aspects as > published some time ago by Professor Bradley,According to Shapiro, this > refers to the article Henry Aspinwall Bradley (1915) Song-ballets and > devil's ditties.

Greene, who examined Zande's preserved correspondence, writes: \\"Wyman was a charismatic sort of person who held Zande (who had met her earlier in New York) enthralled. When Lonesome Tunes, as Wyman called her collection, [see below] premiered in New York, ... Zande made a special trip just to be there. She found great pleasure in having \\"their\\" songs shared with the outside world, and by a team as talented as Wyman and Brockway.\\" See Greene (1982:177). They also worked at the Hindman Settlement School, and ultimately journeyed through seven counties of eastern Kentucky: Knott, Harlan, Letcher, Estill, Pulaski, Magoffin, and Jackson.Source for this paragraph: Whisnant (1995: 55‚Äì56). Concerning the delicate task of persuading the inhabitants to share their songs, Wyman wrote: > The [inhabitants] seldom responded readily to our requests ... If they did > not refuse pointblank, they would plead a cold or hoarseness as an excuse > for not singing at once. The ruse actually worked with me for a while, but I > presently came to see through it and continued to ply my arguments and > pleadings. Often it was necessary to sing for them first.

The creator of the cover artwork is unidentified but the style suggests Wyman's sister Florence Wyman Ivins; see On returning to their base in New York, Wyman and Brockway began to perform on stage the songs they had gathered, using piano accompaniments composed by Brockway. They premiered their renditions of Appalachian song at the Cort Theater in New York in October 1916,The New York Times (30 October 1916, p. 3) gave the concert a very positive review and reported that the audiences was \\"large, very interested, and applauded much\\". and per Stamler, \\"continu[ed] for the next decade to uniformly enthusiastic reviews.\\" They also published selected songs from their fieldwork, along with Brockway's piano accompaniments, in two collections: *Lonesome Tunes: Folk Songs from the Kentucky Mountains (1916) New York: H. W. Gray. *Twenty Kentucky Mountain Songs (1920) Boston: Oliver Ditson & Co.. Sales figures of these volumes are apparently not available, but Stamler, noting their widespread appearance in library catalogs, infers that they sold well. Lonesome Tunes was reissued by its publisher in 1944, 28 years after initial publication.See entry at WorldCat: . The two volumes just mentioned were intended for domestic use and enjoyment, rather than specifically being contributions to the scholarly literature on folk song. Wyman later shared a large amount of her Appalachian material with the doyen of American folk song scholars, George Lyman Kittredge, who published some of it (properly acknowledging Wyman) in a 1917 scholarly article.George Lyman Kittredge (1917) Ballads and songs. Journal of American Folklore Vol. 30, No. 117 (Jul. ‚Äì Sep., 1917), pp. 283‚Äì369. As her career continued to flourish Wyman made efforts to \\"give back\\" (as we would say today) to the Appalachian community. In 1917 she returned to Chicago to sing Appalachian folk songs in a benefit concertChicago Tribune, 16 February 1917, p. 11 for the Hindman Settlement School, and served on the Advisory Board of the Pine Mountain Settlement School.See . =The Appalachian dulcimer= Wyman in Vogue 1917, holding an Appalachian dulcimer. The Vogue article covered several artists, with the theme \\"the past musical season has been one to encourage the artist who desires to develop his individuality rather than to emulate genius.\\"Hiram Kelly Moderwell (1907) \\"Makers of music\\", Vogue, 1 May 1907, p. 79. At some point, probably on her fieldwork visit to Kentucky, Wyman bought an Appalachian dulcimer,Mercer (1926:494) indicates that Wyman obtained her instrument in Kentucky in 1915, which would be a year before the fieldwork took place; no other sources have been found suggesting that Wyman visited Kentucky in 1915. Another puzzle is that Seeger (1958:47), describing Wyman's instrument, says that according to Seeger the \\"MS label on back of lower right sound hole reads: \\"Manufactured by J. E. Thomas Jan. 25 1918 Bath Ky.\\"; this places the instrument two years too late, rather than one year too early, to have been collected during the Kentucky field trip. Perhaps misprints are present in the sources. which she demonstrated at the 1916 concert premiering the songs from the Kentucky fieldwork.See the review in The Musical Leader, Vol. 36, at . This may have been the instrument that was depicted in the photograph of Wyman seen at right, which appeared in Vogue magazine on 1 May 1917. Wyman's dulcimer was the work of J. Edward Thomas (1850‚Äì1933), the leading builder of the time.Smith and MacNeil (2003:7) According to Maud Karpeles, who did fieldwork in the Appalachians around the same time as Wyman, the Appalachian dulcimer was confined to Kentucky at the time and not widely distributed even there.Seeger, Charles (1958) The Appalachian Dulcimer. Journal of American Folklore Vol. 71, No. 279 (Jan. ‚Äì Mar., 1958), pp. 40‚Äì51 It likewise seems not to have been an essential aspect of Wyman's own performances.It is not widely reported in newspaper reviews, and may have been a one-off item, performed at the premiere of the Kentucky songs. Musical America reported: \\"Miss Wyman confessed that playing the instrument was for her as difficult as the well- known \\"stunt\\" of patting the head with one's hand while the other rubs the diaphragm and vice versa. Despite this, she played \\"Yankee Doodle\\" so that one could actually recognize it.\\" Source: Musical America, 11 November 1916, p. 25. Available on line at Google Books: . Seeger notes that it is a low-volume instrument, more suited to home than public use.\\"The dulcimer is for the individual or the intimate group, not for the crowd\\"; Seeger (1977:43).

In the first half of the 1920s Wyman frequently appeared on concert programs with the early music specialist, harpsichordist, and pedagogue Arthur Whiting, usually in college and university settings.Harvard: ; Princeton: ; University of Albany (now so named): ; Vassar: , Pennsylvania State University: . Wyman herself owned a harpsichord, a 1921 model built by the Gaveau firm in France.Deredita (2007) She served for a time (ca. 1922‚Äì1923) on the faculty of the Mannes School of Music as a teacher of English and French diction; Howard Brockway was also teaching there in the piano department.See catalog for 1922‚Äì1923: . A review of one of her performances in 1924 by Olin Downes in the New York Times praised her as \\"an excellent musician\\" but also reported her as being \\"not in good vocal condition\\".New York Times, 31 March 1924 No further New York performances, it appears, were subsequently reported in the Times. Her last public performances for which documentation survives took place in 1925. On 14 July 1926,See Bastille Day. Wyman married a wealthy obstetrician and medical school professor named Henry McMahon Painter (12 July 1863 ‚Äì 11 March 1934), whose patients include members of prominent New York families. According to Minton, Wyman and Painter had been lovers for many years; earlier in 1926 Painter had obtained a divorce from his wife.For the relationship of Wyman and Painter and its consequences for his family, see Minton (2002:124), as well as the memoirs of Painter's son Thomas (pseudonymized as \\"Will G\\") in Henry (1948). Further details concerning Painter (including the date of his marriage to Wyman) are given in the obituary compiled for him at Yale University (on line at ). Painter retired from medicine in 1928; Wyman moved with him to France, where they lived in Grez-sur-Loing, an artist-colony village not far from Paris. They later returned to New York, where Painter died in 1934.Further information on Painter appears in his New York Times obituary, 12 March 1934. With her marriage Wyman disappeared entirely from public life.Despite the abundance of press reports from earlier years, no information at all seems to be available from newspaper articles for the part of her life coming after 1925. She died in New York 11 September 1937, aged 51.Stamler (2012). A death notice, without obituary, appeared in the New York Times, 13 September 1937. It reports that Wyman died in Doctor's Hospital in New York and announces a funeral at St. George's Church in Stuyvesant Square Scholarly legacy Portrait of Loraine Wyman in French costume by her sister Florence Wyman Ivins Loraine Wyman left a substantial scholarly library, \\"an extensive collection of books about folk music and folklore mostly of the British Isles, the United States and France.\\" On her death the collection, along with other materials, passed to her older sister Florence Wyman Ivins, who in the meantime had become a well-known artist.She was the first female artist to have a solo exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; see . The elder sister donated these materials to Connecticut College in 1948. The scholarly books remain in the Special Collections of the Connecticut College Library. Loraine Wyman's field notes and other papers were transferred in 2004 to an archive at Brown University, where they reside today. Her Gaveau harpsichord was transferred to the Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments.Source for all of the preceding: Deredita (2007).

The two published accounts of her life (Lee and McNeil 2001 and Stamler 2012) are both brief and incomplete, and the flurry of interest in the 1910s in Appalachian folk music which she helped create is little remembered; nowadays when one speaks of a \\"folk revival\\" in America, this is taken to mean the later period of interest in the 1940s through 1960s, going from Pete Seeger to Bob Dylan (for details see Roots revival). Wyman's Appalachian field work with Brockway was outshone by the far more comprehensive study of Cecil Sharp and Maud Karpeles, begun almost exactly at the moment Wyman and Brockway left Kentucky.The Sharp/Karpeles materials were first published in a 1917 sketch volume, covering only the material gathered in their first summer, then after Sharp's death in 1932 in a massive scholarly volume edited by Karpeles from field notes from all three summers of fieldwork from 1916‚Äì1918; for details see Cecil Sharp. Wyman and Brockway's Appalachian volumes were later denigrated by the folk song scholar D. K. Wilgus, who complained that the texts had been altered and the singers of individual songs not identified.D. K. Wilgus (1959) Anglo-American Folksong Scholarship Since 1898. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, pp. 168‚Äì169. Nevertheless, Wyman's work was and is appreciated by various individuals. The Australian composer-pianist Percy Grainger, who had a strong interest in folk music and did field work on folk songs himself, performed the Wyman-Brockway settings in public, and noted a kind of emotional connection to the published volumes: he performed the songs in Lonesome Tunes at home with his mother (taking the vocal part on a saxophone or sarrusophone), and said of the book after her death, \\"in other ways, also, a most sacred relic to me\\".Clifford, Phil (1983) Grainger's collection of music by other composers.

History These echoes were first observed in 1927 by civil engineer and amateur radio operator J√∏rgen Hals from his home near Oslo, Norway. Hals had repeatedly observed an unexpected second radio echo with a significant time delay after the primary radio echo ended. Unable to account for this strange phenomenon, he wrote a letter to Norwegian physicist Carl St√∏rmer, explaining the event: > At the end of the summer of 1927 I repeatedly heard signals from the Dutch > short-wave transmitting station PCJJ at Eindhoven. At the same time as I > heard these I also heard echoes. I heard the usual echo which goes round the > Earth with an interval of about 1/7 of a second as well as a weaker echo > about three seconds after the principal echo had gone.

V. Grassmann, Long-delayed radio echoes, Observations and interpretations, VHF Communications, vol. 2, pp. 109-116, 1993. Long delayed echoes have been heard sporadically from the first observations in 1927 and up to the present day. Five hypotheses Shlionskiy lists 15 possible natural explanations in two groups: reflections in outer space, and reflections within the Earth's magnetosphere.Sverre Holm summary, Shlionskiy's 15 possible explanations for Long Delayed EchoesA. G. Shlionskiy, \\"Radio echos with multisecond delays,\\" Telecommunications. and Radio Engineering, Vol 44, No. 12, pp. 48‚Äì51, December 1989.

Crawford, \\"Long-delayed radio echoes: Mechanisms and observations,\\" Journal of Geophysical Research, vol. 90, no. A2, pp. 1523‚Äì1530, February 1985. Sverre Holm, professor of signal processing at the University of Oslo details those five;Sverre Holm, The Five Most Likely Explanations for Long Delayed Echoes in summary, * Ducting in the Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere at low HF frequencies (1‚Äì4 MHz).Sverre Holm, Unusual HF Propagation Phenomena - MDE Some similarities with whistlers. :Signals may pass the ionosphere and then be conducted in the magnetosphere out to a distance of several earth radii over to the opposite hemisphere where they will be reflected on top of the ionosphere. The round-trip time varies with the geomagnetic latitude of the transmitter and is typically in the 140‚Äì300 ms range. The further north the station, the larger the delay. Due to the short delay, this cannot be considered to be a real long-delayed echo. For completeness it is still included here. Radio waves of frequency less than about 7 MHz can become trapped in magnetic field-aligned ionization ducts with L values (distance from the center of the earth to the field line at the magnetic equator) less than about 4. These waves after being trapped can propagate to the opposite hemisphere where they become reflected in the topside ionosphere. They can return along the duct, leave it, and propagate to the receiver.[Muldrew, D. B., Generation of long delay echoes, Journal of Geophysical Research, 84, 5199‚Äì5215, 1979; Villard Jr., G. O. (W6QYT), D. B. Muldrew and F. W. Waxham (K7DS), The magnetospheric echo box -- a type of long-delayed echo explained, QST, 11-14, October, 1980] * Travel many times around the world. Signals can travel around the Earth seven times in one second. Such signals are also not uncommon. :\\"Goodacre A. K. Goodacre (VE3HX), \\"Observations of long-delayed echoes on 28 MHz,\\" QST, March 1980, pp. 14‚Äì16.A. K. Goodacre (VE3HX), \\"Some observations of long-delay wireless echoes on the 28-MHz amateur band,\\" Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 85, No. A5, pp. 2329‚Äì2334, May 1980. reports that he pointed his antenna towards the horizon and received his own 28 MHz signal delayed by up to about 9 seconds.... His measurement implies travel up to 65 rounds around the earth.\\" Probably the upper frequency limit for such effects. :The most popular current theory is that the radio signals are trapped between two ionized layers in the atmosphere and then are guided around the world many times over until they fall out of a gap in the bottom layer. (Ducting propagation between air layers in the lower atmosphere is a well-understood phenomenon. See Radio propagation.) * Mode conversion: Signals couple to plasma waves in the upper ionosphere. :Investigated experimentally by Crawford et al., they recorded echoes with delays up to 40 seconds at 5‚Äì12 MHz.F. W. Crawford, D. M. Sears, R. L. Bruce, \\"Possible observations and mechanism of very long delayed radio echoes,\\" Journal of Geophysical Research, Space Physics, vol. 75, no. 34, pp. 7326‚Äì7332, Dec. 1970. The signals from two separated transmitters T1 and T2, T2 transmitting CW or quasi-CW signals, interact nonlinearly in the ionosphere or magnetosphere. If the wave vector and frequency of the forced oscillation at the difference frequency of the two signals satisfies the dispersion relation for electrostatic waves, such waves would exist and begin to propagate. This wave could grow in amplitude due to wave-particle interaction. At a later time it could interact with the CW signal and propagate to T1.[Muldrew, D. B., Generation of long delay echoes, Journal of Geophysical Research, 84, 5199‚Äì5215, 1979. * Reflection from distant plasma clouds coming originally from the sun. :Freyman R. W. Freyman, \\"Measurements of long delayed radio echoes in the auroral zone,\\" Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 8, No. 4, pp. 385‚Äì388, April 1981. did experiments at 9.9 MHz and detected several thousand echoes of delay up to 16 seconds at times when solar plasma probably entered the magnetosphere. * Non-linearity in addition to mode conversion. Two transmitted signals combine to generate a difference frequency, which travels with a plasma wave, and then it is converted back. : It could explain amateur VHF/UHF echoes. Hans Rasmussen found echoes delayed by 4.6 seconds at 1296 MHzH. L. Rasmussen (OZ9CR), \\"Ghost echoes on the Earth-Moon path,\\" Nature, Vol. 257, p. 36, September 4, 1975., and Yurek recorded a 5.75 second delay at 432 MHz.J. Yurek (K3PGP), ‚ÄúEchoes: An amateur observation and a professional reply,‚Äù QST, 62, pp. 35‚Äì36, May 1978.  Alternative hypotheses Some believe that the aurora activity that follows a solar storm is the source of LDEs. Still others believe that LDEs are double EME (EMEME) reflections, i.e. the signal is reflected by the moon and that reflected signal is reflected by the Earth back to the moon and reflected again by the moon back to the earth. Duncan Lunan proposed the radio echoes observed by St√∏rmer and Van der Pol in 1928 might have been transmissions from a Bracewell probe, an artifact of aliens trying to communicate with us by bouncing back our own signals. This concept is also addressed by Holm. Deception Volker Grassmann writing in VHF Communications noted the possibility of individuals hoaxing LDEs, saying, \\"Attempts at deception can in no case be ruled out, and it is to be feared that less serious radio amateurs contribute to deliberate falsification.... Short transmissions using different frequencies are a relatively simple procedure for excluding potential troublemakers.\\" To reduce the possibilities of errors or hoaxes a worldwide logging system has been developed.Long Delayed Echo detection automated See also *Propagation mode Notes References * J.

Life  Born in Rottenburg am Neckar, Eugen Bolz was his parents' twelfth child. His father, Joseph Bolz, was a salesman. His mother was Maria Theresia Bolz (n√©e Huber). Three days later he was baptized on December 27, 1881, in the former Stiftskirche St. Moritz. He married in 1920 Maria Hoeness from Ulm; they had one daughter. Through his wife's family, Bolz was the uncle of Cardinal Paul Augustin Mayer (1911‚Äì2010).  Career  Bolz took his abitur in 1900 at the Karls-Gymnasium in Stuttgart.Karls-Gymnasium Stuttgart (Hrsg.):125 Jahre Karls-Gymnasium Stuttgart, Stuttgart 2006 He was involved in the Windthorstbund, the youth organization of the Centre Party (Germany). From 1900, he studied law at the University of T√ºbingen and at the universities of Bonn (1901) and Berlin (1901/02). He became a member of the Catholic student associations AV Guestfalia T√ºbingen, the KDStV Bavaria Bonn and the KAV Suevia Berlin, all in the CV. At the KAV Suevia Berlin he met the centre politician Felix Porsch who caused him to become a politician after graduation. In 1902, he continued his studies in T√ºbingen and graduated in 1905 from the first state examination. He then completed the traineeship in Rottenburg, Ravensburg and Stuttgart. After Bolz had passed second state examination in 1909, he worked as a laborer at the prosecution of Ulm. From 1911 to 1914, he worked as an assessor at the Stuttgart prosecution. During World War I he served as lieutenant in the Western Front in Alsace Peter Henkel: \\"Der Sklavenstaat muss verschwinden\\". In: Kontext, Ausgabe 195, 24. Dezember 2014. Not long after finishing his studies in Bonn and Berlin, he latched onto politics as a career and joined the Centre Party, which he represented in the Reichstag from 1912 to 1933, and from 1915 to 1933, also in the W√ºrttemberg Landtag. In W√ºrttemberg, he became Justice Minister in 1919 and Interior Minister in 1923. At the time when the National Socialists seized power in 1933, Bolz was W√ºrttemberg's Staatspr√§sident - the first Catholic to hold the position in predominantly Protestant W√ºrttemberg - and also Interior Minister. Since he was an adherent of Catholic social teaching, which made no secret of its loathing for the Nazis, it was no surprise that Bolz was one of the new r√©gime's greatest opponents. Owing to this, he was forced from office early in 1933 and wound up spending several weeks in a concentration camp. Led by the party whip, Bolz's party approved the new Erm√§chtigungsgesetz (\\"Enabling Act\\") on 23 March 1933, even though it weighed heavily on their conscience. After being released from the concentration camp, Bolz moved back to Beuron, near Ulm. There, he forswore politics for a while, busying himself mainly with economic issues, papal social encyclicals, and Catholic Action. During this time of involuntary retirement, he sometimes did work as a tax advisor, and he always knew that the Gestapo were watching him. In late 1941 and early 1942, he came into contact with the resistance circle about Carl Friedrich Goerdeler. Bolz readily declared that he would like to take over a ministerial post in the new government after Hitler was overthrown. Goerdeler put him down as Culture Minister in the cabinet that he foresaw having to put together. Among other things, this would have meant that Bolz would be taking Goebbels's place. However, on 20 July 1944, Goerdeler's plan fell apart when Claus von Stauffenberg's attempt to kill Hitler at the Wolf's Lair in East Prussia failed. Bolz was arrested on 12 August 1944, and on 21 December, he was sentenced to death at the German \\"People's Court\\" (Volksgerichtshof). He was beheaded at Pl√∂tzensee Prison in Berlin on 23 January 1945. Eugen Bolz at the Volksgerichtshof There is a memorial to Eugen Bolz in the form of a bronze plaque at the house where he was born, at K√∂nigstra√üe 53 in Rottenburg am Neckar. It bears, among other things, the Latin inscription \\"TIMOR DOMINI INITIUM SAPIENTIAE\\" -- \\"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom\\". The grammar school that he went to is now called the Eugen-Bolz-Gymnasium. A Catholic private school in Bad Waldsee and a Realschule in Ellwangen - both in Baden-W√ºrttemberg - are also named for him. One of the sitting rooms at the Baden-W√ºrttemberg Landtag is named after him. In downtown Stuttgart, at the K√∂nigsbau, stands a monument to Eugen Bolz. Stuttgart memorial Eugen Bolz In 2004, a new bell at the church where Bolz was baptized, St. Moriz in Rottenburg am Neckar, was named after him. Many other buildings, streets and squares in Germany are likewise connected with the name Eugen Bolz.  Eugen Bolz Study Endowment  Since 1994, there has been an \\"Eugen Bolz Study Endowment\\" (Studienstiftung Eugen Bolz). This endowment is for study and education, and is closely associated with the Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen (CV). It affords students an education in democracy and civics.

He was part of the Wyggeston family, which included at least one other William Wyggeston. Although the family had been influential before, he became extremely wealthy (in 1522 records indicate he paid 22% of the tax levied on Leicester), and became Mayor of the Corporation of Leicester twice, and represented Leicester in the Seventh Parliament of Henry VII. Life He was born c.1467, the son and heir of Alderman John Wigston of the Newarke, Leicester, who had been Mayor of Leicester in 1469. William was made a freeman of Leicester in 1493‚Äì94, filled various municipal offices and became Mayor of Leicester in 1499, was elected M.P. for Leicester in 1504, and was again made mayor in 1510. He was a wool merchant of the Staple of Calais, and it is stated on his monument that he was mayor of Calais four times. He was certainly mayor of Calais in November 1514. He married twice, firstly Isabella, sister of Alderman Richard Gillot, and secondly Agnes, the widow of a Mr Trotter. He had no children. Legacy Wyggeston was also known as a benefactor, and set up an early 'hospital' (almshouse) in Leicester in 1513, now called Wyggeston's Hospital, and funded by the income of the Swannington estate, which he bought in 1520. The hospital still exists as a retirement home for old people, based on Hinckley Road in the West End of Leicester. The original hospital was next to St Martin's Church (now Leicester Cathedral) After Wyggeston's death, his brother Thomas Wyggeston, as a trustee, used part of the money to establish a grammar school in Leicester. Whilst this eventually became defunct, it gave its name to the later Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys, succeeded by the Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College. Wyggeston Grammar School for Girls was founded not long after the Victorian boys' school. In 1981 it merged with another girls' grammar school in Leicester, Collegiate Girls' School, and stopped taking in girls at eleven. It instead became a Sixth Form college known as Wyggeston Collegiate Sixth Form College. Later still it became known as Regent College. Wyggeston is one of the figures honoured by Leicester's Clock Tower (which spells his name 'Wigston'). A Freemasons' meeting in Leicester named a Lodge after William Wyggeston which was consecrated on 1 July 1910. The Wyggeston Lodge, No.3448 also takes William Wyggeston's motto, \\"Date eleemosynam et ecce omnia munda sunt vobis\\"/\\"Give freely of yourself and behold all Worlds are yours\\".

It may involve pressure washing. Sometimes wash down involves rinsing with fresh water; other times it involves use of detergents and other chemicals. Food processing and packaging machinery Regulations for processing sensitive products such as food and pharmaceuticals require periodic thorough washing and sanitizing. Some equipment can be moved to a central washing facility. Other machinery must be cleaned in place using portable specialized washing equipment. High-pressure cleaning is used with water and cleaning chemicals. A washdown is usually a manual operation and is designed to kill bacteria and other microorganisms. Automatic cleaning of industrial equipment is often carried out by clean-in-place (CIP) and/or steam-in-place (SIP) operations. CIP(CIP) systems often make use of Programmable logic controllers and SCADA software. Decks and drivemwys Washdown is the process of using a stream of water to clean a flat or nearly flat outside surface. Typically the area cleaned is a large expanse of concrete or asphalt. The area is cleaned of dirt and debris by the use of the force and dissolving power of stream of water as projected from a hose. Generally, one person holds and aims the hose, though if the hose is longer than 300 feet then another person may be required to help move the hose itself. Water is typically squirted from the hose at a pressure of 300 psi. The hose itself can vary in length from 75 to 425 feet. Though typically the hose when used by a single person is 300 feet long. The hose itself carries water from a water main which attaches to the hose through what is called a ‚Äústinger‚Äú. The stinger screws into the water main pipe and is held there. Also, the stinger as it is pushed down into the water supply pipe opens a seal which releases the water into the hose. At the other end of the hose a nozzle regulates the flow of water and allows for a large fanned-out spray, as well as a more concentrated stream termed a needlepoint.

A Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Canada for two terms in the 1960s, he returned to Parliament a quarter-century later to work as a security guard. He was born on a farm in Bromptonville, Quebec in the Eastern Townships and was educated in Montreal at both English and French high schools. Asselin was descended from politicians on both sides of his family. He was the grandson of Edmund William Tobin, who had spent thirty years in the House of Commons, representing the same Quebec riding Asselin later represented. Tobin was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1930. His father, Joseph-Omer Asselin, was chairman of Montreal City Council's powerful executive committee. His mother, Beatrice Tobin, was a Liberal organizer in the era of William Lyon Mackenzie King, and served as president of the Women's Liberal Association of Canada in the 1960s. Her two sons both served as Liberal MPs. She had been awarded an Order of the British Empire during World War II for her work in establishing an organization to help Canadian Prisoners of War. After graduating from high school, Asselin attended St. Mary's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and then returned to his home town to run the family's dairy farm. He was also a Captain in the Canadian Army for ten years. During the 1963 federal election, he was serving as president of the Liberal riding association in Richmond‚ÄîWolfe, the rural Quebec constituency in which he lived, when the nominated Liberal candidate unexpectedly dropped out of the race 30 days before election day. Asselin stepped in as the new candidate, and defeated incumbent Social Credit MP Andr√© Bernier by 350 votes. Asselin's brother, Edmund Tobin Asselin, was re-elected in the Montreal riding of Notre- Dame-de-Gr√¢ce in the same election. The election brought to power a Liberal minority government under the leadership of Lester Pearson. Pearson appointed Asselin chairman of the House Standing Committee on Agriculture. Under his stewardship, the committee inaugurated Canada's marketing board system. Asselin's margin of victory increased to 2,000 votes at the 1965 election. When Pearson announced his retirement, Asselin supported Pierre Trudeau's campaign to become Liberal leader at the 1968 Liberal leadership convention. However, despite Trudeaumania, Asselin lost his seat at the 1968 election after the right-wing Ralliement Cr√©ditiste attacked the Liberal government in the rural, socially conservative riding over the government's social liberalism, particularly Trudeau's decriminalization of homosexuality. Both Asselin and Trudeau were accused of being Communists by supporters of Asselin's rival, L√©onel Beaudoin. \\"I got out of politics because of illness -- the voters got sick of me,\\" said Asselin. His defeat came six months short of the minimum period of service required at the time to qualify for a parliamentary pension. Following his defeat, Asselin worked as an aide to Agriculture minister Bud Olson. He returned to politics to serve as mayor of Aylmer, Quebec from 1979 to 1983. He subsequently returned to Ottawa to work as a security supervisor on Parliament Hill. Warren Allmand, a former Liberal Canadian cabinet minister, later said of Asselin: \\"He wasn't egotistical. Even though he had been an MP, he wasn't at all embarrassed to get a job as a security guard in order to earn a living and support his family.... Security work was all he could get, so he did it.\\" Asselin died in Ottawa in 2005 of a neurological disease.

The species naturally occurs in fresh and stagnant water bodies throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa, and in southern Yemen. Description Side view of a captive specimen, showing claws and lighter underside The marsh terrapin is typically a rather small turtle, with most individuals being less than in straight carapace length, but one has been recorded with a length of . It has a black or brown carapace. The top of the tail and limbs are a grayish brown, while the underside is yellowish. The male turtle is distinguished by its long, thick tail. A female tends to have a shorter tail and a broader carapace. A hatchling has a shell size of about in length, and is olive to black in color. It also has two small tubercles under the chin and musk glands in the sides of the carapace. Uniquely, the genus Pelomedusa does not have a hinged plastron (lower shell). All the other species in the family Pelomedusidae, however, do have this feature with which they can, using muscles, close the plastron to the carapace to cover the head and front limbs. Unlike many chelonians, the African helmeted turtle is able, when it finds itself upside down, to right itself with a vigorous flick of its long muscular neck.Baard EHW (1994). Cape Tortoises: Their identification and care. Cape Nature Conservation. Recent genetic research suggests that Pelomedusa comprises at least 10 different species, and not only one as previously thought. In the past the physical differences between populations were not regarded as substantial enough to recognise more than one species.Fritz, Uwe; Petzold, Alice; Kehlmaier, Christian; Kindler, Carolin; Cambell, Patrick; Hofmeyr, Margaretha D.; Branch, William R. (2014). \\"Disentangling the Pelomedusa complex using type specimens and historical DNA (Testudines: Pelomedusidae)\\". Zootaxa 3795 (5): 501%u2013522. Geographic range The geographic range of P. subrufa covers a large portion of Africa, from the Cape Peninsula to the Sudan. It can be found as far west as Ghana and as far south as Cape Town. It has also been found in Madagascar and Yemen.Branch B (2001). Tortoises, Terrapins and Turtles of Africa. Cape Town: Struik Publishers. . Life history Juvenile marsh terrapin Head retracted into shell =Habitat= P. subrufa is a semiaquatic animal, living in rivers, lakes, and marshes, and it also occupies rain pools and places that are fertilized. Its preference seems to be for standing water, such as swamps, pans, dams, and lakes. However it is found to a lesser extent along rivers. It is generally absent from regions that are mountainous, forested, or desert.Boycott R, Bourquin O (1988). The South African Tortoise Book. Johannesburg: Southern Book Publishers. p.60. =Diet= The African helmeted turtle is an omnivorous eater and will eat almost anything. It may feed on carrion. The fine claws on its feet help it tear its prey apart. Groups of P. subrufa have been observed capturing and drowning larger prey such as doves that come to drink; the commotion caused by these group attacks is often mistaken for crocodiles. All food is taken underwater to be eaten. Several large mammals such as warthogs, Cape buffalo, and rhinoceroses have recently been documented utilizing the turtles to remove parasites at popular wallowing holes. One such incident in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park involved two African helmeted turtles removing ticks and blood-sucking flies from the body of a wallowing warthog. Though the turtles probably do not have a symbiotic relationship with these animals, it is very likely that the buffalo, rhinos, and warthogs seek them out and have learned to utilize them from past experiences. This behavior was documented for the first time in the September 2015 issue of Herpetological Review by Andy and Michelle Leighty Jones. =Seasonal movements= During wet weather P. subrufa will often leave water bodies and embark on long overland journeys. During exceptionally dry weather when water bodies dry up, it will typically dig into the ground and bury itself until rains return; it has been known to spend months or even years in such a state. It will also hibernate during very cold weather, and aestivate during unusually hot, dry weather. =Reproduction= Courtship of P. subrufa is held year round. The male will follow the female, nodding his head in front of hers. If she is not responsive, she will nip and snap and walk away. If she is willing, she responds by nodding her head or just standing still, so he can mount her. While mating, each of the turtles shakes its head. The female will lay two to ten eggs on average, normally during late spring and early summer. The eggs are placed in a flask-shaped nest about deep. The eggs hatch in 75‚Äì 90 days.Orenstein, Ronald (2012). Turtles, Tortoises and Terrapins: A Natural History.

As a young official at the shipping company Elder Dempster, Morel observed a fortune in rubber returning from the Congo while only guns and manacles were being sent in return. He correctly deduced that these resources were being extracted from the population by force and began to campaign to expose the abuses. In collaboration with Roger Casement, Morel led a campaign against slavery in the Congo Free State, founding the Congo Reform Association and running the West African Mail. With the help of celebrities such as Arthur Conan Doyle and Mark Twain, the movement successfully pressured the Belgian King Leopold II to sell the Congo Free State to the Belgian government, ending some of the human rights abuses perpetrated under his rule. Morel played a significant role in the British pacifist movement during the First World War, participating in the foundation of and becoming secretary of the Union of Democratic Control, at which point he broke with the Liberal Party. In 1917, he was jailed for six months for his antiwar activism, which had a permanent effect on his health. After the war, he edited the journal Foreign Affairs, through which he sharply criticized what he considered French aggression and mistreatment of the defeated Central Powers. As part of his campaign against the French, he became the most important English proponent of the racist Black Shame campaign, which accused black French troops of outrages against the population of the occupied Rhineland. Morel was elected to Parliament in 1922 as a Labour candidate, defeating the incumbent Winston Churchill for his seat, and was reelected in 1924, dying in office. Morel collaborated closely with future prime minister Ramsay MacDonald and was considered for the post of Foreign Secretary, though he ultimately acted only as an unofficial adviser to MacDonald's government. Background Morel was born in the Avenue d'Eylau, Paris. His father, Edmond Pierre Marie Morel de Ville, was a French civil servant; his mother, Eliza Emmeline de Horne, was from an English Quaker family. Edmond died when the boy was four, leaving no pension,Hochschild, Adam. King Leopold's Ghost. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1998. p. 177. and Emmeline subsequently fell out with her late husband's family. As a consequence, Emmeline changed her name to Deville and raised her son on her own. To remove her son from the family's influence, she worked as a teacher so that she could send him to boarding school at both Madras House school in Eastbourne and later at Bedford Modern School. When Emmeline Deville fell ill in 1888, the money for school fees was no longer available and Edmund was forced to return to Paris to work as a bank clerk.Hochschild, p. 177. He was able to move his mother back to Britain in 1891. Five years later he successfully applied for naturalisation as a British subject and anglicised his name. He married Mary Richardson that same year; they had five children. His daughter Stella married the Polish political advisor Joseph Retinger in 1926; they had two daughters. Congo activism =Discoveries at Elder Dempster= Red Rubber: \\"The Story of the Rubber Slave Trade Flourishing on the Congo in the Year of Grace, 1906\\" In 1891, Morel obtained a clerkship with Elder Dempster, a Liverpool shipping firm.Dorward, David. \\"Morel, E.D.\\" In Colonialism: An International, Social, Cultural, and Political Encyclopedia, Volume 1. Eds. Melvin Eugene Page and Penny M. Sonnenburg. ABC-CLIO, 2003. p. 392. To increase his income and support his family, from 1893 Morel began writing articles against French protectionism, which was damaging Elder Dempster's business. He came to be critical of the Foreign Office for not supporting the rights of Africans under colonial rule. His vision of Africa was influenced by the books of Mary Kingsley, an English traveller and writer, which showed sympathy for African peoples and a respect for different cultures that was very rare amongst Europeans at the time.Hochschild, p. 188. Groups such as the Aborigines' Protection Society had already begun a campaign against alleged atrocities in Congo.Hochschild, p. 173. Elder Dempster had a shipping contract with the Congo Free State for the connection between Antwerp and Boma. Due to his knowledge of French, Morel was often sent to Belgium, where he was able to view the internal accounts of the Congo Free State held by Elder Dempster. The knowledge that the ships leaving Belgium for the Congo carried only guns, chains, ordnance and explosives, but no commercial goods, while ships arriving from the colony came back full of valuable products such as raw rubber and ivory, led him to the conclusion that Belgian King Leopold II's policy was exploitative and a type of slavery.Hochschild, pp. 178-180. According to author Adam Hochschild, Morel's conclusions were correct‚Äîthe value of the goods coming from the Congo Free State was five times that of the goods coming from Europe, and the difference was being extracted from the Congolese population through force and mass atrocities.Hochschild, p. 180. Morel discussed the discrepancies with the head of the Elder Dempster line, who responded coldly and dismissively. The company soon offered Morel an overseas promotion and then a sinecure consultancy in return for a guarantee of his silence. Morel refused both offers, and left the company in 1901 to become a full-time journalist.Hochschild, pp. 185-186. =Journalism and Congo Reform Association= In 1900, Morel put new life into the campaign against Congo misrule (begun a decade before by the American George Washington Williams) with a series of articles detailing his discoveries about the Congo Free State trade imbalances. His inside information made him a powerful voice against the exploitation, as previous activists had lacked his access to precise figures about the trade.Hochschild, p. 185. In 1903, he founded his own magazine, the West African Mail, with the collaboration of John Holt, a businessman and friend of Mary Kingsley, who feared that the system of the Congo Free State would be applied upon the rest of the West African colonies. The Mail was an \\"illustrated weekly journal founded to meet the rapidly growing interest in west and central African questions\\".Hochschild 1998, p. 186 The paper also received initial financial backing from Sir Alfred Lewis Jones, Morel's former employer at Elder Dempster, apparently in a final attempt to moderate Morel's criticism of the company, but Jones soon discontinued his support.Hochschild, p. 213. Morel published several pamphlets and his first book, Affairs of West Africa, a collection of his essays.Olusanya, G.O. \\"Reviewed Work: AFFAIRS OF WEST AFRICA by E. D. Morel.\\". Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria. Vol. 4, No. 4, June 1969. pp. 639-641. Roger Casement's 1904 report confirmed Morel's accusations In 1903, under pressure from Morel's campaign, the British House of Commons passed a resolution protesting human rights abuses in the Congo.Hochschild, pp. 194-95. Subsequently, the British consul in the Congo, Roger Casement, was sent up country by the Foreign Office for an investigation.Hochschild, p. 195. Casement was outraged by the evidence of atrocities that he discovered and wrote a blistering report in 1904, discussing its contents with the London press even before its official release.Hochschild, pp. 201-204. Morel was introduced to Casement by their mutual friend Herbert Ward just before the publication of the report and realised that in Casement he had found the ally he had sought.Pavlakis, Dean. British Humanitarianism and the Congo Reform Movement, 1896-1913. Abingdon: Routledge, 2016.Hochschild, pp. 204-205. Casement convinced Morel to establish an organisation for dealing specifically with the Congo question, the Congo Reform Association; because of the restrictions placed on Casement by his official duties, Morel would be the organisation's head.Hochschild, pp. 206-207. Affiliates of the Congo Reform Association were established as far away as the United States. The Belgian socialist leader Emile Vandervelde aided Morel by sending him copies of parliamentary debates The Congo Reform Association had the support of famous writers such as Joseph Conrad (whose Heart of Darkness was inspired by a voyage to the Congo Free State),Pavlakis. Anatole France,Hochschild, p. 236. Nobel laureates Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson and John Galsworthy,Hochschild, p. 273. Sherlock Holmes creator Arthur Conan Doyle,Hochschild, p. 271. civil rights activist Booker T. Washington, and Mark Twain.Hochschild, pp. 241-242. Conan Doyle wrote The Crime of the Congo in 1908, while Twain gave the most famous contribution with the satirical short story \\"King Leopold's Soliloquy\\". Conrad and Ford Madox Ford also included a devastating parody of Leopold II in their cowritten novel The Inheritors.Hochschild, p. 257. Morel's best allies, however, may have been the Christian missionaries who furnished him with eyewitness accounts and photographs of the atrocities, such as those given by the Americans William Morrison and William Henry Sheppard,Hochschild, pp. 259-260. and the British John Hobbis Harris and Alice Harris.Hochschild, p. 216. The chocolate millionaire William Cadbury, a Quaker, was one of his main financial backers.Hochschild, pp. 213, 216. The Belgian socialist leader Emile Vandervelde sent him copies of Belgian parliamentary debates and was recruited by Morel to successfully defend the missionaries Sheppard and Morrison pro bono in a libel suit brought by Kasai Rubber Company.Hochschild, pp. 263-264. Morel also had secret connections with some agents within the Congo Free State itself. Even the Church of England and American religious groups backed him. In 1905 the movement won a victory when a Commission of Enquiry, instituted (under external pressure) by King L√©opold II himself, substantially confirmed the accusations made about the colonial administration.Hochschild, p. 251. In the face of mounting public and diplomatic pressure, in 1908 the Congo was annexed to the Belgian government and put under its sovereignty.Hochschild, pp. 257-259. Despite this, Morel refused to declare an end to the campaign until 1913 because he wanted to see actual changes in the situation of the country. The Congo Reform Association ended operations in 1913.Hochschild, pp. 271-273. World War I activism E.D. Morel before WWI =Foreign policy= During the Agadir Crisis of 1911, Morel was entirely in sympathy with Germany and opposed to what he regarded as bellicosity by the United Kingdom and France, as well as secret diplomacy between the states involved.Rodriguez, J. (2011). Slavery in the Modern World: A History of Political, Social, and Economic Oppression. ABC-CLIO. p. 405. He wrote Morocco in Diplomacy (1912) to express his views on the issue. At this time he was also selected by the Liberal Party as a prospective House of Commons candidate for Birkenhead. =Pacifism and formation of Union of Democratic Control= As the tension grew in the run-up to World War I, Morel was again sympathetic to Germany, disinclined to stand by Belgium under German pressure, and opposed to the United Kingdom and France getting involved in war. He campaigned for neutrality but on the outbreak of war accepted that the fight was lost, and with Charles Trevelyan, Norman Angell and Ramsay MacDonald, formed the Union of Democratic Control to press for a more responsive foreign policy (he also resigned his candidature at this time). He was Secretary of the UDC until his death. The main demands of the UDC were: (1) that in future to prevent secret diplomacy there should be parliamentary control over foreign policy; (2) there should be negotiations after the war with other democratic European countries in an attempt to form an organisation to help prevent future conflicts; (3) that at the end of the war the terms of peace should neither humiliate the defeated nation nor artificially rearrange frontiers, as this might provide a cause for future wars. The Union of Democratic Control became the most important of all the anti-war organisations in Britain, with membership reaching 650,000 by 1917. His political courage was praised by people such as Bertrand Russell and the writer Romain Rolland, but his leading role in the pacifist movement exposed him to violent attacks led by the pro-war press. He was pictured as an agent of Germany in the Daily Express, a newspaper that also listed details of future UDC meetings and encouraged its readers to attend and break them up. The accusation gained some credibility when Roger Casement, who was known as a friend and supporter of Morel, was hanged for treason (he had contacted the Germans seeking support for Irish nationalism). Morel was even the victim of occasional physical assaults.''''' =Imprisonment= On 22 August 1917 Morel's house was searched and evidence was discovered that he had sent a UDC pamphlet to Romain Rolland in Switzerland, a neutral country, which was a breach of the Defence of the Realm Act. Morel was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, which he served in Pentonville Prison. Although along with other pacifists, he was placed in the 'second division', allowing some privileges over the majority of prisoners, conditions were very hard, and Morel's health was seriously damaged. Russell described his condition at his release: Morel was released in January 1918. =Independent Labour Party membership= In April 1918, he joined the Independent Labour Party, and began to feed his views into the Labour Party to which it was affiliated and which adopted his critical view of the Treaty of Versailles. Morel explained his decision to join the Independent Labour Party to a friend: Postwar activism =Treaty of Versailles= Morel was severely critical of the Treaty of Versailles and warned that it would lead to another war. He particularly opposed the assignment of \\"war guilt\\" exclusively to the Central Powers as well as the mandate system for former German colonies. The latter theme became the focus of his 1920 book The Black Man's Burden. He did not give up his career as a journalist, becoming director of the UDC's journal, originally titled The UDC, later Foreign Affairs: A Journal of International Understanding.Orzuff, Andrea. Battle for the Castle: The Myth of Czechoslovakia in Europe, 1914-1948. Oxford University Press, USA. 2009. p. 153. Foreign Affairs became a significant voice of the English left about foreign politics at the time and represented the views of the UDC.Ashworth, Lucian M. International Relations and the Labour Party: Intellectuals and Policy Making from 1918-1945. I.B.Tauris, 2007. p. 61. In his articles for the magazine, Morel blamed France and Tsarist Russia, not the Central Powers, for the origins of the war and was scathingly critical of French imperialism. Morel's articles also deplored the fate of the new nation of Hungary, which had been part of the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary before the war. The former Kingdom of Hungary was stripped of more than two thirds of its territory and most of its population in the 1920 Treaty of Trianon.\\"Treaty of Trianon.\\" Encyclopaedia Britannica. Accessed 1 May 2018. Morel portrayed Hungary as a victim of French rapacity that reduced it to \\"Hopeless, Heart- Breaking Bondage\\". =The Black Horror on the Rhine= As part of his general opposition to French foreign policy, Morel played a key role in launching the British-based part of the Black Shame campaign, a racist campaign against the use by the French Army during its occupation of the Rhineland. In a front-page article in The Daily Herald on 9 April 1920 by Morel about the French occupation of the Rhineland, the headline read, \\": \\"Frankfurt runs red with blood French Blood Troops Use Machine-guns on Civilians\\".Reinders, Robert C. \\"Racialism on the Left: E.D. Morel and the 'Black Horror on the Rhine.'\\" International Review of Social History, Volume 13. 1968. p. 1. The following day, the same paper had another cover story by Morel, the title of which was \\"Black Scourge In Europe Sexual Horror Let Loose by France On Rhine Disappearance of Young German Girls\\". In it, Morel wrote that France is \\"thrusting her black savages into the heart of Germany\\" and that the \\"primitive African savages, the carriers of syphilis, have become a horror and a terror\\" to the Rhinelanders. In his article, Morel claimed that the Senegalese soldiers serving in the French Army were \\"primitive African barbarians\\" who \\"stuffed their haversacks with eye-balls, ears and heads of the foe\\".Campbell, Peter. \\"The 'Black Horror on the Rhine': Idealism, Pacifism, and Racism in Feminism and the Left in the Aftermath of the First World War.\\" Social History, Volume XLVII, Issue 94. June 2014. p. 477 Morel declared in his article: > \\"There [the Rhineland] they [the Senegalese soldiers] have become a terror > and a horror unimaginable to the countryside, raping girls and women-for > well known physiological reasons, the raping of a white woman by a negro is > nearly always accompanied by serious injuries and not infrequently has fatal > results; spreading syphilis, murdering inoffensive civilians, often getting > completely out of control; the terrible barbaric incarnation of a barbarous > policy, embodied in a so-called peace treaty which puts the clock back 2,000 > years\\". Morel wrote that \\"black savages\\" have uncontrolled sexual impulses that \\"must be satisfied upon the bodies of white women!\\" (emphasis in the original).Lusane, Clarence Hitler's Black Victims: The Historical Experiences of Afro-Germans, European Blacks, Africans, and African Americans in the Nazi Era, London: Psychology Press, 2002 p. 73. The phrase that Morel coined to describe the alleged terror by Senegalese troops in the Rhineland was the \\"Black Horror on the Rhine\\", which became internationally famous, and the campaign against the \\"black horror\\" took much of his time for the last four years of his life.Reinders, p. 2. Morel predicated the \\"black horror\\" would cause another world war, writing that the average German boy was thinking: \\"Boys these men raped your mothers and sisters\\" (emphasis in the original).Reinders, p. 5. Morel used the \\"black horror\\" as a way of attacking France, which he claimed had caused a \\"sexual horror on the Rhine\\" and whose \\"reign of terror\\" was a ‚Äúgiant evil\\" that should inspire \\"shame into all four corners of the world\\" and ultimately should \\"a revision of the Versailles Treaty and the relief for Germany\\".Wigger, Iris. The 'Black Horror on the Rhine': Intersections of Race, Nation, Gender and Class in 1920s Germany. London: Macmillan, 2017. p. 60. The German sociologist Iris Wigger wrote that Morel's \\"Black Horror on the Rhine\\" campaign has caused much embarrassment to Morel's admirers today, who would rather remember the man who campaigned against the Congo Free State, but in fact, both campaigns were manifestations of the same racism since he believed that all black people were innately stupid and inferior to white people in all respects. Through Morel had been very forceful in condemning the cruel exploitation of the Congo Free State, Morel believed in a liberal imperialism, just not the cruel exploitative imperialism of the Congo Company. He wrote that it was the duty of whites to serve as the \\"trustees\\" for blacks and the \\"great white father\\" who would protect the \\"basic human rights\\" of Africans while at the same time accepting the \\"infantile\\" nature of black people, who not the equal in any way of whites.Wigger, p. 54. Morel himself did not see his campaign as racist and always presented himself as a friend to black people. In France, the French socialist Charles Gide wrote about Morel's claims to be a protector of Africans: le genre de protection de M. Morel rappelle un peu le precepte que fait afficher la Society protectrice des animaux: 'Soyez bons pour les betes (Mr. Morel's kind of protection remind a bit of the precepts of the Society for the Protection of Animals: 'Be good to the animals').Reinders, p. 19. In particular, Morel believed that Africans, lacking the self-discipline of whites, had an uncontrolled sexuality and often wrote about that subject.Wigger, pp. 52-53. Morel believed that because of the high infant mortality in the tropics that Africans had evolved in such a way as to be obsessed with sex, to the exclusion of everything else, as they needed a high birth rate to maintain their numbers. Precisely because Morel believed in the uncontrolled sexuality of blacks, he considered it self-evident that the \\"sexually uncontrolled and uncontrollable\\" Senegalese would run amok in the Rhineland and rape every German female in sight.Wigger, p. 57. Two contemporaries challenged Morel on that: Claude McKay, the Jamaican poet and labour activist, and Norman Leys, the British Africanist. Leys stated that such allegations constituted \\"one of the great sources of race hatred\\" and \\"should never be repeated by any honest man or honest newspaper\\". Morel was very anti-French because of his opposition to the Treaty of Versailles but also the nature of France's mission civilisatrice (\\"civilizing mission\\") in Africa, with any African willing to embrace the French language and culture becoming French and theoretically the equal of whites, threatened to upend Morel's beliefs in the essential biological inferiority of blacks.Wigger, pp. 55-56. Morel believed that the Africans were committing outrageous crimes against Germans in the Rhineland because the French had empowered them, at least theoretically, by making them into black Frenchmen, who were just as much French citizens as anyone else. Parliament In the 1922 general election, which followed the retirement of an incumbent Labour Member of Parliament, Alexander Wilkie, Morel fought the two-member Dundee constituency as a sole Labour candidate. Although he gained fewer votes than Edwin Scrymgeour of the Scottish Prohibition Party, he won the second seat, in the process defeating one of the outgoing members, Winston Churchill, standing as a National Liberal. Morel regarded Churchill as a warmonger and took pride in having defeated him: \\"I look upon Churchill as such a personal force for evil that I would take up the fight against him with a whole heart\\".Wright, Patrick. Iron Curtain: From Stage to Cold War. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007. p. 170. With his foreign affairs specialty, he was expected to be appointed as Foreign Secretary in the government of Ramsay MacDonald in 1924, but MacDonald decided to serve as his own Foreign Secretary.Wustenbecker, Katja. \\"Morel, E. D.\\" In World War I Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. ABC CLIO, 2005. p. 815 Possibly in compensation, MacDonald led an attempt to nominate Morel for the Nobel Prize for Peace.Cline, Catherine Ann. E.D. Morel, 1873-1924: The Strategies of Protest. Blackstaff Press, Ltd.: 1980. p. 134. In August 1924, Morel is believed to have persuaded MacDonald to recognise the communist government in the Soviet Union and nominations on the Anglo-Soviet trade treaty. Shortly after his re-election in the 1924 general election, Morel suffered a fatal heart attack in London.  Legacy  Arthur Conan Doyle became acquainted with Morel through the work of the Congo Reform Association.

Oregon, 546 U.S. 243 (2006), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court which ruled that the United States Attorney General cannot enforce the federal Controlled Substances Act against physicians who prescribed drugs, in compliance with Oregon state law, to terminally ill patients seeking to end their lives, often referred to as medical aid in dying.. It was the first major case heard by the Roberts Court under the new Chief Justice of the United States. Background In November 1994, voters in the state of Oregon approved Measure 16, a ballot initiative that established the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, with 51.3% of voters supporting it and 48.7% opposing it. The Act legalized medical aid in dying in the state of Oregon. The law permits physicians to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a competent adult, agreed by two doctors to be within six months of dying from an incurable condition.ORS 127.800 - 127.897 As of February 29, 2012, the Oregon Public Health Division reported that since \\"the law was passed in 1997, a total of 935 people have had DWDA prescriptions written and 596 patients (64% of prescriptions) have died from ingesting medications prescribed under the DWDA.\\" Opponents of the measure sued, and on December 27, 1994, U.S. District Judge Michael Robert Hogan issued a preliminary injunction forbidding the state from enforcing the statute,Lee v. Oregon, 869 F. Supp. 1491 (D. Or. 1994). then, on August 3, 1995, declared the law unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.Lee v. Oregon, 891 F. Supp. 1429 (D. Or. 1995). However, after the Supreme Court of the United States rejected that reasoning in Washington v. Glucksberg (1997), the measure was allowed to take effect.Note, Emily P. Hughes, The Oregon Death with Dignity Act: Relief of Suffering at the End of Medicine‚Äôs Ability to Heal, 95 Geo. L.J. 207 (2006). A 1997 referral to voters by the Oregon Legislative Assembly aimed to repeal the Death with Dignity Act but was defeated by a 60% margin. Members of Congress next sought to have the federal government prosecute physicians obeying the new Oregon law, and DEA Administrator Thomas A. Constantine told them that he had authority to do so under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).Jacob E. Gersen, \\"Overlapping and Underlapping Jurisdiction in Administrative Law, 2006 Sup. Ct. Rev. 201. However, Attorney General Janet Reno rejected that interpretation of the law and determined the federal government had no power to interfere with physicians obeying the Oregon law. Senator John Ashcroft then supported legislation explicitly granting the Attorney General that authority, but the bills failed to pass., 105th Cong. (1998); , 105th Cong. (1999); , 106th Cong. (2000). After Senator Ashcroft became United States Attorney General in 2001, he secured a memorandum from the Office of Legal Counsel concluding that physician-assisted suicide violates the CSA.Whether Physician-Assisted Suicide Serves a ‚ÄúLegitimate Medical Purpose‚Äù Under DEA Regulations, 25 Op. O.L.C. 135 (June 27, 2001). Id. relying, inter alia, on Neil Gorsuch, The Right to Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia, 23 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol‚Äôy 599 (2000). On November 9, 2001, Attorney General Ashcroft published an \\"Interpretive Rule\\" that physician-assisted suicide was not a legitimate medical purpose and that any physician administering federally controlled drugs for that purpose would be in violation of the Controlled Substances Act.66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (Nov. 9, 2001). Oregon Attorney General Hardy Myers, joined by a physician, a pharmacist, and a group of terminally ill patients, all from Oregon, filed a challenge to Attorney General Ashcroft's interpretation in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. On April 17, 2002, U.S. District Judge Robert E. Jones granted summary judgment to Oregon and issued a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the Interpretive Rule.The Supreme Court, 2005 Term ‚Äî Leading Cases, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 125 (2006). Oregon v. Ashcroft, 192 F. Supp. 2d 1077 (D. Or. 2002). On May 26, 2004, that ruling was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, with Judge Richard C. Tallman joined by Senior Circuit Judge Donald P. Lay, over the dissent of Senior Circuit Judge John Clifford Wallace.Oregon v. Ashcroft, 368 F.3d 1118 (9th Cir. 2004). The circuit panel majority invoked a clear statement rule regarding federalism in the United States to reject the Attorney General Ashcroft's interpretation.Recent Case, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 1371 (2005). The federal government's petition for a writ for certiorari was granted and one hour of oral arguments were heard on October 5, 2005, with Paul Clement, the Solicitor General of the United States, personally appearing. Opinion of the Court On January 17, 2006, the Court delivered judgment in favor of Oregon, affirming the lower court by a vote of 6‚Äì3. Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer determined that the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) did not give the Attorney General the power to interfere with physicians obeying the state law. The Court did not dispute the power of the federal government to regulate drugs, but it disagreed that the statute in place empowered the attorney general to overrule state laws on the appropriate use of medications allowed. The Court first determined it did not need to grant substantial deference to the Justice Department's interpretation of its own regulation under Auer v. Robbins (1997) because the regulation merely restated the terms of the CSA. Likewise, the Court found that, although the phrase \\"legitimate medical purpose\\" in the statute is ambiguous, the Attorney General's interpretation was not entitled to Chevron deference because the CSA delegated medical judgments to the expertise of the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, not to the Attorney General. Finally, the Court found the Attorney General's conclusions regarding the phrase unpersuasive under Skidmore v. Swift & Co. (1944) because Congress would have been more explicit if it had intended to empower the Attorney General to unilaterally create new crimes through regulation. Dissents =Justice Scalia= Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas, dissented. Scalia believed that agency deference should be given to the Attorney General under both Auer and Chevron. Even without granting any agency deference, the Attorney General's interpretation was reasonable because, Scalia argued: \\"If the term 'legitimate medical purpose' has any meaning, it surely excludes the prescription of drugs to produce death.\\"546 U.S. 243 (2006) (Scalia, J., dissenting). =Justice Thomas= Justice Thomas also filed a brief dissent, alone. Thomas made clear that, although he still believes the CSA is not empowered by the Constitution's Interstate Commerce Clause to regulate purely intrastate conduct, if it were, the Attorney General's interpretation of the statute would be reasonable. Thomas argued that the opinion of the Court was inconsistent with the reasoning in Gonzales v. Raich (2005). He also dissented in that decision in which five of the six justices in the majority in Oregon found broad federal authority under the CSA for Congress to forbid the growth of medical marijuana. Thomas had argued for a more limited congressional power under the Commerce Clause in Raich, which focused on intrastate and interstate commerce. In Oregon, by contrast, the case was a matter of the validity of an executive interpretation of that statute.546 U.S. 243 (2006) (Thomas, J., dissenting).

In the back of the restaurant is an office where Boss Hogg conducts many of his crooked business schemes. The basement has an escape tunnel, which was used in the days when the Hogg and Duke families were involved in moonshine running and were trying to elude the authorities. Outside the business are two HoggoCo gas pumps and ample parking space. The parking lot often serves as the starting and finishing lines for various races that take place in Hazzard County. In the 1997 The Dukes of Hazzard: Reunion! movie, the original Boar's Nest had been burned down by a wedding party, and a new one was built in town.

Part of the Portmeirion Group since 2009, Royal Worcester remains in the luxury tableware and giftware market, although production in Worcester itself has ended. Technically, the Worcester Royal Porcelain Co. Ltd. (known as Royal Worcester) was formed in 1862, and although the company had a royal warrant from 1788, wares produced before that time, as well as those produced at two other factories in Worcester, are known as Worcester porcelain. The enterprise has followed the pattern of other leading English porcelain brands, with increasing success during the 18th and 19th centuries, then a gradual decline during the 20th century, especially the latter half. Early history Prior to 1751, John Wall, a physician, and William Davis, an apothecary, attempted to develop a method of making porcelain that could then be used to boost prosperity and employment in Worcester. The success of their early experimentation is unknown, but they clearly came into contact around 1750-1751 with the Bristol porcelain manfactory of Lund and Miller, who were using soaprock (steatite) as a prime raw material in their porcelain production. This appears to be a then-unique method for producing porcelain. In 1751, Wall and Davis persuaded a group of 13 businessmen to invest in a new factory at Warmstry House, Worcester, England, on the banks of the River Severn, but whether the business plan put forward to the prospective partners was based on the future buy out of Lund's Bristol porcelain factory is uncertain.The Origins of Worcester Porcelain, Ray Jones, 2018, Parkbarn, Wall and Davis secured the sum of ¬£4500 from the partners to establish the factory, known then as \\"The Worcester Tonquin Manufactory\\"; the original partnership deeds are still housed in the Museum of Worcester Porcelain.Dr. Wall and the first Worcester factory (Worcester Porcelain Museum - 31 Dec 2010).Jervis, William Percival. A Pottery Primer pp. 104-6 (New York: The O'Gorman Publishing Co., 1911). Richard Holdship, a Quaker and major shareholder, was prominent in the process of the subsequent ‚Äòbuy out‚Äô of the Bristol manufactory in early 1752. Holdship personally bought from Benjamin Lund, a fellow Quaker, the soaprock licence that ensured the mining of 20 tons p.a. of soaprock from Cornwall.‚ÄòThe Origins of Worcester Porcelain‚Äô, Ray Jones, 2018, Parkbarn, The early wares were soft-paste porcelain with bodies that contained soaprock, commonly called in most ceramic circles as soapstone. The chemical analyses of these wares closely correlates to those of the Bristol manufactory. This places Worcester in a group of early English potteries including Caughley and factories in Liverpool.Osborne, Harold (ed), The Oxford Companion to the Decorative Arts, p. 141, 1975, OUP,  The Flight and Barr partnerships  Soft-paste armorial porcelain plate with the coat of arms of the Duke of Clarence, future William IV, 1789, Flight factory, Diameter: 9.7 inches In 1783, the factory was purchased by Thomas Flight‚Äîthe former London sales agent for the concern‚Äîfor ¬£3,000. He let his two sons run the concern, with John Flight taking the lead role till his death in 1791. In 1788 George III, following a visit to the company, granted it a royal warrant, and it became known as the \\"Royal Porcelain Works\\".Royal Porcelain Works. A guide through the Royal Porcelain Work (1895) p37. Knowledge of this period is largely a result of the excellent diary that John Flight kept from 1785‚Äì1791. This is discussed in detail in Appendix III of Flight & Barr Worcester Porcelain by Henry Sandon. During this period, the factory was in poor repair. Production was limited to low-end patterns of mostly Blue and White porcelains after Chinese porcelain designs of the period. It was also pressured by competition from inexpensive Chinese export porcelain, and from Thomas Turner‚Äôs Caughley (pronounced \\"Calf-ley\\") Factory. Female side of Aesthetic teapot designed by R. W. Binns and modeled by James Hadley, 1881. Martin Barr joined the firm as a partner in 1792; porcelains of this period are often identified by an incised capital \\"B\\" and, later, by more elaborate printed and impressed marks. Thomas Flight died in 1800, leaving the factory in the hands of his son Joseph Flight and Martin Barr. Barr‚Äôs sons Martin Barr Jr. and George Barr were being prepared at that time to run the factory. In addition to the warrant granted by George III, royal warrants were also issued by the Prince of Wales in 1807, and the Princess of Wales in 1808. Chamberlain and Grainger factories \\"Worcester porcelain\\" also includes the hard-paste porcelain wares made in Chamberlain's Factory and Grainger's Factory, as they tend to be referred to in catalogues and museum descriptions. Both of these began as decorating shops in Worcester, painting \\"blanks\\" made by other factories, but after a few years began to make their own porcelain. Chamberlain's Factory, which was very high quality and in 1811 received its own royal warrant from the Prince Regent, had begun to manufacture by 1791. In 1840, at a time when both businesses were having difficulties keeping up with a changing market, it merged with the main Flight and Barr concern as \\"Chamberlain & Company.\\"Chamberlain\\", Museum of Royal Worcester; Battie, 139, 171-172 Grainger's Factory was making porcelain from 1807, though not of quite the highest quality. Under a succession of partnership and company names the Grainger family retained significant shares until the death of the last member in 1889, when Royal Worcester took them over. As Grainger & Co the factory and name were used until 1902, when a full transfer to the main factory took place. Some Grainger moulds remained in use in the 21st century. The factory site at St Martin‚Äôs Gate was used from 1809 to 1902.\\"Grainger‚Äôs Worcester Porcelain\\", Museum of Royal Worcester; Battie, 139 Worcester Porcelain Museum japonist\\" vases, 1873 (Indianapolis Museum of Art) The factory's former site includes the independent Museum of Royal Worcester (formerly known as the 'Dyson Perrins Museum' and 'Worcester Porcelain Museum') owned by the Dyson Perrins Museum Trust. The Museum houses the world‚Äôs largest collection of Worcester porcelain. The collections date back to 1751 and the Victorian gallery, the ceramic collections, archives and records of factory production, form the primary resource for the study of Worcester porcelain and its history.

After the 1976 merger with Spode, and due to heavy competition from overseas, the production was switched to factories in Stoke and abroad. 100 staff were made redundant in 2003, and another 100 went in 2005. Fifteen porcelain painters left the Severn Street factory on Friday 29 September 2006, together with 100 other workers. The last trading date for Royal Worcester was 14 June 2009.

Tobback is a Flemish social democrat and member of the political party SP.A. He was the mayor of Leuven (1995‚Äì2018) He graduated in Romance philology at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. He is the father of Bruno Tobback, the former president of the Flemish socialist party Different Socialist Party (SP.A). Political career He started his political career in 1965 in the OCMW/CPAS council. In 1971 he was elected a member of the city council of Leuven, and became eerste schepen (first alderman). In 1974, he became the leader of the Belgian Socialist Party faction in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, and became a controversial but respected politician. Tobback is known for his oneliners in which he clearly states his opinion. From 1988 until 1994, Tobback was Belgium's Minister of the Interior in two coalitions formed by Christian Democrats and Socialists, who faced the tough task of bringin Belgium into compliance with the Maastricht Treaty. It was known that he liked cooperating with Jean-Luc Dehaene, who was Prime Minister from 1992 until 1999. In 1994 he became president of the Flemish social-democratic party (SP, since 2001 known as Socialistische Partij Anders, SP.A). At that time, the party faced difficulties due to the Agusta scandal in which several Flemish and Francophone Socialists were accused of corruption. Despite this, the party did not lose too many votes in the federal and regional elections in 1995. As president of the SP, he also started a campaign of ideological and organisational innovation within the party. In 1995, Tobback also became the mayor of Leuven, and he was granted the title of Minister of State in recognition of his work in politics. He was re-elected as mayor in 2000, 2006 and 2012 and retired on 31 December 2018. In April 1998, he again became Minister of the Interior, after Johan Vande Lanotte (also SP.A) resigned because of the escape of Marc Dutroux during his transport from jail to the court hall. In September 1998, Tobback himself resigned after a Nigerian candidate for immigration (Semira Adamu) died during her forced repatriation. Tobback is a self-declared Orangist. He considers the break-up of the Netherlands and Belgium a historic mistake. \\"If the United Kingdom of the Netherlands would have endured, we would have been a member of the G8 today\\", Tobback said in 2006.

Russell, A History of Heaven (1998) p. 21 and it became a staple of the pastoral works of poets such as Theocritus and Virgil. Horace (Ars poetica, 17) and the commentators on Virgil, such as Servius, recognize that descriptions of loci amoeni have become a rhetorical commonplace. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, the function of the locus amoenus is inverted, to form the \\"locus terribilis\\".

Community The civil parish also includes the hamlet of Yealand Storrs. The village borders Yealand Conyers and the villages share their facilities. The shared history of the Yealands goes back to at least the Norman invasion and they are recorded in the Doomsday Book as Jalant (this is presumed to include the area that became Silverdale). The local district also has a strong Viking history as seen in many of the names of nearby geographical features and place names as well as the recent discovery of the Silverdale Hoard in the village. Today, Yealand Redmayne is still the biggest village by area but has a smaller population than Silverdale. The village contains a busy transport corridor as the A6 and M6 roads as well as the West Coast Main Line and the Lancaster Canal all pass through the parish. There is a miniature railway track near the A6 at Cinderbarrow. Geography The village is situated 11 miles north of Lancaster on the county boundary with Cumbria. Carnforth is the nearest town in Lancashire and Milnthorpe in Cumbria. To the north is Beetham, to the east is Burton and north east Holme while its western boundary is with Silverdale, with Arnside, and the River Kent to the north west.

This can be used for either an internal combustion engine, where the fuel is burned within the cylinders of the engine, or external combustion engine, such as a steam engine, where the combustion of the fuel takes place outside the working cylinders of the engine. A fairly comprehensive yet understandable study of stroke/bore effects was published in Horseless Age, 1916. Conventions In a piston engine, there are two different ways of describing the stroke ratio of its cylinders, namely: bore/stroke ratio, and stroke/bore ratio. =Bore/stroke ratio= Bore/stroke is the more commonly used term, with usage in North America, Europe, United Kingdom, Asia, and Australia. The diameter of the cylinder bore is divided by the length of the piston stroke to give the ratio. Square, oversquare and undersquare engines The following terms describe the naming conventions for the configurations of the various bore/stroke ratio: =Square engine= A square engine has equal bore and stroke dimensions, giving a bore/stroke value of exactly 1:1. Square engine examples 1953 ‚Äì Ferrari 250 Europa had Lampredi V12 with bore and stroke. 1967 ‚Äì FIAT 125, 124Sport engine 125A000-90 hp, 125B000-100 hp, 125BC000-110 hp, 1608 ccm, DOHC, bore and stroke. 1970 ‚Äì Ford 400 had a bore and stroke. 1973 ‚Äì Kawasaki Z1 and KZ(Z)900 had a bore and stroke. 1973 ‚Äì British Leyland's Australian division created a 4.4-litre version of the Rover V8 engine, with bore and stroke both measuring 88.9 mm. This engine was exclusively used in the Leyland P76. 1982 - Honda Nighthawk 250 and Honda CMX250C Rebel have a bore and stroke, making it a square engine. 1983 ‚Äì Mazda FE 2.0L inline four-cylinder engine with a perfectly squared bore and stroke. This engine also features the ideal 1.75:1 rod/stroke ratio. 1987 ‚Äì The Opel/Vauxhaul 2.0 L GM Family II engines are square at bore and stroke; example as C20XE C20NE C20LET X20A X20XEV X20XER Z20LET Z20LEH Z20LER A20NHT A20NFT. 1989 ‚Äì Nissan's SR20DE is a square engine, with an bore and stroke. 1990 ‚Äì Maserati Shamal had biturbo V8 engine AM 479 with bore and stroke. This engine, after modifications, was later installed in Quattroporte IV and 3200 GT. 1990‚Äì2010 Saab B234/B235 is a square engine, with a bore and stroke. 1991 ‚Äì Ford's 4.6 V8 OHC engine has a bore and stroke. It has been the backbone of Ford V8-powered cars and trucks in different power levels and head designs for two decades. 1995 ‚Äì The BMW M52 engine with a displacement of 2793 cubic centimeters is an example of a perfect square engine with an bore and stroke. 1996 ‚Äì Jaguar's AJ-V8 engine in 4.0-litre form has an 86.0 mm bore and stroke. 2000 ‚Äì Mercedes-Benz 4.0-litre () OM628 V8 diesel engine is an example of a square engine ‚Äì with an bore and stroke. The Volkswagen Group's 2005 W16 engine as used in the Bugatti Veyron also using a bore and stroke. The Peugeot XU10 engine line ‚Äì with a displacement of 1998 cubic centimeters ‚Äì is an example of a perfect square engine with an bore and stroke. Toyota's 2JZ and 4U are square engines, with bore and stroke. Honda's J30A engine has an bore and stroke. Suzuki AX100 engine has a bore and stroke. Yamaha YBR125 engine has a bore and stroke. =Oversquare or short-stroke engine= An engine is described as oversquare or short-stroke if its cylinders have a greater bore diameter than its stroke length, giving a bore/stroke ratio greater than 1:1. An oversquare engine allows for more and larger valves in the head of the cylinder, higher possible rpm by lowering maximum piston ring speed and lower crank stress due to the lower peak piston acceleration for the same engine speed. Due to the increased piston and head surface area, the heat loss increases as the bore/stroke ratio is increased. Thus an excessively high ratio can lead to a decreased thermal efficiency compared to other engine geometries. Because these characteristics favor higher engine speeds, oversquare engines are often tuned to develop peak torque at a relatively high speed. The large size/width of the combustion chamber at ignition can cause increased inhomogeneity in the air/fuel mixture during combustion, resulting in higher emissions. The reduced stroke length allows for a shorter cylinder and sometimes a shorter connecting rod, generally making oversquare engines less tall but wider than undersquare engines of similar engine displacement. Oversquare engine examples Oversquare engines (a.k.a. \\"short stroke engines\\") are very common, as they allow higher rpm (and thus more power), without excessive piston speed. Examples include both Chevrolet and Ford small-block V8s. The BMW N45 gasoline engine has a bore/stroke ratio of 1.167. Horizontally opposed, also known as \\"Boxer\\" or \\"flat\\", engines typically feature oversquare designs since any increase in stroke length would result in twice the increase in overall engine width. This is particularly so in Subaru‚Äôs front-engine layout, where the steering angle of the front wheels is constrained by the width of the engine. Although oversquare engines have a reputation for being high-strung, low-torque machines, the Subaru EJ181 engine develops peak torque at speeds as low as 3200 rpm. Nissan's RB, VQ, VK, VH and VR38DETT engines are all oversquare. Additionally, SR16VE engine found in Nissan Pulsar VZ-R and VZ-R N1 is an oversquare engine with bore and stroke, giving it but relatively small torque of Extreme oversquare engines are found in Formula One racing cars, where strict rules limit displacement, thereby necessitating that power be achieved through high engine speeds. Stroke ratios approaching 2.5:1 are allowed, enabling engine speeds of 18,000 rpm while remaining reliable for multiple races. The Ducati Panigale motorcycle engine is massively oversquare with a bore/stroke ratio of 1.84:1. It was given the name \\"SuperQuadro\\" by Ducati, roughly translated as \\"super-square\\" from Italian. The side-valve Belgian D-Motor LF26 aero-engine has a bore/stroke ratio of 1.4:1.http://d-motor1.vpweb.be/Price---product-specifications.html Early Mercedes-Benz M116 engines had a bore and a stroke for a 3.5 litre V8.http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/mercedes_350SL_technical_specifications.htm =Undersquare or long-stroke engine= An engine is described as undersquare or long-stroke if its cylinders have a smaller bore (width, diameter) than its stroke (length of piston travel) - giving a ratio value of less than 1:1. At a given engine speed, a longer stroke increases engine friction and increases stress on the crankshaft due to the higher peak piston acceleration. The smaller bore also reduces the area available for valves in the cylinder head, requiring them to be smaller or fewer in number. Undersquare engines exhibit peak torque at lower rpm than an oversquare engine due to their longer crank throw and high piston speed. Undersquare engines have become more common lately, as manufacturers push for more and more efficient engines and higher fuel economy. Undersquare engines have a higher volume/surface area ratio, leading to reduced heat loss and higher BSFC. Undersquare engine examples Many inline engines, particularly those mounted transversely in front-wheel-drive cars, utilize an undersquare design. The smaller bore allows for a shorter engine that increases room available for the front wheels to steer. Examples of this include many Volkswagen, Nissan, Honda, and Mazda engines. The 1KR-FE-engine used in the Toyota Aygo, Citro√´n C1 and Peugeot 107 amongst others is an example of a modern long-stroke engine widely used in FF layout cars. This engine has a bore and stroke of stroke giving it a bore/stroke ratio of 0.845:1. Some rear-wheel-drive cars that borrow engines from front-wheel-drive cars (such as the Mazda MX-5) use an undersquare design. BMW's acclaimed S54B32 engine was undersquare with a bore and stroke of ), offering a world record torque-per-litre figure () for normally- aspirated production engines at the time; this record stood until Ferrari unveiled the 458 Italia. Many British automobile companies used undersquare designs until the 1950s, largely because of a motor tax system that taxed cars by their cylinder bore. This includes the BMC A-Series engine, and many Nissan derivatives. The Trojan Car used an undersquare, split piston, two stroke, two cylinder in line engine; this was partly for this tax advantage and partly because its proportions allowed flexing V-shaped connecting rods for the two pistons of each U-shaped cylinder, which was cheaper and simpler than two connecting rods joined with an additional bearing. The 225 cu in (3.7 litre) Chrysler Slant-6 engine is undersquare, with a bore and stroke of stroke (bore/stroke ratio = 0.819:1). The Ford 5.4L Modular Engine features a bore and stroke of , which makes a bore/stroke ratio of 0.852:1. Since the stroke is significantly longer than the bore, the SOHC 16V (2-valve per cylinder) version of this engine is able to generate a peak torque of 350 lb¬∑ft as low as 2501 rpm. The Willys Jeep L134 and F134 engines were undersquare, with a bore and stroke of stroke (bore/stroke ratio = 0.714:1). The Dodge Power Wagon used a straight-six Chrysler Flathead engine of 230 cu in (3.8 l) with a bore and stroke of , yielding a substantially undersquare bore/stroke ratio of 0.709:1. The 4-litre Barra Inline 6 engine from the Australian Ford Falcon, uses a bore and stroke of stroke, which equates to a 0.929:1 bore-stroke ratio. The 292 Chevrolet I6 is also undersquare, with a bore and stroke of in (bore/stroke ratio = 0.939:1). Mitsubishi's 4G63T engine found primarily in many generations of Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution is an undersquare engine with a bore and stroke of . The Jaguar XK6 engine, used in all 6-cylinder Jaguars from 1949 to 1987 was undersquare. For example, the 4.2 litre engine had a bore and stroke of , providing a bore/stroke ratio of 0.869:1. Virtually all piston engines used in military aircraft were long-stroke engines. The PW R-2800, Wright R-3350, Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major, Rolls-Royce Merlin (1650), Allison V-1710, and Hispano-Suiza 12Y-Z are only a few of more than a hundred examples. All diesel-powered ships have massively undersquare marine engines. A W√§rtsil√§ two-stroke marine diesel engine has a bore and stroke of , (bore/stroke ratio = 0.384:1). While most modern motorcycle engines are square or oversquare, some are undersquare. The Kawasaki Z1300's straight-six engine was made undersquare to minimise engine width, more recently, a new straight- twin engine for the Honda NC700 series used an undersquare design to achieve better combustion efficiency in order to reduce fuel consumption.

Numbered bank accounts are bank accounts wherein the identity of the holder is replaced with a multi-digit number known only to the client and select private bankers. Although these accounts do add another layer of banking secrecy, they are not completely anonymous as the name of the client is still recorded by the bank and is subject to limited, warranted disclosure. During the 1910s, bankers from Switzerland created numbered bank accounts to add a layer of anonymity for European clients seeking to avoid paying World War I taxes. With the passage of the Swiss Banking Law of 1934, this practice proliferated across the banking industry in Switzerland. Some Swiss banks supplement the number with a code name such as \\"Cardinal\\", \\"Octopussy\\" or \\"Cello\\" as an alternative manner to identify the client. However, to open this type of account in Switzerland, clients must pass a multi-stage clearance procedure and prove to the bank the lawful origins of their assets. Banking institutions that have adopted this practice in Europe, Asia, and the Americas also require clients to undergo stringent vetting and provide the identity of the beneficial owner. The usage of fake names to open these accounts is prohibited in Switzerland, the European Union, the United States, and other off-shore financial centers. Many sovereign state governments have outlawed the usage of these accounts as they are commonly associated with a desire by the account holder to either minimize governmental scrutiny or avoid taxation. Most regulations governing the usage of numbered bank accounts require that the holder signs a document and undergoes a background check that confirms who they are and a connection to the account. Despite the regulations, numbered bank accounts by their very nature are more private than normal bank accounts. In Switzerland, for example, bankers are outlawed from disclosing whether or not an account is numbered to any governmental agency unless proof of deliberate fraud is established, not merely the non-reporting of assets in order to avoid taxation.

Overview The museum houses the world‚Äôs largest collection of Worcester porcelain. The collections date back to 1751 and the Victorian gallery, the ceramic collections, archives and records of factory production, form the primary resource for the study of Worcester porcelain and its history. The museum is the only part of Royal Worcester left at the Severn Street site in Worcester after the factory went into administration in 2008 and closed in 2009. The Royal Worcester Visitor Centre, the seconds shop and the cafe all closed with the factory in 2009. The Museum of Royal Worcester was formerly known as the Museum of Worcester Porcelain and the Dyson Perrins Museum and Worcester Porcelain Museum, after Charles William Dyson Perrins of Worcestershire sauce fame. The collections includes pieces from the beginning of porcelain manufacturing in Worcester in 1751 until the closure of the Royal Worcester factory in Worcester. The museum is owned by the Dyson Perrins Museum Trust. Collections The Worcester Porcelain Museum collection is displayed in three permanent galleries: the Georgian Gallery, the Victorian Gallery and the Twentieth Century Gallery. The museum holds over 10,000 objects made between 1751 and 2009. The collections date back to the 18th century, when shapes and patterns were copied from the Far East for use in the homes of the very rich. A display in the first gallery shows an 18th-century furnished room with a long case clock and table laid for dessert. A trio of hexagonal vases feature on the mantle piece in what would have been a gentleman's home. In contrast, the Victorian gallery has deep colours, extravagant exhibition pieces, and works of great craftsmanship. Here it can be seen how travel influenced design and how with the onslaught of the Industrial Revolution more people could afford to buy fine works. The museum tour ends in the 20th century, where as well as producing bespoke services, commissioned by some of the factory's private customers, changing lifestyles and the advent of modern appliances like freezers and microwave ovens required a new range of products. Henry Sandon and Lars Tharp together with others worked on an audio tour for the museum. This together with the facts trail combines to set the historical backdrop and present the technical achievements, the workers who made and decorated the porcelain, and the customers who bought it. Facilities Disability and Access The Museum of Royal Worcester has full wheelchair access throughout the galleries, two lifts and a disabled toilet. Wheelchairs are available for use at the museum. Three hour street parking is available in Severn Street outside the museum for those with a blue badge.

It was a spin-off from the earlier CCG Legend of the Five Rings. Legend of the Burning Sands was set in the same fictional world as Legend of the Five Rings, but with an Arabian setting rather than an Oriental one, with a few characters appearing in both games. Both games had similar mechanics and emphasized a continuing storyline. The first three Legend of the Burning Sands sets were released under FRPG's experimental Rolling Thunder system, which emphasized small, regular releases of cards. The Rolling Thunder distribution mechanism proved to be unpopular, however, so the game was put on hiatus. After six months, the game's massive conclusion set, The Awakening, was released, but interest in the game had already faded significantly. Sales were poor, and most of the stock was destroyed rather than being warehoused. Today, cards from The Awakening are in high demand from collectors. Much like Legend of the Five Rings, LBS included many factions, especially towards the end of the game, where 12 different groups existed: The Ashalan, Ivory Kingdoms, Assassins, Ra'Shari, Senpet, Yodatai, Celestial Alliance, Jackals, Ebonites, Moto, Dahab and Qabal. Revival In 2006, a movement was started to revive LBS at Origins and GenCon. A project was later started to photo document all known cards in the hopes of building standard rules for proxying cards to be able to play. A plugin for the free LackeyCCG engine was also created. It includes all the cards picture, text and rulings, allowing players to enjoy online games of Legends of the Burning Sands without any constraints regarding cards disponibility nor geographical emplacement. In 2012, the game system was revised and implemented in the game \\"Romance of the Nine Empires\\" which was inspired by the movie \\"The Gamers: Hands of Fate.\\" During the movie's Kickstarter campaign, Alderac Entertainment Group promised the game's release as a stretch goal option. Role-Playing Game Alderac Entertainment Group has announced the release of a Legend of the Burning Sands sourcebook for their 3rd Edition Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game. The book, a stand-alone game compatible with L5R, was released in September, 2008. A Fourth edition update was released as a free PDF in 2010.  Expansion set releases  # Shadow of the Tyrant: Released July 1998. 156 cards. # Secrets and Lies: Released October 1998. 104 cards. # Black Hand, Black Heart: Released December 1998. 104 cards. # The Awakening: Released June 1999.

A veteran of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and served as chief disbursing officer and aide to General John J. Pershing during World War I. Stanton was the nephew of Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton.Did They Really Say That? Quotations and Misquotations He is best known for having included the memorable expression \\"Lafayette, we are here!\\" in a speech he gave in Paris during the First World War. Early life Charles E. Stanton was born in Monticello, Illinois on November 22, 1858. As a boy he was raised in part along the roadbed of the Union Pacific Railroad during its construction as part of the First Transcontinental Railroad; his father ran businesses that catered to the construction crews, and was operating the railroad hotel at Promontory, Utah when the railroad was completed in 1869. At the ceremony on Promontory Summit where engines of the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific Railroad touched cowcatchers to symbolize the opening of the transcontinental route, Stanton rode in the UP's engine and rang the engine's bell. Stanton was educated in San Francisco, and then attended Santa Clara University and Yale University. He worked at silver mines in Nevada, farmed in Minnesota, sold mineral water for a company in Idaho, and sold fire extinguishers in San Francisco. He served as Chief Clerk of the Utah Territorial Assembly, and Salt Lake County Clerk. He was a delegate to the Utah constitutional convention which resulted in statehood in 1895. Army career In 1898 Stanton was appointed a paymaster of volunteers in the United States Army with the rank of major. He served in the Philippines during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and after his 1901 discharge accepted a regular Army commission as a captain in the paymaster corps. He continued to serve in the army, and at the start of World War I he was a lieutenant colonel on the staff of John J. Pershing. He served as chief disbursing officer for the American Expeditionary Forces, and received the Distinguished Service Medal and the French Legion of Honor. Stanton retired as a colonel in 1921. Later career After retiring from the army, Stanton served as a member of San Francisco's Board of Public Works. In 1931 he was enrolled in the American Legion as its one millionth member. Stanton died in San Francisco on May 8, 1933. He was buried at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California. Lafayette quote On July 4, 1917, Stanton visited the tomb of French Revolution and American Revolution hero Marquis de Lafayette and (according to Pershing) said, \\"Lafayette, we are here!\\" to honor the nobleman's assistance during the Revolutionary War and assure the French people that the people of the United States would aid them in World War I. The famous quote is often misattributed to Pershing.George 104. In context, he said: > America has joined forces with the Allied Powers, and what we have of blood > and treasure are yours. Therefore it is that with loving pride we drape the > colors in tribute of respect to this citizen of your great republic. And > here and now, in the presence of the illustrious dead, we pledge our hearts > and our honor in carrying this war to a successful issue. Lafayette, we are > here.Charles E.

Credit counseling is most often done by Credit counseling agencies that are empowered by contract to act on behalf of the debtor to negotiate with creditors to resolve debt that is beyond a debtor's ability to pay. Some of the agencies are non-profits that charge at no or non-fee rates, while others can be for-profit and include high fees. Regulations on credit counseling and Credit counseling agencies varies by country and sometimes within regions of the countries themselves. In the United States, individuals filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy are required to receive counseling. Overview In the United States, the National Foundation for Credit Counseling was established in 1951. The modern practice known as ‚Äò‚Äòcredit counseling‚Äô‚Äô was initiated by creditor banks and credit card companies during the mid-1960s to address the growing volume of personal bankruptcies. Although there is variation from country to country and even in regions within country, consumer debt is primarily made up of home loans, credit card debt and car loans. Credit counseling includes an array of services to address consumer debt that is not within the debtor's ability to pay, such as education about credi personal finance, budgeting and debt management. In addition to education, a popular credit counseling option is the ‚Äò‚ÄòDebt management plan‚Äô‚Äô (‚Äò‚ÄòDMP‚Äô‚Äô, known in the United Kingdom as the Individual voluntary arrangement or \\"IVA\\"). In order to initiate a DMP, a consumer would authorize the credit counselor to contact each of the consumer‚Äôs unsecured creditors and negotiate with each creditor to lower the consumer‚Äôs monthly payment amount, to lower the interest rate, and to waive any outstanding late fees. The debt was then ‚Äò‚Äòconsolidated‚Äô‚Äô into a single payment. Credit counselors can sometimes negotiate debt relief, where part or whole of an individual debt is forgiven. Another option is Debt consolidation, in which one new loan replaces multiple unsecured credit debts. The Debt- snowball method is a budgeting approach that addresses debt systematically. Criticism Global criticism of credit counseling comes primarily from predatory practices that take advantage of debtors that are already struggling. These practices include failing to meet required standards, charging unlawful or unreasonable fees, failing to provide affordable solutions for consumers, and neglecting to make customers aware of free debt services available elsewhere. Regulations by country =United States= In the United States, Credit counseling agencies are loosely regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation‚Äôs consumer protection agency, which can sue companies that have deceived consumers about the cost, nature, or benefits of their services. Different states may regulate DMPs individually and Attorneys General are empowered to protect state citizens from fraud. Two professional associations represent Credit counselors: the National Foundation for Credit Counseling and the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority is responsible for the regulation of consumer credit and has established a Debt Management Plan Protocol. It can impose fines for improper conduct. =European Union= Elsewhere in the European Union, regulation and non-regulation of Credit counseling agencies and their approaches, including DMPs, are widely varied. In Sweden, guidelines for credit counseling are loosely provided by the Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees (TCO) and creditors are encouraged to use them in lieu of the court system. In Ireland, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) provides debt resolution information directly to debtors. In Latvia, a debt advisory company called LAKRA works with employers to assist indebted employees. =Canada= The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) advises Canadians to do their research and find a trustworthy organization and a qualified counsellor. They suggest making sure an agency is in good standing with a provincial or national association. They recommend looking carefully at the agency's advertising to see if it sounds too good to be true. Claims or misrepresentations to look out for can include repaying only a fraction of your debt, quickly fixing your credit score, or claiming to be part of a government program. They also suggest consumers inquire about an agency's services, costs, and counsellor qualifications. The FCAC has also warns Canadians to be careful of companies offering to help them pay off their debt or repair their credit. Things to watch out for include guarantees to solve debt problems and using high interest loans to pay off debt. Some of these companies also claim that they can file a consumer proposal on behalf of a consumer. However, the FCAC points out that only a qualified licensed insolvency trustee can help someone with a consumer proposal or bankruptcy. =South Africa= The National Credit Regulator (NCR) was established as the regulator under the National Credit Act No. 34 of 2005 (The Act) and is responsible for the regulation of the South African credit industry. It is tasked with carrying out education, research, policy development, registration of industry participants, investigation of complaints, and ensuring the enforcement of the Act. The NCR is also tasked with the registration of credit providers, credit bureau and debt counsellors; and with the enforcement of compliance with the Act. Debt Counselling was introduced and enforced in 2007. This enabled over-indebted consumers to seek relief in accordance to the National Credit Act (NCA). The NCA has been amended several times since inception and various new regulations published.

The institution was founded in 1848 as the South Wales and Monmouthshire Training College, a teacher-training college. It changed its name in 1931 to Trinity College, Carmarthen; and in 2009 to Trinity University College. In 2010, it merged with the University of Wales, Lampeter to become the new University of Wales Trinity Saint David. History Trinity University College began life in 1848 as the South Wales and Monmouthshire Training College, making it the oldest teacher training college in continuous operation in Wales. The college's role was to train young men for teaching in Church primary schools. In the first year of operation, 22 students were recruited and were taught by three members of staff including the first Principal, William Reed. Walter Powell is recorded as the first student; he was 17, previously a draper and worked in a grocery store. The College required its students to follow a strict schedule which included getting up at half past six for a cold bath. Students were often recruited from humble backgrounds, and to remind them of this, the college curriculum included subjects such as gardening and woodwork. The students were expected to have a knowledge of grammar and arithmetic and received education in Latin and Greek. By 1936, the college also had an art block and a gym. The college also placed restrictions on interaction with the local townspeople, particularly women, and fines were issued for \\"girling\\" (interacting with local women). The strict regime of college life was however broken for activities such as smoking and reading newspapers in the common rooms, musical concerts and entertainment. In the late Victorian era, photography became a great hobby at the college. In the inter-war and post-war era, the college gained a strong reputation for sports. The principal sport played was rugby, in which many students went on to achieve considerable success; but other sports included badminton, tennis and hockey. An account of college life in the 1930s is provided by ex-student George Head, who wrote that the Old Building and the Dewi Hostel combined contained all of the teaching rooms, a gymnasium, the library, the smoking room and common rooms, the secretarial offices, and the \\"Sick Ward\\" and medical facilities. Church was still at this period a large part of the college life. Interaction with women was still forbidden and punishable. Head does however speak of how fond the students were of the college and how much they took away from it. In particular he recounts the old Trinity College Anthem titled \\"There is a tavern in the town\\". During the Second World War many students were expected to take \\"fire watches\\" and serve as lookouts at night, although this job came with little danger in a town like Carmarthen. Many of the students at the college also joined the Home Guard and took part in drills. In 1938 a Broadcast room was constructed, the foundation stone being laid by the Duke of Kent. In 1931, the College changed its name to Trinity College, Carmarthen. Female students were first admitted in 1957. In 2009, the College achieved \\"university college\\" status, and changed its name to Trinity University College. =College anthem= =Merger with University of Wales Lampeter= On 14 December 2008, it was announced that Trinity was in merger talks with Lampeter with the intention of forming a new university in Wales. The decision was taken in April 2009 for the merger to go ahead. The name for the newly merged institution would be University of Wales Trinity Saint David. The Welsh Assembly Government announced a ¬£14.03m investment in the newly merged institution in October 2008. The merger formally took place in July 2010.the Gov Monitor ‚Äì West Wales to invest ¬£14.3 into higher learning Trinity College, Carmarthen Location Trinity College is situated on the outskirts of Carmarthen. It is in a rural setting, surrounded by fields and hills, but is within 10 minutes walk of the town centre. The University is situated around the original Old College of 1848 and is a mixture of lawns and gardens surrounding modern buildings. The main bulk of the university lies along College Road and Job's Well Road, with some buildings situated away from the main grounds. On the outskirts of the town, near the town leisure centre there is the university's outdoor weather pitch. These facilities were inherited by the new university and continue in use today. Buildings =Original buildings= Old Building The campus is centred on the original 1848 Old Building of Trinity College. It originally contained all of the original dormitories, common rooms, libraries, an original university quadrangle and teaching spaces. The building today houses several lecture theatres and smaller classrooms often used by the University's school of Justice and Social Inclusion (including Psychology) and, Theology, Religious Studies and Islamic Studies. Picture of Old Building Carmarthen Another feature of the old building of Carmarthen is the Archbishop Childs' hall. Named after Derrick Greenslade Childs, who was Archbishop of Wales, Bishop of Monmouth and director of the Church in Wales. Childs was principal of Trinity from 1965 and died in 1987 shortly after his retirement. The hall is of a classical shape and is hung with framed paintings of Childs. The hall is today used as a venue for conferences, lectures and performances (it contains a grand piano). On the outside of the building, there is a carved crest of the Bishops of Wales. Childs is also commemorated by an upper room in the old building named Archbishop Childs Room. Cwad The original 1848 quadrangle has been modified and renamed the \\"Cwad\\". This comprises a collection of computer suites and study rooms as well as a coffee shop located in the Old Library which serves Starbucks coffee and small meals. This area is also home to the University shop which sells daily essentials for learning. Chapel Trinity University College Carmarthen, Chapel building exterior Attached to the main body of the building is the University Chapel. This space is divided into 3 areas; the main chapel, the ante-chapel and the chaplaincy lounge. The Main chapel is an extension added in 1932, it retains many of its original features such as a large pipe organ and several stained glass features. The ante-chapel is the original 1848 chapel, now dedicated to past students and lecturers who served during the First World War. It has a central font and is decorated with student artwork. Connected to this is the Chaplaincy lounge. This space serves as a comfortable relaxed meeting space for students. It also houses the chaplaincy library, a small collection of literature serving needs of the chapel and its congregation. =Later additions= Halliwell Centre The Halliwell Centre was the College's main conference facility. It is named after Rev. Dr. Thomas Halliwell LL.D. M.A., a former lecturer and principal of the college. The building comprised several large lecture halls, smaller conference rooms and suites, a larger conference hall complete with bar facilities and the Halliwell Theatre, which regularly hosted shows by travelling companies and the universities acclaimed performing arts students. The facilities of the Halliwell were often used by the various schools of the college for lectures and larger seminars. Beneath the main complex were also several more lecture rooms and the drama department. The Halliwell Centre also housed the Merlin restaurant, which was the main refectory for catered students. Halliwell Building, Trinity University College Carmarthen Carwyn James Building This building was named after Carwyn James, a rugby player and former lecturer of the college. This facility was home to the Faculty of Education and Training. It was used to teach degrees such as primary education and its interior was designed to resemble that of a school building. On the second floor of the building, overlooking the quadrangle was the college's 'Quiet Study Facility' which allowed students a comfortable space to work in peace. Emyr Wyn Evans Building This building housed office space, music suites and practice rooms for the School of Performing Arts. Adjoining this building was the School's main workshop for the degree of theatre production and design. Dewi Building The Dewi building was originally built in 1925 as the Dewi Hostel. It was an extension of the original old college and served as an extra wing for student accommodation. An account of the conditions of the hostel survives from a student living in them at the time: \\"To keep oneself warm in the new wing during the Winter months was a problem for although it had a system of heating, the heat seldom reached even the second floor. To wash we depended on the rain-water caught in the roof of the building and this was always cold\\". In 2010 the building was refurbished and modernised, primarily as office space. It contained the university's main reception, finance office and registry as well as IT facilities which were sometimes used by the School of Business and Tourism. Students' Union The Students' Union building was the centre of student social life on the campus. Constructed in 1972 it comprised two main venues: the Attic Bar which served food and drinks, and downstairs \\"Unity\\", the main entertainment venue of the Union. This facility hosted club nights as well as other social events. The Union incorporated many societies, ranging from sports such as rugby and hockey to historical societies. Learning Resources Centre The main library of the campus was constructed in 1995 to accommodate resources for the growing diversity of subjects studied, and was located opposite the Parry Block. It was dedicated to the poet Raymond Garlick, who was a principal lecturer in Trinity's Welsh Department. It contained a total of 110,000 books along with academic journals and DVDs. It also housed public computers, printing and photocopying facilities. The first floor contained the bulk of the main collection as well as specialist collections, IT spaces and larger collections. The second floor contained quieter working spaces and the rest of the main collection. Parry Block Named after Canon Parry, a former head of the college, the Parry Block contained a variety of teaching facilities which were used largely by the University's School of Justice and Social inclusion and School of Creative Arts. These included large classrooms and smaller art studios. Norah Isaac Named after Norah Isaac, a former lecturer and important figure in Welsh drama, this building had a selection of classrooms and lecture suites. Degrees in English and Creative Writing were also taught in this building. It was located directly opposite the Parry Building. Robert Hunter Named after Robert Hunter, this building contained laboratories, classrooms and lecture halls used by the School of Sport, Health and Outdoor Education. The facility was located near the Myrddin Accommodation blocks, and was surrounded by picturesque gardens and ponds. Dafydd Rowlands Named after the author Dafydd Rowlands, this building was the hub of the School of Film and Visual Media. It was used by many of the creative arts degrees and contained lecture rooms, crafting spaces and an office space for the School of Visual Media. Student life =Student Union= The students' union building at the college was constructed in 1972 for the purposes of serving the growing number of students deciding to live on campus. It was a large building, complete with a club called Unity and the Attic Bar. Trinity had several sporting and academic societies and clubs run by the union. The university college also had a Christian Union and Amnesty groups. Accommodation Archbishop Noakes Hall of Residence *Archbishop Noakes Hall: this was a large accommodation facility that was split into three sections. It could house hundreds of students and was reserved for returning students. The Blocks were all self catered, each room is en-suite, and are divided into flats of eight with one kitchen per flat. * Myrddin Hall: this was a catered first year hall, built in the late 1960s to accommodate growing numbers of students. The Halls had shared common room space and shared bathrooms. * Non Hall: originally built in 1957 opposite the old Dewi Hostel to accommodate the first female students. The building had similar facilities to the Myrddin Halls. It remained a single-sex, female block up until the merger, and was reserved for first year catered students. * Tower Hall: this too was a first year catered block. It was 10 storeys tall and could accommodate many students. * Picton Hall: Situated on Picton Terrace by the junction with Picton Place, this was used during the 1990s as accommodation for male students. It comprised three Georgian houses, two of which were joined. Picton residents ate their meals on campus in the canteen. During the late 1990s the hall was unsupervised by a warden and was in poor repair. The buildings are no longer part of the University. The college could accommodate 600 of its students, though many elected to live in private accommodation in town. Sports Trinity had a long history of sport and from its very beginnings sport played an important role in students' life. Rugby was an important and strong tradition at Trinity and many of its alumni went on to become very successful in the sport. =Facilities= Shortly before the merger, the college had a fully equipped gymnasium and sports hall. It had a climbing wall, a swimming pool, tennis courts and an astroturf. It also had large playing fields and an all-weather pitch near the town leisure centre. Sport was also studied academically through the Schools of Nutrition Health and Exercise and Sport, Health and Outdoor Education. Performing arts The campus' general workshop and costume workshops were used by students of theatre design. Venues for theatrical performances included a tiered theatre in the Halliwell Centre, a 160-seat facility with a sprung floor which could be used for dance rehearsals, Theatr Parry, and Theatr Fach (which contained a green screen and was used as a recording studio). Creative arts The college housed workshops designed for different arts and crafts such as woodwork, fine art and ceramics. There were also modern media suites which allowed students to engage with 2D and 3D moving artwork and an Apple Mac lab equipped with dual core i-Macs, as well as Mac Pro towers to enable students to have an industry standard experience. In addition, the campus was home to the \\"final cut\\" film studio and recording and editing studios used by Film and Media students. Courses Historically, Trinity College was primarily concerned with the discipline of teacher training. It had a long and constant history with the subject.

Convoy HX 106 was intercepted, but the attack was aborted when the escorting battleship was spotted. L√ºtjens had orders to avoid action with enemy capital ships. The British failed to make an accurate identification of the German battleships. After refuelling, the German ships missed convoy HX 111, but happened upon an empty convoy returning to the U.S. Over 12 hours, five ships were sunk but the attack was reported. The squadron moved south to the Azores to intercept the convoy route between West Africa and Britain. A convoy was sighted but, once again, was not attacked due to the presence of the battleship . Instead, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau shadowed it, acting to guide in U-boat attacks. The two ships moved back to the western Atlantic, sinking a solitary freighter en route.

The school was then operated by Dr Barnardo's until its closure in 1953. History =Norfolk County School= Norfolk County School stood on the summit of a wooded hill with excellent views across the Wensum Valley near the village of North Elmham. It was surrounded by of land in Bintry parish in the Bintry (or Bintree as it is sometimes written) Hills. Norfolk County School was a public school was founded by Prebendary Joseph Lloyd Brereton to serve the educational needs of the sons of farmers & artisans as part of his experiment in County Education. The foundation stone was laid on Easter Monday 1873 by Edward Prince of Wales (later to become King Edward VII). The school opened in 1874. The school also had an open-air swimming pool.Watts Naval Training School The property consisted of a central building, with a Principal's House attached to the north end of the building. A laundry was provided at the south end of the intersection. At the north end of the fifty- four acre site was a gardener's cottage. The western boundary of the property was marked by the River Wensum, and an open-air 70 ft by 30 ft swimming bath was provided next to the river. A boat house owned by the school also stood on the banks of the river, and a cricket ground was provided on the eastern side of the main building. A chapel, built of Bath stone, was erected in 1883 and consecrated on 16 October that year. In 1884 Brereton succeeded in getting railway access to the school through the County School railway station built at the foot of the hill. Despite the improved communications, the school roll never reached the 300 for which it was designed, partly as a result of the depression in agriculture. =Watts Naval School= The school was closed in July 1895. On 4 June 1901 its premises were sold to Edmund Hannay Watts. Following his death, his eldest son, Fenwick Shadforth Watts, had the fabric of the building renovated and furnished, at a cost of several thousand pounds, before handing it over to Dr Barnardo's Homes. As a result, it was turned into a home for up to 300 orphans and destitute boys under the charge of Dr T. J. Barnardo and was opened informally on 9 March 1903.Barnardo's homes ‚Äì East Anglia ‚Äì Watts Naval Training School The establishment was then used for the training of selected Barnardo's boys for a life at sea in the Royal Navy or mercantile Marine. The school was opened on 17 April 1906, by Viscount Coke, later Earl of Leicester.Watts Naval School It was classified as a Secondary Technical School, with the technical instruction being nautical and with musical training for boys intending on being enlisted in the Royal Marines or other military bands. The first Captain of the school was Commander H. C. Martin, a former captain of the training ship Warspite, working with a staff of fifteen. The Rector of Kettlestone was appointed as Honorary Chaplain, and medical care was provided by Dr Rackham from North Elmham. Initially only one hundred boys were sent to the school, with the remaining two hundred arriving in batches of fifty to assist with the establishment of naval discipline. The building was only slightly altered from its former use as a public school. The central hall was fitted with a heavy glass roof, and a fire escape was added to the eastern side of the building, allowing it to be evacuated within three minutes. Every part of the school was heated with hot water and an acetylene gas supply was installed. The central hall, classrooms, reception rooms and staff rooms were on the ground floor. The first floor was used for staff bedrooms, boys' dormitories, linen and the storage of dry goods. The third floor included the dining hall, kitchens, dining rooms and more dormitories. The bathrooms, engine room (boilers) and offices were located in the basement. The school was also provided with an isolation hospital, built in the grounds. The boys were woken at 6.30am, after which they attended morning prayers before having breakfast at 7.30am. At 9.00am they would go to the central hall and fall in for inspection by the Captain, before marching off for lessons and drill. Dinner was served at 12.30pm, with the boys falling in for more school and drill at 2.00pm. At 4.00pm they had a half-hour's special drill training. Tea was served at 5.30pm, with evening prayers and bed two hours later. The chapel was enlarged in 1926, when transepts were added. It seated all three hundred boys and the school's masters. The pulpit was given as a memorial to B. Watson, Esq, and two stained glass windows were added in memory of Frederick Humby, an old Watts boy who lost his life in the Titanic sinking of 1912. =Closure= The school was closed in 1953,Watts Naval School/ when the remaining boys were transferred to other Barnardo's training ship establishments, mostly on the south coast. Old boys concerned about the chapel were assured that Barnardo's Clerical Organising Secretary, working with the Bishop of Norwich, would be making arrangements for its preservation and that the relocation of the memorial tablets and windows was being considered. =Today= The main school building was demolished and its site was returned to grass, apart from the captains 5 bedroom house which is the last remainders of the school. The rest became a chicken farm, but after the closure of the poultry operation a number of six-bedroom houses were built on the site. The chapel survives as a private residence, after some years of being used as a piggery. Some of the other school buildings are still in ruins, although most have been renovated and restored to domestic use. The chapel memorial windows were removed by Barnardo's. In 1978 they were sold at auction and are now in private hands in the United States. Notable old boys * Captain Frank Beck, King Edward VII land agent in its public school days. *Fred Copeman OBE.

It usually is an expression of the congregation's charism and particular insertion in the apostolic field of the Church.  In the Society of Jesus  After a period of service as a priest, members of the Society of Jesus‚Äîreferred to as Jesuits‚Äîcan be allowed to take a fourth vow of obedience to the pope with regard to the missions. The text of the vow is : ¬´ (...) I further promise a special obedience to the sovereign pontiff in regard to the missions, according to the same Apostolic Letters and the Constitutions¬ª. (Constitutions S.J., N¬∞527). The same text is being used today, just as it was in the days of Ignatius of Loyola. The vow is an expression of a strong attachment the Jesuits have for the Church, and their willingness to accept whatever service the Church asks (through the pope) if it is of a great apostolic need. In part VII of the Constitutions, discussing the 'distribution of the members in the Vineyard of the lord' the founding fathers explain the purpose of the fourth vow: ¬´Those who first united to form the Society were from different provinces and realms and did not know into which regions they were to go, whether among the faithful or the unbelievers; and therefore to avoid erring in the path of the Lord, they made that promise or vow in order that His Holiness might distribute them for greater glory to God¬ª [Constitutions S.J., N¬∞606] This vow is limited to the priests of the Society. Only those who have been accepted by the Society to take this vow may serve as major superiors in the Society of Jesus.  In other religious institutes  Other religious institutes have adopted the practice of taking a fourth vow; the Religious Sisters of Mercy, for example, take a fourth vow of service to the poor, sick, and ignorant and the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate take a fourth vow of devotion to Mary. The Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy requires that its members take a fourth vow, a vow to die for another who is in danger of losing their faith. A fourth vow of the Missionaries of Christ Jesus was suppressed in 1969.

The station is located at the end of one of the branches of the Wirral Line, part of the Merseyrail network, and is the westernmost terminal on the Wirral Line. There is a central island platform between two terminus tracks, and two parallel sidings for out-of-use electric trains. The beach can be reached easily from the station. A second station, terminal to a rail link to Hooton, lay to the east of the Wirral Line station, but closed in 1962. History =Wirral line= In 1873, the Hoylake and Birkenhead Railway was authorised to construct two extensions to its lines. One was a short connecting section near to Birkenhead docks, and the other was the extension from Hoylake to West Kirby. The station and the extension were opened on 1 April 1878 as the terminus of the Wirral Railway's route from Birkenhead Park station. The station's original signal box was built in 1886, to a London and North Western Railway (LNWR) design. This signal box was removed and replaced in 1932. After the opening of the Mersey Railway Tunnel in 1886, carriages were operated through Birkenhead Park, every half-hour, all the way to James Street station in Liverpool. As traffic increased, the line into West Kirby was doubled, from a single track, in 1896. After a board meeting on 28 October 1895, it was decided to extend the line from Hooton, into West Kirby. The station was relocated on the western side of the original station, with an enlarged island platform and rebuilt, in 1898‚Äì9, in red brick, with a turreted clock tower and mock Tudor frontage. A further platform was constructed for the Hooton line, on the eastern side of the original station. The site of the original station was used for goods sidings. In the present day, this is the site of The Concourse, a community building operated by Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council. In 1932, the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) constructed a new signal cabin, used jointly with the Great Western Railway (GWR), which was installed on the western side of the tracks, just beyond the end of the platform. This replaced the earlier signal box in the same place. This signal box was closed on 17 September 1994 and demolished a week later. There was an active freight depot, until 1964, on the eastern side of the station. The freight depot occupied the triangular area between the former Wirral Railway station, which received the electrified lines, and the former Birkenhead Joint branch station. The depot was mainly used to receive coal for domestic distribution. The area occupied by the freight depot was later used for the construction of The Concourse. The West Kirby goods depot was principally served by a daily goods train along the electric line from Birkenhead, which also served goods depots at Hoylake, Moreton, and the Cadbury's factory near Leasowe. =West Kirby to Hooton line= A 1903 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing (centre) railways in the vicinity of West Kirby (present station on left; C&BR; station on right) West Kirby's station for trains from Hooton opened on 19 April 1886 when the Chester and Birkenhead Railway (C&BR;) extended their line to West Kirby from Parkgate. This now meant there was a direct route from Hooton to West Kirby. The station for the Hooton line was to the east of the current station. The station was along the alignment of what is now Orrysdale Road, between Bridge Road and Grange Road, and was equipped with a small turntable. The station was single-platformed, and a single-storey building provided passenger and parcels facilities. The station also had steam locomotive watering facilities at the southern end of the platform, and a passing loop. The only significant train along this route was a once-daily through service, often just one or two coaches, which ran until 1939. This service was from New Brighton, via Bidston, to Hooton and Chester. The coaches were then attached to a London Euston train. A principal traffic was scholars travelling from stations along the route to the secondary schools in West Kirby. The Birkenhead Joint branch station was effectively a separate facility to the main station on the electric lines. There was a junction between the two lines, underneath the Bridge Road overbridge. However, very few train movements connected between them. In its final years, the almost-unused line was employed for the training of diesel multiple unit crews operating from Birkenhead and Chester via Hooton. The station closed to passengers on 17 September 1956, and closed completely on 7 May 1962. The station site is now the location for several civic buildings, and the route all the way to Hooton is now a footpath, known as The Wirral Way, which forms part of the Wirral Country Park. =LMS electrification= One of the original 1938 LMS electric trains at the platform, at West Kirby, in 1982, during the BR era. The two others, of similar design, were built in 1956. Beneath the Art Deco platform canopy, which was installed in 1938. Through electric services commenced on 13 March 1938, when the LMS electrified the lines from Birkenhead Park to West Kirby. The service was provided by the then-new LMS electric multiple units. However, on Sunday mornings, the service was provided by the older Mersey Railway electric units which, up until that point, had only ever run from Liverpool to Birkenhead Park. The concrete platform awning was erected, at the time of the 1938 electrification, along with a similar structure at New Brighton. However, the station building, across the end of the tracks, was left untouched from Victorian times. =Service disruptions= When the Open Golf Championship was held at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, which is situated between West Kirby and Hoylake, in July 2006, services terminated at Hoylake station during the tournament. This was to allow competitors to cross the tracks from the practice course on one side to the championship course on the other. This caused some controversy locally, especially given the large increase in passengers during the championship. During the Wirral Loop Line track renewal project 2017, trains ran to Birkenhead North or Liverpool James Street stations during different sections of the project. Passengers could then transfer to the appropriate rail replacement bus services to their destinations. Service frequency was reduced to one train every half-hour during this period.http://www.merseyrail.org/wirral-track-renewal.aspx Facilities West Kirby station sign The station has a booking office and a drop-off point for cars, with a cycle rack for 16 bicycles and secure storage for 10 bicycles. The station is staffed, at all times during opening hours, has departure and arrival screens for passenger information, and platform CCTV. The terminus island platform has open-air seating, beneath a platform canopy, and there are two payphones on the platform. Wheelchair and pram access to the platform is straightforward, with no steps to ascend. Much of the station building has been rented out as retail units, accessed from the public road rather than from the railway premises. Services Current services are every 15 minutes (Monday to Saturday daytime) to Liverpool. At other times, trains operate every 30 minutes. These services are all provided by Merseyrail's fleet of Class 507 and Class 508 EMUs. These trains from the late '70s will be replaced by the end of 2020 by new trains manufactured by Stadler Rail, as was announced by Merseyrail in January 2017.

The line's route is from the large Edge Hill rail junction in the east of Liverpool to Seaforth Dock to the north. The line was originally built by the London and North Western Railway terminating at Canada Dock, with a later branch extension added to Alexandra Dock and links onto the MDHC railway lines. The line is not electrified. History The line opened in 1866 between Edge Hill and Canada Dock. Passenger trains ran on the line to Canada Dock from 1870. The initial stations were: Canada Dock, Walton & Anfield, Breck Road, Tue Brook, Stanley and Edge Lane. On 5 September 1881 a sub-branch to Alexandra Dock was opened from the main branch at Atlantic Junction. The branch was in a cutting to the south west of Kirkdale Station. This added the Alexandra Dock and Bootle Balliol Road stations to the line. A further station as added in 1882 at County Road named Spellow. On 1 May 1886 a junction with the Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway was opened from the Alexandra Branch.http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/s/spellow/index.shtml By 31 May 1948 all the passenger stations on the line closed. The line continued to be used by regular Southport to Liverpool Lime Street services, which operated primarily to provide a convenient Southport connection to long haul mainline trains. The service was withdrawn in October 1977.\\"Disused Stations - Spellow\\" Disused Stations Site Record A new Merseyrail underground station below the mainline Lime Street station gave access from Southport via the Merseyrail Northern Line and Wirral Line. A planned extension to Hornby and Gladstone Docks was abandoned in September 1973, however the extension was built and opened in September 1985 for the transport of grain and coal. Today The line is currently a freight-only diesel-traction line and is sometimes referred to as the Bootle Branch or Seaforth Container Terminal Branch (SCT) providing the sole remaining rail connection to the Port of Liverpool. The Olive Mount chord at Edge Hill junction was re-opened in December 2008, approximately doubling the Canada Dock branch's throughput of freight from the Port of Liverpool to the West Coast Main Line. The reinstatement of the chord was essential for existing port operations, ready for the increase in freight when the Post-Panamax, Liverpool2 container terminal was completed at Seaforth Dock. The container terminal can berth the world's largest container ships, transporting up to 14,000 containers per ship. Biomass wood pellets are imported into Liverpool and delivered to the Drax power station in Yorkshire via the rail link. The service started in 2015 with four trains a day, each carrying 25 wagons containing approximately of biomass pellets. A thrice-weekly rail link between the Port of Liverpool and the Mossend terminal in Glasgow was set up in 2018. It is expected that each trip will consist of about 40 containers. The future =Freight use= In May 2016 it was announced that the line's final section into the dock estate would be upgraded to double track from single track to increase capacity to the port. Combined with improved signalling at Earlestown, the improvements will enable up to 48 trains a day to enter the port. Work on the line is expected to be completed by 2019.\\"Rail upgrades promised as part of Port of Liverpool developments\\"Rail Technology Magazine article, 16 May 2016 Peel Ports announced in September 2017 that they were planning on linking the port to the national rail network with a new rail service. Home bargain store B&M; Bargains have expressed an interest in the new rail service, claiming that they have already saved the equivalent of 4 million road miles by using the Port of Liverpool. =Passenger use= The Department for Transport's Rail electrification document of July 2009, states that the route to Liverpool Docks will be electrified. The Canada Dock Branch Line is the only line into the docks. From the document: :70. Electrification of this route will offer electric haulage options for freight. :There will be an alternative route to Liverpool docks for electrically-operated freight trains, and better opportunities of electrified access to the proposed freight terminal at Parkside near Newton-le-Willows. The electrification of this branch line would greatly assist in recommissioning passenger trains, as costs would be reduced. The Route Utilisation Strategy document makes note of the benefits of dual- voltage Electric multiple unit trains, which can be utilised on both the third rail Merseyrail network and future electrified lines which are likely to use overhead wires. There is also a serious suggestion to introduce passenger services on this line in the Local Transport Plan for Merseyside. This was again mentioned in Merseytravel's 30-year plan of 2014. The October 2017 Liverpool City Region Combined Authority update to the Long Term Rail Strategy mentions the re-opening of the line to passenger use with new stations at Anfield, Tue Brook and Edge Lane. The expansion of Liverpool FC's Anfield stadium has led to repeated calls to open the line to passengers and the building of a station to serve the stadium and the Anfield area. It was announced in December 2019 that Liverpool City Council had commissioned a feasibility study to see about reopening the Canada Dock Branch to passenger traffic.

He was one of four children of Felicien Nouveau (1826‚Äì1884) and Marie Silvy (1832‚Äì1858). His mother died before he was seven years old, and he was raised by his grandfather. He spent most of his childhood at Aix-en- Provence, and he moved to Paris in the fall of 1872. =Early career= In Paris in 1872 he published his first poem, \\"Sonnet of Summer,\\" and he discovered the work of poets Paul Verlaine and the teenage prodigy Arthur Rimbaud. At the end of 1873, he met Rimbaud in person, and together they went to England in March, 1874. He lived with Rimbaud in London at 178 Stamford Street before returning to Paris alone three months later. =Mid-career, travel, and mental illness= Nouveau travelled to Belgium and the Netherlands, and in 1875 in Brussels he received from Verlaine the manuscript of Rimbaud's Illuminations. He returned to London where he met Verlaine, who became a long-time friend. In 1878, Nouveau contributed to the French periodicals Le Gaulois and Le Figaro under the pseudonym Jean de Noves (one of many noms de plume he used), before travelling to Beirut in 1883. When he returned home, he taught in a lycee in Paris before being struck by a mysterious mental illness in 1891 and spending several months in a mental hospital. =Religious conversion and pilgrimage= After his mental breakdown, Nouveau voluntarily embarked upon a life of poverty, modelling himself after Saint Beno√Æt-Joseph Labre.

It was completed in 1543 for Francis I of France, from models that had been prepared many years earlier for Cardinal Ippolito d'Este. The cellar is the only remaining work of precious metal which can be reliably attributed to Cellini. It was created in the Mannerist style of the late Renaissance and allegorically portrays Terra e Mare (Land and Sea). In Cellini's description, the sea was represented by a male figure reclining beside a ship for holding the salt; the earth he \\"fashioned like a woman\\" and placed a temple near her to serve as a receptacle for pepper. The salt cellar is made of ivory, rolled gold, and vitreous enamel. The gold is not cast in a mould but hammered by hand into its delicate shape. It stands about 26 cm tall. The base is about 33.5 cm wide and features bearings to roll it around. It came into the possession of the Habsburgs as a gift by Charles IX of France to Archduke Ferdinand II of Tyrol, who had acted as a proxy for Charles in his wedding to Elisabeth of Austria. It was originally part of the Habsburg art collection at Castle Ambras, but was transferred to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna during the 19th century. Theft and recovery On 11 May 2003, the cellar was stolen from the Kunsthistorisches Museum, which was covered by scaffolding at that time due to reconstruction works. The thief set off the alarms, but these were ignored as false, and the theft remained undiscovered until 8:20 am. The museum offered a reward of ‚Ç¨1,000,000 for its recovery.

In 1316 Wilmcote is called a hamlet of Aston Cantlow, and Laurence Hastings, who succeeded as Earl of Pembroke in 1325, is said to have given the manor of GREAT WILMCOTE to John son of John de Wyncote. During the Black Death (1348‚Äì9) Sir John, Eleanor and Joan, and three of the daughters died; and the last of the daughters, Elizabeth, whose wardship had come to the Crown as guardian of the young Earl of Pembroke, died in 1350. No more is known of the manor until 1561, when an estate described as the manor of Great Wilmcote, including Mary Arden's house and land in Shelfield, was granted by Thomas Fynderne of Nuneaton to Adam Palmer of Aston Cantlow and George Gibbs of Wilmcote. Palmer and Gibbs held jointly until 1575, when a partition was made. The descent of Palmer's portion is not known, but Gibbs's, which included Mary Arden's house, remained in the family until another George Gibbs sold it to Matthew Walford of Claverdon in 1704. Walford's son and heir, also Matthew, married Elizabeth Jones and died in 1729, leaving his estates to be held jointly by his five daughters. Whatever manorial rights may have attached to this property had by now disappeared. At the time of the Inclosure in 1742‚Äì3 the manor of Wilmcote was included in that of Aston Cantlow, and Elizabeth Walford, widow, appears in the Award only as the proprietor of 5 yard-lands in the common field.'Aston Cantlow', A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 3: Barlichway hundred (1945), pp. 31‚Äì42. http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56977 Economy The Croft Wilmcote contains areas of good limestone, and a significant quarrying industry grew up in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, particularly after the opening of the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal in 1816 which was routed through Wilmcote because of its quarries. Today the area has many small disused quarries, mostly filled in, and just-visible paths of tramways linking them to the canal. A larger quarry, which has not been filled in, is now a nature reserve. There are remains of lime kilns, built to turn the limestone into cement. Wilmcote stone splits well into sheets and was used for paving as well as for building. It was used for paving the floors in the United Kingdom Houses of Parliament when these were rebuilt in the nineteenth century. The last of the quarries closed in the early twentieth century, but they have left a great legacy for the village. There are several rows of former quarry workers cottages, built in Wilmcote stone, and a pub called the Masons' Arms. The quarries were among the reasons why the canal and railway were routed through Wilmcote. The first Wilmcote railway station opened in 1860, on a site alongside the canal wharves; it was replaced by the present station when the line was doubled in 1908. Governance Wilmcote is part of the Aston Cantlow ward of Stratford on Avon District Council, and is represented by Councillor Sir William Lawrence Baronet, Conservative.Stratford website Nationally it is part of Stratford on Avon constituency, whose member of parliament following the 2010 election is Nadhim Zahawi of the Conservative Party. It is included in the West Midlands electoral region of the European Parliament. Geography Religious sites There was a chapel at Wilmcote, first mentioned in 1228 when the advowson was in dispute between William de Wilmcote, and the Archdeacon of Gloucester. In the 14th century the advowson was held with the manor of Little Wilmcote, until in 1481 Henry de Lisle gave it to the Gild of the Holy Cross at Stratford. The chaplains were instituted and inducted by the vicars of Stratford. The Oxford Movement was a Catholic revival movement in the Church of England in the early nineteenth century, centred in Oxford and Wilmcote was the site they chose to build a church, a school and a retreat house. The early nineteenth-century village had no church, it was then a part of the adjoining parish of Aston Cantlow but with a growing working class population due to the growth of the Wilmcote quarries the village was much in need of a church and a school. The modern church of St. Andrew, built in 1841, is a monument to the influence of the Oxford Movement in the parish. It was built by the Rev. Francis Fortescue-Knottesford and his son, who became the first curate, to meet the semi-industrial conditions created by the opening of the cement works in the 1830s.Highways and Byways in Shakspeares Country, Hutton 1914 It is a small Anglo-Catholic church, dark, spiritual, and on Sundays filled with the smell of incense.

Within the genus it belongs to a group known as the Orellani, all of which are highly toxic ‚Äî eating them results in kidney failure, which is often irreversible. The mushroom is generally tan to brown all over. Taxonomy English naturalist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke described Cortinarius rubellus in 1887 from material collected by a Dr Carlyle at Orton Moss near Carlisle in northwestern England. The name was rarely used before 1980, however. Cortinarius orellanoides was described by Henry in 1937 from mushrooms growing under bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) and beech in France, while Robert K√ºhner and Henri Romagnesi described C. speciosissimus (initially C. speciosus, but that name had already been given to another species of webcap) from mushrooms growing in moss among Vaccinium in pine and spruce forests of the French and Swiss Jura. Cortinarius rainierensis, described in 1950 by Alex H. Smith and Daniel Elliot Stuntz from material collected in Mount Rainier National Park in the United States, is a synonym. Klaus H√∏iland reviewed material of C. orellanoides and C. speciosissimus and determined that the mushrooms and spores were identical. The only difference was that C. orellanoides grew in beech and C. speciosissimus preferred conifers, yet he had also found the latter species growing under beech in Norway. He concluded the name should be C. orellanoides, as that was the older name. H√∏iland and others had noted that C. rubellus was likely to be the same species as well. Gasparini queried this, however, because in Cooke's original illustrations of C. rubellus, he noted that the spores were drawn as triangular or fig-shaped and were not consistent with descriptions of C. orellanoides or C. speciosissimus. In 2007, Bruno Gasparini proposed conserving the name C. speciosissimus against the other names as it had been chiefly known by this name between 1953 and 1980, and some doubts existed over which names were legitimate. Both C. rubellus and C. orellanoides lacked a type specimen and there was a possibility that the description of C. rubellus could have also applied to Cortinarius morrisii. There was no consensus on the proposal as of 2009. C. rubellus is one of seven highly toxic species that make up the orellani, a subgenus within genus Cortinarius. Description Cortinarius rubellus has a conical to convex (partly flattening to umbonate with maturity) cap of diameter. In colour, it is a tawny to date brown with paler margins, and is covered in fine, fibrous scales. The gills are ochre- or caramel-coloured, changing to a deeper brown with age as the spores mature. They have an adnate connection to the stipe. The stipe is tall, and thick with a bulbous base. It is the same colour or slightly paler than the cap, and can have yellow fragments of the veil (cortina) attached to its lower half. The flesh is cream or pale yellow, but more tan below the pileipellis and in the stem base. It smells slightly of radishes and has no strong taste. Distribution and habitat C. rubellus has been recorded in high-latitude temperature to subalpine forests throughout the northern hemisphere, including subalpine conifer forest in the Yatsugatake Mountains in Yamanashi Prefecture, central Japan. In North America, it is found in British Columbia and western Washington, particularly Mount Rainier National Park. C. rubellus also occurs in the north of the British Isles, generally in wet areas of conifer or mixed conifer and broadleaf woodlands, though it is uncommon. Toxicity The danger of Cortinarius rubellus was first recognized in 1972 in Finland, where four cases of poisoning had occurred, two of which resulted in permanent kidney failure. In 1979, three people holidaying in the north of Scotland were poisoned, after mistaking it for the chanterelle. Two of the three required kidney transplants. Twenty-two people were poisoned between 1979 and 1993 in Sweden, nine of which required a kidney transplant following end stage kidney failure (ESRF). Among the edible species they mistook the mushroom for were Craterellus tubaeformis and Hygrophorus species as well as chanterelles. Craterellus tubaeformis can be distinguished by its funnel-shaped cap and ridges on the cap's underside rather than gills. In 1996, one person in Austria ate it while looking for magic mushrooms. Nicholas Evans, author of The Horse Whisperer, his wife Charlotte Gordon Cumming, and two other relatives were accidentally poisoned in September 2008 after consuming deadly webcaps that they gathered on holiday. Evans had assumed they were ceps but overlooked that the mushrooms had gills rather than pores. All four victims were informed that they would require kidney transplants in the future. Several years later, Evans received a kidney donated by his daughter, Lauren. The other three eventually received transplants after some searching for donors, despite Charlotte having only eaten three mouthfuls of mushroom; they were instrumental in setting up the charity Give a Kidney.

One day, though, he broke an urn containing the spirit of Zai, an incredibly evil goatish demon who takes the life force of the kingdom's adults and kidnaps all the babies - except for Upa, who is given a magical rattle by a fairy who was trapped in the urn along with Zai. And so, in order to save his kingdom, Upa crawls into action...\\" Gameplay In-game screenshot of Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa Bio Miracle Bokutte Upas main character is a baby called Upa that uses a rattle to attack his enemies. When injured by the rattle, the enemy inflates and floats away. These inflated enemies can then be used as temporary floating platforms to climb to higher places or they can also be used as weapons if pushed in any direction. If used as a platform, Upa must not stay on top for too long or otherwise it will explode. But if used as a weapon, Upa has to pounce or use his rattle on the inflated enemy to cause it to careen. The enemy will then ricochet off objects and potentially cause damage to both the protagonist and other enemies if it comes in contact with them. The game uses a health meter to monitor the player's remaining life which can be replenished by obtaining bottles of milk scattered throughout the levels. A heart icon can also be obtained, increasing the maximum health by one unit for the duration of the current world. Most items, including the milk bottles and hearts, can be collected by striking special blocks which feature Upa's face. Other items include: Apples, which increase the player's score; hourglasses, which temporarily freeze enemies in place; bells, which give Upa temporary invincibility and the ability to run; and scorpion blocks, which kill all enemies on-screen when they are pushed off a platform and hit the ground. Release history =Cartridge version= In 1993, it was released as a cartridge for the Famicom itself. While it is practically identical to the Disk System version of the game, there are a few differences. The most notable difference is the game's sound. The Family Computer Disk System contained an extra audio channel not available in the Family Computer/NES games. To compensate for the missing audio channel, the music in the Family Computer cartridge version had to be remixed. Also, a difficulty option was added to the Famicom. Additionally, the player is given a choice between an \\"Easy\\" mode, where enemy damage is reduced and the player starts with more lives, and a \\"Normal\\" mode, which is the same difficulty as the original FDS version. Finally, among the smallest of alterations to the game is the title screen, which no longer contains a large image of Upa when it is first displayed. =Chinese version= An unlicensed version for the Famicom was released in China under the name Crayon Xiao xin (Ë†üÁ≠ÜÂ∞èÊñ∞ L√†b«ê xi«éo xƒ´n, Crayon Shin-chan's Chinese title), in which the playable character is replaced with Shinnosuke Nohara, the star of the series. =Mobile phone version= In 2006, Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa was released for mobile phones. =Virtual Console= The Family Computer Disk System version was released on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on June 3, 2008, in North America on June 9, 2008, and in Europe on August 29, 2008.

Features of Spy-Fi include the effects of technology on the espionage trade and the technological gadgets used by the characters, even though the technologies and gadgets portrayed are well beyond current scientific reality. Definition and characteristics Spy-Fi can be defined as media that centers around the adventures of a protagonist (or protagonists) working as a secret agent or a spy. Usually, these adventures will revolve around defeating a rival superpower or singular enemy from achieving a nefarious aim. Content may include themes such as world domination, world destruction, futuristic weapons, and gadgets. Settings vary from outright fantasy, such as outer space or under the sea, to real but exotic locations. Spy-Fi does not necessarily present espionage as it is practiced in reality but rather glamorizes spy-craft through its focus on high-tech equipment, agencies, and organizations with nearly limitless resources and incredibly high-stakes adventures. The spy protagonist may discover in his or her investigation that a mad scientist or evil genius and his secret organization are using futuristic technology to further their schemes. Examples of these include the James Bond film series, the use of advanced scientific technologies for global influence or domination in The Baroness spy novels, using space travel technology to destroy the world as in Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die, weather control in Our Man Flint, using a sonic weapon in Dick Barton Strikes Back, a death ray in Dick Barton at Bay, or replacing world leaders with evil twins in In Like Flint.

Family  Joseph O'Doherty's father Michael O'Doherty was a prosperous entrepreneur from Gortyarrigan in the parish of Desertegney at the side of Raghin Beg mountain on the Inishowen peninsula, County Donegal. When he got married, Michael moved from Gortyarrigan to the town of Derry where he owned a hansom cab business and a chain of butcher shops, kept racing horses, traded in cattle, and supplied meat until 1916 for the British Royal Navy fort at Dunree. Joseph's mother Rose O'Doherty (n√©e McLaughlin 1860‚Äì?) inspired him to become a revolutionary. O'Doherty was born at his parents' home at 14 Little Diamond in the Bogside district of Derry on Christmas Eve 1891. His brother, S√©amus, was also a member of the IRB and took part in the events of the Easter Rising. Education He was first educated at St Columb's College grammar school in Derry. He then studied at St Patrick's College, Drumcondra, (Dublin) where he qualified as a primary school teacher in 1912. Bande Mataram newspaper. When he qualified as a teacher, Ireland was in the middle of the renewed expectations of Home Rule and the opposing activities of Sir Edward Carson, the leader of the Irish Unionist Alliance and of the Ulster Unionist Party. The young Joseph became well-soaked in revolutionary literature ‚Äì partly through his interest in education which led him to read the articles and poetry of P√°draic Pearse ‚Äì and he became a subscriber to the Indian revolutionary newspaper Bande Mataram. By 1913/14, he was completely disillusioned with the Irish Parliamentary Party of John Redmond. With his teacher-training completed, O'Doherty taught for six months. He loved teaching and wanted to continue in this field, but was soon reluctantly persuaded by his elder brother S√©amus O'Doherty to join the struggle for Irish freedom. He then joined the firm of Lawlor Ltd., of Ormonde Quay, Dublin, one of whose directors was Cathal Brugha, who subsequently became the first chairman and President of D√°il √âireann and the first Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army (the Old IRA). He later studied at Trinity College Dublin and was enrolled at King's Inns where he qualified as a Barrister-at-Law. Rebellion =Irish Volunteers= Irish Volunteers mobilisation notice. In 1913 O'Doherty joined the Irish Volunteers (√ìglaigh na h√âireann) when the organisation met at the Rotunda in Dublin. He was a member of the Volunteers 'B' Company, 3d Battalion, Dublin. At the start of World War I, over 90% of the Irish Volunteers joined the National Volunteers and thus enlisted in the 10th (Irish) Division and 16th (Irish) Division of the British Army to fight in Europe. This left the Irish Volunteers with a rump estimated at 10‚Äì14,000 members. The Volunteers fought for Irish independence in 1916's Easter Rising, and were joined by the Irish Citizen Army, Cumann na mBan (The Irishwomen's Council) and Fianna √âireann to form the Irish Republican Army a.k.a. the Old IRA. O'Doherty founded branches of the Volunteers from Crossmaglen to Malin Head. He was given command of the Derry Volunteers in the buildup to 1916 Easter Rising and remained a member of the Executive until 1921. =Irish Republican Brotherhood= Shortly after joining the Volunteers, Joseph's elder brother Seamus informed him of the existence of the secret revolutionary party called the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) of which he was a member. When Seamus asked Joseph for his opinion of secret organisations, Joseph replied that he thought secrecy was necessary to safeguard plans. Until then, he had no idea that the IRB existed and that his brother was a member. He was asked to join and was initiated into it by a close friend of the O'Doherty family, Se√°n Mac Diarmada (Se√°n MacDermott) who was the manager of the radical newspaper Irish Freedom. O'Doherty remained a member of the IRB until after the 1916 Easter Rising, and was specially mobilised by the IRB for the Howth Road and Killcoole gun-runnings. =Gun-running= In 1914, O'Doherty took part in the two audacious gun-running events at Howth and Kilcoole. The first landing took place on 26 July 1914 at Howth, when Erskine Childers and his wife Molly Childers smuggled 1,500 single-shot Mauser 71 rifles from Hamburg, Germany for the Irish Volunteers aboard their 51 ft gaff yacht, the Asgard. The guns, dating from the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71 were still functioning. They were later used in the attack on the General Post Office (GPO) in Dublin during the 1916 Easter Rising. O'Doherty unloaded the first consignment of around 900 Mausers and 29,000 bullets off the Asgard along with Bulmer Hobson, Douglas Hyde, Darrell Figgis, Peadar Kearney, Thomas MacDonagh and others. This happened in public view in broad daylight and quickly led to police and military intervention. While accompanying the weapons convoy on the road from Howth to Dublin, O'Doherty broke the butt of his gun in a skirmish with the security forces, but successfully evaded them. As the King's Own Scottish Borderers infantry regiment returned to barracks, they were accosted at Bachelors Walk by civilians who threw stones and exchanged insults with the regulars. The soldiers bayoneted one man and shot into the unarmed crowd, resulting in four dead and 38 wounded civilians in what became known as the Bachelor's Walk massacre. O'Doherty was also involved in the second gun- running the following week, around midnight on 1 August 1914, when the volunteers landed 600 more German-made Mauser 71 single-shot rifles and 20,000 rounds of ammunition off the Chotah at the much more discretely located beach at Kilkoole, Co. Wicklow, and spirited them away under cover of darkness. O'Doherty was in the lorry that delivered that consignment to a cache at St. Enda's School (which Padraic Pearse had founded in 1908) and which was now located at The Hermitage at Rathfarnam in the foothills of the Dublin Mountains where Pearse was waiting for them on the steps. =Other operations= In 1914 O'Doherty was one of a special group of IRB men mobilised under William Conway to frustrate a British Army recruiting meeting that was to be held at the Mansion House in Dublin. They were mobilised in Parnell Square with about 24 hours' rations and with arms, but the word came that a large group of British soldiers were in Dublin Castle and had taken over control of the area so that it would be impossible to get in, and the operation was called off. In 1914, O'Doherty took part in a little-known operation in which the Irish Volunteers seized part of the 216 tonnes of guns and ammunition that had been delivered to the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force from the German Empire, in the Larne gun-running incident on 24 and 25 April of that year. Soon afterwards, while attending a play at a theatre in Dublin with another member of the Volunteer Executive, O'Doherty was arrested in the lobby during the intermission. As they were about to be marched up to Dublin Castle, O'Doherty realised that they would both be tortured to reveal the location of the weapons caches and other information. Taking advantage of the soldiers being distracted by the crowd of onlookers who had gathered outside the theatre, O'Doherty ducked under the soldiers‚Äô bayonets, leapt onto a passing tram, and escaped into the night. Days later, his friend's body was found, dismembered, at the Featherbed in the nearby Dublin mountains. O'Doherty remained in Dublin until 1915 when his father asked him to return to Derry to manage the chain of butchers' shops business which he had recently bought there. After moving back to Derry, he joined the Derry branch of the Volunteers with Patrick McCartan who had previously edited the journal Irish Freedom in Pennsylvania, USA, and who was now in control of the IRB in the North. At McCartan's request in January 1916, O'Doherty took a delivery of arms via a trader named Edmiston & Scotts. The Derry Volunteer group also obtained quantities of .303 rifle ammunition which were delivered to Dublin, frequently by O'Doherty and members of his family. =1916 Easter Rising= O'Doherty was charged by the Irish Volunteers Executive to co- ordinate the Easter Rising in Derry, and to wait for the signal to begin the planned operation. But to his great dismay on Easter Sunday morning, the Sunday Independent newspaper published a last-minute countermanding order by the Volunteers Chief of Staff, Eoin MacNeill advising the Volunteers not to take part. Although the rising did take place in Dublin, the Derry Volunteers did not participate due to confusion over this countermanding order and a subsequent breakdown in communications with Dublin. The rising took place mainly in Dublin where it caused considerable damage. Although volunteer groups also took action in Kerry, Cork, Wexford, Kildare, Donegal, and Galway, a considerable section of the Volunteers did not participate ‚Äì partly as a result of MacNeill's cancellation. A total of 3,430 men and 79 women were arrested. 187 were tried under a series of court-martials, and 90 were sentenced to death. 14 of them including all seven signatories of the Proclamation and were executed by firing squad at Kilmainham Gaol between 3 and 12 May. The most prominent leader to escape execution was the Commandant of the 3rd Battalion, √âamon de Valera, partly because of his American birth. He subsequently became President of the Irish Republic. =Capture and prison= Irish revolutionary prisoners at the Frongoch internment camp in Wales, after the Easter Rising in 1916. O'Doherty is second from right in the top row. O'Doherty and his brother Seamus were arrested a few days after the Easter Rising and taken in handcuffs to Dublin where they were imprisoned in Richmond Barracks in Dublin. O'Doherty was sent soon afterwards to the Abercorn Barracks at Ballykinlar in County Down. He spent time at Belfast gaol, Derry gaol, and was subsequently moved to Wakefield Prison in West Yorkshire (England), Wormwood Scrubs in London and the Frongoch internment camp in Wales, where he was sent as an Irish prisoner of war along with 1,800 others including Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith. Although he was not imprisoned in Mountjoy Gaol, he was one of the last people to speak to P√°draig Pearse (1879‚Äì1916) there (either as a visitor or through a window) before the latter was executed by firing squad. In a filmed interview decades later, O'Doherty said \\"Those of us who were arrested were transferred in handcuffs to Richmond Barracks in Dublin, and subsequently transferred to England. Our crowd were marched between the files of a British regiment through the streets of Dublin, and several sections were stoned.\\" [Quoted from a statement by him used (but not with his own voice) in the TG4 documentary film, \\"Internment Camp Frongoch\\" : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgG-L8thLvM Although the failure of the Rising was a major disappointment for the Volunteers, the Frongoch internment camp became known as the \\"University of Revolution\\", where the inmates planned their successful strategy to establish the First Dail in 1919. Among those interned there, 30 would become TDs (including O'Doherty, Richard Mulcahy, Michael Collins, Se√°n T. O'Kelly) and √âamon de Valera, two of whom later became Presidents of Ireland. After a few weeks, however, their prisoner of war status and privileges were withdrawn, and O'Doherty was released in early August 1916 O'Doherty went back to Derry and helped his father re-open the head office of his family business, and then in December he was contacted and asked to come up and manage the first republican paper that was published in 1916, called \\"The Phoenix\\". =German Plot= On the night of 16‚Äì17 May 1918, O'Doherty was arrested along with 150 Sinn F√©in leaders concerning the so-called German Plot. This was disinformation campaign of black propaganda organised by the Dublin Castle administration to discredit Sinn F√©in by falsely accusing it of conspiring with the German Empire to start an armed insurrection and invade in Ireland during World War I. This alleged conspiracy which would have diverted the British war effort, was used to justify the internment of Sinn F√©in leaders, who were actively opposing attempts to introduce conscription in Ireland. O'Doherty was put in Arbour Hill gaol , but was released in 1917. He became a member of the executive of the Irish Volunteers that year.  Marriage  Margaret (Mair√©ad) Claire Susan O'Doherty (n√©e Irvine) 1893‚Äì1986. In 1918, O'Doherty married Margaret (Mair√©ad) Claire Susan Irvine (1893‚Äì1986), the same year she graduated as a medical doctor. She was born in Maguiresbridge, County Fermanagh. She studied medicine [where?] and after marrying O'Doherty, was appointed Chief Medical Officer of Derry, a post she occupied from 1919 to 1921, during the last year working without pay because she refused to take the Oath of Allegiance Oath of Allegiance (Ireland) to the English King George V.  Governance  =1918 general election= In the aftermath of the Easter Rising of 1916, the Sinn F√©in party (founded by Arthur Griffith in 1905), was reorganised and grew into a nation-wide movement, calling for abstention from Westminster and the establishment of a separate and independent Irish parliament. The party contested the 14 December 1918 general election, called following the dissolution of the British Parliament, and swept the country winning 73 of the 105 Irish seats. O'Doherty, now aged 24, was elected as Sinn F√©in Member of the UK Parliament for Donegal North, defeating his only opponent (from the Irish Parliamentary Party. Acting on their pledge not to sit in the Westminster parliament, but instead to set up an Irish legislative assembly, 28 of the newly elected Sinn F√©in representatives met and constituted themselves as the first D√°il √âireann. The remaining Sinn F√©in representatives were either in prison or unable to attend for other reasons. The establishment of the First D√°il occurred on the same day as the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence (1919‚Äì1921) between the Irish Republican Army (the army of the Irish Republic known as the Old IRA) and the British security forces in Ireland. It was an escalation of the Irish revolutionary period into warfare. =First D√°il= The first D√°il met in the Round Room of the Mansion House in the heart of Dublin on 21 January 1919. The D√°il asserted the exclusive right of the elected representatives of the Irish people to legislate for the country. The Members present adopted a Provisional Constitution and approved the Declaration of Independence. The D√°il also approved a Democratic Programme, based on the 1916 Proclamation of the Irish Republic, and read and adopted a Message to the Free Nations of the World. Following the simultaneous outbreak of the War of Independence in January 1919, the British Government decided to suppress the D√°il, and on 10 September 1919 D√°il √âireann was declared a dangerous association and was prohibited. Defying the law, however, the D√°il continued to meet in secret, and Ministers carried out their duties as best they could. In all, the D√°il held fourteen sittings in 1919. Of these, four were public and ten private. Three private sittings were held in 1920 and four in 1921. Members of the First D√°il taken on 9 April 1919 on the steps of the Mansion House in Dublin. Joseph O'Doherty is 4th from the left in the second row. O'Doherty was re-elected at the 1921 general election and opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty which led to the partition of Ireland. In a D√°il meeting, he made the following statement: \\"I know that the people in North Donegal at the present moment would accept this Treaty, and I think it is fair to the people of North Donegal that I should make that known; but they are accepting it under duress and at the point of the bayonet, and as a stop to terrible and immediate war. Like my co-Deputy from T√≠r Chonaill I came to this Session of D√°il √âireann with a mind that was open to conviction against these prejudices that I had; no argument that has been produced by those who are for this Treaty has made any influence on me; I see in it the giving away of the whole case of Irish independence; I am prepared to admit that the mandate I got from the constituents of North Donegal was one of self-determination; and it is a terrible thing and a terrible trial to have men in this D√°il interpreting that sacred principle here against the interests of the people. It is not peace they are getting; it is not the liberty they are getting which they are told they are getting, and they know it; and I will tell them honestly if I go to North Donegal again what they are getting.\\" He was subsequently re-elected as Anti-Treaty Sinn F√©in and as an abstentionist republican in 1922 and 1923 respectively. =Civil War= British Army intelligence file for Joseph O'Doherty Following the signing of the Anglo- Irish Treaty, the Irish Civil War broke out between the pro-treaty Provisional Government led by Michael Collins (which became the Free State in December 1922) and the anti-treaty opposition (which was supported by O'Doherty) and which rejected the treaty as a betrayal of the Irish Republic (which had been proclaimed during the Easter Rising). This war lasted from 28 June 1922 ‚Äì 24 May 1923. Many of those who fought on both sides in the conflict had been members of the Irish Republican Army (Old IRA) during the War of Independence, including family members who fought each other, with atrocities and revenge killings on both sides. This caused great grief all around and led O'Doherty to become quite depressed at times. The war came to an end a year and a month after it began, when the Free State forces, who benefited from substantial quantities of weapons provided by the British Government, defeated those who opposed the Treaty and the partition of Ireland. =Adventures in the US= Joseph O'Doherty at the Irish Republican office in New York, between 1922‚Äì1926. In 1922‚Äì24 and 1925‚Äì26, √âamon de Valera sent him on two Republican missions to the US with Se√°n T. O'Kelly and Frank Aiken to lobby and raise funds for the civil war. He crossed the Atlantic aboard a luxury liner, where during a dinner party hosted by the ship's captain, another guest who was a world-famous boxer challenged him to a fight to entertain the passengers, but O'Doherty had to decline in order to avoid drawing attention to himself. Travelling under a false passport as a Presbyterian minister to Canada, he entered the US by crossing the border with help from Irish whiskey smugglers (this was during the Prohibition era when alcohol was illegal in the USA). He visited every capitol in all 50 contiguous US states, dropped thousands of fundraising leaflets from a biplane flying between Manhattan skyscrapers in New York, and lived there with his wife Margaret Clare O'Doherty in her flat at Columbus Circle, while she practised medicine at St. Vincent's hospital in Greenwich Village. He had an office at 8 East 41st. Street in Manhattan, New York. On 17 October 1924 the British Consulate General in New York issued him with a new British Passport under his own name. His related adventures included descending the Grand Canyon on horseback, being invited to join a police raid on an opium den in San Francisco's Chinatown. =Co-founding Fianna F√°il= In 1926 O'Doherty he left the Sinn F√©in party's Ard Fheis (annual party conference) with √âamon de Valera and became a founder member of the new Fianna F√°il party. He lost his seat at the June 1927 general election but was re-elected again to the D√°il in the 1933 general election. He was elected to the Senate of Ireland (Seanad √âireann) in 1928, serving as one of Fianna F√°il's first six elected Senators under the leadership of Joseph Connolly. From 1929 to 1933 served as the County Manager of Carlow and Kildare, where he used his knowledge of dowsing to find water supplies for local towns. In 1936 O'Doherty successfully sued Ernie O'Malley for libel. The incident in question involved a raid Michael Collins had proposed to take place on 1 October 1919 at Moville, County Donegal. O'Malley, in his book On Another Man's Wound, had implied that O'Doherty had refused to go. In fact, it had been agreed, without O'Doherty's intervention, that it would be inappropriate for a member of the D√°il to be involved.Richard English, Ernie O'Malley: IRA Intellectual, p. 44, Oxford University Press, 1999, Family O'Doherty and his wife had five children: Dr. Brid O'Doherty (1919‚Äì2018), a member of the Saint Louis order of nuns; Dr. F√≠ona O'Callaghan (1921‚Äì2003); Dr. Rois√≠n McCallum (1924‚Äì2018); Sr. Deirdre O'Doherty (a nun with the Poor Clare order (1927‚Äì2007) in Newry; and David O'Docherty (1935‚Äì2010) a painter and traditional Irish musician.Nun who became an expert in French Romanticism ‚Äì Brid O'Doherty' Obituaries, Irish Times, Weekend Edition, 4 August 2018.

(CPSA, Caborroje√±os for Health and Environment) is a non-profit environmentalist organization based in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. The organization was founded in 1990 by a group of concerned residents who wanted to improve the livings standards of Cabo Rojo and Puerto Rico in general, and was incorporated as a non-profit in 1991. The organization's first president and main driving force was Efr√©n P√©rez Rivera, an ecologist and retired professor of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez. The organization partnered with the US Fish & Wildlife Service to preserve and manage the Cabo Rojo Salt Flats. CPSA promotes efforts to preserve the indigenous flora and fauna of the Cabo Rojo area. The organization created and manages the Centro Interpretativo, a visitors' center in the Salinas area, near the Los Morrillos Lighthouse. Volunteers at the Centro Interpretativo provide guided walking tours that allow visitors to experience the local wildlife and fauna. CPSA collaborated with Walmart on the Sowing the Development of the Country (SDE) Project before withdrawing in 2008. The group was also actively involved in the preservation of Isla de Ratones (Mice Island), a small island off the coast of Cabo Rojo. The island has been suffering from significant erosion during the past decades. Caborroje√±os Pro Salud y Ambiente, with the help of the local government, planted mangroves and launched a project to repopulate the local coral population in order to stop the erosion. The group was part of the alliance of environmental groups that fought the installation the carbon power station Cogentrix. Caborroje√±os Pro Salud y Ambiente was actively involved in the reconstruction effort of the Los Morrillos Lighthouse, achieving a grant from the U.S. Federal government to restore the historic building. However, political moves and the inactivity of Cabo Rojo mayor Santos Padilla doomed the plan and the federal grant was lost. In 1999, the group received the Urban Community Award, presented by the Puerto Rico Forestry Conference Annual Convention. In 2003, the organization was awarded the Environmental Protection Agency Environmental Quality Award The group was also recognized by the Miranda Foundation. The current president is retired college professor Dr. Pedro Valle Carlo.

Classification * In the first, and by far most common type, nonhereditary myositis ossificans (commonly referred to simply as \\"myositis ossificans\\", as in the remainder of this article), calcifications occur at the site of injured muscle, most commonly in the arms or in the quadriceps of the thighs. ** The term myositis ossificans traumatica is sometimes used when the condition is due to trauma. Also myositis ossificans circumscripta is another synonym of myositis ossificans traumatica refers to the new extraosseous bone that appears after trauma. * The second condition, myositis ossificans progressiva (also referred to as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva) is an inherited affliction, autosomal dominant pattern, in which the ossification can occur without injury, and typically grows in a predictable pattern. Although this disorder can be passed to offspring by those afflicted with FOP, it is also classified as nonhereditary, as it is most often attributed to a spontaneous genetic mutation upon conception. Most (i.e. 80%) ossifications arise in the thigh or arm, and are caused by a premature return to activity after an injury. Other sites include intercostal spaces, erector spinae, pectoralis muscles, glutei, and the chest. On planar x-ray, hazy densities are sometimes noted approximately one month after injury, while the denser opacities eventually seen may not be apparent until two months have passed. Pathophysiology The exact mechanism of myositis ossificans is not clear. Inappropriate response of stem cells in the bone against the injury or inflammation causes inappropriate differentiation of fibroblasts into osteogenic cells. When a skeletal muscle is injured, inflammatory cytokines (Bone morphogenetic protein 2, Bone morphogenetic protein 4, and Transforming growth factor) are released. These cytokines stimulate the endothelial cells of the blood vessels to transform into mesenchymal stem cells. These mesenchymal stem cells then differentiate into chondrocytes, and osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation in soft tissues. The process of myositis ossificans can be divided into three stages: early, intermediate, and mature. The early phase occurs in the first four weeks of injury with inflammatory phase of bone formation. This is followed by intermediate phase of bone formation (four to eight weeks following injury) where calcification started to occur and is visible on X-rays. During the maturation phase, mature bone started to form. As the maturation continues, the bone will consolidate in the coming months and subsequently bone regression occurs. Diagnosis =Sonographic diagnosis= Calcification is typically depicted 2 weeks earlier by ultrasound (US) when compared to radiographs. The lesion develops in two distinct stages with different presentations at US. In the early stage, termed immature, it depicts a non- specific soft tissue mass that ranges from a hypoechoic area with an outer sheet-like hyperechoic peripheral rim to a highly echogenic area with variable shadowing. In the late stage, termed mature, myositis ossificans is depicted as an elongated calcific deposit that is aligned with the long-axis of the muscle, exhibits acoustic shadowing, and has no soft tissue mass associated. US may suggest the diagnosis at early stage, but imaging features need to evolve with successive maturation of the lesion and formation of the characteristic late stage changes before they become pathognomonic. The differential diagnosis includes many tumoral and nontumoral pathologies. A main concern is to differentiate early myositis ossificans from malignant soft-tissue tumors, and the latter is suggested by a fast-growing process. If clinical or sonographic findings are dubious and extraosseous sarcoma is suspected, biopsy should be performed. At histology, detection of the typical zonal phenomenon is diagnostic of myositis ossificans, though microscopic findings may be misleading during the early stage. =Radiologic diagnosis= The radiological features of myositis ossificans are ‚Äòfaint soft tissue calcification within 2‚Äì6 weeks, (may have well-defined bony margins by 8 weeks) separated from periosteum by lucent zone and on CT, the characteristic feature is peripheral ossification‚Äô.  Management  Since myositis ossificians is more common in those with bleeding disorders, the formation of bone in soft tissue is thought to be associated with haematoma formation. As the calcifications will typically resolve after a period of time, non-surgical treatment is encouraged to minimize the unpleasant symptoms and maximize the function of the affected limb. Following a skeletal muscle injury, the affected limb should be immobilized with bed rest, ice therapy, compression, and elevation of the affected limb. Crutches can be used for ambulation while providing adequate rest for the affected limb and minimizing the haematoma formation. Ice therapy for 15 to 20 minutes every 30 to 60 minutes is useful to reduce the skeletal muscle blood flow by 50%. Aggressive limb physiotherapy is not recommended at this stage to prevent the worsening of symptoms. After 48 to 72 hours, range of motion exercise can be introduced as long as the range of motion is not painful. If the lesion becomes more mature, active range of motion and resistance strengthening exercises are useful in maintaining joint function. Surgical excision is reserved for those who failed the non-surgical treatment, those with intolerable pain, compression of the neurovascular structures, or limitation of the range of motion of the joint which affects the activities of daily living. Surgery is only performed after 6 to 18 months following injury because surgery does not alter the bone maturation process. If a surgery is performed too early, it may predispose to recurrence. However, the optimum timing for surgery and the rate of recurrence following early surgery is controversial because some studies have shown that early surgery does reduce the rate of recurrence. For those who had total hip replacement or total hip arthroplasty, postoperative single low-dose radiation with 3 weeks of oral indomethacin regimen will be preventive for heterotopic ossification. Radiation therapy is also effective in preventing recurrence in those who had done operative excision of heterotopic ossification of the elbow.

The charity was renamed Sue Ryder Care in 1996, before adopting its current name in 2011. Care centres Sue Ryder's neurological care centre The Chantry in Chantry Park, Ipswich. The South Oxfordshire Palliative Care Hub at Joyce Grove in Nettlebed. Sue Ryder supports people living with life-limiting and long-term conditions including brain injury, cancer, dementia, strokes, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and motor neuron disease. It operates specialist palliative care centres, care centres for people with complex conditions, homecare services and a growing number of community-based services. The charity also offers support to people who are bereaving the death of a loved one, through face-to-face services in its centres and also as an online service, as part of a bespoke online community. Sue Ryder care centres are currently operated in the following areas: *Aberdeen, Scotland: Dee View Court (neurological care centre) *Cheltenham, Gloucestershire: Leckhampton Court Hospice (palliative care centre) *Cuerden, Lancashire: Cuerden Hall (neurological care centre) *Ipswich, Suffolk: The Chantry (neurological care centre) *Leeds, West Yorkshire: Wheatfields Hospice (palliative care centre) *Moggerhanger, Bedfordshire: St John's Hospice (palliative care centre) *Nettlebed, Oxfordshire: South Oxfordshire Palliative Care Hub (palliative care centre) *Oxenhope, West Yorkshire: Manorlands Hospice (palliative care centre) *Peterborough, Cambridgeshire: Thorpe Hall Hospice (palliative care centre) *Reading, Berkshire: Duchess of Kent Hospice (palliative care centre) *St Paul's Walden, Hertfordshire: Stagenhoe (neurological care centre) The charity also provides home-based neurological care in the Scottish areas of Angus and Stirling. Fundraising Sue Ryder has over 450 charity shops in the UK, which provide more than ¬£3 million income annually. Sue Ryder's income was ¬£49.6 million during the year ending 31 March 2018, which included ¬£26.9 million from NHS and local authority funding, and ¬£20.7 million from fundraising campaigns and retail sales (both online and in the charity's 449 shops). The income was used for providing 2.5 million hours of care to over 97,000 people in the UK. In addition to full- time staff, the charity currently has more than 11,000 volunteers supporting its work across the UK, which in 2017/18 accounted for an estimated ¬£30.2 million worth of work. Volunteering roles cover many areas of the charity's work, including administration, catering, transport, gardening, fundraising, finance, retail, photography, events coordination, cleaning, research, befriending and bereavement support. Sue Ryder launched its Prisoner Volunteer Programme in 2006. It works with around 40 prisons nationwide offering work experience in 100 locations, including offices, shops and warehouses. The programme has won a number of awards, including the Education and Training award at Civil Society's Charity Awards in 2013. In 2014, the charity opened a shop in Slough which offered staff roles to homeless people in partnership with the organisation Slough Homeless Our Concern. Controversy In February 2013, Sue Ryder was criticised alongside other charitable organisations for taking part in the UK Government's workfare scheme, in which people living on benefits were instructed to attend unpaid work at various companies and charities, at the risk of otherwise losing their benefits. After enlisting \\"around 1,000\\" volunteers as part of the scheme, Sue Ryder later promised a \\"phased withdrawal\\" due to online protests. The charity later released a statement explaining that they had chosen to withdraw in order to \\"protect staff from an online campaign of harassment\\".

Thunderbird was primarily intended to attack higher altitude targets at ranges up to approximately , providing wide-area air defence for the Army in the field. AA guns were still used for lower altitude threats. Thunderbird entered service in 1959 and underwent a major mid-life upgrade to Thunderbird 2 in 1966, before being slowly phased out by 1977. Ex- Army Thunderbirds were also operated by the Royal Saudi Air Force after 1967. Thunderbird had performance similar to other semi-portable missiles like the US MIM-23 Hawk and fully mobile Soviet 2K11 Krug, although it pre-dates both of these systems. After its mid-life upgrades, which shared several components with the RAF's Bristol Bloodhound, Thunderbird featured a continuous-wave radar semi-active homing system that was highly resistant to radar jamming and deception, and was able to track targets even at very low altitudes. Thunderbird was the Army's only heavy anti-aircraft missile. As missile systems like Thunderbird made flight at medium and higher altitudes practically suicidal, nap-of-the-earth flying became the norm and even shorter-range, faster acting systems were needed. Thunderbird's role was taken over by the much smaller BAC Rapier as it became available. History A Thunderbird I missile minus finned-boosters, a museum exhibit at the Midland Air Museum, England. Thunderbird missile (front) =Red Heathen and Sea Slug= Thunderbird traces its history to the 1947 reorganization of British missile projects. At the time there was a wide variety of concepts under study among various groups in the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. All of these were handed to the Ministry of Supply (MoS) with the Royal Aircraft Establishment (REA) providing technical direction. In 1944, a panel known as the GAP Committee formed within the MoS to consider the possibility of surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). The group was reformed several times, growing each time as the topic grew more important. They eventually developed a requirement for a medium-range SAM with a maximum range of based on concepts being developed under the LOPGAP experimental program. This became the Red Heathen project in 1947, and English Electric won the development contract. The MoS was also working on a second SAM project, the somewhat shorter-ranged Sea Slug with performance on the order of . This was initially worked on using LOPGAP technology using a liquid-fueled rocket by a team led by Armstrong Whitworth. The RAE was interested in seeing ramjet technology applied to this role, and asked de Haviland to submit an entry for Sea Slug as well. They were too busy working with Red Hawk, so the contract was offered to Bristol Aerospace instead. Due to the way radar signals spread out in space with increasing range, beam riding is only useful at shorter ranges. A paper produced by the RAE suggested that there was no way Red Heathen's accuracy requirements could be met by a beam riding system at the desired range with existing radars. This meant new Gun Laying radars would have to be developed for this role, and that, in turn, led to a re-evaluation of the Red Heathen concept. Red Heathen re-emerged in 1949 with the same required range as Sea Slug, and Bristol's ramjet-powered Sea Slug design was redirected to this new requirement. In 1952 the projects were once again split, with Bristol's effort becoming Red Duster while English Electric's became Red Shoes. =The Stage Plan= The Thunderbird was intended to provide ground-based air defence to the British Army in the field. As such, it was intended to replace the 3.7-inch heavy anti-aircraft gun that fulfilled this role during World War II. Like the 3.7, the new missile would be operated by the Royal Artillery. English Electric created a Guided Weapons Division to work on the project. While the project was starting, the Ministry of Supply (MoS) began work on what would become known as the \\"Stage Plan\\", which envisioned a multi-stage program to provide an integrated air-defence network including new radars, interceptor aircraft, and missiles. As the missiles were the least understood technology, the MoS decided to implement their deployment in two stages. \\"Stage 1\\" called for missiles with a range of only 20 miles with capabilities against subsonic or low-supersonic attacking aircraft, which were assumed to be at medium or high altitudes. The Stage 1 missile would be used to protect the V bomber bases in the UK, as well as the British Army in the field.\\"The Stage Plan\\" skomer.u-net.com The Stage 1 missile would be later replaced with a much higher-performance and longer-range \\"Stage 2\\" system in the 1960s, based on the Green Sparkler missile. The Stage 2 missile was to have greatly increased range, speed, and altitude capabilities. After a minor change in its specifications, it became the Blue Envoy project. Two entries were accepted for the original Stage 1 proposal, English Electric's existing project under the name \\"Red Shoes\\",\\"Red Shoes\\" skomer.u-net.com and Bristol's \\"Red Duster\\".\\"Bloodhound\\" skomer.u-net.com The two systems were very similar in design and performance, with the Bristol model differing primarily by offering somewhat longer range at the cost of being less mobile. Given the similarities, a single set of radars was developed that could be used with either design. This consisted of a Ferranti developed search radar and the target illuminating radar was the RRDE's \\"Yellow River\\" fire control radar built by British Thomson-Houston.Cold War, Hot Science: Applied Research in Britain's Defence Laboratories, 1945-1990 Bud, Gummett NMSI Trading Ltd, (2002) p228 =Development= Colourful display of Thunderbird II airframe in Anti-Aircraft Museum, Tuusula, Finland. Note the changes to the main fins. Missile rear end connector details. The Artillery Museum of Finland, H√§meenlinna. Thunderbird at RAF Museum Cosford EE's design quickly developed into a fairly simple cylindrical fuselage with an ogive nose cone, four cropped-delta wings just behind the middle point of the fuselage, and four smaller control surfaces at the rear, in-line with the mid-mounted wings. The fuselage had a slight boat-tail narrowing at the extreme rear under the control surfaces. The sustainer was to be a liquid fuel rocket developed for the missile, and was launched by four large \\"Gosling\\" solid fuel rocket boosters lying between the control surfaces and wings. The boosters featured a single oversized fin of their own, and are particularly easy to spot due to a small flat surface at the end of every fin. This surface provided an outward drag component that help pull the booster away from the main body when released, helped by the booster's asymmetrical nose cone. Guidance was via semi-active radar homing, the Ferranti Type 83 \\"Yellow River\\" pulsed radar serving both as an acquisition and illumination system. The same radar was used with the competing Red Duster. The test programme used development vehicles D1 to D4. D1 and D2 established some of the basic configuration issues, whilst D3 and D4 were used to test the aerodynamics of the design. The Army rejected the idea of using a liquid fuel rocket because of the difficulty in handling the highly reactive fuel in the field, so a solid rocket sustainer had to be chosen instead. Several different models of sustainer were tried, most of them known as the \\"Luton Test Vehicle\\", or LTV. While testing of the Red Shoes was underway, the \\"competition\\" in the form of Red Duster was also entering testing. Red Duster demonstrated several serious problems, and the Army ended any interest in it. In the end the Red Duster problems were sorted out fairly quickly, and it entered service slightly before Red Shoes, as the Bristol Bloodhound Mk. I. The production Red Shoes missile was officially named Thunderbird. It entered service in 1959 and equipped 36 and 37 Heavy Air Defence Regiments, Royal Artillery. It was the first British-designed and produced missile to go into service with the British Army. =Further development= While development of the Stage 1 missiles was still ongoing, work on the Stage 2 systems was proving to be too far in advance of the state of the art to realistically enter service while the Red Duster and Red Shoes were still useful. In the meantime, advances in radar technology were proceeding rapidly, so it was decided to produce interim designs using new continuous wave radars which would dramatically improve the performance of the existing missiles. In the case of the Thunderbird, the \\"Stage 1¬Ω\\" design utilized the new Type 86 \\"Indigo Corkscrew\\" radar. As this was developed it changed names several times, becoming \\"Green Flax\\", and after some paperwork with that name on it was lost and assumed compromised, \\"Yellow Temple\\". In service it was known as Radar, AD, No 10 (fire control). The new radar greatly improved performance against low-level targets, as well as providing considerably better performance against electronic countermeasures. To support Thunderbird operations in the field the regiments were equipped with the new Radar, AD, No 11 (tactical control, usually called 'Big Ears') and Radar, AD, No 12 (height finder, usually called 'Noddy') radar, giving them a longer range surveillance system. These radars were also known to Marconi as the S303 and S404, or to the RAF as Type 88 and Type 89. After leaving Army service in 1977 they were turned over to the RAF who used them for tactical control. Several changes to the basic missile were undertaken as well. Although the size remained the same, the new version featured much larger boosters, mid- mounted wings with sweep on the front and back, and a new nose cone with a much higher fineness ratio. The boosters lost their asymmetrical nose cones, but the surfaces on the end of their fins grew much larger. Overall the missile still looked much like the Mk. I version, as opposed to the Bloodhound which became much larger as it was upgraded. The improved missile was known in service as Thunderbird 2. They entered service in 1966 and were removed in 1977.Thunderbird Surface to Air Missile System Operators = Former = ; : British Army ; : Finnish Army - planned purchase of either Thunderbird or Bloodhound was eventually cancelled, but only after deactivated training missiles had been delivered in the late 1960s.

Anatol Marco Josepho (born Anatol—É Markovich Yozefovich, , later germanized as Anatol Josephewitz; March 31, 1894 - December 16, 1980), was a Jewish immigrant to the United States from Tomsk, Russia, who invented and patented the first automated photo booth in 1925, which was named the \\"Photomaton\\". In 1927, he was paid one million dollars for the invention.  Biography  Josepho's father was a wealthy jeweler and his mother died when he was three years old. He developed a close bond with his father and became interested in the Wild West cultural phenomenon of expansion in the United States in the late 1800s. He began taking photographs with a Brownie camera produced by the Eastman Kodak Company during his childhood and he attended a local technical institute to pursue his growing interest in photography in 1909 at the age of 15. On the eve of world war I, his father sent him to study in Germany. There, he studied the photo art to perfection. It was there that he conceived the idea of creating a photo machine that would work without an operator inside and would be able to produce photos automatically, but from the moment of conception to implementation it took more than 12 years. With the beginning of the First world war, the he moved to Shanghai. There he survived the revolution of 1917 and for a time worked as a photographer in his own photo studio. In the early 1920s, he briefly returned to Tomsk, where he soon left to the United States. In the early 1920s, he worked in New York to develop the Photomaton. In July 1926, he met and married Ganna Belle Kehlmann (January 10, 1904 ‚Äì October 19, 1978). The two were friends with their neighbor, performer Will Rogers and his wife Betty Blake. They had two children, both boys. He died on December 16, 1980, at the age of 86 in a rest home in La Jolla from a series of strokes.  The Photomaton  Josepho's invention of the photo booth, known as the \\"Photomaton\\", debuted in September 1925 at 1659 Broadway Street in Manhattan, located in the heart of New York City. The Photomaton charged twenty-five cents for a strip of eight photos that were developed in eight minutes. The automation was achieved in a room that synchronized a coin controlled camera that featured a single source of diffuse light. White-gloved attendants stayed by the machine during hours of operation to control the crowds as well as to provide maintenance for the machine. Around 280,000 customers, for instance, waited the eight-minute process as reported by Time magazine in April 1927. The Photomaton Company was created to place Photomaton machines all over the country. Future President Franklin D. Roosevelt was a member of the board of directors. In 1928, Josepho sold the rights to the machine to Henry Morgenthau, Sr. for $1,000,000, . In an interview with The New York Times, Morgenthau said that the machine will allow them \\"to do in the photographic field what Woolworths has done in novelties and merchandise, Ford in automobiles\\". The following year, the machine was introduced to the European market with notable figures such as Andr√© Breton and Salvador Dal√≠ had their portraits taken. Legacy Camp Josepho, a 110-acre property, which stretches from Mandeville Canyon to Will Rogers State Park, was given to the Boy Scouts of the Crescent Bay Council on July 7, 1941, by Anatol Josepho Sixty-five years later, Camp Josepho under the Western Los Angeles County Council (WLACC) continues to fulfill its mission of serving youth throughout Los Angeles, with a unique emphasis on filmmaking, shooting sports, and computer programming. Remnants of what once was Josepho's personal mansion can be found between the camp and Murphy Ranch.

Menaker's family were noted radicals and one of Menaker's nieces, Ellen, was married to Victor Perlo, head of the Perlo group. He is named for utopian socialist Robert Owen. Menaker was identified by Arlington Hall cryptographers in sixteen Venona messages. Menaker assisted Floyd Miller's infiltration of the Socialist Workers Party. Several Venona messages are related to Menaker's employer, Michael Burd, for whom Menaker worked at the Midland Export Corporation of New York City. In 1944 and 1945, Menaker traveled to Chile to represent Midland Export. While in Chile he met the Chilean diplomat Christian Casanova Subercaseaux. Burd and Subercaseaux were also both Soviet intelligence agents. After returning from his 1944 Chile trip, Burd complained to the New York KGB office that Menaker alienated several companies they did business with. KGB Officer Pavel Ivanovich Fedosimov reported to Moscow that \\"allowances should be made working with Menaker since he had not been thoroughly trained or screened prior to assignment. In a later Venona transcript, the KGB speculates about the possibility that Laurence Duggan, another source who had recently resigned from the U.S. State Department, might go to Chile in place of Menaker or do some unspecified work with him. A cable from October references work with Joseph Katz, owner of the Tempus Import Company in Manhattan, and one of the KGB's most active agents.

They employ the use of symphonic and power metal influences that feature synthesizers. As of 2016, they have released four albums: The 1st Chapter in 2005, Isolate in 2007, Nine in 2012 and Havoc in 2016.  History  = Formation and early history (2000‚Äì2003) = In 2000 long-time bandmates Michael Eriksen (vocals) and brothers Mats (guitar) and Truls Haugen (drums) were joined by keyboard player Espen Stor√∏ and Glen Cato M√∏llen on bass to form Circus Maximus. Initially being a cover band, they got a lot of positive feedback for their interpretations of technically challenging material from bands like Dream Theater and Symphony X. Before long, the band started to write their own material: With other influences varying from pop/rock through classical progressive rock to heavy metal and death metal, their music synergized into a mixture of melodic and groovy sound with many heavy riffs and odd time signatures. In the musical press their sound has been compared to Queensr√øche, TNT, Shadow Gallery, Pretty Maids, Helloween and the like, in addition to the aforementioned bands. Releasing two demos to great reviews in Norway, as well as in Europe and United States, before signing with Danish Intromental Management in April 2004, the band made a record deal with American Sensory Records for the US and Canada, which in turn forwarded a licensing deal for Europe and Russia to Frontiers Records. = The 1st Chapter (2004‚Äì2006) = Circus Maximus began writing their debut album in 2004 entitled, The 1st Chapter which was released in May 2005. The eight-tracked album contains the longest Circus Maximus song with the title track running for over 19 minutes. The album also came with two bonus tracks. Half a year later, in November 2005, keyboards player Espen Stor√∏ decided to leave the band for personal reasons. In early 2006, Lasse Finbr√•ten (formerly of Norwegian progressive/power metal band Tritonus) joined the band, filling the vacant spot. During 2005 Circus Maximus went on their first tour with their major performance being in Atlanta in the United States where they played at the ProgPower festival. Circus Maximus then returned to the same festival the following year with their new keyboardist. During the rest of 2006 Circus Maximus continued to play gigs around Scandinavia with other major acts such as Kamelot, Pagan's Mind and Glenn Hughes. = Isolate (2007) = Circus Maximus spent the first quarter of 2007 recording their second studio album, Isolate, which was released on August 7, 2007. Before the release, as a response to impatient and expectant fans, the band established a post on the official Circus Maximus forum where they kept readers up-to-date on their studio-progress. Following the release of Isolate the band went on tour playing at major festivals such as ProgPower Europe, ProgPower Scandinavia, Sweden Rock and MetalHear. They also went on many solo shows while on the road. During February 13 to March 5, 2008 the band toured Europe as an opening act (along with German progressive metal band Dreamscape) at the Symphony X Paradise Lost Tour 2008. On November 18 the band posted this message in their website: \\"Circus Maximus will now be entering the studio to start the pre- production of the next album, planned to be released late 2010. We are writing new stuff everyday and so far we have more or less 8 songs completed for the album and we can honestly tell you it sounds AMAZING!

The station is situated at the junction of the West Kirby branch of the Wirral Line, which is part of the Merseyrail network, and with the Borderlands Line from Wrexham Central, operated by Transport for Wales. Bidston is the northern terminal of the Borderlands Line. History British Railways London Midland Region totem sign for Bidston station Bidston station has for most of its existence been primarily an interchange point between trains. The station is relatively isolated except for nearby Bidston Village, and was accessed only by foot. Until 1970, the approach road to the station was an unpaved track. Because of its isolation when a through station, the station closed twice due to poor passenger usage. Today there is an adjacent car park at the station with access to the nearby Junction One retail park via a lane. The station's prime function as an interchange still remains today. The station was originally built by the Hoylake Railway, opening on 2 July 1866 as an intermediate through station on their line from Birkenhead Dock to the east to Hoylake to the west. The Birkenhead Dock terminus was a tramway railway interchange station, with onward journeys to Birkenhead Woodside ferry by horse drawn street trams of the Wirral Tramway. The station first closed on 4 July 1870, reopening on 1 August 1872. In 1878 the Hoylake Railway line was extended to West Kirby on the River Dee coast to the west. In 1888 the line was extended to Birkenhead Park station. Birkenhead Park was an interchange station to Liverpool via the Mersey Railway. The old tramway interchange terminus at Birkenhead Dock station was converted to a goods station. The station was again closed in June 1890 due to low passenger numbers. The station was permanently reopened on 18 May 1896 as the northern terminus of the new North Wales and Liverpool Railway. The southern terminus was at Hawarden Bridge, which joined onto the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway line to Wrexham Central. In 1898 Bidston ceased to be a terminus station with the line extended to Seacombe in Wallasey. Bidston became a passenger interchange station. The station in 1961, facing towards Leasowe. The lines to the sidings and engine shed are in front of the signals to the left. Bidston Dee Junction signal box is behind the platform. Through trains to Liverpool commenced in 1938 when the London Midland and Scottish Railway electrified the line from Birkenhead Park to West Kirby. During the earlier half of the twentieth century, Bidston station was known as Bidston Dee Junction and was a busy interchange between the Wirral line electric services and the Seacombe to Wrexham and Chester Northgate steam trains. In 1960 the Wrexham service changed to diesel trains. At the same time the northern terminus of the line was diverted further north to terminate at New Brighton due to the closure of Seacombe station. The section of line from Bidston to New Brighton was closed in 1971 due to poor passenger use with the line from Wrexham terminating at Birkenhead North. However it was subsequently cut back to Bidston and again the station became a terminus on the Borderlands Line in October 1978 and this remains the situation today. The section of curve between Bidston West and North Junctions, on the wye to the east of the station, was severed on 28 November 1983. This removed the direct route to New Brighton for passengers, and Bidston Dock for freight. =Signal boxes= Bidston had four signal boxes in 1899. These signal boxes were situated alongside the Dee, West, East and North junctions. The nearest to the station was the Bidston Dee Junction box. The second Dee Junction signal box was built in the 1930s by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and was much larger than the earlier signal box which had been built by the Wirral Railway. This signal box had a 65-lever frame and also took over the operation of Bidston North Junction, when built. Bidston Dee Junction signal box was closed on 17 September 1994, and demolished two months later on 20 November. =Engine shed and freight use= Bidston station had a nearby engine shed, shed code 6F, which principally operated the Wrexham line. The building was somewhat south of the running lines, halfway between Bidston and Birkenhead North stations. The shed was built by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway in 1897 and had two tracks inside. The shed had a water tank and a coaling stage for steam locomotives. Examples of locomotives, which could be found at the shed, included the LNER Class J94 Austerity, which was used around the Birkenhead docks, and the BR Standard Class 9F, which hauled iron ore trains from Bidston Dock to the John Summers steelworks in Shotton. The engine shed closed on 11 February 1963, along with transfer of its allocation of locomotives to Birkenhead Mollington Street depot. The shed remained intact for several years after closure. Several sidings were situated adjacent to the eastern side of the station, south of the running lines. These sidings had been built prior to 1899, and were removed after goods traffic ended on 29 July 1968. A Tesco supermarket now occupies the site of these sidings. The station was the nearest to the former Bidston Dock. The adjacent Bidston East Junction gives access to the former Birkenhead Dock Branch line, but this has been disused by freight workings since the mid-1980s and is still so at present. Facilities The station has a booking office, shelter and toilet facilities. Each side of the island platform can receive six carriages. The station is staffed at all times during opening hours, and has platform CCTV. Each platform has open-air seating. There is a payphone, next to the ticket office, on platform 1.Station Facilities for Bidston Accessed 2013-12-17 The station provides a \\"Park and Ride\\" service. There are a further 198 car parking spaces,Bidston train station facilities, Merseyrail Accessed 2013-12-18 which are free to use for travellers, with lighting columns and CCTV to meet Merseytravel's Travelsafe requirements. Construction of the new car park was completed in 2010. There is no access to the platform for passengers with wheelchairs or prams, as access is by staircase only. In early 2014 a new waiting shelter opened which includes a new ticket office, new seating and a new toilet. On 3 August 2015, a new Bike & Go shelter opened at the station.New Bike & Go Shelter This provides secure cycle storage for 28 cycles. Services An Arriva Trains Wales service, waiting to depart to Wrexham General on platform 2. The platform is also used by Merseyrail services to West Kirby Currently, services run every 15 minutes (Monday to Saturday daytime) to West Kirby & Liverpool, and every hour to Wrexham. Services to and from Wrexham usually terminate/start from platform 2, which is also used by West Kirby trains. Liverpool-bound trains use platform 1. During the evenings, trains operate every 30 minutes to West Kirby & Liverpool and every two hours to Wrexham (all day on Bank Holidays), with a service approximately every 90 minutes on Sundays.GB National Rail Timetable 2016, Table 101 Merseyrail services are provided by Merseyrail's fleet of Class 507 and Class 508 EMUs.

Dispensers vary widely based on the tape they dispense. Abundant and most common, clear tape dispensers (like those used in an office or at home) are commonly made of plastic, and may be disposable. Other dispensers are stationary and may have sophisticated features to control tape usage and improve ergonomics.  History  Prior to the development of the tape dispenser, 3M's standard clear scotch tape was sold as a roll, and had to be carefully peeled from the end and cut with scissors. To make the product more useful, the scotch tape sales manager at 3M, John Borden, designed the first tape dispenser in 1932, which had a built- in cutting mechanism and would hold the cut end of the tape until its next use. Handheld dispenser A clear case tape dispenser A handheld dispenser is a variation of handheld tape dispenser used to apply tape to close boxes, etc. Some refer to it as a \\"tape gun\\". Some dispensers are small enough so that the dispenser, with the tape in it, can be taken to the point of application for operator ease. The dispenser allows for a convenient cut-off and helps the operator apply (and sometimes helps rub down) the tape. Tabletop dispensers =Pull-and-tear= Tabletop or desk dispensers are frequently used to hold the tape and allow the operator to pull off the desired amount, tear the tape off, and take the tape to the job. = Stationary electronic tape dispenser = Tabletop dispensers are available with electrical assists to dispense and cut pressure-sensitive tape to a predetermined length. They are often used in an industrial setting to increase productivity along manufacturing or assembly lines. They eliminate the need to manually measure and cut each individual piece of tape on high volumes of product or packaging. By automating this process, automatic tape dispensers reduce material waste caused by human error. They also reduce the time needed to cut each piece of tape, therefore reducing labor costs and increasing productivity. Automated equipment A semi-automatic box sealing machine. Some taping machinery is semi-automatic: the operator takes an object and puts it in or through a machine which automatically applies the tape. This helps save time and controls the consumption of tape. Fully automatic equipment is available which does not require an operator. All functions can be automated. High speed packaging machinery is an example of highly automated equipment.  Gummed (water-activated) tape dispenser  Gummed (water activated) tape dispensers measure, dispense, moisten, and cut gummed or water-activated adhesive tape. This tape is often composed of a paper backing and adhesive glue that is unable to adhere until it is \\"activated\\" by contact with water. To perform this step, gummed dispensers often employ a water bottle and wetting brush to moisten each piece of tape as it is dispensed. Many gummed dispensers feature a heater, which is mounted over the feed area to maintain the dispenser‚Äôs water temperature. These heaters ensure maximum wetting, and are ideal in cold climates. Gummed tape dispensers are often used in packaging or shipping departments for closing corrugated boxes.

The Statesman benefits from the culture and writing heritage of Austin. It extensively covers the music scene, especially the annual South by Southwest Music Festival. The newspaper co-sponsors Austin events such as the Capital 10K, one of the largest 10K runs in the U.S., and the Season for Caring charity campaign. In the Austin market, the Statesman competes with the Austin Chronicle, an alternative weekly. The Statesman also publishes a weekly Spanish-language newspaper, ¬°ahora s√≠!. Additionally, the Statesman partners with the St. Petersburg Times for PolitiFact Texas, which covers issues that are relevant to Texas and the Austin area. Circulation In 2009, the Austin American-Statesman ranked 60th in circulation among daily newspapers, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Figures from Scarborough Research show the Statesman ‚Äî in print and online ‚Äì reaches 68% of Central Texans in an average week. Following a national trend among daily newspapers, the Statesman has seen circulation declines in recent years. Austin is one of America's most Internet-connected cities, though not ranked in the 25 largest \\"connected\\" cities, and, in a related trend, the Statesman's daily circulation ranks among those cities seeing drops of 5% or more in recent reports. As compared to a U.S. national decline of 2.1%, the Statesman's daily circulation in the most recent six-month reporting period fell 5.6% to 173,527. Its Sunday circulation fell 5.5% to 215,984. Austin is the 11th largest city (and the 35th largest metropolitan area) in the U.S. Politics The Statesman endorsed George W. Bush in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, and Republican governor Rick Perry along with every other Republican incumbent in 2006. In the 2008 presidential election, however, the paper endorsed Barack Obama. The Statesman also provides coverage of Libertarian Party and Green Party matters. History Founded as the tri- weeklyOnce every three weeks. Democratic Statesman in 1871, the newspaper was originally allied with the state Democratic party during Reconstruction. It began daily publication as a morning paper in 1873. After absorbing the Austin Tribune in 1914, it published as the afternoon Austin Statesman and Tribune, then became an evening paper and changed its name to the Austin Evening Statesman in 1916. A rival paper, the morning Austin American, began in 1914. Waco-based newspapermen Charles E. Marsh and E.S. Fentress bought the American in 1919 and the Evening Statesman in 1924. Merged under one company, the morning and evening papers published separately during the week and combined for a Sunday Austin American Statesman edition. The company continued separate titles until 1973, when all products became the American-Statesman, with four editions daily. Cox Enterprises acquired the Statesman when it bought the Waco newspaper company in 1976. In 1987, the Statesman moved to morning-only publication. In 2008, Cox put the Statesman up for sale with most of its other newspaper holdings in order to pay down debt. A year later, the company pulled the paper off the market, citing a lack of suitable offers. The newspaper was part of the subsidiary Cox Media Group, which joined the corporation's television, radio and newspaper assets under one umbrella in 2008. The Statesman was named Texas Associated Press Managing Editors Newspaper of the Year in 2013, 2014 and 2016, besting Houston, San Antonio and Dallas. In 2015, ¬°Ahora S√≠! was named the best Spanish-language newspaper in the country for its circulation size by the National Association of Hispanic Publishers. http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/statesmans-ahora-si-publication-wins- multiple-jose/nn8dQ/ On March 6, 2018, the sale of the Statesman to GateHouse Media from Cox Media Group was announced. Upon taking over in April, GateHouse said the Statesman would be the \\"flagship\\" of the expanding chain, noting its existing 240-employee design and editing hub in Austin.

The poem was included in Ballads and Other Poems (1842), which also included other well-known poems such as \\"The Wreck of the Hesperus\\" \\"Excelsior\\" is a short poem written in 1841 by American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Overview The poem describes a young man passing through a mountain village. He bears the banner \\"Excelsior\\" (translated from Latin as \\"higher\\", also loosely but more widely as \\"onward and upward\\"). The traveller disregards warnings from villagers of fearful dangers above, and an offer of rest from a local maiden. The youth climbs higher until a last distant cry interrupts the prayers of the monks of Saint Bernard. \\"Lifeless, but beautiful\\" he is found by the \\"faithful hound\\" half-buried in the snow, \\"still clasping in his hands of ice that banner with the strange device, Excelsior!\\" Longfellow's first draft of \\"Excelsior\\", now in the Harvard University Library, notes that he finished the poem at three o'clock in the morning on September 28, 1841.Cahoon, Herbert; Lange, Thomas V.; Ryskamp, Charles (1977). American Literary Autographs, from Washington Irving to Henry James, Courier Dover Publications, 34. . The poem came to him as he was trying to sleep. \\"That voice kept ringing in my ears\\", as he wrote to his friend Samuel Gray Ward, which caused him to get up and write the poem immediately.Gale, Robert L (2003).

VII no. 2, January 22, 1842.Vol. VII No. 1 and No. 2 of Jan 8 and 22 were issued with wrong year of 1841 on the masthead of the Courant Supplement. It was also included in Longfellow's collection Ballads and Other Poems in 1842. The title of Excelsior was reportedly inspired by the state seal of New York, which bears the Latin motto Excelsior. Longfellow had seen it earlier on a scrap of newspaper.Calhoun, Charles C. (2005). Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston, MA: Beacon Press: 140. . Longfellow explained the repeated title as from the Latin, Scopus meus excelsior est (\\"my goal is higher\\"). Biographer Charles Calhoun suggested the Alpine setting was an autobiographical reference to the poet's then-unsuccessful wooing of Frances Appleton, daughter of industrialist Nathan Appleton.Calhoun, Charles C. (2005). Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston, MA: Beacon Press: 142. . Adaptations and parodies The popularity of \\"Excelsior\\" inspired many parodies, adaptations, and references in other media. The poem was set to music as a duet for tenor and baritone by the Irish composer Michael William Balfe, and became a staple of Victorian and Edwardian drawing rooms. Longfellow's acquaintance Franz Liszt composed an adaptation as a prelude to his longer Longfellow adaptation of The Golden Legend. He began writing it for Baroness von Meyendorff in 1869; it premiered in Budapest on March 10, 1875.Merrick, Paul (1987). Revolution and Religion in the Music of Liszt. Cambridge University Press, 235. A Plea for Old Cap Collier by Irvin S. Cobb, satirized it. His description is partly based on an illustration used in the readers. The words quoted are Longfellow's: > : The shades of night were falling fast, : As through an Alpine village > passed : A youth, who bore, 'mid snow and ice, : A banner with the strange > device, : Excelsior! There is a Lancashire version or parody, Uppards, written by Marriott Edgar one hundred years later in 1941. James Thurber (1894‚Äì1961) illustrated the poem in Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated in 1945. Thurber chose nine poems for the series, including John Greenleaf Whittier's \\"Barbara Frietchie\\" and Rose Hartwick Thorpe's \\"Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight\\".Grauer, Neil A.

In Bullwinkle's Corner, Bullwinkle the Moose parodies the poem in Season 2 Episode 18 (1960‚Äì61) of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show: > : The answer came both quick and blunt: : It's just an advertising stunt. : > I represent Smith, Jones, & Jakes, : A lumber company that makes... : > Excelsior!\\"Bullwinkle's Corner - Excelsior,\\" YouTube The poem is the base for the motto of Wynberg Allen School in Mussorie, India. It is also the name and motto for the Brampton, Ontario, Canada box lacrosse teams. In 1871 Mr. George Lee, a Brampton High School teacher introduced lacrosse to the town. He proposed the name \\"Excelsior\\", which he took from Longfellow's poem. In 1883 the Brampton Excelsiors Lacrosse Club was officially formed. The name has been used for all levels of box lacrosse in Brampton ever since. Sam Loyd's chess problem Excelsior was named for this poem.

Thomas and his wife, Frances Browne Stewart (1794-1872), emigrated to Canada with their children and Thomas brother-in-law and former business partner, Robert Reid, and his family. The party of 27 set sail from Belfast Lough on June 1, 1822. Seven weeks were spent on the ship before reaching Quebec. From Quebec they travelled to Kingston, and then on to York, where Stewart and Reid were each granted , provided they settled in an township. Douro Township in Peterborough County was suggested as a promising region. On September 9, 1822, Stewart and Reid travelled to the area with surveyor Richard Birdsall, and each chose land on the Otonabee River. Thomas and Frances developed their home, \\"Auburn,\\" on Lot 2, Concession XII, raising a family of 10 children to adulthood and assisting other settlers. Thomas Stewart became a prominent and influential citizen in the area until his death in 1847 from typhoid fever. The school opened in 1967 as Thomas A.

It features former Kingdom Come and Wild Horses members Rick Steier and James Kottak who came in to replace original band members Joey Allen and Steven Sweet. Musical style Ultraphobic saw Warrant acknowledging the Grunge phenomenon with a record that openly admitted to a Seattle influence, although it was still a natural progression from the hard edged Dog Eat Dog. It is vaguely similar to Danger Danger's Dawn, which was also released in 1995. In particular, the record represented an experimentation with the grunge sounds which had by this time become popular, and which, ironically, had contributed to the band's commercial demise. In songs such as \\"Undertow\\" and \\"Followed\\" the band attempted to mix pop metal sounds with the alternative stylings of Seattle bands such as Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. Production and marketing Warrant began recording Ultraphobic in November 1994 with producer Beau Hill. The band supported the release of the record with a national tour beginning in Dallas, Texas. A music video was made for the first single \\"Family Picnic\\" with a strong message against family violence and for the second single \\"Stronger Now\\", which Jani Lane refers to as the best song he has ever written. \\"Followed\\" was released as the third single of the album.

For example, a hyphenation algorithm might decide that impeachment can be broken as impeach-ment or im-peachment but not impe-achment. One of the reasons for the complexity of the rules of word-breaking is that different \\"dialects\\" of English tend to differ on hyphenation: American English tends to work on sound, but British English tends to look to the origins of the word and then to sound. There are also a large number of exceptions, which further complicates matters. Some rules of thumb can be found in the Major Keary's: \\"On Hyphenation ‚Äì Anarchy of Pedantry.\\" Among the algorithmic approaches to hyphenation, the one implemented in the TeX typesetting system is widely used. It is thoroughly documented in the first two volumes of Computers and Typesetting and in Franklin Mark Liang's dissertation. The aim of Liang's work was to get the algorithm as accurate as he practically could and to keep any exception dictionary small. In TeX's original hyphenation patterns for American English, the exception list contains only 14 words.  In TeX  Ports of the TeX hyphenation algorithm are available as libraries for several programming languages, including Haskell, JavaScript, Perl, PostScript, Python, Ruby, C#, and TeX can be made to show hyphens in the log by the command \`showhyphens\`. In LaTeX, hyphenation correction can be added by users by using: hyphenation{words} The \`hyphenation\` command declares allowed hyphenation points in which words is a list of words, separated by spaces, in which each hyphenation point is indicated by a \`-\` character. For example, hyphenation{fortran er-go-no-mic} declares that in the current job \\"fortran\\" should not be hyphenated and that if \\"ergonomic\\" must be hyphenated, it will be at one of the indicated points. However, there are several limits.

Forming in October during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, it strengthened over waters thought to be too cold for tropical development. Vince was the twentieth named tropical cyclone and twelfth hurricane of the extremely active season. Vince developed from an extratropical system on 8 October, becoming a subtropical storm southeast of the Azores. The United States National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not officially name the storm until the next day, shortly before Vince became a hurricane. The storm weakened at sea and made an extremely rare landfall on the Iberian Peninsula as a tropical depression on 11 October. Vince was one of only three tropical systems to do so, alongside the 1842 Spanish hurricane and Subtropical Storm Alpha of 2020. It dissipated over Spain, bringing much-needed rain to the region, and its remnants passed into the Mediterranean Sea.  Meteorological history  On 5 October, an operationally unnamed subtropical storm which had gone unnoticed by the NHC was absorbed by a temperate frontal low, which was moving to the southeast over the Azores. The low pressure system gained a more concentrated circulation and lost its frontal structure after absorbing the subtropical storm. The developing system became a subtropical storm itself early on the 8th of October southeast of Lajes in the Azores. However, the NHC decided not to name the system Vince at the time, because the water temperature was too low for normal development for a tropical cyclone. The storm gradually gained the tropical characteristics of symmetry and a warm inner core and became a tropical storm the next day. Its transformation to a tropical system occurred over water cooler than , much colder than the usually required for tropical development. Soon after it became a tropical storm on 9 October near Madeira, with a ragged eye already present, the NHC officially named it Tropical Storm Vince and began to issue advisories. At the time there was some uncertainty as to whether Vince was tropical or subtropical but, in his post-season analysis, forecaster James L. Franklin of the NHC conceded that Vince had formed as a subtropical storm and had evolved into a tropical storm before it was named. The storm's ragged eye quickly solidified and contracted into a \\"bona fide\\" eye with a diameter of . This increase in organization was accompanied by strengthening, and Vince reached its peak strength as a hurricane with winds later that day. The NHC forecasters decided that \\"if it looks like a hurricane, it probably is, despite its environment and unusual location\\". Tropical Depression Vince over the Iberian Peninsula on 11 October Hurricane Vince's impressive organization was very short lived as westerly wind shear began to erode the eye within hours. In response, the storm weakened to a tropical storm shortly thereafter. A broad low-level trough approached the storm from the northwest, pulling the convection northward as the storm's low- level center accelerated eastward. On 10 October, two brief bursts of convection surprised forecasters, but with the sea surface temperature as low as , the flares were not sustained. Vince continued to weaken as it approached the Iberian Peninsula and became a tropical depression on 11 October, shortly before it made landfall near Huelva, Spain. The fast-moving tropical depression quickly dissipated over land. Its remnants moved across southern Spain, dumping rain on the drought-ridden region, and moved into the Mediterranean Sea south of Alicante in the early hours of 12 October.  Preparations and impact  C√≥rdoba, Spain was one of many that benefited from Hurricane Vince's unseasonable rainfall. The Spanish Center for Emergency Coordination declared a rain pre-emergency for the province of Castell√≥n in the anticipation that Hurricane Vince would bring rains capable of flooding. The Instituto Nacional de Meteorolog√≠a (INM) issued a bulletin that warned of a 40% chance of flooding. Four Spanish autonomous communities (Asturias, Catalonia, Castile and Le√≥n, and Galicia) issued flood warnings, and Canarias issued a wind warning. Spanish fishing fleets off the Andalusian coast returned to port and weathered the storm on their moorings rather than in the open ocean. Spain's population, which had been battling fires after a record breaking summer drought, welcomed the rains brought by Vince's remnants. In two days the storm brought more rain to the province of A Coru√±a than had fallen all summer, easing the sinking water levels in provincial reservoirs, but also causing traffic jams and minor floods. In C√≥rdoba province, the A-303, A-306 and CO-293 roads were partially flooded but \\"passable with caution\\". Municipal roadworks on La Ronda de Poniente, a major traffic artery connecting the city to nearby motorways, were flooded and partially destroyed. The entrance of the University of A Coru√±a was temporarily blocked by flood waters on 11 October, and a nearby roundabout was submerged. These damages were minor, and no fatalities were reported. The highest winds reported on land were at Jerez, Spain, although some ships recorded stronger. Vince was comparable to normal rain events from temperate systems, with only of rain falling. Through a play on words of a song in the musical My Fair Lady, National Hurricane Center forecaster James Franklin in the Tropical Cyclone Report for Vince wrote, \\"the rain in Spain was mainly less than 2 inches, although 3.30 inches fell in the plain at C√≥rdoba.\\"  Records and naming  Hurricane Vince on 9 October, northwest of the Madeira Islands. For comparison, the main island of the Madeiras (the largest island pictured) is approximately 35 miles (57 km) long. Although Hurricane Vince developed in an unusual location in the northeastern Atlantic, well away from where tropical cyclones are usually found, it is neither the northernmost forming nor the easternmost forming Atlantic tropical cyclone; these records are held by an unnamed tropical storm of the 1952 season at 42.0¬∞ N, and Alpha of the 2020 season at 9.3¬∞ W, respectively. Hurricane Vince developed into a hurricane farther east than any other known storm at the time, at 18.9¬∞ W. This record was broken by Hurricane Pablo in 2019, at 18.3¬∞ W. The National Hurricane Center declared that Vince was the first tropical cyclone on record to have made landfall on the Iberian Peninsula. Historical documents, however, suggest that a possibly stronger tropical storm, the 1842 Spain hurricane, struck the Iberian Peninsula on 29 October 1842. When Subtropical Storm Vince formed on 8 October it marked the first time in recorded history that a 21st tropical or subtropical storm had ever developed within a single Atlantic hurricane season, surpassing the 20 storms of the 1933 season. Hurricane Vince was also the first named \\"V\\" storm in the Atlantic since naming began in 1950. It would be 15 years until another season would have a V-named stormTropical Storm Vicky in 2020. That same season, Tropical Storm Wilfred beated Vince as the earliest 21st named storm in a season, forming 20 days earlier.

Passenger train services are operated by Transport for Wales between the southern terminal of Wrexham Central and Bidston in the north. Bidston is an interchange station for Merseyrail services to Liverpool and West Kirby. Trains run every hour Monday to Saturday daytime, every two hours after 18:45 and on Sundays. Connections with other National Rail services are at Bidston (changing for Merseyrail services to West Kirby, Birkenhead and Liverpool Lime Street for London and long haul national routes), Shotton (change for Chester and London trains and the North Wales Coast line) and Wrexham General (for the Shrewsbury‚ÄìChester line). The line is also referred to as the Mid Wirral line, as most of the line runs north‚Äìsouth through the middle of the Wirral peninsula. The line is to introduce bi-modal battery electric diesel trains in 2020.https://www.railtech.com/rolling-stock/2020/01/27/vivarail-certifies-uks- first-battery-powered-train/ The Wirral's other railway routes are provided with frequent Merseyrail electric trains. The Borderlands line has a service of one train per hour. From 2021 the service will improve to two trains per hour using fully refurbished ex-London Underground D78 stock trains, classified as Class 230, with primarily battery power plants with a diesel engine as a fail-safe.http://tfw.gov.wales/whats-happening-north- waleshttp://www.wrexham.com/news/refurbed-london-underground-trains-for- wrexham-to-bidston-service-keolis-uk-to-move-hq-to-wales-150386.html Holders of the Concessionary Travel Pass resident in Wrexham and Flintshire can travel free along part of the line, from Wrexham Central Station to Hawarden Bridge Station. Holders of the Merseytravel Concessionary Travel Pass can travel free along the section of the line that runs through Merseyside, from Heswall Station to Bidston Station. Passenger services The service is normally operated with Class 150 trains. It was formerly operated by Class 153s, Class 101s, and Class 142s. In October 2006, the operator moved to using Class 150s or paired Class 153 units. The latter disappeared in favour of the Class 150s in December 2006. =Community rail= This is designated as a community rail partnership. The franchise Upon privatisation, passenger services were transferred from Regional Railways to North West Trains, later known as First North Western. In 2003, a review led to the creation of the All-Wales Franchise, meaning services were transferred to Wales & Borders Trains. Arriva Trains Wales succeeded Wales & Borders on 8 December 2003, and operated all passenger services on the line until October 2018, when Transport for Wales began its 15 franchise. Future electrification plans could see the line transfer to Merseyrail. Infrastructure history Borderlands line The southern part of the line was built by the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway (WMCQR) in 1864 and the northern part by the North Wales and Liverpool Railway, a joint committee of the WMCQR and the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway in 1896. The North Wales and Liverpool Railway northern terminus was at Bidston with the southern terminus at Hawarden Bridge Both railways were acquired by the Great Central Railway on 1 January 1905. Two Wirral stations on the line closed in the 1950s; Storeton in 1951 and Burton Point in 1955. No trace of the station at Storeton remains, yet Burton Point station is still almost entirely intact, the station buildings currently forming part of a garden centre. Further south, the high level platforms of Hope Exchange closed in 1958. The northern terminal of the Borderlands Line has been at four different stations at various times: Bidston, Birkenhead North, Birkenhead Park (briefly in the late 60s), New Brighton and Seacombe.http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/s/seacombe/http://www.disused- stations.org.uk/features/bidston/index.shtml Development The doubling of the journey frequency on the line is one of the aims of the Growth Track 360 group, a consortium of business, politicians and public sector leaders. The group aims to improve transport and create jobs in the North Wales, Merseyside and Cheshire area over the next 20 years. During the 2017 Autumn budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond stated that part of the additional ¬£1.2 billion funding Wales was receiving would be used to look into proposals to improve journey times on the line and developing a business case. =Proposed new stations= New stations at Deeside Industrial Park, Woodchurch and Beechwood have been proposed. The route was mentioned in Merseytravel's proposed 30-year plan of 2014. :\\"New stations at Beechwood and Woodchurch in Birkenhead (the latter \\"would be around junction 3 of the M53, the Prenton/Oxton side\\") and Deeside Industrial Park. These changes would \\"Incorporate the line into the Merseyrail Wirral line to provide direct connectivity with Liverpool city centre.\\" The draft of the Network Rail Welsh Route Study in March 2015 contained several suggestions for improving services on the line, including:. * Replacing the High and Low levels at Shotton station with a dedicated interchange station, improving connectivity between the North Wales Coast Main Line & the Borderlands line * The removal of level crossings to improve line speed. =Proposed electrification= Proposals exist to electrify a section or all of the line with incorporation into the Wirral line of the Merseyrail network, allowing through services to the underground sections of Birkenhead and Liverpool and onwards to Liverpool John Lennon Airport. A study conducted by Network Rail in 2008, investigated the costs of extending the Merseyrail network third-rail electrification to Wrexham. However, when the cost was estimated at ¬£207 million, Merseytravel stated that cheaper overhead-wire electrification would also be considered announcing a lower estimated figure of ¬£66 million. This scheme would require dual-voltage trains with third-rail and overhead-wire capability. Network Rail's conclusion was that full line electrification is only feasible if it could be delivered for less than ¬£100,000 for each km per single track. The twin track line would be ¬£200,000 per line km, giving a total figure of ¬£8.7 million, which is far below the estimate of full line electrification of ¬£66 million. Another consideration is whether a new pattern of service delivers significant net benefits. Political pressure to electrify the line has been ongoing. The Welsh Government is pressing for improved rail connections between North Wales and Liverpool which may accelerate the electrification of the line. Merseytravel Committee Chairman, Councillor Liam Robinson, revealed in 2016 that a working group had been set up to examine improving the line. It is believed that by increasing the frequency of trains, the number of passengers will increase making the case for electrification stronger. Merseytravel expect that frequency improvements on the line will be delivered as part of CP6, which has a potential delivery timescale of up to 2024. Councillor Robinson revealed in an interview in 2017 that passenger use on the line had increased 75% over the previous decade but electrification was still a long-term aspiration. He also stated that the new rolling stock that was being procured for Merseyrail could be utilised to run on the line. =Proposed battery trains= Class 230 battery (hybrid) trains are to be introduced in 2020 Inside the refurbished trains The operation of battery trains that receive energy from batteries and an electric pick-up has been proposed for operation on unelectrified and electrified sections of the track. Adoption of these types of trains would reduce the need for full line electrification. A trial of a converted Electrostar train using energy from overhead wires and batteries when on non- electrified sections of track was undertaken in January and February 2015 on the Mayflower line. The train travelled up to 60 miles on energy stored in the batteries also recharging the batteries via the overhead-wires when on electrified track, at stations and via brake regeneration. A month later in March 2015, the introduction of battery powered trains was proposed for the Borderlands line by Network Rail. The Network Rail document suggested that consideration had been given to electrification and to extending the terminus from Bidston further into Birkenhead for greater connectivity. However these options were expressed as offering low value for money. The document proposes that using battery powered rolling stock precluding full electrification of the line, provides a cheaper method of increasing connectivity and extending the service into the electrified Birkenhead and Liverpool sections of the Wirral line. From the document: :\\"In the longer term, potential deployment of rolling stock with the ability to operate on battery power for part of their journey may provide the ability in an affordable manner to improve the service offering between the Wrexham ‚Äì Bidston route and Liverpool.\\" It was announced in June 2018 that refurbished Class 230 former London Underground D78 stock trains with battery power plants and a diesel engine as a failsafe, are to be introduced between Wrexham and Bidston.http://www.keolisamey.cymru/media/1046/ams-wb-overview- presentation.pdf http://www.wrexham.com/news/refurbed-london-underground- trains-for-wrexham-to-bidston-service-keolis-uk-to-move-hq-to- wales-150386.html The trains were passed for passenger use for 2020 introduction.https://www.railtech.com/rolling-stock/2020/01/27/vivarail- certifies-uks-first-battery-powered-train/ There is an intention to extend from Bidston onto the Merseyrail Wirral Line taking trains into the Liverpool and Birkenhead underground sections on electrified 3rd rail track using bimodal trains with a 3rd rail pickup.http://www.leaderlive.co.uk/news/wrexham/16275359.Wrexham_to_Bidston_railway_line_will_be_39_greatly_improved39under_new_plans/ References External links *Official website *Detailed map of the line *The Wrexham to Bidston railway: 'The Borderland line' Railway lines in Wales Transport in Wrexham County Borough Rail transport in Merseyside Railway lines in North West England Standard gauge railways in Wales Standard gauge railways in England Community railway lines in England Community railway lines in Wales ","title":"Borderlands line"},{"id":"2842207","title":"Battle of Bad Axe"},{"id":"2842211","text":"Berwind is a census-designated place on the Dry Fork in McDowell County, West Virginia, United States.

It has long been thought that Senepol originated from crosses between N'Dama cattle, imported in the late 19th century, and Red Poll cattle, but it is actually an admixed breed between a European taurina (Red Poll) zebu. The Senepol breed combines characteristics of heat tolerance and insect resistance with the docile nature, good meat, and high milk production of the Red Poll. They are polled, short haired, and colored red, black or brown. Breed history Being better suited to the island's climatic conditions than European breeds, it was reported that 60 heifers and two bulls of the N'Dama Petite breed were imported to St. Croix from Senegal in 1860 by George Elliot. This became the nucleus of the N'Dama cattle herd on St. Croix and by 1889, Henry C. Nelthropp, at the Granard Estates, was one of the largest N'Dama breeders with 250 purebred cattle. In 1918 Henry's son, Bromley, bought a Red Poll bull from Trinadad (which originated in England) to improve the cows' milking ability and remove their long horns. Two of this bull's sons were used as herd sires. In 1942 another Red Poll bull was purchased, this time from St. Thomas, and two locally raised purebred Red Poll cows were added to the herd.History and Development of Senepol Cattle by H. D. Hupp - Agricultural Experiment Station - College of the Virgin Islands - Report 11 - April 1978 Mason's World Dictionary of Livestock Breeds, Types and Varieties - 5th Edition - 2002 - Page 104 The admixed cattle were selected for solid red color, natural polling and heat tolerance. These offspring were dispersed to four main herds on the island. The name Senepol was adopted in 1954 and a breed registry was established in the late 1960s. Aided by the United States Department of Agriculture the College of the Virgin Islands Extension Service began on farm performance testing in 1976. In 1977 22 cows were taken to the United States and the breed has since spread across the southern states. There are now more than 500 breeders with more than 14,000 registered cattle. They are also found in Australia, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Venezuela, Mexico, Paraguay, Philippines, Zimbabwe, Brazil, Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic.Oklahoma State University breed profileSenepol Cattle Breeders Association Genetic characterization However, genetic characterization using high throughput SNP genotyping recently demonstrated that the Senepol genome contains crosses between European taurine (such as Red Poll) with some Zebu influence. The study showed that genetic samples of Senepol DNA collected from four different regions of Venezuela contained an average of 89% European taurine ancestry (ranging from 66‚Äì95%), 10.4% Zebu ancestry (ranging from 4‚Äì33%) and 0.6% African taurine ancestry (ranging from 0‚Äì4.1%).Flori et al 2012, PLoS ONE, 10.1371 Among the African taurine breeds is the N'Dama breed from West Africa.Mason's World Dictionary of Livestock Breeds, Types and Varieties - 5th Edition - 2002 - Page 85 Disease and insect resistance USDA research indicates that Senepol have greater immune response when compared to other beef breeds. This is likely due to the Bos indicus influence in Senepol, and is also aided by generations of natural selection being applied on the island of St. Croix. In the 1950s, with sugar cane becoming less economic, the United States Department of Agriculture put resources into the teaching of scientific breeding under Richard Marshall Bond. This was covered in an article on the Virgin Islands in the February 1956 National Geographic. References External links * History and Development of Senepol Cattle by H. D.

Microforms are scaled-down reproductions of documents, typically either films or paper, made for the purposes of transmission, storage, reading, and printing. Microform images are commonly reduced to about 4% or one twenty-fifth of the original document size. For special purposes, greater optical reductions may be used. All microform images may be provided as positives or negatives, more often the latter. Three formats are common: microfilm (reels), microfiche (flat sheets), and aperture cards. Microcards, also known as \\"micro-opaques\\", a format no longer produced, were similar to microfiche, but printed on cardboard rather than photographic film. History Using the daguerreotype process, John Benjamin Dancer was one of the first to produce microphotographs, in 1839. He achieved a reduction ratio of 160:1. Dancer refined his reduction procedures with Frederick Scott Archer's wet collodion process, developed in 1850‚Äì51, but he dismissed his decades-long work on microphotographs as a personal hobby and did not document his procedures. The idea that microphotography could be no more than a novelty was an opinion shared in the 1858 Dictionary of Photography, which called the process \\"somewhat trifling and childish\\". Originally published in Dictionary of Photography (1858). Microphotography was first suggested as a document preservation method in 1851 by the astronomer James Glaisher, and in 1853 by John Herschel, another astronomer. Both men attended the 1851 Great Exhibition in London, where the exhibit on photography greatly influenced Glaisher. He called it \\"the most remarkable discovery of modern times\\", and argued in his official report for using microphotography to preserve documents.Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations 1851.

A pigeon post was in operation while Paris was besieged during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871. The chemist Charles-Louis Barreswil proposed the application of photographic methods with prints of a reduced size. The prints were on photographic paper and did not exceed 40 mm, to permit insertion in the pigeon's quill. The developments in microphotography continued through the next decades, but it was not until the turn of the century that its potential for practical usage was applied more broadly. In 1896, Canadian engineer Reginald A. Fessenden suggested microforms were a compact solution to engineers' unwieldy but frequently consulted materials. He proposed that up to 150,000,000 words could be made to fit in a square inch, and that a one-foot cube could contain 1.5 million volumes. In 1906, Paul Otlet and Robert Goldschmidt proposed the livre microphotographique as a way to alleviate the cost and space limitations imposed by the codex format.Robert Goldschmidt and Paul Otlet, Sur une forme nouvelle du livre‚Äî le livre microphotographique, L'Institut international de bibliographie, Bulletin, 1907. Otlet's overarching goal was to create a World Center Library of Juridical, Social and Cultural Documentation, and he saw microfiche as a way to offer a stable and durable format that was inexpensive, easy to use, easy to reproduce, and extremely compact. In 1925, the team spoke of a massive library where each volume existed as master negatives and positives, and where items were printed on demand for interested patrons.Robert B. Goldschmidt and Paul Otlet, \\"La Conseration et la Diffusion Internationale de la Pens√©e.\\" Publication no. 144 of the Institut International de Bibliographie (Brussels). In the 1920s microfilm began to be used in a commercial setting. New York City banker George McCarthy was issued a patent in 1925 for his \\"Checkograph\\" machine, designed to make micrographic copies of cancelled checks for permanent storage by financial institutions. In 1928, the Eastman Kodak Company bought McCarthy's invention and began marketing check microfilming devices under its \\"Recordak\\" division.\\"Brief History of Microfilm,\\" Heritage Microfilm, 2015. Between 1927 and 1935, the Library of Congress microfilmed more than three million pages of books and manuscripts in the British Library; in 1929 the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies joined to create a Joint Committee on Materials for Research, chaired for most of its existence by Robert C. Binkley, which looked closely at microform's potential to serve small print runs of academic or technical materials. In 1933, Charles C. Peters developed a method to microformat dissertations, and in 1934 the United States National Agriculture Library implemented the first microform print-on-demand service, which was quickly followed by a similar commercial concern, Science Service. In 1935, Kodak's Recordak division began filming and publishing The New York Times on reels of 35 millimeter microfilm, ushering in the era of newspaper preservation on film. This method of information storage received the sanction of the American Library Association at its annual meeting in 1936, when it officially endorsed microforms. Harvard University Library was the first major institution to realize the potential of microfilm to preserve broadsheets printed on high-acid newsprint and it launched its \\"Foreign Newspaper Project\\" to preserve such ephemeral publications in 1938. Roll microfilm proved far more satisfactory as a storage medium than earlier methods of film information storage, such as the Photoscope, the Film-O-Graph, the Fiske-O-Scope, and filmslides. The year 1938 also saw another major event in the history of microfilm when University Microfilms International (UMI) was established by Eugene Power. For the next half century, UMI would dominate the field, filming and distributing microfilm editions of current and past publications and academic dissertations. After another short-lived name change, UMI was made a part of ProQuest Information and Learning in 2001. Uses DuKane brand microfiche reader with source code printed on the films. Systems that mount microfilm images in punched cards have been widely used for archival storage of engineering information. For example, when airlines demand archival engineering drawings to support purchased equipment (in case the vendor goes out of business, for example), they normally specify punch-card-mounted microfilm with an industry-standard indexing system punched into the card. This permits automated reproduction, as well as permitting mechanical card- sorting equipment to sort and select microfilm drawings. Aperture card mounted microfilm is roughly 3% of the size and space of conventional paper or vellum engineering drawings. Some military contracts around 1980 began to specify digital storage of engineering and maintenance data because the expenses were even lower than microfilm, but these programs are now finding it difficult to purchase new readers for the old formats. Microfilm first saw military use during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71. During the Siege of Paris, the only way for the provincial government in Tours to communicate with Paris was by pigeon post. As the pigeons could not carry paper dispatches, the Tours government turned to microfilm. Using a microphotography unit evacuated from Paris before the siege, clerks in Tours photographed paper dispatches and compressed them to microfilm, which were carried by homing pigeons into Paris and projected by magic lantern while clerks copied the dispatches onto paper. Additionally, the US Victory Mail, and the British \\"Airgraph\\" system it was based on, were used for delivering mail between those at home and troops serving overseas during World War II. The systems worked by photographing large amounts of censored mail reduced to thumb-nail size onto reels of microfilm, which weighed much less than the originals would have. The film reels were shipped by priority air freight to and from the home fronts, sent to their prescribed destinations for enlarging at receiving stations near the recipients, and printed out on lightweight photo paper. These facsimiles of the letter-sheets were reproduced about one-quarter the original size and the miniature mails were then delivered to the addressee. Use of these microfilm systems saved significant volumes of cargo capacity needed for war supplies. An additional benefit was that the small, lightweight reels of microfilm were almost always transported by air, and as such were delivered much more quickly than any surface mail service could have managed. Libraries began using microfilm in the mid-20th century as a preservation strategy for deteriorating newspaper collections. Books and newspapers that were deemed in danger of decay could be preserved on film and thus access and use could be increased. Microfilming was also a space-saving measure. In his 1945 book, The Scholar and the Future of the Research Library, Fremont Rider calculated that research libraries were doubling in space every sixteen years. His suggested solution was microfilming, specifically with his invention, the microcard. Once items were put onto film, they could be removed from circulation and additional shelf space would be made available for rapidly expanding collections. The microcard was superseded by microfiche. By the 1960s, microfilming had become standard policy. in 1948, the Australian Joint Copying Project started; the intention to film records and archives from the United Kingdom relating to Australia and the Pacific. Over 10,000 reels were produced, making it one of the largest projects of its kind.'Dead Reckoning', compiled by Steve Howell and published by the Library Board of Western Australia Around the same time, Licensed Betting Offices in the UK began using microphotography as a means of keeping compact records of bets taken. Betting shop customers would sometimes attempt to amend their betting slip receipt to attempt fraud, and so the microphotography camera (which also generally contained its own independent time-piece) found use as a definitive means of recording the exact details of each and every bet taken. The use of microphotography has now largely been replaced by digital 'bet capture' systems, which also allow a computer to settle the returns for each bet once the details of the wager have been 'translated' into the system by an employee. The added efficiency of this digital system has ensured that there are now very few, if indeed any, betting offices continuing to use microfilm cameras in the UK. Visa and National City use microfilm (roll microfilm and fiche) to store financial, personal, and legal records. Source code for computer programs was printed to microfiche during the 1970s and distributed to customers in this form. Additionally, microfiche was used to write out long casework for some proofs such as the four color theorem. Advantages The medium has numerous advantages: * It enables libraries to greatly expand access to collections without putting rare, fragile, or valuable items at risk of theft or damage. * It is compact, with far smaller storage costs than paper documents. Normally 98 document size pages fit on one fiche, reducing to about 0.25% original material. When compared to filing paper, microforms can reduce space storage requirements by up to 95%. * It is cheaper to distribute than paper copy. Most microfiche services get a bulk discount on reproduction rights, and have lower reproduction and carriage costs than a comparable amount of printed paper. * It is a stable archival form when properly processed and stored. Preservation standard microfilms use the silver halide process, creating silver images in hard gelatin emulsion on a polyester base. With appropriate storage conditions, this film has a life expectancy of 500 years. However, in tropical climates with high humidity, fungus eats the gelatin used to bind the silver halide. Thus, diazo-based systems with lower archival lives (20 years) which have polyester or epoxy surfaces are used. * Since it is analog (an actual image of the original data), it is easy to view. Unlike digital media, the format requires no software to decode the data stored thereon. It is instantly comprehensible to persons literate in the written language; the only equipment that is needed is a simple magnifying glass. This eliminates the problem of software obsolescence. * It is virtually impossible to mutilate. Users cannot tear pages from or deface microforms. * It has low intrinsic value and does not attract thieves. Few heavily used microform collections suffer major losses due to theft. * Prints from microfilm are accepted in legal proceedings as substitutes for original documents. Disadvantages * The principal disadvantage of microforms is that the image is (usually) too small to read with the naked eye and requires analog or digital magnification to be read. * Reader machines used to view microform are often difficult to use; microfiche is very time consuming and microfilm requires users to carefully wind and rewind until they have arrived at the point where the data they are looking for is stored. * Photographic illustrations reproduce poorly in microform format, with loss of clarity and halftones. The latest electronic digital viewer/scanners can scan in gray shade, which greatly increases the quality of photographs, but the inherent bi-tonal nature of microfilm limits its ability to convey much subtlety of tone. * Reader-printers are not always available, limiting the user's ability to make copies for their own purposes. Conventional photocopy machines cannot be used. * Color microform is extremely expensive, thus discouraging most libraries supplying color films. Color photographic dyes also tend to degrade over the long term. This results in the loss of information, as color materials are usually photographed using black and white film. The lack of quality and color images in microfilm, when libraries were discarding paper originals, was a major impetus to Bill Blackbeard and other comic historians' work to rescue and maintain original paper archives of color pages from the history of newspaper comics. Many non- comics color images were not targeted by these efforts and were lost. * When stored in the highest-density drawers, it is easy to misfile a fiche, which is thereafter unavailable. As a result, some libraries store microfiche in a restricted area and retrieve it on demand. Some fiche services use lower- density drawers with labeled pockets for each card. * Like all analog media formats, microfiche is lacking in features enjoyed by users of digital media. Analog copies degrade with each generation, while some digital copies have much higher copying fidelity. Digital data can also be indexed and searched easily. * Reading microfilms on a machine for some time may cause headache and/or eyestrain. Readers and printers A modern day digital microfilm scanner. Automatically retrieve digital files from microfilm with the ViewScan 4 by ST Imaging. A microfiche reader in a library Desktop readers are boxes with a translucent screen at the front on to which is projected an image from a microform. They have suitable fittings for whatever microform is in use. They may offer a choice of magnifications. They usually have motors to advance and rewind film. When coding blips are recorded on the film a reader is used that can read the blips to find any required image. Portable readers are plastic devices that fold for carrying; when open they project an image from microfiche on to a reflective screen. For example, with M. de Saint Rat, Atherton Seidell developed a simple, inexpensive ($2.00 in 1950), monocular microfilm viewing device, known as the \\"Seidell viewer\\", that was sold during the 1940s and 1950s. A microfilm printer contains a xerographic copying process, like a photocopier. The image to be printed is projected with synchronised movement on to the drum. These devices offer either small image preview for the operator or full size image preview, when it is called a reader printer. Microform printers can accept positive or negative films and positive or negative images on paper. New machines by microfilm scanner manufacturer's like ST Imaging allow the user to scan a microform image and save it as a digital file: see the section below on digital conversion. Media Microfilm roll Aperture card with hollerith info A duped jacket fiche = Flat film = 105 x 148 mm flat film is used for micro images of very large engineering drawings. These may carry a title photographed or written along one edge. Typical reduction is about 20, representing a drawing that is 2.00 x 2.80 metres, that is 79 x 110 in. These films are stored as microfiche. = Microfilm = 16 mm or 35 mm film to motion picture standard is used, usually unperforated. Roll microfilm is stored on open reels or put into cassettes. The standard lengths for using roll film is 30.48 m (100 ft) for 35mm rolls, and 100 ft, 130 ft and 215 feet for 16mm rolls. One roll of 35 mm film may carry 600 images of large engineering drawings or 800 images of broadsheet newspaper pages. 16 mm film may carry 2,400 images of letter sized images as a single stream of micro images along the film set so that lines of text are parallel to the sides of the film or 10,000 small documents, perhaps cheques or betting slips, with both sides of the originals set side by side on the film. = Aperture cards = Aperture cards are Hollerith cards into which a hole has been cut. A 35 mm microfilm chip is mounted in the hole inside of a clear plastic sleeve, or secured over the aperture by an adhesive tape. They are used for engineering drawings, for all engineering disciplines. There are libraries of these containing over 3 million cards. Aperture cards may be stored in drawers or in freestanding rotary units. = Microfiche = A Microfiche holder with microfiches A microfiche is a sheet of flat film, 105 x 148 mm in size, the same size as the international standard for paper size ISO A6. It carries a matrix of micro images. All microfiche are read with their text parallel to the long side of the fiche. Frames may be landscape or portrait in orientation. Along the top of the fiche a title may be recorded for visual identification. The most commonly used format is a portrait image of about 10 x 14 mm. Office-size papers or magazine pages require a reduction of 24 or 25 in size. Microfiche are stored in open-top envelopes which are put in drawers or boxes as file cards, or fitted into pockets in purpose-made books. = Ultrafiche = Ultrafiche (also 'ultramicrofiche') is an exceptionally compact version of a microfiche or microfilm, storing analog data at much higher densities. Ultrafiche can be created directly from computers using appropriate peripherals. They are typically used for storing data gathered from extremely data-intensive operations such as remote sensing. Image creation To create microform media, a planetary camera is mounted with the vertical axis above a copy that is stationary during exposure. High volume output is possible with a rotary camera which moves the copy smoothly through the camera to expose film which moves with the reduced image. Alternatively, it may be produced by computers, i.e. COM (computer output microfilm). =Film= Normally microfilming uses high resolution panchromatic monochrome stock. Positive color film giving good reproduction and high resolution can also be used. Roll film is provided 16, 35 and 105 mm wide in lengths of 30 metres (100 ft) and longer, and is usually unperforated. Roll film is developed, fixed and washed by continuous processors. Sheet film is supplied in ISO A6 size. This is either processed by hand or using a dental X-ray processor. Camera film is supplied ready mounted in aperture cards. Aperture cards are developed, fixed and washed immediately after exposure by equipment fitted to the camera. Early cut sheet microforms and microfilms (to the 1930s) were printed on nitrate film, which poses high risks to their holding institutions, as nitrate film is chemically unstable and a fire hazard. From the late 1930s to the 1980s, microfilms were usually printed on a cellulose acetate base, which is prone to tears, vinegar syndrome, and redox blemishes. Vinegar syndrome is the result of chemical decay and produces \\"buckling and shrinking, embrittlement, and bubbling\\". Redox blemishes are yellow, orange or red spots 15‚Äì150 micrometres in diameter created by oxidative attacks on the film, and are largely due to poor storage conditions. =Cameras= Flat film The simplest microfilm camera that is still in use is a rail mounted structure at the top of which is a bellows camera for 105 x 148 mm film. A frame or copy board holds the original drawing vertical. The camera has a horizontal axis which passes through the center of the copy. The structure may be moved horizontally on rails. In a darkroom a single film may be inserted into a dark slide or the camera may be fitted with a roll film holder which after an exposure advances the film into a box and cuts the frame off the roll for processing as a single film. Roll film For engineering drawings a freestanding open steel structure is often provided. A camera may be moved vertically on a track. Drawings are placed on a large table for filming, with centres under the lens. Fixed lights illuminate the copy. These cameras are often over high. These cameras accept roll film stock of 35 or 16 mm. For office documents a similar design may be used but bench standing. This is a smaller version of the camera described above. These are provided either with the choice of 16 or 35 mm film or accepting 16 mm film only. Non adjustable versions of the office camera are provided. These have a rigid frame or an enveloping box that holds a camera at a fixed position over a copy board. If this is to work at more than one reduction ratio there are a choice of lenses. Some cameras expose a pattern of light, referred to as blips, to digitally identify each adjacent frame. This pattern is copied whenever the film is copied for searching. Flow roll film cameras A camera is built into a box. In some versions this is for bench top use, other versions are portable. The operator maintains a stack of material to be filmed in a tray, the camera automatically takes one document after another for advancement through the machine. The camera lens sees the documents as they pass a slot. Film behind the lens advances exactly with the image. Special purpose flow cameras film both sides of documents, putting both images side by side on 16 mm film. These cameras are used to record cheques and betting slips. Microfiche camera All microfiche cameras are planetary with a step and repeat mechanism to advance the film after each exposure. The simpler versions use a dark slide loaded by the operator in a dark room; after exposure the film is individually processed, which may be by hand or using a dental X-ray processor. Cameras for high output are loaded with a roll of 105 mm film. The exposed film is developed as a roll; this is sometimes cut to individual fiche after processing or kept in roll form for duplication. Computer output microfilm Computer output microfilm card Equipment is available that accepts a data stream from a mainframe computer. This exposes film to produce images as if the stream had been sent to a line printer and the listing had been microfilmed. Because of the source one run may represent many thousands of pages. Within the equipment character images are made by a light source; this is the negative of text on paper. COM is sometimes processed normally. Other applications require that image appears as a conventional negative; the film is then reversal processed. This outputs either 16 mm film or fiche pages on a 105 mm roll. Because listing characters are a simple design, a reduction ratio of 50 gives good quality and puts about 300 pages on a microfiche. A microfilm plotter, sometimes called an aperture card plotter, accepts a stream that might be sent to a computer pen plotter. It produces corresponding frames of microfilm. These produce microfilm as 35 or 16 mm film or aperture cards. Duplication All regular microfilm copying involves contact exposure under pressure. Then the film is processed to provide a permanent image. Hand copying of a single fiche or aperture card involves exposure over a light box and then individually processing the film. Roll films are contact exposed via motor, either round a glass cylinder or through a vacuum, under a controlled light source. Processing may be in the same machine or separately. Silver halide film is a slow version of camera film with a robust top coat. It is suitable for prints or for use as an intermediate from which further prints may be produced. The result is a negative copy. Preservation standards require a master negative, a duplicate negative, and a service copy (positive). Master negatives are kept in deep storage, and duplicate negatives are used to create service copies, which are the copies available to researchers. This multi-generational structure ensures the preservation of the master negative. Diazo-sensitised film for dye coupling in ammonia gives blue or black dye positive copies. The black image film can be used for further copying. Vesicular film is sensitised with a diazo dye, which after exposure is developed by heat. Where light has come to the film remains clear, in the areas under the dark image the diazo compound is destroyed quickly, releasing millions of minute bubbles of nitrogen into the film. This produces an image that diffuses light. It produces a good black appearance in a reader, but it cannot be used for further copying. Modern microfilming standards require that a master set of films be produced and set aside for safe storage, used only to make service copies. When service copies get lost or damaged, another set can be produced from the masters, thus reducing the image degradation that results from making copies of copies. Format conversion These conversions may be applied to camera output or to release copies. Single microfiche are cut from rolls of 105 mm film. A bench top device is available that enables an operator to cut exposed frames of roll film and fit these into ready made aperture cards. Transparent jackets are made A5 size each with 6 pockets into which strips of 16 mm film may be inserted (or fewer pockets for 35 mm strips), so creating microfiche jackets or jacketed microfiche. Equipment allows an operator to insert strips from a roll of film. This is particularly useful as frames may be added to a fiche at any time. The pockets are made using a thin film so that duplicates may be made from the assembled fiche. Digital conversion FlexScan is a high- performance microfilm, microfiche, and aperture card conversion scanner designed by nextScan, the world's leading microfilm scanner manufacturer. FlexScan will scan raw high-resolution images at up to 1,000 frames per minute. End users can digitize all the documents contained on one roll of film in about 3 minutes. Another type of conversion is microform to digital. This is done using an optical scanner that projects the film onto a CCD array and captures it in a raw digital format. Until recently, since the different types of microform are dissimilar in shape and size, the scanners were usually able to handle only one type of microform at a time. Some microfilm scanners by manufacturers like nextScan and ST Imaging offer swappable modules for the different microform types, and the latest viewer/scanner can accept any microform (roll, fiche, opaque cards, fiche, or aperture cards). Software (normally on the scanner itself, but more recently in an attached PC) is then used to convert the raw capture into a standard image format for archival. The physical condition of microfilm greatly impacts the quality of the digitized copy. Microfilm with a cellulose acetate base (popular through the 1970s) is frequently subject to vinegar syndrome, redox blemishes, and tears, and even preservation standard silver halide film on a polyester base can be subject to silvering and degradation of the emulsion‚Äîall issues which affect the quality of the scanned image. Digitizing microfilm can be inexpensive when automated scanners are employed. The Utah Digital Newspapers Program has found that, with automated equipment, scanning can be performed at $0.15 per page. Recent additions to the digital scanner field have brought the cost of scanning down substantially so that when large projects are scanned (millions of pages) the price per scan can be pennies. Modern microform scanners utilize 8 bit gray shade scanning arrays and are thus able to provide quite high quality scans in a wealth of different digital formats: CCITT Group IV which is compressed black & white -bitonal, JPG or JPEG which is gray or color compression, bitmaps which are not compressed, or a number of other formats such as PDF, LZW, GIF, etc. These modern scanners are also able to scan at \\"Archival\\" resolution up to 600 dpi. For the resulting files to be useful, they must be organized in some way. This can be accomplished in a variety of different ways, dependent on the source media and the desired usage. In this regard, aperture cards with Hollerith information are probably the easiest since image data can be extracted from the card itself if the scanner supports it. Often, the digital image produced is better than the visual quality available prescan. Some types of microfilm will contain a counter next to the images; these can be referenced to an already existing database. Other microfilm reels will have a 'blip' system: small marks next to the images of varying lengths used to indicate document hierarchy (longest: root, long: branch, short: leaf). If the scanner is able to capture and process these then the image files can be arranged in the same manner. Optical character recognition (OCR) is also frequently employed to provide automated full-text searchable files. Common issues that affect the accuracy of OCR applied to scanned images of microfilm include unusual fonts, faded printing, shaded backgrounds, fragmented letters, skewed text, curved lines and bleed through on the originals. For film types with no distinguishing marks, or when OCR is impossible (handwriting, layout issues, degraded text), the data must be entered in manually, a very time-consuming process.

London in 1977. The band later released four singles and there was one bootleg live album between 1978 and 1981. Inspired by The Stooges, The Nipple Erectors incorporated elements of rockabilly and 1960s garage rock into their music. Following the release of their first single, \\"King of the Bop\\"/\\"Nervous Wreck\\", in June 1978, on Soho Records, the band renamed themselves The Nips and released the garage punk song \\"All The Time in the World\\"/\\"Private Eye\\" with Phil Rowland of Eater on drums. By May 1979, the band's line up had changed to include Gavin \\"Fritz\\" Douglas, on guitar. \\"Gabrielle\\" was released in November 1979, first on Soho Records, and then reissued on Chiswick Records. with John (\\"Grinny\\") Grinton (ex Skrewdriver) on drums. By the time of its release, Grinny had been replaced by Roger Travis Williams. Gavin Douglas' guitar playing on this record marked a change in the band's sound to a more melodic style. A live album, Only the End of the Beginning was released on Soho Records in 1980, from a recording made whilst on tour with the Purple Hearts. Two other live bootlegs have recently appeared, Live at The 101 Club and Live at the Hope and Anchor both recorded in late 1979. In 1980, The Nips recorded a demo for Polydor Records at their studio in Bond Street. It was produced by Paul Weller. There were four songs recorded for this session, including \\"Happy Song\\" \\"Nobody to Love\\", \\"Ghost Town\\" and \\"Love To Make You Cry\\". The Line up for this recording was, Shane MacGowan-vocals, Shanne Bradley-bass, Gavin Douglas-guitar and Mark Harrison (ex Bernie Torm√©)-drums. \\"Happy Song\\"/\\"Nobody to Love\\" was released as a single in October 1981, on Test Pressing Records. The Nips announced to the press that they were quitting after a last gig at London's Covent Garden Rock Garden on 10 March 1980. MacGowan and Bradley did reform the band later that year, albeit briefly. The line up included James Fearnley on guitar and Jon Moss on drums. This line up played a final gig at London's Music Machine with The Jam in December 1980. In 1981 Jon Moss joined up with Boy George to form Culture Club. During 1981, Bradley took the band in another direction away from the traditional rock band format to incorporate Greek, Cretan and Irish Roots/Folk music. The popular Irish folk and America folk song \\"Poor Paddy Works on the Railway\\" had previously formed part of their early live set with Guitarist Roger Towndrow. This line up included Macgowan and Bradley plus John Hasler (ex Madness) on standup snare drum and Scots/Irish Folk Fiddler David Rattray. Later that year Bradley decided to take a break from music. Shane Macgowan and John Hasler went on to play in Pogue Mahone, later shortened to The Pogues. In 1984 Shanne Bradley co-founded The Men They Couldn't Hang to play \\"The Alternative Country and Western Festival\\" on March 1984 at The Electric Ballroom in Camden. In 1987, Big Beat released an anthology LP named Bops, Babes, Booze and Bovver, credited to \\"Nips n Nipple Erectors\\". It collects both sides of the first three singles issued on Soho, as well as adding two outtakes: \\"So Pissed Off\\" and \\"Stavordale Rd, N5\\". The later CD edition added another two outtakes: \\"Venus in Bovver Boots\\" and \\"Fuss & Bother\\". Reformation On 6 May 2008, The Nipple Erectors reformed playing a somewhat secret gig at the 100 Club, Oxford Street, London. The line-up consisted of Shanne Bradley, Shane MacGowan, Eric \\"Le Baton\\" Baconstrip, and Fritz Douglas. Bradley's daughter Eucalypta sang backing vocals on the final number \\"Gabrielle\\".

However, he had a long-lived passion for water polo: this led him to later become one of the rare world sportsmen to compete at the highest level in two different team sports. =Water polo career= As a club player-coach, Rubini won 6 Italian national domestic league titles in water polo (1947, 1949, 1950, 1952, 1953, 1955) with Societ√† Canottieri Olona, Rari Nantes Napoli, and Rari Nantes Camogli. He also totaled 84 caps, for the senior Italian water polo national team, 42 of which were as a team captain. He won a gold medal at the 1947 European Water Polo Championship, with the senior Italian national water polo team. In the meantime, he had also assumed the role of player-coach of the Italian basketball club Olimpia Milano, in 1948; and he was called by the national teams of both sports (basketball and water polo) to play with them. Rubini chose water polo, and he won a gold medal in the sport, at the 1948 Summer Olympic Games, in London, beating the Hungary in the final. With Rubini as a full-time player, Italy could boast what was to be called the \\"Golden Settebello\\", one of the most valuable water polo teams ever, which also won a bronze medal at the 1952 Summer Olympics, and at the Turin European Championship of 1954. In both the events, Italy was behind traditional rivals of Yugoslavia and Hungary. =Basketball career= As a club basketball player-coach, Rubini won 6 Italian national domestic league titles (1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1957) with Olimpia Milano. In 1957, he devoted himself only to the team's head coach role, and he then went on to win 9 more Italian national domestic league titles with Olimpia (1958, 1959, 1960, 1962, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1972). In those years, he set an unparalleled record of 322 victories, and 28 defeats. Overall, as head coach of the Milan team, Rubini totaled 501 victories, including the FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) championship in 1966, and two (European 2nd-tier) level FIBA European Cup Winners' Cups (FIBA Saporta Cup) titles, in 1971 and 1972: these were the first European-wide victories of Italian basketball clubs. He also won the Italian Cup, in 1972. As a player, Rubini won a silver medal with the senior Italian national basketball team, at the EuroBasket 1946, held in Geneva. Later, as the delegation head of the senior Italian national basketball team, Rubini also took part in the first international victories of Italy: these include the silver medal at the 1980 Summer Olympic Games. At the EuroBasket, Italy finished first at the 1983 EuroBasket, in Nantes, finished third at the 1985 EuroBasket, in Stuttgart, and finished second at the 1991 EuroBasket, in Rome. Death Rubini was involved with his beloved sports until his death: he promoted water polo formation for young athletes, and was the Honorary President of Olimpia Milano.

She is the wife of the title character Stan Smith and the mother of Hayley and Steve. Francine is voiced by Wendy Schaal. While Francine is often seen as the voice of reason in her dysfunctional family, she also has a dark, hypocritical side. This is best displayed by how she constantly badgers her family to uphold certain moral virtues. while at the same time she participates regularly as a very popular, single member in the dynamic Langley Falls Virginia Swinger community while her husband Stan is out of the country on CIA assignment. Fictional character biography Francine is 5‚Äô8\\" tall, has a 36DD bust, rarely wears panties as seen in \\"The Adventures of Twill Ongenbone and His Boy Jabari\\" and weighs 109 lbs as shown on her driver's license in \\"Shallow Vows\\". Born to a wealthy couple from South Carolina, her birth parents Nicholas and Cassandra Dawson gave her up when she was a baby so they could be upgraded to first class on a flight in \\"Big Trouble in Little Langley\\". Daddy issues stemming from her unstable relationship with her birth father led to her losing her virginity at a young age and engaging in risky sexual behaviors to this day, such as her affinity for combining drugs and alcohol with unprotected sex with strangers as seen in season one's \\"Finances with Wolves\\" and Season 15 \\"Stan & Francine & Connie & Ted\\" . Not much is known about Francine's younger years beyond the fact that she was brought up in a Roman Catholic orphanage where she was taught that left-handed people were the Devil's minions in \\"Office Spaceman\\". Her left handedness was literally beaten out of her by the nuns, as they would regularly beat her with a side of beef and a big fish on Fridays whenever she used her left hand. At the age of 7, she was adopted by a Chinese couple, B√†ba and MƒÅma Ling, Chinese Americans making her maiden name Ling. She considers herself Chinese by how she was raised by the Lings and speaks fluent Chinese, often with her parents to disguise their conversations in front of her husband Stan if he becomes a topic of discussion. Through her adopted Chinese parents, Francine has a sister, Gwen, who Stan says enthusiastically is \\"Playboy hot!\\" whenever Gwen is brought up in conversation. Francine developed a fanatical school boy crush on her algebra teacher, Mr. Feeny. When she was found hiding in his closet by his wife, the police were called. Francine lied and said that they were in a relationship. He was sentenced to jail, where he committed suicide. Francine casually recalled a sexual encounter with a group of popular girls in the school showers to Stan in \\"1600 Candles\\". \\"One day, when I was showering after gym class, these mean pretty girls caught me and kept scrubbing me all over with soap. I mean, they didn't miss a spot! And even though we were all wet and naked and slippery, they were still able to get me on all fours, and shove my face to the floor! Can you imagine, Stan?‚Äù In college Francine stabbed her roommate to death. In \\"Family Affair\\" she nonchalantly admits to the crime and expresses surprise that no one in the family knew before. During her college years Francine also developed a well-earned reputation as the number one party girl on campus, based mostly on the campus legend as she became a very successful entrepreneur while in college, developing the web site franny.com featuring her in amateur adult photo and video shoots. In the late 80s she was a prolific groupie, sleeping with Adam Ant, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, and Dexys Midnight Runners among many, many others. It was during this time that she met Stan, who had just graduated from the CIA academy. The couple met when Francine was hitchhiking drunkenly from a Duran Duran concert and Stan pulled over to give her a lift. During the drive, while enthusiastically feeling up the semi conscious Francine, Stan unsuccessfully attempted to swerve to avoid hitting a raccoon and jarring Francine awake. To put the raccoon out of its misery, Stan shot the animal, causing Francine to become attracted to Stan for the compassion he had shown. This is the key to the plan in \\"Francine's Flashback\\" to get her memory back. Francine quickly sized Stan up as a boring, yet capable financial provider, able to offer a stable and protected life. She cut off her wild life cold turkey without Stan ever knowing about her promiscuity, and the couple married soon after. Although Francine seems to hold very liberal beliefs, she keeps them mostly to herself and apparently follows her husband's conservative values. In addition to her amateur adult media career, before meeting Stan she had a brief acting career in an episode of the television show Scarecrow and Mrs. King with George Clooney, in the episode, \\"Tears of a Clooney\\". George stole her only line in the show, ruining her acting career. Since that time she has carried an obsession bordering on insanity to kill him, or at least, make him cry. Personality Although she enjoys being a housewife, Francine occasionally yearns for more fulfillment. She was briefly a successful realtor and became a surgeon for an organized- crime syndicate made up of handicapped people. She owned a muffin kiosk at the Langley Falls mall in \\"Finances With Wolves\\". When Stan refuses to use any of his CIA bonus money to help her bankroll the store, Francine turned to an Earth Wind and Fire cover band singer for financial support. His terms were acceptable to the bored wife: much back door sex. What Francine did not know was that her financier was actually Klaus in a new body. Once she joined an ultra-chic local ladies club by faking an affair with a valet. She was saved from the murderous Lady Bugs by her neighbor Linda Memari Francine maintains a \\"Sex Garden\\" in honor of all her sexual trysts in \\"Merlot Down Dirty Shame\\". A magnificent garden stretching as far as the eye can see contains a single rose bush for each of her previous lovers. When showing the garden to Stan, it's revealed that guided tours of the garden take place, and there is rumored to be a tribe of natives that have never seen a white man living deep in the garden. While she drinks wine, and occasionally smokes cigarettes, Francine is an aficionado of marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy and Ambien, to the point she steals $50 each week from the family budget to support her habit. As seen in \\"Dr. Klaustus\\", when in need of more funds, she enters amateur night contests at seedy strip clubs as in \\"N.S.A. (No Snoops Allowed)\\". Francine is comfortable with weapons, though whether or not this is because she is married to Stan is never established. She came to realize in \\"Casino Normale\\" that she becomes sexually excited when a loaded gun is placed to her temple. She is shown to carry machetes with her in the pilot and has pulled a gun on Stan on more than one occasion. She was also able to make a weapon out of a government-issued rubber shoe Roger had to wear as part of his stint as a prison therapist. While initially portrayed as a devoted housewife and unconditionally-loving mother who tries to have her family bond with one another, Francine's morality slowly deteriorates in later seasons. She talks insultingly and heartlessly of others, including her own children, proving herself just as selfish and shallow as her husband. There are times when Francine has demonstrated that she might be mentally unstable, including her vendetta against George Clooney and her extreme empty nest syndrome. In \\"Family Affair\\" she nonchalantly admits she stabbed her college roommate to death and expresses surprise that no one in the family knew before. In \\"Max Jets\\" she is visibly excited by the idea of Charles Manson being released from jail and \\"finishing what he started\\". In \\"Live and Let Fry\\" she tells Hayley that she can't handle much, and when someone rings the doorbell she screams \\"It's too much!\\". She also becomes violent and angry seemingly at random, one point sweeping Klaus' bowl onto the floor screaming 'Humans are talking!' because he interrupted her. Similarly, in the episode \\"Stan of Arabia: Part 2,\\" Francine resorts to physical violence when challenging Stan's Arabian wife, Thundercat, for Stan's affection; saying \\"you want to dance bitch; then let's dance\\" and proceeds to fight her reasonably well. In \\"Every Which Way But Lose\\", Francine also admits that she doesn't know how to vote as it confuses her too much. She just enters a booth, waits ten seconds, then comes out and yells \\"Democracy!\\" Age Francine was originally 43, but she became 40 years old in the episode \\"Tears of a Clooney\\". The episode starts with her 39th birthday (putting her birthdate in 1961, since the episode came out in 2005), she attempts to get revenge on George Clooney for a year, and the episode ends with her 40th birthday. It's unknown whether or not the other characters aged as well, except for presumably Stan. He says in one episode that she is 2 years and ten months younger than he is. However, in \\"May the Best Stan Win\\", Francine's year of birth is listed as being in 1966, and Stan's is shown to be 1962. This episode also retcons her turning 45, as it was made in 2010, and her being born in 1966 would make her 44. In \\"Shallow Vows\\", it says Francine's birthday is 26 September 1967 on her driver's license. This also retcons her age, as the episode was made in 2009, making her 42 at the time. In the same episode, she later tells Stan she was indeed born on 26 September, making her a Libra.

A naturalized Filipino-American, he was charged with espionage and with leaking classified information to the regime of a former Filipino president. The FBI labeled Aragoncillo the first known case of espionage within the history of the White House. For over thirty-one months, from 1999 to 2001, Aragoncillo was assigned under Vice President Al Gore and then later under Vice President Dick Cheney. Hired to work for the FBI at the Army's Ft. Monmouth base in New Jersey in July 2004, Aragoncillo began sending classified documents in January 2005, according to a federal complaint. On October 5, 2005, Aragoncillo was indicted and arrested in New Jersey for espionage. Federal agents accused him of stealing classified information, including details about the current President of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and then passing that information onto opposition leaders in the Philippines. According to reports compiled by Filipino intelligence professionals, there were indications of a link between Aragoncillo and the French intelligence service, Direction g√©n√©rale de la s√©curit√© ext√©rieure. Frequent visits by Aragoncillo to Manila allegedly were interspersed with clandestine meetings between identified, French operatives and several \\"illegals\\" (i.e. unregistered agents) around 2002 to 2004.

The magazine began as a website in 1998. It ran as a print publication from 2002 to 2010 before converting to online-only. History The magazine was founded as a quarterly in July 2002 and was owned by Josh Jackson, Nick Purdy, and Tim Regan-Porter. It later switched to a bimonthly format. In 2005, Paste fulfilled remaining subscriptions for the competing magazine Tracks, which had ceased publishing its print edition. Paste became a monthly with its August 2006 issue. For two years in the mid-2000s, Paste had a weekly segment on CNN Headline News called \\"Paste Picks\\", wherein editors would recommend new albums and films every Tuesday. In October 2007, the magazine tried the \\"Radiohead\\" experiment, offering new and current subscribers the ability to pay what they wanted for a one-year subscription to Paste. The subscriber base increased by 28,000, but Paste president Tim Regan- Porter noted the model was not sustainable; he hoped the new subscribers would renew the following year at the current rates and the increase in web traffic would attract additional subscribers and advertisers. Amidst an economic downturn, Paste began to suffer from lagging ad revenue, as did other magazine publishers in 2008 and 2009. On May 14, 2009, Paste editors announced a plan to save the magazine, by pleading to its readers, musicians and celebrities for contributions. Cost-cutting by the magazine did not stem the losses. The main crux cited for the financial troubles was the lack of advertiser spending. In 2009, Paste launched an hour-long TV pilot for Halogen TV called Pop Goes the Culture. On August 31, 2010, Paste suspended the print magazine, but continues publication as the online PasteMagazine.com. Reemergence From 2011‚Äì2016, Paste offered a digital subscription service, covering music, movies, TV, comedy, books, video games, design, tech, food and drink. Each issue included a digital version of the Paste Sampler with seven new songs each week. In 2017, Paste launched a new, large-format print magazine with an accompanying vinyl sampler, but it was discontinued after just two issues. Content Its tagline is \\"Signs of Life in Music, Film and Culture\\". Pastes initial focus was music, covering a variety of genres with an emphasis on adult album alternative, Americana and indie rock, along with independent film and books. Each issue originally included a CD music sampler but was dropped in favor of digital downloading as a Going-Green initiative. Featured artists included Paul McCartney, Ryan Adams, Blackalicious, Regina Spektor, The Whigs, Fiona Apple, The Decemberists, Mark Heard, Woven Hand, Milton and the Devils Party, Liam Finn, The Trolleyvox, and Thom Yorke. Many of these artists also contributed to the Campaign to Save Paste. Paste added video game coverage in 2006 and has since expanded to include television, comedy, drinks (primarily craft beer), politics, travel and tech. The site streams original music performances daily from its studios in Atlanta and New York. The Paste Studio Paste has been recording live performances since 2006, first in its office in Decatur, Ga., and then in its Manhattan studio location beginning in 2016. In 2015, Paste added several collections of archival live audio and video to its website. Performances may be streamed for free at the site or on the Paste Music & Daytrotter app, launched in late 2017. In 2019, Paste opened a second studio in Downtown Atlanta. Awards In 2005, Paste was listed at #21 on the Chicago Tribunes list of \\"50 Best Magazines\\"; it appeared on the list again in 2007. Paste was also named \\"Magazine of the Year\\" by the PLUG Independent Music Awards in 2006, 2007 and 2008. In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Paste was nominated for a National Magazine Award in the category of General Excellence, and in 2010, associate editor Rachael Maddux' writings were nominated for Best Reviews.

McCabe, Sr., in his highly cited, 1976 paper better known for introducing cyclomatic complexity. McCabe defined essential complexity as the cyclomatic complexity of the reduced CFG (control flow graph) after iteratively replacing (reducing) all structured programming control structures, i.e. those having a single entry point and a single exit point (for example if-then-else and while loops) with placeholder single statements.http://www.mccabe.com/pdf/mccabe- nist235r.pdf McCabe's reduction process is intended to simulate the conceptual replacement of control structures (and actual statements they contain) with subroutine calls, hence the requirement for the control structures to have a single entry and a single exit point. (Nowadays a process like this would fall under the umbrella term of refactoring.) All structured programs evidently have an essential complexity of 1 as defined by McCabe because they can all be iteratively reduced to a single call to a top-level subroutine. As McCabe explains in his paper, his essential complexity metric was designed to provide a measure of how far off this ideal (of being completely structured) a given program was. Thus greater than 1 essential complexity numbers, which can only be obtained for non-structured programs, indicate that they are further away from the structured programming ideal. To avoid confusion between various notions of reducibility to structured programs, it's important to note that McCabe's paper briefly discusses and then operates in the context of a 1973 paper by S. Rao Kosaraju, which gave a refinement (or alternative view) of the structured program theorem. The seminal 1966 paper of B√∂hm and Jacopini showed that all programs can be [re]written using only structured programming constructs, (aka the D structures: sequence, if-then-else, and while-loop), however, in transforming a random program into a structured program additional variables may need to be introduced (and used in the tests) and some code may be duplicated. In their paper, B√∂hm and Jacopini conjectured, but did not prove that it was necessary to introduce such additional variables for certain kinds of non-structured programs in order to transform them into structured programs. An example of program (that we now know) does require such additional variables is a loop with two conditional exits inside it. In order to address the conjecture of B√∂hm and Jacopini, Kosaraju defined a more restrictive notion of program reduction than the Turing equivalence used by B√∂hm and Jacopini. Essentially, Kosaraju's notion of reduction imposes, besides the obvious requirement that the two programs must compute the same value (or not finish) given the same inputs, that the two programs must use the same primitive actions and predicates, the latter understood as expressions used in the conditionals. Because of these restrictions, Kosaraju's reduction does not allow the introduction of additional variables; assigning to these variables would create new primitive actions and testing their values would change the predicates used in the conditionals. Using this more restrictive notion of reduction, Kosaraju proved B√∂hm and Jacopini's conjecture, namely that a loop with two exits cannot be transformed into a structured program without introducing additional variables, but went further and proved that programs containing multi-level breaks (from loops) form a hierarchy, such that one can always find a program with multi-level breaks of depth n that cannot be reduced to a program of multi-level breaks with depth less than n, again without introducing additional variables.For more modern treatment of the same results see: Kozen, The B√∂hm‚ÄìJacopini Theorem is False, Propositionally McCabe notes in his paper that in view of Kosaraju's results, he intended to find a way to capture the essential properties of non- structured programs in terms of their control flow graphs. He proceeds by first identifying the control flow graphs corresponding to the smallest non- structured programs (these include branching into a loop, branching out of a loop, and their if-then-else counterparts) which he uses to formulate a theorem analogous to Kuratowski's theorem, and thereafter he introduces his notion of essential complexity in order to give a scale answer (\\"measure of the structuredness of a program\\" in his words) rather than a yes/no answer to the question of whether a program's control flow graph is structured or not. Finally, the notion of reduction used by McCabe to shrink the CFG is not the same as Kosaraju's notion of reducing flowcharts. The reduction defined on the CFG does not know or care about the program's inputs, it is simply a graph transformation.McCabe footnotes the two definitions of on pages 315 and 317. For example, the following C program fragment has an essential complexity of 1, because the inner if statement and the for can be reduced, i.e. it is a structured program. for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) { if (a[i]  0) b[i] += 2; } The following C program fragment has an essential complexity of four; its CFG is irreducible. The program finds the first row of z which is all zero and puts that index in i; if there is none, it puts -1 in i. for (i = 0; i < m; i++) { for (j = 0; j < n; j++) { if (z[i][j] != 0) goto non_zero; } goto found; non_zero: } i = -1; found: The idea of CFG reducibility by successive collapses of sub-graphs (ultimately to a single node for well-behaved CFGs) is also used in modern compiler optimization. However the notion from structured programming of single-entry and single-exit control structure is replaced with that of natural loop, which is defined as a \\"single-entry, multiple-exit loop, with only a single branch back to the entry from within it\\". The areas of the CFG that cannot be reduced to natural loops are called improper regions; these regions end up having a fairly simple definition: multiple-entry, strongly connected components of the CFG. The simplest improper region is thus a loop with two entry points. Multiple exits do not cause analysis problems in modern compilers. Improper regions (multiple-entries into loops) do cause additional difficulties in optimizing code.

The son of the television director John Glenister and the older brother of actor Philip Glenister, he is known for roles including con man Ash \\"Three Socks\\" Morgan in the BBC television series Hustle (2004-2012) and Nicholas Blake in the spy drama Spooks (2006-2010). Career Glenister had a regular role in the BBC sitcom Sink or Swim, which ran from 1980 until 1982. He has also appeared in shows such as Soldier Soldier, Only Fools and Horses (as Myles the millionaire garden centre owner and chairman of the SWANS committee), A Touch of Frost and Inspector George Gently, as well as several films. He had a starring role in the BBC drama Hustle as Ash Morgan, a high- level con-man who has to convincingly play various roles or characters to pull off a con and lure a 'mark'. He is the only actor who has appeared in every episode of the series. He has also had regular starring roles in the BBC drama Spooks and appeared in Spartacus. He appeared as an Irish-American mob boss in Ben Affleck's crime drama Live by Night, which was released in December 2016. He has been cast twice in Doctor Who, playing Salateen in The Caves of Androzani (1984) (opposite his Sink or Swim co-star Peter Davison) and Thomas Edison in \\"Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror\\" (2020). Personal life Glenister married actor Amanda Redman in 1984; the couple had one child together, daughter Emily, before they divorced in 1992. He later married BBC Radio producer and director Celia de Wolff, with whom he has one child, son Tom. In April 2019, it was reported that lawyers acting for a company owned by Glenister - Big Bad Wolff - had lost an appeal in a long-running battle with HM Revenue and Customs regarding liability for National Insurance contributions. Glenister subsequently said that he would have to sell or remortgage his house as a result of the ruling, since he now faced a bill of ¬£147,000 plus interest.

After leaving primary or elementary school students are enrolled in different types of secondary schools, according to their academic ability. The course is a six-year course and successful completion allows the candidate admission to Dutch universities. The VWO is therefore a matriculation exam. The VWO includes the so-called Gymnasium variant, which differs from the regular VWO variant (also called Atheneum) in that it has Latin and/or Classic Greek as an additional, compulsory part of the curriculum (some schools offer additional courses as well). A few schools offer only the Gymnasium variant, called 'Categoraal Gymnasium'. Of all VWO students, around a quarter follow gymnasium, accounting for approximately 5-6% of all Dutch high school students.  Specialization  Prior to 2001, students had to choose at least 7 out of roughly 14 (options varied by school) topics on which they would ultimately take the national examinations. Dutch and a modern foreign language most often, but not necessarily English were the two compulsory topics, with five topics open for choice, which students picked according to their ability and interest. Students in the Gymnasium substream had to take at least one classical language (Ancient Greek, Latin). For others, the most commonly chosen topics included English, French, German, physics, biology, mathematics (applied and advanced), chemistry, history and economics (macro and micro). Less common topics were Spanish, Russian, West Frisian, Italian and philosophy. Since the 2001 'Phase II' reforms of Dutch secondary education, candidates have to specialize in one or more of four 'profiles' at the start of their fourth year of study in the VWO. They contain a fixed set of topics which form a less fragmented study course to offer students a better and more holistic preparation for their university studies. An addition to the Phase II is the Technasium program, in both VWOs (Atheneums and Gymnasiums), acting as sort of a fifth profile. It was originally designed to give students a look into the world of technology oriented professions is based around O&O;, Research and Design. Students work together in groups on assignments from actual companies and contests as diverse as designing a building, proposing a product involving solar energy or even developing a plan for the gentrification of an area. For the last two years, the school no longer acts as a contact person, and students must approach companies to find an assignment. The course is finished with a \\"meesterproef\\", literally a proof of mastery in which the students spend 160 hours a person on a project. In Phase II, all students are required to participate in the following courses: Dutch, English, mathematics (there are four different courses in mathematics: A/B/C/D), Latin or Ancient Greek/an additional foreign language (Gymnasium students are not required to follow an additional foreign language other than English), PE (in Dutch: 'bewegingsonderwijs of lichamelijk onderwijs'), ANW (General Nature Sciences, only in the fourth/fifth class, depending on the school), CKV (a general form of culture and art education in the Atheneum stream) or KCV (classical cultural education in the Gymnasium stream, similar to CKV, except from the fact that it focuses on the classical aspect) and \\"Maatschappijleer\\" (only in the fourth class, similar to social sciences). The content of some subjects has also changed: economics has become a total subject, instead of variations between economics 1 or 2, similar to the fact that students no longer have to choose between French 1 or 2 and German 1 or 2 but instead take French and German as whole subjects. On top of these subjects the students have to choose a study profile. The profiles are sets of classes that prepare for future studies. Each profile has a set of fixed and optional classes that can be chosen from. The four profiles are: * Cultuur en Maatschappij (C&M;) (literally, \\"culture and society\\") emphasizes history, arts, and foreign languages (French, German and less frequently Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Hebrew and Turkish). Students following the profile are required to choose an extra foreign language and have to choose between mathematics A and C. Mathematics C is a simplified version of mathematics A, focusing on stochastics and in a lesser extent on statistics. This profile prepares for artistic and cultural training at the university. * Economie en Maatschappij (E&M;) (literally, \\"economy and society\\") emphasizes history and economics. Students following the profile are required to choose between mathematics A and B, as mathematics C do not give access to economics classes. Mathematics B focuses on algebra and geometry, and sometimes mathematics A and B share content of the taught material, albeit mathematics A is a slightly simplified version of mathematics B in these cases. This profile prepares for economics training at university. Students following the first two profiles are required to follow history and in the second profile economics is also required. There are more optional additional courses in the first two profiles than in the last two profiles. The number of optional additional courses varies per school. Additional languages are considered to be part of the first profile, while geography and philosophy can be applied to both profiles. * Natuur en Gezondheid (N&G;) (literally, \\"nature and health\\") emphasizes biology and natural sciences. This profile requires biology and chemistry classes. You can choose between mathematics A and B, but B is recommended, as Physics (optional) and Chemistry require knowledge of this. This profile is necessary to attend medical training at university. It should however be noted that to study medicine physics is a required course in the Netherlands, and a \\"natuur en gezondheid\\" profile with physics and mathematics B doubles as a \\"natuur en techniek\\" one. * Natuur en Techniek (N&T;) (literally, \\"nature and technology\\") emphasizes natural sciences. The mathematics B classes focus on algebra and geometry. This profile is necessary to attend technological and natural science training at university and to attend medical school. The latter two profiles strongly overlap, so that it is possible to technically follow both profiles depending on the student's choice of optional topics. Students following Natuur en Gezondheid can do this by choosing mathematics B and adding physics to their curriculum; students following Natuur en Techniek can do this by adding biology. The main difference between the third and fourth profile is (depending on the school) the possibility to follow economy/geography/philosophy in combination with the N&G; profile, or mathematics D/NLT (Nature, Life and Technology) with the N&T; profile. It is possible to combine courses, which is quite common. Profiles can be combined as well, for instance Natuur en Techniek with additional biology doubles as Natuur en Gezondheid. Therefore, the four profiles are often put into two groups, the M-line for the first two profiles listed and the N-line for the last two listed. Students can also choose to do an extra additional course. For instance, a student following Natuur en Techniek can attend a third foreign language if the school has sufficient facilities to do so or studies it in his spare time and participate only in the mandatory examinations. A student can choose to discontinue that subject, at all times.

Born in Cognac, Charente, he studied theology at the Coll√®ge de Navarre, and became a member of the court of Charles VIII of France. A terrible sickness led him to abandon a formerly frivolous lifestyle and he took holy orders. Charles appointed him bishop of Angoul√™me in 1494. In this capacity, he reformed the monastic rules, visited the poor, decorated churches, and composed original poems, besides translating the works of the ancients. His poetic compositions include Tout m'est dueil, tout m'est desplaisir and Plus n'ay d'actente au bien que j'esp√©roye. An outbreak of the plague forced him to abandon his post as bishop in 1502, and he died the same year.

Originally built as the Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal Railway, a Pittsburgh extension of George J. Gould's Wabash Railroad, the venture entered receivership in 1908 and the line was cut loose. An extension completed in 1931 connected it to the Western Maryland Railway at Connellsville, Pennsylvania, forming part of the Alphabet Route, a coalition of independent lines between the Northeastern United States and the Midwest. It was leased by the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1964 in conjunction with the N&W; acquiring several other sections of the former Alphabet Route, but was leased to the new spinoff Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway in 1990, just months before the N&W; was merged into the Norfolk Southern Railway. The original Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal Railway built several massive engineering works, including the Wabash Terminal in downtown Pittsburgh, damaged by two fires in 1946 and demolished in 1953. The Wabash Bridge over the Monongahela River into Pittsburgh was torn down in 1948, and on December 27, 2004, the Wabash Tunnel just southwest of the bridge opened as a high occupancy vehicle roadway through Mount Washington. As of January 2020 the two piers of the long-gone Wabash Bridge remain standing. The line also had a branch to West End, Pennsylvania, that was abandoned in 2011, and a branch to West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, known as the Mifflin Branch. And it also has a small industrial branch located near Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania. At the end of 1960 P&WV; operated of road on of track; that year it reported 439 million net ton-miles of revenue freight. History =Gould system: 1901 to 1908= Around 1900 George J. Gould was assembling railroads to create a transcontinental system. The Western Pacific Railway, Denver and Rio Grande Railroad and Missouri Pacific Railroad formed the line from the Pacific Ocean at San Francisco to the Mississippi River at St. Louis (completed in 1909). Past St. Louis, Gould acquired the Wabash Railroad to Toledo. On February 1, 1901 Gould, along with Joseph Ramsey, Jr., of the Wabash and others, formed the Pittsburgh-Toledo Syndicate, a syndicate intending to extend the system to Pittsburgh. The next month, the syndicate bought the Pittsburgh and Mansfield Railroad, an unbuilt line with a charter to build into downtown Pittsburgh. By May 1 the syndicate gained control of the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad, extending the system from Toledo southeast to Zanesville, Ohio and Wheeling, West Virginia. The extension to Pittsburgh was chartered in three parts‚Äîthe Cross Creek Railroad April 23, 1900 in Ohio, Pittsburgh, Toledo and Western Railroad April 3, 1901 in West Virginia, and Pittsburgh, Carnegie and Western Railroad July 17, 1901, in Pennsylvania. Work on the line, branching off the P&WV;'s line to Wheeling at Pittsburgh Junction, Ohio, began June 14, 1901. On May 7, 1904, the three companies were consolidated into the Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal Railway, to which all the properties of the syndicate (including the W&LE;) were transferred. The first train passed through the Wabash Tunnel and crossed the Wabash Bridge over the Monongahela River into Pittsburgh on June 1, and passenger service into the new Wabash Terminal began July 2, with through service over the W&LE; and Wabash to Toledo, Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City. In addition to the Pittsburgh extension Gould planned a line from Zanesville southeast to Belington, West Virginia, built by the Little Kanawha Syndicate. From Belington east to tidewater in Baltimore, the Fuller Syndicate bought the West Virginia Central and Pittsburg Railway and a controlling interest in the Western Maryland Railroad in 1902. Another part of the plan was the Philadelphia and Western Railway, a high-speed third rail electric interurban line, which would have run from Philadelphia west to the Western Maryland at York, Pennsylvania. The lines of the Fuller Syndicate were completed to Baltimore, but the Little Kanawha line was not completed and a connection between the main system and the Fuller Syndicate was not built. As Gould's plans affected the Pennsylvania Railroad's business, PRR took measures to fight back. This included the eviction from PRR property of telegraph poles owned by Gould's Western Union. The Panic of 1907 hit Gould hard, due to the high costs of building the line when all the easy routes had been taken, and the Western Maryland Railroad was the first of his properties to fail, entering receivership on March 5, 1908. The Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal Railway entered receivership May 29 of that year, ending through traffic between Pittsburgh and the W&LE; and Wabash system. =Independence: 1908 to 1929= After years of operation by its receivers, the company was finally sold at foreclosure in August 1916 and reorganized November as the Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railway. The line was again being considered for part of a major system‚Äîthe \\"Fifth System\\" to supplement the four major players, the Pennsylvania Railroad, New York Central Railroad, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Erie Railroad‚Äîbut there was still the issue of the gap between the W&LE;/P&WV; and the Western Maryland, never filled by the Little Kanawha Syndicate. The existing West Side Belt Railroad provided for the beginning of this extension, crossing the P&WV; at the southwest portal of the Wabash Tunnel under Mount Washington and running southeast and east to Clairton on the Monongahela River. After an initial denial, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved the P&WV;'s plan to acquire the West Side Belt in December 1928. =Pennsylvania Railroad influence: 1929 to 1964= In 1929, the Pennsylvania Railroad incorporated the Pennroad Corporation as an investment and holding company. This allowed the PRR to indirectly invest in other transportation companies without ICC regulation. Among the initial purchases, 72% of the P&WV; was acquired.Baer, Christopher T., PRR Chronology 1929Alphabet Route Pittsburgh & West Virginia Railway On February 11, 1931, the extension to Connellsville, Pennsylvania opened, where the Western Maryland continued east, splitting from the West Side Belt at Pierce. This formed what came to be known as the Alphabet Route, following roughly the same plan as Gould's system, but using the Nickel Plate Road rather than the Wabash to reach both St. Louis and Chicago. The P&WV; and Western Maryland never actually physically connected to one another in Connellsville‚Äîa short section of Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad trackage was used to connect the P&WV; to the WM. The Nickel Plate leased the Wheeling and Lake Erie on December 1, 1949. In March 1950, the Pennroad announced plans to lease the P&WV; to the Nickel Plate.Baer, Christopher T., PRR Chronology 1950 In 1962, the Norfolk & Western Railway filed to include the P&WV; in the upcoming merger of the Nickel Plate. On October 16, 1964, the Norfolk and Western acquired the Nickel Plate and leased the P&WV.; On the other hand, the Western Maryland Railway eventually went to the competing Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1967. Following the abandonment of the Western Maryland Railway mainline from Connellsville to Cumberland, Maryland, in 1975, a connection was established between the P&WV; and the B&O; at a location near Connellsville called Sodem, and the P&WV;'s connection to the P&LE; and WM was abandoned at this same time. This enabled a semblance of the old Alphabet Route to continue under the Chessie System, although on B&O; lines east from Connellsville instead of WM lines. =Norfolk and Western: 1964 to 1990= The Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railroad was organized in 1967 as a real estate investment trust to own the property leased to the N&W.; The railroad is now a subsidiary of POWER REIT, real estate investment trust that is publicly traded on the NYSE under the symbol \\"PW\\". The leased properties consist of a railroad line 112 miles in length, extending from Connellsville, Washington, and Allegheny Counties in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; Brooke County in the State of West Virginia, and Jefferson and Harrison Counties in Ohio. There are also branch lines that total 20 miles in length located in Washington County and Allegheny County in Pennsylvania and Brooke County, West Virginia. The railroad was leased in 1964 to NSC, formerly Norfolk and Western Railway Company, by the Company's predecessor for 99 years with the right of unlimited renewal for additional 99-year period under the same terms and conditions, including annual rent payments. The lease provides that NSC at its own expense and without deduction from the rent, will maintain, manage and operate the leased property and make such improvements thereto as it considers desirable. Such improvements made by NSC become the property of the Pittsburgh & West Virginia Railroad, and the cost thereof constitutes a recorded indebtedness of the Company to NSC. The Company's business consists solely of the ownership of the properties subject to the lease, and of collection of rent thereon. Upon termination of the lease, all properties covered by the lease would be returned to Pittsburgh & West Virginia Railroad, together with sufficient cash and other assets to permit operation of the railroad for one year. =Wheeling and Lake Erie: 1990 to present= On May 17, 1990, Norfolk Southern spun off most of the former W&LE; as a new Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway. The P&WV; lease was transferred to the new W&LE;, which has also acquired trackage rights over CSX Transportation lines from Connellsville east to Hagerstown, Maryland.

Note the title Heroides sive Epistolae, The Heroides or the Letters. The Heroides (The Heroines),Usually abbreviated Her. or H. in citations of Ovid's works. or Epistulae Heroidum (Letters of Heroines), is a collection of fifteen epistolary poems composed by Ovid in Latin elegiac couplets and presented as though written by a selection of aggrieved heroines of Greek and Roman mythology in address to their heroic lovers who have in some way mistreated, neglected, or abandoned them. A further set of six poems, widely known as the Double Heroides and numbered 16 to 21 in modern scholarly editions, follows these individual letters and presents three separate exchanges of paired epistles: one each from a heroic lover to his absent beloved and from the heroine in return. The Heroides were long held in low esteem by literary scholars but, like other works by Ovid, were re-evaluated more positively in the late 20th century. Arguably some of Ovid's most influential works (see below), one point that has greatly contributed to their mystique--and to the reverberations they have produced within the writings of later generations--is directly attributable to Ovid himself. In the third book of his Ars Amatoria, Ovid argues that in writing these fictional epistolary poems in the personae of famous heroines, rather than from a first-person perspective, he created an entirely new literary genre. Recommending parts of his poetic output as suitable reading material to his assumed audience of Roman women, Ovid wrote of his Heroides: \\"vel tibi composita cantetur Epistola voce:  ignotum hoc aliis ille novavit opus\\" (Ars Amatoria 3.345‚Äì6: \\"Or let an Epistle be sung out by you in practiced voice: unknown to others, he [sc. Ovid] originated this sort of composition\\"). The full extent of Ovid's originality in this matter has been a point of scholarly contention: E. J. Kenney, for instance, notes that \\"novavit is ambiguous: either 'invented' or 'renewed', cunningly obscuring without explicitly disclaiming O[vid]'s debt to Propertius' Arethusa (4.3) for the original idea.\\"Kenney (1996) 1, n. 3. In spite of various interpretations of Propertius 4.3, consensus nevertheless concedes to Ovid the lion's share of the credit in the thorough exploration of what was then a highly innovative poetic form. Dating and authenticity The exact dating of the Heroides, as with the overall chronology of the Ovidian corpus, remains a matter of debate. As Peter E. Knox notes, \\"[t]here is no consensus about the relative chronology of this [sc. early] phase of O[vid]'s career,\\" a position which has not advanced significantly since that comment was made.Knox (1995) 3. Exact dating is hindered not only by a lack of evidence, but by the fact that much of what is known at all comes from Ovid's own poetry. One passage in the second book of Ovid's Amores (Am.) has been adduced especially often in this context: Knox notes that \\"[t]his passage ... provides the only external evidence for the date of composition of the Heroides listed here. The only collection of Heroides attested by O[vid] therefore antedates at least the second edition of the Amores (c. 2 BC), and probably the first (c. 16 BC) ...\\"Knox (1995) 6. He also provides (p. 6, n. 9) a cautionary note, with references, on the use of modern terminology such as publication to refer to \\"the circumstances of ancient book production and circulation.\\" On this view, the most probable date of composition for at least the majority of the collection of single Heroides ranges between c. 25 and 16 BC, if indeed their eventual publication predated that of the assumed first edition of the Amores in that latter year.Like many other aspects of Ovidian studies, what is known about the publication of multiple editions of the Amores is derived almost solely from Ovid himself, who opens those early poems with the epigrammatic preface: We who were (not so long ago) the five little books of Naso Are now three; their author preferred his work this way over that. Though even now you may take little pleasure in reading us, With two books swept away your pain will be lighter With Ovid's word as the only viable evidence on the matter, the existence of a second edition of the Amores is widely regarded as potentially questionable (cf. the arguments of, e.g. Holzberg [1997]). Regardless of absolute dating, the evidence nonetheless suggests that the single Heroides represent some of Ovid's earliest poetic efforts. Questions of authenticity, however, have often inhibited the literary appreciation of these poems.For a fuller overview of the authenticity debate than can be offered here, see, among others, Lachmann (1876), Palmer (1898), Courtney (1965) and (1998), Anderson (1973), Reeve (1973), Jacobson (1974), Tarrant (1981), Knox (1986), (1995, esp. the introduction), and (2002), Kennedy (2002), and Lingenberg (2003). Joseph Farrell identifies three distinct issues of importance to the collection in this regard: (1) individual interpolations within single poems, (2) the authorship of entire poems by a possible Ovidian impersonator, and (3) the relation of the Double Heroides to the singles, coupled with the authenticity of that secondary collection. Discussion of these issues has been a focus, even if tangentially, of many treatments of the Heroides in recent memory. As an example following these lines, for some time scholars debated over whether this passage from the Amores--corroborating, as it does, only the existence of Her. 1‚Äì2, 4‚Äì7, 10‚Äì11, and very possibly of 12, 13,Am. 2.18.38 reads et comes extincto Laodamia viro (\\"and Laodamia, companion to her deceased husband\\"), which could refer solely to a subject of the poetry of Macer, who is addressed in Am. 2.18, or could as easily be relating Macer's works to Ovid's own compositions, serving as evidence, therefore, for the authenticity of Her. 13. and 15--could be cited fairly as evidence for the inauthenticity of at least the letters of Briseis (3), Hermione (8), Deianira (9), and Hypermnestra (14), if not also those of Medea (12), Laodamia (13), and Sappho (15).Some critics have argued that the passage in cruces in line 26--together with its partner at line 34 (det votam Phoebo Lesbis amata lyram ‚Äì \\"the woman of Lesbos, loved in return, might offer Phoebus the promised lyre\\")--is in fact an interpolation. Stephen Hinds argues, however, that this list constitutes only a poetic catalogue, in which there was no need for Ovid to have enumerated every individual epistle.Hinds (1993) 30 f., a suggestion cited by scholars since almost as a matter of reflex. Cf. also, on Her. 12, Knox (1986) and Heinze (1991‚Äì93). For a more recent discussion of the broad implications of this passage from the Amores, see Knox (2002) 118‚Äì21. This assertion has been widely persuasive, and the tendency amongst scholarly readings of the later 1990s and following has been towards careful and insightful literary explication of individual letters, either proceeding under the assumption of, or with an eye towards proving, Ovidian authorship. Other studies, eschewing direct engagement with this issue in favour of highlighting the more ingenious elements--and thereby demonstrating the high value--of individual poems in the collection, have essentially subsumed the authenticity debate, implicating it through a tacit equation of high literary quality with Ovidian authorship. This trend is visible especially in the most recent monographs on the Heroides.Cf. in particular the recent dissertations-turned-published- monographs of Lindheim (2003), Spentzou (2003), and Fulkerson (2005). On the other hand, some scholars have taken a completely different route, ascribing the whole collection to oneZwierlein (1999). or twoLingenberg (2003) regards the single letters as a coherently structured work by one author, published some years after Ovid's death at latest and believed to be authentic Ovid already by Seneca; the double letters are by a different author, but probably roughly contemporary. Ovidian imitators (the catalogue in Am. 2.18, as well as Ars am. 3.345‚Äì6 and Epistulae ex Ponto 4.16.13‚Äì14, would then be interpolations introduced to establish the imitations as authentic Ovid). The collection The paired letters of the Double Heroides are not outlined here: see the relevant section of that article for the double epistles (16‚Äì21). The single Heroides are written from the viewpoints of the following heroines (and heroes). The quotations highlighted are the opening couplets of each poem, by which each would have been identified in medieval manuscripts of the collection: *I. Penelope writes to her famed husband, Odysseus, a hero of the Trojan War, towards the end of his long absence (the subject of Homer's Odyssey).See esp. Kennedy (1984) and Hinds (1999). :{ valign=top width=\\"80px\\"Epistula I: width=\\"380px\\" This your Penelope sends to you, too-slow Ulysses; A letter in return does me no good; come yourself! } *II.

A translation, Les Vingt et Une Epistres d'Ovide, was made of this work at the end of the 15th century by the French poet Octavien de Saint-Gelais, who later became Bishop of Angoul√™me. While Saint-Gelais' translation does not do full justice to the original, it introduced many non-Latin readers to Ovid's fictional letters and inspired many of them to compose their own Heroidean-style epistles. Perhaps the most successful of these were the Quatre Epistres d'Ovide (c. 1500) by , a friend and colleague of Saint-Gelais. Later translations and creative responses to the Heroides include Jean Lemaire de Belges's Premiere Ep√Ætre de l'Amant vert (1505), Fausto Andrelini's verse epistles (1509‚Äì1511; written in the name of Anne de Bretagne), Contrepistres d'Ovide (1546), and Juan Rodr√≠guez de la C√°mara's Bursario, a partial translation of the Heroides.Yvonne LeBlanc, \\"Queen Anne in the Lonely, Tear-Soaked Bed of Penelope: Rewriting the Heroides in Sixteenth-Century France,\\" in The Late Medieval Epistle, ed. Carol Poster and Richard Utz (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1996), pp. 71‚Äì87. Classics scholar W. M. Spackman argues the Heroides influenced the development of the European novel: of Helen's reply to Paris, Spackman writes, \\"its mere 268 lines contain in embryo everything that has, since, developed into the novel of dissected motivations that is one of our glories, from La Princesse de Cl√®ves, Manon Lescaut and Les Liaisons Dangereuses to Stendhal and Proust\\".On the Decay of Humanism (Rutgers University Press, 1967), p. 96. The Loeb Classical Library presents the Heroides with Amores in Ovid I. Penguin Books first published Harold Isbell's translation in 1990. Isbell's translation uses unrhymed couplets that generally alternate between eleven and nine syllables. A translation in rhymed couplets by Daryl Hine appeared in 1991.

When hired at age 28, he was the youngest GM in Major League Baseball at the time. Early life and education Daniels was born and raised to a Jewish family in Queens, New York. He went to Hunter College High School and Cornell University, majored in Applied Economics and Management, and joined the Delta Chi Fraternity. One of his classmates was A. J. Preller. After graduating from Cornell in 1999, Daniels went into business development for Allied Domecq. In 2003, he married Robyn Daniels. The couple resides in Southlake, Texas, with their son, Lincoln, and daughters Harper and Charlotte. Baseball career =Early career= His baseball career began in 2001, when he landed an internship with the Colorado Rockies. After the baseball season concluded that year, Daniels was informed of an opening in the Rangers organization. He applied and was hired by then GM John Hart as Assistant, Baseball Operations. He was promoted to Director, Baseball Operations in October 2003. In this role, Daniels negotiated multi-year contracts for Michael Young, Hank Blalock, and Francisco Cordero. In July 2004, Grady Fuson left the organization and Daniels was promoted to assistant GM. =General manager= On October 4, 2005, Hart announced he was stepping down as GM and the Rangers replaced him with Daniels. At the age of 28 years and 41 days, Jon Daniels became the youngest GM in baseball history. 2006 season Daniels' first major deal as general manager was trading Alfonso Soriano to the Washington Nationals for Brad Wilkerson, Terrmel Sledge, and Armando Galarraga, a move that perplexed many Rangers fans in the DFW area at the time. The move had many pros and cons. Soriano hit 46 homers and went on to steal 41 bases the next season and Wilkerson played most of the season injured and ended with a .222 batting average. On the other hand, trading Soriano opened up a spot for rookie Ian Kinsler and freed up money that would have been spent on Soriano's salary to be more flexible in offering Kevin Millwood a large contract. A trade made in December of 2005, sent pitcher Chris Young, outfielder Sledge and first baseman Adri√°n Gonz√°lez to the San Diego Padres for pitchers Adam Eaton and Akinori Otsuka, and catcher Billy Killian. While Otsuka filled a valuable role as the Rangers closer, the oft-injured Eaton only pitched 65 innings with an ERA of 5.12. Dallas-native Chris Young pitched 180 innings for the Padres, racking up 164 K's and posting an ERA of 3.46. Adri√°n Gonz√°lez (considered a prized prospect) batted .304 for the Padres while hitting 24 home runs. This is generally considered the worst move of Daniels' career. Some of Daniels' other moves have been better received. On the eve of the 2006 season, after losing #2 starter Eaton to injury, Daniels made a three-way deal, sending Juan Dominguez to the Oakland Athletics for John Rheinecker and Freddie Bynum, the latter of which he turned and traded to the Chicago Cubs for John Koronka. Koronka and Rheinecker helped shore up the Rangers rotation in April and May, while Dominguez stayed at Oakland's AAA affiliate for the entire year. Another trade Daniels made was sending Laynce Nix, Kevin Mench, and Francisco Cordero to the Milwaukee Brewers for minor leaguer Nelson Cruz, and All-star left fielder Carlos Lee. The trade was completed just before the trade deadline of the 2006 season. Lee was the most sought after trade target during the season and provided the Rangers with a strong bat in the middle of the lineup. Lee then signed a $100 million free agent contract with the Houston Astros, giving the Rangers the #17 and #35 draft picks in 2007 (Blake Beavan and Julio Borbon, respectively) as compensation. Cruz emerged as a power-hitting All-Star in the 2009 season for the Rangers, and became a mainstay in the lineup during the World Series years. 2007 season In late December 2006, Daniels collaborated with White Sox general manager Kenny Williams, engineering a trade that caught many within baseball's inner circles off guard. The Rangers acquired young starter Brandon McCarthy in exchange for the even younger John Danks. The Rangers committed fully to a rebuilding program during 2007, one that would directly lead to the team's unparalleled playoff success several years later. On July 31, 2007, Daniels made two career-defining trades, one with the Atlanta Braves, the other with Boston Red Sox. Daniels first agreed with Atlanta Braves General Manager John Schuerholz to trade coveted slugger Mark Teixeira and relief pitcher Ron Mahay for catching prospect Jarrod Saltalamacchia. The Rangers were also able to obtain four minor leaguers in the trade. The first of these prospects, left-hander Matt Harrison, emerged as a starter in the 2009 Ranger rotation. The second of these prospects acquired from the Braves, Elvis Andrus, was widely hailed as an elite young shortstop. Another, Neftal√≠ Feliz, a well regarded power pitcher, joined the Rangers bullpen in 2009. Both Andrus and Feliz were named as All-Stars in 2010, a season in which Feliz was voted rookie of the year. But there was another substantive trade that day, which occurred just before the trade deadline, Daniels agreed to send closer √âric Gagn√© to the Boston Red Sox for young starting pitcher Kason Gabbard, Triple-A prospect David Murphy, and rookie-league outfielder Engel Beltre. Not receiving as much attention at the time, Daniels also made a third trade prior to the deadline sending center fielder Kenny Lofton to the Indians for catching prospect Max Ram√≠rez. As a result of the 2007 draft, trades and Latin America free agent signings, the Rangers jumped to the #4 system in Baseball America 2008 organization rankings. This represented the biggest jump since Baseball America began ranking MLB farm systems. 2008 season Before the 2008 Season, Daniels traded the 2nd member of what was once dubbed the \\"DVD trio\\", sending Edinson V√≥lquez to the Reds for outfielder Josh Hamilton. This trade has received positive reviews for both sides, as each player made an All-star appearance with their new team and both teams made the playoffs in the 2010 season. Hamilton emerged as one of the biggest stars in the game, winning the 2010 AL MVP, and establishing himself as an elite offensive performer. Baseball America recognized the Rangers as having the best farm system following the 2008 season. Notable additions to the system in 2008 included draft picks Justin Smoak, Robbie Ross, and Joe Wieland. 2010 season At the 2009 Winter Meetings, many media analysts expected the Rangers to be wallflowers, as the team was up for sale, leaving Daniels with minimal budget. In order to free up salary, Daniels orchestrated a deal with the Baltimore Orioles, dealing veteran starting pitcher Kevin Millwood for young reliever Chris Ray and left-handed pitcher Ben Snyder. With the salary freed up by the departure of Millwood, the Rangers signed free agent Rich Harden. The initial fan and media reaction to the deal were mostly positive, even though both Ray and Harden were recovering from arm injuries. Daniels also signed free agents Vladimir Guerrero and Colby Lewis. On July 1, Daniels acquired catcher Bengie Molina from the San Francisco Giants for relief pitcher Chris Ray and prospect Michael Main. On July 9, Daniels acquired pitchers Cliff Lee and Mark Lowe from the Seattle Mariners for Blake Beavan, Matt Lawson, Josh Lueke, and prized prospect Justin Smoak. On July 29, Daniels acquired Jorge Cant√∫ from the Florida Marlins for prospects Evan Reed and Omar Poveda. On July 30, Daniels acquired Cristian Guzm√°n from the Washington Nationals for prospects Ryan Tatusko and Tanner Roark. On July 31, after high expectations and several disappointments, Daniels traded away the Texas Rangers 2010 opening day starting catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia to the Boston Red Sox for prospects Chris McGuiness, Roman Mendez, a player to be named later, and cash considerations equaling near $350,000. On October 22, Daniels and the Texas Rangers won the American League pennant when they eliminated the New York Yankees from the ALCS in 6 games. On December 8, Daniels was named the Baseball America Major League Executive of the Year. 2013 season On March 1, 2013 Jon Daniels was promoted by the Texas Rangers to be President of Baseball Operations and General Manager. 2014 season Nolan Ryan resigned as CEO of the Rangers and sold his stake in the team in October 2013. Since then, Daniels has been the operating head of the franchise. Co-chairmen and principal owners Ray Davis and Bob Simpson have largely left the Rangers' day-to-day operations in Daniels' hands. On November 20, 2013, Daniels kicked off a sub-par Rangers offseason by trading Ian Kinsler to the Detroit Tigers for Prince Fielder and cash. The move occurred before the winter meetings with many considering the Rangers to be active as they continue to pursue their first World Series championship. Ryan stated that he probably should have asked former Rangers owner Tom Hicks to help facilitate his relationship with Jon Daniels, when Ryan joined the organization in 2008 as club president. Daniels agreed to a three-year extension with the Rangers on November 14, 2014. The 2014 season was disastrous the Rangers hit with many injuries to top players finished last in the entire American League 67-95 (and 3rd worst in all of MLB). 2015 season After a disastrous 2014 season in which the Rangers finished last in the entire American League (and 3rd worst in all of MLB), and despite starting the season with an 8-16 record and being under .500 as late as August 3, the Rangers would clinch the American League West title on the final day of the season, the team's 6th division title and 7th postseason appearance in franchise history. The Rangers would start the season as poorly as their 2014 season ended, reaching a season low eight games under .500 (8-16) on May 3. The lone bright spot was the resurgence of Prince Fielder from season-ending surgery the prior year. At the All-Star break the Rangers improved slightly, but were still under .500 (42-46). The second half of the season would see the team begin a resurgence, led in part by the acquisition of Cole Hamels from Philadelphia, the emergence of Shawn Tolleson as the team's closer after the team released Neftal√≠ Feliz, the returns of Martin Perez and Derek Holland from the disabled list, and vastly improved play by Shin-Soo Choo and Adri√°n Beltr√©. However, as late as August 3 the Rangers were still below .500. The improved play continued, and on September 15 (during a four-game home series against their in-state and division rivals the Houston Astros) the Rangers would defeat the Astros 6-5, taking the division lead in the process and ultimately sweeping the series with the Astros. The Rangers would not relinquish the division lead from that point forward, though they would not clinch the division until the last day of the season when they defeated the Los Angeles Angels 9-2. The Rangers lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in five games in the Division Series. 2016 season The Rangers won the AL West championship for the second straight season and faced the Toronto Blue Jays in the Division Series. For the first time in franchise history, the Rangers finished with the American League's best record; thus giving them (potentially) home field advantage throughout the entire American League playoffs (and, with the American League's win in the 2016 All-Star Game, possible home field advantage throughout the entire World Series as well).

It was originally written for Townshend's abandoned Lifehouse project, with lyrics celebrating the joy of having a mobile home and being able to travel the open road. The Who's lead singer Roger Daltrey did not take part in the recording of the song, leaving the rest of the band to record it as a power trio; Townshend handles the lead vocals, guitars, and synthesizers, with John Entwistle on bass guitar and Keith Moon on drums. The song has attracted mixed reviews from music critics. Lyrics and music \\"Going Mobile\\" is one of the lighter moments on Who's Next. It was originally conceived as part of Townshend's abandoned Lifehouse project. Townshend described the use of the song in the proposed project as follows: \\"As the story unfolded, because of the vagaries of the modern world, because of pollution being caused mainly by people's need to travel, to be somewhere else. (People) had been told, 'You can't do that anymore. You have to stay where you are.' But people have got this lust for life, and adventure, and a bit of color.\\" It celebrates the joys of having a mobile home and being able to travel the highways at will ‚Äì Townshend himself had acquired a mobile home about a year before the song was recorded. An example of the theme is illustrated by such lyrics as: \\"Going Mobile\\" was recorded without Who lead singer Roger Daltrey. Rather, guitarist and songwriter Townshend handled the vocals on the song. Instrumentation includes acoustic guitar, bass guitar and drums. A VCS 3 synthesizer is also overdubbed on part of the song. Further, on his guitar solo, Townshend plays the instrument through an envelope follower, a feature of the ARP synthesizer that produces what Townshend describes as a \\"fuzzy wah-wah sound\\". Author Chris Charlesworth describes the effect as being as if Townshend is playing underwater. Allmusic critic Tom Maginnis describes Entwistle's bass playing on the song as \\"ultra-fluid\\" and Moon's drumming as \\"exuberant.\\" Critical reception Rolling Stone's John Mendelsohn described the song as \\"inane\\". However, in The Rolling Stone Record Guide, John Swenson described \\"Going Mobile\\" as one of \\"Townshend's most beautiful songs\\". Allmusic's Tom Maginnis states that \\"Going Mobile\\" \\"shows the tremendous energy of the band without the support of powerful guitar amplification\\". Charlesworth states that \\"Going Mobile\\" \\"lacks the grandeur\\" of some other Who's Next songs, but nonetheless considers it \\"a witty and worthy contender\\". Other appearances The Who never performed \\"Going Mobile\\" live. Townshend included a version of \\"Going Mobile\\" on his solo album The Lifehouse Chronicles. In 2011, Simon Townshend performed the song with Roger Daltrey's No Plan B band on its \\"Tommy Reborn\\" concert tour.

With his business partner, Andy Taylor, whom he met while studying at Trinity College, Cambridge, he founded the Sanctuary Records Group in 1979, which became the largest independent record label in the UK and the largest independent music management company in the world until its closure in 2007. Prior to managing Iron Maiden, Smallwood managed Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel. Biography Smallwood was born and raised in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, where he grew up listening to The Beatles and The Rolling Stones on the radio and playing cricket and rugby union. It was only when he began attending university that his musical interests expanded and he began listening to Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Grateful Dead and The Doors. In the autumn of 1968, Smallwood began studying architecture at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he soon became involved in organising social events, such as the annual Trinity May Ball, for which he booked the \\"various acts\\". It was while undertaking these duties that he formed a friendship with fellow undergraduate and future business partner Andy Taylor. From then on, Smallwood and Taylor worked on end-of-term events together and booked various musicians, including Graham Bond, Chris Farlowe, Bridget St John, John Martyn, and, most notably, the MC5. Smallwood acquired most of these artists from a local booking agency, Horus Arts, whose boss, Barry Hawkins, gave Smallwood advice which led to his career as a booking agent. Shortly before his final exams in 1971, Smallwood dropped out of university and moved to Paris with his girlfriend, stating that \\"it just seemed like the cool thing to do\\". After three months in Paris, Smallwood undertook a job at a London booking agency, Gemini, in order to finance a trip to Morocco. Through his work with Gemini, Smallwood was offered a \\"¬£35 a week\\" job with rival agency MAM, and therefore abandoned his trip to Morocco. After 18 months with MAM, Smallwood began managing English rock act Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel. Smallwood disliked working with Harley, whom he would later describe as \\"a pain - selfish, egotistical, obsessed\\" and thus \\"completely put me off management.\\" Convinced by EMI, Harley fired Trigram, his management agency, and Smallwood undertook the management of punk rock act Gloria Mundi. In 1979, Smallwood decided to return to university to obtain a law degree, where he was given a copy of Iron Maiden's demo tape. After much deliberation, Smallwood eventually contacted Steve Harris, the band's bassist and founder member, and arranged two pub gigs for the group in west London, one at the Windsor Castle in Maida Vale and the other at The Swan in Hammersmith. Neither show went to plan: the first was cancelled after the band refused to play early, and the band had to perform the second without lead vocalist, Paul Di'Anno, who was arrested for carrying a knife 30 minutes before the gig. In spite of this, Smallwood agreed to help the group, although, following his experiences with Steve Harley, he did not initially commit to becoming their full-time manager until he arranged the band's signing to EMI and publishers Zomba at the end of the year. Eventually joined by Andy Taylor in 1982, the pair have managed the group ever since. After committing himself to managing Iron Maiden in October 1979, Smallwood decided to form his own management company, which he would name after Iron Maiden's second single, \\"Sanctuary\\". Sanctuary Records Group eventually expanded into the largest independent record label in the United Kingdom until its closure in 2007. Prior to this, in November 2006, Smallwood left Sanctuary and formed Phantom Music Management with Andy Taylor, which focuses solely on Iron Maiden. The Iron Maiden b-side \\"Sheriff of Huddersfield\\" was written by Iron Maiden about Rod Smallwood, and was released on the 1986 single \\"Wasted Years\\". It likens Smallwood to the Sheriff of Nottingham, due to his notorious stinginess with money, and refers to his frequent complaining about a (then recent) move to Los Angeles. Smallwood did not know about the song until the single was released.

For an organization, it addresses the constraints on behavior of its members as well as constraints imposed on adversaries by mechanisms such as doors, locks, keys and walls. For systems, the security policy addresses constraints on functions and flow among them, constraints on access by external systems and adversaries including programs and access to data by people. Significance If it is important to be secure, then it is important to be sure all of the security policy is enforced by mechanisms that are strong enough. There are organized methodologies and risk assessment strategies to assure completeness of security policies and assure that they are completely enforced. In complex systems, such as information systems, policies can be decomposed into sub-policies to facilitate the allocation of security mechanisms to enforce sub-policies. However, this practice has pitfalls. It is too easy to simply go directly to the sub-policies, which are essentially the rules of operation and dispense with the top level policy. That gives the false sense that the rules of operation address some overall definition of security when they do not. Because it is so difficult to think clearly with completeness about security, rules of operation stated as \\"sub-policies\\" with no \\"super-policy\\" usually turn out to be rambling rules that fail to enforce anything with completeness. Consequently, a top-level security policy is essential to any serious security scheme and sub-policies and rules of operation are meaningless without it.

It was premiered in Prague in 1883 by Franti≈°ek Ond≈ô√≠ƒçek, who also gave the Vienna and London premieres. Today it remains an important work in the violin repertoire. Instrumentation The concerto is scored for solo violin and an orchestra consisting of 2 flutes, 2 oboes 2 clarinets (in A), 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani, and strings. Movements The structure of the concerto is the classical three movements, fast‚Äìslow‚Äìfast. The first movement and the second movement are interconnected (attacca subito). History Dvo≈ô√°k was inspired to write the concerto after meeting Joseph Joachim in 1878, and composed the work with the intention of dedicating it to him. However, when he finished the concerto in 1879, Joachim became skeptical about it. Joachim was a strict classicist and objected, inter alia, to Dvo≈ô√°k's abrupt truncation of the first movement's orchestral tutti. Joachim also didn't like the fact that the recapitulation was cut short and that it led directly to the slow second movement. It is also assumed that he was upset with the persistent repetition found in the third movement. However, Joachim never said anything outright and instead claimed to be editing the solo part. He never actually performed the piece in public. The concerto was first performed in the United States on October 30, 1891, at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago.

Biography Born on February 10, 1964 in Cuba, Ojito was raised in the Santos Su√°rez neighborhood of Havana. Her parents disliked the Communist regime and always told her one day they would leave Cuba. That day came on May 10, 1980, when Ojito and her family left the island aboard a boat named Ma√±ana, as part of the Mariel boatlift, and arrived in Key West the following the day. The family settled in Miami. Ojito finished High School there, attended Miami Dade College and went on to Florida Atlantic University, graduating in 1986. In 1987, she started working for The Miami Herald, where she remained for nine years, alternating between that paper and El Nuevo Herald. She became known, primarily, for her coverage of Cuban detainees in federal penitentiaries and stories about human rights in Cuba. In 1996, she started working in the Metro desk of The New York Times, where she covered immigration, among other beats. In 1998, she returned to Cuba to cover the Pope's visit to the island. A first person story from that trip was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. She left the paper in January 2002 to write her first book and, four years later, started teaching at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, where she became known for her work on immigration.

About half of the cases are of unknown cause, with the other half attributable to a predisposing condition or medications being taken. Contrary to cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia (e.g., cold agglutinin disease and paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria) which happens in cold temperature (28‚Äì31 ¬∞C), WAIHA happens at body temperature. Causes AIHA may be: * Idiopathic, that is, without any known causeAUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA (AIHA) By J.L. Jenkins. The Regional Cancer Center. 2001 * Secondary to another disease, such as an antecedent upper respiratory tract infection, systemic lupus erythematosus or a malignancy, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) =Medications= * Several medications have been associated with the development of warm AIHA. These medications include quinidine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alpha methyldopa, and antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins (such as ceftriaxone and cefotetan), and ciprofloxacin. Pathophysiology The most common antibody isotype involved in warm antibody AIHA is IgG, though sometimes IgA is found. The IgG antibodies attach to a red blood cell, leaving their FC portion exposed with maximal reactivity at 37 ¬∞C (versus cold antibody induced hemolytic anemia whose antibodies only bind red blood cells at low body temperatures, typically 28-31 ¬∞C). The FC region is recognized and grabbed onto by FC receptors found on monocytes and macrophages in the spleen. These cells will pick off portions of the red cell membrane, almost as if they are taking a bite. The loss of membrane causes the red blood cells to become spherocytes. Spherocytes are not as flexible as normal RBCs and will be singled-out for destruction in the red pulp of the spleen as well as other portions of the reticuloendothelial system. The red blood cells trapped in the spleen cause the spleen to enlarge, leading to the splenomegaly often seen in these patients. There are two models for this: the hapten model and the autoantibody model. The hapten model proposes that certain drugs, especially penicillin and cephalosporins, will bind to certain proteins on the red cell membrane and act as haptens (small molecules that can elicit an immune response only when attached to a large carrier such as a protein; the carrier may be one that also does not elicit an immune response by itself). Antibodies are created against the protein-drug complex, leading to the destructive sequence described above. The autoantibody model proposes that, through a mechanism not yet understood, certain drugs will cause antibodies to be made against red blood cells which again leads to the same destructive sequence. It is possible for it to occur in an immunocompromised patient. Diagnosis Diagnosis is made by a positive direct Coombs test, other lab tests, and clinical examination and history. The direct Coombs test looks for antibodies attached to the surface of red blood cells. =Clinical findings= Laboratory findings include severe anemia, normal MCV (means corpuscular value) , and hyperbilirubinemia (from increased red cell destruction) that can be of the conjugated or unconjugated type. Treatment Corticosteroids and immunoglobulins are two commonly used treatments for warm antibody AIHA. Initial medical treatment consists of prednisone. If ineffective, splenectomy should be considered. If refractory to both these therapies, other options include rituximab, danazol, cyclosphosphamide, azathioprine, or ciclosporin.High-dose intravenous immune globulin may be effective in controlling hemolysis, but the benefit is short lived (1‚Äì4 weeks), and the therapy is very expensive.

Rationale The rationale is economic and administrative efficiency: While an insurer may be able to pursue a recovery from the party responsible for an accident or from its policy-holder, this is a costly administrative procedure. The knock-for- knock agreement simplifies recovery claims among insurers and, over time, attributes costs fairly among insurers. However, knock-for-knock agreements between insurers have been criticised as unfair on the party not responsible for an accident. If, for the sake of administrative ease, an insurer pays out to repair damage done to its policy-holder's own car instead of pursuing the party responsible for the accident for all relevant costs, an effective claim is recorded against that policy-holder's insurance record. In this way, knock- for-knock agreements can result in policy-holders finding unexpectedly, when they come to renew their insurance, that they face higher premiums regardless of responsibility for an accident they were involved in. Other contexts Military Claims 'Knock for knock' is also used in a specific, analogous sense, for example, the following, cited in the \\"Law at War\\", from the US Army website : : In addition to handling these routine matters, the chief of the Claims Section participated in the negotiations with the Korean government concerning the payment of foreign claims generated by troops of the Army of the Republic of Korea who were active in South Vietnam. In fact, the MACV Staff judge Advocate's office was to play a vital role in the negotiation and implementation of certain claims agreements with the Vietnamese government and the Free World allies which came to be known as \\"knock-for-knock\\" agreements. These compacts contained provisions whereby the government of one nation waived the claims against the government of the second nation for damage to government property. The agreements did not, however, waive the personal right of an individual to claim damages in the case of negligence of a member of the force of another allied nation. The arrangements nevertheless removed a potential irritant to the relationships among the Free World forces.LAW AT WAR: VIETNAM 1964-1973, Chapter 5: Claims Administration Oil and Gas Industry 'Knock for knock' is a common contractual arrangement in the oil and gas industry.2013 Construction Law International, 'Reviewing knock for knock indemnities following the Macondo well blowout' The operator of an oil and gas property requires the assistance and expertise of many kinds of contractors, including drilling companies, well service companies, facility constructors, equipment suppliers, and caterers. Generally, the operator will engage these services under a master service agreement which sets forth the essential commercial terms under which the work will be performed. One of these terms is the allocation of the risk of loss to people and property. In general, a knock-for-knock agreement means that each party working on an oil and gas worksite -- the operator and each contractor -- agrees to protect and indemnify all the other parties against injuries to that party's employees and agents, and destruction or damage to that party's property. This allocation is not based upon the fault or culpability of the party whose employee was injured or whose property was damaged. The goal is the efficient defense and payment of a claim through having a single party responsible for the loss.

Original MOTU mini- comics The Sorceress first appears in the He-Man and the Power Sword mini- comic. This version has green skin and wears cobra-themed armor that in later media is occasionally shown as belonging to Teela. In this story, the Sorceress gives He-Man his powers, consistent with later depictions. This mini-comic is the only time Sorceress appears with green skin. This version of the Sorceress was later used as the basis for the character The Goddess in the Masters of the Universe Classics toyline. In the second series of mini-comics, the Sorceress character, now called Goddess, is no longer green-skinned but still wears the cobra-themed armor. The mini-comic The Tale of Teela exposes warrior woman Teela as a Skeletor-created clone of the Sorceress/Goddess (also named Teela), thus clarifying why both characters were originally represented by one action figure. This mini-comic also establishes a biological link between both \\"Teela\\" characters, setting them up to be developed as mother and daughter in the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe TV series. Eventually, the \\"Goddess\\" name is dropped, and the falcon-themed Sorceress (with the updated name \\"Teela Na\\", in order to distinguish her from warrior woman Teela) of the TV show would appear in the later mini-comics. He-Man and The Masters of the Universe (1983) In the Filmation series, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, the Sorceress is the mistress and guardian of the Secrets of Castle Grayskull, the source of He-Man's great power. With a vast knowledge of magic and history, she is among the wisest beings on Eternia. He-Man often seeks her counsel, especially when situations are at their worst. In the Filmation series, the Sorceress demonstrates saintly qualities such as humility and appears to other characters who are in need of guidance. However, since her powers are tied to Castle Grayskull, they weaken when she leaves its walls. When she does need to travel, though, she generally assumes the form of a falcon known as Zoar. This weakness was removed from the character with the re-emergence of the Three Towers of Eternia, allowing her to travel freely in her human form. The Sorceress is also the mother of Teela, childhood friend of Prince Adam and Captain of the Royal Guard, whose aggressive temperament is a far cry from that of her soft-spoken mother. When Teela was an infant, the Sorceress gave her to Duncan (Man-At-Arms), to raise as his own, because the Sorceress felt that Castle Grayskull was too dangerous a place for her daughter to be raised. In the episode \\"Teela's Quest\\", Teela sets out to discover the truth of her mother from The Oracle of the Crystal Sea. She succeeds, but the Sorceress erases the revelation from Teela's memory for her own good, even though she desperately wishes she could tell her the truth. Other than Man-At-Arms, the only others who share the secret are He-Man, Battle Cat, and the Oracle of the Crystal Sea. It is also established in this episode that the Sorceress' daughter is destined to someday take her place as the magical guardian of Castle Grayskull. The real name of the current Sorceress is Teela-Na. Her history is revealed in the 1984 episode \\"The Origin of the Sorceress\\", in which her past nemesis Morgoth returns and attacks Eternia. While waiting for Morgoth to reappear, the Sorceress explains to He- Man how she became the guardian of Castle Grayskull. Her home, the village of Nowella, was attacked, and subsequently conquered, by Morgoth and his allies Ferros, Repta, and Rachney, servants of the Evil Horde, although they were not mentioned by that name until later on. With the aid of an old storyteller's rhyme (In barren places find ye hope/And where no water flows, no plant grows, no wind blows/Find all you need...), Teela Na sought out Castle Grayskull, which she hoped would help her find a way to defeat her captors. Just as she was about to succumb to the Eternian wastelands, the mystical fortress appeared before Teela Na's eyes, and she was invited inside by a mysterious voice. Once inside she came across an old woman named Kuduk Ungol, her predecessor as the Sorceress. Kuduk invited her to take up the mantle of Castle Grayskull's protector, which she accepts and is imbued with the powers of Castle Grayskull. Once she had taken her place as the guardian of Castle Grayskull, the Sorceress returned to Nowella and overthrew the invaders before returning to her new home inside Castle Grayskull. Kuduk Ungol was gone by this time, her fate unrevealed. She-Ra: Princess of Power (1985) In the She-Ra: Princess of Power series (a spin-off of the He-Man series about He- Man's twin sister She-Ra, who like He-Man gets her powers from Castle Grayskull), the Sorceress summons Prince Adam to find Princess Adora and give her the Sword of Protection, which looks just like He-Man's sword but has a jewel in it. Adora becomes She-Ra for the first time after the Sorceress contacts her via telepathy and tells her her destiny and reveals that she is He-Man's twin sister. Masters of the Universe (1987 film) Christina Pickles as the Sorceress in Masters of the Universe. The live action movie, Masters of the Universe, showcased Christina Pickles in the role of Sorceress. In the movie the Sorceress has been imprisoned by Skeletor, and her powers are being siphoned into him; the result leaves her aged and dying. Once Skeletor is eventually defeated, her powers and true appearance are seemingly restored. The Sorceress is clothed in long white robes, with feather-like strands of white fabric hanging from her arms as an homage to the original design, although they are only visible in the scene where she waves goodbye to the characters of Julie and Kevin. Rather than a bird-like headpiece, crystals are placed throughout the Sorceress' long, silver hair like a crown. The New Adventures of He-Man (1989-1992) In The New Adventure, the first minicomic for the new series, the Sorceress appears in her classic falcon form, and warns Prince Adam that the Galactic Guardians, tricked by Skeletor, are siphoning the Power of Grayskull. She later appears with a totally different chrome armor, evoking the futuristic feeling of the new series, saying that He-Man will not become Prince Adam again, and that He-Man now had to say the name of the Starship Eternia in order to transform. In The New Adventures of He-Man animated series, the Sorceress wears an amalgamation of her classic falcon suit and chrome armor. She often appears in He-Man's mind, giving him advice. She can also reach out into the future with her powers to assist He- Man and his allies, and has been shown to talk to Master Sebrian telepathically. In one episode, she even sends Teela into the future to offer the homesick prince of Eternia comfort. Masters of the Universe vs. The Snake Men (2002) In the 2002 series, the attire of the Sorceress was redesigned to evoke the feeling of an Egyptian goddess rather than a falcon. She is still Teela's mother, and that fact is still kept secret. The episode \\"Out of the Past\\" briefly reveals part of the Sorceress' history, and how Teela was conceived after the Sorceress married an unnamed soldier, who supposedly died in battle. Her husband is seen in heavy bandaging throughout his appearance, and his identity remains unconfirmed throughout the series. However, it is suspected to be Man-At-Arms himself, as the heavily bandaged soldier has his eyes and build. A conversation between Duncan and the Sorceress also implies that Man-At-Arms is indeed Teela's true father. When not in formal attire, the Sorceress looks strikingly like her daughter Teela, only taller. They both have red hair. If the series had continued, it was intended that in the third season, Teela would discover that the Sorceress is her mother, but would not have lost the memory as she does in the original series. The Sorceress is also shown as a capable fighter on two occasions: In the episode \\"Out of the Past\\", she saves a village from a band of marauders led by Prahvus, while in another, \\"Rise of the Snakemen Part II\\", she fights against King Hiss by unleashing a powerful magical blast against the evil Snake-Men's leader before attacking him with her staff; unfortunately, the Sorceress is bitten by the ancient villain, and she spends the remainder of the series recovering from his poison. Her body still shows the physical scars of when the poison was in her system. The comic book produced by MVC, which follows the 2002 canon, also depicted the Sorceress' fighting prowess when she defeats Evil-Lyn in direct conflict during a storyline that saw the first appearance of Hordak. Just as there were previous Sorceresses in the 1980s He- Man series, the current Sorceress is not the first. The wife of King Grayskull, known as Veena, was seemingly the original Sorceress of Castle Grayskull. She has a similar appearance to Teela Na, can also transform into a bird, and it was she who was first entrusted with the Power Sword's protection following the death of King Grayskull. Had the series continued into a third season, She-Ra would have been introduced, with the Sorceress again sending He-Man on the quest to locate his sister with the Sword of Protection. Masters of the Universe Classics (2008-2015) In the storyline of the latest Mattel toyline, Teela is the clone of the Sorceress Teela Na. She eventually takes over from her as the new Sorceress, and will one day become the wife of King He-Man and mother to their son Dare. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (2012) In this comic, the term sorceress is more equal to the priestess. The sorceress serves as an oracle of the goddess Zoar. Teela Na was the wife of Man in Arms and the mother of Teela although Teela wasn‚Äôt aware of it until Teela Na‚Äôs death. At some point, Skeletor took over Castle Grayskull and captured her. To save Prince Adam who lost his memories she creates an illusion of a falcon to which Adam calls Zoar. However, Skeletor killed her before Adam was able to return to the castle. She appeared again during ‚Äú What Lies within ‚Äú arc. During the final fight with Snake people in the circle of eternity Tella has fallen into the eternity where she met with Teela Na once more. She claimed her daughter as a new sorceress and transformed her into a snake woman. Shenreaperd as a ghost helping her daughter in the final fight with Evil-Lynn Powers and abilities The Sorceress possesses a vast array of magical and spellcasting abilities, and is considered the most powerful magic-wielder on modern Eternia. Some spells she performs on a regular basis, including transforming into the falcon Zoar. She is perhaps most noted for projecting her telepathic image to others, especially He-Man. Her telepathy is very powerful, as she can contact He-Man across great distances as well as sense the thoughts, emotions, and motives of others. According to the episode \\"Teela's Triumph\\", the Sorceress can look into both the past and the future. She frequently uses a mystic mirror within Castle Grayskull to keep watch over current events on Eternia. The Sorceress can also teleport herself and others across vast distances, and in the episode \\"The Cosmic Comet\\", she temporarily grants He-Man the ability to fly. She can disguise herself as other people, as seen in the episode \\"Lessons\\", where she takes on the appearance of an old man. Other times she exhibits telekinesis, as well as the ability to project images, create fire, and to produce magical shields. She often serves as a deus ex machina, either by teleporting characters who are in dire straits or using her powers to augment those of He- Man, thus saving the day. In the 2002 series, the powers of the Sorceress are altered slightly. The three principal differences include: * The power to fly in human form * The tendency to focus her spells through a mystic staff * When using magic, her eyes often emit a golden light Portrayal In the 1980s series, the Sorceress is voiced by Linda Gary, who also voiced Teela, Evil- Lyn, and Queen Marlena among others. In the 1987 film, Masters of the Universe, she is played by Christina Pickles. In the New Adventures she was voiced by Venus Terzo, and in the 2002 series by Nicole Oliver, who also voiced Queen Marlena.

Mechanical Engineering: Railways, Longman & Co, London is a simple design of valve gear that was widely used throughout the world for all kinds of steam engines. It is named after Robert Stephenson but was invented by his employees.  Historical background  During the 1830s the most popular valve drive for locomotives was known as gab motion in the U.K. and V-hook motion in the U.S.A.White, John H. Jr. (1968): A History of the American locomotive, its development: 1830-1880; Dover republication of 1979, , original published by the Johns Hopkins Press. The gab motion incorporated two sets of eccentrics and rods for each cylinder; one eccentric was set to give forward and the other backwards motion to the engine and one or the other could accordingly engage with a pin driving the distribution valve by means of the gabs: - vee-shaped ends to the eccentric rods supposed to catch the rocker driving the valve rod whatever its position. It was a clumsy mechanism, difficult to operate, and only gave fixed valve events. Inside Stephenson valve gear as applied to a French 0-6-0 outside cylinder mixed traffic locomotive (Midi 801) in 1867In 1841 two employees in Stephenson's locomotive works, draughtsman William Howe and pattern-maker William Williams, suggested the simple expedient of replacing the gabs with a vertical slotted link, pivoted at both ends to the tips of the eccentric rods. To change direction, the link and rod ends were bodily raised or lowered by means of a counterbalanced bell crank worked by a reach rod that connected it to the reversing lever. This not only simplified reversing but it was realised that the gear could be raised or lowered in small increments, and thus the combined motion from the ‚Äúforward‚Äù and ‚Äúback‚Äù eccentrics in differing proportions would impart shorter travel to the valve, cutting off admission steam earlier in the stroke and using a smaller amount steam expansively in the cylinder, using its own energy rather than continuing to draw from the boiler. It became the practice to start the engine or climb gradients at long cutoff, usually about 70-80% maximum of the power stroke and to shorten the cutoff as momentum was gained to benefit from the economy of expansive working and the effect of increased lead and higher compression at the end of each stroke. This process was popularly known as \\"linking up\\" or ‚Äúnotching up‚Äù, the latter because the reversing lever could be held in precise positions by means of a catch on the lever engaging notches in a quadrant; the term stuck even after the introduction of the screw reverser. A further intrinsic advantage of the Stephenson gear not found in most other types was variable lead. Depending on how the gear was laid out, it was possible to considerably reduce compression and back pressure at the end of each piston stroke when working at low speed in full gear; once again as momentum was gained and cutoff shortened, so lead was automatically advanced and compression increased, cushioning the piston at the end of each stroke and heating the remaining trapped steam in order to avoid temperature drop in the fresh charge of incoming admission steam. American locomotives universally employed inside Stephenson valve gear placed between the frames until around 1900 when it quickly gave way to outside Walschaerts motion. In Europe, Stephenson gear could be placed either outside the driving wheels and driven by either eccentrics or return cranks or else between the frames driven from the axle through eccentrics, as was mostly the case in Great Britain. Applications Abner DobleWalton J.N. (1965‚Äì74) Doble Steam Cars, Buses, Lorries, and Railcars . \\"Light Steam Power\\" Isle of Man, UK; p. 196. considered Stephenson valve gear: \\"(...) the most universally suitable valve gear of all, for it can be worked out for a long engine structure or a short one. It can be a very simple valve gear and still be very accurate, but its great advantage is that its accuracy is self-contained, for the exact relationship between its points of support (eccentrics on shaft, valve crosshead, and link hanger arm) have but little effect on the motion of the valve. Its use on engines in which all the cylinders lie in one plane, represents, in the belief of the writer, the best choice.\\" Another benefit of the Stephenson gear, intrinsic to the system, is variable lead: usually zero in full gear and increasing as cutoff is shortened. One consequent disadvantage of the Stephenson gear is that it has a tendency to over-compression at the end of the stroke when very short cut-offs are used, and therefore the minimum cut-off cannot be as low as on a locomotive with Walschaerts gear. Longer eccentric rods and a shorter link reduce this effect. Stephenson valve gear is a convenient arrangement for any engine that needs to reverse and was widely applied to railway locomotives, traction engines, steam car engines and to stationary engines that needed to reverse, such as rolling-mill engines. It was used on the overwhelming majority of marine engines. The Great Western Railway used Stephenson gear on most of its locomotives, although the later four-cylinder engines used inside Walschaerts gear. Details of the gear differ principally in the arrangement of the expansion link. In early locomotive practice, the eccentric rod ends were pivoted at the ends of the link while, in marine engines, the eccentric rod pivots were set behind the link slot (or below on a vertical engine). These became known respectively as the 'locomotive link' and the 'launch link'. The launch link superseded the locomotive type as it allows more direct linear drive to the piston rod in full gear and permits a longer valve travel within a given space by reducing the size of eccentric required for a given travel. Launch-type links were pretty well universal for American locomotives right from the 1850s but, in Europe, although occurring as early as 1846, they did not become widespread until around 1900. Larger marine engines generally used the bulkier and more expensive marine double-bar link, which has greater wearing surfaces and which improved valve events by minimising geometric compromises inherent in the launch link. In the United Kingdom, locomotives having Stephenson valve gear normally had this mounted in between the locomotive frames. In 1947, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway built a series of their Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 locomotives, most of which had the Walschaerts' valve gear that was normal for this class, but one of them, no. 4767, had Stephenson valve gear mounted outside the wheels and frames. Instead of eccentrics, double return cranks were used to drive the eccentric rods, and a launch-type expansion link was used. This one cost ¬£13,278, which was about ¬£600 more than those built at the same time with Walschaerts' valve gear. The aim of the experiment was to find out if a valve gear having variable lead (as opposed to the constant lead of the Walschaerts' motion) would affect performance. On trial, it proved to have no advantage, although in normal service it did gain a reputation as a good performer on banks. Derivatives As a harmonic valve gear, the Stephenson arrangement may be considered as optimum. Nevertheless, the fact the link needed to be bodily displaced in order to reverse meant that it required considerable vertical clearance. At the time of its introduction, it was deemed important in the locomotive world to keep the centre of gravity, and therefore the boiler centre line as low as possible. Because valve gears in Britain were generally placed between the frames beneath the boiler, the extremely cramped conditions made the valve gear inaccessible for servicing. Also reversing could be a strenuous occupation as it entailed lifting the weight of the link plus eccentric rod ends. In order to address these problems two main variants were developed: =Gooch valve gear= Gooch outside valve gear as applied to a French 2-4-0 outside cylinder express locomotive (Midi no. 51) in 1878 In the Gooch valve gear (invented by Daniel Gooch in 1843) the reversing and cut-off functions were achieved by raising or lowering a radius rod which connected the valve- rod to a \\"stationary\\" link pivoting around a fixed point. The advantages sought were reduced height for the gear and lighter action as the reversing lever was only required to lift the weight of the radius rod. This meant that the link was convex (in relation to the eccentrics) instead of concave. Gooch valve gear had the disadvantage of angularity between the valve spindle and the eccentric rod in full gear, whereas the best forms of the Stephenson gear, the thrust was in a straight line. The Gooch gear gave constant lead at whatever cutoff. This was observed to be a disadvantage when similar locomotives fitted with either Gooch or Stephenson gear were compared in serviceHolcroft, Harold (1957). An outline of Great Western locomotive practice, 1837-1947; Locomotive Publishing Co Ltd, London, U.K. p.20. Gooch gear was never popular in Britain except with one or two engineers down to the 1860s, but it was quite common in France. =Allan straight link valve gear= The Allan straight link valve gear (invented by Alexander Allan in 1855) combined the features of the Stephenson and Gooch gears. The reversing and cut-off functions were achieved by simultaneously raising the radius rod and lowering the link or vice versa. As with the Gooch gear, this saved space but the Allan gear gave performance closer to that of the Stephenson. Moreover, the straight expansion link simplified manufacture. Once again, the Allan gear was not often used in the UK but fairly common on the Continent. Notable UK examples are the Great Western Railway's 1361 and 1366 classes, and the narrow-gauge Ffestiniog Railway's 0-4-0TT class (which were produced by George England and Co.) and the narrow-gauge Talyllyn Railway's original locomotives, Talyllyn and Dolgoch (which were produced by Fletcher, Jennings & Co.).

The game is the first in which Mario and Final Fantasy characters appear together as playable characters, and the second Mario game developed by Square Enix, the first one being Super Mario RPG. It is the first Mario basketball game ever to be released, although characters from the series have appeared in the Nintendo GameCube version of NBA Street V3. The game was released on the European Wii U Virtual Console on May 26, 2016 and it was released on North American Wii U Virtual Console on November 3, 2016. The game features a series of three versus three basketball tournaments on different courts, each of three games. The game uses the Nintendo DS's touch screen extensively, and features items and coins from the Mario series. Critics praised the game for being amusing and fun, but criticized the weak AI and limited multiplayer options, with full basketball games only being playable across two players locally who each had a copy of the game. Gameplay The gameplay of Mario Hoops 3-on-3 is centered on basketball games, structured into tournaments that the player must win in order to progress. The tournament ladder is made with graphics based on the original Super Mario Bros.. Each tournament consists of three games with two halves of two and a half minutes each. The one exception is an extra game with the Final Fantasy team at the end of the final tournament. The player can win a tournament by winning the three games on its ladder. Upon winning, the player is awarded either a gold cup, a silver cup or a bronze cup. These cups correspond with winning by more than 200 points cumulatively across the three matches, 100 points, or simply winning all three games. The matches feature three players on each side, with characters drawn primarily from Mario and other Nintendo games, as well as characters from Square Enix's Final Fantasy series. During matches, the Nintendo DS touch control is used for all actions except for movement, which can be handled by the directional pad. The player can also control direction via the touch screen. The top screen of the DS shows the game in 3D, while the bottom screen shows an overhead view of the whole court. Dribbling is performed automatically, but slower if the touch screen is not used actively to dribble. The player can perform multiple moves, such as stealing the ball and passing, by using gestures on the touch pad. The player shoots by drawing a line forward on the touchscreen. Depending on where the character is and how he/she is moving, the shot will either be a normal shot, a special shot or a slam dunk; these shots give the team different numbers of points. The basketball court contains multiple coin pads, which give the player coins when dribbled on up to a maximum value; when the player makes a shot, their coins are added to their total point score. There are also items which appear on the court; when used they grant the player special moves. There are two game modes: normal and hard. Hard mode is unlocked after the game is beaten on normal. In addition to the regular tournament game, there is an exhibition mode. In this mode, the player can customize the rules such as the amount of playing time, the number of periods played, and turning items on or off. Multiplayer is limited to local games, and each player must own their own copy of the game. The game does not have online multiplayer, and the \\"gamesharing\\" option (playing multiplayer across only one copy of the game) only allows for the playing of select minigames, not full basketball games. Music The game's music was composed and arranged primarily by Masayoshi Soken, with some tracks created by Koji Kondo and Yukio Kaneoka. The soundtrack was Soken's first major game soundtrack; he had worked at Square Enix as a sound editor for five years prior to the release of the game and had only composed music for advertisements and minor games prior to Mario Hoops. The music covers a wide variety of genres and influences, using techno, rock music, African drum beats, and vocal performances. An official soundtrack album containing music from the game, Mario Basketball 3on3 Original Soundtrack, was published by Square Enix on October 18, 2006. The album contains 31 tracks over a duration of 41:26. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. While the game was generally praised for its control, graphics, and variety, it was criticized for its simplistic AI, unsatisfactory minigames, and overpowered skills for the Final Fantasy characters. The lack of Nintendo Wi-Fi connection support also hurt the game. 411Mania gave the game a score of 7.5 out of 10 and said it was \\"a game that could've easily been rated much higher had there been Wi-Fi connectivity, smarter AI and a richer single card download-play option. Not including Wi-Fi was inexcusable as it would have easily been one of the most played games online. [...] I'd honestly recommend this game for any DS owner out there as I feel the game at least deserves a try. Some will be hooked, some won't, but you can't deny the fun of Mario Hoops 3 on 3.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald gave it three stars out of five and called it \\"fast-paced stylus-swiping basketball action best suited to short matches against friends.\\" The Times also gave it three stars out of five, saying, \\"The wild combinations of touch-pad and direction keys required to play make this a game you might not wish to use on public transport, and it somehow lacks the charm of previous Mario-themed games. Good, but not great.\\" As of July 25, 2007, Mario Hoops 3-on-3 has sold 1.5 million copies worldwide.

Bukoba was built in about 1979 and had capacity for 850 tons of cargo and 430 passengers. On 21 May 1996, Bukoba sank off Mwanza in of water, killing up to 1,000 people. The official deaths record is 894. Sinking The manifest for her final voyage showed 443 passengers in her first and second class cabins, but her cheaper third class accommodation had no manifest. Abu Ubaidah al-Banshiri, who was then second in command of al Qaeda, died in the disaster. President Benjamin Mkapa declared three days of national mourning. Criminal charges were brought against nine Tanzania Railway Corporation officials, including the captain of the Bukoba and the manager of TRC's Marine Division. Causes MV Bukoba Memorial Possible causes were identified by Captain Joseph Muguthi, formerly of the Kenya Navy, and writing in the pages of the Daily Nation as a marine navigation consultant. He labelled it an accident waiting to happen, as Lake Victoria ferries disregarded safety regulations. Specifically: #lack of life jackets, life belts, and lifeboats; #lack of fire fighting equipment; #lack of distress signals; #what equipment there is, is not regularly checked; #overload #the vessels are not regularly dry docked for routine maintenance and repairs; #the vessels are not regularly inspected; #the coxswains are not licensed to navigate. More overarchingly, Muguthi blamed the incident on governments' marine departments being staffed by civil servants and politicians who have no understanding of ships and marine decisions. The lack of equipment and divers were partially to blame for slowness in the salvage operation. Rescue teams from South Africa, including Navy divers, were flown in to salvage the ship and retrieve bodies. Replacement Replacement of the new ship is on construction at 89.7 bn/-, with the capacity of carrying around 1200 passengers, 20 vehicles and 400 tonnes of cargo.

Penguin Group (USA), Inc., and Alan S. Franken (2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18693; 31 Media L. Rep. 2254) was a civil lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on August 7, 2003. Fox News Channel, the plaintiff, sought to enjoin Al Franken from using Fox News's trademark phrase \\"fair & balanced\\" in the title of his then-forthcoming book, Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right. Judge Denny Chin denied Fox's motion for injunction on August 22, and the network dropped the suit three days later. Background Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation had founded Fox News Channel in 1996, in part to counter what it contended was systemic left-wing bias on the part of other U.S. news outlets. To bolster this perception, Fox used \\"Fair & Balanced\\" and \\"We Report. You Decide.\\" as slogans, and obtained federal trademark registrations for each.U.S. trademark registration no. 2,213,427 (FAIR & BALANCED), registered December 22, 1998, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Trademark Application and Registration Retrieval (TARR) System.

Critics such as FAIRThe Most Biased Name in News - Fox News Channel's extraordinary right-wing tilt, FAIR, July/August 2001 and Media Matters for America 33 internal FOX editorial memos reviewed by MMFA reveal FOX News Channel's inner workings, Media Matters, July 14, 2004 have accused Fox of having a pervasive conservative bias; on many Web sites and blogs, \\"fair and balanced\\" became widely used as an ironic euphemism for perceived right-wing media bias on Fox and other media outlets. On May 31, 2003, the cable network C-SPAN2 broadcast a panel discussion on political books that was taking place at BookExpo America, a trade show for the book publishing industry. The panel included Franken, whose Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them was scheduled for release in the autumn, and Fox News personality Bill O'Reilly, who was promoting his own book Who's Looking Out For You?, which was due for release at about the same time as Franken's. Saying that he felt the need to explain why a fellow panelist's face was on the cover of a book entitled Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them, Franken told a story about O'Reilly's incorrect statements that Inside Edition, a show that he had formerly worked for, had won two Peabody Awards, when it in fact won a Polk Award for work conducted after O'Reilly severed his ties with the program. The two then engaged in a heated confrontation, which culminated in O'Reilly shouting \\"Shut up! Shut up!\\" after Franken interrupted him. A link to footage of the program quickly circulated among blogs, which had the effect of providing valuable publicity for Franken's upcoming book. The lawsuit On August 7, 2003, Fox News filed for relief in New York State court. On August 14, Franken's publisher removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on federal question grounds. In what author and editor Richard Blow described as \\"an eight-inch thick legal filing,\\"Fox as Hound , TomPaine.com 08/19/2003 the network contended that it had been irreparably harmed by the publicity surrounding Franken's use of the phrase \\"fair and balanced\\" on the preliminary cover of Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them, which Fox claimed it had first become aware of following the BookExpo panel discussion in May. The filing stated that Franken had \\"been described as a 'C-level political commentator' who is 'increasingly unfunny'\\", and claimed that the comedian was \\"shrill and unstable\\" and had \\"appeared either intoxicated or deranged\\" at a press correspondents' dinner in April 2003. The filing cited only two sources for those quotes, one of which was a website to which Bill O'Reilly was a contributor, and the other was a website where anyone could contribute. Fox also requested a temporary restraining order (denied August 20, 2003) to restrain the distribution of the book until their request for a preliminary injunction was heard by the court.Fox News Network, L.L.C. v. Penguin Group (USA), Inc., 2003 WL 23281520 (S.D.N.Y, August 20, 2003). In response, Franken joked that he had trademarked the word \\"funny\\", and that Fox had infringed his intellectual property rights by characterizing him as \\"unfunny.\\" Franken's then-unreleased book subsequently rose to the #1 sales position on Amazon.com's best-seller list from number 489 (his second #1 bestseller after Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations, which attained the top of the New York Times' list in 1996). On August 22, U.S. District Court judge Denny Chin heard arguments from attorneys representing the plaintiff and the defendant regarding Fox News's request for an injunction to prevent Franken from releasing the book with its current title. In a hearing punctuated at times by laughter from the assembled spectators, Chin questioned Fox News attorney Dori Ann Hanswirth harshly about her contention that the phrase \\"fair and balanced\\" on the cover of Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them was likely to confuse consumers into believing that the book was produced or endorsed by Fox News Channel. At one point he asked Hanswirth, \\"Do you think that the reasonable consumer would believe, seeing the word lie above Mr. O'Reilly's face, that Mr. O'Reilly or Fox were endorsing this book?\\" Chin denied the injunction and said that the case was \\"wholly without merit, both factually and legally\\". He went on to suggest that Fox News' trademark on the phrase \\"fair and balanced\\" could be invalid. Three days later, Fox News Channel filed to drop the lawsuit. Though O'Reilly denies it, Franken believes that the commentator goaded Fox News into suing him. In the paperback edition of his book, Franken recalls an incident at the BookExpo where, as O'Reilly and Fox News colleague Shepard Smith were waiting for a hotel shuttle, O'Reilly said, \\"I'm gonna sue him! I'm gonna sue him!\\" A week later, Franken's publisher received a letter from Fox saying they were planning to sue.

Rep. 2254 (2003) Judge Chin said the case was an easy one, and chided Fox News Network LLC for bringing its complaint to court. The judge said, \\"Of course, it is ironic that a media company that should be fighting for the First Amendment is trying to undermine it.\\" After effects The most direct result of the suit was a windfall for Franken and his publisher, Penguin Group (USA). The book had originally been slated for release on September 22, 2003, but the publicity resulting from the suit prompted Penguin to move the release date up to August 21 and print an extra 50,000 copies, for a total of 435,000; the book was an immediate bestseller. For its part, Fox News Channel was ridiculed by commentators and bloggers on both sides of the political divide, many of whom suggested that the network had filed the suit to placate Bill O'Reilly in the wake of his run-in with Franken at the BookExpo panel.http://www.usenet.com/newsgroups/talk.politics.misc/msg02738.html Drawing on Judge Chin's concluding remarks, Franken suggested that Fox News adopt \\"wholly without merit\\" as its new slogan to replace the possibly invalid \\"fair and balanced\\". In a more serious response, in December 2003, the Independent Media Institute, publishers of the left-wing website AlterNet, filed a petition to cancel the trademark in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, calling it \\"notoriously misdescriptive.\\"Independent Media Institute v.

Fox News Network, LLC, No. 92042790, Board's Decision: Dismissal Without Prejudice (July 6, 2005 T.T.A.B.) In 2004, Franken began hosting a talk show, originally titled The O'Franken Factor, on the Air America Radio network. The program's title was a jab at Bill O'Reilly's show, named The O'Reilly Factor. Franken said that he chose the name to \\"annoy and bait\\" O'Reilly into filing another lawsuit.Business  kgw.com  News for Oregon and SW Washington Three months later, Franken changed the name to The Al Franken Show, which he hosted until 2007, when he announced his candidacy for a United States Senate seat in Minnesota that was to be challenged in 2008.

It is a colourless substance, volatile and poisonous, with a boiling point of 23.5 ¬∞C. It is the predominant tautomer of cyanic acid H‚ÄìO‚ÄìC‚â°N. The derived anion is the same as that of cyanic acid, and is called cyanate. The related functional group ‚ÄìN=C=O is isocyanate; it is distinct from cyanate ‚ÄìO‚ÄìC‚â°N, fulminate ‚ÄìO‚ÄìN+‚â°C‚àí, and nitrile oxide ‚ÄìC‚â°N+‚ÄìO‚àí. Isocyanic acid was discovered in 1830 by Liebig and W√∂hler. Isocyanic acid is the simplest stable chemical compound that contains carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, the four most commonly found elements in organic chemistry and biology. It is the only fairly stable one of the four linear isomers with molecular formula HOCN that have been synthesized, the others being cyanic acid H‚ÄìO‚ÄìC‚â°N and the elusive fulminic acid H‚ÄìC‚â°N+‚ÄìO‚àí and isofulminic acid H‚ÄìO‚ÄìN+‚â°C‚àí.William R.

Properties =Physical= The pure compound has a melting point of ‚àí86.8 ¬∞C and a boiling point of 23.5 ¬∞C, so it is volatile at ambient temperatures.Greenwood, p323Wells, p 722 =Acidity= In aqueous solution it is a weak acid. :HNCO H+ + NCO‚àí; pKa ‚âà 3.7.IUPAC SC-Database A comprehensive database of published data on equilibrium constants of metal complexes and ligands =Decomposition= Isocyanic acid hydrolyses to carbon dioxide and ammonia: : HNCO + H2O ‚Üí CO2 + NH3 =Oligomerization= At sufficiently high concentrations, isocyanic acid oligomerizes to give the trimer cyanuric acid and cyamelide, a polymer. These species usually are easily separated from liquid- or gas-phase reaction products. Cyanuric acid itself decomposes on further heating back to isocyanic acid. =Stability in solution= Dilute solutions of isocyanic acid are stable in inert solvents, e.g. ether and chlorinated hydrocarbons.A. S. Narula, K. Ramachandran ‚ÄúIsocyanic Acid‚Äù in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, 2001, John Wiley & Sons, New York. Article Online Posting Date: April 15, 2001. =Reactions= Isocyanic acid reacts with amines to give ureas (carbamides): :HNCO + RNH2 ‚Üí RNHC(O)NH2. This reaction is called carbamylation. HNCO adds across electron-rich double bonds, such as vinylethers, to give the corresponding isocyanates. Isocyanic acid, HNCO, is a Lewis acid whose free energy, enthalpy and entropy changes for its 1:1 association with a number of bases in carbon tetrachloride solution at 25¬∞C have been reported. Nelson, J. (1970) Hydrogen-bonded complexes of isocyanic acid: Infrared spectra and thermodynamic measurements. Spectrochimica Acta Part A: Molecular Spectroscopy 26,109-120. The acceptor properties of HNCO are compared with other Lewis acid in the ECW model. =Tautomerism= The tautomer, known as cyanic acid, HOCN, in which the oxygen atom is protonated, is unstable to decomposition, but in solution it is present in equilibrium with isocyanic acid to the extent of about 3%. The vibrational spectrum is indicative of the presence of a triple bond between the nitrogen and carbon atoms. Low-temperature photolysis of solids containing HNCO creates the tautomer cyanic acid H-O-C‚â°N, also called hydrogen cyanate. Pure cyanic acid has not been isolated, and isocyanic acid is the predominant form in all solvents. Sometimes information presented for cyanic acid in reference books is actually for isocyanic acid. Preparation Isocyanic acid can be made by protonation of the cyanate anion, such as from salts like potassium cyanate, by either gaseous hydrogen chloride or acids such as oxalic acid. : H+ + NCO- ‚Üí HNCO HNCO also can be made by the high- temperature thermal decomposition of the trimer cyanuric acid: : C3H3N3O3 ‚Üí 3 HNCO In the reverse of the famous synthesis of urea by Friedrich W√∂hler, :OC(NH2)2 ‚Üí HNCO + NH3 isocyanic acid is produced and rapidly trimerizes to cyanuric acid. Occurrence Isocyanic acid has been detected in many kinds of interstellar environments. Isocyanic acid is also present in various forms of smoke, including smog and cigarette smoke. It was detected using mass spectrometry, and easily dissolves in water, posing a health risk to the lungs.

Flowers was best known for the comedy act he created with his puppet Madame. His performances as \\"Wayland Flowers and Madame\\" were a major national success on stage and on screen in the 1970s and 1980s. Career Wayland Parrott Flowers Jr. was born November 26, 1939 in, and raised in, Dawson, Georgia. Flowers created Madame in the mid-1960s. Flowers' first big break was an appearance on The Andy Williams Show. The character of Madame is an \\"outrageous old broad\\" who entertains with double entendres and witty comebacks. Bedecked in fabulous evening wear and \\"summer diamonds\\" (\\"Some are diamonds; some are not\\"), Madame's look is based on movie stars such as Gloria Swanson. Many believe that Madame is based on a Washington, DC gay icon, waitress and restaurant hostess Margo MacGregor. Madame's many TV appearances included Laugh-In; a long run on the game show Hollywood Squares (replacing Paul Lynde in The Center Square); a recurring comedy skit on Solid Gold; a regular on ABC's short-lived summer replacement show called Keep on Truckin', TV guest spots; and as the star of her own syndicated 1982 sitcom, Madame's Place. Flowers and Madame were in the center square on the final NBC episode of Hollywood Squares in June 1980; host Peter Marshall asked Madame the final game question of the daytime series, which was \\"Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Strauss lived in the same place. Where did they all live?\\" Madame's \\"comic\\" answer: \\"At the YMCA!\\" Then her \\"serious\\" answer: Germany. (The correct answer: Austria.) Flowers' other puppets included Crazy Mary (an escapee from Bellevue mental hospital), Jiffy (a Harlem harlot with a heart of brass), Macklehoney (a crotchety, retired vaudeville comedian). His puppet Smedley worked with Marlo Thomas on Free to Be... You and Me. Personal life Flowers was one of the first mainstream entertainers who was openly gay. Death Sometime during his four-year stint on Solid Gold, Flowers was diagnosed with HIV. He did not publicly announce his diagnosis and continued to perform. Flowers eventually developed Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer. On September 2, 1988, he collapsed onstage while performing at Harrah's in Lake Tahoe. After a brief hospitalization, he returned to his hometown of Dawson, Georgia, where he visited family. Upon returning to Los Angeles, he moved into the hospice Hughes House for palliative care. On October 11, 1988, Flowers died at Hughes House of complications from AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma at the age of 48.Los Angeles County death certificate number 38819045556, registered October 13, 1988 by Donald W. Long, M.D. His remains were cremated at Grand View Memorial Park & Crematory in Glendale, California, and shipped back to his hometown of Dawson, Georgia, where they were interred at Cedar Hills Cemetery. Flowers bequeathed his estate to his manager, Marlena Shell. Legacy Flowers wrote the book Madame: My Misbegotten Memoirs, which was published in 1983. Ten years after Flowers's death, Madame returned to the stage with entertainer Rick Skye. After appearances on several television shows, performances of \\"It's Madame with an E\\" began November 15, 2008, at Resorts Atlantic City.Resorts Atlantic City website, retrieved November 10, 2008 During 2010, the show also toured the US.

According to Yves Le Bec, the Flettner Fl 282 was the world's first series production helicopter.Le Bec, Yves. La v√©ritable histoire de l'h√©licopt√®re: De 1486 √† 2005 (French). Grossfeldstrasse, Switzerland: H√©lico revue, 2005.. Design and development The Fl 282 Kolibri was an improved version of the Flettner Fl 265 announced in July 1940, which pioneered the same intermeshing rotor configuration that the Kolibri used. It had a 7.7 litre displacement, seven-cylinder Siemens-Halske Sh 14 radial engine of 150-160 hp mounted in the center of the fuselage, with a transmission mounted on the front of the engine from which a drive shaft ran to an upper gearbox, which then split the power to a pair of opposite-rotation drive shafts to turn the rotors. The Sh 14 engine was a venerable, tried-and-true design with low specific power output and low power/weight ratio (20.28 hp/L, 0.54 hp/lb, which could (anecdotally) run for up to 400 hours without major servicing, as opposed to the more powerful 27 litre displacement, nine-cylinder BMW/Bramo Fafnir 750 hp radial engine powering the larger Focke Achgelis Fa 223 helicopter, whose higher output (27.78 hp/L, 0.62 hp/lb), more modern design required moderate maintenance as often as every 25 hours (such as changing spark plugs, etc, well within the norm for modern radial engines of that era). While such a heavy and low-powered engine would work well in a very small craft like the Fi 282, to try and scale it up and use an engine of equivalent power/weight ratio in the 700-1000 hp class would result in a massive and heavy engine leaving little excess capacity for cargo or passengers. 750 hp was the lowest rating that the Fafnir was available in - indeed, it was a low- power, low maintenance design compared with many other engines of this era. The Fl 282's fuselage was constructed from steel tube covered with doped fabric, and it was fitted with a fixed tricycle undercarriage. The German Navy was impressed with the Kolibri and wanted to evaluate it for submarine spotting duties, ordering an initial 15 examples, to be followed by 30 production models. Flight testing of the first two prototypes was carried out through 1941, including repeated takeoffs and landings from a pad mounted on the German cruiser K√∂ln. The first two \\"A\\" series prototypes had enclosed cockpits; all subsequent examples had open cockpits and were designated \\"B\\" series. In case of an engine failure, the switch from helicopter to autorotation was automatic.Smith and Kay 1978, p. 596.Lang, Gerhard. Flettner Fl 282 (The Luftwaffe Profile Series, No 6). Atglen, Pennsylvania: Schiffer Publishing, 1996. . Three-bladed rotors were installed on a test bed and found smoother than the vibrating 2-blade rotor, but the concept was not pursued further.

However, as the war progressed, the Luftwaffe began considering converting the Fl 282 for battlefield use. Until this time the craft had been flown by a single pilot, but by then a position for an observer was added at the very rear of the craft, resulting in the B-2 version.Jackson 2005, p. 110.

After many years in storage this aircraft was placed on loan to Sampson AFB, New York on 23 June 1954. When Sampson AFB closed in the summer of 1956, all items then on exhibit were returned to the Museum or disposed of in place.

On a steam locomotive, the cutoff is controlled by the reversing gear. The point at which the inlet valve closes and stops the entry of steam into the cylinder from the boiler plays a crucial role in the control of a steam engine. Once the valve has closed, steam trapped in the cylinder expands adiabatically. The steam pressure drops as it expands. A late cutoff delivers full steam pressure to move the piston through its entire stroke, for maximum start-up forces. But, since there will still be unexploited pressure in the cylinder at the end of the stroke, this is achieved at the expense of engine efficiency. In this situation the steam will still have considerable pressure remaining when it is exhausted resulting in the characteristic ‚Äúchuff chuff‚Äù sound of a steam engine. An early cutoff has greater thermodynamic efficiency but results in a lower Mean effective pressure so less average force on the piston and is used for running the engine at higher speeds.  Explanation  Schematic Indicator diagram of pressure in a steam locomotive cylinder. The pressure in the cylinder declines after cutoff as the steam pushes the piston down its bore Cutoff is one of the four valve events. Early cutoff is used to increase the efficiency of the engine by allowing the steam to expand for the rest of the power stroke, yielding more of its energy and conserving steam. This is known as expansive working. Late cutoff is used to provide maximum torque to the shaft at the expense of efficiency and is used to start the engine under load. Cutoff is conventionally expressed as percentage of the power stroke of the piston; if the piston is at a quarter of its stroke at the cutoff point, the cutoff is stated as 25%. Smaller stationary steam engines generally have a fixed cutoff point while, in large ones, the speed and power output is generally governed by altering the cutoff, frequently under governor control using an expansion valve or trip gear. In steam engines for transport, it is desirable to be able to alter the cutoff over a wide range. In steam locomotives, for starting and at low speed and heavy load, the cylinders need moderate steam supply (by throttling the steam supply pressure) throughout most of the piston stroke. The lower pressure is used to avoid \\"wheel spin\\" that frequently occurs when starting a train onto motion. After establishing train moderate speed, the cutoff is reduced, and higher boiler pressure is admitted into the cylinders, which results in much better engine efficiency. In a two-cylinder locomotive, for example, the maximum or 'full gear' cutoff is typically about 85%. At high speeds, the cutoff may be significantly reduced. Steam engines used in boats and ships typically also use variable cutoff valve gear, while some operate with a fixed cutoff, with speed being controlled through the regulator. Providing variable cutoff is an important function of the valve gear.

He was born a Mississippi sharecropper and as a young man was several times an inmate of the Mississippi prison system. He was paid $20,000, and credited, for a four-decade-old lead-vocalist performance in a prison work song used in the 2000 film O Brother, Where Art Thou? In 1959, Carter was a prisoner in Camp B of Parchman Farm, Mississippi State Penitentiary near Lambert, Quitman County, Mississippi, when Alan Lomax and Shirley Collins recorded him in stereo sound leading a group of prisoners singing \\"Po' Lazarus\\", an African- American \\"bad man ballad\\" (which is also a work song), while chopping logs in time to the music. The recording and an iconic cover photograph of the prisoners in striped uniforms were issued on volume nine, Bad Man Ballads, in Alan Lomax's 1959 Southern Journey LP series on Atlantic Records.The recording is the second track of Bad Man Ballads CD, Vol. 5, in the Southern Journey Series of the Alan Lomax Collection, produced by Anna Lomax Wood and Jeffrey Greenburg, and issued by Rounder Records in 1997. Decades later, the recording was licensed for use in the soundtrack to the Coen brothers' film O Brother, Where Art Thou? with music produced by T-Bone Burnett. Burnett's soundtrack topped the Billboard charts for many weeks and went on to win a Grammy for Album of the Year. Alan Lomax's daughter Anna Lomax Chairetakis (now Anna Lomax Wood), director of the Alan Lomax Archive, and Don Fleming, director of Licensing for the Archive, hoped that Carter was still alive and determined to track him down: > Searching through the archives of the Mississippi penal system, Social > Security files, property records and other public records and various > databases, the record's producer, T-Bone Burnett; the Lomax archives; and an > investigative journalist for a Florida newspaper found Mr. Carter in Chicago > with his wife, Rosie Lee Carter, a longtime minister of the Holy Temple > Church of God. Chairetakis and Fleming flew to Chicago to personally present Carter with a royalty check.See Bernard Weinraub, \\"An ex-convict, A Hit Album, An Ending Fit for Hollywood\\", New York Times , March 3, 2003. Carter who had spent much of his adult life working as a shipping clerk, told them he did not remember having sung the song 40 years previously. Fleming then informed him that the soundtrack album was outselling the latest CDs of Michael Jackson and Mariah Carey. \\"I told him, you beat both of them out,\\" Mr. Fleming said. \\"He got a real kick out of that. He left the room to roll a cigarette and when he came back, he said, You tell Michael that I'll slow down so that he can catch up with me.\\" Carter flew to Los Angeles to attend the Grammy Award ceremony and to Tennessee for the benefit concert held in Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, which featured repeat performances by the performers of other numbers on the soundtrack (although Carter himself did not perform). As the other prisoners have not been identified (and likely never will be), the official credit for the artist on the soundtrack is for \\"James Carter & the Prisoners\\". Carter died November 26, 2003, in Chicago, at age 77.

He also served as the U.S. Ambassador to Denmark from 1998 to 2001. Early life, education and career Swett was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania and moved to New Hampshire with his family as a child. He attended Yale University and then became an architect in San Francisco. Political career Katrina and Dick Swett, at 2008 Milford Labor Day parade Swett became active in the Democratic Party and eventually began a political career. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in November 1990 but was defeated at the election in November 1994. In the run up to Swett's 1990 campaign, former Governor of New Hampshire Meldrim Thomson, Jr. complained unsuccessfully that listing him on the ballot as \\"Dick Swett\\" would be unlawfully misleading, since he was listed as \\"Lantos-Swett\\" in the telephone book, voter registration, deed to real property, and business. Mitt Romney donated $250 to his 1992 campaign. They were fellow Mormons with homes on Lake Winnipesaukee. Gale Biography In Context. In 1994, Swett voted for a bill to ban assault weapons that narrowly passed by two votes in the United States House of Representatives. His stand resulted in numerous threats against his life. In 1996, Swett ran as a Democratic Party candidate for the Class 2 seat in the United States Senate from New Hampshire, against incumbent Republican Bob Smith, but was narrowly defeated. Smith had established himself as the most conservative Senator from the Northeast, and Bill Clinton's coattails nearly caused his defeat. On the night of the election many American media networks incorrectly projected that Swett had won. In 1998, Bill Clinton appointed Swett to be United States Ambassador to Denmark. He served in that position until 2001, and then moved back to New Hampshire. Swett and Larry Coben wrote the national energy policy for Senator Joseph Lieberman's 2004 presidential campaign. Swett returned to the field of architecture, assuming the position of Managing Principal for the Washington office of Leo A.

Causes are varied and can be difficult to discern. Although not every patient needs treatment, most people seek treatment for severe nocturia, waking up to void more than 2‚Äì3 times per night. Prevalence Studies show that 5‚Äì15% of people who are 20‚Äì50 years old, 20‚Äì30% of people who are 50‚Äì70 years old, and 10‚Äì50% of people 70+ years old, urinate at least twice a night. Nocturia becomes more common with age. More than 50 percent of men and women over the age of 60 have been measured to have nocturia in many communities. Even more over the age of 80 are shown to experience symptoms of nocturia nightly. Nocturia symptoms also often worsen with age. Although nocturia rates are about the same for both genders, data shows that there is a higher prevalence in younger women than younger men and older men than older women. Impact Although nocturia is little-known to the general public, some research suggests that more than 60% of people are negatively affected by it. The resulting insomnia and sleep deprivation can cause exhaustion, changes in mood, sleepiness, impaired productivity, fatigue, increased risk of accidents, and cognitive dysfunction. 25% of falls that older individuals experience happen during the night, of which 25% occur while waking up to void. A quality of life test for people who experience nocturia was published in 2004. The pilot study was conducted only on men. Diagnosis Nocturia diagnosis requires knowing the patient's nocturnal urine volume (NUV). The ICS defines NUV as ‚Äúthe total volume of urine passed between the time the individual goes to bed with the intention of sleeping and the time of waking with the intention of rising.‚Äù Thus, NUV excludes the last void before going to bed, but includes the first morning void if the urge to urinate woke the patient. The amount of sleep a patient gets, and the amount they intend to get, are also considered in a diagnosis. As with any patient, a detailed history of the problem is required to establish what is normal for that patient. The principal diagnostic tool for nocturia is the voiding bladder diary. Based on information recorded in the diary, a physician can classify the patient as having global polyuria, nocturnal polyuria, or bladder storage problems. A voiding bladder diary should record: * number of voids * timing of voids * volume voided * volume and time of fluid intake Patients should include the first morning void in the NUV. However, the first morning void is not included with the number of nightly voids.  Causes  =Polyuria= Polyuria is excessive or an abnormally large production or passage of urine. Increased production and passage of urine may also be termed diuresis. Polyuria is usually viewed as a symptom or sign of another disorder (not a disease by itself), but it can be classed as a disorder, at least when its underlying causes are not clear. Global polyuria Global polyuria is the continuous overproduction of urine that is not only limited to sleep hours. Global polyuria occurs in response to increased fluid intake and is defined as urine outputs of greater than 40 mL/kg/24 hours. The common causes of global polyuria are primary thirst disorders such as diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus (DI). Urination imbalance may lead to polydipsia or excessive thirst to prevent circulatory collapse. Central diabetes insipidus is caused by low levels of Vasopressin (also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH), arginine vasopressin (AVP) or argipressin). ADH is produced in the hypothalamus and stored in and released from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH increases water absorption in the collecting duct systems of kidney nephrons, subsequently decreasing urine production. ADH regulate hydration levels in the body. that helps regulates water levels. In nephrogenic DI, the kidneys do not respond properly to the normal amount of ADH. Diagnosis of DI can be made by an overnight water deprivation test. This test requires the patient to eliminate fluid intake for a fixed period of time, usually around 8‚Äì12 hours. If the first morning void is not highly concentrated, the patient is diagnosed with DI. Central DI usually can be treated with a synthetic replacement of ADH, called desmopressin. Desmopressin is taken to control thirst and frequent urination. Although there is no substitute for nephrogenic DI, it may be treated with careful regulation of fluid intake. Nocturnal polyuria Nocturnal polyuria is defined as an increase in urine production during the night but with a proportional decrease in daytime urine production that results in a normal 24-hour urine volume. With the 24-hour urine production within normal limits, nocturnal polyuria can be translated to having a nocturnal polyuria index (NPi) greater than 35% of the normal 24-hour urine volume. NPi is calculated simply by dividing NUV by the 24-hour urine volume. Similar to the inability of control urination, a disruption of arginine vasopressin (ADH) levels has been proposed for nocturia. Compared with the normal patients, nocturia patients have a nocturnal decrease in ADH level. Other causes of nocturnal polyuria include diseases such as * congestive heart failure * nephritic syndrome * liver failure * lifestyle patterns such as excessive nighttime drinking * sleep apnea increasing obstructive airway resistance. Obstructive sleep apnea sufferers have shown to have increases in renal sodium and water excretion that are mediated by elevated plasma atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) levels. ANH is released by cardiac muscle cells in response to high blood volume. When activated, ANH releases water, subsequently increasing urine production. =Bladder storage= Normal human bladder storage capacity varies from person to person and is considered 400 ‚Äì 600 mL.\\"Picture of the Bladder\\" Matthew Hoffman MD, webmd.com A bladder storage disorder is any factor that increases the frequency of small volume voids. These factors are usually related to lower urinary tract symptoms that affect the capacity of the bladder. Some patients with nocturia have neither global nor nocturnal polyuria according to the above criteria. Such patients most likely have a bladder storage disorder that impacts their nighttime voiding or a sleep disorder. Nocturnal bladder capacity (NBC) is defined as the largest voided volume during the sleep period. Decreased NBC can be traced to a decreased maximum voided volume or decreased bladder storage. Decreased NBC can be related to other disorders such as: * benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also known as prostate enlargement * neurogenic bladder dysfunction * learned voiding dysfunction * anxiety disorders * certain pharmacological agents. =Mixed cause= A significant number of nocturia cases occur from a combination of causes. Mixed nocturia is more common than many realise and is a combination of nocturnal polyuria and decreased nocturnal bladder capacity. In a study of 194 nocturia patients: * 7% were determined to solely have nocturnal polyuria * 57% solely had decreased NBC * 36% had a mixed cause of the two Multifactor caused nocturia is often unrelated to an underlying urological condition. Mixed nocturia is diagnosed through the maintenance and analysis of bladder diaries of the patient. Assessment of cause contributions are done through formulas.  Management  =Lifestyle changes= Although there is no cure for nocturia, many actions can manage the symptoms. * Prohibiting caffeine and alcohol intake. Both are diuretic. * Beverage consumption regulation. In regard to Nocturia this specifically means avoiding consuming fluids 3 or more hours before bedtime so giving the bladder less fluid to store overnight. This especially helps people with urgency incontinence. However, one study regarding geriatric patients showed that it reduced voiding at night by only a small amount and is sub-optimal for managing nocturia in older people. Fluid restriction does not help people who have nocturia due to gravity-induced third spacing of fluid because fluid is mobilized when they lie in a reclining position. * Compression stockings may be worn through the day to prevent fluid from accumulating in the legs, unless heart failure or another contraindication is present. * Drugs that increase the passing of urine can help decrease the third spacing of fluid, but they could also increase nocturia. =Medications= * ADH replacements such as Desmopressin and Vasopressin * Selective Alpha-1 blockers are the most commonly used medicine to treat BPH. Alpha-1 blockers are first line treatment for the symptoms of BPH in men. Doxazosin, terazosin, alfuzosin and tamsulosin have all been well established in treatment to reduce lower urine tract symptoms (LUTS) caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. They are all believed to be similarly effective for this purpose. First generation alpha-1 blockers, like prazosin are not recommended to treat lower urinary tract symptoms because of their blood- pressure-lowering effect. Later generation drugs in this class are used for this purpose. In some cases alpha-1 blockers have been used in combined therapy with 5-alpha reductase blockers. Dutasteride and tamsulosin are on the market as combined therapy and results have shown that they improve symptoms significantly versus monotherapy. * Antimuscarinic agents such as oxybutynin, tolterodine, solifenacin are especially used in patients who suffer from nocturia due to an overactive bladder and urgency incontinence because they help bladder contractility. =Surgery= If the cause of nocturia is related to benign prostatic hyperplasia or an overactive bladder, surgical actions may be sought out. * Surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia includes increasingly popular and minimally invasive laser surgery. * Surgical correction of the pelvic organ prolapse * sacral nerve stimulation * Bladder augmentation * Detrusor muscle myectomy  See also  * Polyuria * Enuresis References  External links  * http://nocturia.elsevierresource.com/ * Nocturia Resource Centre\\", linked to the journal European Urology , has been providing a continuous update on nocturia, causes, consequences and clinical approaches.

Development The PW-5 was designed for, and won a competition held by the International Gliding Commission for a simple, low cost sailplane that would form the basis for a new competition class, the IGC World Class. Unlike other soaring competition classes, the World Class designation would guarantee that all pilots participated on an equal footing, and that pilots could not gain advantage by spending large amounts of money. The PW-5 was unanimously chosen from 42 design proposals in IGC international World Class design competition. In November 1989, the IGC issued a worldwide call for proposals. By February 1990, it had received 84 requests for design specifications from 25 countries. By August 1990, the IGC had received 42 design proposals from 20 countries. In September 1990, after reviewing the proposals, many of which came with models, the IGC recommended that 11 designs from 9 countries proceed to the prototype competition. In October 1992, the IGC inspected and tested 6 prototypes from 5 countries at Oerlinghausen Germany. After further review and collecting manufacturing data, in spring 1993 the IGC declared the PW-5, designed by a faculty/student team at Warsaw University of Technology, the first World Class glider. The glider was designed at the Faculty of Power and Aeronautical Engineering of the Warsaw University of Technology under the supervision of Roman ≈öwitkiewicz. It was originally built by PZL at its factory in ≈öwidnik and first flew in 1993. By the end of 2000 the new private company PZL-Bielsko1 was established by the original members of the design team from Warsaw University of Technology and the DWLKK company. A new factory at Bielsko produced a modified version of PW-5 glider called B1-PW-5.≈ªaczek, Jaros≈Çaw. \\"World Class Glider B1-PW-5\\" undated , retrieved 1 August 2008. Because its cost was comparable to the cost of the older Club class gliders of higher performance it did not sell as well as expected and the World class competitions were not very popular as well. In total fewer than 200 PW-5s have been built, though over 70 have been exported to the United States, where there is a keen following.

It is a beta-hemolytic, catalase- negative, and facultative anaerobe. S. agalactiae is the species designation for the only species of streptococci belonging to the group B of the Rebecca Lancefield classification of streptococci (Lancefield grouping). GBS is surrounded by a bacterial capsule composed of polysaccharides (exopolysacharide). The species is subclassified into ten serotypes (Ia, Ib, II‚ÄìIX) depending on the immunologic reactivity of their polysaccharide capsule. This is why the plural term group B streptococci (referring to the serotypes) and the singular term group B streptococcus (referring to the single species) are both commonly encountered. In general, GBS is a harmless commensal bacterium being part of the human microbiota colonizing the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract of up to 30% of healthy human adults (asymptomatic carriers). Nevertheless, GBS can cause severe invasive infections especially in newborns, the elderly, and people with compromised immune systems.Œ≤-hemolytic colonies of Streptococcus agalactiae, blood agar 18h at 36¬∞C S. agalactiae is also a common veterinary pathogen, because it can cause bovine mastitis (inflammation of the udder) in dairy cows. The species name agalactiae meaning \\"of no milk\\", alludes to this. Streptococcus agalactiae on granada agar, anaerobic incubation Granadaene Positive CAMP test indicated by the formation of an arrowhead where Streptococcus agalactiae meets the Staphylococcus aureus (white middle streak) Laboratory identification GBS grows readily on blood agar plates as colonies surrounded by a narrow zone of Œ≤-hemolysis. GBS is characterized by the presence in the cell wall of the antigen group B of Lancefield classification (Lancefield grouping) that can be detected directly in intact bacteria using latex agglutination tests. The CAMP test is also another important test for identification of GBS. The CAMP factor produced by GBS acts synergistically with the staphylococcal Œ≤-hemolysin inducing enhanced hemolysis of sheep or bovine erythrocytes. GBS is also able to hydrolyze hippurate and this test can also be used to identify presumptively GBS. Hemolytic GBS strains produce an orange-brick-red non-isoprenoid polyene pigment (granadaene) when cultivated on granada medium that allows its straightforward identification. GBS can also be identified using MALDI-TOF (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization- Time of Flight) instruments. GBS colonies can additionally be identified tentatively after their appearance in chromogenic agar media, nevertheless GBS-like colonies that develop in chromogenic media should be confirmed as GBS using additional reliable tests (e.g.latex agglutination or the CAMP test) to avoid potential mis-identification. A summary of the laboratory techniques for GBS identification is depicted in Ref 7.  GBS colonization GBS is a normal component of the intestinal and vaginal microbiota in some women, GBS is an asymptomatic (presenting no symptoms) colonizer of the gastrointestinal tract and vagina in up to 30% of otherwise healthy adults, including pregnant women. GBS colonization may be permanent, intermittent or temporary. In different studies, GBS vaginal colonization rate ranges from 0% to 36%, most studies reporting colonization rates in sexually active women over 20%. It has been estimated that maternal GBS colonization worldwide is 18%, with regional variation from 11% to 35%. These variations in the reported prevalence of asymptomatic GBS colonization could be related to the detection methods used, and differences in populations sampled.  Virulence As other virulent bacteria, GBS harbors an important number of virulence factors (virulence factors are molecules produced by bacteria that boosts their capacity to infect and damage human tissues), the most important being the capsular polysaccharide (rich in sialic acid) and a pore-forming toxin, Œ≤-hemolysin. Today it is considered that GBS pigment and hemolysin are identical or closely related molecules. GBS infection in newborns GBS colonization usually does not cause problems in healthy women, nevertheless during pregnancy it can sometimes cause serious illness for the mother and the newborn. GBS is the leading cause of bacterial neonatal infection in the baby during gestation and after delivery with significant mortality rates in premature infants. GBS infections in the mother can cause chorioamnionitis (a severe infection of the placental tissues) infrequently, postpartum infections (after birth) and it had been related with prematurity and fetal death. GBS urinary tract infections (UTI) may also induce labor and cause premature delivery. In the western world, GBS (in the absence of effective prevention measures) is the major cause of several bacterial infections of the newborn neonatal infection sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis, which can lead to death or long-term sequelae. GBS neonatal infection typically originates in the lower reproductive tract of infected mothers. GBS infections in newborns are separated into two clinical syndromes, early-onset disease (EOD) and late- onset disease (LOD). EOD manifests from 0 to 7 living days in the newborn, most of the cases of EOD being apparent within 24h of birth. The most common clinical syndromes of EOD are sepsis without apparent focus, pneumonia, and less frequently meningitis. EOD is acquired vertically (vertical transmission), through exposure of the fetus or the baby to GBS from the vagina of a colonized woman, either intrautero or during birth after rupture of membranes. Infants can be infected during passage through the birth canal, nevertheless newborns that acquire GBS through this route can become only colonized, and these colonized infants habitually do not develop EOD. Roughly 50% of newborns to GBS colonized mothers are also GBS colonized and (without prevention measures) 1‚Äì2% of these newborns will develop EOD. In the past, the incidence of EOD ranged from 0.7 to 3.7 per thousand live births in the US and from 0.2 to 3.25 per thousand in Europe. In 2008, after widespread use of antenatal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), the CDC reported an incidence of 0.28 cases of EOD per thousand live births in the US. It has been indicated that where there was a policy of providing IAP for GBS colonization the overall risk of EOGBS is 0.3%. Since 2006 to 2015 the incidence of GBS EOD decreased from 0.37 to 0.23 per thousand live births in the US. Though maternal GBS colonization is the key determinant for EOD, other factors also increase the risk. These factors include onset of labor before 37 weeks of gestation (premature birth), prolonged rupture of membranes (‚â•18h before delivery), intra-partum fever (>38 ¬∞C, >100.4 ¬∞F), amniotic infections (chorioamnionitis), young maternal age, and low levels of GBS anticapsular polysaccharide antibodies in the mother. Nevertheless, most babies who develop EOD are born to GBS colonized mothers without any additional risk factor. A previous sibling with EOD is also an important risk factor for development of the infection in subsequent deliveries, probably reflecting a lack of GBS polysaccharides protective antibodies in the mother. Heavy GBS vaginal colonization is also associated with a higher risk for EOD. Overall, the case‚Äìfatality rates from EOD have declined, from 50% observed in studies from the 1970s to 2 to 10% in recent years, mainly as a consequence of improvements in therapy and management. Fatal neonatal infections by GBS are more frequent among premature infants. GBS LOD affects infants from 7 days to 3 months of age and is more likely to cause bacteremia or meningitis. LOD can be acquired from the mother or from environmental sources. Hearing loss and mental impairment can be a long-term sequela of GBS meningitis. In contrast with EOD, the incidence of LOD has remained unchanged at 0.26 per 1000 live births in the US. S. agalactiae neonatal meningitis does not present with the hallmark sign of adult meningitis, a stiff neck; rather, it presents with nonspecific symptoms, such as fever, vomiting and irritability, and can consequently lead to a late diagnosis.  Prevention of neonatal infection  The only reliable way to prevent EOD currently is intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), that is to say administration of antibiotics during delivery. It has been proved that intravenous penicillin or ampicillin administered for at least 4 hours before delivery to GBS colonized women is very effective at preventing vertical transmission of GBS from mother to baby and EOD. Cefazolin, clindamycin, and vancomycin are used to prevent EOD in infants born to penicillin-allergic mothers. There are two ways to identify female candidates to receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis: a risk-based approach or a culture-based screening approach. The culture-based screening approach identifies candidates to receive IAP using lower vaginal and rectal cultures obtained between 36 and 37 weeks' gestation (32‚Äì34 weeks of gestation for women with twins) and IAP is administered to all GBS colonized women. The risk-based strategy identifies candidates to receive IAP by the aforementioned risk factors known to increase the probability of EOD without considering if the mother is or is not a GBS carrier. IAP is also recommended for women with intrapartum risk factors if their GBS carrier status is not known at the time of delivery, for women with GBS bacteriuria during their pregnancy, and for women who have had an infant with EOD previously. The risk-based approach for IAP is in general less effective than the culture-based approach because in most of the cases EOD develops among newborns, which are born to mothers without risk factors. In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in collaboration with several professional groups, issued its revised GBS prevention guidelines. In 2018, the task of revising and updating the GBS prophylaxis guidelines was transferred from the CDC to ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The ACOG committee issued an update document on Prevention of Group B Streptococcal Early-Onset Disease in Newborns in 2019. This document does not introduce important changes from the CDC guidelines. The key measures necessary for preventing neonatal GBS early onset disease continue to be universal prenatal screening by culture of GBS from swabs collected from the lower vagina and rectum, correct collection and microbiological processing of the samples, and proper implementation of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. The ACOG now recommends performing universal GBS screening between 36 and 37 weeks of gestation. This new recommendation provides a five-week window for valid culture results that includes births that occur up to a gestational age of at least 41 weeks. The culture-based screening approach is followed in most developed countries such as the United States, France, Spain Belgium, Canada, Argentina, and Australia. The risk-based strategy is followed in the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. = Screening for GBS colonization = Though the GBS colonization status of women can change during pregnancy, cultures to detect GBS carried out ‚â§5 weeks before delivery predict quite accurately the GBS carrier status at delivery. In contrast, if the prenatal culture is performed more than five weeks before delivery it is unreliable for predicting accurately the GBS carrier status at delivery. The clinical specimens recommended for culture of GBS at 36‚Äì37 weeks‚Äô gestation (32‚Äì34 weeks of gestation for women with twins) are swabs collected from lower vagina and rectum through the anal sphincter. Following the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of United States (CDC) these swabs should be placed into a non-nutritive transport medium and later inoculated into a selective enrichment broth, Todd Hewitt broth with selective antibiotics (enrichment culture). After incubation the enrichment broth is subcultured to blood agar plates and GBS like colonies are identified by the CAMP test or using latex agglutination with GBS antisera. After incubation the enrichment broth can also be subcultured to granada medium agar where GBS grows as pink-red colonies or to chromogenic agars, where GBS grows as colored colonies. GBS-like colonies that develop in chromogenic media should be confirmed as GBS using additional reliable tests to avoid mis-identification. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA hybridization probes have been developed for identifying GBS directly from recto-vaginal samples, but they still cannot replace antenatal culture for the most accurate detection of GBS carriers.

Vagino-rectal culture 18h incubation 36¬∞C anaerobiosis Streptococcus agalactiae colonies in chromogenic medium (ChromID CPS chromogenic agar) = Vaccination = Though IAP for EOD prevention is associated with a large decline in the incidence of the disease, there is, however, no effective strategy for preventing late-onset neonatal GBS disease. Vaccination is considered an ideal solution to prevent not only EOD and LOD but also GBS infections in adults at risk. Nevertheless, though research and clinical trials for the development of an effective vaccine to prevent GBS infections are underway, no vaccine was available in 2019. The capsular polysaccharide of GBS is not only an important GBS virulence factor but it is also an excellent candidate for the development of an effective vaccine. Protein-based vaccines are also in development.  GBS infection in adults  GBS is also an important infectious agent able to cause invasive infections in adults. Serious life-threatening invasive GBS infections are increasingly recognized in the elderly and individuals compromised by underlying diseases such as diabetes, cirrhosis and cancer. GBS infections in adults include urinary tract infection, skin and soft-tissue infection (skin and skin structure infection) bacteremia, osteomyelitis, meningitis and endocarditis. GBS infection in adults can be serious and related with high mortality. In general penicillin is the antibiotic of choice for treatment of GBS infection. Gentamicin (for synergy with penicillin G or ampicillin) can also be used in patients with life-threatening invasive GBS.  Nonhuman infections  In addition to human infections, GBS is a major cause of mastitis (an infection of the udder) in dairy cattle and an important source of economic loss for the industry. GBS in cows can either produce an acute febrile disease or a subacute more chronic condition. Both lead to diminishing milk production (hence its name: agalactiae meaning \\"of no milk\\"). Outbreaks in herds are common, so this is of major importance for the dairy industry, and programs to reduce the impact of S. agalactiae disease have been enforced in many countries over the last 40 years. GBS also causes severe epidemics in farmed fish, causing sepsis and external and internal hemorrhages, having been reported from wild and captive fish involved in epizootics in many countries. Vaccination is an effective method to prevent pathogenic diseases in aquaculture and different kinds vaccines to prevent GBS infections have been developed recently. GBS has also been found in many other animals, such as camels, dogs, cats, crocodiles, seals, elephants and dolphins.

The British managed to hold their ground until after sunset, when the natives withdrew. Bouquet ordered a redoubt constructed on Edge Hill, and the British placed their wounded and livestock in the center of the perimeter. Concrete flour bags at the Bushy Run Battlefield monument on Edge Hill. According to one account, the allied tribes attacked in the morning, but were themselves ambushed by the sentries relieved from their evening duty. With the surprise attack of the sentries, from a flank, and a frontal assault by the main British column, the outnumbered Indians fled in a disorganized retreat. A second account holds that the warriors attacked in the morning and \\"redoubled their efforts to break the British line.\\" As the tribesmen became bolder, Bouquet realized the combat was nearing a crisis. Determined to lure his attackers close enough to maim them, the British leader deliberately weakened one section of his line. Spotting the gap in the enemy defenses, the native warriors rushed forward. Instead, the British soldiers fired a volley in their faces and \\"made terrible havock\\" with the bayonet. The surviving warriors fled and were unable to rally.Brumwell, pp 220-221 This account concurs with that written by Richard Cannon in 1845 in the history of the 42nd Highlanders Regiment in which says that the Colonel of the regiment called in his posts as if about to retreat and the Indians believing that they had victory rushed forward from behind their cover becoming fully exposed. They were then instantly charged in the front and in the flank, by two companies of the 42nd Highlanders, and were thrown into confusion and routed. Having dispersed its attackers, Bouquet's column headed to Bushy Run, a mile along the Forbes road, where there was badly needed water. The battle has since been attributed to the Bushy Run location, despite the main fighting taking place in Edge Hill. Bouquet then marched to the relief of Fort Pitt.

The battle cost the lives of 50 British soldiers, including 29 of the 42nd Highlanders, seven of the 60th Royal Americans, six of the 77th Highlanders, and eight civilians and volunteers. The confederacy of the Delaware, Shawnee, Mingo, and Huron suffered an unknown number of casualties, which includes two prominent Delaware chiefs; estimates by contemporaries placed the total Indian loss at about 60.Warren and son, p. 24 The warrior Killbuck later told Sir William Johnson that only 110 Indians were engaged. Bouquet estimated he fought an equal number as his own force. One contemporary report claimed 20 Indians were killed and many more wounded. The result of the battle inspired in the British \\"widespread relief on the frontier\\", since the Indians had finally been defeated on their own ground, prompting one newspaper to exclaim, \\"that Indians are no more invulnerable than other Men, when attacked on equal Terms, and especially by British Troops.\\"Brumwell, p 221 The site of the battle is now Bushy Run Battlefield Park.

Family Francis Vere, born about 1560, was the second son of Geoffrey Vere of Crepping Hall, Essex, a younger son of John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford, and Elizabeth Trussell. His mother was Elizabeth Hardekyn (d. December 1615), daughter of Richard Hardekyn (d.1558) of Wotton House near Castle Hedingham. He had three brothers, John Vere (c. 15581624) of Kirby Hall near Castle Hedingham, Robert Vere (b. 1562), and Sir Horatio Vere (b. 1565), and a sister, Frances Vere (born 1567), who married, as his second wife, the colonial adventurer and author Sir Robert Harcourt (1574/5‚Äì1631), of Nuneham on 20 March 1598.; ; ; . Military career The young Francis Vere first went on active service under Leicester in 1585, and was soon in the thick of the war raging in the Low Countries. At the siege of Sluys he greatly distinguished himself under Sir Roger Williams and Sir Thomas Baskerville. In 1588 he was in the garrison of Bergen op Zoom, which delivered itself from the Spanish besiegers led by the Duke of Parma by its own good fighting. Vere as a result of his heroic deeds was Knighted by Lord Willoughby on the field of battle. In the next year Sir Francis became sergeant major-general of the English and Scottish troops in the Low Countries, and soon afterwards the chief command devolved upon him. This position he retained during fifteen campaigns, with almost unbroken success. Working in close cooperation with the Dutch forces under Maurice of Nassau, he helped, step by step secure the country for the cause of independence. He garnered more rewards and respect from Maurice and the Dutch with his decisive actions in the defeat of Parma during the Siege of Knodsenburg outside Nijmegen in July 1591. The future prominent dramatist and poet Ben Jonson served as a volunteer under his command. Vere won the reputation of being one of the best English soldiers of the day. His troops acquired a cohesion and a training based on the Dutch model fitting them to face the best Spanish troops, and his camp became the fashionable training-ground of all aspiring English soldiers, amongst others not only his younger brother Horace, but men of such note as Ferdinando (Lord) Fairfax, Gervase Markham and Captain Myles Standish. He was elected Member of Parliament for Leominster in 1593. Battle of Nieuwpoort, 1600. From The commentaries of Sr. Francis Vere Sir Francis served in the C√°diz expedition of 1596, made an important contribution to the victory of Turnhout in 1597 and in 1598 was entrusted with the negotiation of the treaty whereby the Anglo-Dutch alliance was revised; for himself he obtained the governorship of Brill and the rank of general. The culminating point of his career came when, in 1600, on the advice of Oldenbarnevelt, the States General decided to carry the war into the enemy's country. In the Battle of Nieuwpoort (2 July 1600), one of the most desperately contested battles of the age, Maurice of Nassau, with support by Vere, defeated the veteran Spanish troops of the archduke Albert. This was followed by the celebrated defense of Ostend from July 1601 to March 1602. Vere came back to England in 1602, but the remaining English troops kept fighting side by side with the Dutch until the surrender of the garrison in September 1604.Williams, Penry (1998). The Later Tudors: England, 1547-1603. Oxford University Press, p. 380. Vere returned to the Low Countries with more troops in 1602 and with Maurice laid siege to the Spanish garrison at Grave but before that place surrendered he was injured under the right eye. He recovered after six months in Ryswick, was again on active service with the Dutch throughout 1603-04 and continued with the governorship of Brill. Retirement When James I made peace with Spain in 1604, Vere retired from active service and spent the remainder of his days in country life in England, occupying himself with the compilation of his Commentaries of the Divers Pieces of Service that he had taken part in (which remained in manuscript form until 1657; reprinted in Arbers English Garner, 1883). Vere spent a great deal of time visiting his friend, Sir Julius Caesar in Mitcham in Surrey, on the road from London to Nonsuch. Caesar was on his second marriage to Alice Dent and she had a daughter from a previous marriage - Elizabeth Dent. During these visits he quickly became enamoured with Elizabeth. They fell in love and Caesar consented to a marriage. Since Elizabeth‚Äôs sister was also engaged, Caesar arranged a grand wedding for his stepdaughters on 26 October 1607. Vere received a dowry of ¬£2,000 and settled property on her for life. She was 16 and he was 47. They were married for 22 months before his death and there is no record of any children.

In 1982 she starred opposite Sondra Locke in the Jackie Cooper directed Emmy Award winning television film Rosie: The Rosemary Clooney Story. In this film she played Betty Clooney, the sister of Rosemary Clooney. In 1984, Penelope appeared in the Golden Globe award-winning television movie The Burning Bed starring Farrah Fawcett. In 1985 she guest starred on an episode of The Hitchhiker. =Film= Milford's first film appearance was as an extra on the Norman Mailer film Maidstone (1970). In 1974, she appeared in the movie Man on a Swing. She next played a fictional actress named Lorna Sinclair in Ken Russell's BAFTA-nominated 1977 film Valentino, about the life of actor Rudolph Valentino. In 1978, she was cast as Vi Munson in Coming Home, and she was nominated for an Academy Award, for Best Supporting Actress. In 1980, she appeared in the movie The Last Word. She plays a supporting role in Take This Job and Shove It and Endless Love. In 1982, she starred in the horror film Blood Link and then starred in the 1983 adventure film The Golden Seal. After this time, her film appearances became less frequent, not appearing until the 1989 cult film Heathers. Her last few films include Cold Justice (1989), Miss Missouri (1990), Normal Life (1996), Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Part II (1996) and Night of the Lawyers (1997).

Alcoholic beverages are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a Group 1 carcinogen (carcinogenic to humans). IARC classifies alcoholic beverage consumption as a cause of female breast, colorectal, larynx, liver, esophagus, oral cavity, and pharynx cancers; and as a probable cause of pancreatic cancer. 3.6% of all cancer cases and 3.5% of cancer deaths worldwide are attributable to consumption of alcohol (specifically, ethanol). Even light and moderate alcohol consumption increases cancer risk in individuals. Some nations have introduced alcohol packaging warning messages that inform consumers about alcohol and cancer. The alcohol industry has tried to actively mislead the public about the risk of cancer due to alcohol consumption, in addition to campaigning to remove laws that require alcoholic beverages to have cancer warning labels.

BBC. 8 April 2011 Alcohol as a carcinogen and cocarcinogen The International Agency for Research on Cancer (Centre International de Recherche sur le Cancer) of the World Health Organization has classified alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen, similar to arsenic, benzene, and asbestos. Its evaluation states, \\"There is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of alcoholic beverages in humans. ‚Ä¶Alcoholic beverages are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).\\" p8 Mechanisms = Acetaldehyde = Acetaldehyde is produced by the liver as it breaks down ethanol. The liver then normally eliminates 99% of the acetaldehyde. An average liver can process 7 grams of ethanol per hour. For example, it takes 12 hours to eliminate the ethanol in a bottle of wine, giving 12 hours or more of acetaldehyde exposure. A study of 818 heavy drinkers found that those who are exposed to more acetaldehyde than normal through a defect in the gene for alcohol dehydrogenase are at greater risk of developing cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract and liver. There are many associations between alcohol drinking and different types of cancer. Data from 2009 indicated 3.5 percent of cancer deaths in the U.S. were due to consumption of alcohol.2.What is the evidence that alcohol drinking is a cause of cancer? cancer.gov =Reviews= In a review, P√∂schl and Seitz list some possible mechanisms of alcohol as a carcinogen: * local effects of alcohol * metabolism to acetaldehyde (which may be mutagenic at physiologically meaningful levels) * induction of CYP2E1 * nutritional deficiencies * interactions with retinoids * alcohol and methylation * alcohol and immune surveillance Purohita et al. propose an overlapping list: # production of acetaldehyde, which is a weak mutagen and carcinogen # induction of cytochrome P450 2E1 and associated oxidative stress and conversion of procarcinogens to carcinogens # depletion of S-adenosylmethionine and, consequently, induction of global DNA hypomethylation; # induction of increased production of inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins and components of extracellular signal- regulated kinase‚Äìmitogen-activated protein kinase signaling # accumulation of iron and associated oxidative stress # inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 and increased estrogen responsiveness (primarily in breast) # impairment of retinoic acid metabolism. Boffetta and Hashibe list plausible mechanisms as including: * a genotoxic effect of acetaldehyde * increased oestrogen concentration * a role as solvent for tobacco carcinogens * production of reactive oxygen species and nitrogen species * changes in folate metabolism Individuals who both smoke and drink are at a much higher risk of developing mouth, tracheal, and esophageal cancer. Research has shown their risk of developing these cancers is 35 times higher than in individuals who neither smoke nor drink. This evidence may suggest that there is a cocarcinogenic interaction between alcohol and tobacco-related carcinogens. =Local carcinogenic effect of ethanol= The risk of cancer associated with alcohol consumption is higher in tissues in closest contact on ingestion of alcohol, such as the oral cavity, pharynx and esophagus. This is explained by the fact that ethanol is a proven mutagen and in addition, metabolite of ethanol (acetaldehyde) produced in the liver is highly carcinogenic, thus explaining both local (mouth, throat, esophageal cancers) as well as distant (skin, liver, breast) cancers. It is well known that ethanol causes cell death at the concentrations present in alcoholic beverages. Few cells survive a one- hour exposure to 5‚Äì10% ethanol or a 15-second exposure to 30‚Äì40% ethanol in cell culture, where surviving cells might undergo genomic changes leading to carcinogenesis. But recent evidence suggests that the cytotoxic effect of ethanol on the cells lining the oral cavity, pharynx and esophagus activates the division of the stem cells located in deeper layers of the mucosa to replace the dead cells. Every time stem cells divide, they become exposed to unavoidable errors associated with cell division (e.g., mutations arising during DNA replication and chromosomal alterations occurring during mitosis) and also become highly vulnerable to the genotoxic activity of DNA-damaging agents (e.g., acetaldehyde and tobacco carcinogens). Alcohol consumption probably increases the risk of developing cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx and esophagus by promoting the accumulation of cell divisions in the stem cells that maintain these tissues in homeostasis. Because the cytotoxic activity of ethanol is concentration-dependent, the risk of these cancers will not only increase with increasing amounts of ethanol, but also with increasing concentrations; an ounce of whisky is probably more carcinogenic when taken undiluted than when taken mixed with non-alcoholic beverages. The local cytotoxic effect of ethanol may also explain the known synergistic effect of alcohol and tobacco use on the risk of these cancers. =Epithelial- mesenchymal transition= A study found that alcohol stimulates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which ordinary cancer cells change into a more aggressive form and begin to spread throughout the body.Rush University Medical Center Alcohol Activates Cellular Changes That Make Tumor Cells Spread 26 October 2009 =Effect of alcohol on the progress of cancer when established= A study of the influence of alcohol intake on tumor growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with type C cirrhosis, found that alcohol influenced tumor volume doubling time (TVDT). A study of chick embryos suggests that alcohol stimulates their tumor growth by fueling the production of a growth factor that stimulates blood vessel development in tumors. A 2006 study in mice showed moderate drinking resulted in larger and stronger tumors via a process known as angiogenesis. A study where high amounts of alcohol were given to mice suggests that it accelerates their cancer growth by speeding up the loss of body fat and depressing immune activity. Genetic variation and cancer risk A study found that \\"the ADH1C*1 allele and genotype ADH1C*1/1 were significantly more frequent in patients with alcohol-related cancers‚Ä¶\\" A European study has found two gene variants which offer \\"significant\\" protection against mouth and throat cancers. Alcohol is a known porphyrinogenic chemical. Several European studies have linked the inherited hepatic porphyrias with a predisposition to hepatocellular carcinoma. Typical risk factors for HCC need not be present with the acute hepatic porphyrias, specifically acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria. Porphyria cutanea tarda is also associated with HCC, but with typical risk factors including evidence of hepatotropic viruses, hemochromatosis and alcoholic cirrhosis. Tyrosinemia Type I, an inherited disorder in tyrosine metabolism impacting the second enzyme in the heme metabolic pathway is associated with a high risk of developing HCC in younger populations, including children. Risk factor for specific cancers = Moderate consumption increases risk = A study found that, \\"Increasing but moderate alcohol consumption in women was determined to be associated with an increased risk of cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus, larynx, rectum, breast, and liver‚Ä¶\\".  Cancers of the mouth, esophagus, pharynx, and larynx  Endoscopic image of patient with esophageal adenocarcinoma seen at gastro-esophageal junction. Alcohol consumption at any quantity is a risk factor for cancers of the mouth, esophagus, pharynx and larynx. The U.S. National Cancer Institute states \\"Drinking alcohol increases the risk of cancers of the mouth, esophagus, pharynx, larynx, and liver in men and women, ‚Ä¶ In general, risks increases above baseline with any alcohol intake (mild; <2 glass of wine per week) and increases significantly with moderate alcohol intake (one glass of wine per day) with highest risk in those with greater than 7 glasses of wine per week. (A drink is defined as 12 ounces of regular beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor.) ‚Ä¶ Also, using alcohol with tobacco is riskier than using either one alone, because it further increases the chances of getting cancers of the mouth, throat, and esophagus.\\" The federal government‚Äôs Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 defines moderate alcohol drinking as up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men. Heavy alcohol drinking is defined as having more than three drinks on any day or more than seven drinks per week for women and more than four drinks on any day or more than 14 drinks per week for men. The International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) Consortium co-ordinated a meta-study on the issue. A study looking at laryngeal cancer and beverage type concluded, \\"This study thus indicates that in the Italian population characterized by frequent wine consumption, wine is the beverage most strongly related to the risk of laryngeal cancer.\\" A review of the epidemiological literature published from 1966 to 2006 concluded that: * The risk of esophageal cancer nearly doubled in the first two years following alcohol cessation, a sharp increase that may be due to the fact that some people only stop drinking when they are already experiencing disease symptoms. However, risk then decreased rapidly and significantly after longer periods of abstention. * Risk of head and neck cancer only reduced significantly after 10 years of cessation. * After more than 20 years of alcohol cessation, the risks for both cancers were similar to those seen in people who never drank alcohol. A study concluded that for every additional drink regularly consumed per day, the incidence of oral cavity and pharynx cancers increases by 1 per 1000. The incidence of cancers of the esophagus and larynx increase by 0.7 per 1000. A 2008 study suggests that acetaldehyde (a breakdown product of alcohol) is implicated in oral cancer.Alcohol and oral cancer research breakthrough Breast cancer Mastectomy specimen containing a very large cancer of the breast (in this case, an invasive ductal carcinoma). Alcohol is a risk factor for breast cancer in women. A woman drinking an average of two units of alcohol per day has an 8% higher risk of developing breast cancer than a woman who drinks an average of one unit of alcohol per day. A study concluded that for every additional drink regularly consumed per day, the incidence of breast cancer increases by 11 per 1000.

Alcohol has been identified as a risk factor for endometrial cancer. Data however, on the association of alcohol intake and endometrial cancer is conflicting.

Evidence suggests that a high intake of alcohol is associated with gallbladder cancer. Men may be at a higher risk of alcohol- related gallbladder cancer than women. Ovarian cancer \\"Thus, the results of this study suggest that relatively elevated alcohol intake (of the order of 40 g per day or more) may cause a modest increase of epithelial ovarian cancer risk.\\". \\"Associations were also found between alcohol consumption and cancers of the ovary and prostate, but only for 50 g and 100 g a day.\\" \\"Statistically significant increases in risk also existed for cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, liver, female breast, and ovaries.\\" \\"Thus, this pooled analysis does not provide support for an association between moderate alcohol intake and ovarian cancer risk.\\" Prostate cancer \\"Data from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study showed only a weak association between overall alcohol intake and prostate cancer risk, and no association at all between red wine intake and prostate cancer risk.\\" A meta-analysis published in 2001 found a small but significant increased risk for men drinking more than 50 g/day of alcohol, with a slightly higher risk for men consuming more than 100 g/day. Since that analysis, cohort studies in America have found increased risks for men drinking moderate amounts of spirits, and for 'binge drinkers, but moderate consumption of beer or wine has not been linked to an increased risk.Cancer Research UK Prostate Cancer risk factors Alcohol consumption of 50 g and 100 g per day is also associated with cancers of the ovary and prostate.Alcohol consumption and cancer risk However, one study concludes, that moderate alcohol consumption increases the risk of prostate cancer. Liquor, but not wine or beer, consumption was positively associated with prostate cancer.\\" The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center found that men who consumed four or more glasses of red wine per week had a 50 percent reduction in the risk of developing prostate cancer. They \\"found no significant effects ‚Äì positive nor negative ‚Äì associated with the consumption of beer or hard liquor and no consistent risk reduction with white wine, which suggests that there must be a beneficial compound in red wine that other types of alcohol lack.

Pancreatic cancer Whilst the association between alcohol abuse and pancreatitis is well established the association between alcohol consumption and pancreatic cancer is less clear. Overall the evidence suggests a slightly increased risk of pancreatic cancer with chronic heavy alcohol consumption but the evidence remains conflicting with a number of studies finding no association., but no increased risk for people consuming up to 30g of alcohol a day Overall, the association is consistently weak and the majority of studies have found no association. Although drinking alcohol excessively is a major cause of chronic pancreatitis, which in turn predisposes to pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis associated with alcohol consumption is less frequently a precursor for pancreatic cancer than other types of chronic pancreatitis.Pancreatic cancer risks and causes. Cancer Research UK Some studies suggest a relationship, the risk increasing with increasing amount of alcohol intake. The risk is greatest in heavy drinkers,Schottenfeld, D. and J. Fraumeni, ed. (1996) Cancer epidemiology and prevention. 2nd ed., Oxford University Press: Oxford mostly on the order of four or more drinks per day. There appears to be no increased risk for people consuming up to 30g of alcohol a day, which is approximately 2 alcoholic beverages/day, so most people who take alcohol do so at a level that \\"is probably not a risk factor for pancreatic cancer\\". A pooled analysis concluded, \\"Our findings are consistent with a modest increase in risk of pancreatic cancer with consumption of 30 or more grams of alcohol per day\\". Several studies caution that their findings could be due to confounding factors. Even if a link exists, it \\"could be due to the contents of some alcoholic beverages\\" other than the alcohol itself. One Dutch study even found that drinkers of white wine had lower risk. \\"About 7 out of 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis are due to long term heavy drinking. Chronic pancreatitis is a known risk factor for cancer of the pancreas. But chronic pancreatitis that is due to alcohol doesn't increase risk as much as other types of chronic pancreatitis. So if there is a link with alcohol and pancreatic cancer risk, it is only very slight.\\" \\"Our findings indicate that alcohol drinking at the levels typically consumed by the general population of the United States is probably not a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Our data suggest, however, that heavy alcohol drinking may be related to pancreatic cancer risk.\\" \\"Relative risks of pancreatic cancer increased with the amount of alcohol consumed (Ptrend = 0.11) after adjustment for age, smoking status, and pack-years of smoking.\\" \\"Alcoholics had only a modest 40% excess risk of pancreatic cancer ‚Ä¶ The excess risk for pancreatic cancer among alcoholics is small and could conceivably be attributed to confounding by smoking.\\" \\"It was shown that the relative risk of cancer of the pancreas increases with fat and alcohol intakes, ‚Ä¶ Alcohol may be not directly involved in the aetiology of cancer of the pancreas: its effect could be due to the contents of some alcoholic beverages.\\" \\"When compared with data from non-drinkers, the cumulative lifetime consumption of all types of alcohol in grams of ethanol‚Ä¶ beer, spirits, red wine and fortified wine was not related to risk. The consumption of white wine was inversely associated with risk‚Ä¶. The uniformly reduced risk estimates for the lifetime number of drinks of white wine were based on small numbers‚Ä¶.\\" \\"For the most part, consumption of total alcohol, wine, liquor and beer was not associated with pancreatic cancer.\\" \\"Data from these two large cohorts do not support any overall association between coffee intake or alcohol intake and risk of pancreatic cancer.\\" \\"Our findings are consistent with a modest increase in risk of pancreatic cancer with consumption of 30 or more grams of alcohol per day.\\" =Not suspected to increase risk= This section lists cancers where alcohol is not listed as a risk factor and where papers have been published. Childhood astrocytoma A study concluded that foetal exposure to alcohol is not associated with childhood astrocytoma. Bile duct cancer A review of the literature found that there is no association between alcohol use and bile duct cancer. Bladder cancer \\"Epidemiological data on alcohol drinking and bladder cancer are suggestive of no association, although findings were not always consistent. For both habits, an explanation of the moderate increase in risk observed in some investigations might be attributed to residual confounding by smoking, or to an association between alcohol, coffee, and yet unidentified risk factors for bladder cancer.\\" Cervical cancer A study concluded \\"that alcoholic women are at high risk for in situ and invasive cervical cancer\\" but attributed this to indirect, lifestyle-related reasons. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) breast cancer \\"DCIS patients and control subjects did not differ with respect to oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy, alcohol consumption or smoking history, or breast self-examination. Associations for LCIS were similar.\\" Ependymoma A review of the basic literature found that consumption of beer was associated with increased risk in one study but not in another Intraocular and uveal melanomas A study found no association between alcohol and uveal melanoma. Nasopharynageal cancer / Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) A systematic review found evidence that light drinking may decrease the risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma whereas high intake of alcohol may increase the risk. Neuroblastoma A few studies have indicated an increased risk of neuroblastoma with use of alcohol during pregnancy. Salivary gland cancer (SGC) Alcohol use is associated with an increased risk of salivary gland cancer. Testicular cancer A review concluded that \\"There is no firm evidence of a causal relation between behavior risks [tobacco, alcohol and diet] and testicular cancer.\\" Thyroid cancer A 2009 review found that alcohol intake does not affect the risk of developing thyroid cancer. However, a 2009 study of 490,000 men and women concluded that alcohol may reduce the risk of thyroid cancer. A 2009 study of 1,280,296 women in the United Kingdom concluded, \\"The decreased risk for thyroid cancer that we find to be associated with alcohol intake is consistent with results from some studies, although a meta-analysis of 10 case‚Äìcontrol studies and two other cohort studies reported no statistically significant associations.\\" Vaginal cancer A Danish study found that \\"Abstinence from alcohol consumption was associated with low risk for both VV-SCCvagina and VV-SCCvulva in our study.\\" A study concluded that alcoholic women are at high risk for cancer of the vagina. In both studies, indirect, lifestyle-related reasons were cited. Vulvar cancer One study reported \\"No consistent association emerged between milk, meat, liver, alcohol and coffee consumption and risk of vulvar cancer.\\" A Danish study found the reverse, that alcohol consumption is significantly associated with VV-SCCvagina and VV-SCCvulva cancer. A Swedish study concluded that alcoholic women are at no higher risk for cancer of the vulva. =Might reduce risk=  Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL)  A study concluded, \\"The results of this large-scale European study ‚Ä¶ suggested a protective effect of alcohol on development of NHL for men and in non- Mediterranean countries.\\" A population based case-control study in Germany found that alcohol reduced the risk of HL for both men and women but more so for men, whose risk was lowered by 53%. A population-based case-control study in Italy reported a protective effect of alcohol consumption on risk of HL among non-smokers. Analysis of data from a series of case-control studies in Northern Italy revealed a modest positive effect of alcohol on lowering risk of HL among both smokers and non-smokers. Kidney cancer (Renal cell carcinoma) (RCC) \\"Moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a lower risk of renal cell cancer among both women and men in this pooled analysis\\" \\"This pooled analysis found an inverse association between alcohol drinking and RCC. Risks continued to decrease even above eight drinks per day (i.e. >100 g/day) of alcohol intake, with no apparent levelling in risk.\\" A study concluded, \\"Results from our prospective cohort study of middle-aged and elderly women indicate that moderate alcohol consumption may be associated with decreased risk of RCC.\\" Researchers who conducted a study in Iowa reported that \\"In this population-based case-control investigation, we report further evidence that alcohol consumption decreases the risk of RCC among women but not among men. Our ability to show that the association remains after multivariate adjustment for several new confounding factors (i.e., diet, physical activity, and family history) strengthens support for a true association. Another study found no relationship between alcohol consumption and risk of kidney cancer among either men or women. A Finnish study concluded, \\"These data suggest that alcohol consumption is associated with decreased risk of RCC in male smokers. Because most of the risk reductions were seen at the highest quartile of alcohol intake and alcohol is a risk factor for a number of cancers particularly among smokers, these data should be interpreted with caution.\\" \\"Our data suggest an inverse association between alcohol intake and risk of renal cell cancer‚Ä¶\\" Compared with nondrinkers, men who drank one or more drinks per day had a 31% lower risk of kidney cancer among 161,126 Hawaii-Los Angeles Multiethnic Cohort participants. Non- Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) A study concluded, \\"People who drink alcoholic beverages might have a lower risk of NHL than those who do not, and this risk might vary by NHL subtype.\\" \\"Compared with nondrinkers, alcohol consumers had a lower risk for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma overall ‚Ä¶ and for its main subtypes.\\" A study concluded, \\"Nonusers of alcohol had an elevated NHL risk compared with users‚Ä¶\\" Some studies have found a protective effect on NHL of drinking some forms of alcoholic beverage or in some demographic groups.

The study drew parallels with the long-standing activities of the tobacco industry. It also claimed that there was a particular focus on misleading women drinkers, because much of the misinformation about cancer produced by these companies was found to be focused on breast cancer. The alcohol industry around the world has also campaigned to remove laws that require alcoholic beverages to have cancer warning labels.

Biography Elisabeth Congdon was born to mining magnate Chester Adgate Congdon, and his wife, Clara Hesperia Bannister Congdon on April 22, 1894 in Duluth, Saint Louis County, Minnesota, USA. In 1905, Chester began building Glensheen Historic Estate, a 39-room mansion on their estate in Duluth, Minnesota, seeing it finished 3 years later. Chester died in 1916, and Clara many years later in 1950, upon which Elisabeth inherited Glensheen. In 1932, Elisabeth, a single woman in her late thirties, adopted a daughter, Jacqueline Barnes and renamed her Marjorie Mannering Congdon. A second daughter, Jennifer Susan Congdon, was adopted in 1935. Marjorie was the \\"black sheep\\" of the family, as she constantly borrowed money from her mother and married numerous times. Early in her life Marjorie was diagnosed a sociopath, was put into institutions and for a time appeared to be improving. Marjorie had seven children by her first husband, Dick LeRoy, and she spoiled them with luxuries, the majority of which were furnished by Elisabeth. She was divorced after twenty years of marriage. Marjorie's second marriage was to a man named Roger Sipe Caldwell. She and Caldwell kept asking Elisabeth for money, reportedly so they could realize their dream of a horse ranch. On June 27, 1977, Elisabeth Congdon and her nurse Velma Pietila (born April 26, 1911) were found murdered. Elisabeth was found suffocated with a satin pillow in her bed and Velma, who was lying on a window seat, had been beaten to death with a candlestick. The motive was initially unclear because few valuables were looted from the room. The murder happened in Elisabeth's older sister Helen's bedroom. Some think it happened in Elisabeth's room, which was furnished with expensive articles of furniture from France. After her elder sister moved out of the mansion, Elisabeth took over her room as it was bigger. This room is recognizable by the gray color scheme and the pink tile around the fireplace. Elisabeth's daughter Marjorie was to receive $8 million at the time of her mother's death. Three days before Elisabeth's death, Marjorie had authorized a paper saying Roger was to receive about $2.5 million of her share. Based on evidence found at the scene and later in Roger and Marjorie's possession, they were arrested. Roger Caldwell was tried first and convicted in 1978. Marjorie was acquitted in 1979. The Minnesota Supreme Court overturned Caldwell's conviction in 1983. Rather than risk an acquittal at retrial, the prosecution offered him a plea deal, a confession, guilty plea to second-degree murder and time served (he had served five years of a twenty- year sentence). He confessed to both murders on July 5, 1983 and was released. He committed suicide on May 18, 1988. In his suicide note he claimed he was innocent of killing Elisabeth Congdon. He never got any of the promised money from Marjorie. Years later, Marjorie was convicted of insurance fraud and arson and was sent to Perryville prison in Arizona on July 19, 1993. Though she was suspected in the death of her third (bigamous) husband, Wally Hagen, Arizona authorities have never brought charges against her for that crime. Children of her third husband's first marriage suspect that she was involved in the unexpected death of Mr. Hagen's first wife. Marjorie was released from Arizona State Prison on January 5, 2004. She was arrested again, on March 23, 2007, in Tucson, Arizona, at her residence at an assisted living facility on charges of computer fraud and several other counts. In November 2008, Marjorie Congdon LeRoy Caldwell Hagen pleaded guilty to fraud after illegally taking funds from the bank account of Roger Sammis after his death. Mr. Sammis had been under her care before his death, and some suspect Ms. Congdon of foul play.

The main protagonists were the prime minister, Winston Churchill, and the foreign secretary, Viscount Halifax. The dispute escalated to crisis point and threatened the continuity of the Churchill government. With the British Expeditionary Force in retreat to Dunkirk and the fall of France seemingly imminent, Halifax believed that the government should explore the possibility of a negotiated peace settlement. His hope was that Hitler's ally, the still-neutral Italian dictator Mussolini, would broker an agreement. When a memorandum proposing this approach was discussed at the War Cabinet on 27 May, Churchill opposed it and urged his colleagues to fight on without negotiations. He was supported in the war cabinet by its two Labour Party members, Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood, and also by the Secretary of State for Air, Sir Archibald Sinclair, who as leader of the Liberal Party was co-opted to the war cabinet for its meetings about the proposed negotiations. Churchill's biggest problem was that he was not the leader of the Conservative Party and he needed to win the support of ex-Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, without which he could have been forced to resign by the large Conservative majority in the House of Commons. On 28 May, Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax by calling a meeting of his 25-member outer cabinet, at which his resolve to fight on was unanimously supported. Halifax then accepted the rejection of his proposal, though he may have been more influenced by the loss of Chamberlain's support. There is a consensus among historians that Chamberlain's eventual support for Churchill was a critical turning point in the war. Background =Churchill becomes Prime Minister= Neville Chamberlain The 1935 general election had resulted in a victory of the National Government (comprised principally of the Conservative Party, along with the Liberal National Party and the National Labour Organisation) victory with a substantial majority and Stanley Baldwin became Prime Minister. In May 1937, Baldwin retired and was succeeded by Neville Chamberlain who continued Baldwin's foreign policy of appeasement in the face of German, Italian and Japanese aggression. Having signed the Munich Agreement with Hitler in 1938, Chamberlain became alarmed by the dictator's continuing aggression and, in August 1939, signed the Anglo-Polish military alliance which guaranteed British support for Poland if attacked by Germany. Chamberlain issued the declaration of war against Germany on 3 September 1939 and formed a war cabinet which included Winston Churchill (who had been out of office since June 1929) as First Lord of the Admiralty and Viscount Halifax as Foreign Secretary. Dissatisfaction with Chamberlain's leadership became widespread in the spring of 1940 when Germany successfully invaded Norway. On 7‚Äì8 May, the House of Commons debated the Norwegian campaign, which had gone badly for the Allies. The Norway Debate escalated into widespread criticism not only of the campaign but also of the Conservative-led government's conduct of the entire war. At the end of the second day, the opposition Labour Party forced a division which amounted to a motion of no confidence in Chamberlain's leadership. Chamberlain as Prime Minister was heavily criticised on both sides of the House by members expressing a strong desire for national unity. The Conservative rebels mostly wanted the formation of a true national government which would include the opposition Labour and Liberal groups; the Liberal Nationals having essentially become part of the Conservative Party at this point, an arrangement that would be formalised after the war ended, and the National Labour group having had minimal influence in the government since the death of former Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. Churchill made the closing speech in the Norway Debate and mounted a strong defence of Chamberlain, ending his speech with these words: The government's notional majority was 213, but 41 members who normally supported the government voted with the Opposition while an estimated 60 other Conservatives deliberately abstained. The government still won the vote by 281 to 200, but their majority was reduced to 81. This would normally be sustainable but, at a time of national crisis with Britain losing the war, it was a shattering blow for Chamberlain. Clement Attlee Next day, Thursday, 9 May, Chamberlain attempted to form a National Coalition Government. In talks at 10, Downing Street with Churchill and Halifax, Chamberlain indicated his willingness to resign if that was necessary for Labour to enter such a government. Labour's leader Clement Attlee and his deputy Arthur Greenwood then joined the meeting and, when asked if they would serve in a coalition, they said they must first consult their party's National Executive Committee, who were then in Bournemouth preparing for the annual party conference that was to start the following Monday. Even so, they indicated that it was unlikely they could serve in a government led by Chamberlain; they probably would be able to serve under another Conservative. They agreed to telephone on Friday afternoon with the result of their consultation. Earlier on Thursday, Chamberlain had met Halifax alone and had tried to persuade him to be his successor. Halifax would probably have been the Conservative Party's preferred candidate. Halifax replied that, as a peer and not therefore a member of the Commons, he would be seriously disadvantaged as Prime Minister and would have to delegate direction of the war effort to Churchill in the Commons. He did not change his position when the same question arose at the evening meeting in which Chamberlain and Halifax were joined by Churchill and the party's Chief Whip, David Margesson. Churchill's own account of these events, written six years later, is not accurate. It describes the events of 9 May as taking place the following day, and the description of Chamberlain attempting to persuade him to agree tacitly to Halifax's appointment as Prime Minister does not tally with Halifax having expressed his reluctance to do so at the morning meeting with Chamberlain. Arthur Greenwood () The Wehrmacht launched its blitzkrieg against western Europe on the morning of Friday, 10 May, by invading Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Given this new crisis, Chamberlain at first declared that he would not resign but he decided after all to await the Labour Party's decision, which he did not receive until late afternoon. Attlee telephoned Downing Street at about 4:45 pm to confirm that Labour would join a coalition government, but not under Chamberlain's leadership. Accordingly, Chamberlain went to Buckingham Palace where he had an audience with George VI at 6:00 pm. He tendered his resignation and, after the King asked him who should be his successor, recommended Churchill. The King sent for Churchill who agreed to form a coalition government and the public announcement was made by Chamberlain on BBC Radio at 9:00 pm. On Saturday, 11 May, the Labour Party agreed to join the national government under Churchill's leadership and he was able to form his war cabinet which, at the outset, was restricted to five members including himself as Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. Attlee relinquished his official role as Leader of the Opposition to become Lord Privy Seal (until 19 February 1942 when he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister) and Greenwood was appointed a Minister without Portfolio. The main problem for Churchill as he became Prime Minister was that he was not the leader of the Conservative Party and so he was obliged to include Chamberlain in the war cabinet, as Lord President of the Council, and to retain Halifax as Foreign Secretary. The war cabinet was augmented by the three service ministers who attended most of its meetings and these were Churchill appointees on whose support he could generally rely. Anthony Eden became Secretary of State for War, Labour's A. V. Alexander succeeded Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty and the leader of the Liberal Party, Sir Archibald Sinclair, became Secretary of State for Air. =War situation to Friday, 24 May= Lord Gort (gesturing, at centre) was the commander-in-chief of the BEF. By the 21 May, German tanks were approaching Boulogne-sur-Mer. John Colville in his diary entry that day said preparations for the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) were being made in case of necessity. An estimated 400,000 Allied servicemen, mostly of the BEF with elements of the French First Army, had retreated into the coastal area. Their hopes rested mostly on the success of the Weygand Plan, a proposed counter-offensive by themselves in conjunction with a strike from the south by the main French forces. This did not come to fruition and the BEF commander, Lord Gort, decided that evacuation was the only option. During 23 and 24 May, the Royal Navy evacuated an estimated 4,365 servicemen from Boulogne. At a war cabinet meeting on the morning of Friday the 24th, Churchill reported that there were large numbers of French troops in Dunkirk but as yet no British servicemen other than a few specialist units. He had been advised that the port was functioning well with supplies being unloaded. There was a proposal to send Canadian troops to Dunkirk but this was pending developments in the wider theatre. The war cabinet's interest in Italy on 24 May was limited to keeping it out of the war, or at least delaying its entry. Halifax presented a telegram from the French government which suggested an approach to the Italian dictator Mussolini by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, assuming he was willing to co-operate, for the purpose of enquiring what Mussolini's grievances were in order to have these discussed by all concerned before any resort to military action. Halifax was not confident that anything would come of the French idea but he said he would support it on condition that the approach was presented to Mussolini as a personal initiative by Roosevelt. On the morning of 24 May, Hitler, having consulted General von Rundstedt, ordered the Panzers to halt their advance. This has been seen as one of the key decisions of the war as it gave the British extra time that they desperately needed to evacuate their servicemen from Dunkirk. Some of the German commanders disagreed with it and, a week later, General von Bock wrote in his diary that \\"when we do finally reach Dunkirk, the English will all be gone\\". =Events of Saturday, 25 May= The war cabinet met in Downing Street at 11:30 am. Halifax confirmed that he had replied to the French government about their idea of persuading Roosevelt to approach Mussolini. Halifax also reported on a discussion between Sir Robert Vansittart and an unnamed Italian diplomat, although he understood the approach to be unofficial. Boulogne surrendered on the afternoon of 25 May and the 10th Panzer Division led the German attack on Calais with support from the Luftwaffe. Dunkirk was the only available port for evacuation. With the BEF and its allies in retreat and Lord Gort warning them of impending disaster, the war cabinet had to consider the consequences of French defeat. Gort predicted the loss of all equipment and doubted that more than a small percentage of servicemen could be evacuated. Giuseppe Bastianini, Italian ambassador to London The war cabinet had already commissioned a report called British Strategy in a Certain Eventuality, drafted by the Chiefs of Staff (CoS). The report concluded that resistance to the Wehrmacht would be impossible if they gained a secure foothold in Britain: without the bulk of the army stranded in France, the home-based forces and civil defence would be inadequate. The CoS held that air defence was crucial and that teh United Kingdom could not survive if Germany gained control of the air, although the Royal Navy would at least provide some breathing space. It had been calculated that Germany's air superiority was about four to one and it was vital that the British war effort must concentrate primarily on the production of fighter aircraft and crews, and the defence of those factories essential to fighter production should have priority. The report had two main conclusions. One was that the United Kingdom could probably resist invasion if the RAF and the Royal Navy remained intact and this became a key point in Churchill's argument, against Halifax, that the country should fight on without negotiation. The other was that, ultimately, Britain could not hope to win the war without American assistance. Late in the afternoon of 25 May, Halifax met Giuseppe Bastianini, the Italian ambassador to the UK. Halifax sent an account of the meeting to the British Ambassador in Rome, Sir Percy Loraine. It included a statement by Halifax that \\"matters which cause anxiety to Italy must certainly be discussed as part of the general European settlement\\". This was presented to the war cabinet next day. At this stage, France and Britain wanted to keep Italy out of the war, but Halifax wanted to use Mussolini as a mediator to secure a peace that would, while giving Hitler almost complete control of continental Europe, ensure the autonomy and security of Great Britain and its empire. In his biography of Churchill, Roy Jenkins says this would have been the equivalent of a second Munich twenty months after the first. In Jenkins' opinion, Halifax thought of himself as a realist but, in reality, his views chimed with his profound Christian pessimism. The key factor was that this negative outlook deprived him of Churchill's indomitable courage. Jenkins says Halifax was probably content to have England left alone, in the same way as Spain or Switzerland or Sweden. He could not understand that such a prospect was repugnant to Churchill and so conflict between the two was inevitable. At 10:00 pm, Churchill chaired a defence committee meeting at Admiralty House in which he directed that a war cabinet meeting should be held at 9:00 am the next morning. The minutes of the defence committee meeting included an order to Gort that he should march north to the coast (i.e., to Dunkirk) in battle order and to strike at all forces between himself and the sea with the assistance of General Georges Blanchard, commander of the French First Army, and the Belgians. Churchill also decreed that a plan (Operation Dynamo) should be formulated by the Royal Navy to prepare all possible means of re-embarkation from the ports and beaches. The RAF were directed to dominate the air above the area involved. War cabinet meetings ‚Äì 26 to 28 May Over these three days, seven top secret ministerial meetings (including two that were adjourned and reconvened) were held at Downing Street, Admiralty House or in the Prime Minister's office at the House of Commons. In the meetings, the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Edward Bridges was always present when minutes were to be taken. He was sometimes assisted by other civil servants or military experts. Minutes from all war cabinet meetings in May and June are held in The National Archives. The war cabinet and service ministers were usually joined by the CoS who were Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord; Air Marshal Sir Cyril Newall, the Chief of the Air Staff; and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS). The office of CIGS changed hands on 27 May when, as desired by Churchill, Field Marshal Sir Edmund Ironside was replaced by his deputy Field Marshal Sir John Dill. Ironside became Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces. Others who often took part included the Home Secretary, Sir John Anderson; the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Alexander Cadogan; the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Viscount Caldecote; and the Minister of Information, Duff Cooper. At this stage of the war, Churchill's position as Prime Minister was still precarious. Chamberlain remained the leader of the Conservative Party which had a massive Commons majority and Halifax was, almost certainly, the preferred establishment choice to be Chamberlain's successor. Churchill could not, therefore, afford to have both Chamberlain and Halifax aligned against him. Given that the other two members of the war cabinet were long- time political opponents from the Labour Party, Churchill was by no means certain of an adequate majority within his own cabinet. Attlee became a more or less silent supporter who listened rather than spoke, but Greenwood asserted himself resolutely as a supporter of Churchill's fight on policy. Churchill therefore had a slender majority in the war cabinet, but so much depended on Chamberlain who was always somewhere between Churchill and Halifax. Churchill decided to invite Sinclair to attend the war cabinet after the Sunday meetings. His argument was that Sinclair as leader of the Liberal Party should have a say, but in fact Sinclair was an old friend on whose support he could rely. Even with a four to two majority around the table, Churchill could not risk both Chamberlain and Halifax resigning as that would bring the Conservative majority into the equation and, almost certainly, an appeasement government like the one that would soon surrender in France. He had to tread very carefully, therefore, until he could believe in Chamberlain's eventual resolve. =Sunday, 26 May= French premier Paul Reynaud visited London on 26 May. French premier Paul Reynaud was in London for much of Sunday and had a working lunch with Churchill between two war cabinet meetings, followed by a meeting with Halifax at about 3:15 pm. The war cabinet met at 9:00 am and 2:00 pm (both at Downing Street). The second one was adjourned so that, first, Halifax and then the rest of the war cabinet could meet Reynaud at Admiralty House. The war cabinet reconvened there at about 5:00 pm, following Reynaud's departure. First session Churchill opened the meeting by briefing his colleagues on the Saturday night defence committee meeting and informing them of Reynaud's visit later on Sunday. He explained that, because of communication difficulties, the French high command had not known of Gort's decision that the BEF must retreat to Dunkirk and await evacuation. Churchill said that General Maxime Weygand was now aware and had accepted the situation. Weygand had instructed Blanchard to use his own discretion in supporting the retreat and evacuation as there was no longer any possibility of making a counter-attack to the south, especially as the French First Army had lost all its heavy guns and armoured vehicles. Churchill anticipated the total collapse of France and feared that Reynaud was coming to London to confirm it. As a result, evacuation of the BEF was now the government's first priority and, hence, the conclusions reached on Saturday night and transmitted to Gort. Churchill remained optimistic and expressed an opinion that there was \\"a good chance of getting off a considerable proportion of the BEF\\" and that he would make every endeavour to persuade Reynaud to fight on. At this time, he did not know Reynaud's plans for the day and provisionally arranged another war cabinet meeting at 2:00 pm. Even so, in the interest of being prepared to meet all eventualities, Churchill had asked the Chiefs of Staff (CoS) to consider the situation which would arise if the French did surrender, on the following terms of reference: Sir Cyril Newall (a later photo, showing him as a Marshal of the Royal Air Force) Newall reminded the cabinet that the CoS had written British Strategy in a Certain Eventuality (paper no. CoS (40) 390), completed on the 25 May and now to be reviewed in the light of the new terms of reference set out by the Prime Minister. This was achieved by British Strategy in the Near Future (paper no. CoS (40) 397), completed late on 26 May and presented to the war cabinet the next day. It was supplemented by paper no. WCP (40) 171, written by Greenwood on the 26 May and discussing the economic aspects of the problem. There followed a brief discussion among the CoS about the defence of Calais and then, for the first time, Halifax raised the subject of Italian mediation by stating his opinion that \\"on the broader issue, we (the government) must face the fact that it is not so much now a question of imposing a complete defeat upon Germany but of safeguarding the independence of our own Empire and if possible that of France\\". He proceeded to give a report of his conversation with Bastianini who had requested a conference on the peace and security of Europe. According to Bastianini, it was Mussolini's principal wish to secure peace in Europe. Halifax had answered this by saying \\"we should naturally be prepared to consider any proposals which might lead to this, provided our liberty and independence were assured\\". He confirmed that the French had been informed of the Italian approach and that Bastianini had requested a second interview that day. Churchill replied that: Chamberlain predicted that Italy would soon issue an ultimatum to France and then come in on Germany's side. Attlee pointed out that Mussolini would be very nervous of Germany emerging as the predominant power in Europe. Halifax was convinced that Great Britain was not strong enough to face Hitler alone, given that France was about to capitulate and there was no prospect of help from America. Sir Dudley Pound Soon after this, an aide-memoire (paper no. CoS (40) 391) was distributed by the CoS. Entitled Visit of M. Reynaud on 26th May, 1940 and signed jointly by Ironside, Newall and Pound, it anticipated the eventuality that Reynaud would announce the intention of France to make a separate peace. It firstly presented arguments to deter the French from capitulation and stressed that even if the French had decided to capitulate, \\"we shall continue the fight single-handed\\". It went on to promise drastic measures, including blockade and the bombing of French cities, to be taken against France if occupied by German forces. The most immediate recommendations were to demand French assistance in the evacuation of the BEF and the transfer of all French naval vessels and military aircraft to British ports and bases. There was only a single mention of Italy to the effect that it would certainly exploit the situation to its advantage and satisfy its claims against France. The war cabinet expressed several views on the content of the paper. Halifax displayed a lack of understanding when he said that Great Britain could not fight alone without first establishing and then maintaining complete air superiority over Germany. Newall corrected him as the report had not said that. Instead, it was necessary to prevent Germany from achieving complete air superiority as that would enable them to invade England. Sinclair doubted Germany's ability to maintain the oil supplies necessary for a prolonged air war. Newall told Halifax that his issue was out of scope as this memoire was focused on French capitulation. Strategic questions would be discussed in the second report for which Churchill had presented terms of reference earlier. The meeting ended with the war cabinet approving the instructions given to Gort by the defence committee that he should retreat to Dunkirk in full battle order. A fleet of ships and small boats would be assembled for the evacuation. The forces in Calais were to hold out for as long as possible. The CoS would prepare a supplement to their report, based on Churchill's terms of reference. Second session Sir Edmund Ironside was CIGS until 27 May. Apart from the docks, where a British contingent held on until the Monday morning, the town of Calais was taken by the Wehrmacht on Sunday afternoon. Although Calais was a hopeless defence, it nevertheless slowed the coastal advance of the 10th Panzer Division towards Dunkirk, to which the Allied forces were already retreating. The war cabinet resumed its deliberations at 2:00 pm. Churchill began by describing his lunchtime meeting with Reynaud, who had stated that the French military situation was desperate but that he had no intention of signing a separate peace treaty with Germany. The problem was that he might be forced to resign as he believed there were others in the French government, principally Marshal P√©tain, who would call for an armistice. Reynaud dismissed Churchill's fear that Germany would try for an early invasion of England and said they would strike for Paris, which they did as soon as they captured Dunkirk. Churchill told Reynaud that the United Kingdom was not prepared to give in on any account and would rather go down fighting than be enslaved to Germany. He added that he had confidence in the British armed forces to survive a German onslaught but, he warned, France must stay in the war. Reynaud confirmed that no terms had yet been offered by Germany. Having briefed the war cabinet on his own discussion with Reynaud, Churchill suggested that Halifax should go over to Admiralty House and meet Reynaud himself. The others would join them shortly. Before Halifax left, there was another brief discussion about Italy. Reynaud had told Churchill that he wanted to keep Italy out of the war so that ten French divisions on the Italian border could be released to fight the Germans. Reynaud was worried about the sort of terms Italy would require as France would certainly have to cede territory. Halifax said he believed an approach must be made to Italy. He had faith in Mussolini to persuade Hitler to take a more reasonable attitude. Churchill replied that he did not think anything would come of an approach to Mussolini, though he did agree that it was a matter for the war cabinet to discuss further. For the moment, Churchill's sole concern was that the French must provide as much assistance as possible in the evacuation of the BEF. Although it is not entirely clear from the minutes, it would seem that the Downing Street session ended now (probably before 3:00 pm) with, first, Halifax and later the other four members going to Admiralty House (a five- minute walk) to see Reynaud. Churchill had to treat Halifax carefully until he was more sure of Chamberlain's views. He could not risk a direct conflict with Halifax while his own position in the Conservative party was insecure, because Halifax had strong support in the party. Fortunately for Churchill, Chamberlain never trusted Mussolini and did not want him involved in any negotiations. Chamberlain's main concern through the three days was that the French must be mollified and encouraged to stay in the war, so he was very cautious about refusing any requests by Reynaud, even one he disagreed with. There is a view that Chamberlain had warmed to Churchill and wanted to support him, in spite of past antagonism over appeasement, because Churchill had treated him with great respect and affection since inviting him to join the war cabinet. Third session After Reynaud's departure, the war cabinet held another meeting in Admiralty House. The cabinet papers do not cover the first fifteen minutes as the Cabinet Secretary was not present to take minutes. The cabinet papers indicate that this session was in fact a continuation of the 2:00 pm one by including both under the same heading. It seems to have lasted about an hour from 5:00 pm till 6:00 pm as, in effect, the third Sunday meeting. The minutes confirm that the service ministers were not present. In the minutes, Churchill began by comparing the United Kingdom's military status with that of France. We, he said, still had powers of resistance and attack, which France did not. If France could not defend herself, he asserted, it was better that she should get out of the war rather than drag Great Britain into a settlement which involved intolerable terms. Attlee and Chamberlain both suggested that Hitler had a schedule and that he must win the war before winter. Attlee emphasised the importance of keeping France in the war so that Hitler could not turn on Britainin 1940. Sir Bertram Ramsay initiated Operation Dynamo. Churchill replied that he wanted France to hang on but stressed that the United Kingdom must not be forced into the weak position of seeking negotiation before engaging in any serious fighting. Halifax now openly disagreed with Churchill by saying that he attached \\"rather more importance than the Prime Minister to the desirability of allowing France to try out the possibilities of European equilibrium\\". He went on to say that it was important to reason with Mussolini about the balance of power in Europe and that Britain might then consider Italian claims. Greenwood pointed out that it was not within Mussolini's power to take a line independent of Hitler and Chamberlain added that Mussolini could only take an independent line if Hitler allowed him to do so. Chamberlain added that the problem was a difficult one and every point of view must be discussed. Having listened to Chamberlain, who was still somewhere between himself and Halifax, Churchill suggested that nothing should be decided about future conduct of the war, including any negotiated settlement, until the evacuation of the BEF from Dunkirk was completed. While he acknowledged that Operation Dynamo might fail, he was optimistic that a significant portion of the BEF would be saved, but much depended on air superiority. The war cabinet decided that Halifax must write, for discussion on Monday, the draft of a communication to Italy (this was circulated as paper no. WP (40) 170), together with a record of his latest meeting with Bastianini. It was also agreed, at Churchill's suggestion or insistence, that Sinclair should become a de facto member of the war cabinet ahead of future discussions about Italy. While Churchill may already have gained the support of the two Labour members, he needed Sinclair as Liberal Party leader to strengthen his position. Sometime after 6:00 pm, Churchill telephoned Vice-Admiral Ramsay in Dover to give the go-ahead for Dynamo to begin. At 6:57 pm, Ramsay sent the signal which initiated Dynamo, though with evacuation in some form already having taken place over the last four days, it is difficult to differentiate between the work of Dynamo and the work that preceded it. =Monday, 27 May= The Calais docks finally fell on the morning of Monday the 27th. Throughout the day, a total of 7,669 servicemen were evacuated from Dunkirk harbour but none as yet from the beaches. The war cabinet held three meetings at 11:30 am, 4:30 pm and 10:00 pm. 11:30 am meeting The minutes from the 11:30 am meeting are the longest taken at any of the war cabinet meetings between 24 and 29 May (there are 28 pages in one volume and seven in the other). Even so, there is no mention at all of negotiations with Italy. The meeting was mostly about military strategy and Halifax was only involved in questions about Belgium, Iceland, the USA and the USSR. Mussolini is briefly mentioned once in the context of when he might declare war on Great Britain and France. An issue had been raised by Stanley Bruce, the Australian High Commissioner, and Chamberlain had told Bruce (whom the war cabinet considered a defeatist) that he expected Mussolini to intervene as soon as Paris fell (in fact, Mussolini's declaration came on 10 June, four days before Paris was taken). 4:30 pm meeting Italy was the key subject under discussion at the 4:30 pm meeting when the war cabinet discussed a memorandum prepared by Halifax to propose an approach to Mussolini. Those present were the five war cabinet members with Sinclair, Cadogan and Bridges. The memorandum was drafted in response to Reynaud's visit in which he asked the British government to join him in making an approach to Mussolini. The suggested terms, broadly, were that Mussolini must be advised of the situation he would face if Germany established domination of Europe and that the allies would include Italy in settlement of all European issues, especially any geographical questions in which Mussolini was primarily interested. The memo went on to recommend an initiative by Roosevelt, to be jointly requested by Great Britain and France, in which he would seek to involve Italian participation in a peace conference with a view to understanding Italian issues and seeking to resolve them. Halifax was forced to add that since drafting the memorandum he had been advised by the British ambassador in Rome of Mussolini's resentment towards Roosevelt's earlier communication, deriding it as an unwarranted interference in Italy's affairs. Churchill began the discussion by saying that there was an enormous difference between a direct approach to Mussolini and an indirect one via Roosevelt, even if ostensibly on his own initiative. Chamberlain spoke at length about the pros and cons but concluded that the French plan would serve no useful purpose as he expected Italy to join the war in any event so that, as he put it, Mussolini would get a share of the spoils. Sinclair now spoke and said he completely opposed any direct approach to Mussolini but would await the result of Roosevelt's intervention. His concern was the damage to national morale that would be caused if the government did anything that could be perceived as weakness. Attlee agreed with him and added that Mussolini would never be satisfied with anything offered to him and would at once ask for more. Greenwood went further, saying that he had given up hope of France getting out of its difficulty. Given the progress being made by Germany, there would not be time to complete any negotiations before France fell. Greenwood insisted that it would be disastrous to approach Mussolini. Churchill spoke again and firmly dismissed an approach to Mussolini as futile, dangerous and ruinous to the integrity of Britain's fighting position. Reynaud, he said, would be best advised to make a firm stand. Churchill asserted that Britain must not be dragged down the slippery slope with France. The best help that Britain could give to France was to assure them that, whatever happened, Britain was going to fight it out to the end. He was concerned about the country's loss of prestige and said the only way to recover it was by showing the world that Germany had not won the war. If the worst came to the worst, he concluded, it would not be a bad thing for this country to go down fighting for the other countries which had been overcome by Nazi tyranny. Chamberlain did not agree with the French proposal but he suggested that an outright refusal might not be wise while efforts were being made to persuade France to fight on. In any case, he added, for Britain and France to \\"barge in on our own\\" after getting Roosevelt involved would probably alienate Roosevelt. Halifax agreed with Chamberlain and said he was completely in favour of getting France to fight on to the end, but he resented the suggestion that his approach amounted to suing for peace. He challenged Churchill on his apparent change of mind during the last 24 hours. On Sunday, Halifax had understood Churchill to say he was prepared to discuss any offer of terms but, today, Churchill was defiantly saying that no course was open except fighting to a finish. Halifax accepted that the point was probably academic, because he did not believe any acceptable offer would come from Hitler, but while it was still possible to obtain an acceptable settlement, he could not agree with Churchill's stated intention. Churchill said he would not join France in requesting terms but that he would consider any offer they received. Chamberlain said there would be no difficulty in deciding if an offer should be considered or not. Greenwood asked Halifax if he thought a French approach to Mussolini would prevent French capitulation and Halifax agreed it would not, but he still did not want the British government to send a flat refusal to Reynaud. He recommended the line suggested by Chamberlain and, after some further discussion on that point, it was agreed that Churchill should tell Reynaud to await the outcome of Roosevelt's initiative. By all accounts except the minutes, this was a stormy meeting. Antony Beevor suggests that it \\"perhaps encapsulated the most critical moment of the war, when Nazi Germany might have won\\". The clash between Churchill and Halifax was now open and Halifax threatened to resign if his views were ignored. Churchill had the full support of Attlee, Greenwood and Sinclair. He had convinced Chamberlain that it was pointless to negotiate but Chamberlain remained cautious about how to reply to Reynaud and Churchill, unlike Greenwood for one, would not oppose Chamberlain about that. Later on, Churchill spoke to Halifax in the garden at 10, Downing Street and managed to calm him. 10:00 pm meeting General Sir John Dill became CIGS on 27 May. The war cabinet met again at 10:00 pm with the Chiefs of Staff in attendance. They included General Sir John Dill, who had just replaced Ironside as CIGS. This was a short meeting called to discuss events on the Western Front. The main issue was the intended surrender of Belgium from midnight that night. Weygand, with Churchill's support, had asked the French government to dissociate themselves from the Belgians and order Blanchard and Gort to fight on. Also in attendance was Duff Cooper, the Minister of Information, who needed the war cabinet's advice on what to tell the public about the fall of Calais, the Belgian capitulation and the seriousness of the BEF position as they retreated to Dunkirk. Churchill wanted the seriousness to be emphasised but, for the sake of relatives, was against the publication of details (e.g., the names of regiments in Calais). He forbade any speculation about the outcome of Operation Dynamo until it became clear if it would succeed or fail. Churchill also said that he personally needed to make a full statement in Parliament but thought it might be another week before the situation had cleared sufficiently to enable him to do so. The war cabinet agreed that Cooper should proceed along the lines suggested by Churchill. Diaries In his diary entry for this day, Colville wrote that the Cabinet was \\"feverishly\\" considering the country's ability to continue fighting the war alone given that the fall of France seemed imminent and the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was necessary. In his sole reference to confrontation between Churchill and Halifax, he wrote: \\"there are signs that Halifax is being defeatist\\". Halifax believed that Great Britain could no longer crush Germany and must rather preserve its own integrity and independence. Cadogan, who was present at many of the war cabinet meetings, was also a prolific diarist. He wrote that Halifax was considering resignation after the 4:30 meeting, though Churchill had afterwards persuaded him to think again. Cadogan had sensed a difference of opinion arising between Chamberlain and Halifax. In a later entry, Cadogan expressed a hope that \\"we shan't delude ourselves into thinking we can do any good by making more offers or approaches\\". David Owen comments that this was a very different view to that of Cadogan's boss, Halifax, and much closer to that of Chamberlain who, as the minutes show, could see no practical use in an approach to Italy but was worried about upsetting the French. In his own diary entry for the day, Halifax confirmed that he had seriously thought of resigning and had said so in the 4:30 meeting. He claimed that Churchill and Greenwood had \\"talked the most frightful rot\\" about the proposed approach to Italy. =Tuesday, 28 May= Throughout the day, a total of 11,874 servicemen were evacuated from Dunkirk harbour and 5,930 from the beaches. The war cabinet held meetings at 11:30 am and 4:00 pm. The second meeting was adjourned at 6:15 pm so that Churchill could address the outer cabinet of 25 members and explain to them the war situation and prospects. The war cabinet reconvened at 7:00 pm for a short time. First meeting (11:30 am) This was attended by the service ministers and chiefs of staff along with Anderson, Caldecote and Cooper. The first item on the agenda was Belgium and there were two guests, Admiral Sir Roger Keyes and Lieutenant-Colonel G. M. O. Davy, who had both just returned from Belgium. They presented their views on the political and military situation in Belgium and then left the meeting. There followed a discussion on the western front and the progress of Operation Dynamo. The war cabinet directed Cooper to make a statement on BBC Radio at 1:00 pm, telling the public that the BEF was fighting its way back to the coast with the full assistance of the RAF and the Royal Navy. It was agreed that Churchill would make a similar statement in the Commons later in the afternoon. The next two items on the agenda were a report by the Chief of the Air Staff and a discussion about operations in Norway. The war cabinet then considered the Italian situation and a telegram from Washington which reported that Mussolini's response to Roosevelt had been \\"entirely negative\\". In Roosevelt's opinion, Mussolini would not take any military action during the next few days. The war cabinet decided to answer the French proposal in terms of awaiting developments, as Chamberlain had suggested the previous evening. The meeting continued with questions about home security, naval operations and the protection of munition and aircraft factories. There was also a concern about subversive newspapers and the war cabinet agreed that a defence regulation must be introduced to prohibit printing and publication of subversive matter. \\"Hard and heavy tidings\\" Churchill went to the Commons and made a brief statement on the Western Front. He confirmed the capitulation of the Belgian army at 4:00 that morning but pointed out the intention of the Belgian government in exile to fight on. Churchill stressed that the British and French armies were fighting on and that they were receiving powerful assistance from the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy. For security reasons, he would give no details of strategy or operations but hoped to say more next week. He concluded by saying: In response, the acting Leader of the Opposition, Hastings Lees-Smith, thanked him for his statement and pointed out that \\"we have not yet touched the fringe of the resolution of this country\\". In a brief comment before the session closed, Sir Percy Harris for the Liberals emphasised that Churchill's words reflected \\"not only the feeling of the whole House but the feeling of the whole nation\\". Second meeting (4:00 pm) Attendance was limited to the five war cabinet members with Sinclair, Cadogan and Bridges. As stated in the opening paragraph of the minutes, the meeting was summoned to consider a message received from the French Government again proposing that a direct approach should be made to Italy by France and Great Britain. The argument between Churchill and Halifax began again almost immediately, but this time Churchill was not at all conciliatory. He took a much more resolute line than previously against any form of negotiation. Halifax told his colleagues about another enquiry made by the Italian embassy in London. The request was that the British government should give a clear indication that they favoured mediation by Italy. Churchill countered by saying that it was the French purpose to have Mussolini mediating between Britain and Hitler, an unacceptable scenario. Halifax said it depended on being able to secure British independence as Britain could then make certain concessions to Italy. Churchill again used his slippery slope analogy in regard to the French and pointed out that things would be different after Germany had tried and failed to invade England. Chamberlain now supported Churchill by stating that there could be no question of concessions being made to Italy while the war continued. Any concessions which might ever be necessary must be part of a general settlement with Germany, not with Italy. He doubted in any case if Mussolini wanted to come into the war yet and, as Greenwood had argued, Hitler might not want him to declare war at all. Halifax stuck to his guns and said that Britain might get better terms before France capitulated than later in the year after Britain's aircraft factories had been bombed. That led to a discussion about defences against night-time bombing. Churchill then returned to the subject of the French request for mediation by Mussolini. In his view, Reynaud wanted the British to meet Hitler. If that happened, the terms would be unacceptable and, he said, on leaving the conference Britain should find that all the forces of resolution that were now at its disposal would have vanished. It was clear, he concluded, that Reynaud only wanted to end the war. Chamberlain agreed with Churchill's diagnosis, but he wanted to keep France in the war as long as possible and urged caution in the British reply to Reynaud. He suggested, with general approval, that Reynaud should be told the present was not the time to make an approach to Mussolini and that France and Britain would fare better in the future if both continued the struggle. Halifax reminded everyone that Reynaud had also wanted the Allies to address an appeal to Roosevelt. Churchill had no objection to such an appeal but Greenwood accused Reynaud of \\"hawking\\" appeals around, this being yet another attempt to get out of the war. Chamberlain thought Reynaud wanted Roosevelt involved as a counterpoint to Mussolini at a peace conference. Churchill picked up Greenwood's argument and added that, while Reynaud wanted out of the war, he did not want to breach the Allied treaty obligations. If Mussolini became a mediator, he would want \\"his whack out of us\\" and Hitler would hardly be so foolish as to let British rearmament continue. He reasserted that Hitler's terms now would be no worse than if Great Britain fought on and was beaten. He reminded his colleagues that a continuation of the conflict would see severe losses inflicted on Germany also. Even so, Halifax said he still could not see what was so wrong in trying out the possibilities of mediation, but then Chamberlain said he did not see what could be lost by deciding to fight on to the end. While the government might, dispassionately, be prepared to consider any \\"decent terms\\" offered, Chamberlain asserted that the alternative to fighting on nevertheless involved a considerable gamble. The minutes confirm the war cabinet's agreement with Chamberlain's comment as \\"a true statement of the case\\". Churchill declared that the nations which went down fighting rose again, but those which surrendered tamely were finished. He added his view that the chances of decent terms being offered were a thousand to one against. Chamberlain called for a realistic assessment of the situation. Although, in principle, Halifax was right to say that Britain should consider decent terms in the unlikely event that they were offered, but he did not believe that an approach to Mussolini would produce such an offer. He again urged caution when replying to Reynaud in case France capitulated immediately and it would be unwise to give them any pretext for doing so. The key to the current problem was phrasing the reply so that France would not see it as a complete rejection of their proposal, only that now was not the right time to be doing it. The war cabinet expressed general agreement with his views. Attlee now spoke and pointed out the necessity of recognising British public opinion. He advised that, while the war cabinet had been able to watch the situation gradually unfold, the public would sustain a severe shock when they realised the dangerous position of the BEF. It was necessary to raise and maintain public morale, but that would be impossible if the government did what France wanted. Greenwood agreed with him and pointed out that people in the industrial areas would regard any sign of government weakness as a disaster. General agreement was expressed with Chamberlain's views about how to reply to Reynaud, although Sinclair suggested that Churchill should exhort Reynaud and Weygand to fight on. The war cabinet decided against the proposed appeal to Roosevelt, which they considered premature. Halifax suggested drafting a broadcast for Churchill to speak to the Dominions and Churchill said he would be happy to consider it, but that he should not broadcast at the present time. It was by now 6:15 pm and the war cabinet agreed to adjourn so that Chamberlain and Halifax could prepare a draft of the reply to Reynaud. Churchill, meanwhile, wished to address the members of his outer cabinet. Churchill meets with the outer cabinet (6:15 pm) As the war cabinet adjourned, it was now clear that Halifax was in a minority of one given the view expressed by Chamberlain about the alternative to fighting on. Nevertheless, Halifax still held a powerful position within the Conservative party, even without Chamberlain's support, and Churchill still needed the approval of the outer cabinet for his policy of fighting on, alone if necessary. He began by telling the 25 ministers that Great Britain was going to fight and was not going to negotiate. Hugh Dalton, who was the Minister of Economic Warfare, recalled Churchill saying, as he had done in the war cabinet meeting, that Britain should not get better terms from Germany now than if she fought it out. Germany's terms, he said would include a demand for the fleet and Great Britain would become a puppet state \\"under Mosley or some such person\\". Churchill went on to a dramatic and defiant conclusion by reportedly saying that \\"if this long island story of ours is to end at last, let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground\\". Dalton recalled that there was unanimous approval round the table and not even the faintest flicker of dissent. Several ministers patted Churchill on the shoulder as they were leaving. Leo Amery, recently appointed Secretary of State for India, wrote that the meeting \\"left all of us tremendously heartened by Winston's resolution and grip of things\\". As Beevor put it, Halifax had been decisively out-manoeuvred and Great Britain would fight on to the end. Max Hastings pointed out how much Churchill relied on the eventual support of Chamberlain as leader of the Conservative Party: this was critical in deflecting Halifax's proposals. Hastings outlines Churchill's dilemma faced with the prospect of Halifax, the man widely considered to have majority support in the Conservative Party, quitting his government just at the moment of supreme crisis when Operation Dynamo was barely underway. Great Britain at that time, perhaps more so than at any other time in history, needed to present a united face to the world. It may be argued that Churchill should have let Halifax go, but he could not do that because he needed the support of the huge Conservative majority in the Commons and, although he could never again have confidence in Halifax as a colleague, he was obliged to endure him for another seven months in order to be sure of retaining Conservative support. It was not until December, a month after he succeeded Chamberlain as Tory leader, that Churchill finally felt able to consign Halifax to exile in Washington. There is a legend, as Hastings says, of a united Britain in the summer months of 1940 which stood firm against Hitler and, eventually, having formed the key alliances with the US and the USSR, defeated him. That was a reality and it would all have been different if another man had been prime minister. If the political faction seeking a negotiated peace had prevailed then Britain, crucially, would have been out of the war. Hitler might then have won the war. In May 1940, Churchill understood that even the mere gesture of considering peace terms would have a disastrous impact on the country and his policy of fighting on would have been irretrievably compromised. War cabinet reconvenes (7:00 pm) This session lasted only twenty minutes. Churchill began by describing the response of the outer cabinet to the latest news. As the minutes recorded it: Churchill went on to read out a letter which he had received from General Edward Spears in Paris. This confirmed the support of Weygand for the retreat by Gort and Blanchard to the Channel coast. Chamberlain read the draft reply which he and Halifax had prepared during the interim, explaining that they were not merely presenting a British point of view as the purpose of the message was to persuade Reynaud that it was in France's interest to go on fighting. Churchill said he was happy with the draft and Halifax was authorised to despatch it to Reynaud. Jenkins says that Halifax at this point had recognised that he was beaten, largely because he could not overcome Churchill's resolve but crucially, perhaps, because he could see that Chamberlain had moved away from him and was firmly on Churchill's side. With the Mussolini option firmly rejected, the war cabinet turned to the remaining mediation question of an approach to the United States and Halifax showed them a telegram received from General Jan Smuts in South Africa, which effectively endorsed a message received earlier from Sir Robert Menzies in Australia. The gist of it was that the Dominions wanted to tell the US government that they were going to fight on even if they had to do it alone. They wanted nothing for themselves and were only concerned with the defence of world liberty against Nazi domination. The question for America was would they help or would they stand aside and take no action in defence of the rights of man? Halifax suggested that the government should seek the opinion of the British ambassador in Washington about whether a message on the lines of Smuts' proposal would change American public opinion. Churchill was reticent about this and said he thought that any appeal to America in the present situation would be premature. He said the best way to command respect from the American people was by making a bold stand against Hitler. The war cabinet concluded the meeting by agreeing that the French proposal of an approach to Mussolini was pointless and would serve no useful purpose, though it was important that their reply should show respect to the French and make clear that they were considering the problem from both the French and British points of view. Halifax was authorised to reply to Reynaud on the lines of the draft which he and Chamberlain had prepared. The war cabinet further concluded that any approach to America for help must be on the lines suggested by Smuts rather than by Reynaud. It was agreed that Halifax should communicate with the embassy in Washington to seek their views about the wisdom of any such approach. When the British communiqu√© arrived in Paris, General Spears was with Reynaud, who had been under pressure from the defeatists in his own cabinet to approach Mussolini. Spears said that Churchill's resolve had \\"a magical effect\\" on Reynaud who immediately vetoed any further communication with Italy and resolved to fight on. Later events There was a lengthy war cabinet meeting in Downing Street at 11:30 am on Wednesday, 29 May. It was essentially about military matters and attended by service ministers, chiefs of staff and a number of additional ministers. Churchill's stance on negotiation was fully vindicated when Halifax had to report a communication he had received from Sir Percy Loraine, the ambassador in Rome. In a meeting with Count Ciano, Italy's Foreign Minister, Loraine was told that Italian entry into the war was now certain with only the date to be decided. Ciano also said Mussolini would not listen to any overtures from France, even if they offered their Mediterranean territories to Italy. The war cabinet noted all of this and began to put into effect plans to detain or deport Italian citizens living in Great Britain. There were over 18,000 in total and at least 1,000 were listed as potentially dangerous. British troops evacuating Dunkirk's beaches. After the encouraging number of 17,000-plus evacuated from Dunkirk on the critical day of Tuesday, the 28th, there was by comparison a flood of about 50,000 per day on the Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday (29 May to 1 June). Operation Dynamo ended on Tuesday, 4 June when the French rearguard surrendered. An estimated 338,226 servicemen were evacuated, but virtually all their equipment and supplies were lost. The total was far in excess of expectations and it gave rise to a popular view that Dunkirk had been a miracle, and even a victory. Churchill himself referred to \\"a miracle of deliverance\\" in his \\"We shall fight on the beaches\\" speech to the Commons that afternoon. Even so, he shortly reminded everyone that: \\"We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations\\". The Germans shifted their attention southwards and initiated Fall Rot on 5 June, the day after Dunkirk fell. Mussolini finally made his expected declaration of war on the 10th, prompting Churchill to predict that travellers would no longer have to go all the way to Pompeii to see Italian ruins. The Wehrmacht occupied Paris on the 14th and completed their conquest of France on 25 June. Chamberlain resigned from the war cabinet on 29 September 1940 for health reasons as he had cancer of the colon. He died on 9 November. Churchill was elected to succeed him as leader of the Conservative Party and that removed any doubts about his position as prime minister where his own party was concerned. On 12 December, the British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, died suddenly. Churchill had already made some changes to the war cabinet by bringing in Sir John Anderson, Lord Beaverbrook, Ernest Bevin and Sir Kingsley Wood. He now decided to remove Halifax and appointed Anthony Eden to replace him as Foreign Secretary. Halifax was offered the Washington placement which he was obliged, in the circumstances, to accept. He held the role until 1 May 1946. Jenkins says he was successful, after a hesitant start. Jenkins concludes his coverage of the cabinet crisis with reference to Churchill's memoirs, written in 1948, in which he \\"breathtakingly\\" declared that the question of whether to fight on or not \\"never found a place in the war cabinet agenda\\".

Straggled along the head of a long sea loch between Arivruach and Laxay, it developed due to a mixture of crofting along the loch shore and fishing. It sits at the head of Loch Erisort. Those on the loch side were each given direct access to the loch for their boats as well as access to the moorland behind for their sheep. They also attended to their croft, given relative shelter from the elements by the high ground to the west. The village formerly had a police house, and currently houses a post office.

Their grammatical range can indicate various meanings and functions, such as speaker affect and assertiveness. Orthography and diction Japanese particles are written in hiragana in modern Japanese, though some of them also have kanji forms ( or for te ; for ni ; or for o ; and for wa ). Particles follow the same rules of phonetic transcription as all Japanese words, with the exception of (written ha, pronounced wa as a particle), (written he, pronounced e) and (written using a hiragana character with no other use in modern Japanese, originally assigned as wo, now usually pronounced o, though some speakers render it as wo). These exceptions are a relic of historical kana usage.  Types of particles  There are eight types of particles, depending on what function they serve. = = : : ga, no, wo, ni, he, to, de, kara, yori = = : :ka, no, ya, ni, to, yara, nari, dano = = : :ka, no, ya, na, wa, tomo, kashira = = : : sa, yo, ne = = : : bakari, made, dake, hodo, kurai, nado, nari, yara = = : : wa, mo, koso, demo, shika, sae, dani = = : : ba, ya, ga, te, noni, node, kara, tokoroga, keredomo = = : :no, kara Note that some particles appear in two types. For example, kara is a \\"case marker\\" where it describes where something is from or what happens after something; when it describes a cause it is a \\"conjunctive particle\\".

Their uses are mutually exclusive. Ni, when used to show location, is used only with stative verbs such as iru, \\"to be, exist;\\" aru, \\"to be, exist, have;\\" and sumu, \\"to live, inhabit.\\" * (Nihon-ni sunde iru. \\"I live in Japan.\\") * (Gakk≈ç-ni iru. \\"I am in school.\\") De is used with action verbs to convey the place of action, as opposed to location of being. * (Gakk≈ç-de neru. \\"I sleep in/at school.\\") ***Gakk≈ç-ni neru. *\\"I sleep to school,\\" is not usually used. = „Å´ ni and „Å∏ e = Ni and e can both indicate direction of motion, literally meaning \\"to\\" or \\"at\\" in English. However, as particles in Japanese directly modify the preceding noun, some Japanese language courses call this the \\"goal of movement\\" usage because it marks the goal of the movement. For example, in the sentence (Watashi wa uchi ni kaerimasu or \\"I'm going back home\\") the goal of the movement is home (uchi ni). In this sense, e is perhaps closer to English \\"towards\\" in terms of use (see example below). As long as ni is used directionally, it is possible to substitute e in its place. Ni used in other senses cannot be replaced by e: * (Gakk≈ç ni iku. \\"I'm going to school\\"), where gakk≈ç, \\"school,\\" is the destination of iku, \\"go.\\" **Gakk≈ç e iku. \\"I'm going to school,\\" where gakk≈ç, \\"school,\\" is the destination of iku, \\"go.\\" * (Gakk≈ç ni iru. \\"I'm at school\\"), where gakk≈ç, \\"school,\\" is the location of iru, \\"be;\\" not a destination. **Gakk≈ç e iru. *\\"I'm to school,\\" is not a possible construction since \\"be\\" is not a verb of motion. * (Tomodachi ni au \\"I'll meet my friends\\") where tomodachi, \\"friends,\\" is the indirect object of au, \\"meet;\\" not a destination. **Tomodachi e au *\\"I'll meet to my friends,\\" which is impossible because \\"meet\\" is not a verb of motion. * (Hon o kai ni itta \\"I went to buy a book\\"), where kai ni, \\"to buy,\\" shows purpose or intent, and is a verbal adverb; not destination. **Hon o kai e itta *\\"I went towards buying a book,\\" is not possible because kai, \\"buying,\\" cannot be a destination. Indicating direction, using e instead of ni is preferred when ni is used non-directionally in proximity: * (Tomodachi ni ai ni Ky≈çto e itta. \\"I went to Kyoto to meet my friends.\\") Ni can not be replaced by e in all uses. It must be used with days of the week as in (Nichiyoubi ni Kyoto ni ikimasu \\"I will go to Kyoto on Sunday\\".) where ni is used both to mark the day of the week (Êó•ÊõúÊó•) and the goal of the movement (‰∫¨ÈÉΩ). It is also required with numerical times (but not relative times). For example, ni must be used in the sentence (Juu ichi ji ni nemasu \\"I will go to sleep at 11 o'clock\\") to mark the numerical time (ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÊôÇ) but it is not used with the relative time words like tomorrow (ÊòéÊó•), yesterday (Êò®Êó•), today (‰ªäÊó•), last week (ÂÖàÈÄ±), next month (Êù•Êúà), etc. For example, in the sentence (watashi wa kinou shigoto ni ikimasen deshita \\"I did not go to work yesterday\\") no particle is needed for \\"yesterday\\" (Êò®Êó•), but ni is used to mark the goal of movement (‰ªï‰∫ã„Å´). =„Åå ga and „Çí o= In some cases, ga and o are interchangeable. For example, with the tai form, meaning \\"want to\\", it is possible to say either of the following: * (Gohan ga tabetai. \\"I want to eat rice.\\") * (Gohan o tabetai. \\"I want to eat rice.\\") Similarly, Â•Ω„Åç suki, a na adjective meaning \\"liked\\", can take either ga or o: * (Kimi ga suki da \\"I like you\\") * (Kimi o suki de yokatta \\"I'm glad I like you\\") (words from a popular song) =„Å´ ni and „Å® to= Ni and to are sometimes interchangeable in forms like ni naru and to naru. The ni naru form suggests a natural change, whereas to naru suggests change to a final stage. =„ÇÑ ya and „Å® to= Ya is used for incomplete lists, whereas to is used for complete ones. = Historical particles = i was used in Old Japanese and kanbun works. Its meaning is still debated, but has traditionally been considered emphatic. Differences from English prepositions Many Japanese particles fill the role of prepositions in English, but they are unlike prepositions in many ways. Japanese does not have equivalents of prepositions like \\"on\\" or \\"about\\", and often uses particles along with verbs and nouns to modify another word where English might use prepositions. For example, ue is a noun meaning \\"top/up\\"; and ni tsuite is a fixed verbal expression meaning \\"concerning\\": : :Tƒìburu-no -ue-ni aru. :Table-OF top/up-AT exists. :\\"It's on the table.\\" : :Ano hito-wa, gitƒÅ-ni tsuite nandemo wakaru. :That person-TOPIC guitar-TO concerning anything knows. :\\"That person knows everything about guitars.\\"  See also  * Adposition * Chinese particles * Okinawan particles * Korean particles * Japanese counter words * Japanese grammar: particles * Japanese verb conjugations * Sentence-final particle * Particles of the Kagoshima dialects  Notes  References * Chino, Naoko.

It proved sufficient against infantry but, like the American M3 Stuart light tank, was not designed to combat other tanks. Approximately 2,300 were produced, making it the most numerous Japanese armoured fighting vehicle of the Second World War. History and development From early 1930s, the Japanese army began experimenting with a mechanized warfare unit combining infantry with tanks. However, the Type 89 Medium tank could not keep pace with the motorized infantry, which could move at by truck. For transport, tanks could be loaded on train platforms like in any other army of the times. To solve this problem, Tomio Hara of the Army Technical Bureau proposed a new light tank capable of 40 km/h speed and started development in 1933.Taki's Imperial Japanese Army: The Development of Imperial Japanese Tanks: \\"Type 95 Light Tank\\" The prototype of the tank was begun in 1933 and completed in June 1934 at the Army's Sagami Arsenal. Initial tests were positive, but it was too heavy at 7.5 tons and was reworked to bring the weight down to 6.5 tons. Due to doubts by the infantry as to its capability for infantry support it was tested in Manchuria in the winter of 1934/1935. The reports were favourable and a second prototype built, which was started in June and completed in November 1935. In 1935, at a meeting in the Army Technical Bureau, the Type 95 was proposed as the main tank for mechanized infantry units. The infantry had concerns that the armor was insufficient; however, the cavalry indicated that the improved speed and armament compensated for thin armor. In the end, the infantry agreed, as the Type 95 was still superior to the available alternatives of the Type 92 cavalry tank and Type 94 tankette.Report on Type 92 from September 1945 issue of Intelligence Bulletin The name was based on the year since the beginning of the Empire that the tank was produced; Type 2595. Sometimes a surname was used to supplement or replace the naming ideograms used for Japanese armored fighting vehicles. The Type 95 had the surname \\"Ha-Go\\" (third model) that was given by the designer of the tank, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries started production of the tank in 1936. Mass production began in 1938 with the tank and parts made by several different companies; besides Mitsubishi, that included, Niigata Tekkosh≈ç, Dowa Jido Sho, Sagami Arsenal Kokura Rikugu Jiohei Sho and Ihesil. Design Type 95 light tank Ha-Go Prototype, after the weight reduction modification, 1934 The Type 95 was a 7.4-ton vehicle with a complement of 3 crewmen: a commander, a hull machine gunner, and a driver. Only the commander was seated in the turret, hence he was responsible for observation, loading, aiming, firing the main gun, as well as decision-making and commanding the crew. The hand-operated turret was small and extremely cramped. The primary armament of the most produced version was a Type 94 (1934) 37 mm tank gun (not to be confused with the Type 94 37 mm anti- tank gun introduced two years later) with a barrel length of 46.1 calibers. It elevated between ‚àí15 to +20 degrees. The tank carried two types of 37 mm ammunition, the high-explosive and armor-piercing. For the latter, muzzle velocity was and armor penetration was at a distance of . Secondary armament was originally two 6.5 mm Type 91 machine guns, but these were replaced with two 7.7 mm Type 97 light machine guns, one mounted in the hull front and the other in the back of the turret, facing to the rear right (that is, in the five-o-clock direction). The most characteristic feature of the Type 95 tank was its simple suspension system. Army officer Tomio Hara designed the bell crank scissors system. This suspension system became standard on the majority of the subsequently designed Japanese tanks. For the Type 95, two paired bogie wheels per side were suspended on a single bell crank and connected to a coil spring mounted horizontally outside the hull. The tracks were driven through the front sprockets. There were two return wheels. The suspension had troubles early on, with a tendency to pitch on rough ground, and so it was modified with a brace to connect the pairs of bogies. Despite this, the tank continued to give its users a rough ride across any uneven ground. It was provided with an interior layer of asbestos padding separated from the hull with an air gap, to isolate the crew from the sun-heated armor plates, and to protect the crew from injury when the tank moved across rough terrain.U.S. War Department \\"Japanese Light Tank\\" Tactical and Technical Trends, No. 31, August 12, 1943. The Type 95 was fitted with a 120 hp (89.5 kW) Mitsubishi A6120VDe air-cooled 6-cylinder diesel engine. It was located in the rear compartment on the right side. The power unit gave it good mobility. Some tanks were fitted with two reflectors in the front of the vehicle for night operations. Variants Type 95 light tank Ha-Go 1st Prototype, before the weight reduction modification *Type 95 Ha-G≈ç (early production) :An early production version that differed from the most produced model by using less powerful armament: the main gun was 37 mm Type 94 with a barrel length of 36.7 calibers, muzzle velocity of 575 (1900 fps)History of War: Type 95 Ha-Go Light Tank-600 m/s (2200 fps), and armor penetration of 45 mm at 300 m (1.48 inches at 300 yards). Secondary armament consisted of two Type 91 6.5 mm machine guns. Produced until 1937 with less than 100 made. Used in Manchukuo and China. Of this variant, the very first production tanks used the older 110 hp (82 kW) Mitsubishi engine (as used in the Type 89 I-Go medium tank), and had a top speed of 25 mph (40 km/h). *Type 95 Ha-G≈ç (Hokuman version) :Due to issues in Manchukuo with sorghum grass in fields getting trapped in the suspension/wheels, the wheel and suspension components were inverted with the addition of small wheels fitted to the bell-crank axis so the tanks could move freely through the grass. This modified version was used in the Battle for Nomohan. It is sometimes informally referred to as the \\"Manchurian model\\". *Type 95 Ha-G≈ç (later production) :Among other improvements to the engine and main gun, the secondary armament was changed to two Type 97 7.7 mm machine guns, one in the rear section of the turret and one in the front hull. *Type 95 Ri-Ki Crane Vehicle :The Type 95 Ri-Ki was a tracked engineering vehicle. At the rear of the chassis, it had a 3-ton 4.5 meter \\"boomed crane\\".Taki‚Äôs Imperial Japanese Army: Type 95 Crane Vehicle \\"Ri-Ki\\" *Type 95 So-Ki armored railroad car :The Type 95 So-Ki was an armored railroad car designed to a requirement of the Kwantung Army for patrolling and guarding remote narrow gauge railway lines. It was fitted with a retractable wheel arrangement underneath to enable it to run on rails. Between 121 and 138 units were manufactured between 1935 and 1943, which operated in both China and Burma.Taki‚Äôs Imperial Japanese Army: Type 95 Armored Railroad Car \\"So-Ki\\" *Type 2 Ka-Mi Amphibious tank :This was the first amphibious tank produced in Japan, and was intended for use by the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces. The chassis was based on the Type 95 Ha-Go and its main armament was the same, a 37 mm tank gun. The pontoons were attached by a system of \\"small clips\\" with a release inside the tank, to be engaged once it landed for ground combat operations. The Type 2 Ka-Mi was first used in combat on Guadalcanal in late 1942. Later they were encountered by the United States Marine Corps in the Marshall Islands and Mariana Islands, particularly on Saipan. They were also used during the fighting on the Philippine island of Leyte in late 1944. They were made in 1943‚Äì1944, with 182 completed. *Type 3 Ke-Ri prototype :This was a proposed model with a Type 97 57 mm tank gun as the main armament in a modified turret. The chassis was the same as the Type 95 Ha-Go. The light tank had a weight of 7.4 tons and a crew of 3 men. It was determined that the turret was too cramped for the crewmen, once the main gun was installed. A small number of prototypes were produced, however, the design never got past the field testing stage.History of War: Type 3 Ke-Ri Type 4 Ke-Nu light tank *Type 4 Ke-Nu conversion :A conversion that replaced the existing turret with the larger turret of Type 97 Chi-Ha, armed with the low-velocity 57 mm gun. The conversions were done in 1944, with approximately 100 units completed.History of War: Type 4 Ke-Nu Type 4 Ho-To SPG with a Type 38 12 cm howitzer *Type 4 Ho-To prototype :The Ho-To was a self-propelled gun on a modified Ha-Go chassis. It mounted a Type 38 12 cm howitzer in an open casemate with frontal and side armour. One prototype was completed. *Type 5 Ho-Ru prototype :The Ho-Ru was a light tank destroyer similar to the German Hetzer, but armed with the weaker 47 mm main gun in a semi-enclosed casemate. The Type 5 Ho-Ru utilized the chassis of the Type 95 Ha-Go, but its suspension was enlarged to 350 mm track link width. There were two set rows of wheel guide pins, holding a road wheel between them. The sprocket of the driving wheel was the grating type to gear with the wheel guide pins like on the Soviet T-34. Development of the Type 5 Ho-Ru started in February 1945 with only one prototype being completed before the end of the war.Taki‚Äôs Imperial Japanese Army: Type 5 47mm SP Gun \\"Ho-Ru\\" Combat history Type 95 Ha-Go showing a flag signal during maneuvers Rear-side view of Type 95 Ha-Go Hokuman version (Manchurian model) The tank was considered one of the best of its type in 1935, being armed with a 37 mm cannon, and powered by a diesel engine, a fuel considered by some to be superior due to its low volatility.War Department, TM-E 30-480 pp. IX-183, 184Goldman p. 123 As with most armies in the 1930s the tank, and the light tank in particular, were used primarily to support infantry or serve as cavalry reconnaissance and to a lesser extent, as raiding vehicles. Its speed was about 18 mph cross country, which was comparable to the M3 Stuart's 20 mph nearly 6 years later in 1941. In armor, road speed, and weaponry, the Type 95 was far inferior to the (five years younger) American M3 Stuart light tanks, but the environment of the Philippines (where roads were sparse and tank engagements took place at near point blank range) largely minimized these disadvantages and allowed the Type 95 to be competitive, as its off-road speed and turret rotation were comparable. Type 95 proved sufficient against opposing infantry in campaigns in Manchuria and China, as the Chinese National Revolutionary Army had only three tank battalions consisting of Vickers export tanks, German PzKpfw I light tanks, and Italian CV33 tankettes to oppose them. However, the Type 95, like the US M3 Stuart, was not designed to fight other tanks, but for infantry support. Due to the IJN's priority in receiving new technology and steel for warship construction, tanks for the IJA and the IJN's SNLF detachments were relegated to receiving what was left. By 1942, Japanese armor remained largely the same as it did in the 1930s, and new tank development was \\"stymied\\". =Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) 1939= Under the mistaken belief that the Red Army was retreating from the area of the Khalkhyn Gol river, the IJA command in Manchuria transferred the 1st Tank Corps, under the command of Lt. Gen. Yasuoka Masaomi to the village of Nomonhan to cut off the retreating Soviets at Khalkhyn Gol. After a two-day journey by rail, the 1st Tank Corps began unloading its 3rd Tank Regiment and 4th Tank Regiment from their trains at Arshaan in Manchuria on 22 June 1939. While the 3rd Tank Regiment was composed primarily of the nearly decade-old Type 89 medium tanks, the 4th Tank Regiment, commanded by 48-year-old Col. Tamada Yoshio, consisted of 35 Type 95 light tanks, eight Type 89s, and three Type 94 tankettes. From the beginning of Soviet General Zhukov's assumption of command at Nomonhan in June 1939, he had deployed his BT-5 and BT-7 light tanks (Bystrokhodnyi tanks, meaning \\"high-speed tank\\") and incorporated them into all of his combined artillery, infantry, and armor attacks. Although in the same light tank category as the Type 95, also with 3 man crews, and similar dimensions, the BT tanks were nearly twice as heavy, at 13.8 tons but were highly susceptible to close- quarter (tank killer) teams using fire bombs (Molotov cocktails); that was primarily due to their gasoline engines. As such, Japanese tank crews held a generally low opinion of the Soviet Red Army tanks, but the BT tank's 45 mm gun was a different matter. With a velocity of over , Soviet tanks could penetrate the Japanese tanks at a range of over 1,000 meters (the Type 95's 37 mm main gun had a maximum effective range of less than 700 meters); as one Type 95 tank officer put it, \\"...no sooner did we see the flash, than there would be a hole in our tank! And the Russians were good shots too!\\" On 2 July 1939, at approximately 18:10 hours (6:10 pm), Col. Tamada's 4th Tank Regiment of more mobile Type 95 tanks took the lead in front of the medium tanks of the 3rd Tank Regiment, as the 1st Tank Corps launched its first offensive against the Soviet forces at Khalkhin Gol. While the 3rd Tank Regiment passed through Soviet artillery fire, becoming decisively engaged by about 20:00 hours (8 pm) during their movement forward, the 4th Tank Regiment, while avoiding Soviet artillery barrages had advanced in a southeast direction instead of due south, engaging Soviet forces southwest of Uzuru pond. Observing a Russian artillery battery between himself and his objective, a \\"junction\\", Col. Tamada ordered an attack in the darkness. At about 23:00 hours (11 pm), the 4th Tank moved towards their objective with about 6 meters between tanks and 30 meters between companies and platoons. Just after midnight, a thunderstorm struck, conveniently exposing the Soviet positions while at the same time masking the advancing 4th Tank Regiment. While at close range, the lightning storm suddenly illuminated the advancing Type 95s, and the Soviet defense line immediately opened fire with heavy machine guns, artillery, BT-7 light tanks, and anti-tank guns. However, since the range was so close, the Soviet artillery could not depress their barrels low enough to hit the tanks, and their shells flew wildly over the advancing tanks. At about 00:20 hours (12:20 am) Col. Tamada ordered the 4th Tank Regiment to \\"charge\\", and by 02:00 hours his light tanks had penetrated over 1,000 yards through Soviet lines and knocked out 12 artillery guns. Japanese losses consisted of one Type 95 light tank, one officer and one enlisted man killed and 8 wounded; the 4th Tank had expended approximately 1,100 37 mm and 129 57 mm tank shells, and 16,000 rounds of machine gun ammunition. After the action, the Soviet command acknowledged that 1st Tank Corps armor had reached the Russian guns. =Malaya, Burma and the Philippines, 1941 to 1942= 2-pounder anti-tank gun during the Battle of Muar in the Malayan Campaign. One of six Ha-Go tanks destroyed by an Australian OQF 2-pounder anti-tank gun in the Battle of Muar. The escaping tank crew were killed by Allied infantry. The United States military had been operating in the Philippines since the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War (1899-1902) and the United Kingdom had military bases in Singapore since at least the 1840s; they both had many years of so-called \\"jungle warfare\\" experience between them, which no doubt influenced their beliefs that \\"tanks could not operate in those jungles\\". On the other hand, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) had always been focused upon the Soviet Union and China and had never conducted major military campaigns in tropical (jungle) regions. Facing thick and impenetrable jungles, two experienced and powerful armies, and lacking any jungle combat experience themselves, the IJA's Type 95s, together with Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tanks, led the Japanese assault forces into taking British Malaya and Singapore by 15 February in 1942 and Corregidor in the US- held Philippines by April in that same year. The Type 95 proved to be an extremely successful light tank during the early military campaigns of Japan leading into mid-1942. The \\"rough terrain\\" did not prove to be a severe obstacle for the generally-light Japanese armour. In addition, poor planning on the part of the British Army resulted in very few to practically no tanks being deployed by the UK in British Malaya or the British colony of Burma by December 1941. =America's first clash of armor in World War II= America's first tank versus tank battle of World War II occurred when Type 95 light tanks of the IJA 4th Tank Regiment engaged a US Army tank platoon, consisting of five brand new M3 Stuart light tanks from \\"B\\" company, 192nd Tank Battalion, on 22 December 1941, north of Damortis during the retreat to the Bataan Peninsula in 1941. Both the M3 and Type 95 light tanks were armed with a 37 mm gun, but the M3 was better armored, with 32 mm (1¬º inches) thick turret sides, vs the Type 95's 12 mm thick armor; however, as the US Army's Ballistics Research Lab (BRL) found after conducting the first large study of tank vs tank warfare in 1945, the most important factor in a tank duel was which side spotted the enemy first, fired first, and hit first. In this first engagement the IJA reacted first, destroying the lead M3 as it tried to leave the road. The four remaining American tanks all suffered hits as they retreated. On 6 June 1942, the Japanese 3rd Special Naval Landing Forces (SNLF) landed on Kiska Island during the Japanese invasion of the Aleutian Islands, part of today's state of Alaska. The SNLF landing was reinforced by Type 95 light tanks from the IJAs 11th Tank Regiment, which became the only enemy tanks to ever land on United States soil. After the U.S./Allied landing of Kiska to recapture the island in August 1943, the U.S. captured two Type 95s and transported them to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland for study and evaluation. =Against Australia= Two Type 95 tanks were deployed to support the Japanese landing at Milne Bay, New Guinea, in late August 1942. Initially, the tanks proved successful against the lightly armed Australian infantry, whose 'sticky bombs' failed to stick due to the humidity. Although the tanks had proved reliable in the tropical conditions of Malaya, they could not handle the volume of mud caused by intense, almost daily rainfall at Milne Bay. Both tanks were bogged down and abandoned a few days after the landing. =10-year-old warhorse= A Type 95 knocked out during the Battle of Tarawa A disabled Type 95 at Biak Type 95 Ha-Go tanks in New Britain following the Japanese surrender The Type 95 first began to show its vulnerability during later battles against British/Commonwealth forces, where the tank's 37 mm gun could not penetrate the armor of the British Matilda infantry tanks which were deployed against them. The thin armor of the Type 95 made it increasingly vulnerable, as Allied forces realized that standard infantry weapons were capable of penetrating the minimal armor around the engine block, and even its thickest armor was vulnerable to heavy machine gun fire. By 1944, it was already known that the 10-year-old Type 95 light tank's firepower was insufficient to take on the newest US tanks, such as the medium M4 Sherman, or the M5 Stuart light tank, although the Type 95 could still give the older M3 Stuart light tank a run for its money at close range. In August 1942, the US launched its first counter-offensive against Japan, when it landed US Marines on Guadalcanal. The US Marine Corps deployed its 1st Tank Battalion, which was equipped with the only M2A4 light tanks to see combat with US forces during World War II. The M2A4 was the foundation for the M3 Stuart, and both vehicles were nearly identical when viewed side by side; with the primary difference being the rear idler wheel lowered to the ground on the M3. Although the M2A4 was newer by five years, being built in 1940, than the Type 95, it was the closest US tank in armament and armor to the Type 95 light tank; with 25 mm (1\\") thick turret sides vs the 95's 12 mm turret sides; and both tanks were equipped with 37 mm main guns. Several Type 95s were destroyed or captured by the United States Army during the Battle of Biak in 1944. As the tide of the war turned against Japan, the Type 95s were increasingly expended in banzai charges or were dug-in as pillboxes in static defense positions in the Japanese-occupied islands. During the Battle of Tarawa, seven entrenched Type 95s of the 7th Sasebo SNLF opposed the American landings. Those seven, along with the two on nearby Makin Island, were destroyed. More were destroyed on Parry Island and on Eniwetok. On Saipan, Type 95s attacked the American Marine beachhead at dawn on 16 June 1944, and were destroyed by tank fire. The US Marines had landed the day before with two tank battalions. On the night of 16‚Äì17 June, the Japanese made an \\"all-out counterattack\\". Leading the attack were 44 tanks of the IJA 9th Tank Regiment. The Type 97s and Type 95s were knocked out by a Marine platoon of M4A2 tanks, several M3 75mm half-tracks, bazookas and 37mm antitank guns. It was the largest Japanese armor attack of the war. During the Battle of Guam, 29 Type 97 and Type 95 tanks of the IJA 9th Tank Regiment and nine Type 95s of the 24th Tank Company were lost to bazooka fire or M4 tanks. Seven more were destroyed on Tinian on 24 July, and 15 more on Battle of Peleliu on 15 September. Likewise, in the Philippines, at least ten Type 95s were destroyed in various engagements on Leyte, and another 20 on Luzon. At the Battle of Okinawa, 13 Type 95s and 14 Type 97 Shinhoto medium tanks of the understrength IJA 27th Tank Regiment faced 800 American tanks of eight US Army and two USMC tank battalions. =China-Burma-India theater of operations= In 1942 the IJA pushed through Southeast Asia, through Thailand and into Burma, and headed for India. Type 95 light tanks of the IJA 14th Tank Regiment led the way. They engaged the M3 Stuarts of the British 7th Hussars and 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, and as the British retreated towards India, the IJA re-equipped their armoured units, following significant losses of Type 95s in combat, with at least some captured US M3 Stuart light tanks seized from the British. By 1944, the 14th Tank Regiment was effectively starved of its combat supplies due to British deep battle tactics of cutting the IJA's logistical lines, and a final push by the IJA was stopped at Imphal in northeastern India. In the Battle of Hukawng Valley, Japanese Type 95 tanks of the 18th Division were joined by remnants of the 14th Tank Division. They were met with the offensive launched by the India-based Nationalist Chinese Army but the Japanese troops were virtually annihilated with the rest of the division as only 1,700 out of the 12,000 strong Chrysanthemum Division managed to break out.1937 China When the M4 Sherman became available for the British to use in the North Africa campaign, they were able to transfer their M3 Medium tanks to India and Burma, which by then had become obsolete in the fighting in Europe, but the Type 95 was outclassed by these M3 tanks. When the war ended in 1945 and Japan capitulated, many Type 95s were left behind in China. They were used on both the Nationalist and Communist sides during the Chinese Civil War. After the Communists' victory in 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) continued to use them in their inventory. =Manchuria and the Kuril Islands= Although tank brigades equipped with the Type 95 were present during the 1945 Soviet invasion of Manchuria, the war ended before the Red Army had engaged their main formations. The only use of the Type 95 in any numbers against Soviet forces was at the Battle of Shumshu during the Invasion of the Kuril Islands, when shortly before the Japanese surrender had been finalized, they formed part of an armored force which unsuccessfully attacked the Soviet beach head, but was defeated by their anti-tank guns. =Usage after the war= Survivors Japanese type 95 3.jpgType 95 Ha-G≈ç on display at the now-defunct United States Army Ordnance Museum File:Type_95_Tank_Lampang_Thailand_016.jpgType 95 Tank displays in front of Surasakmontree Army Camp, Lampang, Thailand, 2016 File:Type 95 Ha Go tank under restoration in Sept 2012.JPGThe Australian War Memorial's Type 95 during restoration in 2012 File:US Army Museum of Hawaii - IMG 2408.JPGType 95 on display at the Battery Randolf US Army Museum, Honolulu Although no surviving examples of the Type 95 light tank remain in Japan, a number have been preserved at museums around the world.

The tank is no longer operational, however, as the original engine encountered mechanical issues and lost oil pressure during a test drive.

Fredriksen (born January 6, 1951, Kingston, Rhode Island)U.S. Public Records Index Vol 1 & 2 (Provo, UT: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.), 2010. is an American historian and scholar of religious studies. She held the position of William Goodwin Aurelio Professor of the Appreciation of Scripture at Boston University through 2010 and is now the William Goodwin Aurelio Chair Emerita of the Appreciation of Scripture. She served as historical consultant for the BBC production The Lives of Jesus (1996) and for U.S. News and World Report 's \\"The Life and Times of Jesus\\" and was featured speaker in the Frontline documentary From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians (1998), based heavily on her book From Jesus to Christ: The Origins of the New Testament Images of Jesus. Early life Fredriksen earned her B.A. degree with Phi Beta Kappa in Religion and History in 1973 from the Wellesley College and a year later got a diploma in theology from Oxford University. In 1979, she earned a Ph.D. in the history of religion from Princeton University and until 1980 was the Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University. Career =Early career= Fredriksen began her career as a lecturer at the Department of Religion of Princeton University in 1978. From 1979 to 1980 she was a faculty member at the Department of Religious Studies at Stanford University. She relocated to the University of California, Berkeley, where from 1980 to 1986 she was an assistant professor at the Department of History and from 1986 to 1989 worked as an associate professor at the Department of Religious Studies, of Pittsburgh University. =Later career= Fredriksen is a scholar of the historical Jesus. She sides with those who portray him as an apocalyptic preacher in the tradition of prophets before him and apostles after him. In addition to the historical Jesus, Fredriksen is also interested in the social history of Christianity from its beginnings to the fall of the Roman Empire. She has published two books on St. Augustine, both focused on his attitudes towards Jews and Judaism. In contrast to other historians of Christian anti-Semitism, she regards Augustine as having a more enlightened, indeed revolutionary, attitude towards Jews and Judaism than many of his other Christian contemporaries. One of the editors of her book From Jesus to Christ: The Origins of the New Testament Images of Jesus was the New Testament scholar E.P. Sanders. Along with Geza Vermes, she is often regarded as one of the most influential scholars interested in replacing Jesus within a Jewish context. She has held that much of the scholarship regarding Jesus from the 19th and 20th centuries has an anti-Judaic (and/or anti-Semitic) bias, a theme explored in her book Jesus, Judaism, and Christian anti-Judaism: Reading the New Testament after the Holocaust. Her book From Jesus to Christ, (Yale University Press, 1988) received the Yale Press Governors' Award.https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/etc/bios.html Her book Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews: A Jewish Life and the Emergence of Christianity (Knopf 1999) won a National Jewish Book Award.

It is the second of his five Arthurian romances; Erec and Enide, Clig√®s, Yvain, Lancelot and Perceval. The poem tells the story of the knight Clig√®s and his love for his uncle's wife, Fenice. Background Clig√®s has come down to us through seven manuscripts and various fragments. The poem comprises 6,664 octosyllables in rhymed couplets. Prose versions also exist since at least the 15th century. There are many stylistic techniques that set Chr√©tien de Troyes and his work Clig√®s apart from his contemporaries and their work. Chr√©tien used many Latin writing techniques such as nature , , , and to convey a realistic romance story.Luttrell, Claude. The Creation of the First Arthurian Romance: A Quest. (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1974). Clig√®s can be better understood by dividing the text into two parts, or two nearly separate stories. The first story consists of Clig√®s's father's adventures and the second story consists of Clig√®s's adventures. Clig√®s scholar Z.P. Zaddy supports the dual story approach, but also divides the text even further as creates a new structure where the two stories are split into eight episodes. This approach is intended to make the text read more dramatically. Synopsis Clig√®s begins with the story of the title character's parents, Alexander and Tantalis. Alexander, the son of the Greek emperor (also called Alexander), travels to Britain to become a knight in King Arthur's realm. While at court, Alexander gains favor with King Arthur, is knighted, and assists in retaking Windsor Castle from the traitorous Count Angr√®s. During his time at court, Alexander meets Arthur's niece, Soredamors; they quickly fall in love, but neither party is able to tell the other how they feel. Queen Guinevere takes notice and encourages them to express their mutual love. They then marry and a child is born, named Clig√®s. Alexander and his family then return to Greece and find out that Alexander's brother, Alis, has claimed the Greek throne after their father's death. Although Alexander is the rightful heir to the throne, he concedes to Alis under the condition that Alis not marry or have children, so that the throne will pass to Clig√®s. Alexander then dies, and Clig√®s is raised in Greece. Many years after Alexander's death, Alis is persuaded to marry. He chooses as his bride Fenice, the daughter of the German Emperor. Thus begins the story of Clig√®s and Fenice. Clig√®s falls in love with his uncle's wife, who also loves Clig√®s; he follows in his father's footsteps to Arthur's kingdom to be knighted. Like his father, he does well in King Arthur's court, participating in tournaments and displaying courtly manners. He is knighted and returns home. As Clig√®s and Fenice still love each other, Fenice concocts a plan to use magic to trick Alis and allow them to escape. With the help of a potion provided by her governess, she fakes illness so that she could eventually die and reunite with Clig√®s. However, before she could fake her actual death, three doctors are called in to heal Fenice. Upon realizing Fenice's deception, the three doctors torture Fenice in order to discover what she is hiding. Fenice, however, says nothing and is eventually spirited away by Clig√®s. Soon, however, they are found in their tower hiding-place by Bertrand, who tells Alis. Clig√®s goes to Arthur to ask for help in getting his kingdom back from his uncle, but Alis dies while he is away. Clig√®s and Fenice now are free to marry, and Clig√®s becomes emperor.Chr√©tien de Troyes; Owen, D. D. R. (translator) (1988). Arthurian Romances. New York: Everyman's Library. . Analysis In Clig√®s and Courtliness, Norris J. Lacy examines the characters found in Clig√®s and argues that Chr√®tien uses the story as an ironic presentation of chivalric character. Although Clig√®s displays the ability to master the social forms and rhetoric of the court, it is without substance. Lacy claims that the actions of Clig√®s and Fenice may seem to represent courtliness or chivalric traits, but at their core they are not moral. Lacy believes that Chr√®tien's Clig√®s is meant to throw doubt on the value and validity of courtliness.Lacy, Norris J. \\"Clig√®s\\" and Courtliness\\". Interpretations, Vol. 15, No. 2 Arthurian Interpretations. 1984, pp 18‚Äì24.Lacy, Norris J. (1991). \\"Chr√©tien de Troyes\\". In Norris J. Lacy, The New Arthurian Encyclopedia, pp. 88‚Äì91. New York: Garland. . The discussion of morality in relation to Fenice's character continues in 'The Public and Private of 'Cliges Fenice', written by D. Nelson. Nelson, like Lacy, claims that Fenice's actions are not moral, even though readers are expected to celebrate her happy ending with Clig√®s. Despite her happy marriage at the end, Nelson notes how Fenice fails in avoiding Iseut's reputation-- Iseut, another adulteress who Fenice looks down upon. However, as a result of Fenice's own plotting to maintain her relationship with Clig√®s, she presents herself as \\"an adultress who went to any extreme to satisfy her passion\\" Nelson, D. (1981) The public and private images of 'Clig√®s' Fenice. Reading Medieval Studies, VII. pp. 8188. ISSN 0950-3129. Instead of being remembered as the heroine, then, Fenice is remembered as a sinner who must atone for her sins. Nelson finds such atonement take form in the presentation of the three doctors who attempt to take care of Fenice when she feigns illness. However, when the doctors start to hurt Fenice in an effort to discover what her true plot is, Nelson claims the readers \\"heartily approves\\" Nelson, D. (1981) The public and private images of 'Clig√®s' Fenice. Reading Medieval Studies, VII. pp. 8188. ISSN 0950-3129. Because of such approval, the readers therefore view the torture Fenice experiences as a form of atonement or necessary punishment for Fenice's immoral actions. . Clig√®s scholar Lucie Polak verifies the Tristan and Isolde reworking found in the text, but also suggests that Clig√®s may be modeled after Ovid's character Narcissus.Polak, Lucie. Chr√©tien de Troyes: Clig√©s. (London: Grant & Cutler Ltd, 1982). Clig√®s opening lines give some of the only extant information on the creator's biography and earlier work. Other versions Another version of the romance is a Middle High German version known from a few fragments and references. In the 15th century, an unknown Burgundian author created a prose version of Chr√©tien's Clig√®s, under the title Le Livre de Alixandre Empereur de Constentinoble et de Clig√©s Son Filz.Colombo Timelli, Maria. Le Livre de Alixandre Empereur de Constentinoble et de Clig√©s Son Filz. Gen√®ve: Librairie Droz, 2004. This prose version differs from the original in several aspects, and the story is thought to have been adapted to the cultural and political circumstances of the Burgundian court at the time. Its first modern prose edition was written by Wendelin Foerster. Other appearances of Clig√®s  The character Clig√®s himself appears in other stories, including in the First Continuation of Chr√©tien's Perceval, where the father of Clig√®s is named as King Lac, and in Claris et Laris. In the Romanz du reis Yder, Clig√®s serves Queen Guenloie until he is expelled from her court after he criticizes her love for Yder, but Yder later promises to reconcile them. In Les Merveilles de Rigomer, Clig√®s hails from Greece and participates in the quest to conquer Rigomer Castle as one of Gawain's many companions; he also defeats the undead knight in his own episode.

The community was founded in 1849 by St. John Henry Newman, Cong.Orat., the first house of that congregation in England. Part of the complex of the Oratory is the Parish Church of the Immaculate Conception, commonly referred to as the Oratory Church. It now also serves as the national shrine to Newman. History The nave of the Oratory church The altar of the Oratory church Saint John Henry Newman, the founder of the Birmingham Oratory, after his conversion to the Catholic Church was seeking a way of life to live out his vocation. In common with a colleague from the Oxford Movement and fellow convert, Frederick William Faber, he had felt drawn to the way of life of the community founded by St. Philip Neri in Italy in the 16th century. When Saint Newman went to Rome in 1845 to become a Catholic priest, he was authorised by Pope Pius IX to establish a community of the Oratory in England. Returning to England in 1847, Saint Newman gathered a small community of his followers who also wished to live this life. They initially found a home in Birmingham at the Church of St. Anne on Alcester Street, which became the first house of an Oratorian community in England in 1849. A more suitable location was eventually located in Birmingham, and construction was begun of a residence and church. The Oratorian community relocated there in 1852. It became a parish church for the local area and has served the congregation in various ways through the decades. Upon the second death within the Oratorian community, Newman realised that they needed a cemetery. Through a donation given to him by the Catholic population of New York City in a show of support, he had been able to acquire property in the rural location of Rednal, where the community established a cemetery for the deceased of the congregation and also built a small summer house. =Music= The Oratory has a heritage of the promotion of great music in its worship. This goes back to its founder, St. Philip Neri, who believed strongly in the power of music for bringing out the good in people. The original Oratory in Rome was one of the great centres of sacred music for the city. The most celebrated singers and composers of the day would perform there. From this heritage comes the word oratorio. Right from its founding, the Birmingham Oratory has been noted for the high level of its music, due largely to the active interest of Newman himself. The parish continues to provide services which use the music of Palestrina, William Byrd, Tom√°s Luis de Victoria, Haydn, Mozart, as well as modern composers. =Education= Newman also founded the Oratory School there in 1859, as a Catholic alternative to Eton College. It relocated to near Reading in 1922. In 1887 two priests of the Oratory took over an existing school intended to provide an education to the poor Catholic boys of the area. This became St. Philip's School, which operated until 1995. =Current church= The dome of the Oratory church The current church was constructed between 1907 and 1910 in the Baroque style to replace the original structure as a memorial to Newman. It was designed by the architect Edward Doran Webb.The Buildings of England. Warwickshire. Nikolaus Pevsner. It is familiarly called the Little Rome in Birmingham. Prior to a final determination regarding the beatification of Newman, the Holy See gave instructions that his remains were to be transferred from the Oratorian cemetery in the West Midlands to the Oratory Church. A marble tomb was constructed to receive them, but not installed in the church. When the church and civil authorities opened the grave in October 2008, they found no human remains. The Grade II* listed church continues to serve the Congregation of the Oratory there. Elsewhere in England, there are also communities of the Congregation at the Brompton Oratory in London and the Oxford Oratory. In February 2012, the church suffered the theft of a large metal cross from its roof. The loss was valued at ¬£30,000. Tolkien and the Oratory The Birmingham Oratory was to play a major role in the life of J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of The Lord of the Rings, who was a parishioner there for about nine years during his childhood. After the unexpected death of their father in South Africa, their mother, Mabel Suffield Tolkien, began to seek a spiritual home where she could find support in her struggle as a widow and single mother of little financial means. Fifty years after the establishment of the Oratorian community there, she started to attend the Church of St. Anne. The family was received into the Catholic Church in the spring of 1900, provoking opposition from the Tolkien family as well as her own. A small gift from a relative enabled the young Ronald Tolkien (as he was called by his family) to enroll in the prestigious King Edward's School in Birmingham. This required the family to relocate. Not finding the spiritual support she needed in the local Catholic parish there, Mabel Tolkien began to take her two boys on long walks into the country on Sundays. Through these she came to know the Oratory, and found a friend in the community in the person of Fr. Francis Xavier Morgan, Cong.Orat. The young Ronald had enrolled in the school without having been given a scholarship, and the tuition and fees weighed heavily upon the family income. When Father Morgan became aware of this, he made arrangements for the boy to transfer to the St. Philip's School. That, along with tutoring by his mother at home, allowed Ronald to gain a scholarship and to return to King Edward's School. When Mabel Tolkien's health began to decline as a result of diabetes, Francis Morgan used his personal income to provide a home for the family in the vicinity of their rural house. After her death in 1904, fearing that their relations might force the boys to give up their Catholic faith, Mabel Tolkien appointed Father Morgan as their legal guardian. Morgan then supported the Tolkien boys out of his own pocket, paying Mabel's sister to house the boys. They found a real home, however, in the parish community of the Oratory, taking part in activities such as scouting there, which gave them an outlet for their youthful energies and companionship. Newman's beatification The Oratory was visited by Pope Benedict XVI, immediately after the beatification Mass of John Henry Newman, which was held at Cofton Park in Birmingham on 19 September 2010. It was the first beatification ceremony ever held in England. Oratory House The living quarters of the community is called the Oratory House (1850-51), fronting Hagley Road. Except for four years spent in Ireland, it served as Newman's home from 1852 to 1890. His personal papers are located here. Organ A short informational video on the Birmingham Oratory. The organ dates from 1909 and was installed by Nicholson of Worcester. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. Controversy After a canonical visitation by the Holy See, in May 2010 the Rev'd Fr. Paul Chavasse, Cong.Orat., was removed from his position as Provost of the Oratory. This came after it was learned that he had entered a \\"close but chaste\\" relationship with a younger man. He had also served as the Postulator for the cause of Newman's canonisation. Shortly thereafter, two priests and a lay brother were transferred from the Oratory. This is a highly unusual step, as the members of the Oratory make their commitment to a particular community, where they then spend their lives. The two priests were assigned to live in two different monasteries, while Bro. Lewis Berry, Cong.Orat., who was preparing for ordination, was sent to the Port Elizabeth Oratory, a newly founded Oratory in South Africa, for an indefinite period. The reason given for this was that the African Oratory would provide him \\"greater opportunities for a varied programme of pastoral work\\" needed for service as a deacon. This resulted in his not being present for Newman's beatification ceremony, although he had run the website of Newman's cause for canonisation. One of the priests, the Rev'd Fr. Dermot Fenlon, Cong.Orat., was reported to have exclaustration imposed on him, as he was unwilling to agree to his move.The Catholic Herald ‚Äì Simon Caldwell ‚Äì 10 September 2010 The Birmingham Post reported that the three were popular with parishioners and that a campaign group, \\"Free The Birmingham Oratory Three\\" was formed. Berry, however, called upon the protests to stop, saying that he welcomed the move as providing new possibilities in his vocation. In 2012 the Oratory paid an undisclosed sum to former director of music Nicholas Johnson after he was unfairly dismissed when the Oratory faced financial problems References External links * Official website * The Latin Mass Society of England and Wales * \\"Free the Birmingham 3: Justice for Fr.

Description White stemmed wattle usually grows as a dense shrub between in height and is often much wider than it is tall. The trunks and branchlets are often coated with a white powdery substance. Its branches are white or greenish-white, with many bends and twists. Like many other Acacia species, it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. These are bluish-green, from in length long, and wide. The flower heads are bright yellow and spherical, and occur in group of six to nine, but sometimes up to fifteen. It flowers in late winter and spring between August and October.

Paris is introduced as an ambitious high-school student from a wealthy family, who was raised almost entirely by her nanny. She has an extreme form of a Type A personality, driven to succeed and going to any extreme to get what she wants, whether it be a high grade or a life goal, and is very disappointed with herself and others if she does not achieve. This is in stark contrast to her friend Rory Gilmore, who is much more relaxed and casual about most matters, and the only person close to Paris who can consistently pacify her. Paris's style of speaking is usually brash and matter-of-fact, and it is very rare that she lapses away from her usual tone. Paris was conceived as a short-term character who would serve as Rory's foil and arch-nemesis in high school. However, the role was gradually developed by series creator Amy Sherman- Palladino and her husband/writing partner Dan, and Paris would remain for the entirety of the series while growing closer to Rory. Weil's performance won critical acclaim, with Paris becoming one of the show's most popular and topical characters. Introduction of Paris Paris was originally created for a three-episode guest arc by series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and executive producer Gavin Polone at the beginning of the show's first season to introduce Rory Gilmore's character to the high pressures, competitiveness and stress of going from the small public high school in Stars Hollow, to the storied and respected halls of Hartford's Chilton Academy. This character was created in consolation for Weil (who had been signed to a talent holding deal with show distributor Warner Bros. Television the year before, guest-starring through her arrangement on The West Wing and ER) after a strong audition for the role of Rory (Weil had previously been known to Polone through her work in the role of Debbie Kozac, a character who served a minor but pivotal role to as a babysitter Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon)'s child in the 1999 film Stir of Echoes, which he and his company produced), which eventually went to Alexis Bledel. Weil, however, had to change her hair color to play Paris from her natural brown hair coloring to blonde. This was done to further the contrast of Paris to Rory. The character proved to be the proper foil to Rory in time, and the role of Paris in the show was extended and expanded through the first season until Weil became a series regular in the second season. Plot lines =Season 1= On her first day at Chilton Academy, the soft-spoken Rory Gilmore meets the high-strung Paris Geller, who immediately views Rory as an academic rival. Prior to this encounter, Paris reads Rory's Stars Hollow transcript, courtesy of a student worker in the administration office she paid to sneak her the information out the window. The first day with the younger Gilmore ends up challenging Paris, and a few hours after giving Rory a lecture that she wouldn't make things easy, Rory accidentally broke Paris' castle project after tumbling into her because of a stuck locker. Paris refuses Rory's offered help to put it back together, and in spite the new girl answers lecture questions usually tackled by Paris right away. Relations between the two remain frosty through their first semester as her crush Tristan gave more attention to Rory than to Paris, whom he considered a platonic friend. After Rory earns a D in a literature class as she tries to catch up with her classmates, Paris jokes bitterly the grade would be perfect to apply for work at McDonald's. Later, the comment would come back to haunt her as an annoyed Rory went off on her for calling her a \\"loser\\" during a test she failed to make due to oversleeping. Paris' backstory is built with each episode after this point. She is forced by her mother to attend Rory's 16th birthday party thrown by her grandparents, and makes it clear doesn't enjoy it. Later, she bumps into Rory at a college fair, and away from the pressures of school and Tristan, she opens up a little to the girl, discussing Harvard and how she hopes to go there one day, as does Rory. Though they don't get along, they agree to disagree and be cordial to each other, noting that Harvard is a big campus and they probably would not see each other again after Chilton. Her hidden crush on Tristan is a major theme for the first season, and as she sells tickets to the school's Winter Formal, tries to bring up the courage to ask him out when he tries to buy his tickets. However she backs off after he makes a flirty comment about her already having a date. She takes out that bitterness on Rory for not wanting him and yells at the girl as she buys her tickets, not realizing that Rory already has a boyfriend in the local new boy, Dean. Because she needs a date for the Formal, she is forced after asking her mother to take her cousin Jacob as a date. Paris is able to keep it a secret for at least half the dance, until Jacob asks Rory if he could have her phone number and reveals his bloodline connection to Rory's rival. Though Rory doesn't say anything, Paris ends up jumping to conclusions and yells at Rory in front of all at the Formal in attendance, angered that Rory would divulge such secret information. However Rory had said nothing, and Paris unwittingly revealed her own secret. Paris's parents then went through a nasty, messy divorce that was the talk of Chilton with many tabloid-like rumors of affairs and plastic surgery flying through the gossip mill, and despite her exceptional success at school, Paris' self-esteem suffered as her home was torn apart with Mrs. Geller replacing all reminders of her husband, and pushing Paris to bring up her self-esteem, be less introverted, and use makeup and topical medications to hide blemishes. During this same period, she caught Max Medina, her literature teacher, passionately kissing Rory's mother Lorelai, and spread the gossip to assert herself over Rory and to take the heat off the negative attention she was receiving in the wake of the divorce. After Rory confronts Paris and asks her to explain why she's treating her the way she is when she was nothing but nice to Paris, she reveals some sorrow and guilt over spreading the news and speaks out about how the divorce has affected her. Knowing the girl was in a tough position, Rory tells Paris that if she needs help with anything, she can come to her and talk about anything she might need to. The girls are then put together for a project in a government class (along with Madeline and Louise), and the four decide to use Rory's home in Stars Hollow as a meeting place for the project, which just happens to be at the same time Lorelai is organizing the town's rummage sale, filling the house with assorted clothes and merchandise. Madeline and Louise seem to want to befriend Rory and are yelled at several times by Paris to keep working, but keep going back to talking about Rory's relationship with Dean, annoying Paris to no end. Later, Lorelai gets an idea upon seeing Rory, Madeline and Louise bond, and invites all four girls to a Bangles concert in Manhattan. Paris declines to go, but is talked into it by her friends, and surprisingly enjoys the music and the band, and then enjoys the unwanted attention Madeline and Louise end up with after sneaking off with some boys to a party nearby, watching as Lorelai becomes authoritarian and lets it known that she won't allow any trouble around Rory. After all of this, she tells Rory that the evening was the best night of her life. Slowly Paris and Rory become friendly toward each other, and Rory tries to help out the girl by asking Tristan to take her out on a date, then help her dress for it. The date seems to be a success, but Tristan remains focused on wanting Rory, and unwittingly reveals that Rory asked him to ask Paris out. She takes offense to this, and again they become distant, Tristan getting in the way of their friendship to the point where he spreads word at the end of the school year that he would take Rory to a PJ Harvey concert. Seemingly, this is the last straw for Paris, and she cuts Rory fully out of her peer circle, using her new power as editor of The Franklin, the school's newspaper to prevent the younger Gilmore from any advancement in position, assigning her to do a menial report about a parking lot paving project to start her Franklin career. =Season 2= Eventually, Paris and Rory realize that they work better together than apart, and after a few more underhanded moves to annoy Rory away from her, Paris eventually accepts her as a friend and an unsaid co-editor on The Franklin. Also helping is the departure of Tristan for military school in North Carolina after he gets into trouble and falls in with a bad clique in the school over the summer, which culminates in a failed robbery of a safe belonging to the father of one of his new friends. As his departure took place mere moments from a performance of the last act of Romeo and Juliet Paris was producing, in which Tristan was to play Romeo and Rory, Juliet, Paris had to step in at the last second to don a male wig and portray Romeo. After being encouraged to be more social, Rory then found herself about to get into Chilton's most prestigious sororities, The Puffs, which was led by one of Paris' rivals, Francine Jarvis. Paris had always wanted to get into this club too, as it ensured many guarantees for when she got into Harvard (which involved a show-created history where Sandra Day O'Connor was a member), and she asks Rory to put in a good word. Her plan works, and both girls find themselves about to be initiated into the Puffs (which involved a late-night burglary into Headmaster Charleston's office to ring a bell), when Charleston walked into his office with security mid-initiation, hastening the end of the Puffs. Paris continues to allow her to be a friend, through many grade panics and frets through the rest of the season. She also finds Rory teasing her by not revealing her PSAT grade, which annoyed her to no end. She also ends up visiting Stars Hollow several times throughout the year, first as a guest at a holiday dinner at the Independence Inn which she enjoyed despite what she thought were anachronisms, trying to score a story for the Franklin about the town's supposedly hidden dark side (at least until Kirk curtains off every non-G-rated movie in the town's video store behind a Rory Curtain, which Paris immediately jumps on for a story), and in a grade panic. With the departure of Tristan, there was no boy for Paris to be attracted to, and except for teasing a nerdy boy who got on her nerves sometimes (Brad Langford), she focused on her studies and building her college admissions chances. She also made a successful run for student body president in her senior year with Rory as her vice president towards the end of the season, and their reward is a two-month trip to Washington, DC for a Junior Leadership program. =Season 3= The third season begins towards the end of the Washington trip, with Rory and Paris as roommates and becoming very close. Paris is revealed to be a sleep talker in slumber, having dreams aloud about Woodward and Bernstein of Watergate and Washington Post fame, then dreaming of herself as Bill Clinton during his denial of having an affair with Monica Lewinsky. She finds romance at the conference with a boy named Jamie (Brandon Barash), who was often a partner with her in debates through the summer and took a liking to her assertive and commanding personality. This is proven as she tries to engage Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) in a debate, only to be passed onto a confused Rep. Doug Ose (R-CA) during a farewell luncheon. During the same luncheon, Jamie asks her to have dinner with him to celebrate, and she subconsciously accepts. Upon realizing that she has an actual date, Paris receives help from Rory while preparing. She later tries to hide the relationship from the gossip-happy circles of Chilton, and swears Rory to silence so she can date in peace. Rory, however, is forced to become a puppet to Paris' long-time rival in school and senior class president, Francine Jarvis. Francine had a vendetta against the two, thinking them the ones who had sabotaged the Puffs. Rory finds herself accidentally divulging Paris's dating status during a secret meeting with Francine. The set up for the secret meeting between Rory and Francine and the subsequent disclosure to Paris is remarkably similar to one of the plot lines in the 1981 movie, Absence of Malice starring Paul Newman and Sally Field. When Paris discovers that her relationship to Jamie has been made public, she confronts Rory in a ferocious fencing match during gym class. Feeling betrayed by Rory's revelation (whom by this point, Paris considered her best friend), the two are divided once again. Paris' family tradition was Harvard University (five generations according to her), and she had a complete meltdown on C-SPAN while she was supposed to be helping Rory deliver a co- written speech for the Chilton Bicentennial celebration in the wake of receiving a rejection letter from Harvard and losing her virginity to Jamie a few days earlier. Days before, Paris had told Rory first about her having sex, and the two reconciled, just in time as Rory was able to convince Paris that not getting into her dream college wasn't the end of the world. Rory, too, had intended to go to Harvard, but her infamous pro/con list came down on the side of Yale, partly because of Paris' rejection from the school, but mostly from the Gilmore family's Yale tradition. Rory would outrank Paris as valedictorian and Brad Langford (Adam Wylie) outranked her as salutatorian for Chilton's Class of 2003. Nanny and the rest of her family would see Paris walk down the aisle to receive her diploma, and though Paris joked that Rory would see bad luck in order to numb the fact she wasn't first in her class, she eventually accepted the fact. =Season 4= Rory walks into her Durfee Hall dormitory, surprised to find that not only has Paris decided to attend the school, but that Paris had her father exert his influence with the room assignments so that Paris and Rory would share a dorm. In their freshmen year they would share this room with two other girls, cross-country runner Janet Billings (Katie Walder) and Tana Schrick (Olivia Hack), a sixteen year-old child prodigy. She also hires a life coach named Terrence to deal with her emotions when her nanny can no longer take care of her, and takes up arts and crafts in an attempt to deal with her anger issues through calm activities. She ends her relationship suddenly and coldly with Jamie in the middle of her Yale freshman year, after commencing an affair with Professor Asher Fleming (Michael York) shortly after the Harvard-Yale Game. Professor Fleming was a sixty-year-old Yale literature professor and writer who was notorious for having flings and affairs with much younger women and was also a classmate of Rory's grandfather, Richard. Paris also experiences spring break with Rory on an impromptu trip to Florida caused by awful weather conditions and drenching rain in New Haven. The two girls bonded even closer, with Paris paying for the whole trip and their odd way of spending a vacation that involved watching a marathon of the PBS miniseries The Power of Myth in their hotel room with pizza and assorted junk food. Paris still finds herself bored, however, and learning that Madeline and Louise (coincidentally in the same resort on their spring break) kiss each other to draw attention prompts her to kiss Rory square on the mouth, not only to show she can be wild, but to have Rory gauge her kissing style. Rory wouldn't elaborate, only saying that Paris was not her type. She would become closer to Asher and fall in love with him despite Rory's frowning upon the relationship; still Rory helped her hide the relationship all year from the public. =Season 5= Professor Fleming dies of a heart attack while he and Paris are at Oxford University over the summer. Being his last lover, Paris ends up becoming the executor of his estate, much to chagrin of the Fleming family, who clash with her at every opportunity. She would acquire a large antique printing press as her inheritance from him, and for a while displayed it in the common area of her dorm room. In their sophomore year at Yale, Paris and Rory would share a dorm alone together, causing much discomfort for them both when either one of their boyfriends were present and they wanted individual privacy. In the middle of the fifth season, Paris started dating Doyle (Danny Strong), editor of the Yale Daily News after attempting speed dating and finding herself wanting more to talk to Doyle than the men at the event (Paris dismisses one of them upon hearing his first line of \\"Well I'm a drama major\\", by saying \\"Ding, ding, ding!!\\" to imitate the bell that ends a speed date). They would end up having sex hours later and start a relationship fraught with neurotic tendencies and competitiveness on both sides, but still love and mutual respect for one another. =Season 6= Paris finds herself struggling upon the start of her junior year, due to her parents fleeing the country because of the IRS pursuing them on tax fraud and tax evasion charges, exhausting all of her funds except for those in her trust fund and her Yale tuition. This forces her to help Rory out by taking a job with a DAR event where she was a server and having to take small loans from her friend. Rory later drops out of Yale due to personal frustrations. Afterward, an upset Paris goes to Lorelai for comfort several times throughout the summer, much to the derision of the Dragonfly Inn's staff, who consider her bossy and demanding. Lorelai continues to show sympathy for Paris, despite her intensity. When Rory finally goes back to Yale, Paris shows indifference to the happy news of her friend getting back to her old, competitive self, knowing Rory would have eventually realized how much she missed school and how it would make her dreams come true, along with proving Logan's father wrong. In the meantime, Paris becomes editor of the Yale Daily News, in preparation for Doyle's graduation, immediately instituting a quieter and less chaotic newsroom. The staff ends up resenting Paris's leadership and insists that Rory does something about her. Because of this grinding management style, the newspaper nearly misses a publication date, only making it to the press with a last-minute push by Rory to get it into the printer on time. In the end, the staff mutinies against Paris's behavior and chooses Rory as their new editor, ousting Paris. Paris and her boyfriend Doyle move into an apartment building in a more urban part of New Haven at the start of the semester, and eventually let Rory live with them. Paris takes measures to protect herself, including several door locks and chains on her apartment door, burglar alarms, and Krav Maga self-defense classes. When Paris hears that she had been ousted and replaced by Rory as Editor, she throws out all of Rory's belongings in an act of spite, forcing Rory to move in with Logan. After a few weeks, Paris returns to the Daily News, feeling defeated and down. Rory sympathizes with her, and suggests that Paris turn an article she was writing into a week-long series. When Rory learns that Logan has cheated on her, she leaves him and moves back in with Paris. Doyle moves out following a break-up with Paris, and the girls make up while enjoying television and Chinese food. They reconcile with their boyfriends in the following episode. =Season 7= The final season of the series starts with Paris using the Daily News office for the summer to run her own test preparation service, called \\"The Paris Geller Yale Review\\", to help students pass standardized and admissions exams, like the services provided by The Princeton Review and Kaplan, because she wants to cut out the middleman and collect the fees that would have otherwise gone to the company itself. She offers a position to Rory, who eventually takes on a student, and then they discuss Logan in London, with Paris warning he might stray without Rory nearby, going from past experience with Jamie and Logan's past with Rory. As the last semester of Yale begins, Paris begins to push Rory to take several opportunities for grants, interviews and other things of interest with her outside of their given fields under the banner Operation Finish Line (referring to graduation), such as oceanography and a Goldman Sachs interview in order to add extra experiences to each of their resumes. Again, Paris uses a whiteboard system to keep track of these various items for both her and Rory. She also took up yoga with Doyle in pursuit of adding to her life experiences, surprisingly enjoying it in the end. Later, she was annoyed when Logan, disassociated from his father's business interests and as a result lost his apartment, moved in without prior notice. After receiving a windfall of acceptance letters from both law and medical schools, Paris agonizes over the decision of which profession to choose, much less which school. She breaks up with Doyle because she is afraid to make a decision based on a relationship, but he insists that he will follow her, wherever Paris decides to go. Paris decides to attend Harvard Medical School, and then tours India with Doyle over the summer. At graduation, she tells Rory she'll miss her, although Rory again notes no matter what, Paris always finds a way to get back into her life. She then tells her best friend that she'll go on to do great things, and both of them embrace in a hug a little tight at Rory's end. Paris and Rory then graduate from Yale. =A Year in the Life= In the revival, it was revealed that she went into reproductive medicine, running a successful surrogacy/fertility clinic in New York known as Dynasty Makers, which Lorelai and Luke visit while considering having a child of their own. She has two children of her own with Doyle; a girl, Gabriela, and a boy, Tim√≥teo (likely named for the Brazilian city), though she is in the middle of a separation with Doyle (who has become a successful Hollywood screenwriter) over the course of her arc. She also still holds her crush on Tristan Dugrey, and upon seeing him from afar during a student day in Chilton, lashes out about not meeting the expectations of others. In an argument with Francine Jarvis a few moments later, it is revealed that she additionally passed the bar and has a law practice license, is an expert on classical architecture, and may also be a certified dental technician. She remains close to Rory, who occasionally rooms with her. In the media =Critical reception= Liza Weil, who portrayed Paris Paris has received generally positive reviews, with many critics feeling that she is most developed during the show's early seasons. Several writers have identified ambition as the core of Paris's character, noting that this creates a good deal of her wit, her resilience, and her eventual vulnerability as she bonds with others. In an article for Vulture, writer Jackson McHenry noted, \\"With Paris, Gilmore Girls insisted that ambitious women are compelling in their very ambition.\\" He described the character's struggles as \\"hilarious to watch\\", and declared that, in more dramatic scenes, \\"Paris tends to emerge from her challenges even stronger.\\" While comparing Paris to Rory, Keely Flaherty of BuzzFeed felt that Paris's tribulations made her \\"a far more relatable heroine for the masses.\\" Saba Hamedy of Mashable also found Paris's difficulties relatable, labeling the character \\"as real as it gets,\\" and declaring her \\"the true heroine of Gilmore Girls.\\" Due to her competitive nature, Paris initially feels antipathy toward Rory, whom she eventually comes to respect and befriend. Both characters develop as a result of this bond, particularly Paris, who reveals a gentler, more vulnerable side around Rory. A review for Autostraddle.com noted, \\"As the seasons progressed, it became clear how much they actually needed each other to grow and become the strong women they were [supposed] to be. Rory needed to grow a backbone and Paris needed to view the world as something other than a big test you either fail or ace.\\" Critical reviews typically claim that Paris is less developed in the later seasons, during which her scenes become briefer and centered on the school newspaper. In a commentary for Deadspin, Hannah Keyser noted that Paris was most humanized \\"early in the show\\". Reviews from Vulture and Bustle have stated that Season 3 contains Paris's best material, citing her disappointments, resilience, and friendship with Rory, while Vanity Fair claimed that Season 4 features \\"grade-A Paris\\". While commenting on the character's later appearances, Keyser stated, \\"Sherman-Palladino, it seems, is about as interested in the non-Gilmores of fictional New England as the titular ladies themselves are‚Äîwhich is to say: not very.\\" Some critics chastise the producers for continually having Rory succeed where Paris fails, calling these developments unrealistic. Others have criticized the spin-off for making Tristan a source of Paris's distress during its second episode. In a review for Vogue, Patricia Garcia declared, \\"Paris Geller wouldn't even remember Tristan's name, much less still care about him.\\" Kaitlyn Tiffany of The Verge concurred, noting, \\"Paris is 32 and wildly successful, and her crush, Tristan, was in seven episodes, max.\\" Additionally, certain reviewers believe that Paris represents a closeted lesbian, with some chastising the writers for not presenting her as openly gay. Molly McGowan of Rogues Portal felt that Rory and Paris were \\"obviously\\" in love at various points of the series. In a retrospective commentary, Brooke Camarda of Her Campus discussed Paris's determination, along with the layers it creates, stating, \\"Ambitious, painstaking, and brilliantly self-assured, Paris is the true MVP of the Gilmore Girls series.\\" =Comparisons to real politicians= Numerous journalists have drawn comparisons between Paris and the candidates of the 2016 United States presidential election, with most citing a scene from the 2002 second-season finale of Gilmore Girls. During the episode, Paris runs for Student Body President and learns that many voters consider her the most qualified candidate, but are hesitant to elect her for personal reasons. Several members of the media felt that this story paralleled Democrat Hillary Clinton's situation during the 2016 race. In 2017, Samantha Bee compared President Donald Trump to Paris Geller on an episode of TBS's Full Frontal, accusing him of showing favoritism in staffing choices. The Huffington Post responded, \\"We're not sure Paris ‚Äï who on the surface seemed pretentious, but was actually strong and caring ‚Äï would appreciate the comparison.\\" =LGBT following= Paris is a fan-favorite character among the LGBT community and writers, several of whom have wished to see her portrayed as a lesbian. Many writers note that she rarely has a long-term boyfriend, and affirm that her driven personality and powerful stature would represent the gay community well in a prominent work of fiction. In a review for AfterEllen.com, Trish Bendix stated, \\"Seriously, everything about Paris Geller is perfect. I love her. I want her to follow me around and yell at me about how stupid I am and how she could do everything better than I‚Äôm doing it and [then] have her angrily make out with me.\\" Following the premiere of A Year in the Life, in which Paris undergoes a distinctive change in appearance, Autostraddle declared that the character had become \\"a queer icon.\\" Reviewers from BuzzFeed concurred, calling Paris their \\"ultimate queer crush.\\" Loco Mag labeled Paris \\"the most obvious choice for 'revival lesbian'.\\" A review from The Niche noted, \\"Paris is far and away the most vivid, fully rendered, and realistic depiction of a lesbian that I have ever seen in any fictional medium,\\" but declared that the show-runners \\"were actively trying not to portray Paris as a lesbian.\\" Many writers have also expressed a specific interest in a romantic bond between Paris and Rory. In a 2016 interview, series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino revealed that the WB network did not allow her to depict characters as gay when the show premiered. =Relationship with Rory Gilmore= Paris's most prominent relationship is with Rory, who is initially her rival before the two grow closer. Peggy Truong of Cosmopolitan declared that Paris was Rory's \\"true constant\\" in the series. Shirley Li of The Atlantic wrote an extensive commentary on the girls' friendship. Writers have also shown interest in a potential romantic relationship between the characters. The romance novel Tell Me How You Really Feel, by Aminah Mae Safi, was partly inspired by Paris's bond with Rory. In 2016, Cassie Sheets wrote an article for Pride.com titled \\"10 TV Gal Pals Who Should've Been More Than Friends\\", listing Paris and Rory at number 1. Daniel Mallory Ortberg of The Toast posted a detailed article on their potential as lovers, while BuzzFeed's Cassie Smyth called their bond \\"the greatest romance of the 21st century.\\" Following the announcement of A Year in the Life, several journalists called for the creators to finally give Rory and Paris a committed romance.

Greer , Robert J. Grover, Susan G. Fowler, , pages 12-15 The versatile term 'information professional' is also used to describe other similar professions, such as archivists, information managers, information systems specialists, and records managers.Introduction to the Library and Information Professions, by Roger C. Greer , Robert J. Grover, Susan G. Fowler, , pages 12-15 Information professionals work in a variety of private, public, and academic institutions.  Skills  Since the term information professional is broad, the skills required for this profession are also varied. A Gartner report in 2011 pointed out that \\"Professional roles focused on information management will be different to that of established IT roles. An 'information professional' will not be one type of role or skill set, but will in fact have a number of specializations\\". Thus, an information professional can possess a variety of different skills, depending on the sector in which the person is employed. Some essential cross-sector skills are: * IT skills, such as word-processing and spreadsheets, digitisation skills, and conducting internet searches, together with skills in digitisation, loan systems, databases, content management systems, and specially designed programmes and packages. * Customer service. An information professional should have the ability to address the information needs of customers. * Language proficiency. This is essential in order to manage the information at hand and deal with customer needs. * Soft skills. These include skills such as negotiating, conflict resolution, and time management, which are useful for all interactions at a workplace. * Management training. An information professional should be familiar with notions such as strategic planning and project management. Moreover, an information professional should be skilled in planning and using relevant systems, in capturing and securing information, and in accessing it to deliver service whenever the information is required.  Qualifications  Many universities around the world offer academic degrees, or degrees on related subjects such as Archival Studies, Information Systems, Information Management, and Records Management. Furthermore, many library associations and unions offer Information Management training, and there are also online e-learning resources, some of which offer certification for information professionals. In many countries the courses and certificates available are accredited by the relevant professional association, as is the case for example with the American Library Association (ALA) in the USA, Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) in the UK, and Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA) in Australia. = Africa = Information development in Africa started later than in other continents, mainly due to a lack of internet access, and expertise and resources to manage digital infrastructure. Nowadays however, academic degrees in Information studies are available at many universities of African countries, such as the University of Pretoria (South Africa), University of Nairobi (Kenya), Makerere University (Uganda), University of Botswana (Botswana), and University of Nigeria (Nigeria). = Asia = LIS- related studies are available in more than 30 Asian countries. Some examples are: Information Science at Anhui University (China), Library and Information Science at the University of Kelaniya (Sri Lanka), Educational and Information Science at Fo Guang University (Taiwan), Library and Information Science at Airlangga University (Indonesia), Library and Information Science at University of Malaya (Malaysia), Library and Information Science at International Islamic University (Malaysia), and master's degree in Library and Information Science at Kuwait University (Kuwait). = Australia = The Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA) currently list 22 undergraduate and postgraduate accredited university courses for 'Librarian and Information Specialist' on their official website. = Europe = The majority of European countries have universities, colleges, or schools which offer bachelor's degrees in LIS studies. Over 40 universities offer master's degrees in LIS-related fields, and many institutions, such as the Swedish School of Library and Information Science (Sweden), the University of Barcelona (Spain), Loughborough University (UK), and Aberystwyth University (Wales, UK) also offer PhD degrees. = North America = Information studies and degrees are available at numerous academic institutions throughout the US and Canada. US professional associations, together with their European counterparts, have undertaken many educational initiatives and pioneered many advances in the field of Information studies, such as increased interdisciplinarity and more effective delivery of distance learning.Global , , pages 549 and 552 = South America = There are many schools and colleges in Latin American countries which offer courses in Library Science, Archival Studies, and Information Studies, however these subjects are taught completely separately.  Associations  Most countries have a professional association who oversee the professional and academic standards of librarians and information professionals. Some of these educational institutions refer to themselves as an iSchool, such as the CiSAP (Consortium of iSchools Asia Pacific) in Asia and the iSchool Caucus in the USA. There are also international associations related to LIS, the most prominent of which is the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA).

It is suspected to be the largest genus of agarics, containing over 2,000 widespread species. A common feature among all species in the genus Cortinarius is that young specimens have a cortina (veil) between the cap and the stem, hence the name, meaning curtained. Most of the fibres of the cortina are ephemeral and will leave no trace once gone, except for limited remnants on the stem or cap edge in some species. All have a rusty brown spore print. The common names cortinar and webcap refer to members of the genus. Due to dangerous toxicity of several species (such as Cortinarius orellanus) and the fact that it is difficult to distinguish between various species of the genus, non-expert consumption of mushrooms from the genus is discouraged. Distinguishing features The veil protects the gills in younger specimens and usually disappears leaving little to no trace of itself as the mushroom grows. The spores of a Cortinarius mushroom are rust brown to brownish red in color. It is usually possible to identify a mushroom as being a member of the genus, but extremely difficult to positively identify the species as many of the species are nearly identical. All mushrooms in this genus form mycorrhizae. Many mushrooms in the genus, for example Cortinarius sanguineus and other species in section Dermocybe, are colourful and are often used for dyeing. Toxicity Several mushrooms in the genus Cortinarius are poisonous, mainly because they cause acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. Some are even lethal, such as Cortinarius rubellus and Cortinarius orellanus. Therefore, a common rule when it comes to mushrooms from this genus is that none of them should be eaten. Many Cortinarius varieties can be mistaken for other edible mushrooms (such as the Blewit Mushroom) and should therefore be researched extensively before you consider ingesting a look alike of this genus. However, some species‚Äînotably the giant of the genus, Cortinarius praestans and the gypsy mushroom (Cortinarius caperatus)‚Äîare edible and appreciated in several European countries. The toxin in Cortinarius species, orellanine is easy to detect because it is fluorescent. It has been found in at least 34 Cortinariaceae. Classification Molecular studies of members of the genus Rozites, including its most famous member R. caperata, have shown them nested within Cortinarius and have been sunk into this genus. This genus was erected on the basis of a double veil, yet its members do not form a discrete lineage and lie nested within Cortinarius. Hence the genus is no longer recognised. Some consider the subgenus Dermocybe to have generic status. It does form a single lineage, but lies within Cortinarius so the consensus has been to sink it into the larger genus. Selected species *Cortinarius austrovenetus - also known as Dermocybe austroveneta or Green Skin-head is an Australian fungus typical of the brightly coloured Dermocybe subgenus. *Cortinarius caperatus, the \\"gypsy mushroom\\", is an edible mushroom found in northern regions of Europe and North America. *Cortinarius orellanus and C. rubellus are two of the deadly webcaps found in Europe and North America.

The equivalent injury to a ligament is a sprain.Fitness For Dummies p 60, Suzanne Schlosberg, Liz Neporent, For Dummies, 2005, Signs and symptoms Typical signs and symptoms of a strain include pain, functional loss of the involved structure, muscle weakness, contusion, and localized inflammation. A strain can range from mild annoyance to very painful, depending on the extent of injury. Cause A strain can occur as a result of improper body mechanics with any activity (e.g., contact sports, lifting heavy objects, overstretching) that can induce mechanical trauma or injury. Generally, the muscle or tendon overstretches and is placed under more physical stress than it can exert. Strains commonly result in a partial or complete tear of a tendon or muscle, or they can be severe in the form of a complete tendon rupture. The most common body location for strains to occur is in the foot, leg, or back. * Acute strains are more closely associated with recent mechanical trauma or injury. * Chronic strains typically result from repetitive movement of the muscles and tendons over a long period of time.

It is common for an injury to develop when there is a sudden increase in duration, intensity, or frequency of an activity. Treatment The first-line treatment for a muscular strain in the acute phase include five steps commonly known as P.R.I.C.E.T. A. J√§rvinen, et al., \\"Muscle injuries: optimising recovery\\" , Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol., 21 (2) April 2007, pp. 317-31. * Protection: Apply soft padding to minimize impact with objects. * Rest: Rest is necessary to accelerate healing and reduce the potential for re-injury. * Ice: Apply ice to induce vasoconstriction, which will reduce blood flow to the site of injury. Never ice for more than 20 minutes at a time. * Compression: Wrap the strained area with a soft-wrapped bandage to reduce further diapedesis and promote lymphatic drainage. * Elevation: Keep the strained area as close to the level of the heart as is possible in order to promote venous blood return to the systemic circulation. Immediate treatment is usually an adjunctive therapy of NSAIDs and Cold compression therapy. Cold compression therapy acts to reduce swelling and pain by reducing leukocyte extravasation into the injured area. NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen/paracetamol work to reduce the immediate inflammation by inhibiting Cox-1 & Cox-2 enzymes, which are the enzymes responsible for converting arachidonic acid into prostaglandin.TJ Noonan and WE Garrett, Jr, \\"Muscle strain injury: diagnosis and treatment,\\" Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 7 (4), July‚ÄìAugust 1999, pp. 262-9, see web version (accessed August 25, 2008) However, NSAIDs, including aspirin and ibuprofen, affect platelet function (this is why they are known as \\"blood thinners\\") and should not be taken during the period when tissue is bleeding because they will tend to increase blood flow, inhibit clotting, and thereby increase bleeding and swelling. After the bleeding has stopped, NSAIDs can be used with some effectiveness to reduce inflammation and pain. A new treatment for acute strains is the use of platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections which have been shown to accelerate recovery from non surgical muscular injuries. It is recommendedR. Neustaedter, \\"Natural Treatment for Injuries\\" (accessed August 25, 200 that the person injured should consult a medical provider if the injury is accompanied by severe pain, if the limb cannot be used, or if there is noticeable tenderness over an isolated spot.

Isaly's was a chain of family-owned dairies and restaurants started in Mansfield (Richland County), Ohio, with locations throughout the American Midwest from the early 20th century until the 1970s. It is known today for its iconic chipped chopped ham and for creating the famous Klondike Bar ice cream treat, popularized by the slogan \\"What would you do for a Klondike Bar?\\".  History  The company was founded by William Isaly, grandson of Swiss immigrants who settled in Monroe County, Ohio, in the 19th century. By the early 1960s, the company boasted retail outlets that stretched from Pennsylvania to Iowa. Isaly's early success was attributed to its loose company structure, which allowed for easy expansion without corporate overhead. William Isaly's first dairy was established in Mansfield, Ohio, where he acquired the Mansfield Pure Milk Company. Isaly expanded the core business from processing milk for sale to other grocers, to operating his own retail stores with milk, ice cream, bread and lunch counter service. Isaly also pioneered the idea of the modern convenience store by opening at least one outlet that also sold gasoline to motorists. The first expansion of the business took the company to Marion, Ohio, after acquiring the Marion Pure Milk Company in 1914. Operated by Charles Isaly, the Marion operation was quickly modernized, and business grew accordingly. From Marion, the company expanded to Youngstown, Ohio, and by 1918 had a dairy and new headquarters on Mahoning Ave. The Youngstown area was the largest Isaly's market, boasting at one time almost 130 stores. In 1929 they expanded to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (on the Blvd. of the Allies). Expansion continued through the 1930s and 1940s with additional dairies built from Columbus, Ohio (at North High Street and Arcadia Avenue) west to Iowa and 310 stores. Pittsburgh residents regarded Isaly's so highly that the company was and still is mistakenly considered a Pittsburgh original. In its advertising, the dairies used the mnemonic phrase \\"I Shall Always Love You Sweetheart\\" to help with the spelling of the Isaly‚Äôs name. In Marion, Ohio, Isaly's fielded an amateur basketball team that played against the Buffalo Silents ‚Äì a team composed of deaf/mute players and LaRue, Ohio-based World-Famous Indians with Jim Thorpe. In the 1930s, Isaly's began a commercial building program that employed high style art deco / Art Moderne designed production facilities and retail outlets, most of which were designed by architect Vincent (Shooey) Schoeneman. The Youngstown dairy facility represented the apex of this project, with the streamlined building (with exterior by architect Charles F. Owsley) dominated by a five-story glass block tower. In addition to the Klondike Bar, the dairies were also known for their unique Skyscraper Cones, created in Youngstown by plant supervisor Sam Jennings which eschewed round ice cream scoops, instead using a patented design that resulted in a long, inverse-cone-shaped dip. The company also had great success in selling chipped chopped ham, sliced (shaved) razor-thin for sandwiches. The sandwich was featured on the PBS special Sandwiches That You Will Like. The company also marketed \\"immunized milk for infants, supplied by special isolated herds of cattle.\\" Shifting consumer demands, declining sales for home-delivered milk, as well as corporate consolidation led to the closing of Isaly facilities beginning in the 1960s. According to Brian Butko, author of Klondikes, Chipped Ham, & Skyscraper Cones: The Story of Isaly's, it was the loose company structure ‚Äì in an era of growing corporate homogeneity ‚Äì that left Isaly's unable to compete on the wholesale and retail levels, leading to the closure of its dairies beginning in the mid-1960s. Several members of the Isaly family attempted to continue to operate food-service operations. In Pittsburgh, Isaly outlets were converted to the \\"Sweet William\\" brand. In Ohio, restaurants operated under the \\"Isaly Shoppe\\" name until the mid-1990s when the final outlet closed in Marion, Ohio. Since 1984, the Isaly's name has enjoyed a comeback of sorts, but one not overseen by members of the Isaly family. Delicatessen Distributing Incorporated of Evans City, Pennsylvania purchased the Isaly trademark name and markets the original quality luncheon meats, cheeses and sauces under the Isaly name in western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. The concern also distributes Isaly brand ice cream (except Klondikes) to stores in Western Pennsylvania. The Klondike Bar product line is now owned by Unilever. There are at least three Isaly's still in operation in southwestern Pennsylvania in the areas of West View, Turtle Creek, and East Allegheny (city neighborhood of Pittsburgh), all retaining most of the classic interior. In June 2012, ownership of the West View Isaly's changed hands. The new owners have kept everything in the store intact but slightly changed the name to \\"I Shall Always Love You Sweetie\\", reflecting on Isaly's acronym. To punctuate this, periods have been added after each letter in the classic Isaly's storefront. The Isaly's in Turtle Creek was recently renamed Turtle Creek Market, but still retains the Isaly's name on the front facade and most of the interior motif. A former Isaly's franchise in New Brighton, Pennsylvania, which operated under the name \\"Bricker's Restaurant\\" after its Isaly's contract ended and continued to serve much of the Isaly's menu, closed in 2012 but reopened in late 2016 under new ownership as a convenience store and cafe, Main Street Market.

Streptolysin, an exotoxin, is the enzyme produced by the bacteria which causes the complete lysis of red blood cells. There are two types of streptolysin: Streptolysin O (SLO) and streptolysin S (SLS). Streptolysin O is an oxygen-sensitive cytotoxin, secreted by most Group A streptococcus (GAS) and Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and interacts with cholesterol in the membrane of eukaryotic cells (mainly red and white blood cells, macrophages, and platelets), and usually results in Œ≤-hemolysis under the surface of blood agar. Streptolysin S is an oxygen-stable cytotoxin also produced by most GAS strains which results in clearing on the surface of blood agar. SLS affects immune cells, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes, and is thought to prevent the host immune system from clearing infection. Streptococcus pyogenes, or Group A beta-hemolytic Strep (GAS), displays beta hemolysis. Some weakly beta-hemolytic species cause intense beta hemolysis when grown together with a strain of Staphylococcus. This is called the CAMP test.The CAMP test is so called from the initials of those who initially described it, R. Christie, N. E. Atkins, and E. Munch-Peterson. It distinguishes Streptococcus agalactiae from the others. Streptococcus agalactiae displays this property. Clostridium perfringens can be identified presumptively with this test. Listeria monocytogenes is also positive on sheep's blood agar. =Gamma= If an organism does not induce hemolysis, the agar under and around the colony is unchanged, and the organism is called non- hemolytic or said to display gamma hemolysis (Œ≥-hemolysis). Enterococcus faecalis (formerly called \\"Group D Strep\\"), Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis display gamma hemolysis. Hemedigestion This is the nonspecific killing of blood cells by metabolic by-products of bacteria. This can be seen on a blood agar plate, when the blood surrounding the confluent part of your streak turns green, but there is no change around single colonies. Hemedigestion is seen with the cholera-causing bacteria, Vibrio cholerae. Notes References Kato, Gregory J.; Steinberg, Martin H.; Gladwin, Mark T.

For Hodgkin's it is often used together with vinblastine, bleomycin, and doxorubicin. It is given by injection into a vein. Common side effects include loss of appetite, vomiting, low white blood cell count, and low platelets. Other serious side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Dacarbazine is in the alkylating agent and purine analog families of medication. Dacarbazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1975. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses As of mid-2006, dacarbazine is commonly used as a single agent in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, and as part of the ABVD chemotherapy regimen to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma, and in the MAID regimen for sarcoma. Dacarbazine was proven to be just as efficacious as procarbazine in the German trial for paediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma, without the teratogenic effects. Thus COPDAC has replaced the former COPP regime in children for TG2 & 3 following OEPA. Side effects Like many chemotherapy drugs, dacarbazine may have numerous serious side effects, because it interferes with normal cell growth as well as cancer cell growth. Among the most serious possible side effects are birth defects to children conceived or carried during treatment; sterility, possibly permanent; or immune suppression (reduced ability to fight infection or disease). Dacarbazine is considered to be highly emetogenic, and most patients will be pre-medicated with dexamethasone and antiemetic drugs like 5-HT3 antagonist (e.g., ondansetron) and/or NK1 receptor antagonist (e.g., aprepitant). Other significant side effects include headache, fatigue and occasionally diarrhea. The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare has sent out a black box warning and suggests avoiding dacarbazine due to liver problems. Mechanism of action Dacarbazine works by methylating guanine at the O-6 and N-7 positions. Guanine is one of the four nucleotides that makes up DNA. The methylated DNA strands stick together such that cell division becomes impossible. This affects cancer cells more than healthy cells because cancer cells divide faster. Unfortunately however, some of the healthy cells will still be damaged. Dacarbazine is bioactivated in liver by demethylation to \\"MTIC\\" and then to diazomethane, which is an alkylating agent.

Fulmer Shealy, PhD at Southern Research Institute in Birmingham, Alabama. Research was funded by a U.S. federal grant. Dacarbazine gained FDA approval in May 1975 as DTIC-Dome. The drug was initially marketed by Bayer. Suppliers Bayer continues to supply DTIC-Dome.

The Regency was governed by beylerbeys, pashas, aghas and deys, and was composed of various beyliks (provinces) under the authority of beys (vassals): Constantine in the east, Medea in the Titteri and Mazouna, then Mascara and then Oran in the west. Each beylik was divided into various outan (counties) with at their head the ca√Øds directly under the bey. To administer the interior of the country, the administration relied on the tribes said makhzen. These tribes were responsible for securing order and collecting taxes on the tributary regions of the country. It was through this system that, for three centuries, the State of Algiers extended its authority over the north of Algeria. However, society was still divided into tribes and dominated by maraboutics brotherhoods or local djouads (nobles). Several regions of the country thus only lightly recognised the authority of Algiers. Throughout its history, they formed numerous revolts, confederations, tribal fiefs or sultanates that fought with the regency for control. Before 1830, out of the 516 political units, a total of 200 principalities or tribes were considered independent because they controlled over 60% of the territory in Algeria and refused to pay taxes to Algiers. History =Establishment= Ottoman Algeria in 1560. From 1496, the Spanish conquered numerous possessions on the North African coast, which had been captured since 1496: Melilla (1496), Mers El K√©bir (1505), Oran (1509), Bougie (1510), Tripoli (1510), Algiers, Shershell, Dellys, and Tenes.An Historical Geography of the Ottoman Empire p.107ff Around the same time, the Ottoman privateer brothers Oru√ß and Hayreddin‚Äîboth known to Europeans as Barbarossa, or \\"Red Beard\\"‚Äîwere operating successfully off Tunisia under the Hafsids. In 1516, Oru√ß moved his base of operations to Algiers and asked for the protection of the Ottoman Empire in 1517, but was killed in 1518 during his invasion of the Kingdom of Tlemcen. Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers.‚Üë Kamel Filali, L'Alg√©rie mystique : Des marabouts fondateurs aux khw√¢n insurg√©s, XVe-XIXe si√®cles, Paris, Publisud, coll. ¬´ Espaces m√©diterran√©ens ¬ª, 2002, 214 p. (), p. 56 =Occupation of Algiers= Barbarossa was the founder of the Regency of Algiers. Oru√ß, Hayreddin Barbarossa's brother, captured Algiers in 1516, apart from the Spanish Pe√±√≥n of Algiers. Following the death of Oru√ß in 1518 at the hand of the Spanish in the Fall of Tlemcen, Barbarossa requested the assistance of the Ottoman Empire, in exchange for acknowledging Ottoman authority in his dominions. Before Ottoman help could arrive, the Spanish retook the city of Algiers in 1519. Barbarossa recaptured the city definitively in 1525, and in 1529 the Spanish Pe√±on in the capture of Algiers. =Base in the war against Spain= Hayreddin Barbarossa established the military basis of the regency. The Ottomans provided a supporting garrison of 2,000 Turkish troops with artillery. He left Hasan Agha in command as his deputy when he had to leave for Constantinople in 1533. The son of Barbarossa, Hasan Pashan was in 1544 when his father retired, the first governor of the Regency to be directly appointed by the Ottoman Empire. He took the title of beylerbey. Algiers became a base in the war against Spain, and also in the Ottoman conflicts with Morocco. Beylerbeys continued to be nominated for unlimited tenures until 1587. After Spain had sent an embassy to Constantinople in 1578 to negotiate a truce, leading to a formal peace in August 1580, the Regency of Algiers was a formal Ottoman territory, rather than just a military base in the war against Spain. At this time, the Ottoman Empire set up a regular Ottoman administration in Algiers and its dependencies, headed by Pashas, with 3-year terms to help considate Ottoman power in the Maghreb. =Mediterranean Privateer= Religieux de la Mercy de France) in Algiers in 1662 Despite the end of formal hostilities with Spain in 1580, attacks on Christian and especially Catholic shipping, with slavery for the captured, became prevalent in Algiers and were actually the main industry and source of revenues of the Regency. In the early 17th century, Algiers also became, along with other North African ports such as Tunis, one of the bases for Anglo-Turkish piracy. There were as many as 8,000 renegades in the city in 1634. (Renegades were former Christians, sometimes fleeing the law, who voluntarily moved to Muslim territory and converted to Islam.) Hayreddin Barbarossa is credited with tearing down the Pe√±√≥n of Algiers and using the stone to build the inner harbor. A contemporary letter states: Privateer and slavery of Christians originating from Algiers were a major problem throughout the centuries, leading to regular punitive expeditions by European powers. Spain (1567, 1775, 1783), Denmark (1770), France (1661, 1665, 1682, 1683, 1688), England (1622, 1655, 1672), all led naval bombardments against Algiers. Abraham Duquesne fought the Barbary pirates in 1681 and bombarded Algiers between 1682 and 1683, to help Christian captives. =Danish‚ÄìAlgerian War= In the mid-1700s Dano-Norwegian trade in the Mediterranean expanded. In order to protect the lucrative business against piracy, Denmark‚ÄìNorway had secured a peace deal with the states of Barbary Coast. It involved paying an annual tribute to the individual rulers and additionally to the States. In 1766, Algiers had a new ruler, dey Baba Mohammed ben-Osman. He demanded that the annual payment made by Denmark-Norway should be increased, and he should receive new gifts. Denmark‚ÄìNorway refused the demands. Shortly after, Algerian pirates hijacked three Dano-Norwegian ships and allowed the crew to be sold as slaves. They threatened to bombard the Algerian capital if the Algerians did not agree to a new peace deal on Danish terms. Algiers was not intimidated by the fleet, the fleet was of 2 frigates, 2 bomb galiot and 4 ship of the line. = Algerian-Sharifian War = In the west, the Algerian-Cherifian conflicts will shape the western border of Algeria. =Barbary Wars= Bombardment of Algiers in 1816, by Martinus Schouman Ottoman Algeria in the 18th century. During the early 19th century, the Ottoman Algiers again resorted to widespread piracy against shipping from Europe and the young United States of America, mainly due to internal fiscal difficulties. This in turn led to the First Barbary War and Second Barbary Wars, which culminated in August 1816 when Lord Exmouth executed a naval Bombardment of Algiers.Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors). Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage (1990 edition). New York: St Martin's Press, 199 The Barbary Wars resulted on a major victory for the American Navy. =French invasion= During the Napoleonic Wars, the Regency of Algiers had greatly benefited from trade in the Mediterranean, and of the massive imports of food by France, largely bought on credit by France. In 1827, Hussein Dey, Algeria's Ottoman ruler, demanded that the French pay a 31-year-old debt contracted in 1799 by purchasing supplies to feed the soldiers of the Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt. The French consul Pierre Deval refused to give answers satisfactory to the dey, and in an outburst of anger, Hussein Dey touched the consul with his fan. Charles X used this as an excuse to break diplomatic relations. The Regency of Algiers would end with the French invasion of Algiers in 1830, followed by subsequent French rule for the next 132 years. Political status Map of The Ottoman Empire in 1609 highlighting the political status of the Regency as an vassal state. After its conquest by Turks, Algeria became a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. The Regency was successively governed by Beylerbeys (1518‚Äì70), Pachas (1570‚Äì1659), Aghas (1659‚Äì71), then Deys (1671‚Äì1830), on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan. Until 1671, Beylerbeys, Pachas and Aghas were appointed by the Ottoman sultan and were subjucted to him. After a coup in 1671, the Regency acquired a large degree of autonomy and became a military republic, ruled in the name of the Ottoman sultan by Deys, officers chosen either by the Ottoman militia or the Captains.Saliha Belmessous, Assimilation and Empire: Uniformity in French and British Colonies, 1541-1954, Oxford University Press, 2013 (), p.119 : From 1718 onwards, Deys were elected by the Divan, an assembly aimed to represent the interests of both Captains and Janissaries. Demography Map of the Regency of Algiers in 1829. As of 1808, the population of the Regency of Algiers numbered around 3 million people, of whom 10,000 were 'Turks' (including people from Kurdish, Greek and Albanian ancestry) and 5,000 Kouloughlis (from the Turkish kul oƒülu, \\"son of slaves (Janissaries)\\", i.e. creole of Turks and local women). By 1830, more than 17,000 Jews were living in the Regency.

In 1835 a Scottish immigrant from Kirkudbright Scotland named Samuel Anderson sailed up the Bass River and established the third permanent settlement in Victoria he was joined in 1837 by Robert Massie. Samuel had arrived in Hobart in 1830 aboard the Lang and took up a position as bookkeeper at Circular Head with Van Diemen's Land Company before setting out for Western Port in September 1835.

All power plants, coal, gas, and nuclear, have a finite life beyond which it is no longer economical to operate them. At this point they must be decommissioned; that is, they must be dismantled and their components disposed of either by sale or scrapping. In some cases the buildings that housed the plant may be put to other uses. However, in many cases contamination is unacceptable and the buildings must be demolished. The land on which the plant sat also may have been polluted with high levels of toxins, and in this case other remedial measures like removal and replacement of the top soil or clay capping may be required to render the site safe in perpetuity. It is becoming standard practice in many jurisdictions to mandate a return to greenfield status at the end of plant service as a condition of the initial site license, and potential licensees must demonstrate that steps will be taken to assure the availability of funds via the posting of a reclamation bond for that task before a site-license will be issued.

As such, Wheatley is home to many fisheries owned and operated by local families. Hike Metal Products, a shipbuilding/refitting/fabricating company based at the harbour, is the builder of the Maid of the Mist, the vessel used at Niagara Falls for the tours under the great Canadian waterfall. It also built the 141-foot Copasetic, a research vessel, as well as a ferry for the Toronto Island Airport, to take passengers and vehicles from downtown Toronto to the Toronto Islands.  History  Prior to the arrival of white settlers, the area was home to a population of aboriginals known as Neutrals, an Iroquoian tribe of the south.http://www.soto.on.ca/canadas_most_southern_point/wheatley.html The Indigenous Neutrals were experts in carving arrowheads, spear points, and tomahawks. The flint beds located along the shores of Lake Erie were the source of the hard-stone building materials. The year 1818 saw the beginning of construction of the southwestern portion of Talbot Road. Col. Burwell, the chief surveyor, was hired by Col. Thomas Talbot (a British officer and land developer) to supervise the construction of the road which eventually stretched over three-hundred miles along the shoreline of Lake Erie. Following the completion of the road, settlers arrived and began taking up crown lands. The first settler, Wheatley, arrived from England.http://www.soto.on.ca/canadas_most_southern_point/wheatley.html Wheatley had been named \\"Pegtown\\" prior to the arrival of its first permanent settler Richard Wheatley who built a home on lot 218 Talbot trail in 1832.http://wheatleyhome.weebly.com/wheatley-facts-and-oddities.htmlMeridian Reservation Systems International Subject to copyright, 2015 He was proceeded by such families as the Derbyshire's, Lamarsh's, Julien's and Ivison's most of whom can be found in directories and on local street signs in the area.

The origin of the name remain unclear as other theories exist. The name \\"Pegtown\\" was eventually discarded as Richard Wheatley's son in law, William Buchanan opened a post office (1865) and renamed the town in honor of its first permanent resident.http://wheatleyhome.weebly.com/wheatley-facts-and- oddities.htmlMeridian Reservation Systems International Subject to copyright, 2015 In 1913, the existing political structure of the village was deemed outdated.

Its audacity is sometimes overstated‚Äì Oregon's attorney general filed a traditional companion brief that cited the needed legal precedents. Some of the scientific evidence detailed in the Brandeis Brief was later challenged and refuted. But it still is regarded as a pioneering attempt in combining law and social science. The Brandeis Brief changed the direction of the Supreme Court and of U.S. law. It is considered a model for future Supreme Court presentations in cases affecting the health or welfare of classes of individuals. This strategy of combining legal argument with scientific evidence was later successfully used in Brown v. Board of Education to demonstrate the harmful psychological effects of segregated education on African-American children.

Later manufactured by Schweizer Aircraft, and currently produced by Schweizer RSG, the basic design has been in production for over 50 years. The single, three-bladed main rotor and piston-powered S300 is mostly used as a cost-effective platform for training and agriculture. Development =Background= In 1955, Hughes Tool Company's Aircraft Division (later Hughes Helicopters) carried out a market survey showing that there was a demand for a low-cost, lightweight, two-seat helicopter. The division began building the Model 269 in September 1955. The prototype flew on 2 October 1956, but it was not until 1960 that the decision was made to develop the helicopter for production. On 9 April 1959, the 269 received certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Hughes continued to concentrate on civil production. With some design changes, deliveries of the Model 269A version began in 1961. By mid-1963 about 20 aircraft were being produced per month, and by the spring of 1964 314 had been built. Hughes had successfully captured a large portion of the civilian helicopter market with an aircraft that would prove popular in agriculture, police work and other duties. =Model 300= Schweizer 300C Schweizer 300CB on hangar dolly In 1964, Hughes introduced the slightly larger three-seat Model 269B which it marketed as the Hughes 300. That same year, the Hughes 269 set an endurance record of 101 hours. To set the record, two pilots took turns piloting the aircraft and hovered in ground-effect for fueling. To ensure no cheating, eggs were attached to the bottom of the skid gear to register any record-ending landing. The Hughes 300 was followed in 1969 by the improved Hughes 300C (sometimes 269C), which first flew on 6 March 1969 and received FAA certification in May 1970. This new model introduced a more powerful 190 hp (140 kW) Lycoming HIO-360-D1A engine and increased rotor diameter, giving a payload increase of 45%, plus overall performance improvements. It was this model that Schweizer began building under license from Hughes in 1983. In 1986, Schweizer acquired all rights to the helicopter from McDonnell Douglas, which had purchased Hughes Helicopters in 1984. After Schweizer acquired the FAA Type Certificate, the helicopter was known for a short time as the Schweizer-Hughes 300C and then simply, the Schweizer 300C. The basic design remained unchanged over the years, despite Schweizer making over 250 minor improvements. Schweizer was purchased on August 26, 2004 by Sikorsky Aircraft. The Schweizer 300 models fill a gap in the Sikorsky helicopter line, which is known for its medium and heavy utility and cargo helicopters. In February 2009, the 300C was rebranded as the Sikorsky S-300C. In 2018 the type certificate for the 269/300 product line was sold by Sikorsky to Schweizer RSG in Fort Worth Texas. The new company, affiliated with Rotorcraft Services Group, will support the existing fleet and will start to build new aircraft at Meacham Airport in Fort Worth, Texas. The management team includes industry and product veterans such as David Horton and Mike Iven. =Derivatives= Between Hughes and Schweizer, and including foreign-licensed production civil and military training aircraft, nearly 3,000 units of the Model 269/300 have been built and flown over the last 50 years. Schweizer continued to develop the Model 300 by adding a turbine and redesigning the body to create the Schweizer 330. Further developing the dynamic components to take greater advantage of the power of the turbine engine led to the development of the Schweizer S-333. In recent years the cockpit received an upgrade when an STC was developed for the installation of the Garmin G500H helicopter dual-screen electronic flight display, as well as the Mid-Continent MD302 Standby Attitude Indicator. Design The Hughes 269 was created with a fully articulated three-bladed main rotor wherein the blades advance to the right and a two- bladed tail rotor that would remain as distinctive characteristics of all its variants. It also has shock absorber-damped, skid-type landing gear. The flight controls are directly linked to the control surfaces of the helicopter so there are no hydraulics in the 269. There are generally two sets of controls, although this was optional on the civil 269A. For three-seat aircraft, the middle collective control stick is removable and a seat cushion can be put in its place for the third passenger. In the 300CB and 300CBi, the collective control can be repositioned to left-handed configuration for the Pilot In Command position (right seat).

The larger rotor and engine gives it a 45% performance increase over previous 269-series models. Hughes and Schweizer both marketed the 269C as the Model 300C. ;300CQ :The Sky Knight is a purpose- built 300C for urban police helicopter patrols with a muffler and other noise attenuating materials and design changes to reduce the helicopter's noise signature by 75%. ;300CB :The 300CB is the first pure production of the 300 by Schweizer and is powered by a Textron Lycoming HO-360-C1A, 180 hp engine.

Hercules and the Dragon Ladon, from the workshop of Giambologna, early 17th century (Walters Art Museum). Ladon (Greek: ŒõŒ¨Œ¥œâŒΩ; gen.: ŒõŒ¨Œ¥œâŒΩŒøœÇ Ladonos) is a monster in Greek mythology. Mythology Ladon was the serpent-like dragon that twined and twisted around the tree in the Garden of the Hesperides and guarded the golden apples. He was overcome by Heracles by a bow that he had. The following day, Jason and the Argonauts passed by on their chthonic return journey from Colchis and heard the lament of \\"shining\\" Aegle, one of the four Hesperides, and viewed the still-twitching Ladon.Argonautica, Book IV. Though in other versions Ladon is never slain and Heracles instead gets the Titan god Atlas to aid him in retrieving the apples by taking the sky from him and having Atlas fetch them in his stead. Ladon was given several parentages, each of which placed him at an archaic level in Greek myth: the offspring of \\"Ceto, joined in heated passion with Phorcys\\"Hesiod. Theogony, 333. or of Typhon, who was himself serpent-like from the waist down, and Echidna.Bibliotheke 2.113; Hyginus, Preface to Fabulae. \\"The Dragon which guarded the golden apples was the brother of the Nemean lion\\" asserted Ptolemy Hephaestion.Recorded in his New History V, lost but epitomized in Photius, Myriobiblion 190. The image of the dragon (Ladon) coiled round the tree, originally adopted by the Hellenes from Near Eastern and Minoan sources, is familiar from surviving Greek vase- painting. In the 2nd century CE, Pausanias saw among the treasuries at Olympia an archaic cult image in cedar-wood of Heracles and the apple-tree of the Hesperides with the dragon coiled around it.Pausanias. Description of Greece, 6.19.8. Diodorus Siculus gives an euhemerist interpretation of Ladon, as a human shepherd guarding a flock of golden-fleeced sheep, adding \\"But with regards to such matters it will be every man‚Äôs privilege to form such opinions as accord with his own belief\\".Diodorus Siculus, 4.26.2. Ladon is the constellation Draco according to Hyginus' Astronomy.Hyginus Theoi.com: Hyginus, \\"Astronomica 1\\" translated by Mary Grant Ladon is the Greek version of the West Semitic serpent Lotan, or the Hurrian serpent Illuyanka. He might be given multiple heads, a hundred in Aristophanes' The Frogs (a passing remark in line 475), which might speak with different voices.

He was created by Naughty Dog Inc, and made cross- over appearances in PlayStation Move Heroes and PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, serving as one of three protagonists in the game former. From his introduction in Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy to the last Naughty Dog- developed game Jak X: Combat Racing, Jak was voiced by Mike Erwin. In the High Impact Games-developed Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier and PlayStation All- Stars Battle Royale, he was voiced by Josh Keaton. Throughout the series, Jak's gameplay carried signature platformer attributes. The character has the ability to channel \\"eco\\", a powerful substance of multiple colors and varying specialties, giving the player an array of powers to help battle enemies. Character development Initial character design began in the year 2000, when Naughty Dog commissioned various artists to \\"scribble characters\\" for their next PlayStation 2 title. After several revisions, from wolf-like characters to various human concepts, Naughty Dog animator John Kim drew a concept of a \\"tall, slender, and agile\\" character that \\"sported jaunty, spiky hair,\\" with an \\"exaggeration, weight, and thickness\\" that Kim described as \\"BAM!\\"; an internal mantra that served to describe the characteristics of the new personalities in the title. Bob Rafei proceeded with this concept and designed various concept art poses that would eventually depict a 15-year-old boy with spiky green-blond hair, blue tunic, and athletic physical attributes. Jak's character was described to have a clear \\"racer\\" design, sporting goggles and other aviator's equipment throughout the series. In the first game, Jak was featured as a mute teenage boy, quiet and headstrong, with a sober attitude who \\"has yet to realize his potential.\\" He had a brave and adventurous personality, much to the frustration of his watchover Samos Hagai, spending most of his time with his equally trouble-making but much less brave best friend Daxter. However, Jak's character would take on a much more mature tone in the following game, when he was thrust into the future and imprisoned for two years, subjected to repeated \\"dark eco\\" treatments. He gained a significant personality shift in this game, vengeance-stricken and jaded by the experiments. He was also no longer a mute, a conscious decision made by Naughty Dog to give the character more dialog. Jak was described during this game as a \\"brooding emo figure,\\" due to his torture and sole mission to exact revenge on Baron Praxis (the conductor of the experiment and tyrannical ruler of Haven City). However, later in Jak 3, Jak matured and regained his fiery head-on attitude reminiscent from the first game. Albeit frustrated and distrusting, being cast to the Wasteland and betrayed by his city, he was more still collected and calculated. He also gained a \\"Light Jak\\" form to balance the dark mode that was imbued in him by the experiments a year prior, which aided in controlling his dark personality. Towards the end of the game, after saving the world from the \\"Dark Makers\\", and in The Lost Frontier, Jak was displayed as fully mature, adventurous, and rational. Jak was described by former Naughty Dog creative director as \\"the hero you want to be ... the stellar guy who is going to make it happen, who is going to save the world.\\" Appearances =The Precursor Legacy= Jak debuted in The Precursor Legacy at 15 years old, along with his best friend Daxter of the same age. Their adventures started when Daxter fell into a dark eco silo while exploring a forbidden island, against Samos' permission. When they returned for help, they discovered that they would have to travel far north to reach the sage of dark eco, Gol Acheron, for the hope that he only might be able to change him back. From thereafter Jak used his athletic abilities, \\"vehicular prowess\\", and unique capability of channeling eco to traverse various environments and collect power cells to further northern progress. When the group reached Volcanic Crater, Gol Acheron and his sister Maia Acheron appeared, and revealing their corrupt state, disclosed that they were behind the lurker attacks and the kidnapping of the other eco sages. The mission of the game then centered towards stopping Gol and Maia and freeing the captive sages, which Jak succeeded in doing, resulting in the death of the evil siblings. Throughout the game it was clear to the player that Jak and Samos' daughter Keira shared romantic interest, which would develop later in the series. As previously mentioned, Jak had the rare ability to channel eco, as well as capabilities flying over dangerous terrain in the \\"A-Grav Zoomer\\". Together with Samos' wisdom, Jak and Daxter were able to save the world from complete destruction, with Samos finally admitting that the Jak and Daxter duo were destined heroes. =Jak II= After collecting 101 power cells in the first game, Jak opened a large Precursor door on top of Gol and Maia's Citadel, behind of which lied the Rift Rider and Rift Gate. When they moved it back to Samos' hut, Jak, Daxter, Samos, and Keira were teleported into the future in a dystopia known as Haven City. Jak was almost immediately apprehended by the \\"Krimzon Guard\\" on account of his special powers, making him a prime prospect for the \\"Dark Warrior Program\\". After two years of being subjected to torturing experiments, Jak was finally rescued by Daxter. After Jak escaped from the prison, he sought out a figure known as the \\"Shadow\\", the leader of a rebel movement known as the \\"Underground\\", waging war against the misplaced rule of Baron Praxis. After carrying out multiple tasks for Underground leader Torn, Jak finally became acquainted with the Shadow. After further revelation, Jak realized he was in the future, and that the Shadow was a younger version of Samos who had yet to be sent into the past (Sandover Village). It was also realized that \\"the Kid\\", a royal descendant of the House of Mar and the subject of the Underground movement, was younger Jak. Young Samos and young Jak were then sent into the past using a replica of the original Rift Rider, built by Keira, starting over the journey described in the first game. Before this, however, Jak fulfilled the prophecy in killing Kor, the ancient leader of an antagonistic race known as the \\"Metal Heads\\", thus saving Haven City and becoming a hero. =Jak 3= Jak and Daxter (left) speaking to Damas (right). Before Kor's death, a crime lord known as Krew sabotaged Haven City's security walls and allowed metal head forces into the city. Jak was well known as Krew's heavy, and despite knowing that Jak later killed Krew, the city's high council found him guilty in association (though this was only due to the corruption that still existed from the time of Baron Praxis' rule).Ashelin: The Council's meeting tonight in emergency session. Rumblings about you, Jak. It doesn't look good. They think your friendship with Krew helped the Metal Heads get into the city. Jak: You don't believe that do you? ‚Äì Naughty Dog Inc (2003) \\"Jak 3\\" Sony Computer Entertainment Level/area: Prologue (Flashback) The new governor of the city, Ashelin Praxis (the Baron's daughter), objected to the verdict, but her protest was overruled by council chairman Count Veger.Veger: By order of the Grand Council of Haven City, for heinous acts and crimes against the people, you are hereby banished to the Wasteland for life. Ashelin: This is a death sentence, Veger. There must be another way. Veger: Your protest was overruled! This dark eco freak is dangerous! Now drop the cargo! ‚Äì Naughty Dog Inc (2003) \\"Jak 3\\" Sony Computer Entertainment Level/area: Prologue As a result, Jak was banished to the Wasteland, with Daxter and Pecker volunteering to stick with Jak. Before departure, Ashelin Praxis handed Jak a homing beacon, which king Damas of the Wasteland city of Spargus used find him. Damas took Jak into his palace to recuperate, and when Jak woke up, the king made him prove his worth in arena battles. Jak eventually won enough battles to be titled an official \\"Wastelander\\", and was described by Damas to be \\"one of [his] finest warriors.\\"Damas: Our minds think alike. My monks say the world is coming to an end, but I am a survivor. I say we live on long after this world dies! Be ready. You are shaping up to be one of my finest warriors, and I'll need you for the trials ahead. I mustn't lose you... like I lost my son. ‚Äì Naughty Dog Inc (2003) \\"Jak 3\\" Sony Computer Entertainment Level/area: Defend Spargus' Front Gate Eventually Jak was invited back to Haven City to help with the war effort. Initially Jak refused, as he was bitter towards being betrayed by his city, but with the oncoming of the \\"Dark Makers\\" and the ongoing threats at Haven, he decided it best to reconnect with his allies. While there, he defended a Freedom League headquarters twice from KG Death Bot attacks, and he and Daxter were also able to reconnect the southern HQ to the northern HQ, as they had been blocked off from one another by KG Death Bot territorial barriers. After confronting Cyber Errol, leader of the KG Death Bots, the resurgent metal heads, and communicator with the Dark Makers, Jak managed to destroy the KG war factory that mass-produced the death bots. This, together with Errol's ultimate defeat in the Wasteland, helped Haven emerge victorious and Jak was once again acknowledged as savior of the city. He also saved the world by activating the Planetary Defense System at the fabled \\"Precursor Core\\" to destroy the Dark Makers' ship that threatened to ruin the planet. Afterwards, Jak was invited by the Precursors to explore his universe, though Jak declined in favor of staying with Daxter, just as had happened vice versa in the beginning of the game. During the game, Damas was revealed to be Jak's father. Young Jak, that had been sent into the past in the second game, was revealed to be Damas' son by the king in his dying moments. Just after Damas' final breath, Jak realized the relationship, which Veger confirmed. In the following games, Jak X: Combat Racing and The Lost Frontier, Jak can be heard uttering \\"this is for Damas!\\" at various points in the story. =Jak X: Combat Racing= A year after the War for Haven City, Jak, Daxter, Keira, Ashelin, and Torn were invited to Kras City to read the final will of the late ganglord Krew. There, they met Krew's daughter Rayn. Krew's holographic will described that the drinks they had just consumed as a toast were poisoned, and that the only way to win the antidote is to win the Kras City Grand Championship in the sport of combat racing. After several races, including death matches, lap races, and other types of events, Jak eventually won the entire race, to the frustration of the ganglords that ran the sport under ground. The group won the antidote and were saved, and Rayn was revealed to be partially behind it the whole time. Rayn escaped and the group returned to Haven. =The Lost Frontier= After an unknown amount of time following the events of Jak X: Combat Racing, Jak's planet had suddenly stopped producing eco, the lifeblood of the entire universe. Jak, Daxter, and Keira began a quest on the other side of the world at a place known as the Brink in search of a new source of eco. While there, they met a band of Eco Pirates who were in a war with the Aeropans. After realizing the Aeropan's corruption, the group sided with the Eco Pirates. They eventually acquired the Eco Sphere and all of its components, which was said to point to any major source of eco. It eventually led them to the Eco Core, which they were able to stabilize and return energy to the planet, stopping the \\"eco storms\\" that threatened to \\"tear the world apart.\\" Jak also destroyed the Aeropans in their conquest for dark eco (so as to shape the world to their liking), not dissimilar from Gol and Maia and Cyber Errol defeated in previous games. After re-stabilization, Jak and Keira decided to explore the Brink and beyond. =Other games= In the spin-off game Daxter, in which Daxter was the main protagonist, Jak appeared a few times for plot continuity. He also, often along with Daxter, appeared as a cameo in many other games, including Ratchet & Clank, Hot Shots Golf Fore!, and the Naughty Dog-developed games Uncharted and The Last of Us. He also appeared as a playable character in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale and PlayStation Move Heroes. Reception Jak's character received positive reception. He was listed 26th on the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 's \\"Top 50 Characters of All Time\\", and in a poll conducted by Game Informer, Jak was voted 28 in the top 30 video game characters of the decade.

Under democracy in ancient Greece, only free adult Greek males were enfranchised as full citizens. Women, foreigners, children and slaves were not full citizens; they could not vote or hold public office, and they had to have adult males act as guardians of their property and other interests. A man who was made atimos, literally meaning without honour or value, was likewise disenfranchised and disempowered, making him unable to carry out the political functions of a citizen. He could not attend assembly meetings, serve as a juror in Heliaia or bring actions before the courts. Being barred from assembly would effectively end a citizen's political ambition. Not being able to use the courts to defend oneself against enemies could be socially crippling. It also meant the loss of the small income that jury service and attendance at the assembly provided, which could be significant for poor people unable to work. Atimia could be inflicted as a penalty by the courts for crimes such as bribery, embezzlement, false witness, and breach of duty as a public officer. A temporary form of atimia was automatically imposed if a debt to the state was unpaid after a certain time, for instance if someone was unable to pay a fine. There was no upper limit on the fines courts could impose and they could well be larger than a person's entire estate. Just as this debt was inheritable, so was the status.http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063:id=atimia- cn Failure to abide by atimia was seen as an attack on the power of the people, represented by the courts that had imposed it.

Technically, Balch Hall consists of four eighty-student halls, hence the more accurate name the Balch Halls, which has fallen out of use. Balch Hall is open only to female freshman and is divided into sections, known as units, each with a Residential Advisor who helps the new students acclimate themselves with the campus. This dorm is unique due to its old fashioned design as each room has a personal sink, or shares a sink with one other room. The dorm also houses the Carol Tatkon Center in which the residents can borrow movies, games, baking pans and other similar objects.http://newstudentprograms.cornell.edu/Tatkon/ History A stairway in the Balch courtyard In 1920, Cornell founded a committee to research the feasibility of constructing a new women's dormitory to meet the needs of the growing community. In 1922, Frederick L. Ackerman submitted a basic plot for the construction of a dormitory on North Campus and, with approval of the University's Architectural Advisory Board, began seeking donors with the promise that Cornell would pay for up to half of the building's construction. In 1928, the University accepted the $1,650,000 donation of Allen C. Balch '1889 and Janet Balch, a graduate student from 1886-88. When Balch opened in September 1929, it became the third female residential college at Cornell, after Sage College and Risley Hall. According to legend, Janet Balch insisted that her husband donate the money for the dormitory after attending an event at Allen's fraternity, Alpha Delta Phi. The story goes that Mrs. Balch was offended by the behavior of the undergraduate brothers at an Alpha Delta Phi function. She insisted that her husband did not donate further funds to the fraternity and instead build a dormitory dedicated to the welfare of female students.https://www.adphicornell.org/120-fame.asp To this day, as the Balches requested, the dormitory has remained an all-female dormitory. Facilities Balch Hall after snowfall On North Campus, Balch stands out for its majestic English Renaissance style. Originally, each of the four halls were decorated differently in \\"Early American, Georgian, English Jacobean, and modern Grammercy Park\\". At the end of Spring 2000 semester, the dining hall was closed and has been converted into a student center, cafe, and lecture hall known as the Carol Tatkon Center.http://ri.campuslife.cornell.edu/fs8.html The dorm rooms are unique in that each has its own working sink. In popular culture Balch Hall (or a model of it) was used in the film Love Potion No. 9 when Paul, the male lead character, uses the potion to take advantage of the all female dormitory.

It operates at 1600 kHz with a power output of 1,000 watts daytime and with a reduced power of 34 watts nighttime. It is a repeater of KJMJ 580 kHz in Alexandria, Louisiana, the originating English-language station of Radio Maria USA. History WULM's history dates back to 1946 when it was founded as commercial daytime station WJEL. At the time of its founding, the station was licensed in nearby Dayton, Ohio. Country music singer Donnie Bowser (Bowshier), a Springfield resident performed frequently on WJEL's live Saturday night program. In 1954, the station was moved to Springfield and was given new call letters: WBLY, which previously had been used by the present- day WIMA in Lima, Ohio. The BLY in WBLY stood for (Bill) Bailey, (Stan) Lucas and (Bob) Yontz. The Initials of the Three principal owners. The stations move was nearly coincidental with the move of Springfield station WWSO to Dayton, where it became WAVI (now known as the AM incarnation of WDAO formerly at 107.7 FM). WBLY's studios were first located in the Chamber of Commerce building at the corner of Spring and High streets in the early 1950s then moving to a more modern facility at 1711 West Main Street along with sister WBLY-FM which would later become WAZU (formerly WJEM, the FM sister to the original WJEL.) The station used the call letters WBLY from 1954 to 2002. It was owned and operated by Champion City Broadcasting which in the mid-1980s moved its studios to the restored (original) city building located downtown along with WAZU-FM prior to being sold off in the 1990s leaving WBLY without an FM. Bob Yontz sold the remaining AM station to son Ronald- hence Champion City Broadcasting became RAY (Ronald A. Yontz) Broadcasting operated by Jerry Staggs as part of a local marketing agreement with WIZE which he briefly owned and moving the WBLY studios to the WIZE site until 2002 when it was sold to Urban Light Ministries, a local non-denominational Christian charity in April 2002 which adopted the WULM call letters in August of that same year. Urban Light's purchase of the station kept it a locally owned and operated community citizen and was intended to help provide operating funds and a medium for the local ministry to reach out to pre-believers and to families in need. WULM remained the last locally owned/operated commercial radio station licensed by the FCC to Springfield still operating with studios and offices in Springfield until May 31, 2008. John Hall (John Stalder), a longtime Springfield radio broadcast legend, was the first station manager of WULM from 2002 to 2003. After Hall's death in 2004, the on-air studio originally used by WIZE was renovated in 2005 and dedicated in his memory by his longtime friend Bob Pitsch who was station manager from 2003 to 2006. Hall was best known as the longtime morning personality at WIZE and later a personality at WKSW, WLW, WGRR, WBNS and the former WCLR/WZLR \\"Oldies 95\\" in addition to doing voice- over work for the former WTJC-TV (now WBDT) and for numerous radio commercials and announcements in the Dayton-Springfield area. WBLY-FM Now WDHT (Hot 102.9), WBLY-FM was founded in 1958 and broadcast at 102.9 on the dial. It was a simulcast of WBLY from 1958‚Äì1979 and played the same middle of the road format as WBLY. It was also owned by Champion City Broadcasting. In 1979 they changed the call letters to WAZU (\\"FM-103 The Zoo...From A to Z to You\\") and stopped simulcasting WBLY and began playing adult contemporary music aimed at the Dayton audience. At that time it was licensed to Springfield and had the same studios as WBLY. In the late 1980s, one of the principal owners died. The heirs had the station appraised and found it to be worth millions of dollars. The station went on the market and was sold to Osborne Communications. From 1988‚Äì1995 the station competed fiercely with WTUE-FM but in 1995 it was sold to Great Trails Broadcasting and its call letters were changed to WING and it played classic rock from 1995‚Äì2001. It was known as WING-FM and had the same format until 2001 when it was sold to Radio One and changed to its current call sign WDHT and its urban format, \\"Blazin Hip Hop and R&B;\\". Mainline Broadcasting took over the station in 2007. The WING call letters are still in use (and were in use before WING-FM) by \\"ESPN Radio 1410\\".  Past programming  WULM has had many different formats over the years since it started broadcasting. Originally country (as WJEL) when it was founded, when it was sold to a group of local businessmen and the call letters were changed to WBLY for the principals - Bailey, Lucas and Yontz. The station operated at 1600 kHz with 1,000 watts of power from sunrise to sunset. During winter months, WBLY was authorized to operate at 250 watts from 6:00 AM until sunrise. The format was changed to talk in the morning along with music, with its host Smilin' Bob (Bob Yontz) and was a MOR station (Middle of the Road) the rest of the day. Smilin Bob remained a personality on the station through the 1970s and into the early 1990s. He became greatly known all around the valley. He was famous for giving all of his callers a nickname, and he handed out many. WBLY also aired a Sunday morning big band program hosted by Roger Sharp that was the top rated program in its time slot for the Dayton area. Upon Sharp's death in 1989, the Sunday morning program was hosted by Tom Eipper (airname Tom James). In 1981 WBLY changed its format to classic country and switching to oldies in 1987 and the following year it was \\"sold\\" to Yontz's son Ron, who operated RAY broadcasting. In 1988 WBLY moved its tower from its former AM-friendly location off West First Street to a more FM-friendly location on Miller Road. The tower move increased WAZU's coverage in the Dayton area, but was detrimental to the AM station. Also in 1988 WBLY (which was a \\"daytime\\" station) received authorization to operate 24 hours per day. The authorized power from sunset to sunrise was 30 watts. To celebrate, and in keeping with the format, staff members Dale Grimm and Jim Mosier were on the air for 24 continuous hours, operating from the station's \\"street studio\\" on the first floor of the Marketplace on South Fountain Avenue. WBLY switched the format to a news/sports/talk format in the early 1990s. WBLY did mostly Catholic Central games until WIZE went under and then began airing all teams in Clark County. It was famous for not only having 1 game but in football and basketball it aired one game live and one game on tape delay. It also did Wittenberg football and basketball games along with a show during the week. It also had a high school sports talk show during the week and a popular show on Saturday morning called \\"Sports Scene\\". During the tournament it would air all local teams' games, and sometimes there would be so many teams playing that they would go until 2:00 am. They also had great news coverage, and the news director was Darryl Bauer, who is now at WHIO. In 2002 WBLY was sold to Urban Light Ministries. After they changed the call letters to WULM they continued to have a news/sports/talk format but added more programming including a local morning talk show and a late-morning talk show that talked about the issues in Clark County. After that sports director Marty Bannister continued his \\"Sports Scene\\" show that he aired during the week and had done before when it was WBLY. They also added more network programming, including Bill O'Reilley. Unable to attract new listeners (and advertisers) with a talk format, WULM went to a unique \\"Rock n' Soul Classics\\" oldies format. It spotlighted the vintage hits from the first generation of the Top 40 and R&B; genres of the 1950s, 60s and early 70s. During this time, its weekend programs along with NASCAR coverage included The Motown Show, Dennis Mitchell's Breakfast With The Beatles, Oldies Coast To Coast, Little Walter's Time Machine, Glenn Sauter's Hits of Yesteryear and Cool Bobby B's Doo Wop Stop. That format ran from the summer of 2003 to the spring of 2006. On-air personalities included Marco Simmons (who also did high school sports play by play), Dale Grimm (also Sales Manager), Joe Madigan (then a student intern from John Carroll University and its campus FM station WJCU) and Bob Roberts (Bob Pitsch, General Manager). Michelle Phillips (Michelle Smart) worked with a news background as Darryl Bauer's replacement and later as Bob's on-air sidekick, Brad Lovett was sales associate and live remote broadcast personality and Jim Linthicum did freelance voice-over work for the oldies format. They then switched to \\"Springfield's Sunshine Station\\" with a format of \\"The Fun Hits of the 70s and More\\" featuring primarily Top 40 hits of the 70s and early 80s, anchored by \\"The Bubba and Bubbey Morning Show\\" (Rich Mellott and Brad Lovett.) On-air, traffic, sales and production staff included Linda Mellott, Natalia Mendez, and Bob Blindauer. During this time billings and long term contracts increased, and many on-air promotions and giveaways were done. In October 2006, the morning show and other staffers went on tours of haunted houses all over Southwest and Central Ohio, and gave away tickets to listeners. Winners were able to attend shows featuring the Blue Man Group, Trans Siberian Orchestra, Kenny Loggins, at Nationwide Arena and the Nutter Center, as well as performances of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", \\"Cats\\" and a Rat Pack tribute show at Victoria Theatre and the Schuster Center in Downtown Dayton. The fun continued as WULM's format was flipped to Christmas music of all genres in November and December 2006, with staffers and winners having the opportunity to visit the Christmas Story House in Cleveland and the Clifton Mill holiday lights. 1600 WULM (as \\"Springfield's Community Station\\" from 2007 to 2008) aired Christian-oriented News/Talk from the USA Radio Network. They carried nearly all of their entire talk programming schedule as well as their news and sports updates. WULM also produced local sports coverage in the last two decades before being sold to Radio Maria. The station produced a weekly sports program on Saturday mornings, and broadcast area high school sporting games. Marty Bannister, the current sideline football sideline reporter and women's basketball play-by-play for Ohio State, served as sports director of the station from the 90's until about 2005. Scott Leo, the current play-by-play man of the Columbus Clippers, broadcast games with Bannister and others at the station. WULM also had local programming. One such program was Urban Light Ministries president Rev. Eli Williams' mid-morning (10:00) talk program \\"Crossing Over\\" dealing with local people and issues from a Christian and local community perspective. Rev. Williams was also the host of \\"Urban Light Radio\\" a contemporary gospel music program which aired on WULM during Sunday morning programming as well on Saturdays on Cedarville University's WCDR and on its \\"CDR Radio\\" the chain was sold in 2011 to EMF Broadcasting. It is now WKCD. Rev. Williams now hosts The Hot Gospel 20, a locally produced online soul gospel music program. WULM also served the community with Speak Out a locally produced community forum/on air town meeting on Saturday mornings after The Saturday Morning Sports Show. From 2002 until July 2009, WULM's (and predecessor WBLY's) studios and offices were located on Miracle Mile in Springfield, at the transmitter site and former studios of WIZE which simulcast the programming of WONE in Dayton until the spring of 2011 when WIZE switched to a satellite country music format being fed from iHeart Media's Dayton studios. WULM's transmitter is located on Miller Road off State Route 41 West which is also the transmitting site of WDHT, originally the site of the former WBLY and WAZU, which was the former WBLY-FM, when both stations were owned by Champion City Broadcasting. Switchover to Radio Maria According to a Springfield News-Sun story dated March 10, 2008, the station was purchased by Radio Maria, an Italian-based Catholic radio network which owns and operates KJMJ, its originating USA English-language station in Alexandria, Louisiana. The sale and transfer of license of WULM was filed on February 15, 2008 and was later approved on April 16, 2008 by the FCC. The switchover to Radio Maria programming took place at 12 noon Eastern Standard Time on Saturday May 31, 2008. The WULM signal not only reaches the Dayton, Springfield and Miami Valley area, but reaches east towards Columbus, south towards Wilmington and Middletown, north towards Urbana and Bellefontaine and west towards Richmond, Indiana during daylight hours. An audiostream can also be accessed from its website (and from this article) for its listeners during evening hours (and outside its signal area) when WULM must power down just before local sunset to 34 watts in order to avoid interference with 25,000 watt KRVA a Spanish-language station in the Dallas/Fort Worth market and with urban progressive talker WWRL in New York City also with a 25,000 watt signal. WULM is simulcast for the Dayton area neighborhoods on FM translator W277AO 103.3 mHz in Enon since the fall of 2015. Previously, this translator rebroadcast WKCD (the former WCDR) airing K-LOVE programming until October 2015 when it switched to Radio Maria programming. Radio Maria programming on WULM is also available through its own World Family smartphone app in addition to a similar stream for Fire tablets and smartphones via the Tune In app and the Alexa device. Originating station KJMJ has been on the air as the US flagship station of Radio Maria since May 2000. Originally, the 580 frequency was home to KALB, sister station to KALB-TV channel 5. Radio Maria was founded at first with humble beginnings as a small parish operated station in the community of Erba (in the province of Como,) Italy in 1983 before its subsequent international growth in the 1990s which gave birth to the World Family in 1998. Emanuele Ferrario is Radio Maria's founder and was its first president. Its international home base is located in Rome with Carlo DiMaggio as its current president. Facilities and programming The Miller Road transmitter site shared with WDHT-FM is still in use. Though WULM along with WHJM licensed in Anna (serving the Upper Miami Valley and greater Lima area) for the most part is a repeater of KJMJ, there are several locally originating programs including \\"Living With Mary\\" which airs on Friday afternoons, Francesca Franchina's \\"From The Tummy To The Heart\\" and \\"Francesca and Friends\\" from The University of Dayton's Marian Library. The Miracle Mile studios were only used for broadcasting the originating network feed from Alexandria's KJMJ from May 2008 until February 2009. Due to satellite reception problems incurred early-on when its receiving dish was re-aligned, a new dish was installed at the Miller Rd. transmitting site in February 2009. In July 2009, Radio Maria and St. Vincent DePaul Society volunteers from the Dayton area moved the WULM studio facilities from the Miracle Mile location to a new studio which is located on the second floor of the Rev. John P. Boyle Memorial Center (the former parish convent also known as The Father Boyle Center) at 920 Lagonda Avenue next to St. Bernard Parish and the adjacent school east of downtown Springfield. The relocated WULM Springfield studio feeds several locally originating programs to originator KJMJ and its repeater network including \\"Be Your Best\\" presented by John Wright and \\"Meet The Author\\" presented by Ken Huck. In addition to the Springfield studio at the Father Boyle Center, a Dayton studio with administrative offices opened in the summer of 2011 in the Marianist Center at Mount Saint John at 2235 East Patterson Road near Beavercreek where additional live local programs air. One such program \\"Crossroads, A Journey To Conversion\\" is presented by Mark Newman in addition to \\"Marian Apparitions\\" presented by Mary Pyper, \\"Carmelite Conversations\\" with Mark Danis and \\"The Catholic Grab Bag\\" presented by Marianist Father John Fletcher who is the local resident priest director. In 2013, the Dayton studio moved to the Bergamo Center building at 4400 Shakertown Rd. on the south end of the Mount St. John campus when the former Marianist Center reverted to the Marianist Mission. The current mailing address for WULM remains as P.O. Box 3339 Dayton, Ohio 45401 where inquiries for station donations and needed local volunteers will be referred to. WULM listeners can also access the Radio Maria audiostream through the iPhone, BlackBerry, and Android mobile phone devices during the night time hours outside of Clark County and outside its regular daytime signal area. Downloads for the respective mobile device apps are found in the links below and at the Radio Maria USA website. Radio Maria USA also streams from its own World Family Smartphone app, the Tune In app and the Amazon Alexa device by utilizing the vocal command: \\"Alexa, Open Radio Maria.\\" ...thus Radio Maria's programming can also be heard throughout the Dayton/Springfield area on the aforementioned apps outside WULM's signal area. Aside from the WIZE transmitter still located at Miracle Mile, the studio facilities are now vacant. The WBLY calls are currently used by a low-power FM station in Sycamore, Georgia.

Since many Indian religions promote vegetarianism, Indian cuisine offers a wide variety of vegetarian delicacies Vegetarianism is strongly linked with a number of Dharmic traditions (religions) that originated in ancient India and Nepal (Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism), and it is sometimes linked with non-Dharmic religions. In Jainism, vegetarianism is mandatory for everyone; in Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism, it is promoted by scriptures and religious authorities but is not mandatory. In the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and certain Dharmic religion such as Sikhism, vegetarianism is less commonly viewed as a religious obligation, although in all these faiths there are groups actively promoting vegetarianism on religious grounds. Indian religions Most Indian religions have philosophical schools that forbid consumption of meat and Jainism institutes an outright ban on meat. Consequently, India is home to more vegetarians than any other country. About 30% of India's 1.2 billion population practices lacto vegetarianism, with overall meat consumption increasing. The per capita meat consumption in India in 2002 was 5.2 kg, while it was 24 times more in the United States at 124.8 kg. Meat consumption in the United States and India grew at about 40% over the last 50 years. In 1961, Indian per capita meat consumption was 3.7 kg, while the US consumption was 89.2 kg. =Jainism= ahimsa (non-violence), and this makes the Jains to prefer food that inflict the least amount of violence Vegetarianism in Jainism is based on the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa, literally \\"non-injuring\\"). Vegetarianism is considered mandatory for everyone. Jains are either lacto-vegetarians or vegans. No use or consumption of products obtained from dead animals is allowed. Moreover, Jains try to avoid unnecessary injury to plants and suksma jiva (Sanskrit for 'subtle life forms'; minuscule organisms). The goal is to cause as little violence to living things as possible, hence they avoid eating roots, tubers such as potatoes, garlic and anything that involves uprooting (and thus eventually killing) a plant to obtain food. Every act by which a person directly or indirectly supports killing or injury is seen as violence (hinsa), which creates harmful karma. The aim of ahimsa is to prevent the accumulation of such karma.Laidlaw, James: Riches and Renunciation. Religion, economy, and society among the Jains, Oxford 1995, p. 26‚Äì30, 191‚Äì195. Jains consider nonviolence to be the most essential religious duty for everyone (ahinsƒÅ paramo dharma·∏•, a statement often inscribed on Jain temples). Their scrupulous and thorough way of applying nonviolence to everyday activities, and especially to food, shapes their entire lives and is the most significant hallmark of Jain identity. A side effect of this strict discipline is the exercise of asceticism,Disclaimer: \\"The meaning of asceticism discourses is complex.\\" The word, however, is frequently used in a derogatory way against the veg(etari)an movement. Characterizing veganism as asceticism, pp. 141‚Äì142. In: which is strongly encouraged in Jainism for lay people as well as for monks and nuns. Jains do not practice animal sacrifice as they consider all sentient beings to be equal. =Hinduism= While vegetarianism is an integral part of Hinduism, there are a wide variety of practices and beliefs that have changed over time. Some sects of Hindus do not observe vegetarianism, while an estimated 33% of all Hindus are vegetarians. Nonviolence The principle of nonviolence (ahimsa) applied to animals is connected with the intention to avoid negative karmic influences which result from violence. The suffering of all beings is believed to arise from craving and desire, conditioned by the karmic effects of both animal and human action. The violence of slaughtering animals for food, and its source in craving, reveal flesh eating as one mode in which humans enslave themselves to suffering.Walters, Kerry S. and Portmess, Lisa. Religious Vegetarianism: From Hesiod to the Dalai Lama. State University of New York Press. New York, 2001. pp. 41, 42, 61, 62, 187, 191. . Hinduism holds that such influences affect the person who permits the slaughter of an animal, the person who kills it, the person who cuts it up, the person who buys or sells meat, the person who cooks it, the person who serves it up, and the person who eats it. They must all be considered the slayers of the animal. The question of religious duties towards the animals and of negative karma incurred from violence (himsa) against them is discussed in detail in Hindu scriptures and religious law books. Hindu scriptures belong or refer to the Vedic period which lasted till about 500 BCE according to the chronological division by modern historians. In the historical Vedic religion, the predecessor of Hinduism, meat eating was not banned in principle, but was restricted by specific rules. Several highly authoritative scriptures bar violence against domestic animals except in the case of ritual sacrifice. This view is clearly expressed in the Mahabharata (3.199.11‚Äì12;Mahabharata 3.199 is 3.207 according to another count. 13.115; 13.116.26; 13.148.17), the Bhagavata Purana (11.5.13‚Äì14), and the Chandogya Upanishad (8.15.1). For instance, many Hindus point to the Mahabharata's maxim that \\"Nonviolence is the highest duty and the highest teaching,\\"Mahabharata 13.116.37‚Äì41 as advocating a vegetarian diet. The Mahabharata also states that adharma (sin) was born when creatures started to devour one another from want of food and that adharma always destroys every creature \\"Mahabharata section LXVI\\" It is also reflected in the Manu Smriti (5.27‚Äì44), a traditional Hindu law book (Dharma≈õƒÅstra). These texts strongly condemn the slaughter of animals and meat eating. The Mahabharata (12.260;Mahabharata 12.260 . Mahabharata 12.260 s 12.268 according to another count. 13.115‚Äì116; 14.28) and the Manu Smriti (5.27‚Äì55) contain lengthy discussions about the legitimacy of ritual slaughter and subsequent consumption of the meat. In the Mahabharata both meat eaters and vegetarians present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Apart from the debates about domestic animals, there is also a long discourse by a hunter in defence of hunting and meat eating.Mahabharata 3.199 . Mahabharata 3.199 is 3.207 according to another count. These texts show that both ritual slaughter and hunting were challenged by advocates of universal non-violence and their acceptability was doubtful and a matter of dispute.Alsdorf pp. 572‚Äì577 (for the Manu Smriti) and pp. 585‚Äì597 (for the Mahabharata). Modern day In modern India, the food habits of Hindus vary according to their community or caste and according to regional traditions. Hindu vegetarians usually eschew eggs but consume milk and dairy products, so they are lacto-vegetarians. According to a survey of 2006, vegetarianism is weak in coastal states and strong in landlocked northern and western states and among Brahmins in general, 85% of whom are lacto- vegetarians. In 2018, a study from Economic and Political Weekly shows that in facts only a third of the upper-caste Indians could be vegetarian. Many coastal inhabitants are fish eaters. In particular, Bengali Hindus have romanticized fishermen and the consumption of fish through poetry, literature, and music. Hindus who eat meat are encouraged to eat Jhatka meat. Animal sacrifice in Hinduism Animal sacrifice in Hinduism (sometimes known as Jhatka Bali) is the ritual killing of an animal in Hinduism. The ritual sacrifice normally forms part of a festival to honour a Hindu god. For example, in Nepal the Hindu goddess Gadhimai, is honoured every five years with the slaughter of 250,000 animals. This practice was banned from 2015.. Bali sacrifice today is common at the Sakta shrines of the Goddess Kali. However, animal sacrifice is illegal in India. =Buddhism= Buddhist influenced Korean vegetarian side dishes. The First Precept prohibits Buddhists from killing people or animals. The matter of whether this forbids Buddhists from eating meat has long been a matter of debate, however, as vegetarianism is not a given in all schools of Buddhism. The first Buddhist monks and nuns were forbidden from growing, storing, or cooking their own food. They relied entirely on the generosity of alms to feed themselves, and were not allowed to accept money to buy their own food. They could not make special dietary requests, and had to accept whatever food alms givers had available, including meat. Monks and nuns of the Theravada school of Buddhism, which predominates in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, Burma, and Laos, still follow these strictures today. These strictures were relaxed in China, Korea, Japan, and other countries that follow Mahayana Buddhism, where monasteries were in remote mountain areas and the distance to the nearest towns made daily alms rounds impractical. There, Buddhist monks and nuns could cultivate their own crops, store their own harvests, cook their own meals, and accept money to buy foodstuffs in the market. According to the Vinaya Pitaka, when Devadatta urged him to make complete abstinence from meat compulsory, the Buddha refused, maintaining that \\"monks would have to accept whatever they found in their begging bowls, including meat, provided that they had not seen, had not heard, and had no reason to suspect that the animal had been killed so that the meat could be given to them\\". There were prohibitions on specific kinds of meat: meat from humans, meat from royal animals such as elephants or horses, meat from dogs, and meat from dangerous animals like snakes, lions, tigers, panthers, bears and hyenas. On the other hand, certain Mahayana sutras strongly denounce the eating of meat. According to the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the Buddha revoked this permission to eat meat and warned of a Dark Age when false monks would claim that they were allowed meat. In the Lankavatara Sutra, a disciple of the Buddha named Mahamati asks \\"[Y]ou teach a doctrine that is flavoured with compassion. It is the teaching of the perfect Buddhas. And yet we eat meat nonetheless; we have not put an end to it.\\" An entire chapter is devoted to the Buddha's response, wherein he lists a litany of spiritual, physical, mental, and emotional reasons why meat eating should be abjured. However, according to , this chapter on meat eating is a \\"later addition to the text....It is quite likely that meat-eating was practiced more or less among the earlier Buddhists, which was made a subject of severe criticism by their opponents. The Buddhists at the time of the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra did not like it, hence this addition in which an apologetic tone is noticeable.\\" points to a passage in the Surangama Sutra which implies advocacy of \\"not just a vegetarian, but a vegan lifestyle\\"; however, numerous scholars over the centuries have concluded that the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra is a forgery. Moreover, in the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the same sutra which records his retraction of permission to eat meat, the Buddha explicitly identifies as \\"beautiful foods\\" honey, milk, and cream, all of which are eschewed by vegans. However, in several other Mahayana scriptures, too (e.g., the Mahayana jatakas), the Buddha is seen clearly to indicate that meat-eating is undesirable and karmically unwholesome. Some suggest that the rise of monasteries in Mahayana tradition to be a contributing factor in the emphasis on vegetarianism. In the monastery, food was prepared specifically for monks. In this context, large quantities of meat would have been specifically prepared (killed) for monks. Henceforth, when monks from the Indian geographical sphere of influence migrated to China from the year 65 CE on, they met followers who provided them with money instead of food. From those days onwards Chinese monastics, and others who came to inhabit northern countries, cultivated their own vegetable plots and bought food in the market.[7][8] This remains the dominant practice in China, Vietnam, and part of Korean Mahayanan temples. Mahayana lay Buddhists often eat vegetarian diets on the vegetarian dates (ÈΩãÊúü). There are different arrangement of the dates, from several days to three months in each year, in some traditions, the celebration of the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara's birthday, enlightenment and leaving home days hold the highest importance to be vegetarian. In China, Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, and their respective diaspora communities, monks and nuns are expected to abstain from meat and, traditionally, eggs and dairy, in addition to the fetid vegetables ‚Äì traditionally garlic, Allium chinense, asafoetida, shallot, and Allium victorialis (victory onion or mountain leek), although in modern times this rule is often interpreted to include other vegetables of the onion genus, as well as coriander ‚Äì this is called pure vegetarianism or veganism (Á¥îÁ¥†, ch√∫ns√π). Pure vegetarianism or veganism is Indic in origin and is still practiced in India by some adherents of Dharmic religions such as Jainism and in the case of Hinduism, lacto-vegetarianism with the additional abstention of pungent or fetid vegetables. In the modern Buddhist world, attitudes toward vegetarianism vary by location. In China and Vietnam, monks typically eat no meat, with other restrictions as well. In Japan or Korea, some schools do not eat meat, while most do. Theravadins in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia do not practice vegetarianism. All Buddhists, including monks, are allowed to practice vegetarianism if they wish to do so. states that \\"There are no accurate statistics, but I would guess‚Äîand it is only a guess‚Äîthat worldwide about half of all Buddhists are vegetarian\\". =Sikhism= langar, all people eat a vegetarian meal as equals. Followers of Sikhism do not have a preference for meat or vegetarian consumption.\\"Misconceptions About Eating Meat ‚Äì Comments of Sikh Scholars,\\" at The Sikhism Home Page Sikhs and Sikhism, by I.J. Singh, Manohar, Delhi : Throughout Sikh history, there have been movements or subsects of Sikhism which have espoused vegetarianism. I think there is no basis for such dogma or practice in Sikhism. Certainly Sikhs do not think that a vegetarian's achievements in spirituality are easier or higher. It is surprising to see that vegetarianism is such an important facet of Hindu practice in light of the fact that animal sacrifice was a significant and much valued Hindu Vedic ritual for ages. Guru Nanak in his writings clearly rejected both sides of the arguments‚Äîon the virtues of vegetarianism or meat eating‚Äîas banal and so much nonsense, nor did he accept the idea that a cow was somehow more sacred than a horse or a chicken. He also refused to be drawn into a contention on the differences between flesh and greens, for instance. History tells us that to impart this message, Nanak cooked meat at an important Hindu festival in Kurukshetra. Having cooked it he certainly did not waste it, but probably served it to his followers and ate himself. History is quite clear that Guru Hargobind and Guru Gobind Singh were accomplished and avid hunters. The game was cooked and put to good use, to throw it away would have been an awful waste.Guru Granth Sahib, An Analytical Study by Surindar Singh Kohli, Singh Bros. Amritsar : The ideas of devotion and service in Vaishnavism have been accepted by Adi Granth, but the insistence of Vaishnavas on vegetarian diet has been rejected.A History of the Sikh People by Dr. Gopal Singh, World Sikh University Press, Delhi : However, it is strange that now-a-days in the Community-Kitchen attached to the Sikh temples, and called the Guru's Kitchen (or, Guru-ka-langar) meat-dishes are not served at all. May be, it is on account of its being, perhaps, expensive, or not easy to keep for long. Or, perhaps the Vaishnava tradition is too strong to be shaken off. There are two views on initiated or \\"Amritdhari Sikhs\\" and meat consumption. \\"Amritdhari\\" Sikhs (i.e., those who follow the Sikh Rehat Maryada, the Official Sikh Code of Conduct) can eat meat (provided it is not Kutha meat). \\"Amritdharis\\" who belong to some Sikh sects (e.g., Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Damdami Taksal, Namdhari,Vegetarianism and Meat-Eating in 8 Religions April/May/June 2007 Hinduism Today Rarionwalay,Philosophy of Sikhism by Gyani Sher Singh (PhD), Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. Amritsar: As a true Vaisnavite Kabir remained a strict vegetarian. Kabir far from defying Brahmanical tradition as to the eating of meat, would not permit so much, as the plucking of a flower (G.G.S. p. 479), whereas Nanak deemed all such scruples to be superstitions, Kabir held the doctrine of Ahinsa or the non-destruction of life, which extended even to that of flowers. The Sikh Gurus, on the contrary, allowed and even encouraged, the use of animal flesh as food. Nanak has exposed this Ahinsa superstition in Asa Ki War (G.G.S. p. 472) and Malar Ke War (G.G.S. p. 1288) etc.) are vehemently against the consumption of meat and eggs.\\"Langar,\\" at http://www.sikhwomen.com In the case of meat, the Sikh gurus have indicated their preference for a simple diet, which could include meat or not. Passages from the Guru Granth Sahib (the holy book of Sikhs, also known as the Adi Granth) say that fools argue over this issue. Guru Nanak said that overconsumption of food (Lobh, 'greed') involves a drain on the Earth's resources and thus on life. The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, prohibited the Sikhs from the consumption of halal or Kutha (any ritually slaughtered meat) meat because of the Sikh belief that sacrificing an animal in the name of God is mere ritualism (something to be avoided). On the views that eating vegetation would be eating flesh, first Sikh Guru Nanak states: On Vegetation, the Guru described it as living and experiencing pain: Page 143 of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Sikhs who eat meat eat Jhatka meat. Abrahamic religions Judaic, Christian, and Muslim traditions (Abrahamic religions) all have strong connections to the Biblical ideal of the Garden of Eden,Eric Baratay, l'anthropocentrisme du christianisme occidental, Si les lions pouvaient parler, essais sur la condition animale, sous la direction de Boris Cyrulnik, Gallimard, which includes references to a herbivore diet.[, ] While vegetarianism has not traditionally been viewed as mainstream in these traditions, some Jews, Christians, and Muslims practice and advocate vegetarianism. =Judaism= Though Jewish vegetarianism is not often viewed as mainstream, a number of Jews have argued for Jewish vegetarianism. Medieval rabbis such as Joseph Albo and Isaac Arama regarded vegetarianism as a moral ideal,Rabbi J. David Bleich, https://web.archive.org/web/20120518014142/http://www.innernet.org.il/article.php?aid=107, Reprinted with permission from \\"Contemporary Halakhic Problems, Volume III\\", KTAV Publishers. and a number of modern Jewish groups and Jewish religious and cultural authorities have promoted vegetarianism. Groups advocating for Jewish vegetarianism include Jewish Veg, a contemporary grassroots organization promoting veganism as \\"God's ideal diet\\", and the Shamayim V'Aretz Institute, which promotes a vegan diet in the Jewish community through animal welfare activism, kosher veganism, and Jewish spirituality. One source of advocacy for Jewish vegetarianism in Israel is Amirim, a vegetarian moshav (village). Jewish Veg has named 75 contemporary rabbis who encourage veganism for all Jews, including Jonathan Wittenberg, Daniel Sperber, David Wolpe, Nathan Lopes Cardozo, Kerry Olitzky, Shmuly Yanklowitz, Aryeh Cohen, Geoffrey Claussen, Rami M. Shapiro, David Rosen, Raysh Weiss, Elyse Goldstein, Shefa Gold, and Yonassan Gershom. Other rabbis who have promoted vegetarianism have included David Cohen, Shlomo Goren, Irving Greenberg, Asa Keisar, Jonathan Sacks, She'ar Yashuv Cohen, and Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog. Other notable advocates of Jewish vegetarianism include Franz Kafka, Roberta Kalechofsky, Richard H. Schwartz, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Aaron S. Gross. Jewish vegetarians often cite Jewish principles regarding animal welfare, environmental ethics, moral character, and health as reasons for adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet.Mary L. Zamore, ed. The Sacred Table: Creating a Jewish Food Ethic (New York, NY: CCAR Press, 2011). Some Jews point to legal principles including Bal tashkhit (the law which prohibits waste) and Tza'ar ba'alei hayyim (the injunction not to cause 'pain to living creatures').Kalechofsky, Roberta. Rabbis and Vegetarianism: An Evolving Tradition. Micah Publications. Massachusetts, 1995. pp. 16, 54, 55, 65, 66, 68, 70, 71. . Many Jewish vegetarians are particularly concerned about cruel practices in factory farms and high-speed, mechanized slaughterhouses.Mary L. Zamore, ed. The Sacred Table: Creating a Jewish Food Ethic (New York, NY: CCAR Press, 2011). Jonathan Safran Foer has raised these concerns in the short documentary film If This Is Kosher..., responding to what he considers abuses within the kosher meat industry. Some Jewish vegetarians have pointed out that Adam and Eve were not allowed to eat meat. states \\"And God said: Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree that has seed-yielding fruit‚Äîto you it shall be for food,\\" indicating that God's original plan was for mankind to be vegan.Schwartz, Richard H. Judaism and Vegetarianism. Lantern Books. New York, 2001. pp. 1, 12, 16, 19, 188. .¬∑ According to some opinions, the whole world will again be vegetarian in the Messianic era, and not eating meat brings the world closer to that ideal. As the ideal images of the Torah are vegetarian, one may see the laws of kashrut as actually designed to wean Jews away from meat eating and to move them toward the vegetarian ideal. =Christianity= Joseph Bates, vegetarian and one of the founders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Within Eastern Christianity, vegetarianism is practiced as part of fasting during the Great Lent (although shellfish and other non-vertebrate products are generally considered acceptable during some periods of this time); vegan fasting is particularly common in Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodox Churches, such as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which generally fasts 210 days out of the year. This tradition greatly influenced the cuisine of Ethiopia. Some Christian groups, such as Seventh-day Adventists, the Christian Vegetarian Association and Christian anarchists, take a literal interpretation of the Biblical prophecies of universal veg(etari)anism[, , ] and encourage veg(etari)anism as preferred lifestyles or as a tool to reject the commodity status of animals and the use of animal products for any purpose, although some of them say it is not required. Other groups point instead to allegedly explicit prophecies of temple sacrifices in the Messianic Kingdom, e.g. , where so-called peace offerings and so-called freewill offerings are said that will be offered, and where it states that such offerings are eaten, what may contradict the very purpose of Jesus' purportedly sufficient atonement. Several Christian monastic groups, including the Desert Fathers, Trappists, Benedictines, Cistercians and Carthusians, all of the Orthodox monks and also Christian esoteric groups, such as the Rosicrucian Fellowship, have encouraged pescatarianism.Article The Wisdom of the Vegetarian Diet by The Rosicrucian Fellowship (Esoteric Christians)Max Heindel (1910s), New Age Vegetarian Cookbook, The Rosicrucian Fellowship (publisher), 492 pages The Bible Christian Church, a Christian vegetarian sect founded by Reverend William Cowherd in 1809, were one of the philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society.; Gregory, James (2007) Of Victorians and Vegetarians. London: I. B. Tauris pp. 30‚Äì35. Cowherd encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of temperance. Some Christian vegetarians, such as Keith Akers, argue that Jesus himself was a vegetarian. Akers argues that Jesus was influenced by the Essenes, an ascetic Jewish sect. The present academic consensus is that Jesus was not an Essene.Young, Richard Alan. Is God a Vegetarian?. Carus Publishing Company. Chicago, 1999. pp. 4, 7, 56, 117. . There is no historical record of Jesus' precise attitudes to animals, but there is a strand in his ethical teaching about the primacy of mercy to the weak, the powerless and the oppressed, which Walters and Portmess argue can also refer to captive animals. Other, more recent Christians movements, such as Sarx and CreatureKind, do not maintain that Jesus himself was a vegetarian, but instead argue that many practices which occur in the contemporary industrialized farming system, such as the mass culling of day- old male-chicks in the egg industry, are incompatible with the life of peace and love to which Jesus called his followers. =Islam= Islam explicitly prohibits eating of some kinds of meat, especially pork. However, one of the most important Islamic celebrations, Eid al-Adha, involves animal sacrifices. Muslims who can afford to do so sacrifice domestic animals (usually sheep, but also camels, cows, and goats). According to the Quran, a large portion of the meat has to be given towards the poor and hungry, and every effort is to be made to see that no impoverished Muslim is left without sacrificial food during the days of feasts like Eid-ul-Adha. Certain Islamic orders are mainly vegetarian; many Sufis maintain a vegetarian diet. Some Muslims think that being a vegetarian for reasons other than health is un-Islamic and it is a form of emulation of the infidels (tashabbuh bil kuffar). Vegetarianism has been practiced by some influential Muslims including the Iraqi theologian, female mystic and poet Rabia of Basra, who died in the year 801, the Sufi mystic and poet Rumi and the Sri Lankan Sufi master Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, who established The Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship of North America in Philadelphia. The former Indian president Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was also famously a vegetarian. In January 1996, The International Vegetarian Union announced the formation of the Muslim Vegetarian/Vegan Society. Proponents of vegetarianism in Islam have pointed to the teachings in the Quran and the Hadith which instruct kindness and compassion towards animals: > \\"Transgress not in the balance, and weigh with justice, and skimp not in the > balance...earth, He set it down for all beings\\" > - Surrah Ar-Rahman 55:8‚Äì10 \\"Whoever is kind to the creatures of God is > kind to himself.\\" > - Hadith: Bukhari \\"A good deed done to an animal is as meritorious as a > good deed done to a human being, while an act of cruelty to an animal is as > bad as an act of cruelty to a human being.\\" > - Hadith: Mishkat al-Masabih; Book 6; Chapter 7, 8:178 =Rastafari= Rastafari generally follow a diet called \\"I-tal\\", which eschews the eating of food that has been artificially preserved, flavoured, or chemically altered in any way. Some Rastafari consider it to also forbid the eating of meat but the majority will not eat pork at the very least, considering it unclean. =Bah√° º√≠ Faith= While there are no dietary restrictions in the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, 'Abdu'l-Bah√°, the son of the founder of the religion, noted that a vegetarian diet consisting of fruits and grains was desirable, except for people with a weak constitution or those that are sick. He stated that there are no requirements that Bah√° º√≠s become vegetarian, but that a future society would gradually become vegetarian. 'Abdu'l-Bah√° also stated that killing animals was somewhat contrary to compassion. While Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated that a purely vegetarian diet would be preferable since it avoided killing animals, both he and the Universal House of Justice (the governing body of the Bah√°'√≠s) have stated that these teachings do not constitute a Bah√° º√≠ practice and that Bah√° º√≠s can choose to eat whatever they wish, but to be respectful of others' beliefs. Other religions =Manichaeism= Manichaeism was a religion established by the Iranian named Mani during the Sassanian Empire. The religion prohibited slaughtering or eating animals. =Zoroastrianism= Mazdakism, a sect of Zoroastrianism, explicitly promoted vegetarianism. The sect was founded by Mazdak. One of the main precepts in Zoroastrianism is respect and kindness towards all living things and condemnation of cruelty against animals The Shahnameh states that the evil king of Iran, Zohak was first taught eating meat by the evil one who came to him in the guise of a cook. This was the start of an age of great evil for Iran. Prior to this, in the Golden age of mankind in the days of the great Aryan Kings, man did not eat meat. The Pahlavi scriptures state that in the final stages of the world, when the final Saviour Saoshyant arrives, man will become more spiritual and gradually give up meat eating. Vegetarianism is stated to be the future state of the world in Pahlavi scriptures ‚Äì Atrupat-e Emetan in Iran in Denkard Book VI requested all Zoroastrians to be vegetarians: \\"ku.san enez a-on ku urwar xwarishn bawed shmah mardoman ku derziwishn bawed, ud az tan i gospand pahrezed, ce amar was, eg Ohrmaz i xwaday hay.yarih i gospand ray urwar was dad.\\" Meaning: They hold this also: Be plant eaters (urwar xwarishn) (i.e. vegetarian), O you, men, so that you may live long. Keep away from the body of cattle (tan i gospand), and deeply reckon that Ohrmazd, the Lord has created plants in great number for helping cattle (and men).\\" =Nation of Islam= The Nation of Islam promotes vegetarianism deeming it the \\"most healthful and virtuous way to eat\\". =Taoism= In Chinese societies, \\"simple eating\\" (Á¥†È£ü Mandarin: s√π sh√≠) refers to a particular restricted diet associated with Taoist monks, and sometimes practiced by members of the general population during Taoist festivals and fasting days. It is similar to Chinese Buddhist vegetarianism. Varying levels of abstinence among Taoists and Taoist-influenced people include veganism, veganism without root vegetables, lacto-ovo vegetarianism, and pescetarianism. Taoist vegetarians also tend to abstain from alcohol and pungent vegetables such as garlic and onions during lenten days. Non- vegetarian Taoists sometimes abstain from beef and water buffalo meat for many cultural reasons. Vegetarianism in the Taoist tradition is similar to that of Lent in the Christian tradition. While highly religious people such as monks may be vegetarian, vegan or pescetarian on a permanent basis, lay practitioners often eat vegetarian on the 1st (new moon), 8th, 14th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 28th, 29th and 30th days of the lunar calendar. In accordance with their Buddhist peers, and because many people are both Taoist and Buddhist, they often also eat lenten on the 15th day (full moon). Taoist vegetarianism is similar to Chinese Buddhist vegetarianism, however, its roots reach to pre- Buddhist times. Believers historically abstained from animal products and alcohol before practicing Confucian, Taoist and Chinese folk religion rites. It is referred to by the English word \\"vegetarian\\"; however, though it rejects meat, eggs, and milk, this diet may include oysters and oyster products or otherwise be pescetarian for some believers. Many lay Taoists who follow modern sects such as that of Yi Guan Dao or Master Ching Hai are vegan or strictly vegetarian. = Faithist/Oahspe = Oahspe(Meaning Sky, Earth and Spirit) is the doctrinal book of those who follow Faithism. The precepts for behavior can be found throughout the book which include\\" a herbivorous diet (vegan, vegetable food only), peaceful living (no warring or violence; pacifism), living a life of virtue, service to others, angelic assistance, spiritual communion, and communal living when it is feasible to do so. Freedom and responsibility are two themes reiterated throughout the text of Oahspe. =Neopaganism= There is no set teaching on vegetarianism within the diverse neopagan communities, however many do follow a vegetarian diet often connected to ecological concerns as well as the welfare and rights of animals. Vegetarian practitioners of Wicca will often see their standpoint as a natural extension of the Wiccan Rede. Organizations like SERV refer to the historic figures of Porphyry, Pythagoras and Iamblichus as sources for the Pagan view of vegetarianism. During the 1970s the publication Earth Religion News, focused on articles related to neopaganism and vegetarianism, it was edited by the author Herman Slater. =Meher Baba's teachings= The spiritual teacher Meher Baba recommended a vegetarian diet for his followers\\"False Beliefs, Book Two: Meat Eating.\\" Retrieved 5 July 2011. because he held that it helps one to avoid certain impurities: \\"Killing an animal for sport, pleasure or food means catching all its bad impressions, since the motive is selfish....Impressions are contagious. Eating meat is prohibited in many spiritual disciplines because therein the person catches the impressions of the animal, thus rendering himself more susceptible to lust and anger.\\"Baba, Meher (1988). Sparks of the Truth: From the Dissertations of Meher Baba . Myrtle Beach: Sheriar Press. pp. 24‚Äì25. . =Creativity movement= The Creativity religion promotes a form of fruitinarian raw food diet in its \\"Salubrious Living\\" health program named after the third text of the faith written by Arnold DeVries and Ben Klassen, which encourages the consumption of only raw foods in their \\"natural state, basically fruits, vegetables, grains and nuts,\\" getting plenty of physical exercise as well as abstinence from alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, sugar, preservatives, insecticides, narcotics and other drugs whether prescription or non-prescription.Little White Book ‚Äì 07 Three Short Rules for Maintaining Excellent Health Salubrious Living is considered mandatory to \\"fully practice\\" Creativity and a lawsuit is currently in place against the Bureau of Prisons to get it recognized as a religious dietary preference for incarcerated adherents of the religious movement.

He is married to jazz singer Flora Purim, and their daughter Diana Moreira is also a singer. Coming to prominence in the late 1960s as a member of the Brazilian ensemble Quarteto Novo, he moved to the United States and worked in jazz fusion with Miles Davis and Return to Forever. Biography Airto Moreira was born in Itai√≥polis, Brazil, into a family of folk healers, and raised in Curitiba and S√£o Paulo. Showing an extraordinary talent for music at a young age, he became a professional musician at age 13, noticed first as a member of the samba jazz pioneers Sambalan√ßo Trio and for his landmark recording with Hermeto Pascoal in Quarteto Novo in 1967. Shortly after, he followed his wife Flora Purim to the United States. After moving to the US, Moreira began playing regularly with jazz musicians in New York, including the bassist Walter Booker. Through Booker, Moreira began playing with Joe Zawinul, who in turn introduced him to Miles Davis. At this time Davis was experimenting with electronic instruments and rock and funk rhythms, a form which would soon come to be called jazz fusion. Moreira was to participate in several of the most important projects of this emerging musical form. He stayed with Davis for about two years, touring and participating in the creation of the seminal fusion recording Bitches Brew (1970). Shortly after leaving Davis, Moreira joined other Davis alumni Zawinul, Wayne Shorter and Miroslav Vitous in their group Weather Report, playing percussion on their first album (1971). He left Weather Report (replaced by Dom Um Rom√£o and Muruga Booker for their Sweetnighter album) to join fellow Davis alumnus Chick Corea's new band Return to Forever. He played drums on Return to Forever's first two albums: Return to Forever and Light as a Feather in 1972. Moreira was a contributor to many of Grateful Dead percussionist Mickey Hart's world music/percussion albums in Rykodisc's The World collection, including The Apocalypse Now Sessions, Dafos, Supralingua, and Planet Drum, which won a World Music Grammy in 1991. He can be heard playing congas on Eumir Deodato's 1970s space-funk hit \\"Also sprach Zarathustra\\" on the album Prelude. Moreira has played with many of the greatest names in jazz including Cannonball Adderley, Lee Morgan, Paul Desmond, Dave Holland, Jack DeJohnette, John McLaughlin, Keith Jarrett, Al Di Meola, Zakir Hussain, George Duke and Mickey Hart. In addition to jazz concerts and recordings, he has composed and contributed music to film and television (including scores for Apocalypse Now and Last Tango in Paris), played at the re-opening of the Library of Alexandria, Egypt (along with fellow professor of ethnomusicology Halim El- DabhSeachrist, Denise A. (2003). The Musical World of Halim El-Dabh. Kent, Ohio, United States: Kent State University Press 296 pp ), and taught at UCLA and the California Brazil Camp. In 1996, Moreira and his wife Flora Purim collaborated with P.M. Dawn on the song \\"Non-Fiction Burning\\" for the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Rio, produced by the Red Hot Organization. Instruments Moreira has played pandeiro, cuica, congas, bongos, shekere, talking drum, tambourine, maracas, shaker, triangle, cowbell, caxixi, drums, Afox√©, tubular bells, snare drum, berimbau, temple blocks, ganza, surdo, bell tree, wood blocks, jam block, mark tree, cymbals, cabasa, bass drum, timbales, gong, tamborim, drum machine, vibraphone, djembe, floor tom, whistles, conch shell, tom-tom, bells, tabla, hi-hat, sleigh bells, agogo bells, guiro, marimba, castanets and beat box. Awards * Moreira was voted the number one percussionist in \\"Down Beat Magazine's Critics Poll\\" for the years 1975 through 1982 and most recently in 1993. * In September 2002, Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso added Moreira and Purim to the \\"Order of Rio Branco\\", one of Brazil's highest honors.

She is a robot built by Senbei Norimaki who looks like a young girl. She is known for her na√Øvet√©, energetic personality, lack of common sense, and amazing strength. Senbei tries to convince the other citizens of Penguin Village that she is just a normal human girl, and it seems to work, despite her superhuman athletic ability. Among her strengths, she can use abilities that range from the terrain splitting to the beam-like . However, she is nearsighted and needs to wear glasses. Creation and conception Toriyama claimed that when he told his editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, that he wanted to make a manga about a doctor, Torishima told him to add a robot. Toriyama originally wanted a very large robot, but as it would not fit in the panels, he instead made it small. When his editor rejected that idea, he made the robot a girl knowing Torishima would find her \\"cute.\\" He also stated that Senbei was supposed to be the main character, but his editor told him to make it Arale instead, which Toriyama agrees turned out better. Torishima later elaborated on this, saying that Arale was initially only a guest character for one chapter. However, because he really liked Toriyama's girl characters the editor wanted her to be the main character. The artist felt differently because Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump is aimed at boys. The two made a bet; Toriyama created a special issue with a female lead, and whoever's story took higher in the magazine's reader poll would win. Torishima won, but because he is stubborn, Toriyama refused to change the Dr. Slump name. Toriyama purposefully gives his protagonists plain appearances as he prefers to focus on the story. He believes that having weak-looking characters turn out to actually be strong is more interesting; Arale and Son Goku are prime examples of this. Like the names of many other characters, Arale is a pun on the name for a bite-sized rice cracker (arare), and with the family name (\\"Norimaki Arale\\") it refers to a sort of arare wrapped with nori seaweed. Initially, her glasses were just a gag, with Toriyama wanting to remove them as they made her more difficult to draw. However, they became a trademark of Arale's and readers who had to wear glasses wrote him saying that by Arale having them it made them feel better about themselves, so he ended up keeping them. Arale is usually shown with purple hair, although it is dark brown in the 1997 anime. Appearances =In Dr. Slump= Arale Norimaki's appearance in the 1997 Doctor Slump anime. Arale poses as Senbei's sister or daughter, depending on who Senbei is talking to. The Norimaki family only grows from there when Arale and Senbei discover an egg when traveling to the past. The egg hatches into a small winged creature that they nickname Gatchan. Then Senbei marries the girl of his dreams (Midori Yamabuki) and they have a son named Turbo. As if the house was not full enough, Gatchan inexplicably splits into two separate entities. The Dr. Slump series is a self-proclaimed gag manga with no ongoing plot. The entire series is about Arale's humorous exploration of the dynamics of life and the adventures Senbei and his inventions send them on. Arale has unique phrases she often uses, such as , , to express bewilderment, and yelling when she runs with her hands out. =In other media= Arale appears in Toriyama's Dragon Ball when Son Goku chases General Blue all the way to Penguin Village, she then defeats Blue with one kick and one headbutt after he paralyzes Goku. She is also able to ride on the Kinto'un, which indicates her as being pure of heart. In the anime adaptations, Arale is first seen in a picture on the wall of the capsule house Bulma creates in Dragon Ball episode 2, again on the television that Kame- Sennin is watching in episode 16, and on a poster in Son Gohan's bedroom in Dragon Ball Z. She also appears in The Great Mystical Adventure film, and her face was shown in the eighth Dragon Ball Z movie. Arale has appeared twice in Dragon Ball Super, first making a brief cameo appearance in episode 43 and later playing a key role in episode 69. Arale is also a playable character in the crossover video games Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars, both for the Nintendo DS, and J-Stars Victory Vs for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita. She is also playable in several Dragon Ball video games, including Dragon Ball Z: Sparking! Meteor, Dragon Ball: World's Greatest Adventure and Dragon Ball DS 2: Charge! Red Ribbon Army. In 2014, two commercials featuring Dr. Slump were created by Toei Animation for Suzuki. The commercials advertise the car manufacturer's Kei SUV Hustler and include new acting from Mami Koyama as Arale and Kumiko Nishihara as Gatchan. In 2016, Ayami Nakajo portrayed Arale in a commercial for G.u. clothing. It shows Akane Kimidori (Yuki Uchida) and Peasuke Soramame (Kengo Kora) bewildered when Arale trades in her trademark overalls for a pleated skirt. Voice actors Arale is voiced by Mami Koyama in the first Dr. Slump anime, Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Super. She is voiced by Taeko Kawata in the second Dr. Slump anime and by Yuko Hara, keyboardist of the popular rock band Southern All Stars, in the radio drama. Reception In 1982, Arale came in 12th place in Animages fourth annual Anime Grand Prix for Favorite Character. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network wrote that among Dr. Slumps cast, Arale is the standout; \\"The way she laughs and runs and raises unwitting hell are all unforgettable.\\" Her role in Dragon Ball Super was praised by Sam Leach from ANN due to how she clashes with the protagonists Goku and Vegeta; the latter often breaking the fourth wall stating they cannot defeat a person from a gag series. When asked in 1987 who would win if Arale and Son Goku were to fight, Toriyama said Arale was stronger. Masashi Kishimoto, creator of Naruto, gained an interest in drawing during his childhood from drawing pictures of Arale. =In popular culture= In the 1985 Hong Kong film My Lucky Stars, Jackie Chan's character appears in an Arale costume while working undercover in a theme park. Japanese comedian H≈çsei Yamasaki dressed up as Arale, doing her signature \\"Kiiin\\" and \\"N'cha\\" on the Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!! Cosplay Bus Tour series. Because of failing to complete his task (getting spaghetti for the entire cast) he then had to fly to Italy to get spaghetti for the entire cast and crew, dressed as Arale all the way. An episode of the American TV show America's Funniest Home Videos featured a video with a cutout of Arale that people could stick their head through, only to have it fall down. The 2004 Samurai Champloo episode \\"Bogus Booty\\" has a scene where Mugen impersonates Arale's signature run by sticking his arms out and making the sound \\"Kiiin\\". The main character of the 2018 video game Dragon Quest Builders 2, for which Toriyama was the character designer, runs with their hands out like Arale. Korean mixed martial artist Seo Hee Ham is nicknamed \\"Arale-chan\\" in Japan due to her appearance outside of the ring bearing resemblance to the fictional character.

A significant contributor to the success of the Grupo Aco was the innovative introduction in Venezuela of in-house auto sale financing using a captive finance company. Whereas Grupo Aco had equity stakes in a great number of companies, the balance of ownership of many of these companies was held by Grupo Aco shareholders. As a result, Grupo Aco commanded a larger market share than would be suggested only by its totally owned companies. It attained US $900 million in sales during 1973 and ranked as the most profitable private sector company in the nation that year. Changes in Venezuela's economy and political environment during the early 1980s caused a downturn for many large businesses in Venezuela. In the case of the Aco Group, a financial crisis emerged as motor vehicle sales plummeted. By 1993, the Aco Group was forced into reorganization and a restructuring of the entire group. This led to Harry Mannil becoming the largest shareholder, at 24% of common shares. Efforts to recover financially were overwhelmed by continuous declines in the nation's private sector economy. Aco, S.A. was splintered into several groups, with a substantial number of auto dealerships taken under direct ownership by Harry Mannil.

One of the first representatives of this movement was Luis Galich with his band Santa F√© who played gigs and concerts in Guatemala City and some surrounding towns. Bands like Pl√°stico Pesado (Manu Ramirez, Tacuche, Rollin y Paco Lam), later renamed Quetzalum√°n, played more experimental and original music. Other psychedelic bands of the time included: S.O.S. (Rony de Leon, Chepito Hope, David de Gandarias, Armando Fong ), Caballo Loco, Apple Pie (Tito Henkle, Luis Zetina, Rico Molina & Gentry), Cuerpo y Alma, Banda Cl√°sica, Cerebro, La Compa√±√≠a, Siglo XX, Eclipse, and Pastel de Fresa.PLASTICO PESADO in its original format (1975) One remarkable milestone was the unprecedented creation in 1973‚Äì74 of the rock opera Coraz√≥n del sol naciente (Heart of the Sunrise) by Sol Naciente' a large youth group formed by dancers, solo vocalists, an extended chorus, as well as a band which included Guatemalan percussion instruments as well as unplugged acoustic guitars, piano, and solo violin. Some of the band members later formed the group Alci√≥n. A very important and popular band during the late 1990s and early 2000s was Alux Nahual. They are one of the Spanish lyric writing/singing rock bands that have released a number of recordings in Guatemala. In the beginning, they were heavily influenced by progressive rock' bands such as Kansas and Jethro Tull (band). Though they added a very important native theme to their lyrics, it never really evolved into their sound. Their members are active musicians playing reunion concerts but mostly keep working as individuals producing and performing. Another popular band was Extincion, which opened for bands such as Control Machete and Enrique Bunbury. They were characterized by their hard lyrics and speed metal sounds. Guatemalan rock bands such as Radio Viejo, Ricardo Andrade y los √öltimos Adictos (which disbanded after their leader, Ricardo Andrade, was murdered in Sanarate, El Progreso), Bohemia Suburbana, Viernes verde and Viento en Contra enjoyed popularity among high-school and college students during the 1990s and 2000s. Also popular were Fabulas and La Tona, and Bohemia Suburbana, the most influential band to emerge from the scene around that decade. Fusing influences like U2 and Soda Stereo, Bohemia Suburbana created something rooted in well-crafted melodies and arrangements. Their most noted influences came from underground American and European sounds and some from South America and the Caribbean. The band has been active again after their reunion in 2012 called BS20; they released a new album entitled Imaginaria Sonora which put them back in the Guatemalan rock scene.http://www.prensalibre.com/vida/escenario/bohemia-suburbana-lanza-el- album-imaginaria-sonora Their recent single/video Pero Nadie received 20,000 views in one day.http://www.soy502.com/articulo/bohemia-suburbana-lanza-video- sencillo-pero-nadie-32539 Viernes verde en Miami, abril 2012, grabando su 6to album Additionally, Viernes verde, which originated almost at the same time as Bohemia Suburbana, has remained active even with lineup changes since 1993 when they became active. They are also the founders of the rock festival La Garra Chapina which was created by them to help newcomers get into the Guatemalan rock industry. According to their official band web page, the idea of this concert was to transmit their message through audiovisual aids to represent historical Guatemalan moments. This concert event was one of the first to be broadcast in its entirety by national radio stations in Guatemala. It had a full house and has been continued annually since 1999. Viernes Verde started as a grunge band, but has evolved to play different music styles which gives the band one of its distinctive characteristics. The sounds of Viernes Verde, based on the majority of their songs, would be described as alternative rock. One of the main factors that allowed the group to gain such a strong popularity is their ability to appeal to a broad audience. On their first album titled, Cenizas Bajo Tus Pies, they have six tracks in Spanish and four in English. Having songs in both languages allows them the opportunity to connect with a larger audience. Some Guatemalan rock bands active in the present are: Razones de Cambio, El Tambor de la Tribu, Malacates Trebol Shop, Viernes verde, Redhka, La Gran Calabaza, El Clubo, Viento en Contra, Anarkia, Sinattra, Legi√≥n, Vitriolo, Bohemia Suburbana, and Especies, among many others. Newer bands, like 4 Tiempos, have emerged in the early 2000s. Hedras Ramos is a young rock guitar player, perhaps the most prolific guitarist representing Guatemala in countries like England and Romania at rock world guitar competitions like Guitar Idol and Ziua Chitarelor 3 respectively. Guatemalan Rock and Roll came to be an influence in the broader Guatemalan society and was synonymous with rebellion, yet it never provided a medium in which a broad base of youth from the 60s and 70s could make something influential enough to affect change in all sectors of society. There were some major factors that prohibited it from being popularly accepted among the country of Guatemalans. During this period, there was a lot of corruption and social unrest in Guatemala. The police would often search and arrest audience members at rock gigs, as well as many other types of gatherings. On occasion, musicians would go missing and never be found or would be found dead. Another factor was that rock music was mainly produced in English. It took some time for the transition of rock music from English to Spanish to be accepted as rock by the people. Today, the sound of the bands has so much to do with what North America produces, and the only efforts to make something original have been attempts to fuse native elements with a rock sound. A unique case on the scene is the rock band Sobrevivencia from Huehuetenango, whose lyrics are sung in Mam, a Mayan language spoken in the Guatemalan northwest. In 2011, a new movement was born called El Ritmo de La Paz created by the company Impulsos Creativos. Its main approach was for new or amateur rock bands to compete for the prize of recording their first album with the company and promotion in the media. 13 amateur bands joined the movement and only seven made it to the finals; they played along with professional bands at Parque de la Industria such as Silent Poetry, Conciencia Sublime, Arena Rock, Nova Epica, Bhios (Huehuetenango), Artifice and Metal Requiem. The winner of the contest was a band called Iridium Mas Alla de Mi Tierra who have been promoted by Impulsos Creativos. They have appeared on national television, and they have been interviewed and their songs played on national radio stations. They are recording their first album as they play numerous concerts. El Ritmo de La Paz is an annual Rock Festival with a message for the utopian peace that every Guatemalan desires.

Three of his grandparents had been enslaved. His paternal grandfather was hanged for killing his master. Johns's maternal grandfather was a Mr. Price, a white man. Price had a long-standing relationship with Johns's maternal grandmother. After killing another white man who tried to rape her, Price was convicted and served prison time. When she died young, their daughter Sallie Price (who later became Johns's mother) was raised by Price's white wife.

He refused to sit there and demanded, and got, his money back. He sometimes ruffled feathers among his upper- and middle-class congregation by selling his farm produce outside the church building. Johns's niece, Barbara Johns, led a student strike in Prince Edward County, Virginia in 1951. Ultimately she was involved in a suit against the county, Davis vs. Prince Edward County. This was one of five cases that was combined in the Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka suit that reached the U.S. Supreme Court. It ruled that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional and urged states to desegregate such facilities. Ms. Johns noted that one of her inspirations was her uncle, Rev.

Standard hydrogen bonds are asymmetrical, with the hydrogen being associated with one heteroatom. When the pKa between the heteroatoms is equal, a symmetrical hydrogen bond forms with the hydrogen properly between two locations. At shorter distances, the barrier between the two energy minima is low enough that the hydrogen is equally bound as a low-barrier, or single-well hydrogen bond. A symmetric hydrogen bond is a special type of hydrogen bond in which the proton is spaced exactly halfway between two identical atoms. The strength of the bond to each of those atoms is equal. It is an example of a 3-center 4-electron bond. This type of bond is much stronger than \\"normal\\" hydrogen bonds, in fact, its strength is comparable to a covalent bond. It is seen in ice at high pressure (Ice X), and also in the solid phase of many anhydrous acids such as hydrofluoric acid and formic acid at high pressure. It is also seen in the bifluoride ion [F‚àíH‚àíF]‚àí. Much has been done to explain the symmetric hydrogen bond quantum-mechanically, as it seems to violate the duet rule for the first shell: The proton is effectively surrounded by four electrons.

According to official sources, this song was performed by Sim Soo-bong during the party the night of Park's assassination. In the movie, however, Sim Soo-bong is summoned to perform Japanese enka songs. is a 2005 satirical black comedy film by South Korean director Im Sang-soo about the events leading to and the aftermath of the assassination of Park Chung-hee, then the South Korean President, by his close friend and Korean Intelligence Agency director Kim Jae-kyu. The film's portrayal of Park was a subject of controversy, leading to a lawsuit against the film's makers by Park Chung- hee's only son, Park Ji-man. In 2005, a ruling by the Seoul Central Court ordered that 3 minutes and 50 seconds of documentary footage (mostly of demonstrations) be censored out of the film. In response, the director had the excised footage replaced with a blank screen for its running time. During its theatrical run, both nationally and internationally, only the censored version was shown. The ruling was appealed, and in August 2006 overturned, with the court issuing the following statement: \\"We must broadly confirm the right of free expression concerning the depiction of public historical figures.\\" The court also concluded that several scenes were an unjust smear against the former president and ordered MK Pictures, the production company that financed the film, to pay President Park's family 100 million won (roughly $105,000 USD). http://www.cine21.com/news/view/mag_id/27750 Almost the entirety of the film focuses on the few hours before and after Park's assassination on October 26, 1979. Undoubtedly the most controversial aspect of the film is its portrayal of Park: in the film, he is shown to be a cowardly libertine who is seen having late-night drinking parties, pawing young women, and in particular having much admiration for Japanese culture to the point of occasionally speaking Japanese himself. The memory of Japanese occupation remains fresh in the minds of many South Koreans; this was seen to imply Park had affection for - if not association with - Korea's former colonial rulers. It screened in the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. Plot At a luxurious brothel in South Korea, KCIA Chief Agent Ju deals with the mother of a young woman who was one of South Korean president Park Chung-hee's playmates, who has come with her daughter to offer her again to the President, by interrogating and intimidating them. KCIA director Kim gets scolded by a doctor about his drinking, a direct result of having to attend President Park's drinking parties. Scenes of various officials and low officers making their way to a heavily guarded safehouse follow, including Chief Agent Ju procuring an attractive young woman and the famous enka and trot singer Sim Soo-bong for the party. During the dinner, President Park, his personal bodyguard, Cha Ji-cheol, Director Kim, Chief Secretary Yang (appointed to the post to be Park's drinking buddy, and portrayed as a total sycophant) discuss how to deal with demonstrators, with Cha berating Kim for not being repressive enough. Kim, having been agitated the entire day, decides then to kill Park, and hatches the plan with Chief Agent Ju and KCIA Colonel Min. Director Kim returns to the party, shoots Cha (who is unarmed) and Park, each with a single shot before jamming the pistol. Soon thereafter, Agent Ju and Col. Min and a few minions kill the president's personal bodyguards and secure the building. Kim comes back with another gun, finishes off Cha, and gives Park his personal opinion before executing him with a shot to the head. They move to make the scene resemble an ambush by North Korean forces, and Kim uses the political fear and tension to his advantage while convening a Cabinet Council. Later, Director Kim and Colonel Min meet with the Army higher-ups to sell them their version of events, but Chief Secretary Yang gets to them first and tells what really happened. With every agency under its own authority and the possibility of inter-agency war looming, the Army arrests Director Kim, leaving Agent Yu and Colonel Min helpless and confused. Realizing their fate, they call their families to say goodbye. Prime Minister Choi Kyu-hah ascends to the presidency, and the fates of those involved at the party - most of them executed - are listed.

The material that makes up the series was originally filmed in 2003 for another, more general series, Atheism: A Rough History of Disbelief, but was too lengthy for inclusion. Instead, the BBC agreed to create The Atheism Tapes as a supplementary series of six programmes, each consisting of an extended interview with one contributor.  Programmes  All six programmes were conducted in the form of interviews; the synopses below are summaries of the interviewees' responses to Miller's questions. =Colin McGinn= English philosopher McGinn speaks about the various reasons for not believing in God, and some of the reasons for. He gives a thorough treatment of the ontological argument. In addition, McGinn draws an important distinction between atheism (lack of belief in a deity) and antitheism (active opposition to theism); he identifies himself as both an atheist and an antitheist. Finally, he speculates about a post-theistic society. =Steven Weinberg= American physicist Weinberg talks about the effectiveness of the Design Argument, both in the past and today. He also discusses the reasons that people become religious, including the varying influences of physical and biological arguments against religion. Miller connects this to a higher likelihood of biologists being non-believers than physicists, which Weinberg finds surprising. Weinberg goes on to distinguish between harm done in the name of religion from that done by religion and states that both of these are very real and very dangerous. He goes on to discuss the difference between religious belief in America and Europe, and about how he doesn't like the \\"character\\" of the monotheistic God. He ends by saying that science is very definitely corrosive to religious belief, and that he considers this a good thing. =Arthur Miller= American playwright Arthur Miller talks about his atheism from a Jewish perspective. He discusses his view that some cases of antisemitism come from Christians who believe Jewish people are disbelievers because they do not believe Christ was the son of God. They also discuss the overlay of religion and patriotism, particularly with American politics, but also on how many of the wars today come from the mixture of nationalism and religious beliefs. Lastly, he explains how he does not believe that there is an afterlife except in the sense that people are remembered by the material possessions that they leave behind or the deeds that they did during their life that still affect the world. =Richard Dawkins= English biologist Richard Dawkins first talks about how the view that evil exists may come from a personification of some principal belief. Next, he explains the process by which he became an atheist despite being raised as an Anglican. They then discuss at length natural selection and how it acts as the guiding force for evolution. He also points out the fallacy in using a God-of-the-gaps argument for explaining the world. Next, he goes over the importance of holding and defending an atheist world view. =Denys Turner= British theologian Denys Turner points out that being an atheist or theist depends largely upon what questions you ask yourself. He then shares his view that atheism can also suffer from its own sort of fundamentalism. They spend some time covering the issue of why or how something comes from nothing. =Daniel Dennett= American philosopher Dennett explains why he called one of his books Darwin's Dangerous Idea, and why many of Darwin's contemporaries, in particular, considered Darwin's theory of evolution to be dangerous. He goes on to deal with the question of consciousness (i.e., is the consciousness/soul distinct from the body), talking about Darwin's rejection of the soul and the possible origins and psychological purposes of a belief in an immaterial soul. Next, he talks about his Christian upbringing and how he became an atheist. He goes on to ask why it is thought rude to criticise religious belief, and suggests that it is due to the influential status of the religions in question. He finishes by wondering whether we could live effectively in a post-theistic world.

From the \\"About Us\\" section of the company's website: :SunCom provides digital wireless communications services to more than 1 million subscribers in the markets with international, national and regional calling plans and access to the largest GSM network in the country. As of the third quarter of 2007, SunCom was providing digital wireless communications services to approximately 1.1 million customers and employed more than 1,900 people. In February 2008, SunCom was acquired by T-Mobile USA, Inc., a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG. The company traded on the NYSE under the TPC ticker symbol. In September 2008, the SunCom brand was phased out and rebranded under the T-Mobile name. History Founded in January 1999 as Triton PCS Holdings by Mark Balfour, SunCom has gone through many deals with other cellular carriers. The SunCom brand was actually used by three separate companies in the beginning, Triton, TeleCorp and Tritel, all working in cooperation with one another and in partnership with AT&T; Wireless. Tritel was purchased by TeleCorp in 2001, with AT&T; Wireless finalizing its purchase of TeleCorp in 2003. By 1995, Suncom was developed and had a significant share of the wireless market. In December 2004, SunCom acquired 29,139 customers from Cingular Wireless as part of a deal of exchanging towers. In March 2005, SunCom sold 169 cell towers in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Puerto Rico to Global Signal Acquisitions. SunCom formed an agreement with Global Signal Acquisitions in June 2005 to lease tower space that they subsequently sold. In October 2005, SunCom agreed to sell the 29,139 customers from the deal in 2004 back to Cingular. On September 17, 2007, T-Mobile USA Inc. announced it would acquire SunCom for approximately $1.6 billion in cash and $800 million in assumed debt. The deal closed on February 22, 2008. Cellular services SunCom's operations provided service across North Carolina, South Carolina, northern Georgia, parts of eastern Tennessee, central Arkansas and southwest Virginia, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Beginning in 2001, SunCom merged with AT&T; Wireless that served states in the Great Lakes area including Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan. This was short lived and lasted only a year. As of 2007, SunCom Wireless provided wireless service utilizing the GSM standard and operating in the 1900MHz PCS frequency-band, except for one 800MHz license in CMA 629 (Myrtle Beach, SC). Originally, SunCom utilized TDMA as its technology platform when it constructed its wireless network in 1999 and began offering service. In 2003, the company began overlaying GSM, along with its associated GPRS technology, completing the upgrade by June 2004 and enabling access across SunCom's footprint. At the time, this was a significant upgrade from TDMA as GSM/GPRS offered more advanced wireless capabilities including data and video transmission. Suncom Wireless operated in two separate and distinct regional areas: one in the Southeast U.S. and one in the Caribbean. =Southeast U.S. operations= Former Caribbean headquarters of SunCom in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The company's Southeast operations provided service across North and South Carolina, eastern Georgia, northeastern Tennessee, and southwestern Virginia. SunCom owned wireless licenses in the \\"28 Basic Trading Areas\\" as defined by the FCC which covered SunCom Wireless's southeast region. These licenses included the major metropolitan areas of Charlotte, Greensboro, Raleigh-Durham-Cary, and Charleston and in aggregate encompass a population of over 14 million people. SunCom Wireless completed the migration of its remaining TDMA Customer Base to GSM on September 30, 2006. In the final days of its operation, SunCom Wireless only operated on the GSM platform. =Caribbean operations= In the Caribbean, SunCom operated in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company owned 3 wireless licenses covering this territory, which had a population of more than 4 million people.

The first vernissage of the exhibition was in Stockholm, July 1998 and attracted much attention. When the exhibition was shown in the cathedral of Uppsala in September it caused a national debate. The reactions was often very emotional, and both positive and negative. The photos portrayed Jesus among homosexuals, transgender people, leatherpeople and people with AIDS. The exhibition toured Scandinavia and continental Europe between 1998 and 2004. An Ecce Homo exhibition opened in October 2012 in the Belgrade Pride festival in Belgrade, Serbia, and was guarded by a number of riot police, due to rioting in the ensuing controversy. The photographs The photos recreated classical Christian motifs, but substituted the persons or the surrounding context with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-related (LGBT) issues and persons. An example of context substitution is the recreation of the motif of Mary holding Jesus (the Piet√† motif), with the surrounding context being that of a medical facility, with Jesus dying from AIDS. The photographs are all connected to, and shown together with, quotations from the Bible and depicts: Annunciation Luk 1:30‚Äì31, Birth of Jesus Luk 2:7, Baptism of Jesus Luk 3:21‚Äì22, Woes of the Pharisees Matt 23:13, The Arriving to Jerusalem Luk 19:37 -40, Last Supper Matt 26:26 -28, The kiss of Judas Matt 26:45 ‚Äì 48, Jesus being weighed down by the cross Mark 15:17 ‚Äì 20, Crucifixion of Jesus Matt 27:45 ‚Äì 46, Piet√†n Joh 19:26, Jesus showing himself to the women Matt 28:9 ‚Äì 10 and Heaven Matt 18:18. Many of the pictures are inspired of classical paintings and all of them are photographed in a modern surrounding. The photographer has deliberately used homosexual models to communicate the likeness between biblical situations of being unaccepted and modern ones, and to show the all-embracing love of God. On the photo of the Last Supper there are transgender instead of homosexual models, as a comment of the fact that Jesus according to the Bible often partook in meals together with people not accepted by society. Controversy As the exhibition toured Sweden, primarily in churches and congregations of the Lutheran Church of Sweden, it sparked an intense debate both from within the church and from other churches. Slides of the photographs were shown in Uppsala Cathedral with the permission of the dean Tuulikki Koivunen Bylund, sanctioned by K. G. Hammar, the archbishop of Uppsala and head of the Church of Sweden. The opinion of Swedish society was deeply polarized, with some considering it to be a radical expression of Christian love while others considered it to be sacrilegious. According to Hammar, \\"We had two piles of letters, they were about the same size all of the time.\\" Some LGBT members of the church described the showing and defend the exhibition as the first time they felt at home in the church and embraced by it. Other LGBT members felt the erotic pictures perpetuated stereotypes about their community, or felt more alienated from the church after the vitriolic debate that followed the exhibition. Tord Harlin, the bishop of Uppsala, described the exhibition as \\"At best it is bad theology, at worst it is blasphemy.\\" Reflecting upon the exhibition in an interview in 2004, K. G. Hammar said: \\"Yes I found the picture difficult at a personal level, but that wasn't the issue. This was about homosexuals, a group who have a hard time to feel at home in the church. Should pictures which in a very charged way illustrated their part in Jesus be removed just because we found them difficult on a personal level? Then we would have sent the signal that the church and the homosexuals are two different worlds which are not to be mixed.\\"An Interview With The Swedish Archbishop ‚Äì Utopia-Politics The photo considered most controversial was the one portraying the baptism of Jesus in a public bathhouse, in which the penis of the Jesus character was visible. As a result of archbishop K. G. Hammar's sanction and defense of the exhibition, the Pope cancelled the planned audience he previously had granted Hammar.

Lang Lang recorded a population of 1,585 at the 2016 Census. The village is just off the South Gippsland Highway near its intersection with the Bass Highway, on the Lang Lang River and borders the region of Dalmore the largest asparagus growing region in the southern hemisphere, Lang Lang also caters to Beef, Dairy farming and Sand Mines. Etymology Lang Lang was formerly known as Carrington, after Lord Carrington. The origin of the name Lang Lang is debated. In the Australian Aboriginal Woiwurrung language, the name Lang Lang, also spelled Laang Laang, meant \\"stones\\" or \\"stony\\". An alternate explanation is that the town is named in honour of an early settler in the region, called Lang. Location and features A Lang Lang post office opened on 20 May 1878. In 1891, after the arrival of the railway, it was renamed Lang Lang West and a new Lang Lang office was opened near the station. A post office known as Lang Lang East opened in 1885 but was replaced by Nyora in 1890, again near the station.

The Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon has the same privilege. Description and use It consists of a doubled shoulder-cape (somewhat like a mozzetta) of white silk ornamented with narrow woven golden stripes, so that the colors alternate white and gold. The first layer of the fanon is placed under the stole and the second over the chasuble, under the white pallium. The two pieces of the fanon are nearly circular in shape but somewhat unequal in size and the smaller is laid over and fastened to the larger one. To allow the head to pass through, there is a round opening in the middle with a vertical slit running down the neckline at the back. The front part of the fanon is ornamented with a small cross embroidered in gold. The fanon is similar to an amice; it is, however, put on not under the alb, but above it. Previously, the pope wore it only when celebrating a solemn pontifical Mass, that is, only when all the pontifical vestments were used. The manner of putting on the fanon recalled the method of assuming the amice universal in the Middle Ages and that continued to be observed by some of the older religious orders. After the deacon vests the pope with the usual amice, alb, the cingulum and sub-cinctorium, and the pectoral cross, he places the fanon on the pope by means of the opening (with the embroidered cross in front), and then pulls the back half of the upper piece over the pope's head. Then he vests the pope with the stole, tunicle, dalmatic, and chasuble, after which he turns down that part of the fanon which had been placed over the head of the pope, draws the front half of the upper piece up from under the chasuble, and finally arranges the whole upper piece of the fanon so that it covers the shoulders of the pope like a collar. The pallium is placed over the fanon. Use Pope Benedict XVI wearing the fanon at Epiphany 2013 The fanon was regularly used until the Second Vatican Council but then fell into disuse, with Pope John Paul II wearing it once in the early 1980s during a visit to Roman convent. On 21 October 2012, Pope Benedict XVI wore the fanon during a canonisation Mass, and again on 25 December 2012, and 6 January 2013. Pope Francis since his election in 2013, has yet to use it. History Pope Innocent III (Fresco at the cloister Sacro Speco, c. 1219) The fanon was mentioned in the oldest known Roman Ordinal, consequently its use in the eighth century can be proved. It was then called anabolagium (anagolagium), and was not yet at that period a vestment reserved for the use of the pope. This limitation of its use did not appear until the other ecclesiastics at Rome began to put the vestment on under the alb instead of over it, that is, when it became customary among the clergy to use the fanon as an ordinary amice. This happened, apparently in imitation of the usage outside of Rome, between the tenth and twelfth centuries; however, the exact date cannot be given. But it is certain that as early as the end of the twelfth century the fanon was worn solely by the pope, as is evident from the express statement of Innocent III (1198‚Äì1216). The vestment was then called an orale; the name of fanon, from the late Latin fano, derived from pannus (penos), cloth, woven fabric, was not used until a subsequent age. Even as early as the eighth century the pope wore the fanon only at solemn high Mass. The usage according to which the pope was vested, in addition to the fanon, with an amice under the alb, did not appear, at the earliest, until the close of the Middle Ages. As to the form of the fanon and the material from which it was made in early times, no positive information exists. Late in the Middle Ages it was made of white silk, as is shown by the inventory of the year 1295 of the papal treasure, as well as by numerous works of art; the favourite ornamentation was one of narrow stripes of gold and of some colour, especially red, woven into the silk. Up into the fifteenth century the fanon was square in shape; the later collar-like form seems to have appeared about the sixteenth century or even later.

An electron density distribution of a molecule is a probability distribution that describes the average manner in which the electronic charge is distributed throughout real space in the attractive field exerted by the nuclei. According to QTAIM, molecular structure is revealed by the stationary points of the electron density together with the gradient paths of the electron density that originate and terminate at these points. QTAIM was primarily developed by Professor Richard Bader and his research group at McMaster University over the course of decades, beginning with analyses of theoretically calculated electron densities of simple molecules in the early 1960s and culminating with analyses of both theoretically and experimentally measured electron densities of crystals in the 90s. The development of QTAIM was driven by the assumption that, since the concepts of atoms and bonds have been and continue to be so ubiquitously useful in interpreting, classifying, predicting and communicating chemistry, they should have a well-defined physical basis. QTAIM recovers the central operational concepts of the molecular structure hypothesis, that of a functional grouping of atoms with an additive and characteristic set of properties, together with a definition of the bonds that link the atoms and impart the structure. QTAIM defines chemical bonding and structure of a chemical system based on the topology of the electron density. In addition to bonding, AIM allows the calculation of certain physical properties on a per- atom basis, by dividing space up into atomic volumes containing exactly one nucleus, which acts as a local attractor of the electron density. In QTAIM an atom is defined as a proper open system, i.e. a system that can share energy and electron density which is localized in the 3D space. The mathematical study of these features is usually referred to in the literature as charge density topology. QTAIM rests on the fact that the dominant topological property of the vast majority of electron density distributions is the presence of strong maxima that occur exclusively at the nuclei, certain pairs of which are linked together by ridges of electron density. In terms of an electron density distribution's gradient vector field, this corresponds to a complete, non-overlapping partitioning of a molecule into three-dimensional basins (atoms) that are linked together by shared two-dimensional separatrices (interatomic surfaces). Within each interatomic surface, the electron density is a maximum at the corresponding internuclear saddle point, which also lies at the minimum of the ridge between corresponding pair of nuclei, the ridge being defined by the pair of gradient trajectories (bond path) originating at the saddle point and terminating at the nuclei. Because QTAIM atoms are always bounded by surfaces having zero flux in the gradient vector field of the electron density, they have some unique quantum mechanical properties compared to other subsystem definitions, including unique electronic kinetic energy the satisfaction of an electronic virial theorem analogous to the molecular electronic virial theorem and some interesting variational properties. QTAIM has gradually become a method for addressing possible questions regarding chemical systems, in a variety of situations hardly handled before by any other model or theory in chemistry. Applications QTAIM is applied to the description of certain organic crystals with unusually short distances between neighboring molecules as observed by X-ray diffraction. For example, in the crystal structure of molecular chlorine the experimental Cl...Cl distance between two molecules is 327 picometres which is less than the sum of the van der Waals radii of 350 picometres. In one QTAIM result 12 bond paths start from each chlorine atom to other chlorine atoms including the other chlorine atom in the molecule. The theory also aims to explain the metallic properties of metallic hydrogen in much the same way. The theory is also applied to so- called hydrogen-hydrogen bonds as they occur in molecules such as phenanthrene and chrysene. In these compounds the distance between two ortho hydrogen atoms again is shorter than their van der Waals radii and according to in silico experiments based on this theory, a bond path is identified between them. Both hydrogen atoms have identical electron density and are closed shell and therefore they are very different from the so-called dihydrogen bonds which are postulated for compounds such as (CH3)2NHBH3 and also different from so- called agostic interactions. In mainstream chemistry close proximity of two nonbonding atoms leads to destabilizing steric repulsion but in QTAIM the observed hydrogen hydrogen interactions are in fact stabilizing. It is well known that both kinked phenanthrene and chrysene are around 6 kcal/mol (25 kJ/mol) more stable than their linear isomers anthracene and tetracene. One traditional explanation is given by Clar's rule. QTAIM shows that a calculated stabilization for phenanthrene by 8 kcal/mol (33 kJ/mol) is the result of destabilization of the compound by 8 kcal/mol (33 kJ/mol) originating from electron transfer from carbon to hydrogen, offset by 12.1 kcal (51 kJ/mol) of stabilization due to a H..H bond path. The electron density at the critical point between the two hydrogen atoms is low, 0.012 e for phenanthrene. Another property of the bond path is its curvature. Biphenyl, phenanthrene and anthracene Another molecule studied in QTAIM is biphenyl. Its two phenyl rings are oriented at a 38¬∞ angle with respect to each other with the planar molecular geometry (encountered in a rotation around the central C-C bond) destabilized by 2.1 kcal/mol (8.8 kJ/mol) and the perpendicular one destabilized by 2.5 kcal/mol (10.5 kJ/mol). The classic explanations for this rotation barrier are steric repulsion between the ortho-hydrogen atoms (planar) and breaking of delocalization of pi density over both rings (perpendicular). QTAIM has also been applied to study the electron topology of solvated post-translational modifications to protein. For example, covalently bonded force constants in a set of lysine-arginine derived advanced glycation end-products were derived using the electronic structure calculations and then bond paths were used to illustrate differences in each of the applied computational chemistry functionals. Furthermore, QTAIM had been used to identify a bond path network of hydrogen bonds between glucosepane and nearby water molecules. In QTAIM the energy increase on decreasing the dihedral angle from 38¬∞ to 0¬∞ is a summation of several factors. Destabilizing factors are the increase in bond length between the connecting carbon atoms (because they have to accommodate the approaching hydrogen atoms) and transfer of electronic charge from carbon to hydrogen. Stabilizing factors are increased delocalization of pi-electrons from one ring to the other and the one that tips the balance is a hydrogen - hydrogen bond between the ortho hydrogens. The hydrogen bond is not without its critics. According to one, the relative stability of phenanthrene compared to its isomers can be adequately explained by comparing resonance stabilizations. Another critic argues that the stability of phenanthrene can be attributed to more effective pi-pi overlap in the central double bond; the existence of bond paths are not questioned but the stabilizing energy derived from it is.

At the height of his career, his column on labor union issues was syndicated to 356 newspapers in the United States.Riley, Biographical Dictionary of American Newspaper Columnists, 1995, p. 265.

May 5, 1956. Background Victor Riesel was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City to Nathan and Sophie Riesel.\\"Tears of Jobless Inspired Riesel,\\" New York Times, April 6, 1956.Nissenson, The Lady Upstairs: Dorothy Schiff and the New York Post, 2007, p. 119.Hamill, \\"The Lives They Lived: Victor Riesel and Walter Sheridan: In Defense of Honest Labor,\\" New York Times, December 31, 1995.\\"The Press: Answer by Acid,\\" Time, April 16, 1956.\\"Mrs. Sopie Riesel,\\" New York Times, May 31, 1966. The family lived in a cold water flat near the elevated railroad tracks. The Riesels were Jewish, and their neighbors were primarily Jewish and Italian American. Victor's father, Nathan, had helped organize the Bonnaz, Singer, and Hand Embroiderers' Union, Local 66, of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union in 1913,Marks, \\"12 Who Made It Big,\\" Newman Library, Baruch College, no date.See, generally, ILGWU, The Fight's Just Begun: Fifty Years with Local 66, 1913‚Äì1963, 1963. and held the Card No. 1 in the local union.Riesel, \\"Remembering the Crusade,\\" Miami News, March 6, 1947. In time, Nathan Riesel was appointed a staff member of the union and elected secretary-treasurer and then president of the local union.\\"Embroiderers Ratify Call for Walkout,\\" New York Times, August 23, 1929; \\"Embroidery Strike Likely Next Week,\\" New York Times, September 4, 1931. Victor attended elementary school at P.S. 19 (now the Judith K. Weiss School). When Victor was three years old, his father taught him to make pro-union speeches and would take his son to rallies and union meetings and have the boy recite the speeches for onlookers.Maeder, \\"Dark Places: Victor Riesel, 1956,\\" New York Daily News, September 22, 1998. Attending union meetings, indoor and outdoor rallies, and standing on street corners promoting the union formed many of Victor Riesel's childhood and teenage memories. In the 1920s and 1930s, Nathan Riesel successfully opposed Communist Party USA attempts to infiltrate activists into the local union and turning its purpose to promotion of the party (a strategy known as \\"boring from within\\").For a history of the \\"boring from within\\" strategy, see, generally: Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States. Vol. 9: The T.U.E.L. to the End of the Gompers Era, 1991; Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States. Vol. 10: The T.U.E.L., 1925‚Äì1929, 1994. Throughout his childhood and teenage years, he saw his father come home bleeding many times after fistfights with communist activists or gangsters. This conflict left a deep impression on Victor. The family moved to the Bronx when Riesel was 13 years old. Academically gifted, Victor Riesel graduated from Morris High School at the age of 15. While in high school, Riesel began typing stories about the American labor movement and sending them to English language newspapers around the world, charging $1 for publication rights. He typed the same story over and over (sometimes as many as 15 times) to make it look like an original (his goal being to sell the same story to many newspapers rather than many stories to a single newspaper), and earned a significant income from this work. He enrolled in City College of New York (CCNY) in 1928, taking classes at night in human resource management and industrial relations. Career Riesel worked several different jobs to support himself, and found employment in a hat factory, lace plant, steel mill, and saw mill. He was appointed director of undergraduate publications at the college, working as an editor, columnist, and literature and theatre critic. He earned his Bachelor of Business Administration from CCNY in 1940. During his undergraduate years at CCNY, Riesel began working as a gofer at The New Leader. After graduation in 1940, he became the magazine's managing editor. Two additional events in Riesel's life led him to a career as a labor reporter. The first occurred on March 6, 1930, during a visit to his father's union offices. Riesel saw a man weeping on the stairs because he had no job and his family had no food to eat. The second occurred in 1942. Nathan Riesel was now fighting organized crime influence in his union, and despaired of keeping his local out of criminal hands. Nathan Riesel was severely beaten by gangsters in 1942, and died five years later (in part due to the injuries suffered during and surgeries related to this attack). =Journalism= Victor Riesel's labor journalism career formally began in 1937 when he started writing a regular column on labor union issues. He was hired by The New York Post in 1941. His column became nationally syndicated in 1942. He left the Post in 1948 after a change in management, and joined William Randolph Hearst's New York Daily Mirror. Within eight years, his column was syndicated in 193 newspapers. His investigation of Communist Party infiltration of the National Maritime Union led Representative Louis B. Heller to introduce legislation in 1951 to investigate the charges. In 1951 and 1952, Riesel provided Senator Pat McCarran with information that led to a Senate investigation into communist influence in the United Public Workers of America. In 1952, he publicly alleged before the Subcommittee on Internal Security (led at the time by Sen. McCarran) that Local 65 of the Distributive, Processing and Office Workers of America was controlled by the Communist Party. The same year, he denounced Gambino crime family member Anthony \\"Tough Tony\\" Anastasio for engaging in labor racketeering. Anastasio sued Riesel for $1 million for libel, but the suit was thrown out of court. On February 6, 1953, Riesel spoke with New York University philosophy professor Sidney Hook and others on \\"The Threat to Academic Freedom\\" in the evening on WEVD radio. In 1956, Riesel began working with United States Attorney Paul Williams to rein in labor racketeering in the New York City garment and trucking industries. =Acid attack= On April 5, 1956, an assailant threw sulphuric acid into Riesel's face as he was leaving Lindy's (a famous restaurant in Manhattan). Riesel had been reporting on corruption in the International Union of Operating Engineers and its then-President, William C. DeKoning, Jr. He had recently alleged that DeKoning was conspiring with Joseph S. Fay (a convicted labor racketeer and extortionist) to re-establish his father, William C. DeKoning, Sr. (who had recently been freed from prison after serving a sentence for extortion) as president of the union. Although Riesel had received numerous death and other threats over the past few months, he had dismissed them as the work of \\"cranks.\\" The attack occurred shortly after a Riesel radio broadcast. Barry Gray, radio station WMCA's overnight talk radio host, had asked Riesel to substitute for him. Riesel invited two IUOE Local 138 leaders who were challenging the DeKonings for control of the local union to join him for the broadcast. The broadcast originated from Hutton's Restaurant at 47th Street and Lexington Avenue shortly after midnight on April 5, and concluded at 2 AM. Afterward, Riesel and his secretary went to Lindy's restaurant, located on Broadway between 49th Street and 50th Street. They had coffee, and departed Lindy's at 3 AM to walk to the secretary's automobile. Riesel removed his eyeglasses, which he did by habit when in public. A slender, black-haired man in blue and white jacket stepped out of the shadows of the entrance to the Mark Hellinger Theatre and threw a vial of sulphuric acid into Riesel's eyes. Riesel shouted, \\"My gosh! My gosh!\\", and clutched at his face. While the secretary and others rendered assistance and dragged Riesel into Lindy's, the assailant walked calmly away. The acid struck Riesel's right eye more than the left. Riesel's eyes were flushed with water inside Lindy's, but patrons stopped administering aid for fear of doing further damage. Riesel was taken to St. Clare's Hospital on East 71st Street, where doctors worked to save his vision. Measures to counteract the acid were not taken until Riesel arrived at St. Clare's, 40 minutes after the attack. On May 4, doctors said that Riesel had completely lost his sight (see the right photograph in the infobox, above). In December 1956, Riesel described the amount of acid as a \\"deluge\\" which covered most of his cheeks, eyes, and forehead.Ranzal, \\"Riesel, on the Stand, Describes How Acid 'Deluge' Hit His Eyes,\\" New York Times, December 4, 1956.In fact, there was so much acid thrown that some of it splashed back onto attacker Abraham Telvi's face. Telvi's scars made him easily identifiable as Riesel's assailant. When Telvi demanded another $50,000 as compensation for remaining in hiding and staying quiet in the case, the Genovese crime family had him killed. See: Levey, \\"F.B.I. Solves Riesel Case,\\" New York Times, August 18, 1956; Perlmutter, \\"Body Is Exhumed In Riesel Inquiry,\\" New York Times, August 22, 1956; \\"Body of Hoodlum Examined Anew,\\" New York Times, August 23, 1956; \\"Johnny Dio and 4 Others Held As Masterminds in Riesel Attack,\\" New York Times, August 29, 1956; Perlmutter, \\"Dio Linked By U.S. To Telvi Murder in Riesel Case,\\" New York Times, August 30, 1956. Portions of Riesel's face (see right photo, above, compared to left photo, particularly the left cheek, jaw line, and jowls; the eyebrows; and the forehead) were permanently scarred as well.\\"Governor Visits Riesel's Bedside,\\" New York Times, April 9, 1956. Riesel wore dark glasses for the rest of his life to hide his damaged eyes, which many people found difficult to look at. The Daily Mirror immediately offered a $10,000 reward for information identifying the assailant and leading to his conviction. The Newspaper Guild of New York, New York Press Photographers Association, Overseas Press Club, New York Newspaper Reporters Association, and the Society of Silurians (an organization of veteran New York City journalists) immediately raised the reward to $15,000. By week's end, donations from labor unions, radio station WMCA, and other groups had increased the reward to $41,000. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified Abraham Telvi as the assailant in August 1956, but Telvi had been murdered on July 28, 1956, by mobsters for demanding an additional $50,000 on top of the $500 he had already received for the crime.Frankel, \\"Johnny Dio and 4 Others Held As Masterminds in Riesel Attack,\\" New York Times, August 29, 1956.Levey, \\"F.B.I. Solves Riesel Case,\\" New York Times, August 18, 1956. On August 29, 1956, Genovese crime family underboss Johnny Dio was arrested for conspiracy in the Riesel attack, pleaded not guilty, and was released on $100,000 bond even though prosecutors later publicly linked him to the Telvi murder.Levey, \\"U.S. Hints New Lead In Attack on Riesel,\\" New York Times, August 19, 1956; Perlmutter, \\"Dio Linked By U.S. To Telvi Murder in Riesel Case,\\" New York Times, August 30, 1956; \\"Reprisal Feared for Dio's Arrest,\\" New York Times, August 31, 1956; \\"Hogan Gets Data in Riesel Inquiry,\\" New York Times, September 1, 1956; Levey, \\"Rackets and Crime Linked in Riesel Case,\\" New York Times, September 2, 1956; Ranzal, \\"Court Cautions U.S. To Speed Dio Case,\\" New York Times, September 6, 1956; Ranzal, \\"Jury Indicts Dio in Riesel Attack,\\" New York Times, September 8, 1956; \\"Dio and Four Deny Guilt in Riesel Case,\\" New York Times, September 11, 1956; \\"Bond of $100,000 Is Posted By Dio,\\" New York Times, October 11, 1956; \\"Indictment of Dio Upheld By Court,\\" New York Times, October 16, 1956. Joseph Carlino, a Dio associate who had hired Telvi to attack Riesel, pleaded guilty on October 22, and prosecutors severed Dio's trial from the others.Stengren, \\"Guilty Plea Made By Riesel Suspect,\\" New York Times, October 23, 1956; \\"2 Trials Granted in Riesel Attack,\\" New York Times, November 8, 1956. Carlino later testified that Dio had ordered Genovese mob associate Gandolfo Miranti to find a hitman and identify Riesel, and that Miranti had contacted Dominick Bando to assist him in finding the hitman (Bando contacting Carlino, who sought out Telvi).\\"The Fall-Out,\\" Time, August 27, 1956; \\"The Team Behind Telvi,\\" Time, September 10, 1956; Ranzal, \\"Jury Hears Story of Riesel Attack,\\" New York Times, November 15, 1956; Ranzal, \\"Dio Directed Attack On Riesel, Trial Told,\\" New York Times, November 28, 1956. Miranti and Bando were then found guilty (Bando pleading guilty at the last moment).Freeman, \\"3 Convicted of Plot In Riesel Blinding,\\" New York Times, December 7, 1956; \\"Guilty Plea Filed in Riesel Attack,\\" New York Times, January 26, 1957; United States v. Miranti, 253 F.2d 135 (1958). Conspiracy charges against Dio were later dropped despite the convictions. Dio's attorney delayed the trial for nearly five months with motions.\\"Riesel-Case Trial of Dio Is Delayed,\\" New York Times, April 25, 1957. When the trial finally began, Carlino and Miranti recanted their pre-trial statements and courtroom testimony, claiming they did not know who had ordered the attack on Riesel.Becker, \\"Key Dio Witness Refuses to Talk,\\" New York Times, May 21, 1957; Ranzal, \\"Dio Case Dropped From Court Docket,\\" New York Times, May 28, 1957. By September 1957, the government no longer sought to prosecute Dio for the attack.\\"Judge Continues Dio's Indictment,\\" New York Times, September 24, 1957. Miranti received 8 to 16 years in prison and Bando 2 to 5 years in prison for the acid attack and another five years for contempt of court.\\"2 In Riesel Case Get Long Terms,\\" New York Times, February 22, 1957; Ranzal, \\"Silent in Dio Case, Thug Gets 5 Years,\\" New York Times, May 25, 1957. Carlino received a suspended sentence for cooperating with the prosecution,\\"Freed in Riesel Case,\\" New York Times, December 14, 1957. and three other co-conspirators were freed after the judge in their case declared a mistrial.\\"Acid Throwing Case Called A Mistrial,\\" New York Times, July 6, 1960. The Daily Mirror paid one witness $5,000 in 1961 for information leading to the identification of Abraham Telvi as the assailant.\\"Mirror Pays Reward,\\" New York Times, March 31, 1961. The attack on Riesel had significant implications for national American labor policy. President Dwight Eisenhower (who had seen Riesel on Meet the Press) told AFL-CIO President George Meany that he was so incensed by the attack on Riesel that he intended to introduce legislation designed to root out corruption in labor unions.\\"Eisenhower to Act on Union Rackets,\\" New York Times, June 6, 1956; Ball, Meet the Press: Fifty Years of History in the Making, 1998, p. 1955. Clark R. Mollenhoff, editor of the Des Moines Register, was so alarmed by the attack on Riesel that he ordered extensive investigations into trade union corruption.Hilty, Robert Kennedy: Brother Protector, 2000, p. 100. Mollenhoff's investigative efforts unearthed much evidence that Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa was engaged in labor racketeering. The attack also convinced Robert F. Kennedy, then chief legal counsel for the Senate Committee on Government Operations, to lead an investigation into labor racketeering. Kennedy's investigations (as well as subsequent labor scandals) led to the establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management.Lichtenstein, State of the Union: A Century of American Labor, 2003, p. 163. This committee's investigations led directly to the passage of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, which imposed financial reporting requirements on labor unions, limited the power of trusteeships, established many member and employer rights.. The acid attack vastly boosted Riesel's national popularity. He began a regular television program on WRCA-TV, and a regular weekly radio program on WEVD.Adams, \\"Air Shows Slated for Victor Riesel,\\" New York Times, June 13, 1956. He continued to write his column, typing it himself while his wife read newspapers and wire service articles to him. =Anti-communist views= Riesel was a militant anti-communist. Initially, his views focused on both fascism and communism. As early as 1939, he joined John Dewey's newly formed Committee for Cultural Freedom, which was opposed to totalitarianism in all its forms.\\"New Group Fights Any Freedom Curb,\\" New York Times, May 15, 1939. In 1941, he told the Union for Democratic Action that Rep. Martin Dies, Jr. was intent on establishing a national fascist police force to suppress freedom of speech in the United States.\\"Dies Called Creator of Political Police,\\" New York Times, July 29, 1942. Riesel's attacks on fascism lessened after World War II, and he focused almost exclusively on communism after 1950. Riesel's attacks on communism extended beyond labor unions. He attacked folk musician Vern Partlow for promoting communism and undermining American national security with his 1945 talking blues song \\"Atomic Talking Blues\\" (also known as \\"Talking Atom\\" and \\"Old Man Atom\\").Cohen, Rainbow Quest: The Folk Music Revival and American Society, 1940‚Äì1970, 2002, p. 85. In 1949, he was named a director of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding Anti- Communist China, a part of the China Lobby.Tucker, Patterns in the Dust: Chinese-American Relations and the Recognition Controversy, 1949‚Äì1950, 1983, p. 255, fn. 35. At least one author alleges that Riesel even cooperated with the Central Intelligence Agency beginning in the early 1950s, providing information on liberal politicians and union leaders.Wilford, The Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America, 2008, p. 246. In the early 1950s, he supported a movement to stop the importation of goods from the Soviet Union into the United States, and for a time longshoremen on the East Coast refused to unload Soviet ships due to Riesel's campaign. During the height of McCarthyism in the early 1950s, he also became interested in purging homosexuals from federal civil service.Nasaw, The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst, 2001, p. 597. He publicly called for a \\"preventive war\\" with the Soviet Union in 1951, and demanded that President Harry S. Truman drop the atomic bomb on Russia and China.Roberts and Olson, John Wayne: American, 1995, p. 347. He strongly criticized Malcolm X for meeting with Shirley Graham Du Bois and Julian Mayfield in the mid-1960s, and accused Malcolm X of fomenting communist conspiracies.Joseph, Waiting 'til the Midnight Hour: A Narrative History of Black Power in America, 2007, p. 112; Horne, Race Woman: The Lives of Shirley Graham Du Bois, 2000, p. 187. In the early 1970s, Riesel became an unofficial advisor to President Richard Nixon. He supported Nixon in his column, discussed labor union issues and outreach to working-class voters with him personally over the phone, and occasionally met with Cabinet members.Sidey, \\"This Is the White House Calling,\\" Life, April 2, 1971, p. 28; Liebovich, Richard Nixon, Watergate and the Press: A Historical Retrospective, 2003, p. 11. Even as late as 1973, Riesel was defending COINTELPRO, a series of covert and often illegal projects conducted by the FBI aimed at investigating and disrupting dissident political organizations in the U.S.Wannall, The Real J. Edgar Hoover: For the Record, 2000, p. 82. Riesel was intimately involved in the Hollywood blacklist of the late 1940s and 1950s. He strongly criticized Samuel Fuller's 1951 Korean War film The Steel Helmet for promoting communism and portraying American soldiers as murderers.Chung, Hollywood Asian: Philip Ahn and the Politics of Cross-Ethnic Performance, 2006, p. 125-126. He also attacked the 1954 pro-union film Salt of the Earth as communistic, and implied that the production's on-location proximity to Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Nevada Test Site was a cover for Soviet spying on the American nuclear weapons program.Lorence, The Suppression of 'Salt of the Earth': How Hollywood, Big Labor, and Politicians Blacklisted a Movie in Cold War America, 1999, p. 78; Biberman, Salt of the Earth: The Story of a Film, 2003, p. 88; Whitfield, The Culture of the Cold War, 1996, p. 145. Riesel saw it as his patriotic duty to publicize allegations of communist influence made against actors, directors, producers, and others (especially those claims made by conservative actors Adolphe Menjou and Ward Bond).Baughman, The Republic of Mass Culture: Journalism, Filmmaking, and Broadcasting in America Since 1941, 2006, p. 38; Pells, The Liberal Mind in a Conservative Age: American Intellectuals in the 1940s and 1950s, 1989, p. 307.Navasky, \\"HUAC in Hollywood,\\" in Hollywood: Social Dimensions: Technology, Regulation and the Audience, 2004, p. 321. As the blacklist lifted, Riesel agreed to allow his column to become a means for blacklisted individuals to admit their offenses, denounce communism, and become active in the motion picture industry again. Along with Hedda Hopper and Walter Winchell, he would meet privately with these individuals, assess the sincerity of their penance, and then work with them to help rehabilitate their careers if he believed they were being honest with him.Bernstein, Inside Out: A Memoir of the Blacklist, 2000, p. 153; Rose, The Agency: William Morris and the Hidden History of Show Business, 1996, p. 156; Ceplair and Englund, The Inquisition in Hollywood: Politics in the Film Community, 1930‚Äì60, 2003, p. 389; Lichtman and Cohen, Deadly Farce: Harvey Matusow and the Informer System in the McCarthy Era, 2004, p. 64. =Later life= Victor Riesel retired from the Daily Mirror in 1963 but continued to publish his syndicated column. Three men who leased coin-operated pool tables to establishments in California sued Riesel for libel in 1965, alleging that his column on racketeering in the vending industry defamed them.\\"Coinmen Sue Columnist,\\" Billboard, April 17, 1965, p. 46. Riesel was elected a director of the Overseas Press Club in 1962, and the organization's president in 1966 (he served a single one-year term).\\"Overseas Press Club Elects New Officers,\\" New York Times, May 1, 1962. Riesel retired his column in 1990. Personal and death Riesel married the former Evelyn Lobelson after graduating from college. The couple had a son, Michael, in 1942 and a daughter, Susan, in 1949. Riesel died of cardiac arrest at his apartment in Manhattan aged 81. His wife, son, and daughter survived him. Notes Bibliography *\\"Acid Throwing Case Called A Mistrial.\\" New York Times.

BFG Technologies branded products were available in North America and Europe at retailers and e-tailers. The company's main headquarters were located in Lake County, Illinois, near Lake Forest. Graphics cards BFG manufactured graphics cards for mainstream to enthusiast level computers. They were known for their Asylum brand; however, the NVIDIA 5x series of graphics accelerators were the last to use that name. They were best known by computer enthusiasts for the OC (Overclocked) versions of their graphics cards, lifetime warranty and 24/7/365 U.S.-based technical support. BFG was among the first graphics card companies to offer cards that were already overclocked from manufacturer recommended speeds. Since then, many other manufacturers have copied BFG's model. Their most recent flagship graphics cards were the BFG NVIDIA GeForce GTX 285 OCX as an air-cooled solution and the BFG NVIDIA GeForce GTX 295 H2OC as a water- cooled solution. While they also manufactured an air-cooled version of the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 295, it was not overclocked. On May 21, 2010, John Slevin the chairman of BFG Technologies, announced that they would no longer be developing graphics cards, as it was not profitable for them.http://www.techpowerup.com/122610/BFG_Tech_Announces_Exit_From_Graphics_Card_Category_Continues_On_With_PSUs_and_PCs.html In August 2010, BFG began the process of liquidation, initially only for the GPU business but eventually expanding to include the entire company. As a result of this, BFG ceased to honor RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) requests for warranty service, repair, or replacement, instead returning the product to the customer with a short letter explaining the situation.BFG Tech Sending Out RMA Denial Letters: Winding Down Business However, PNY Technologies announced that \\"PNY has stepped up and will be working to give BFG customers the ability to exchange their video cards for a coupon to purchase a PNY Video card at a discounted price\\". This exchange program ended on December 31, 2010 and PNY is no longer accepting requests for BFG cards. The BFG brand name of the company was subsequently acquired by Best Data, who also owns the Diamond Multimedia brand. Desktop computers January 5, 2009, BFG Technologies launched its desktop computer line called Phobos that features a touch panel LCD with performance control, BFG Tech graphic cards, liquid cooling solutions from CoolIT and Intel processors. Power supplies BFG Technologies manufactured a full range of power supply units for ATX compatible PCs. BFG's power supply line up had consisted of 530W, 550W, 600W, 650W, 800W and 1000W in the past, but since was refined to separate categories for separate markets. The GS Series consisted of the GS-450, GS-550 and GS-650, 450W, 550W and 650W power supplies respectively, and were sold as mainstream units, rated at peak power and at room temperature and were sold almost exclusively at retail stores like Best Buy. The LS Series was BFG Technologies mainstream series, consisting of the LS-450 450W power supply, LS-550 550W power supply and LS-680 680W power supply. These were rated at continuous power and at a more realistic 40 ¬∞C. The flagship of BFG Technologies' power supply offerings was the ES Series, which only consisted of one model: The ES-800. This unit was not only rated at continuous and 40 ¬∞C, but featured a technology marketed as \\"Frequency Conversion\\" which is a term used to define a method of changing the switching frequency of the power supply to coincide with load. This allowed the unit to be as efficient as possible even at very low loads while conventional designs might have been significantly less efficient at loads below 10%. The ES Series was later replaced by the EX-Series; essentially an ES Series with a modular interface for removal of unused cables. PhysX cards BFG Technologies offered a 128MB PPU that uses Ageia's PhysX processing chip and libraries. The card was only available in a PCI version in retail packages.

It was founded on September 21, 1845, by Ottoman Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I. After 2016 Turkish coup d √©tat attemp Kuleli Military High School along with other Military High Schools is closed and turned into museum. History Kuleli Cavalry Barracks in 1841. Engraving by Thomas Allom, renowned for his illustrations of Ottoman era Constantinople The building of the Kuleli Military High school near the Bosporus. = Ottoman Period (1845-1923) = Kuleli Military High School was established on September 21, 1845, under the name of \\"Mekteb-i F√ºnun-ƒ± ƒ∞dadiye\\" at the Ma√ßka Barracks in Istanbul, now used by the Istanbul Technical University. Due to the building's renewal, the school completed its first year at the Tiled Kiosk (√áinili K√∂≈ük) building, which housed the \\"Mƒ±zƒ±ka-i H√ºmay√ºn\\" (Imperial Music Band) and \\"Z√ºl√ºfl√º Baltacƒ±lar Ocaƒüƒ±\\" (Logistics and Communications Unit) in that period. Following the renewal of the Ma√ßka Barracks, ‚ÄúMekteb-i F√ºnun-ƒ± ƒ∞dad√Æye‚Äù started its second education year with a ceremony at the presence of Sultan Abd√ºlmecid on October 10, 1846. The Kuleli Military High School building, originally the Kuleli Cavalry Barracks, was designed by Ottoman Armenian architect Garabet Balyan and its construction was completed in 1843.Emporis: Kuleli Military High School In 1868, all military high schools were decided to be combined. At that time, four military high schools, including Kuleli, were combined under the name of \\"Umum Mekteb-i ƒ∞dad√Æ ≈ûahane\\" and transferred to the Galatasaray Barracks. When the combination of military high schools turned out to be a failure, it was decided that the schools should go on their own education system separately. For this reason, ‚ÄúMekteb-i F√ºnun-ƒ± ƒ∞dad√Æye‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeniz ƒ∞dad√Æsi‚Äù (Naval High School) moved to the Kuleli Barracks in 1872. Afterwards, the school came to be known as the \\"Kuleli ƒ∞dad√Æsi\\" (Kuleli Military High School). During the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) between the Ottoman Empire and Russia, the school was transformed into a hospital. Therefore, the students and academic staff of Kuleli moved to the Turkish Military Academy building in Pangaltƒ±, Istanbul. When the war ended, the school returned to its building in √áengelk√∂y with the \\"Askeri Tƒ±bbiye ƒ∞dadisi\\" (Military Medical High School) in 1879. The hospital on the ridge outside the school was evacuated and sent to the Military Medical School, because the building had become too crowded. The hospital later moved to the Beylerbeyi quarter. The \\"Askeri Tƒ±bbiye ƒ∞dadisi\\" (Military Medical High School) was transferred to the Haydarpa≈üa quarter in 1910. During the Balkan Wars in 1912‚Äì1913 (First Balkan War), Kuleli Barracks was converted into a hospital again. Some of the students were sent to the Kandilli High School for Girls (Adile Sultan Palace) and some others to the buildings next to the Beylerbeyi Palace. At the end of 1913, the school moved back to its own building. During World War I, the school temporarily moved to the Prinkipo Greek Orthodox Orphanage in B√ºy√ºkada Island near Istanbul for some time. At the end of World War I, the building was abandoned due to the British request in the Armistice of Mudros and allocated as a dormitory for the Armenian orphans and refugees who were deported during WWI. Kuleli Military High School first moved to a military camp, consisting of tents only, near S√ºnnet Bridge in Kaƒüƒ±thane, then one month later, to a police station in Ma√ßka. Because of the British interest there, it was transferred to the old Gendarmerie School near Beylerbeyi Palace (December 26, 1920). = Turkish Republic Period (1923-2016) = Kuleli Barracks was given back to the Turkish troops at the end of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) as a result of the Turkish victory in the Turkish War of Independence (1919‚Äì1923). The British evacuated the Kuleli Barracks and thus the school moved back to its home after a 3-year period on October 6, 1923. The school became a civilian high school by the \\"Tevhid-i Tedrisat\\" bill (a law that regulated education) passed in 1924 and was renamed as \\"Kuleli Lisesi\\" (Kuleli High School). At the end of the same year, it became a military high school again. Also, it took its present name in 1925 as \\"Kuleli Military High School\\". In the Second World War, Kuleli was transferred to Konya in May 1941 according to the mobilization plans. Kuleli Barracks was converted into a 1,000-bed military hospital and the Bosphorus Transportation Command moved there as well. After the Second World War, the school moved back to Istanbul on August 18, 1947, and has been in its historical home ever since. Kuleli Military High School applied the curriculum of the Ministry of National Education for science courses until the 1975‚Äì76 academic year. Afterwards, it began to apply the college system and the education period was increased from three to four years, with the addition of a Prep Class. After 2016 Turkish coup d √©tat attemp Kuleli Military High School & the other military high schools were closed July 31, 2016 with a decree.

PyObjC is used to develop macOS applications in pure Python. There is also limited support for GNUstep, an open source, cross-platform implementation of Cocoa. For Python programmers The most important usage of PyObjC is enabling programmers to create GUI applications using Cocoa libraries in pure Python. Moreover, as an effect of Objective-C's close relationship with the C programming language (it is a pure superset), developers are also able to incorporate any C-based API by wrapping it with an Objective-C wrapper and then using the wrapped code over the PyObjC bridge. Using Objective-C++, the same can be done with C%2B%2B libraries. For Objective-C programmers Cocoa developers may also benefit, as tasks written in Python generally take fewer lines than the Objective-C equivalent. This can be used to their advantage as it enables faster prototyping. History PyObjC's origins date back to 1996, when Lele Gaifax built the original module in September of that year. Among the credited contributors were Guido van Rossum, creator of the Python programming language. PyObjC was rewritten in 2002. Notable additions include the ability to directly subclass Objective-C classes from Python and nearly complete support for the Foundation, App Kit and Address Book frameworks. Later the same year, support was added for non-framework Python builds, as well as subsequent support for the Python distribution included with Mac OS X. Along with these changes came project templates for standalone Cocoa applications for use with Project Builder, the predecessor to the current Apple platform IDE, Xcode. Apple incorporated PyObjC into Mac OS X in 2007, with the release of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. Messages and methods In Objective-C, objects communicate with each other by sending messages, which is analogous to method calls in other object-oriented languages. When an object receives a message, it looks up the message's name, or selector, and matches it up with a method designated the same selector, which it then invokes. The syntax for these message expressions is inherited from Smalltalk, and appears as an object, called the receiver, placed to the left of the name of the message, or selector, and both are enclosed within a pair of square brackets (the square bracket syntax is not inherited from Smalltalk). Colons within a selector indicate that it accepts one or more arguments, one for each colon. Intended to improve code readability, colons are placed within the selector such that when the required arguments are in place, the expression's intent is unambiguous: [myLittleDuck makeSomeNoise:quack eyesClosed:@YES onOneFoot:@YES]; This is distinct from the syntax used in Python, and in many other languages, where an equivalent expression would read: myLittleDuck.makeSomeNoise_eyesClosed_onOneFoot_(quack, True, True) Translating Objective-C selectors to Python method names is accomplished by replacing each colon with a single underscore and listing the arguments within a pair of parentheses at the end, as demonstrated above. Classes Objective-C classes are subclassed in the same manner as a normal Python class: class MyDuck(NSObject): # NSObject is a base Objective-C class. def init(self): self = super(MyDuck, self).init() # An Objective-C idiom, wherein the # subclass instance, self, is instantiated # by sending the superclass its # designated initializer. return self myLittleDuckOne = MyDuck.alloc().init() See also *libffi References External links Ronald Oussoren's warning on Xcode 4.0 Python (programming language) libraries MacOS programming tools ","title":"PyObjC"},{"id":"2843499","text":"John J.

These lights may be dedicated emergency lights, such as a beacon or a light bar, or may be modified stock lighting, such as a wig-wag or hide-away light, and are additional to any standard lighting on the car such as hazard lights. Often, they are used along with a siren (or occasionally sirens) in order to increase their effectiveness. In many jurisdictions, the use of these lights may afford the user specific legal powers, and may place requirements on other road users to behave differently, such as compelling them to pull to the side of the road and yield right of way so the emergency vehicle may proceed through unimpeded. Laws regarding and restricting the use of these lights vary widely among jurisdictions, and in some areas non-emergency vehicles (e.g. school buses) and semi-emergency vehicles (e.g. tow trucks) may be permitted to use similar lights. These non-and semi-emergency lights are also discussed here. Research into the usefulness and potential dangers of these lights is also presented. Emergency vehicle lighting is a sub-type of emergency vehicle equipment.  History  Lighting on an ambulance in the 1970s The use of the blue emergency light originates in Germany during World War II. As a result of the ‚ÄòVerdunkelung‚Äô, a black-out measure for aerial defense from 1935, cobalt blue was regulated to replace the red color used until 1938 in emergency vehicle lights. Due to the scattering properties of the blue color, it is only visible to lower altitudes and is therefore less easily spotted by enemy airplanes. Purpose Emergency vehicle lighting is generally used to clear the right of way for emergency vehicles, or to warn approaching motorists of potential hazards, such as a vehicle that is stopped or moving slower than the rate of traffic, or a car that has been pulled over. It may also be used to provide specific directions to motorists, such as a command to pull over. Some vehicles incorporate a small arrow board to direct traffic. The use of emergency beacons is restricted by law in many jurisdictions only for responding to an emergency, initiating a traffic stop, bona fide training exercises, or when a specific hazard exists in the road. Most private security agencies have special permits that allow them to use beacons in specific areas. It has yet to be determined whether autonomous vehicles will be required to carry lights, or what colors or patterns they might exhibit to warn off aggressive human drivers. Optical types The optical and mechanical characteristics of the lights (Light-emitting diode) used can have a significant effect on the look of the vehicle and how readily it gains attention in emergencies. =Steady burning= The simplest form of lighting is a steadily burning lamp. These may be white lights used on scene to enable emergency workers to see what they are doing, or they may be colored lights that advertise the emergency vehicle's presence. In the latter case, steadily burning lights are often used alongside rotating or flashing lights rather than on their own, though historically some emergency vehicles only displayed steadily burning lights. For example, California Vehicle Code Section 25252 states: \\"Every authorized emergency vehicle shall be equipped with at least one steady burning red warning lamp visible from at least 1,000 feet to the front of the vehicle.\\" =Rotating light= A fire truck responds with rotating red lights in Toronto. The parts and workings of a rotating light: Top The assembled beacon, including an optional mirror to be used when the beacon is placed in the windshield or rear window. Center The beacon, with the mirror removed. Bottom left and right The green dome of the beacon has been removed to show its rotating reflector, stationary incandescent lamp, and electric motor. These revolving lights may contain a single, stationary bulb around which a curved mirror is spun (or which is attached to a spinning mirror), or a lamp with a Fresnel lens. This creates rotating beams of light, appearing to flash when viewed. Larger rotating lights may contain modular or sealed-beam lamps which rotate as an assembly (commonly two or four bulbs, but possibly one or three). To protect the workings of the beacon, a plastic dome often covers the assembly. These domes usually come in solid colors, but in some cases the front and back halves of the dome are different colors. Other beacons use a clear dome with colored lenses on each lamp; in the latter case, these rotating beacons are sometimes referred to colloquially as ‚Äògumball machines‚Äô or sometimes ‚Äòcherry tops‚Äô in the case of red lights. Rotating lights often use a quartz-halogen or conventional incandescent bulb, though some rotating beacons are now made with LEDs rather than bulbs.e.g. Preco‚Äôs 7600 series Rotating lights may be used in lightbars as well as in single beacons. In a modern enclosed lightbar, generally ‚ÄòV‚Äô- or diamond-shaped mirrors are provided between the lamps to give the effect of multiple flashing lights. =Strobe lights= Some emergency lighting is based on strobe lights similar to those used in flash photography. These xenon flash lamps put out a very brief but very bright flash by discharging a large current through a gas which ionizes the gas. The light produced has a somewhat bluish emission spectrum, which makes red lightbars glow a fuchsia-pink color when lit. Strobe lighting did provide intense light which could improve visibility, but the short duration of the individual flash made it necessary to design the electronics to issue multiple consecutive flashes before alternating with the other associated lens pair. This purportedly allowed time for the human eye and mind to key in and observe the source of the light. Since the changeover to LED lighting units, which could easily allow for longer duration illumination time, they have instead chosen to mimic what is actually a shortcoming of the strobe light, and design the LED light head to illuminate with multiple short duration flashes. It has been noted that depending on the surrounding lighting conditions and other vehicle lighting, strobe only warning lighting did not allow for the same level of perception of distance from the source that traditional light bar and incandescent flashing lights would provide, especially on dark highways and similar locations. =LED lighting= I-35W bridge collapse. The lightbars mounted on the cars are LED- based. The illuminated back-up lamps seen in the two cars in the foreground are being used as emergency lights which operate on a different circuit, rather than burning steadily to indicate that the cars are in reverse gear. LED lighting on an ambulance in Toronto LED-based lighting is becoming very popular in the emergency services for several reasons. Light-emitting diodes are small, completely solid state, very power-efficient, long-lasting (as they have no filaments to burn out) and can be seen very easily even at great distances and in sunlight. Whether as lightbars or single beacons, LED-based lights typically use a clear, colorless dome because the light color is an intrinsic property of the LEDs themselves. LED-based lightbars can be made very thin, reducing wind resistance by around 8-10 percent, or made very flat and used in novel applications, for example to flip up under a sun visor. LED lights are often used in a mode similar to conventional strobe lights, however they can be programmed with a wider variety of flash patterns because of their ability to be switched directly by electronics, as opposed to discharging a capacitor through a gas-filled tube. LED lights produce relatively little heat when in use. In colder inclement climates, this has resulted in LED emergency vehicle warning lights (as well as traffic lights) being obscured by the buildup of frost or snow, raising safety concerns. Solutions are being researched to provide a heat source, as necessary in certain weather conditions, to keep LED lights clear of snow and frost. =Modification of stock lighting= A hide-away strobe light fitted into a rightThe vehicle's stock lighting may also be modified to add flashing and strobe effects. This can be done by adding electronics to the existing lighting system (for instance, to create a wig-wag), or by drilling holes in the reflectors of stock lighting and inserting flashing lights in those holes. =Information matrix signs= LED Information matrix sign (black surface) on a police car between the beacon and search lights Some emergency vehicles use signs made up of a large number of light sources (usually LEDs), which can be programmed to display messages to other road users. This can be used to request other vehicles to pull over, indicate a special instruction, or just to display the name of the operating service (e.g. ‚ÄòPolice‚Äô). Mounting types Diagram showing potential mounting positions for internal, body mounted and removable beacons on emergency vehicles Emergency lighting may be fitted to several places on a vehicle, depending on the degree of conspicuity required. Beacons and lightbars are often mounted on the roof for high visibility, while other lights may be mounted on the body, in the grill, or in the interior of the vehicle. = Roof-mounted single beacon = A Michigan State Police cruiser with a single red beacon and hood fin Since their introduction in 1948, rotating beacons have become widely accepted as a means of attracting attention to one's vehicle. Although the use of the single beacon in law enforcement has dropped since the introduction of light bars, they are still used by some police departments, because of their lower cost or due to tradition. One agency that continues to employ traditional red rotating beacons on its patrol cars is the Michigan State Police. Beacons are also occasionally used on construction equipment when a full-sized lightbar would be unnecessary or impractical to attach to the vehicle. While many single beacons use rotating lamps or mirrors, others use strobe lights under a translucent dome to provide an omnidirectional flash. Some smaller and low- cost beacons of the latter type, however, are simply a blinking incandescent bulb. LEDs are also used to light some omnidirectional beacons. The single beacon is also available with a magnetic mount for situations where permanent mounting is impractical. Examples of such situations would be detectives in unmarked vehicles, volunteer firefighters, or managers at freight yards who use an amber light for safety. These ‚Äòmag-mount‚Äô beacons are often round or teardrop-shaped, and are often referred to as ‚ÄòKojak‚Äô lights after the popular 1970s TV detective who used one. =Lightbar= LED lightbar on a police car, also fitted with ANPR cameras Closeup of an older light bar. This light bar has a clear dome under which two rotating lights can be seen. The rotating light on the right is fitted with a red lens, while the left light gives off unfiltered white light. At the extreme left, a siren speaker can be installed behind the grill. Originally, this referred to a simple metal bar on the roof of the vehicle upon which agencies would mount two rotating beacons, as well as other components such as sirens and stationary ‚Äòlollipop‚Äô lights. Soon the beacon manufacturers began producing off-the-shelf complete ‚Äòlightbars‚Äô. Later, the individual components of the lightbar were integrated into a single contiguous unit, with two elongated domes on either side of a siren enclosure. The extended domes allowed for more rotating beacons, additional mirrors, and fixed-beam lights toward the center to replace the ‚Äòlollipops‚Äô. Lightbars may now contain fixed, rotating, strobe, or LED-based lights in various configurations and offering programmable flash patterns. They may include a second, lower, tier of lamps, such as clear halogen ‚Äòtakedown‚Äô lights towards the front to illuminate the vehicle being stopped, clear side-facing ‚Äòalley‚Äô spotlights, additional amber or red towards the rear for scene protection, or directional traffic advisory arrows. The modern trend of locating sirens on or near the front bumper of emergency vehicles has resulted in many lightbar models eliminating the siren housing in lieu of more lighting. Some lightbar variations are specialized to meet certain desires of the agencies utilizing them, such as those using multiple rotating beacons in a ‚ÄòV‚Äô pattern to provide additional illumination to the sides of the vehicle, and those designed to hug the roof of a vehicle to minimize air resistance or present a lower profile for ‚Äòstealth‚Äô purposes. =Body mounted= Body mounted beacon in operation, used to draw attention to the vehicle as it emerges from side roads Some types of light can be mounted on to the outside of the vehicle (usually a permanent install) and these can be used to provide directional lighting in key areas, such as in front for clearing traffic, or to the rear for scene protection. They can also form part of the main lighting arrangement for subtly marked or unmarked vehicles. In this application, the operating service may choose to use lights with clear lenses so as to minimize the possibility of the lights being noticed when not on. Common places to mount such beacons include on or in the grill of the vehicle and on the front of the rear view mirrors, where they can gain maximum visibility. In the UK many emergency vehicles have lights on the side of the bonnet, which helps to warn oncoming traffic when pulling out of junctions. These lights are often strobe or LED types, as they have the lowest profile for purposes of attachment. =Interior mounted= RTA vehicle with interior mounted lights on the rear windshield, along with a lightbar and integrated lighting in the tail lamps A variety of emergency lights may be used in the interior of a vehicle, generally on the dashboard, visor area, or rear deck. Uses range from discreet or temporary lighting for unmarked vehicles and volunteer responders, to additional rear lighting on fully marked vehicles, to a ‚Äòslick-top‚Äô configuration not unlike a full lightbar set. Interior lighting is available in a variety of form factors, ranging from flat LED panels under the sun visors, to halogen or strobe lights mounted on the rear deck, to ‚Äòcherry‚Äô or oscillating ‚Äòteardrop‚Äô lights mounted on the dash. These may be permanently mounted and wired into the vehicle's electrical system, or they may be temporarily mounted and plug into the vehicle's cigarette lighter. They are often fitted with shields which direct the light through the window, but prevent reflections in to the cab. The police car on the right is a slick-top or ‚Äòstealth‚Äô vehicle, lacking the roof-mounted lightbar seen on the traditionally equipped car on the left. The aerodynamic properties of light bars can be important for police applications, as fuel efficiency and drag are concerns in patrol and pursuit. Because of this, some police cars do not have roof mounted lightbars. These \\"slick-top\\" cars mount their emergency lights within the cruiser, generally around the periphery of the windshield or into the leading or trailing edge of the roof. Slick-top police cars also lack the silhouette of a lightbar or beacon, making the car harder to identify as a police vehicle from a distance, especially fore and aft. Because of these visual advantages, these vehicles are sometimes referred to as \\"stealth\\" vehicles. A key disadvantage of relying solely on internal lighting is the number of lights required to achieve true 360 degree visibility, with most lights usually concentrated front and rear. This can limit the application of vehicles for instances such as scene protection. =Vehicle integral= Sometimes, the existing lighting on a vehicle is modified to create warning beacons. In the case of wig-wag lighting, this involves adding a device to alternately flash the high-beam headlights, or, in some countries, the rear fog lights. It can also involve drilling out other lights on the vehicle to add ‚Äòhideaway‚Äô or ‚Äòcorner strobes‚Äô. Scientific research =Perception= A study at Loughborough University in the United Kingdom showed that strobe lighting conveyed a greater sense of urgency to other road users, with the faster the flash the greater urgency, potentially helping to speed the emergency vehicle through traffic. It also concluded that factors such as flash pattern were important, with simultaneously flashing beacons attracting attention far quicker than alternately flashing versions, although this did increase discomfort glare. In general, as light intensity and the number of beacons present increased, the time it took to gain the attention of other drivers decreased. This same study compared different light colors for glare and detection time under both daylight and night conditions. While red and blue both compared favorably with amber for glare under various conditions, some contradictory findings were observed for detection time. When all colors were held at equal intensity, amber had the poorest detection time both daytime and night. However, when the light source was held at constant intensity, the amber filters, which generally let the most light through, had the best detection time. =Potential hazards= There may be a number of hazards to other road users related to the use of emergency beacons, and these effects should be mitigated as far as possible during vehicle design. These potential hazards include: * Photosensitive epilepsy - This is an epileptic reaction to flashing lights in susceptible persons, which can range in severity from an unusual feeling or involuntary twitch to a generalized seizure. This epileptogenic response can be triggered by lights flashing in the frequency range of 10‚Äì20 Hz, regardless of color. While individual light sources used on emergency vehicles generally have much lower flash rates than this,‚Äúneither car indicators nor flashing warning lights on emergency vehicles constitute a risk, of as they are restricted to 2 f/s or less‚Äù the Loughborough study suggests that such possibilities be minimized. It also notes that emergency workers may report distraction and eyestrain unrelated to epilepsy from working under the lights.Cook (2000:¬ß5.3.1) * Glare - A bright light source in a person's field of view can reduce their ability to see other objects. The effect may be exacerbated by rain, windshields, or eyeglasses. The study distinguished between ‚Äòdisability glare‚Äô, where a driver may be temporarily blinded and unable to see hazards in the road, versus ‚Äòdiscomfort glare‚Äô, which is a more general effect from lights which may cause motorists to avert their eyes. The worst effects for disability glare occurred with amber beacons, strobe beacons, and especially bright lights. * Phototaxis - This is the so-called ‚Äòmoth-to-flame‚Äô effect, where the hypothesis runs that some drivers may be so distracted by the beacons that they are ‚Äòdrawn‚Äô to them. The Loughborough study, referencing the February 1998 issue of the U.S. trade journal Tow Times, asserts that there was a lawsuit in the U.S. where a tow operator was found liable for an accident for this reason, though the study authors were unable to locate any supporting scientific research. Usage by country The color of a vehicle's emergency lights is useful to denote the type of vehicle or situation, but the relationship between color and service varies widely by jurisdiction. By far the most common colors for the core emergency services to use are blue and red, and there are some arguments for using both. One study found that for flashing lights, red was more easily perceived in daylight, and blue at night. Furthermore, red has advantages in haze and fog, while blue stands out against traffic at night. On the other hand, a different study found that red had the quickest detection times at night.Cook (2000:¬ß5.1.1) In most of Europe emergency vehicles use blue lights. However, it is a darker specification blue than used in other parts of the world. Red lights are not common in Europe, though they are used in some countries where red has a specific meaning. Police in Finland, Estonia, Germany and Sweden use a forward-facing red light to indicate that a driver must pull over and stop. In the U.K., police cars are outfitted with flashing red lights to the rear which are toggled on/off separately from blue lights to indicate caution. Fire Command units are also equipped with them when being used for command duties. As are certain bye-law enforcement and a small selection of private security companies. Austria, Germany and Sweden also use red on fire vehicles to designate the command post; in other countries a single green beacon sometimes designates the command post. In Sweden, a green strobe will indicate a medical command vehicle. Greece uses red on fire engines, and red along with blue on police vehicles. In Hungary, red is used only along with blue (on right in lightbars and roof integration) by police (including military police and diplomatic escort) and ambulance. In Poland, red is used on designated vehicles, including police and military vehicles, to indicate the beginning and/or end of a convoy (of those type of vehicles). Until recently the National Police in Slovakia used only blue lights, they have recently started using red and blue lights; Municipal and Military Police used blue lights in Slovakia. In Russia and Belarus, traffic police use red and blue lights, while conventional police along with the rest of the emergency services use only blue lights. =Argentina= Argentina uses blue for police, red for fire, green for ambulances, and amber for utility vehicles. =Australia= ACT Police vehicle with red and blue lights. Also seen is an LED message board, which can display static or scrolling text. Victorian Ambulance responding with alternating blue and red flashing lights In Australia, colors are generally regulated at the state level, but there are some commonalities: A Fire and Rescue New South Wales fire truck on scene with red and blue lights  Red and blue  This is used by all State and Federal Police forces, Naval Police, Military Police, Air Force Police and Australian Border Force motor vehicles. Red and blue is also used by all State and Australian Defence Force fire and ambulance services. Civilian Ambulance and most fire units across the country use red and blue lights with State Emergency Service motor vehicles in most states being authorised to use the red and blue light combination (WA SES only fit red and blue lights to Priority One Cliff/Vertical Rescue or Road Crash Rescue vehicles, with all others having red only). New South Wales also allows red and blue to be used by Roads and Maritime Services traffic commanders and traffic response crews designated as emergency vehicles.  Red  Red lights signify a risk-to- life situation,New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority: Flashing lights and sirens and are used alone by Aviation Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF), Mines Rescue, Western Power, Red Cross blood/organ transport, St John Ambulance Service and all WA State Emergency Service that do not have red and blue. Red lighting used to be in use for fire engines, ambulances and non WA State Emergency Service motor vehicles before they changed to red and blue.  Amber  Amber or yellow lights are used by roadside breakdown vehicles, security patrol vehicles, tow trucks, road construction/repair motor vehicles and most other utility vehicles. Amber is also used by motor vehicles operating in and around airports and docks, this includes Australian Federal Police and Australian Customs vehicles which are fitted with additional amber lighting to supplement their red and blue lightbars. Queensland State Emergency Service motor vehicles are only authorized to display amber lights under certain circumstances.  Green  These are used to denote a stationary ambulance, fire or police command motor vehicle. In Queensland it is also used on some State Forest bush fire units along with the amber. Further, in Queensland, some municipal animal control units use a green and amber light combination.  Blue  Blue lights are reserved for emergency motor vehicles in general, such as police, fire, ambulance, State Emergency Service (except Queensland) and traffic commanders. Blue by itself is also used by airport emergency vehicles to designate a command vehicle.  Magenta  Sometimes referred to as purple, magenta lights are primarily used by heavy vehicle enforcement/escort officers of the NSW Roads and Maritime Services, Victorian VicRoads and South Australian Transport Safety Inspectors. They are also used in combination with amber lights by some council rangersA council ranger is a type of peace officer found in Australia who enforces municipal ordinances, and has limited police powers. and the New South Wales Ministry of Transport. In Western Australia magenta is used by the Department Of Environment and Conservation ‚ÄòHAZMAT Response Unit‚Äô. Magenta is also used in some Escort Vehicles used whilst escorting large mining equipment to the north of the state.  White  White lights are used on most newer emergency vehicles, both as an extra color on lightbars and in the form of ‚Äòwig-wag‚Äô headlights. Many police motor vehicles, and less often other emergency services, also fit LED matrix variable message displays to vehicle lightbars. Such message bars used in New South Wales by the police and fire brigade are capable of displaying numerous messages warning motorists of various hazards or dangers. = Belgium = Belgian law prohibits red lights facing forward and therefore emergency vehicles normally only use blue lights (red lights are allowed at the rear). Other agencies and authorities that are permitted to carry blue lights on their service or intervention vehicles include the customs administration, the military police, the service for the removal and destruction of explosive devices, the governors of the provinces, the civil defense service, the security service of the railroad network, Infrabel and utility companies. =Brunei= Blue is used for police, red for ambulances and combination of red and blue for fire trucks. Yellow is used for buses and trucks such as pick ups and tow trucks. =Canada= A Toronto Fire truck displays red and white lighting A York Regional Police Ford Taurus using blue lights Toronto Paramedic Services ambulance using red lights Generally, red and white are used for emergency vehicles, amber for parking/bylaw enforcement, construction, utility vehicles, Amber and White for security vehicles, and green or red for volunteer firefighters as per various Provincial legislations. Blue is used, along with red, for Police/Peace officers, as well as for snow removal vehicles in Ontario (with Amber for Municipal snow removal and amber and blue for Saskatchewan, Alberta). Purple is used for a funeral. Police now use both red and blue Canada-wide (except where local laws prohibit), including Ontario (thanks to successful testing in Toronto and Ottawa, and changes in the provincial traffic act), where the color blue was only used for non-emergency work.McGuinty Government Continues To Keep Families Safe On Ontario‚Äôs Roads Blue flashing lights are still permitted on snow removal vehicles in Ontario, as long as they are not used in conjunction with flashing red lights. Some provinces restrict municipal peace officers (the exact title varies by province) to a different color; for instance, red-only in Qu√©bec, and amber in Ontario. However, Ontario does permit certain types of provincial enforcement officers, such as Ministry of Transportation, red lights. Officers appointed to enforce the Highway Traffic Act and other statutes use red or red and blue lights as well, such as Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Natural Resources, City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division, Iqaluit Municipal Enforcement Dept, Alberta and Saskatchewan Peace officers, University Constables and others. White flashing lights are common as a supplemental light on emergency vehicles, particularly for fire and ambulance vehicles. In New Brunswick Green is reserved for EMO Command post. In addition to the use of optional green lights, volunteer firefighters often receive special license plate size markings (red letters on a yellow background) to be displayed in place of a front license plate, or in the window of said vehicle. Manitoba allows Red for Volunteer Firefighters.As per Section 38.1(4) & 38.1(5) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act, 1996. Special personal vehicle Firefighter licence plates are also available for those Responders (and retired members) that desire them on a departmental sign-off approval basis by local Fire Departments and through Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI). Quebec allows red for off-road vehicles used within an off-road trail by trails security officers. Utility vehicles generally use amber. Ontario and Newfoundland use blue lights for snowplows, while Alberta uses amber and red for snowplows, and has a public awareness campaign advising motorists that ‚Äúflashing amber and red means snowplow ahead‚Äù.Alberta Infrastructure and Transportation - Snowplows Alberta also allows red lights on certain classes of utility vehicles, such as natural gas utilities which may need to disconnect a gas line in an emergency. While funeral vehicles may also use amber, more recently, some funeral vehicles in Ontario, and more recently Alberta; have begun using purple lights for identification. Often, as a courtesy, motorists yield to funeral processions. However, they are not required to by law. *Red and blue: police; and ‚Äòother non-police law enforcement‚Äô in all provinces and territories. *Red: Fire Department, Volunteer FD responders in certain Provinces (Manitoba, Prince Edward Island); other non-police law enforcement in the provinces of ON and QC and search and rescue vehicles in BC. *Red and white: Emergency Medical Services, St. John Ambulance and private ambulatory services; police services that have not changed over to Red and blue *Blue: Public works vehicles in Newfoundland and Labrador *Amber and blue: snow plows - Manitoba and Ontario (see TAC Snow Removal Equipment Visibility Guide - July 2015 ). *Amber: construction and utility; funeral homes; airport service vehicles (excludes emergency vehicles); private snow removal vehicles (Ontario); Canadian Automobile Association Emergency Assistance vehicles; snow removal (Nova Scotia). *Purple: funeral processions - British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Prince Edward Island. *Green: is now being used by security agencies. It is also being used by emergency service volunteers in certain provinces (including St. John Ambulance in Ontario). Green may also be used by stopped Emergency Vehicles to denote a command vehicle or the site commander, New Brunswick EMO Command post. Volunteer Fire Fighters (Ontario). *White/clear: mall security (Ontario); university campus security (Ontario) =Colombia= Under Colombian law, emergency vehicles are authorized to use lights and sirens to demand priority in traffic. However, rather unusually, it is not specified what types of lights and sirens can be used. Since emergency vehicles are usually imported from other parts of the world, one can see a great variety of light colors and siren types in Colombia. Since most law enforcement duties are consolidated in the National Police, there is some uniformity in police vehicles. Until the early 1990s, these police vehicles were equipped with yellow lights, although today they are equipped with a single red and blue LED lightbar on the roof, and sometimes supplementary red, white, and blue grille lights. Other, more minor law enforcement vehicles (Military Police, CTI, UNP) generally follow the same scheme. Fire trucks are generally imported from the US, and therefore primarily use red lights although European-style fire trucks with blue lights can sometimes be seen and, more rarely, yellow lights as in Spain. Like the US, ambulance service in Colombia is often contracted out to private companies, and some hospitals operate their own ambulance services. These different services outfit their vehicles differently, so there is little uniformity. Also, many ambulances are imported from other countries and retain the lighting schemes of their country of origin. Most ambulances use red or red and white light combinations. However, ambulances operated by the National Police and the Army are equipped with red and blue lights. Some ambulances can be seen with green lights, meaning they were imported from Argentina where ambulances always use green lights. Others still can be seen with yellow lights, like in Spain. As in most of the world, utility vehicles usually use flashing yellow/amber lights. Although only emergency and utility vehicles are allowed to display flashing colored lights, this law is usually not enforced and it is common to see private vehicles customized with colored lights. Taxis commonly display flashing blue lights as decoration, although some taxi drivers install sirens onto their vehicles in order to get around traffic. Many busetas (the traditional, unregulated bus systems in many urban areas) and chivas (rural, informal, public buses) also display colorful flashing lights. = Czech Republic = Special audible warning device (siren) supplemented with special warning in blue color can be fitted to vehicles. Specifically vehicles classified for primary emergency services (state police, professional fire brigades, emergency ambulances) can use from 2019 combination of blue and red lights. Red lights must be installed only on the left side of vehicle, whereas ratio of blue and red lights on vehicle must be 1:1. White flashing light can be used as minor supplementary color in lightbars. Ambulance in Zl√≠n, Czech Republic, With blue LED lights * Ministry of Interior used by the police and identified by special legislation, * the Prison Service, * military police designated by special legislation, *Municipal Police, which determines the municipality, * fire departments, * mine rescue service, * emergency service gas facilities, * emergency medical services and transport sick, wounded and pregnant women, * used by the Armed Forces military rescue units for carrying out humanitarian tasks of civil protection. * the customs administration marked by a special regulation. Amber lights are used for non-emergency warning on many different vehicles - e.g. road construction vehicles, heavy transports, tow trucks, municipal services (dustcarts, road hoovers), ... Other colors for flashing lights or beacons are not allowed. = France = Police Nationale police car with blue lights  Blue  When responding, emergency vehicles (including Police cars) are required to have, at least, one -360 degrees visible- blue light on the roof. French law strictly states what kind of blue lights and sirens an emergency vehicle can display, with 2 different categories. * The first category includes Fire, local and national Police, Gendarmerie, Customs, Penitentiary service, public EMS (SAMU), private ambulances under SAMU contract and government civil defence. These vehicles must use two-tones sirens and beacons with a rotating effect, and/or lightbars with flashing or rotating effects. They can also use two additional blue, flashing, front-facing lights. * The second category includes other private ambulances, blood/organ transport, railroad security, snow plows, highway maintenance/safety and electricity/gas units which respond to incidents and Banque de France transport trucks. These vehicles must only use three-tones sirens (except snow plows) and beacons with a flashing effect, and/or lightbars with flashing effects.  Amber  For any emergency vehicle, amber lights can be used with or without blue, to warn other drivers the emergency vehicle is stopped or slow. Non-emergency vehicles allowed to use amber include agricultural, construction, utility, oversized, tow and airport vehicles.  Green or red  These are not considered emergency lights, but are often used on the roof of command vehicles at the scene of incidents. = Germany = German emergency vehicles (all blue beacons) Only emergency and police vehicle may use blue lights. This includes firefighters, rescue services, emergency response vehicles for public utilities and civil defense units. All other kinds of blue lights (e.g. car floor lighting or cab interior lights), including reflective stickers or paintings, are illegal on public roads.¬ß52 Abs 3 Stra√üenverkehrszulassungsordnung Flashing blue lights and sirens may only be used by authorized vehicles in case of emergency and order all other vehicles to make way, since these vehicles have the absolute right of way. Blue lights alone may be used to secure the site of an accident (or a standing emergency vehicle). Sometimes, columns of emergency or police vehicles use blue lights (without sirens) to make the column more visible to other vehicles.¬ß38 Stra√üenverkehrsordnung Blue and yellow are the only colours of flashing lights legal for use on moving vehicles. Other colours, such as red or green are sometimes used to show vehicles of special functions, such as incident command, when stationary. German police lightbars often have ‚ÄòPOLIZEI‚Äô written in white over the dome, and usually incorporate an LED text display that can read, in mirrored writing if towards the front, ‚ÄòHALT POLIZEI‚Äô or ‚ÄòBITTE FOLGEN‚Äô (‚Äòplease follow‚Äô), to signal drivers to pull over. In the newest generation, the text display changes between German and English (HALT POLIZEI ‚Üí STOP POLICE and BITTE FOLGEN ‚Üí FOLLOW ME). = Greece = Police used to have blue-colored emergency lights but after a recent restock of vehicles, now the use of both blue and red color is usual. Fire Departments make use of red only emergency light while ambulances either use red or both colors. Regulation also states that the Military as well as vehicles carrying politicians can make use of a single rotating blue light at the roof. Every other individual and/or company may use yellow lights for either warning or emergency. Special groups like Emergency Response teams and agents may also include emergency lights on their private vehicles in case of an emergency when not in active duty. All utility vehicles such as construction related, tow trucks must be equipped with a yellow-colored emergency light bar on the top, clearly visible from the front and rear side. The same applies for private security firm vehicles, that are in generally treated like typical private cars. =Hong Kong= Under Hong Kong Law, Chapter 374G of the Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations: Section 46 Giving way to animals, police vehicles, ambulances, etc., drivers must yield to vehicles which are sounding siren and/or flashing light bars. *Red and blue: Hong Kong Police Force *Red only: Fire Services Department fire engines *Blue only: Ambulances, whether operated by Fire Services Department, Auxiliary Medical Services, or Hong Kong St. John Ambulance; Customs and Excise Department, Hong Kong Correctional Services *Amber only: Utility vehicles, Civil Aid Service, all vehicles in the air-side of the airport (for pilots' visibility), Hong Kong Immigration Department vehicles = Hungary =  Blue lights only  These are used by police, ambulance service, emergency blood transport, fire brigade, emergency response teams (public services), correction facilities.  Blue and red  Used on most police and ambulance, and on some types of fire vehicles, but red is to be used only in combo with blue. Ambulances usually have large integrated roof corner flash lights, 3 blue ones and 1 red at front right position, and 3-5 or more smaller red/blue flash lights on mirrors, hood, grill, side and back, mounted and used in a zig-zag pattern. Separately-mounted external lightbars on ambulances are rare, used just on doctor's cars and older vans. Police cruisers usually have a lightbar similar to that of German units (Hella 3) with red and blue lights (red on right, like on ambulances), a blue flash behind the windscreen, and additional blue flash lights in the grill. Since Dec 2017, new police lightbars feature integrated LED matrix to display messages to front (mirrored) and rear, alternatively changing text in Hungarian and English. Some police units often use additional lighting, e.g. strobe lights, alternating headlight flash, behind-windshield blue/red lights. Detachable blue flash lamps are occasionally used by unmarked cars of special police forces, by personal transport services for government members, and diplomatic convoy/escort vehicles.  Amber  Amber or yellow flashing lights and lightbars are for warning some special attribute (e.g. oversized, slow, parking at unexpected places etc.) of vehicles like garbage trucks, road cleaning/control/repair, snow plow, car assistance services, construction, transporting dangerous materials etc. Amber/yellow lights do not grant traffic privileges, except to go in the opposite direction in one-way streets or driving on the opposite side in some cases, e.g. road cleaning. * =Indonesia= Under the Indonesian Legislation number 22 year of 2009 section 59 the colors and users of lightbars are: *Blue: Indonesian National Police and escort units *Red: Ambulance, fire brigade, and Search & Rescue units *Amber: Tow Trucks, and Road engineer vehicles = Ireland= A Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance responding with flashing blue lights  Blue lights  Usage of emergency vehicle lighting is restricted in Ireland through the Road Traffic Lighting of Vehicles (Blue and Amber Lamps) Regulations 2011. The main colour for emergency service vehicles is overwhelmingly blue, although there is also widespread use of flashing (white) headlights, and many police vehicles have a set of two rear-facing red flashing lights to indicate that the police car is stopped or to indicate caution. The use of blue lights not exceeding 50w are limited to vehicles being used: * By a member of the Garda S√≠och√°na in the performance of his or her duties as such member. * As a fire brigade vehicle. This Includes a vehicle used by senior fire officers in the performance of their duty as such officer. *Blue lights in use on a Garda Roads Policing vehicleBy persons providing an ambulance service. *By the Irish Prison Service. *As an Irish Marine Emergency Service vehicle, with or without a trailer. *For the delivery or collection of human transplant organs human blood or human blood products. *Marked Military Police vehicles. Dublin Fire Brigade Foam and Environmental Unit with blue flashing led lights Although not specifically linked to the use of warning beacons, the police, fire brigade and ambulance services (but not the other emergency services listed above) may also choose to allow their drivers to claim legal exemptions from most motoring regulations, such as being able to treat a red traffic light as a give way sign, exceeding the speed limit, passing the wrong side of a keep left/right sign, or parking in restricted areas. (NB: police, fire brigade, ambulance) No qualification other than a driving licence is legally required to use blue lights. However most organisations will insist that their drivers are trained in emergency driving techniques. In 2014 the Emergency Services Driving Standard was launched with the backing of all major emergency services. Amber lights Amber lights grant no priority in traffic and exist purely to advertise the vehicle's presence. The following vehicles may use amber flashing lights on public roads: *Breakdown vehicles. *Road clearance vehicles. *Road works vehicle. *A vehicle being used by a local authority or other person authorised by a local authority in the collection and disposal of refuse. *A vehicle being used in the provision or maintenance of telephone services or of gas or electricity supply. *Customs and Excise patrol vehicles. The following vehicles must display flashing amber lights- *Agricultural tractors (with limited exceptions) *Self-propelled agricultural equipment An amber flashing beacon is compulsory for any vehicle running 'Airside' on any airport. Any vehicle not so fitted, such as an ambulance responding to a medical emergency on an aircraft, has to be accompanied by one so fitted. =Japan= A Japanese police car with a PATLITE AWS light bar NEXCO East Japan patrol car with amber and red light bar Red is the most used color on Japanese emergency vehicles. The Japanese police use light bars mounted on a raised (mechanical) platform to make them more visible over congested streets. Rotating lights are most commonly used. But some newer vehicles have LED light bars installed. Vehicles with any other light color than red are security or engineers. Wig-wag headlights are not used. *Red: Police, fire department, ambulance, and any other certified emergency vehicles (electric power company, gas supplier, railway company, Japanese Red Cross Society, local government, etc). *Amber: Construction/repair/road cleaning vehicles, snow plows, highway maintenance vehicles. *Blue: Voluntary anti-crime patrol vehicles. *Green: Oversized vehicles and their pilot vehicles. *Purple: Roadside breakdown vehicles. = Latvia = Almost all emergency vehicles in Latvia are equipped with roof lightbars that are: * white with white/dark blue colour with smaller EU dark blue lights - Police (Policija), Road police (Ceƒºu policija) * dark blue with smaller white lights + dark blue beacons - Paramedics (NeatliekamƒÅ medicƒ´niskƒÅ palƒ´dzƒ´ba) The gas emergency service (AvƒÅrijas dienests/GƒÅzes avƒÅrijas dienests) and the firefighter cars are equipped with the dark blue beacons on top. The gas emergency service vehicles do not have lightbars. The Police cars are the only ones that have dark blue dash flashers. Amber lights generally designate non-emergency or slow movement vehicles such as tow trucks, tractors, combine harvesters or construction equipment. = Netherlands = The color of emergency vehicle lighting is blue. Vehicles using flashing blue lights and siren have right of way over all other vehicles. Only designated emergency/priority vehicles may use blue lights; this includes police, fire brigade, ambulance service and a few other, smaller services such as the blood bank and some lifeguard organizations. Dutch police vehicles have an LED matrix display, which can show different texts in red lighting. Most often used are STOP POLITIE (ordering a driver to pull over and stop) or VOLGEN POLITIE (ordering driver to follow the police vehicle). Standard Dutch police cars often have the text bar incorporated in the light bar, vans and motorcycles usually have a separate sign on the front of the vehicle. On ambulances, a green beacon indicates the command vehicle when multiple units are responding to an incident - usually this is the first vehicle that arrives on the scene. Newer ambulance models also have a text display that will alternate the words ‚ÄòAmbulance‚Äô and ‚ÄòSpoed‚Äô (‚Äòurgent‚Äô). When ever the vehicles are on scene (usually fire brigade vehicles and some police vans), or staying in place for another reason, they need to switch to amber lighting to signal that they are not moving. =New Zealand= Typical New Zealand Police patrol vehicle with current LED lightbar, LED dash lighting and alternating headlights A St John New Zealand ambulance with red lights In New Zealand, the colors used on lightbars and beacons are defined by the New Zealand Transport Agency regulations. *Red and blue: New Zealand Police. All branches of NZ Police use red and blue warning lights. Prior to 1992 NZ Police vehicle warning lights were all blue to distinguish them from the all red lights of the Traffic enforcement Police which were part of the former New Zealand Ministry of Transport. Tunnel Control vehicles of the New Zealand Transport Agency also use red and blue lights in combination with an amber light. *Red: Used by any vehicle defined as an emergency vehicle to signify vehicles to give way to the emergency vehicle. This includes the FENZ (Fire and Emergency New Zealand), Civil Defence emergency vehicles and recognised ambulance services such as St Johns Ambulance of New Zealand, Wellington Free Ambulance, Auckland Rescue Helicopter Trust and those of the New Zealand Defence Force. *Amber and blue: Used by customs officers, fisheries officers, marine reserve officers. *Amber: Amber lights may be operated by towing companies, traffic management agencies,In New Zealand, a traffic management agency provides civilian flaggers to direct traffic at road construction sites. construction site vehicles and heavy vehicles, or by other utility vehicles when necessary to warn other motorists of a hazard. Amber must also be fitted to oversize vehicles and their pilot vehicles. Vehicles operating in airports and sea ports must display amber lights. Amber lights are permitted on Surf Life Saving rescue vehicles. Enforcement employees of councils (such as Animal Control or Parking Wardens) often use vehicles fitted with amber warning lights. *Green: Green emergency lighting is used by Registered Medical Practitioner, Registered Nurse or Registered Midwife on emergency calls. While it grants no special exemptions, drivers must give way to them. *Purple (magenta): Load pilots escorting a load wider than 5m must display purple beacons to alert other road users there is an oversize load they may need to move out of the way for. Volunteers in general are afforded no special privileges and cannot use flashing lights or sirens in order to navigate traffic. However, in the case of FENZ volunteer operational support members, who respond to calls in their own private vehicles, may be authorized by their unit or brigade to display a red beacon, for reasons of safety and identification. However, these lights may only be fitted and operational while stationary at an emergency scene, not while mobile in traffic. = Norway = Emergency services in Norway use only blue lighting. If a blue flashing light is seen in either traffic or the sea, other vehicles must yield to let that vehicle pass. Blue flashing lights are used by police, military police, customs, fire departments, rescue services, and ambulances. Government, VIP, and embassy vehicles may also use blue if accompanied by local police. Any vehicle equipped with a blue flashing light must have a permission issued by the DMV. The operator of such vehicle must be a qualified emergency vehicle operator and have a ‚Äòcode 160‚Äô endorsement on their driver's license. Blue lights can be used alone or with an additional siren. The siren may not be used alone. The operator of an emergency vehicle may disregard speed limits and traffic lights with caution. Amber lights, however, are not regulated, but are used for any vehicle that need special attention, such as tow-trucks, snow plows, and parking enforcement. Red flashing lights are no longer in use, and were last used in the early 1960s. = Poland = Only designated vehicles (such as police, fire service, ambulances, Internal Affairs, etc.) are permitted to use blue light. The sale of a blue emergency light is permitted; however, the possession of such a light in vehicles (whether turned on or off, visible or not) is strictly illegal. Red lights are used by the first and last vehicle of a convoy of designated vehicles and also are strictly regulated. Amber lights are seeing increasing popularity in recent years, but specific uses are designated according to the Polish Kodeks Drogowy. There are no specific rules governing the use of other colors such as purple, green, or clear lights. = Romania = The three emergency lights used in Romania are red, blue and amber. At a red flashing light, bringing the vehicle to a full stop is compulsory, while for a blue light yielding, slowing down and moving out of the way is compulsory, and an amber light means other traffic vehicles must proceed with caution due to an oversized or slow vehicle. The cars that are allowed to use red lights are the Romanian Police and the Romanian General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations. Cars that are allowed to use a blue rotating light are the Romanian Police (including Local Police), Romanian Gendarmerie, Romanian Border Police, emergency medical services (including SMURD), Civil Protection, Ministry of National Defense, Special Units of the Romanian Intelligence Service, Protection and Guard Service, Ministry of Justice - General Directorate of Prisons, Public Ministry when in mission, National Anticorruption Directorate when in mission, and Financial Guard vehicles. The amber rotating light mean the vehicle and some accompanying vehicles are oversized, overweight, transporting dangerous goods, work as road/street maintenance, are tow trucks, are tractors, or are agricultural vehicles. = Russia = * Red and blue: Traffic police (DPS Dorozhno Patrulnaya Sluzhba Road Patrol Service); FSO (Federalnaya Sluzhba Ohrany Federal Protective Service); FSB (Federalnaya Sluzhba Besopasnosti Federal Security Service) * Blue: Police, ambulance, fire brigade, EMERCOM vehicles, gas emergency service, Central Bank of Russia vehicles. * Amber: Construction and utility vehicles, airport service vehicles (excluding emergency vehicles), snow removal. * White: Russian post, armored cash transport cars. = Serbia = * Blue: Police, ambulance service, fire brigade, military police, military ambulance, traffic police. * Blue and red: First vehicle of a police vehicles convoy or military police convoy. * Amber: Municipality police, utility and construction vehicles, heavy machines, tractors, slow vehicles. = Slovenia = * Blue: Police, ambulance service, fire brigade, military police, military ambulance, traffic police. * Blue and red: First vehicle of a police vehicles convoy. * White: Additional lightbar color, wig-wag on emergency vehicles, accident scene lighting (fire and ambulance) * Amber: Municipality police, utility and construction vehicles, heavy machines, slow vehicles. =South Korea= * Red: Fire department, Gyeongi province ambulances, some police vehicles * Blue: Police motorcycles, some police vehicles, volunteer firefighters * Red and blue: Police patrol cars * Green: Ambulances (some privately operated ambulances use green and red lights) * Yellow/amber: Utility vehicles, Security Company = Spain = The law used to allow only the Cuerpo Nacional de Polic√≠a, Guardia Civil, Polic√≠a Local and autonomous law-enforcement agencies to use blue lights, so in contrast with convention in Europe, civil defense, ambulances (Ambulancia) and fire engines (Bomberos) had to use yellow/amber lights (the only other color authorized, in contrast to convention in which these color lights are used to denote slow vehicles). Some Autonomous Communities allowed other colors, such as blue, red or white (the latter two of which is used by SAMUR in Madrid), however, these are technically illegal to use throughout Spain. In 2018 a new law finally allowed these kind of emergency vehicles to use blue lights, giving them 2 years to make the switch from yellow/amber to blue. Yellow/amber lights are now only used in wide-load trucks and their accompanying vehicles among other special vehicles, such as tractors or tow trucks. A steady burn green light is permitted on taxis available for hire, and was formerly used on buses to indicate a bus was in service and with places free for passengers. = Sweden =  Blue  Rotating blue emergency lighting used in Sweden Police vehicles, medical vehicles and fire engines along with other government vehicles such as the Swedish Military Police and the Swedish Customs Service use white and dark ‚ÄòEuro blue‚Äô emergency lights. Ordinary traffic are required to make way for these vehicles if the lights are on. Blue lights and sirens may also be used on vehicles of that belong to private companies or organizations if their role is either life saving or protecting some vital system of society. This includes but is not limited to medical & public transport, gas & electricity companies and security (specifically, security officers in charge of protecting government buildings and ports).  Amber  Amber lights grant no priority in traffic and exist purely to advertise the vehicle's presence, usually as a warning. Most commonly used on heavy machinery, trucks, bulldozers, slow-going and construction vehicles like are equipped with yellow/amber lights. It is legal to fitt these lights to other vehicles, such as privately owned cars.  Red  The Swedish police use a forward-facing red light to indicate that a driver must pull over and stop. Fire vehicles use a red light to designate the command post.  Green  Swedish ambulances use a single green flashing light to indicate the command post. = Turkey = * Red and blue: Police, gendarmerie, coast guard, military police * Blue: Ambulance, revenue vehicles * Red: Fire brigade, AFAD vehicles * Amber and blue: Municipal police * Amber: Construction and utility vehicles, gas, water and electric emergency vehicles airport service vehicles, snow removal * Green: Funeral vehicles A London Fire Brigade appliance demonstrating blue and white lights. Both blue and white lights on vehicles are protected under legislation. = United Kingdom =  Blue lights  Usage of emergency vehicle lighting is restricted in the United Kingdom through the Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations 1989. It is illegal for any vehicle to show a flashing coloured light (with the exception of the normal direction indicators or a green anti-lock brake warning indicator), unless it is an emergency or other authorised vehicle. However recently pedal cycles can exhibit a flashing rear red lamp and flashing white front lamp.The Road Vehicles Lighting (Amendment) Regulations 2005 Reg 6 The main colour for emergency service vehicles is overwhelmingly blue, although there is also widespread use of flashing (white) headlights, and many police vehicles have a set of two rear-facing red flashing lights to indicate that the police car is stopped or to indicate caution. The legal definition of an emergency vehicle limits the use of both methods to vehicles used for:Definition of ‚ÄòEmergency vehicle‚Äô in Regulation 3 of Later additions and amendments in Regulation 3 of The Road Vehicles Lighting (Amendment) Regulations 2005 and Regulation 3 of The Road Vehicles Lighting and Goods Vehicles (Plating and Testing) (Amendment) Regulations 2009Lightbar incorporating blue lights and white 'alley' lights for night-time searchesAn ambulance responding with blue flashing lights and alternating headlights - 'wig-wags' * Fire, ambulance or police purposes (this includes private ambulances and agencies who can appoint employees to the office of Constable - such as the National Crime Agency, but _not_ private security) *Forestry Commission or local authority when fighting fires *Ministry of Defence bomb disposal, mountain rescue, nuclear emergency or armament support, or special forces responding to a national security emergency *National Blood Service or Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service vehicles *HM Coastguard *Coal Authority for mine rescue *RNLI lifeboat launching vehicles *Mountain Rescue *HM Revenue and Customs when investigating serious crime A Metropolitan Police 'area car' with emergency equipment activated. Such vehicle is considered an 'advanced' vehicle. Blue flashing lights must only be lit at the scene of an emergency, or when the driver considers it desirable to indicate that the journey being undertaken is urgent, and (in terms of the law) convey to other drivers that they should take special care. Although not specifically linked to the use of warning beacons, the police, fire brigade and ambulance services (and in certain cases, the blood services and bomb disposal units, but not the other emergency services listed above) may also choose to allow their drivers to claim legal exemptions from certain motoring regulations, such as being able to treat a red traffic light as a give way sign, (NB: police, fire brigade, ambulance, bomb disposal, and blood service vehicles only) exceeding the speed limit, (NB: police, fire brigade and ambulance vehicles only. Not, apparently, bomb disposal or blood service vehicles.) passing the wrong side of a keep left/right sign, (NB: police, fire brigade, ambulance, bomb disposal, and blood service vehicles only) driving in a bus lane, (NB: police, fire brigade and ambulance vehicles only. Not, apparently, bomb disposal or blood service vehicles.) or parking in restricted areas.‚ÄúRegulations 26(5)(b) and 27(3)(c)‚Äù, The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002 (NB: police, fire brigade and ambulance vehicles only. Not, apparently, bomb disposal or blood service vehicles.) They may not, however, ignore ‚Äòno entry‚Äô signs, drive the wrong way down a one-way street or cross a solid white line in the middle of the road (other than the same exceptions granted everyone else, for example to pass a stationary vehicle). In reality some drivers will disobey other laws at their professional judgement but they do so without any automatic protection from the law. ‚ÄúIn fact he has only three legal exemptions, and these with caveats: he can exceed the speed limit, if proved necessary (but can still technically be prosecuted for dangerous driving or for driving without due care and attention); he can go through a red light, on the understanding that it is treated in the same way as a Give Way or Stop sign; and he can go to the wrong side of a keep left/right sign.‚Äù No qualification other than a driving licence is legally required to use blue lights; whilst provision has been made to require the drivers of emergency vehicles to have suitable training if they will be driving above the speed limit,Section 87 (Prospective Version) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 as inserted by section 19 of the Road Safety Act 2006 this has not yet been brought into force. However most organisations will insist that their drivers are trained in emergency driving techniques for the safety of all on the road. Police forces, specifically, typically have three levels of driving grade, as required by the College of Policing. * Basic - police officers are permitted to drive in accordance with their standard driving licence, obeying all traffic laws and not claiming any exemptions. Blue emergency lights may only be used when performing a stop on a vehicle or when the vehicle is stationary at a scene. * Response - police officers are permitted to drive intermediate-powered vehicles up to approx. 200bhp, utilising blue lights and sirens for emergency response whilst claiming exemptions. * Advanced - police officers may drive 'high-performance' vehicles of 200bhp+, utilising emergency equipment for emergency response whilst claiming exemptions. This level of training is typically offered to road policing units and armed response vehicle officers, who are expected to drive high performance vehicles in a daily capacity. Response and advanced police drivers can be trained in 'initial phase' pursuit, which involves training in safely pursuing a vehicle under emergency driving conditions. Advanced drivers may further be trained in 'tactical phase' pursuit, which involves training in Tactical Pursuit And Containment (TPAC). Amber lights Amber lights grant no priority in traffic and exist purely to advertise the vehicle's presence, except when used by the DVSA or HETO which is a requirement for the vehicle to stop. The Regulations specifies several classes of vehicles which may use amber lights, such as towing, highway maintenance, pilot vehicles escorting an oversize load, and vehicles unable to travel over 25 mph and fitting these lights to other vehicles (such as privately owned or pedestrian) is legal (these beacons are widely fitted to vehicles as wide-ranging as security). An amber flashing beacon is compulsory for any vehicle running 'Airside' on any airport. Any vehicle not so fitted, such as an ambulance responding to a medical emergency on an aircraft, has to be accompanied by one so fitted. A Metropolitan Police 'incident response vehicle' (IRV). 'Response' drivers are permitted to drive IRVs under emergency conditions. Amber lights are also used by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency and the Highways England Traffic Officer Service (with the addition of red lights) to stop vehicles. Other lights Green flashing beacons can be used by Doctors (registered with the General Medical Council). Many doctors now either volunteer or are employed as First Responders for ambulance services and their vehicles will carry the, usually blue, lights used by the service or both blue and green to indicate their profession. Flashing red lights are fitted to the vast majority of police, fire and ambulance vehicles - being used only when the vehicle is stationary to alert other drivers of their presence. 'Rear reds' are also used during large police escorts, with the rearmost vehicle displaying red lights to alert other motorist not to pass. Hazard lights may be wired to function at the same time, to make civilians further conscious of their presence. Rear fog lights may also be used in an alternating left/right pattern. Traffic enforcement vehicle (dvsa) may also used red lighting when stopping a vehicle. Steady checkered lights denote command and control vehicles - these are red and white for fire (one of the few situations where a forward-facing red light may be shown), blue and white for police and green and white for ambulance, and are often fitted in the middle of the light bar. It should also be noted that UK legislation considers all lights, reflectors and reflective material to be lights, and all items either being or resembling special warning beacons (of any colour), such as on preserved emergency vehicles, must be covered and not just disconnected (as this is a separate offence) while on the public highway. Similarly, no distinction is made between lights mounted on light bars and those mounted anywhere else on the vehicle (e.g. headlights, indicators, brake lights) - all are covered by the same regulations. =United States= A California Highway Patrol Ford Explorer with its emergency lights on In the United States, colors are generally regulated at the state and local levels, but there are some commonalities.  Red  * Almost always denotes an emergency vehicle if the lights are facing forward * A near universal exception to this rule is school buses which are allowed to use rear and forward-facing, usually alternatively phased flashing red lights just before, during, and after passenger loading & unloading as a signal for all other traffic to stop. * In Iowa, red lights can also be used on a funeral hearse, but only during funerals. * In Washington state, and Texas, red lights are used on tow trucks, but only if the vehicle is not in motion. Most tow trucks mount rear-facing red lights to be used in sync with the vehicle's normal stop lights. * In Wisconsin, tow trucks are required to be equipped with red lights but such lights may be operated only when the tow truck is standing on or near the traveled portion of a highway preparatory to towing or servicing a disabled vehicle. * In Wisconsin, emergency vehicles must display at least one forward- facing steady-burn red light. Some exceptions are occasionally made for individual vehicles. * In Wisconsin emergency light allows police to use red and blue lighting. No other vehicles in Wisconsin are permitted to use red or blue police lights on department or personal vehicles. * In California, emergency vehicles must display at least one forward-facing steady-burn red light. Some exceptions are occasionally made for individual vehicles. * In New York, emergency vehicles must only display red lighting to the front and sides of the vehicle, with white lighting being optional. Blue lights are only permitted to be displayed to the rear or for use by volunteer firefighters. * In Michigan, emergency road service vehicles such as tow trucks are allowed to use red warning lights only when stationary. * In Missouri, tow trucks and road service vehicles, volunteer firefighters and EMS may use red and blue. Electric companies may use red.  Amber or yellow  * Often used by utility vehicles such as construction vehicles, tow trucks, snow plows, funeral escorts and hearses, security patrol vehicles, postal vehicles or other vehicles which may be stopped or moving slower than the flow of traffic. * Amber is usually the most permissively regulated color. * In California, emergency vehicles must display at least one rearward-facing flashing amber light.(par 36) * In the USA car truck emergency beacon flash amber warning hazard strobe light bar.  White  Required flashing white beacon on top of school buses for a strobe light flashing at the proper period can appear to freeze or have a reverse cyclical motion. * Often used as an optional color on lightbars, usually in combination with other colors to increase visibility, though it may be restricted to emergency vehicles in some states. Some lightbars include separate or integrated steady burn white lights that face forward (\\"takedown lights\\") or to the sides (\\"alley lights\\") to allow for better visibility of objects around the vehicle at night. * White is rarely used as the only color on a lightbar, though some states require flashing white beacons on the rear of school buses as a rear-end collision prevention measure. * Historically, white was used in combination with red bulb lenses in the Federal Signal Corporation Beacon Ray rotating beacon, introduced in 1948 and the later 1960s and 1970s model P A lights equipped with clear domes on through the 1980s, when revolving bulb and reflector type emergency lighting including the later 1970s Twinsonic and Aerodynic lightbars were supplanted with newer strobe types. The four bulb Beacon Ray Model 175 with a clear dome and colored lenses over the bulbs were used extensively in the 1960s by the NYPD with two red bulbs alternated with a white bulb and an amber bulb canted upwards at a 45-degree angle so the amber flash would reflect off upper-floor building windows for added traffic attention/visibility. This clear dome/colored bulb lens combination also found extensive use across the US as fire apparatus and ambulance lighting. * Certain railroad-related machines, like fueling tankers, track maintenance and switching engines, may also use a flashing white light. * In some states, certain government vehicles such as rural mail delivery vehicles use a flashing white beacon.  Green  A security vehicle using green lights in a mall in Florida *Since 9/11 green is used by Homeland Security Agencies and government/private security agencies protecting high risk government and critical infrastructure. *Green emergency lighting is used on vehicles which are protecting nuclear facilities, oil & gas depots, water storage facilities and dams, gas pipelines, airports, defense facilities, maritime facilities, and all other areas which are at a high risk of terrorist attacks. *Green emergency lighting is also used by private security agencies securing certain government buildings and establishments where terrorist organizations may also target. However, in the State of Florida, green is allowed for use by all private security vehicles only in combination with amber lights. (Florida state legislation is pending to also allow flashing clear/white lights in combination with amber/green security patrol lights for added visibility.) *Green and blue emergency lighting is used by some counter-terrorism agencies whilst responding to terrorist incidents, so as to distinguish the specialist agencies from other emergency departments. *In the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, green and blue is used by Homeland & National Security agencies by Municipal Police Forces in addition to counter-terrorism security agencies. *In Washington State, under the provisions of RCW 46.37.185, a firefighter may use a green light on their privately owned vehicle with the approval of the fire chief of the department they are employed by. The green light is used for identification purposes only and does not convey any special rights or status to the vehicle. *In Oregon, and some other states, the ‚Äòcommand‚Äô vehicle at a fire scene may use a green light to identify its location. *In Tennessee, motorcycles in funeral processions use green lights. *In Ohio, snowplows used by the Ohio Department of Transportation use a combination of green and amber lights. *In New York, Connecticut and Indiana, volunteer EMTs use green lights *In New York City, a single flashing green light separated from the other red and blue flashing lights on an NYPD vehicle denotes it as a THV (Temporary Headquarters Vehicle) also known as a Mobile Command Post vehicle and also used on a 2-star Assistant Chiefs marked RMP (Radio Motor Patrol) vehicle to identify it as such. *In Michigan, flashing or oscillating green lights denote municipal vehicles actively removing ice, snow, or other materials from roads.  Blue  *Reserved for law enforcement, firefighters and EMTs. *In New Mexico tow trucks may have blue lights in combination with amber. *In Wisconsin tow trucks may have blue light in combination with amber. *In Minnesota, highway maintenance vehicles display blue in combination with amber. *In Texas, highway maintenance vehicles display blue in combination with amber. *In California, blue lights may only be used on vehicles operated by Peace Officers, as defined under California Penal Code 830.1 to 830.38. (California Vehicle Code 25258(b)) *Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, and Nebraska also use blue lights on snowplows.Alaska Code ¬ß11.13.04.100: Flashing blue lights on vehicles *In New York State, forward facing blue lights are not permitted on any emergency vehicles, an anomaly in the US. The only exceptions to this is on the personal vehicles of volunteer firefighters, which are allowed to display forward facing flashing blue lights when responding to an emergency or federal emergency vehicles such as those used by Homeland Security. *In Kentucky, civilian possession of a blue flashing light is prohibited by state law. Additionally, blue is the color used by law enforcement agencies. *In Arkansas, civilian possession of a blue flashing light is prohibited by state law. Additionally, blue is the color used by law enforcement agencies. *Most New England States does not have a legislation regulating with the color of lights on emergency vehicles with the exception of Massachusetts. Massachusetts police vehicles would have a full blue/white lightbar front and rear with the addition of one red/amber lights facing rear of the vehicle. *Fire Departments would have red lights facing front and rear with one blue/amber light facing rear only. MA, ME, NH, VT utilizes blue lighting for police and red lighting for EMT and fire. The rest of the New England States have red/blue for law enforcement, EMTs and fire. *Southern states such as Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, NC, SC, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana should normally have blue lighting for law enforcement and red lighting for fire and EMS vehicles. *Chicago Police utilizes blue lighting for law enforcement. *In Nevada, Texas, police utilizes red/blue lightbar for law enforcement and red lighting for fire and EMS vehicles.  Purple  Purple is permitted in some states to denote a funeral vehicle and/or coroner's or Medical examiner's office.West Virginia Code ¬ß17C-15-19. Additional lighting equipment. Police Police agencies may use red, blue, or both, depending on the state, along with white and amber as optional colors; although amber is usually restricted to face behind the vehicle. Some police cars have an amber directional control bar, also known as an ‚Äòarrow stick‚Äô, behind the lightbar to direct traffic left or right around the vehicle; these usually have 6 or 8 rear-facing lights that flash in sequence. Some privately operated special police are allowed to display the same colors as regular police, generally, if they receive their special police authority at the state level. This can include railroad, university, hospital, and SPCA and humane society police departments, Animal control and regulatory officers, Fish and Wildlife conservation officers and Federal and State park rangers, and Beach Safety lifeguards that are law enforcement certified. Fire and EMS siren mounted on top Fire and emergency medical services generally use red lights with amber and white as optional colors. Vehicles operated by fire departments, such as fire engines and heavy rescue vehicles, prominently use red, a color with strong cultural associations with the fire service, along with some amber and white. Some more modern fire trucks and airport crash units use a yellow-green color, however. Many fire chiefs‚Äô cars have, in addition to the red lights, a single green beacon to indicate command post status. On the other hand, in Chicago and some nearby communities, fire vehicles show a green light on the right, or starboard, side of the vehicle, reflecting nautical tradition. Emergency medical vehicles, such as ambulances and paramedic fly-cars, generally use white, amber, and red as well. Some states have a specific rule authorizing light colors for EMS vehicles, while some EMS vehicles ‚Äòinherit‚Äô their light colors from the fire or police department they are operated by or contracted to, and may show blue lights. The National Fire Protection Association publishes the NFPA-1901 standards for fire vehicles, which specifies the degree of lighting on various parts of the vehicles, with some flexibility as to color. There is also a GSA procurement specification for ambulances known as KKK-A-1822-F, which many local authorities follow. Volunteer personnel A New Jersey EMT's vehicle at night with lights flashing Many U.S. states allow volunteer fire, EMS and search & rescue personnel to place emergency warning lights in their personal vehicles for use when responding to emergencies. The degree of lighting is mandated by law and also by local custom in most areas, and can vary from a single rotating light on the dashboard or roof, to a setup much like modern police cruisers. Some states also allow volunteer use of sirens and air horns to request the right of way. Virginia state law allows emergency personnel to equip one private vehicle \\"with no more than two flashing or steady-burning red or red and white combination warning lights\\". In some states, volunteers are allowed to use the normal red lights, while in other states volunteers must use some other color, usually blue or green. In the latter case, the lights are used as a courtesy to ‚Äòrequest‚Äô the right of way and generally do not mandate pulling over. Some states, such a Pennsylvania, limit volunteer use of red lights to chiefs and captains of squads. Separate colors may be used for fire versus EMS volunteers. In Connecticut, Indiana, and New York, volunteer firefighters use blue while volunteer EMTs use green. In New Jersey, volunteer fire and ambulance personnel use blue lights in their personal vehicles while responding to their stations. In NJ red lights are only allowed for emergency vehicles, fire chiefs, chief officers of first aid or rescue squads, or other law enforcement vehicles. In Iowa, volunteer firefighters can use flashing blue lights on their personal vehicles, while volunteer EMTs can use flashing white (clear) lights. New York also certifies some volunteer EMTs to use red lights and sirens provided their vehicles carry certain equipment; this is often used by Hatzolah volunteers in the NYC area. Typically in New York state, volunteer firefighters use blue lights in their personal vehicles and volunteer EMS use green lights. This may generate confusion, as green lights are also used to signify an incident command vehicle. In the state of Texas, ‚Äúa private vehicle of a volunteer firefighter or a certified emergency medical services employee or volunteer when responding to a fire alarm or medical emergency‚Äù is considered an ‚Äúauthorized emergency vehicle‚Äù and may use alternately flashing lighting equipment or may be equipped with a siren, exhaust whistle, or bell. The conflicting color assignments can create issues for volunteers who drive their vehicles out of state. One color in their state may mean firefighter or EMT when in another state it may mean police. While some authorities may be satisfied with covering the lights with an ‚ÄòOut Of Service‚Äô tarpaulin, compliance may be more difficult in other jurisdictions. For example, Arkansas bars civilian possession of blue lights on or in a vehicle unless sealed in the manufacturer's original package.Arkansas Motor Vehicle and Traffic Laws ¬ß 27-36-301: Violations Utility vehicles Private security car with amber/yellow lightbar on top Amber lights are often used on vehicle involved in non-emergency work. Most utility companies, towing services, oversize load vehicles, slow vehicles, and certain types of construction equipment mount some type of lightbar or lighting system for a higher degree of visibility. In Detroit, Michigan, Angels' Night volunteers will patrol neighborhoods with yellow lights to help deter vandalism during Devil's Night and Halloween. Typically these lights are the single beacon kind, although lightbars have been used for vehicles of this type, especially on wreckers/tow trucks. In Memphis, Tennessee most city maintenance vehicles (including MLG&W; utility trucks) with flashing lights use yellow lights; however, some vehicles with the traffic engineering department use red flashing lights, especially vehicles equipped with cherry pickers used to repair traffic signals. In states that do not enforce specific rules about green, yellow or white lights, these colors are often used by entities like private security companies which may be ineligible to use blue or red lights but need emergency lights for traffic and site visibility. Security vehicles generally use their lights on private property, in addition some security vehicles are off-road only such as ATV and Golf cart type vehicles. and in most jurisdictions security vehicles are generally not allowed a ‚Äòcourtesy‚Äô or ‚Äòemergency‚Äô status on public roads. Optional colors While certain colors are customarily used by different services, often other colors are optionally used, such as amber and white. Sometimes, this is done to satisfy particular regulations; for example, California requires a steady red light facing forward and a flashing amber light to the rear on every emergency vehicle.

Born at Mortlake (then in Surrey, now in Greater London), he attended Lancing College, Sussex, Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge and taught at King's College London before becoming Regius Professor of English literature at the University of Edinburgh. Wilson was primarily known for two lifelong projects. He was the chief editor, with the assistance of Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, of the New Shakespeare, a series of editions of the complete plays published by Cambridge University Press. Of those editions, the one of Hamlet was his particular focus, and he published a number of other books on the play, supporting the textual scholarship of his edition as well as offering an interpretation. His What Happens in Hamlet, first published in 1935, is among the more influential books ever written on the play, being reprinted several times including a revised second edition in 1959. Wilson's textual work was characterised by considerable boldness and confidence in his own judgement.John D. Cox (as one example among many) discusses Wilson's confidence in editing Henry VI Part 3. Cox, \\"Local References in 3 Henry VI,\\" Shakespeare Quarterly, Vol. 51, No. 3 (2000), 341. His work on the complicated matter of the transmission of Shakespeare's texts‚Äînone of Shakespeare's manuscripts survive and no published edition of any play was supervised directly by the playwright, so all of the texts are mediated by compositors and printers‚Äîwas highly respected, though some of his theories have since been eclipsed by new scholarship.Stephen Orgel, for example, notes that Wilson's \\"confident note\\" to a difficult crux in The Winter's Tale \\"gives no hint of two centuries of uncertainty, debate, and disagreement.\\" Orgel, \\"The Poetics of Incomprehensibility,\\" Shakespeare Quarterly Vol. 42, No. 4 (1991), 432. Some of Wilson's work was questioned sooner; Peter Holland asserts that Wilson and Quiller-Couch's theory of Shakespeare's punctuation was \\"effectively demolished by 1924.\\" Holland, \\"Modernizing Shakespeare: Nicholas Rowe and The Tempest,\\" Shakespeare Quarterly, Vol. 51, No. 1 (2000), 29. However, when the textual principles he painstakingly established did not support the reading that seemed right to him, he would depart widely from them, earning him a reputation for both brilliance and capriciousness; Stanley Edgar Hyman refers to the \\"valuable (sometime weird)\\" New Shakespeare.Hyman, The Armed Vision: A Study in the Methods of Modern Literary Criticism (New York: Knopf, 1955), 184. In his interpretations that juxtaposition was heightened without the support of his arduous textual work. These interpretations included a reading of the famous bedroom scene between Hamlet and his mother that remains influential (if frequently questioned) to this day,Patricia Parker notes that Wilson's is \\"a reading whose controversial history led to its rejection by most editors.\\" Parker, \\"Othello and Hamlet: Dilation, Spying, and the 'Secret Place' of Woman,\\" Representations, No. 44 (1993), 82. but also peculiar ideas about covert Lutheranism and almost completely unsourced speculation about Shakespeare's relationship with his son-in-law. The influential Shakespearean W. W. Greg, Wilson's nemesis, once referred to Wilson's ideas as \\"the careerings of a not too captive balloon in a high wind.\\"Quoted by Hyman, 184.

A controversial theory proposes that hot particles within the body are vastly more dangerous than external emitters delivering the same dose of radiation in a diffused manner. Other researchers claim that there is little or no difference in risk between internal and external emitters. The theory has gained most prominence in debates over the health effects of nuclear accidents, dirty bombs or fallout from atomic weapons, all of which can spread hot particles through the environment. The current ICRP risk model for radiation exposure is derived from studies of victims of external radiation, and detractors claim it does not adequately estimate the risk of hot particles.  Attributes  Hot particles contained in far-traveled nuclear fallout range in size from 10 nanometers to 20 micrometers, whereas those present in local fallout may be much larger (100 micrometers to several millimeters). Hot particles can be identified by a Geiger counter, or by autoradiography, i.e., fogging X-Ray film. Their age and origin can be determined by their isotopic signature. Due to their small size, hot particles may be swallowed, inhaled or enter the body by other means. Once lodged in the body, cells very near the hot particle may absorb much of its radiation, and be bombarded in a very sustained and concentrated fashion. By contrast, an external radioactive source delivering the same total amount of radiation over the whole body would give a relatively minute dose to any one cell.Hot particle dosimetry and radiobiology‚Äîpast and presentThe Hot Particle ProblemHot particles and lung cancer statistics - An old paper, suggesting 1/2000 chance of lung cancer per hot particle induced lesion. https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q;=cache:lSp0zqeNobsJ:docs.nrdc.org/nuclear/nuc_77030001a_17.pdf+Health+effects+of+alpha- emitting+particles+in+the+respiratory+tract.+EPA+Office+of+Radiation+Programs+1976.&hl;=en‚â∑=ca&pid;=bl&srcid;=ADGEESj_RgQY9NjJ8sCkPRZRNDZQDsf0O8CPDHwriViiUkzLJ0dxQRRucDBfnyo6Ju8ZtzBGxkdr8DVv8n55IeaKqj3ERjZodH6UNsYY7gHUrjUqMO3udeynngeZyM8aLqbsAmWrmKvu&sig;=AHIEtbQhH5iElPIJhpsxZedOyMBEHic0AgSome paper suggests a 1 in 10 to 1 in 2 chance for a lesion per hot particle inhaled - http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/28/061/28061202.pdf Estimating health risk The Committee Examining Radiation Risks of Internal Emitters (CERRIE), established by the UK Government, carried out a 3-year-long independent expert review into the health risks of internal emitters (i.e., hot particles) and published its findings in 2003. The study failed to reach consensus, but the conclusion of the majority of its members was that the current ICRP risk model, despite being largely derived from studies of survivors of external radiation, adequately estimates the risk of hot particles, and that any differences between internal and external radiation are adequately accommodated by the established parameters in physiological models (relative biological effectiveness, kinetic factors); i.e., that internal radiation does not seem to be significantly more dangerous than an equal amount of externally delivered radiation. However, they noted significant levels of uncertainty regarding dose estimates for internal emitters, especially regarding less common radionuclides such as 239Pu and 241Am, and even more common ones such as 90Sr. Two of the twelve members disagreed with the overall findings, notably Christopher Busby who advocates controversial physico-biological mechanisms such as Second Event Theory and Photoelectric Effect Theory, by which he believes the danger of ingested particles could be greatly enhanced. Another study largely corroborates the CERRIE findings, though emphasising the paucity of useful data, substantial uncertainties over accuracy, and the existence of evidence for at least some modest \\"enhanced cell transformation for hot-particle exposures\\".  Origin  Hot particles released into the environment may originate in nuclear reactors. The Chernobyl disaster was a major source of hot particles, as the core of the reactor was breached, but they have also been released into the environment through illegal dumping of low-level waste at Dounreay.Hot particles at Dounreay Nuclear Monitor They are also a component of the black rain or other nuclear fallout resulting from detonations of a nuclear weapon, including the more than 2000 nuclear weapons tests in the mid-20th century.Investigating fallout from nuclear testing-Hot Particles and the Cold War, Pier Roberto Danesi Radiation can spread from a more radioactive substance to a less radioactive one by the processes of neutron activation and photodisintegration; this induced radioactivity increases the potential number of hot particle sources. Cold War nuclear tests included safety trials in which fissile material was not detonated, but was sometimes dispersed, including plutonium vapor, plutonium aerosols of various sizes, plutonium oxide particulates, plutonium-coated particles, and sizeable lumps of plutonium-contaminated structural material. Accidents involving satellites and other devices are another source. The crash of the Kosmos 954 satellite released hot particles from its nuclear engine. Accidents during transportation of nuclear weapons or nuclear waste are another potential source.

Design and development Begun in 1938, the X series of designs was Miles designation M.26, covering a wide range of aircraft designs from small feeder-liners to very large 8-engined transatlantic transports. To investigate the design philosophy of the blended wing/body Miles was given a contract to design and build a sub-scale flying model of the X.9 design, which emerged as the M.30 X-Minor. The small size of the X Minor made it impossible to follow the buried engine design exactly; the engines were too large and had to be mounted externally, resulting in an aircraft similar in layout but differing in aerodynamics. The X Minor first flew in February 1942, providing Miles with useful data for several years. A larger scale prototype of the X transport was planned but never built.

She was first and to date only woman from Nebraska to hold a seat in the House. Biography She was born in Randolph in Fremont County in the southwestern tip of Iowa, to Clifton Clark Dodd and the former Erville Reeves. On August 27, 1931, she married Haven N. Smith (May 28, 1909 ‚Äì May 12, 1997). The Smiths died in Sun City, Arizona, where they had resided after 1991. There were no children from the marriage. They are buried in Iowa. Virginia Smith graduated from the University of Nebraska in the capital city of Lincoln in 1936. For most of her adult life, she and Haven lived in Chappell, in Deuel County, in the Nebraska Panhandle and worked as an advocate on rural and agricultural issues. She was a member of the Business and Professional Women's Club and served as national president from 1951 to 1954 of the American Country Life Association. She was a Republican National Convention delegate at each party conclave from 1956 to 1972. Smith was elected to succeed Representative Dave Martin in 1974. In the year of Watergate, she defeated her Democratic opponent Wayne Ziebarth by just 737 votes. However, she never faced another contest anywhere near that close, and was reelected seven more times from what has long been one of the most Republican districts in the nation. Proving just how Republican this district was, her lowest vote share apart from her initial bid was 69 percent in 1986, and she even ran unopposed in 1982. A young Karl Rove, later famous as an advisor to U.S. President George W. Bush, worked on the Smith campaign that year in one of his first election assignments. In 1984, Smith was named \\"Independent Woman of the Year.\\" In Congress, Smith worked to guard funding for rural projects affecting her district and was a vocal opponent of legislative pay increases. She actively sought emergency federal aid for Grand Island after a series of devastating tornadoes swept through the city in 1980. In 1987, she led a drive to roll back a $12,100 pay raise and refused to accept the money when her efforts failed. Smith was a member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, where she was regarded as a swing vote on many Reagan administration priorities. Hers was the critical vote in favor of funding the controversial MX missile in 1982, but she opposed the president's request for funding the Contra rebels in Nicaragua in 1985. National Republicans encouraged Smith to run against U.S. Senator J. James Exon in 1984, but, at seventy-three, she passed on the race and instead ran for re- election. She opted against seeking reelection in 1990 and was succeeded by Republican Bill Barrett. The Virginia Smith Converter Station (near Sidney in Cheyenne County) and the Virginia Smith Dam on the Calamus River (near Burwell in Garfield County) are named for her. Her congressional papers are archived at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln.

The ICSE-affiliated colloquium \\"Science and Engineering for Software Development\\" was being organized in honor of Harlan D. Mills (1919‚Äì1996), and as a recognition of his enduring legacy to the theory and practice of software engineering. The first annual \\"Harlan Mills Practical Visionary Prize\\" award was presented in 1996. This award is given to an individual who has demonstrated a long-standing and meaningful contribution to both the theory and practice of the information sciences.  Career  = Early life = Born in Liberty Center, Iowa. As a young man, Mills studied art with Grant Wood. During World War II, Mills became a bomber pilot in the U.S. Army Air Corps. His skills in flying and teaching were such that rather than having him fly missions, the Army assigned him to train other pilots. = Education = Mills served on the faculties of Iowa State University, Princeton, New York and Johns Hopkins Universities, the Universities of Maryland and Florida, and Florida Institute of Technology (FIT). At Johns Hopkins and Maryland, he initiated one of the first American university courses in structured programming. At Maryland, he developed a new two- semester freshman introduction to computer science and textbook \\"Principles of Computer Programming: A Mathematical Approach\\" with co-authors Basili, Gannon, and Hamlet. At FIT, he developed a new freshman and sophomore curriculum for software engineering using Ada as the underlying language with colleagues Engle and Newman. = Industry = Mills was an IBM Fellow and Member of the Corporate Technical Committee at IBM, a Technical Staff Member at GE and RCA, and President of Mathematica and Software Engineering Technology. At GE, he developed a three-month curriculum in management science attended by hundreds of GE executives. At IBM, he was the primary architect of the IBM Software Engineering Institute where thousands of IBM software personnel were trained in the mathematical foundations of software. He later embodied the mathematical and statistical principles for software in the Cleanroom software engineering process. As founder of Software Engineering Technology, he created an enterprise for Cleanroom technology transfer. = Nation = Mills had an abiding interest in fostering sound software engineering practices through federal programs. During the formative period of the DoD DARPA STARS Program in the 1980s, he provided fundamental concepts for development of high quality software at high productivity. In 1986, he served as Chairman of the Computer Science Panel for the U.S. Air Force Scientific Advisory Board. During 1974-77, he was Chairman of the NSF Computer Science Research Panel on Software Methodology. = Profession = Mills was a program committee member and invited speaker for many professional conferences, and a referee for many mathematics and computer science journals. From 1980-83, he was Governor of the IEEE Computer Society. In 1981, he was the Chairman for IEEE Fall CompCon. During 1975-81, he served as Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.

Patterson had been teaching Koko American Sign Language since 1972, under custody of the zoo. In 1974, Patterson moved the project from a trailer at the zoo to a new compound at Stanford University, yet there was a possibility that Koko would need to be returned to the zoo, so Patterson raised money to buy and keep her. After the purchase, the foundation continued to support Patterson's research as she worked with Koko, in order to research language acquisition by non-human animals. Besides Koko, the foundation also kept two male gorillas: Michael from 1976 until his death in 2000, and Ndume from 1991 until his return to the Cincinnati Zoo in 2019. Koko died in 2018, and after her death followed by the transfer of Ndume, the foundation no longer had any gorillas on which to conduct research.  Beginning  Patterson had worked with Koko since 1972, when she began teaching the then 1-year-old gorilla American Sign Language (ASL). Patterson planned to continue her scientific experiment designed to determine whether, if it were raised using sign language, a gorilla would learn to use language. Patterson fed and cared for Koko as she would her own child, and the pair formed a mother/child emotional bond.http://www.koko.org/world/kokoflix.php?date=2008-01-25 ...but what I came to realize is that there was an obligation, and a bond that I could not ignore. And there was an emotional bond had been formed, just like between a mother and a child.\\" at about 00:30 in. - Patterson Koko was first moved from the San Francisco Children's Zoo to a private trailer on the zoo in 1973, and then moved to a campus at Stanford University in 1974. After purchasing Koko, the foundation moved her into a trailer near Patterson's home in Woodside, California. In 1976, The Gorilla Foundation acquired Michael, a gorilla born in Cameroon who was allegedly orphaned after his parents were killed for meat, as a potential language-using mate for Koko. Activities Patterson and her assistants used simultaneous spoken English and ASL when speaking with the gorillas. Patterson has published several papers claiming that Koko has developed a vocabulary of 1000 to 2000 words and that Koko has invented words and compound words. Under Patterson's criterion for acquisition of a language term, which must be \\"recorded by two independent observers and be used spontaneously and appropriately on at least half the days of a given month\\", Koko had learned 264 signs in the first five and a half years of training. Beginning in the 1990s, the Foundation tried to raise money to move their operation from its sole location in Woodside, California, to a new ape preserve in Maui. They hoped that Koko would successfully mate with her partner, Ndume, who had arrived in 1991, and spontaneously teach their offspring to use sign language. In 2018 Koko died, activating a section of Ndume's loan agreement with the Cincinnati Zoo, which said that Ndume would be placed in an \\"Association of Zoos and Aquariums\\" institution after Koko's death. Patterson tried to prevent the move, citing concerns about Ndume's health, which led to a lawsuit resulting in Ndume's removal in June 2019. According to the Foundation's website, Patterson and other employees have partnered with conservation organizations including International Fund for Animal Welfare and Pan African Conservation Education. The Gorilla Foundation has attempted education projects to decrease the consumption of bushmeat. The Gorilla Foundation is still working toward a great ape sanctuary on Maui. Criticism During a question-and-answer period, in response to a question as to whether her findings would ever be scientifically proven by duplicating them in an independent experiment, Patterson stated that she believes it would not be ethical to do it again because she believes that it is not right to keep such animals in such unnatural circumstances. Patterson was accused of sexual discrimination in 2005 by reportedly expecting female volunteers to show their breasts to Koko. This led to a lawsuit, during which said volunteers were fired. Whether the gorillas actually learned language is debated. Some researchers and linguists have said that most of the signs they used were used chaotically in order to meet a goal, without regard for sentence structure, making them not true language. However, the differences between sign languages and spoken languages have been used to help understand the gorillas' language acquisition, and Koko has been described as using language in advanced ways, such as symbolic descriptions, lying, and making jokes.

Conifers of the World: The Complete Reference. Timber Press. p. 124 is a species of coniferous tree in the Cupressaceae (cypress family). Like the other species in the genus Actinostrobus, it is endemic to southwestern Western Australia. Swamp cypress is a shrub or small tree, reaching eight metres tall. The leaves are evergreen and scale-like, except on young seedlings, where they are needle-like. The leaves are arranged in six rows along the twigs, in alternating whorls of three. The male cones are small, 3‚Äì6 mm long, and are located at the tips of the twigs. The female cones start out similarly inconspicuous, but mature in 18‚Äì20 months to 1‚Äì2 cm with a rounded apex. The cones open and release the seeds only upon drying. They tend to remain closed on the trees for many years, opening only if the branch, or the whole tree, dies. Bushfire kills swamp cypress, but it also causes a great many seeds to be released all at once, resulting in prolific regeneration. In one case, an isolated tree on Jeegarnyeejip Island was killed by fire, and the following winter there were 800 seedlings per square metre within a couple of metres of the original specimen, and about 150 per square metre ten metres away. The species was first collected from Perth in September 1841 by Johann August Ludwig Preiss, and a description was published by Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel in 1845 as Actinostrobus pyramidalis. A 2010 study of the genera Actinostrobus and Callitris found that all three species of Actinostrobus lay within the current concept of Callitris based on analysis of 42 morphological and anatomical characters, hence Actinostrobus pyramidalis was renamed Callitris pyramidalis.Piggin, J., and Bruhl, J.J.

According to Biography and bibliography from the Institute for the Translation of Hebrew Literature , she was born in Vyatka (later renamed Kirov). in Imperial Russia on September 20, 1890, the eleventh daughter of Isser-Leib and Sophia Bluwstein, and granddaughter of the rabbi of the Jewish community in Kiev. During her childhood, her family moved to Poltava, Ukraine, where she attended a Russian-speaking Jewish school and, later, a secular high school. She began writing poetry at the age of 15. When she was 17, she moved to Kiev and began studying painting.Grishaver, Joel L., and Barkin, Josh. Artzeinu: An Israel Encounter. Los Angeles: Torah Aura Productions, 2008. 99. Google Books. Web. October 25, 2011. At the age of 19, Rachel visited Palestine with her sister en route to Italy, where they were planning to study art and philosophy. They decided to stay on as Zionist pioneers, learning Hebrew by listening to children‚Äôs chatter in kindergartens.Band, Ora. Modern Hebrew Prose and Poetry. West Orange, NJ: Fitzroy Dearborn, 2003. 826. ebook3600. PDF file. They settled in Rehovot and worked in the orchards. Later, Rachel moved to Kvutzat Kinneret on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where she studied and worked in a women's agricultural school. At Kinneret, she met Zionist leader A. D. Gordon who was to be a great influence on her life, and to whom she dedicated her first Hebrew poem. In 1913, on the advice of Gordon, she journeyed to Toulouse, France to study agronomy and drawing. When World War I broke out, unable to return to Palestine, she returned instead to Russia where she taught Jewish refugee children. In Russia she suffered from poverty and strenuous labour, as well as the reappearance of her childhood lung disease. It may have been at this point in her life that she contracted tuberculosis.\\"Bluwstein, Rachel\\". Encyclopedia of Modern Jewish Culture. 2004. ebrary. Web. October 25, 2011. Lonely, ill and famished, she had only one hope left: to return to Palestine. In 1919, after the war, she boarded the first ship to leave Russia to Palestine. Rachel's House in No. 64 Street of the Prophets in Jerusalem She returned to Palestine on board the ship Ruslan and for a while joined the small agricultural kibbutz Degania, a settlement neighboring her previous home at Kinneret. However, shortly after her arrival she was diagnosed with tuberculosis, then an incurable disease. Now unable to work with children for fear of contagion, she was expelled from Degania and left to fend for herself. In 1925 she lived briefly in a small white house in the courtyard of the William Holman Hunt House at No. 64 Street of the Prophets in Jerusalem. She spent the rest of her life traveling and living in Tel Aviv, eking out a living by providing private lessons in Hebrew and French, and finally settled in a sanatorium for tuberculosis patients in Gedera. Rachel died on April 16, 1931 in Tel Aviv, at the age of 40. She is buried in the Kinneret cemetery in a grave overlooking the Sea of Galilee, following her wishes as expressed in her poem If Fate Decrees. Alongside her are buried many of the socialist ideologues and pioneers of the second and third waves of immigration. Naomi Shemer was buried near Rachel, according to Shemer's wish. Literary career Rachel the poetess As a member of the editorial staff of Davar newspaper, Zalman Rubashov later Zalman Shazar, who became the third President of Israel, encouraged her to write and publish her poetry. The private life of a Zionist poet and pioneers goes online Her early work was in Russian but she switched to Hebrew. Most of her poems were written in the final six years of her life, usually on small notes to her friends. In 1920 her first poem, Mood, was published in the Hebrew newspaper Davar.Kerbel, Sorrel. Jewish Writers of the Twentieth Century. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 2003. 826. ebrary. Web. October 25, 2011. Eventually the majority of her poems were published there on a weekly basis, and quickly became popular with the Jewish community in Palestine and later, the State of Israel. Rachel is known for her lyrical style, the brevity of her poems, and the revolutionary simplicity of her conversational tone.Eisenberg, Ronald L. The Streets of Jerusalem: Who, What, Why. Israel: Devora Publishing, 2006. 159. Google Books. Web. October 25, 2011. The majority of her poetry is set in the pastoral countryside of the Land of Israel. Many of her poems echo her feelings of longing and loss, a result of her inability to realize her aspirations in life. In several poems she mourns the fact that she will never have a child of her own. Lyrical, exceedingly musical and characterized by its simple language and deep feeling, her poetry deals with fate, her own difficult life, and death. Her love poems emphasize the feelings of loneliness, distance, and longing for the beloved. It also touches upon the hardships and laments of a pioneer reminiscing of times spent in labouring on the land. Her lighter poetry is ironic, often comic. Her writing was influenced by French imagism, Biblical stories, and the literature of the Second Aliyah pioneers. Another major creative influence on Rachel‚Äôs poetry was the Acmeists and their leader, the Russian poet Anna Akhmatova. Rachel‚Äôs style reflects the movement‚Äôs strive for ‚Äúclarity, accuracy, conciseness, and economy of language‚Äù in poetry. In some poems Rachel expresses identification with biblical figures such as Rachel, her namesake matriarch,Mendels, Doron. On Memory: An Interdisciplinary Approach. Germany: Peter Lang, 2007. 344. Google Books. Web. October 25, 2011. and Michal, wife of David. Rachel also wrote a one-act comic play Mental Satisfaction, which was performed but not published in her lifetime. This ironic vignette of pioneer life was recently rediscovered and published in a literary journal.All About Jewish Theatre ‚Äì Hidden play by Israeli poet Rachel Bluwstein (1890‚Äì1931) at www.jewish-theatre.com Awards and recognition Rachel was the first Jewish woman poet in Palestine to receive recognition in a genre that was practiced solely by men. Anthologies of her poetry remain bestsellers to this day. Many of her poems were set to music, both during her lifetime and afterwards, and are widely sung by Israeli singers. Her poems are included in the mandatory curriculum in Israeli schools. A selection of her poetry was translated to English and published under the title Flowers of Perhaps: Selected Poems of Ra'hel, by the London publisher Menard. Poems by Rachel have been translated to English, German, Czech, Polish, Esperanto, Italian, Serbo-Croatian, Hungarian, Basque (by Benito Lertxundi) and Slovak. In his foreword to the 1994 edition of Flowers of Perhaps, the acclaimed Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai stated: \\"What may be most remarkable about the poetry of Ra'hel, a superb lyric poet, is that it has remained fresh in its simplicity and inspiration for more than seventy years.\\" In 2011, Rachel was chosen as one of four great poets whose portraits would be on Israeli currency (the other three being Leah Goldberg, Shaul Tchernichovsky, and Nathan Alterman).Nadav Shemer, Jerusalem Post, 3/10/2011 In 2016, Google Doodle commemorated her 126th birthday.

It held that a non-fraudulent misrepresentation gave no right to damages. This was decided some time before Hedley Byrne v Heller, where damages for negligent misrepresentation were introduced in English law, and it would today be regarded as wrongly decided. Facts During an economic boom in the rubber trade 1910 (at the end of the Amazon rubber boom), Heilbut, Symons & Co were merchants who were underwriting shares of what they claimed was a rubber business, called the Filisola Rubber and Produce Estates, Limited in Mexico. Buckleton called up a manager at Heilbut to inquire about the shares. In response to the questions, the manager confirmed that they were \\"bringing out a rubber company\\". Based on this statement, Buckleton purchased a large number of shares. The company turned out to have far fewer rubber trees than expected. The shares performed very poorly. Buckleton sued for breach of warranty. At trial the Court found that Heilbut made misrepresentation but was not done fraudulently. Nevertheless, at trial it was found that there was a warranty in the statement regarding the rubber company. The claimant, Buckleton, did not succeed at trial. Judgment The House of Lords held that no damages could be payable because it was not a fraudulent misrepresentation. Lord Moulton identified two ways that the action could be successful. First, if the plaintiff could show fraudulent misrepresentation \\"or what is equivalent thereto, must be made recklessly, not caring whether it be true or not.\\" Second, if there was intent (animus contrahendi) to be held to a promise then there may be a collateral contract, that would bind Heilbut to their representation. However, Lord Moulton stated that such collateral contracts would be rare, and on the facts none was found. Lord Moulton said, Significance Although Heilbut, Symons & Co would today be counted as having made at least a negligent misrepresentation, the case still has relevance for the general principle that representations become part of the contract if (as a very general principle) this is \\"intended\\". In Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams[1956] EWCA Civ 5 the Court of Appeal further clarified that the balance of information between a buyer and seller is relevant to determine what was actually intended, giving preference for the intentions of non- commercial parties who rely on others.

Early life Born in Newark, New Jersey, Vreeland enlisted in the Navy as a naval apprentice early in 1866. After a brief service in the he was given a presidential appointment soon afterwards to enter the U.S. Naval Academy on July 27, 1866, graduating from that institution on June 7, 1870, as a passed midshipman. He received his commission as an ensign in November 1873 after a series of cruises onboard screw sloops. Naval career Vreeland was further promoted to master and then lieutenant after successive tours of duty on board the screw steamer , the gunboat and the sloop-of-war . He was then assigned to the Nautical Almanac Office of the US Naval Observatory in November 1881 after a brief period ashore awaiting orders. In March 1884, Lt. Vreeland began a three-year tour at sea aboard the sloop-of-war , after which he was assigned for two years at the Bureau of Navigation. He was then assigned briefly (from July to September 1889) with the Office of Naval Intelligence and reported to the Coast Survey late in October, a posting he took until the spring of 1893, when Vreeland was assigned a series of tours as naval attach√© ‚Äî first in Rome, Vienna and finally in Berlin. After returning home in late 1896, Lt. Vreeland was posted to the battleship in mid-January 1897, and served aboard her until he was transferred to the gunboat at the end of June, whereupon he served through most of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War on blockade duty off the port of Manzanillo until the end of July 1898, even though he was named executive officer of the cruiser in April of that year. He did not actually assume those duties until August 24. He was detached from the Dolphin to serve aboard the on November 6 that same year, but was ordered to the instead on December 30 due to change in orders. Vreeland was promoted to lieutenant commander, and served aboard various vessels in the Asiatic Squadron. He returned home on board the hospital ship in March 1900. From April 1900 to before August 1902 he was a member of the Board of Inspection and Survey, during which time he was promoted to full commander in mid-August 1901. After his duty in the Board, he supervised the fitting out of the new monitor (later renamed the Ozark) and assumed command upon her commissioning on October 28 of that year. Two years later, Vreeland relinquished command of the Ozark and served on shore a series of special assignments for the Department of the Navy for the next few years, during which he received his promotion to captain on April 13, 1906. After finishing his on-shore assignments in Washington, D.C. on April 17, 1907, Capt. Vreeland went to New York Ship in Camden, New Jersey the next day to commission the new . He commanded the battleship for the next two years, which was an auspicious time, for the Kansas was picked to be part of the \\"Great White Fleet\\" that sailed around the world. Soon after the Fleet returned to Hampton Roads on February 22, 1909, he gave up his command of the Kansas and returned home to await orders. On May 10, he succeeded Captain Raymond P. Rodgers as Chief Intelligence Officer, the head of the Office of Naval Intelligence until December 8, when he was succeeded by Captain Templin M. Potts. As his promotion to rear admiral was becoming imminent, he broke his flag in the as Commander, 4th Division, Atlantic Fleet. On December 27, he became Rear Admiral Charles Vreeland. On April 19, 1911, he reported ashore for further duty in Washington. In the newly devised aide system for managing the Navy, Vreeland became one of the four principal advisors of the Secretary of the Navy, George von Lengerke Meyer. As Aide for Inspections, he reached the pinnacle of naval command. During his tenure, he represented the Navy at the coronation of George V of the United Kingdom, as well as heading the so- called \\"Vreeland Board\\" which reinvestigated the sinking of the in 1898, the controversial report of which ‚Äî now widely regarded as erroneous ‚Äî concluded that an external explosion sank the Maine. On December 12, Rear Admiral Vreeland ended his tour of duty as Aide for Inspections and succeeded Rear Admiral Richard Wainwright as the second Aide for Operations. While in that position, Vreeland struggled to improve the defenses in the Philippine Islands, agitated for increased naval construction, particularly of battlecruisers, and supported the development of U.S. naval aviation. It was also during his tenure that naval aviation found a permanent home in Pensacola, Florida. On February 11, 1903, he was succeeded by Bradley A. Fiske as Aide for Operations, and Vreeland finished out his naval career as member of both the General and Joint Boards. He retired on March 10, 1914. Rear Admiral Charles E.

The Battle of Peebles's Farm (or Poplar Springs Church or Poplar Grove Church) was the western part of a simultaneous Union offensive against the Confederate works guarding Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia, during the Siege of Petersburg in the American Civil War. Background In September 1864, Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant planned simultaneous attacks against both flanks of Gen. Robert E. Lee's Confederate army. The eastern attack would be carried out by the Army of the James under Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler against the Confederate works at Chaffin's Farm. The western attack was to be carried out by the Union V Corps under Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren and a cavalry division under Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg with units from the IX Corps and II Corps in support. Opposing forces =Union= =Confederate= Battle Grant had two intentions for Warren. First was to attack the opposite end of Lee's line to relieve pressure on Fort Harrison, which Butler's forces had captured and were holding against counterattacks. The second was to take advantage of the units Lee had removed from his right to retake Fort Harrison. Warren's attack was aimed at the fortifications guarding the Boydton Plank Road, which was being used to carry supplies into Petersburg from the Confederate railhead at Stony Creek to the south. This line was being extended to reach the vicinity of the Union flank at Globe Tavern. While the lines were being constructed a temporary line was held along the Squirrel Level Road. On September 30, the same day Lee was attempting to retake Fort Harrison, Warren and Gregg began marching along the Poplar Springs Road toward the Squirrel Level line in the area of Peebles's Farm and Poplar Springs Church. Lee had indeed pulled forces from this flank for the counterattack on Fort Harrison (including the Light Division under Maj. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox) so Warren was marching against Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's reduced corps. Around 1 p.m. Brig. Gen. Charles Griffin led the attack against the Confederates near the Poplar Springs Church. Griffin quickly captured Fort Archer on the extreme Confederate flank and the Squirrel Level line broke and fled so quickly that prisoners captured were minimal. Warren halted the attack to fortify the new position and not advance too far in front of the IX Corps. The Union attack forced Lee to recall the Light Division from its march towards Fort Harrison (other than Scales' Brigade, which proceeded to Fort Harrison was temporarily attached to General Hoke's force). The IX Corps under Maj. Gen. John G. Parke moved up on Warren's left but did not make an effective link with the V Corps flank. Maj. Gen. Henry Heth was preparing to mount a counterattack, which came about 4:30 and routed the IX Corps and forced one of its brigades to surrender. Warren, who had originally feared a counterattack, now helped rally the broken IX Corps units and check Heth's attack and the fighting died down. Heth tried another flank attack the following day, which was repulsed at the Battle of Vaughan Road, as was a cavalry attack under Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton. On October 2 the Union position was reinforced by Brig. Gen. Gershom Mott's division from the II Corps. Mott spearheaded a Union attack that day, which was aimed for the Boydton Plank Road. The attack easily overran Fort McRae but was checked before it reached the Boydton Plank Road. Aftermath The Confederate defenders lost works on both sides of their lines. The Union army extended the siege lines past the Peebles's Farm area, bringing them all the closer to their ultimate goal of the Boydton Plank Road. The Union army was firmly entrenched in the area and later that month the II Corps would make an attempt to cut the Boydton Plank Road.

Roma rights Thomas Hammarberg is dedicated to strengthening Sinto and Roma rights in Europe, which he believes are ‚Äúshamefully flawed‚Äù. In a number of speeches and statements, Hammarberg actively seeks to improve living conditions for the largest minority in Europe and criticises the alarming levels of racism directed at these people. Hammarberg paints a clear picture of the situation; for example, in his latest report on Italy he heavily criticises the Italian authorities over their treatment of Sinti and Roma people. In 2010, Hammarberg published a comprehensive position paper on the human rights situation of Sinti and Roma, in which he stressed the need for a unified and comprehensive programme aimed at improving the situation, warning that ‚Äútoday's rhetoric against the Roma is alarmingly similar to that used by the Nazis before the mass killings started‚Äù. On 27 February 2012, he published a comprehensive report on the situation of Roma and travellers in Europe, stressing that in many European countries they are still denied basic human rights and suffer blatant racism. In a published letter to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel dating back to 2009, Hammarberg calls for a halt on deportations to Kosovo in particular, saying that those deported there are exposed to political persecution and are forced to live in camps. He repeated this ‚Äúurgent recommendation‚Äù one year later in a letter to the then German Federal Minister of the Interior, Thomas de Mazi√®re. A special committee organised by Hammarberg described a Roma camp in Kosovo as ‚Äúa humanitarian catastrophe‚Äù. The Human Rights Commissioner also heavily criticised France‚Äôs mass deportation of Roma in 2010. For his resilience and passion in the question of Roma rights, Thomas Hammarberg has been honoured by the Documentation and Cultural Centre and the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma and the Manfred Lautenschlaeger Foundation with the European Civil Rights Prize of the Sinti and Roma in Berlin on 3 April 2012. Publications Hammarberg has published widely on various human rights issues, and particularly on the rights of the child, refugee policy, minority issues, xenophobia, islamophobia, Roma rights, LGBT rights in Europe as well as international affairs and security. He is also well known for his presentations and lectures on human rights at various intergovernmental and academic institutions. As Commissioner he has published a series of \\"Viewpoint\\" articles on human rights issues in Europe on the institution's website. He regularly publishes comments focusing on main human rights issues. During his mandate as Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Hammarberg has visited and published reports about almost all of the Council of Europe 47 member states.

The three vertical aerofoil blades have a helical twist of 60 degrees, similar to Gorlov's water turbines . The turbine consists of three vertical symmetrical airfoil blades, each having a helical twist. The helical feature spreads the torque evenly over the entire revolution, thus preventing the destructive pulsations of the straight-bladed giromill (Darrieus turbine). The wind pushes each blade around on both the windward and leeward sides of the turbine. As with a Darrieus turbine, theoretically, there is no torque on a stationary turbine, due to symmetry of the turbine and of the blades. Starting is achieved by operating the generator as a motor. Torque is caused by a change in the apparent wind direction relative to the moving blades. Another advantage of the helical twist is that the blades generate torque well from upward-slanting airflow. This is negligible in open country, but tall buildings and cliff faces generate a bow wave which directs airflow up and over them. Turbines mounted on high building rooftops or clifftops are exposed to significantly slanting flow, and the Turby can extract more useful energy from it than a propeller-type turbine can because horizontal axis (HAWT) types cannot change their pitch to face the wind directly. The turbine measures 2.0 m (6'7\\") in diameter by 2.9 m (9'6\\") high (including generator), and weighs 136 kg (300 lb). It is specified to generate power in winds of between 4 m/s (9 mph, 7.8kts) and 14 m/s (31 mph, 27.2kts), and can survive winds of 55 m/s (123 mph, 107kts). The rated power at 14 m/s is 2.5 kW (3.35 hp). The AC output from the synchronous generator is rectified to DC, then inverted to AC at 230 V 50 Hz. Core International developed the turbine in the Netherlands with research input from the Delft University of Technology.

Owned by iHeartMedia, it broadcasts an adult album alternative (AAA) format. Its studios are located alongside its sister stations in southeast Denver, while its transmitter is located southwest of Eldorado Springs. KBCO can also be heard via translator station 94.3 K232AC located west of Denver in Breckenridge, Summit County on Baldy Mountain. History In 1955, the station first signed on as KRNW.Broadcasting Yearbook 1957 page 70 It was owned by Robert Wilkenson and was powered at only 2,000 watts, a fraction of its current output. The studios were located at 1305 Spruce Street in downtown Boulder. The current format on the station was derived in part from another Boulder station, KADE 1190 AM (now KVCU). KADE was a solar-powered daytimer station, which signed on and off the air in conjunction with the rising and setting of the sun. KADE was purchased in 1975 by Bob Greenlee. Two years later Greenlee also purchased KRNW, which then became KBCO-FM. The original studio was located in an office complex at 1900 Folsom Street in Boulder. The station's original transmitter was located on a tower atop Lee Hill. Bob Greenlee worked with consulting engineers and petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to boost KBCO's power. The original format was co- designed by Dennis Constantine and Randy Morrison (formerly of KBPI Denver and WLS-FM/WDAI Chicago; he had also designed the format for KADE). At launch the airstaff included Dennis Constantine, the station's original program director, in the mornings; Bob Lynch overnight, Music Director Judy McNutt and production director Richard Ray. Jon Steele hosted 6-10 in the evenings. The freedom allowed to the DJs in the early days sparked a high level of creativity. The station produced an award-winning series of yearly broadcasts, collectively known as \\"Intervention Day: Planet Earth's Premier Holiday.\\" Intervention Day broadcasts were set in the future and celebrated the day the Inter-Galactic Community intervened to prevent Earth's leaders from destroying the planet. Celebrations were marked by music from the time prior intervention day. The broadcasts won the 1987 International Radio Festival of New York \\"Grand Award for Best Entertainment Program of the Year\\". Worldwide competition included ABC, National Public Radio, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the BBC. In 1982, KBCO was the first station in Colorado to play music from CDs. In a partnership with local audio retailer Listen Up, CDs and playback equipment were shipped in from Japan. Greenlee moved KADE and KBCO to a state of the art studio complex at 4801 Riverbend Road in East Boulder and then sold the stations to Noble Broadcasting in 1987. During this time of KBCO's history, deejays selected the songs to play on their own shows from a broad music library. In 1988, KBCO Studio C was created by Production Director Tom Koetting with a performance by Melissa Etheridge in a small cramped production studio. The studio has since been upgraded, and many artists in Colorado for a concert tour or promotion tour stop by to play live on the radio. The station releases a CD every year in late November with the best or most memorable Studio C performances. The CDs, titled KBCO Studio C followed by the volume number, sell out quickly and all proceeds from the album are donated to the Boulder County AIDS Project and Food Bank of the Rockies. Two retrospective CDs have been released combining the best of the previous CDs and several unreleased songs. KBCO has occasionally been rated #1 in the Denver-Boulder Arbitron ratings with overall listeners 12+, the first time in 1988. KBCO is often rated #1 with its target audience 25 to 54-year- olds. In 1996, the station was sold to Jacor Communications (a forerunner of current owner iHeartMedia).Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1998 page D-69 The sale resulted in a tightening of the format. KBCO DJs no longer have control over what they play except during special features. The playlist is chosen by the station's programming staff. In 2010, KBCO moved from its longtime home on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder to the Clear Channel studios in the Denver Tech Center shared with stations KOA, KBPI, KRFX, KPTT and KTCL.https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2010/01/11/daily77.html KBCO carries the noncommercial show Etown every Sunday. The show, hosted by Nick and Helen Forster, originates from Boulder and features live performances and an emphasis on environmental issues. Current DJs include Bret Saunders, Ginger, Keefer, Robbyn Hart, Scott Arbough and Frank Bell.https://kbco.iheart.com/ HD radio In 2005, KBCO received an experimental permit from the FCC and became the first FM radio station in the state of Colorado to implement \\"Multicasting.\\" It airs two subchannels using the Ibquity Digital HD system. The station debuted an HD2 sub-channel playing only songs recorded in KBCO's \\"Studio C.\\" The Studio C Channel is also available on KBCO's web site, along with the New Music Channel, an Internet channel playing all new releases.http://www.hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=22 HD Radio Guide for Denver KBCO's HD3 subchannel carried the news/talk programming of co-owned AM 850 KOA, with two translator stations fed by it: 94.1 K231AA in Boulder and 94.1 K231BQ in Golden.

He founded the aikido style Manseikan Aikido. Biography He was born kobuke Kagoshima Prefecture on the island of Kikaiga-shima (or Kikaijima), Japan and in his teens became an uchideshi of Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of aikido. His live-in apprenticeship under the founder took place during World War II, and he also spent a brief period at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo after the war. On October 23, 1953 he gave the first public demonstration of aikido in Ky≈´sh≈´. The following January he opened up the Manseikan dojo (‰∏áÁîüÈ§®) on the premises of the Tettori Shrine (ÊâãÂèñÁ•ûÁ§æÔºâ in the heart of Kumamoto City. His aikido spread throughout Ky≈´sh≈´ to cities such as Fukuoka, Kagoshima, Nagasaki, and Miyazaki. During this time, the number of practitioners rose to over 20,000 with over 3,000 people reaching the level of black belt. In 1961, at the age of 38, Sunadomari received the rank of 9th [dan]. Sunadomari dedicated himself to the teaching of aikido in Ky≈´sh≈´ while based in Kumamoto. Sunadomari comes from a family of devout believers in ≈åmoto, the religion on which Ueshiba based the spiritual underpinnings of aikido, and the Sunadomari family maintained a close relationship with the founder until his death. Kanemoto Sunadomari (elder brother of Kanshu) studied under the founder in the early 1930s and published the first biography of the Founder in 1969 entitled Aikido Kaiso Morihei Ueshiba. A newer version of this book was later published under the title Bu no Shinjin. Fukiko (Mitsue) Sunadomari (elder sister of Kanshu) was a close personal confidante of the founder until his death and was also a high ranking practitioner of aikido. After Ueshiba's death in 1969, Sunadomari founded his own independent style in Kumamoto City and began his further study of the spirit of aikido. In 1999, he renamed his style Aiki Manseido (ÂêàÊ∞£‰∏áÁîüÈÅì) symbolizing his conviction to help spread world peace by transmitting the spirit of the founder across the world through physical technique. The \\"do\\" in Manseido is the same as in Aikido, referring to \\"the way\\", rather than the \\"kan\\" in Manseikan that can be translated as mansion or castle. Manseido translates as \\"the way of giving life to all things\\" or \\"the way for all people.\\" On January 11, 2008, Sunadomari chose to return to using the name Manseikan Aikido (‰∏áÁîüÈ§®ÂêàÊ∞£ÈÅì) to pay homage to the Founder and to re-emphasize his organization's dedication to the study and manifestation of the Founder's philosophy. Practitioners of his style recite the Spirit of Aikido (ÂêàÊ∞£ÈÅì„ÅÆÁ≤æÁ•û) before beginning each practice : \\"Aiki is Love... it is through the spirit of protective love for all things that we perfect our life's mission... \\". Practice in Manseikan Aikido consists of a set of flowing warm-up exercises (Ê∫ñÂÇôÈÅãÂãï), a number of paired movements that train both body movement (taisabaki, ‰ΩìË£Å„Åç) and breath-power(ÂëºÂê∏Âäõ), practice of basic technique (kihon waza, Âü∫Êú¨ÊäÄ), as well as paired warm-down exercises (sei no undo, ËÉå„ÅÆÈÅãÂãï). Training is further supplemented with practice using the wooden sword (bokken,Êú®Ââ£) and staff (j≈ç ,Êùñ). Sunadomari is known for his emphasis on kokyu ryoku (breath power; ÂëºÂê∏Âäõ) and his extremely soft and powerful technique. He is widely acclaimed for his dynamic performance in the First Friendship Demonstration which was held in Tokyo in 1985 and became one of the most famous modern aikido demonstrations captured on film. He has written several books, most of which have never been translated from their original Japanese. In 2004, his book Enlightenment through Aikido (Aikido de Satoru, ÂêàÊ∞óÈÅì„ÅßÊÇü„Çã) became the first to be released in English translation.

It was written under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene, and was first published in 1961. Plot summary Nancy Drew is called to New York City by her Aunt Eloise to solve a missing-person case. The granddaughter of her elderly Chinese author neighbor, Mr. Soong, has been kidnapped. The search is on, first by disguising Nancy's friend George Fayne as the missing Chi Che, and then pursuing a lead at Chi Che's place of employment, a book store, where Nancy encounters its suspicious owner, Mr Stromberg. Nancy decides to visit the store again but as she goes along the sidewalk, Nancy is knocked-out by a falling vase which hits her on the head. While Nancy is unconscious, Bess and George take up the mystery and a red-haired man is quickly arrested. A series of clues leads the girls to Hong Kong, where Nancy's boyfriend, Ned Nickerson, joins the action. Nancy foolishly follows \\"Chi Che\\" on board a plane, and is herself kidnapped. Ingenious Nancy uses her lipstick to signal for help on the plane windows. After her rescue, she follows more clues to an international smuggling ring, and, utilizing a disguised George once again, forces the thieves out of hiding and has the chance to finally locate the missing girl.

It was originally produced by Mark Goodson Productions, at the time also producing game shows for state lotteries alongside his regular game shows. After the first five shows, production was transferred to Jonathan Goodson Productions (long discussed as the first solo production for JGP), after All American Television (which acquired Mark Goodson's company a few weeks earlier) spun out their lottery game shows to Mark Goodson's son, Jonathan Goodson. Production would later transfer to Columbia TriStar Television and Game Show Network from 1997 to 1999. The program was taped at Universal Studios Florida near Orlando, Florida. The show's original announcer was Rich Fields. Rich was the announcer on Flamingo Fortune for three seasons and filled in as host on at least one occasion. The original hosts were JD Roberto and Heather Alexander, who were replaced after the first season by the team of Michael Young and Lisa Stahl-Sullivan. The \\"Flamingo Fortune\\" name was later used for a series of scratch-off games introduced by the lottery in 2013. Rules, 1st Format (1995‚Äì1997) Thirty contestants were in the contestant pool, all selected from those who sent in losing scratch-off lottery tickets. Alexander/Stahl would spin a wheel that was hooked to a randomizer. When the wheel stopped, the player selected would play a game, in addition to winning a set of lottery tickets. These rules were similar to Illinois Instant Riches. =Beach Ball= 12 sandcastles were placed on a rotating platform. An apparatus with the beach ball was nearby. The contestant would turn his/her back to the platform and pull a lever to release the beach ball. The ball would swing through the platform 6 times, knocking over the sandcastles. Each sandcastle remaining after one round was worth $1,000 - each one remaining after round two was worth an additional $2,000. The contestant could stop at this point or opt for one more round of six swings. Three sandcastles were placed on the platform, or if there were more than 3 still standing after round two, they were simply left alone. If at least three were left standing after this round, the contestant's winnings would be doubled. Otherwise, the contestant would lose half of his/her winnings. (If a contestant won, he/she was offered the chance again with eight swings with same rules as before.) Maximum payoff is $144,000. =Grand Prix= Contestants were shown a board with 3 racecars - red, yellow, and blue. They were then shown a board of 12 numbered boxes, and asked to call out numbers, one at a time. Finding three of a color ended up the game and awarded the contestant a cash prize -- $5,000 (for red), $25,000 (for yellow), or a cash prize of up to $100,000 (for blue). If blue reached the goal first, the contestant would choose from one of four letters (A, B, C, D), each of which hid a different cash amount (two each of $50,000 and $100,000). =Splashdown= The player faces a board of 18 numbered rods, split into three rows (1-4 on top, 5-10 in the middle, and 11-18 on the bottom), each holding up a colored ball. Rods 1-4 held up two red's and a green, the rest held yellow balls. The player draws a number, and that number's rod gets removed from the playfield. If a yellow ball splashes down into the water, the player wins $10,000. If no balls splash down, the player wins $1,000. The only way the game ends (besides the player saying \\"I'll stop\\") is if a red ball or a green ball splashes down. If the red ball splashes down, either by itself or with other colored balls - even the green one - the player loses half their winnings. If the green ball splashes down with no red ball, the player's total is bumped to $100,000. =Steeple Chase= In the first round, the player set six balls - four gold, two black - down a track of ramps. The balls could split up and collide until they reached the bottom of the track and crossed the finish line. If a black ball finished first, the player won $5,000; if a red ball finished first, the player got $10,000. For the second round, there were four gold and four black balls used. A black ball winning the race earned the player $5,000 more, while a gold ball won $25,000. After the third round, the player could either play the third round with three gold and four black balls, or with six gold and three black balls. The second set, however, would cost the player half his/her winnings at that point. A black ball coming in first added nothing, a gold ball finishing first added $50,000, but if the gold balls came in first, second, and third, the player won $100,000. =Freefall= The contestant pulls a lever that will launch a ping pong ball to the top of the board, through swinging paddles, through a series of pegs, and into one of eight slots at the bottom of the board. Landing in an empty slot was worth $5,000. Each empty slot accumulated an additional $5,000. If a ping pong ball landed in a slot that was already occupied, he/she would be issued a strike. After two strikes, the contestant could stop and take their winnings, or opt for another pull. If a ping pong ball landed in an empty slot, the contestant would have his/her money doubled, and would be offered another pull. If the contestant earned their third strike, they would lose half of their winnings. Play would continue until all eight slots are filled, a third strike is issued, or the contestant chose to stop. The theoretical maximum payoff is $640,000, but this would require that each of a contestant's first three balls land in the same slot, followed by each following ball landing in a new slot. The odds of this happening were approximately 1 in 213,044. This game originated from the Illinois Lottery game show Illinois Instant Riches, but under the name Double Dollars. It later adapted a game called Freefall with different rules. Treasure Island This is the final round, utilizing returning champions from previous weeks, and follows the rules of the \\"Pot O'Gold\\" game from Illinois Instant Riches. The \\"trapper\\" (returning champion) would stand at the end of a path behind a keypad with three buttons and a red button. The \\"trappee\\" (opponent) stood at the front of the path, with 8 spaces between the two. The first 5 steps were numbered 1-5; the last three had cash prizes. The opponent could take up to three steps at a time, but the champion was charged with predicting which step the opponent would pick (referred to as \\"locking in a booby-trap,\\" at which three blue lights would flash and a \\"typewriter\\" sound effect occurred). After the opponent took his/her position (at which the lights would turn off except the step chosen, accompanied by a G-note bell), the host would ask the champion to \\"spring the trap\\" (press the red button). If the opponent dodged the \\"trap\\", the game would continue. If not, the opponent had to return to their original position. Each step had a blue light that would turn to a flashing red (accompanied by an \\"explosion\\" sound effect) whenever the booby- trap was sprung. If the player avoided the trap, the blue light flashed (accompanied by a \\"harp\\" sound effect), and the red light would light up where the booby-trap was placed. Opponents won and took over the championship if they landed on one of the last three spaces on the path‚Äîthe first was worth $10,000, the second worth $25,000, and the last marked \\"Treasure Chest\\". If the opponent ended on this space, he/she could pick from a chest of coins worth from $50,000 to $500,000. The $500,000 was won at least once. If the champion successfully \\"trapped\\" the newcomer twice, the game ended with the champion winning an additional $25,000. Rules, 2nd Format (1997‚Äì1999) On October 11, 1997 (the date Sony assumed production), the format was revamped, adding new games, and giving players a chance to win up to $1,000,000 prior to playing the game. The contestant wheel was revamped; all thirty names were on the wheel, and increasing cash prizes were on the edge of the wheel. Stahl would spin the wheel, and one of the cash prizes would land on a name. Stahl would then throw balls into the center of the wheel; these balls would land in slots by each name. If one of those balls landed in a slot belonging to the name attached to the money, they would automatically win that money on the spot. The first game has values of $10K, $25K, and $50K. (In early episodes the values were $10K, $25K, and $100K.) The second doubles the top prize to $100,000 ($200,000 in early episodes). The third game increases the top prize to $1,000,000. The values for the first two games were selected at random prior to the show and during a commercial break. The $1,000,000 grand prize was won at least twice. Formats for most games were carried over to the California Lottery's Make Me a Millionaire. =Flamingo Diceway= Four contestants vied for a new car. They were given the first number of the car for free, then had to roll the next numbers by launching 6 numbered dice with using a catapult. If the next number landed face up when the dice settled, they were credited with that number. Rolling all four numbers won the car; a miss at any point ended the game for that player, and awarded them $500 for each correct number rolled (including the first number). =Break the Piggy Bank= Two players competed. The game offers two rounds, but only the first- round winner gets the option of continuing to the second round. In the first round, each player begins with $1,000 and gets up to five turns to add to it. The players alternate in choosing from a set of ten piggy banks. When chosen, a piggy bank is opened to reveal its contents and remove it from further play. Seven of the piggy banks have amounts ranging from $1,000 to $20,000. The other three have the word \\"Oink\\". Players accumulate values until one of the players has chosen two \\"Oink\\"'s. That player leaves with half of his or her accumulated amount, or $500 if they hit two \\"Oink\\"'s on their first two turns. The other player receives a $5,000 bonus and the option to leave with the accumulated winnings or go to the second round. In the second round, the player chooses one piggy bank out of five. Three of those piggy banks will halve the player's winnings, but the other two will either double or triple the winnings. =Florida's Famous= Florida's Famous is a one-player game with up to four rounds and cash prizes ranging from $4,000 to $160,000. In each round, the player picks a number from one to five, to reveal a statement about Florida. The player gains money only when the choice reveals a true statement. After each round, the player may leave with the accumulated winnings or continue to the next round. (The false statements tend to be absolutely ridiculous.) In the first round, the player wins $4,000 for each choice that reveals a true statement. The round begins with one play in which all five statements are true, ensuring a win. The game is reset with one false and four true statements, and the round continues until the player picks the false statement. At the end of the first round, the player's accumulated winnings may range from $4,000 to $20,000. For the remaining rounds, the payoff is either a doubling (for a true statement) or halving (for a false statement) of the winnings, with one play per round; a false statement also ends the game. Round 2 has one false statement; another false statement is added in each successive round, so that there are only two true statements in round 4. A player who wins round 4 will have doubled the first-round winnings three times, resulting in total accumulated winnings ranging from $32,000 to $160,000. =Florida's Jackpot= For the final game, the remaining 23 players each drew a playing card from a deck during the final commercial break. Stahl drew a card from a duplicate deck, and the player holding that card got to play the final game. The player faces a board of eight cards, each under a letter in the word \\"FLORIDA's\\". After selecting the first card, which is then turned over, then another card, the player must guess whether the next card is higher or lower than the previous one (like those on Card Sharks). Two wrong calls ends the game, but seven correct guesses wins a jackpot starting at $50,000 and increasing by $5,000 each week until it's won. The player won $2,000 for every correct guess if unsuccessful.

Originating as the former's sports division Deportes Telemundo from 1999 to 2015, it broadcasts an array of sports events, including the association football matches from various international football leagues and the Olympic Games, among others. In order to save money Telemundo Deportes outsources most of its employees from different countries with lower wages mostly Spanish speaking. History =Origins as Deportes Telemundo= Former logo as Deportes Telemundo, used from 2002 to 2015. The division was originally formed in 1987 as Deportes Telemundo, which at first exclusively served as the sports division of Telemundo, with the acquisition of rights to football matches to select teams from the Mexican Primera Divisi√≥n (now Liga MX). Following NBC's $2.7 billion purchase of Telemundo Communications Group on October 11, 2001, Deportes Telemundo began to gradually be integrated into NBC Sports, although it would maintain sports programming rights separate from the main NBC broadcast network and its sister cable channels. Under NBC (which ironically lost the rights to the league that year to ABC), on August 20, 2002, Telemundo signed a three-year agreement with the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Spanish language broadcast rights to 15 NBA and up to ten WNBA regular season games; Telemundo and the NBA did not renew the deal upon its expiration following the 2004‚Äì05 season. On August 12, 2009, the division's production responsibilities were extended to sister cable network mun2 (now NBC Universo), when it carried an English language broadcast of a World Cup qualifier between the United States and Mexico national teams, which was broadcast as part of a one-day free preview available to most cable and satellite providers though was presented by NBC Sports; and furthermore in January 2010, when mun2 began airing Liga MX games under the brand F√∫tbol Mexicano (most of which aired as English language simulcasts of Telemundo's F√∫tbol Estelar soccer telecasts). On October 28, 2012, NBC Sports also announced a three-year, $250 million deal to televise Premier League matches, giving Telemundo and mun2 the Spanish language rights (with the latter simulcasting games broadcast in English on NBCSN) beginning with the 2013‚Äì14 season, replacing ESPN and Fox Soccer as the league's U.S. broadcasters; prior to the arrangement, NBC had proposed Telemundo for use as a Spanish-language simulcast partner for select sporting events for years after the 2001 purchase. On July 23, 2013, NBC Sports announced that Telemundo and mun2 would broadcast both NASCAR's regional and national series in Spanish (to which Fox and NBC held English language rights, with NBC acquiring the rights to the series through a new rights deal with NASCAR), beginning with the 2015 NASCAR season. NASCAR subsequently accelerated the start of the deal, allowing mun2 to carry the Toyota Series, a season-opening Mexican championship race sanctioned by NASCAR, live from Phoenix International Raceway during the weekend of the Profit on CNBC 500 on February 28, 2014. On October 22, 2011, Deportes Telemundo acquired the Spanish language rights to broadcast the FIFA Men's and Women's World Cup for around $600 million, replacing Univision as the tournament's Spanish language broadcaster, which began carrying the World Cup tournaments in 1978 (Fox acquired the English language U.S. broadcast rights through a separate agreement). The deal, which began with the 2015 Women's World Cup and runs through 2026, includes rights to associated FIFA- sanctioned tournaments (including the Men's Under 20 and Under 17 World Cups, and the Men's Beach Soccer World Cup), which will be telecast on Telemundo and NBC Universo; the deal was extended on February 12, 2015, to include rights to the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Through NBC's rights agreement with the National Football League (NFL), mun2 carried a Spanish simulcast of a Thanksgiving matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers on November 27, 2014; on February 1, 2015, the rebranded NBC Universo served as the Spanish- language broadcaster of Super Bowl XLIX (which NBC held rights to broadcast that year). On January 13, 2015, NBCUniversal promoted Deportes Telemundo senior vice president of sports Eli Vel√°zquez to the newly created position of Executive Vice President, Sports within the company's Hispanic Enterprises and Content unit, following the departure of the sports division's executive vice president Jorge Hidalgo (whose position was eliminated as part of restructuring of the division). =Reorganization with NBC Sports= On May 16, 2015, during Telemundo's 2015‚Äì16 upfront presentation in New York City, it was announced that Deportes Telemundo would be replaced by a new division initially known as NBC Deportes; the new division was formed as a branch of the English-language NBC Sports division, and be responsible for sports content for Telemundo, NBC Universo and related digital platforms. While it retained all existing sports telecast rights and programs aired by both Telemundo and NBC Universo, the latter network also began to expand its sports coverage, primarily in preparation for the 2016 Summer Olympics and the start of the division's contract with FIFA‚Äîwhose first events included the 2015 U-20 World Cup and Women's World Cup. It was announced in August 2015 that the division would migrate its operations from Telemundo's headquarters in Hialeah, Florida, to NBC Sports Group's facility in Stamford, Connecticut, in a phased process that was expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2016. Around 70 employees, including production staff and on-air talent, were given a month to decide if they want to remain with NBC Deportes and relocate to Stamford, providing relocation packages to employees who opt to move and severance packages to employees who chose not to move and are unable to find other jobs within NBCUniversal Hispanic Enterprises and Content; most positions within NBC Deportes that were based in the Hialeah offices ‚Äì with the exception of NBCDeportes.com digital staff, some tech operators employed with the sports unit and production and on-air staff for the late-night magazine program Titulares y M√°s, which will remain at the Telemundo headquarters ‚Äì were eliminated in the move, necessitating the employee offers. Around 30 additional staffing positions were expected to be added alongside the existing employees upon the move to Stamford, while the division will invest heavily in the division's infrastructure and sets for its news and analysis programs. Programs throughout the years Telemundo Deportes holds the sports broadcast rights to several sporting events (with much of its programming available through agreements with association football leagues and organizations) for broadcast on Telemundo and Universo, and also produces sports news, magazine and analysis programs that mostly air on Telemundo. Telemundo used to produce Rumbo al Mundial with the Conmebol Qualifying Soccer games for the World Cup, this was huge with Spanish speaking audiences but was not repeated for the 2020 World Cup Qualifier in Quatar. It also produces several specials in conjunction with organizations to which NBC Sports maintains programming agreement such as the National Football League (NFL). =Current broadcast rights= Events which are held by NBC Sports for their English language channels are designated in Italics. ;American football: * NBC Sunday Night Football: (2014‚Äìpresent) ** Super Bowls: All years where NBC holds rights since 2014 (XLIX, LII, LVI) ;Association football: * Copa Am√©rica (2019, 2021, 2024, 2028 -present) * Premier League (2013‚Äìpresent) * F√∫tbol Estelar: Liga MX; used in years where Telemundo has broadcast rights to home matches of specific Liga MX teams (2020-present for Guadalajara home matches) * FIFA Club World Cup (2014‚Äìpresent) * FIFA Confederations Cup (2017) * FIFA U-17 World Cup (2015, 2017, 2019, and 2021) * FIFA U-20 World Cup (2015, 2017, 2019, and 2021) * FIFA Women's World Cup (2015, 2019, and 2023) * FIFA World Cup (2018, 2022, and 2026) ;Futsal: * FIFA Futsal World Cup (2016, 2020, 2024, and 2028) ;Olympic Games: * Juegos Olimpicos por Telemundo ** Summer Olympic Games (2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024, 2028, 2032) ;Other programming: * Boxeo Telemundo (1987‚Äìpresent) * Ritmo Deportivo (2002‚Äìpresent) * Rumbo Al Mundial (1987‚Äìpresent) * Titulares Telemundo (1999‚Äìpresent) * Titulares Y Mas (2008‚Äìpresent) =Former programs= ;American Football: *Thursday Night Football: (2016‚Äì2017) ;Basketball: * NBA en Telemundo (2003‚Äì2005) * WNBA en Telemundo (2003‚Äì2005) Notable personalities =Current= Play-by- play * Andr√©s Cantor * Alejandro L√≥pez * Carlos Yustis * Cop√°n Alvarez * F√©lix de Jes√∫s * Edgar Lopez * Omar Amador * Sammy Sadovnik * Erasmo Provenza Color commentators/Analysts * Carlos Contreras * Carlos Hermosillo * Manuel Sol * Tony N√∫√±ez * Ren√© Giraldo * Viviana Vila * Nicol√°s Mass√∫ * Jorge Koechlin von Stein * Frederik Oldenburg Reporters * Kaziro Aoyama * Miguel Gurwitz Studio hosts * Rosina Grosso * Ana Jurka * Karim Mendiburu * Leti Coo Studio analysts * Carlos Hermosillo * Tony N√∫√±ez * Ren√© Giraldo * Nicol√°s Mass√∫ * Jorge Koechlin von Stein * Frederik Oldenburg References External links Titulares Y M√°s * Titulares Telemundo * Ritmo Deportivo * F√∫tbol M√©xico * NBC Sports website Telemundo NBC Sports Sports television in the United States Soccer on United States television ","title":"Telemundo Deportes"},{"id":"2843766","text":"Dan Rutherford (born May 26, 1955) is an American politician who served as the 73rd Treasurer of Illinois from 2011 to 2015.

End of the Communist rule In 1989 Todor Zhivkov was removed from power after 35 years at the helm of the Communist Party. The reforms towards liberalization, both social, political and economic in the Eastern Bloc started with Mikhail Gorbachev's reform program in the Soviet Union which was felt in Bulgaria in the late 1980s. In fact, the release of tightening started with the end of the Stalinist era and continued slowly to the point that many previously forbidden literary texts were translated, the same was relevant for Hollywood movies, etc., stores appeared with Western products that had elements of advertisement (advertisement of products was generally unknown and not used in the Eastern Bloc since everything was accessible and the same to all), these new features of the late communist years acknowledged the gradual breaking of the Iron Curtain for the Comecon people. This, together with the policies of Gorbachev, led to more freedom and expectations for democracy among people. In November 1989, demonstrations on ecological issues were staged in Sofia, and these soon broadened into a general campaign for political reform. That Communists generally did not break the demonstrations was a sign of a possible change that would come. In fact communist politicians reacted by eventually voting for the removal of Todor Zhivkov as a communist party and country head and replacing him with Petar Mladenov, but this gained them only a short respite in power. In February 1990 the Communist Party, forced by street protests gave up its claim on power and in June 1990 the first free elections since 1931 were held, won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (the new name of the Communist Party). In July 1991 a new Constitution was adopted, which regulates a representative elected President and a Prime Minister and Cabinet. Transition Zhelyu Zhelev was the first democratically elected president of the Republic of Bulgaria. He is considered the father of democracy or the head of the democratic changes. Philip Dimitrov was one of the first democratic leaders in the early 90s, serving from 1991 to 1992. Like the other post- socialist regimes in eastern Europe, Bulgaria found the transition to capitalism rather painful and not easy as expected. The anti-Communist Union of Democratic Forces (in Bulgarian: –°–î–°, SDS) took office between 1991 and 1992 to carry through the privatization of agricultural land, properties and industry issuing shares in government enterprises to all citizens, but these were accompanied by massive unemployment as industries were no longer tightened to the broken Comecon and failed in competition of the global market without the participation of Bulgaria to new regional or world trade organizations, at the same time Bulgaria's industry showed to be backward which was amendable but in the hurry of political changes neither government, nor people were ready for industrial modernization. In fact the disbandment of former State security that was tightened to the Communist party (Bulgarian: –î–°, DS) although brought relief to many Bulgarian people previously feared to speak or express other than communist views, at the same time boosted criminality never seen before in Bulgaria. The police were not ready to care about and chase the criminality which was before kept low with the fearful methods of DS. This led to mass stealing of capital, machinery, materials and even furniture from the industry and also institutions. Referring to industry this led to soon failing to work of many factories, etcetera Zhan Videnov (1995‚Äì1997) : Form more information on the cabinet, see Videnov Government. The Socialists (former Communists) presented their political visions as the defenders of the poor against the excesses of the free market. Reaction against economic reforms appeared because reforms left many unemployed (unemployment was almost not existing before in Bulgaria) and many towns literally was left to drop economically just in months, this allowed Zhan Videnov of the Bulgarian Socialist Party to win the 1994 parliamentary elections. Videnov was very young when he stepped in the PM post and his inability to show political strength and his incompetence was soon acknowledged by people surrounding him who took advantage of it for own purposes and personal enrichment. This incompetence and the misguided policies of the Socialist government in all exacerbated the economic conditions. The government was clearly unsupported by Western countries and thus Bulgarian foreign policy seriously suffered, and in 1996 the economy fell into hyperinflation and many banks went bankrupt. In the presidential elections of that year the SDS's Petar Stoyanov was elected. In 1997 the BSP government collapsed after a month of nationwide protests and government was appointed by the President Stoyanov which coped to calm the economic situation. Later the democratic party of SDS came to power. Ivan Kostov (1997‚Äì2001) Between 1997 and 2001, much of the success of the Ivan Kostov government was due to Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihaylova, who had huge approval and support in Bulgaria and abroad. Ivan Kostov came to power in May 1997 after months of popular discontent and hyperinflation. Petar Stoyanov was the second democratically elected president of Bulgaria. His reign is characterized by pro-Western orientation. The new Democratic government headed by Ivan Kostov enjoyed strong support and moved the Bulgarian economy ahead, but allegations of corruption and inability to cope with some of the serious problems in the country caused frustration. The electorate became to some extent dissatisfied with both parties ‚Äì BSP and SDS. At that point Stoyanov, who still held some good positions and had public approval, took part in presidential elections seeking a second mandate, but he scandalously failed with a blunder on TV and lost support, and the elections too. The newly elected president, former BSP leader Georgi Parvanov, was not very well known to the public although he was in politics since the early 1990s, and was well received for his wise political behavior. Although a BSP candidate, he was rather perceived as an independent figure and he also always stated to be president to all Bulgarians without any political reference. At that point with the already dissatisfaction with both BSP and SDS, people were looking for new alternatives and new politicians. The return of Simeon II (2001‚Äì2005) : Form more information on the cabinet, see Sakskoburggotski Government. Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was the last king of Bulgaria, serving from 1943 to 1946. Half a century later, he served as prime minister from 2001 to 2005. In 2001, Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (Bulgarian: –°–∏–º–µ–æ–Ω –°–∞–∫—Å–∫–æ–±—É—Ä–≥–æ—Ç—Å–∫–∏, Simeon Sakskoburgotski), son of Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria, who had fled from socialist Bulgaria as a nine-year-old boy in 1946, became Prime Minister of Bulgaria. Several years prior to that, in 1996, he had visited Bulgaria with his family of two princes and a princess and it was then when he announced he would soon come back to his homeland to form a new political party. Several years later, Sakskoburggotski formed the National Movement Simeon II (NDSV) and swept away both major parties in the elections of June 2001 with a landslide victory. As Prime Minister, he followed a strong and strictly pro- western course, as a result of which Bulgaria joined NATO in 2004 and the European Union in 2007. Economic and political conditions visibly improved, although economic growth was not as high as expected and unemployment and emigration remained high. Problematic areas remained corruption, health care, organized crime (though scaled down), and higher education, which all need to be massively reformed. The Triple Coalition (2005‚Äì2009) : Form more information on the cabinet, see Stanishev Government. Georgi Parvanov is the third democratically elected president. While he personally does not hide his sympathies towards Russia and is regularly speaking for the need of development of Bulgarian and Russian energy projects, he also gave a serious support for the government of Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in its effort of joining in NATO and also made possible the three-coalition of Sergei Stanishev which accomplished the joining of Bulgaria to EU. Sergei Stanishev Prime Minister (2005-2009). His government is composed of BSP, NDSV and DPS. At the next parliamentary elections NDSV didn't reach enough votes to form alone a government, in fact BSP gained the largest share of the votes, followed by NDSV. And because none of the parties had enough seats in Parliament to establish a government on its own after more than a month of negotiations initiated by President Parvanov for the forming of coalition government that was needed for the EU joining, a coalition was formed between BSP, NDSV and MRF (Movement for Rights and Freedoms). Although divided by deep ideological and political differences, the three parties were united by a major goal: accomplishing the reforms necessary for joining the European Union in 2007. But ineffective administration and high-level corruption remained serious problems that was limiting the entrance of foreign businesses and entrepreneurs in the country. Additionally, Sergei Stanishev's government was caught in his last months by the world financial crisis but denied its existence and refused to initiate steps for protecting Bulgarian economy from it We are stable, ready for everything, there is no crisis // –°—Ç–∞–±–∏–ª–Ω–∏ —Å–º–µ, –≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∏ —Å–º–µ –∑–∞ –≤—Å–∏—á–∫–æ, –∫—Ä–∏–∑–∞ –Ω—è–º–∞, news.bg, 9 October 2008 for which he received wide disapproval.

Although remaining under Ottoman sovereignty, it functioned independently, taking Alexander of Battenberg as its first prince in 1879. In 1885 Alexander took control of the still-Ottoman Eastern Rumelia, officially under a personal union. Following Prince Alexander's abdication (1886), a Bulgarian Assembly elected Ferdinand I as prince in 1887. Full independence from Ottoman control was declared in 1908. In the 1912‚Äì1913 Balkan Wars, Bulgaria initially formed an alliance with Greece, Serbia and Montenegro against the Ottoman Empire, and together they liberated a great deal of Ottoman territory. Bulgaria, however, unhappy with the resulting division of territory, soon went to war against its former allies Serbia and Greece and lost territory it had gained in the first war. The First World War (1914‚Äì1918) saw Bulgaria fighting (1915‚Äì1918) alongside Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. Defeat led to the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine (27 November 1919), in accordance with which Bulgaria lost further territory. Social problems and political instability persisted throughout the interwar years. In the Second World War (1939‚Äì1945), Bulgaria again allied with Germany (March 1941). Although Sofia attempted to pull out of the war as the Soviet Union advanced towards its territory (1944), the Red Army invaded (September 1944), and a communist government came (1944‚Äì1946) to power and established the People's Republic of Bulgaria (1946‚Äì1990). 1878‚Äì1912 Borders of Bulgaria according to the Treaty of San Stefano of 3 March 1878 and the subsequent Treaty of Berlin The proposed Treaty of San Stefano of March 3, 1878 provided for a self-governing Bulgarian state, which comprised the geographical regions of Moesia, Thrace and Macedonia. Fearing the establishment of a large Russian client state on the Balkans, the other Great Powers, especially Britain and Austro-Hungary, were not willing to agree to the treaty.R. J. Compton, Bulgaria (Oxford University Press: Oxford, 2007) pp.93‚Äì94. The British were concerned over the safety of their routes to the Suez Canal and India.R. J. Compton, Bulgaria, p. 94. The Dual Monarchy that was the Austria-Hungarian Empire was afraid that establishment of a large independent Slavic state in the Balkans would encourage other Slavs living in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to also seek an independent break away state. Accordingly, both Britain and Austria-Hungary sought for the treaty to be revised.R. J.Compton, Bulgaria, p. 94. As a result, the Treaty of Berlin (1878), under the supervision of Otto von Bismarck of Germany and Benjamin Disraeli of Britain, revised the earlier treaty, and scaled back the proposed Bulgarian state. An autonomous Principality of Bulgaria was created, between the Danube and the Stara Planina range, with its seat at the old Bulgarian capital of Veliko Turnovo, and including Sofia. This state was to be under nominal Ottoman sovereignty but was to be ruled by a prince elected by a congress of Bulgarian notables meeting in Turnovo as the Bulgarian Principality's Constituent Assembly, on February 10, 1879R. J. Compton, Bulgaria, p. 96. and approved by the Powers. They insisted that the Prince could not be a Russian, but in a compromise Prince Alexander of Battenberg, a nephew of Tsar Alexander II, was chosen.R. J. Compton, Bulgaria, p. 101. An autonomous Ottoman province under the name of Eastern Rumelia was created south of the Stara Planina range, whereas Macedonia was returned under the sovereignty of the Sultan. =Personal Union with Eastern Rumelia= Balkan states around 1900.The Bulgarians adopted an advanced democratic constitution, and power soon passed to the Liberal Party led by Stefan Stambolov.R. J. Compton, Bulgaria, p. 102. Prince Alexander had conservative leanings, and at first opposed Stambolov's policies, but by 1885 he had become sufficiently sympathetic to his new country to change his mind, and supported the Liberals. He also supported the Unification of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia, which was brought about by a coup in Plovdiv in September 1885. The Powers did not intervene because of the power struggles between them. Shortly after, Serbia declared war on Bulgaria in the hope of grabbing territory while the Bulgarians were distracted. The Bulgarians defeated them at Slivnitsa and used the momentum to launch a counterattack. The Serbian army was pushed deeply into Serbian territory, but Bulgaria was forced to halt its advance after the Austro-Hungarian Empire threatened to intervene on the Serbian side. The unification was accepted by the Powers in the form of personal union. =Ferdinand= Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria These events made Alexander very popular in Bulgaria, but Russia was increasingly dissatisfied with his liberal tendencies. In August 1886 they fomented a coup, in the course of which Alexander was forced to abdicate and was exiled to Russia. Stambolov, however, acted quickly and the participants in the coup were forced to flee the country. Stambolov tried to reinstate Alexander, but strong Russian opposition forced the prince to abdicate again.R. J. Compton, Bulgaria p. 128. In July 1887 the Bulgarians elected Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha as their new Prince. Ferdinand was the \\"Austrian candidate\\" and the Russians refused to recognize him despite his friendship with Tsar Alexander III.R. J. Compton, Bulgaria, p. 132. Ferdinand initially worked with Stambolov, but by 1894 their relationship worsened. Stambolov resigned and was assassinated in July 1895. Ferdinand then decided to restore relations with Russia, which meant returning to a conservative policy. There was a substantial Bulgarian population still living under Ottoman rule, particularly in Macedonia. To complicate matters, Serbia and Greece too made claims over parts of Macedonia. Thus began the Balkan Wars, a five-sided struggle for control of these areas which lasted through World War I (Bulgaria during World War I). In 1903 there was a Bulgarian insurrection in Ottoman Macedonia and war seemed likely. In 1908 Ferdinand used the struggles between the Great Powers to declare Bulgaria a fully independent kingdom, with himself as Tsar, which he did on 5 October (though celebrated on 22 September, as Bulgaria remained officially on the Julian Calendar until 1916) in the St Forty Martyrs Church in Veliko Tarnovo. =Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising= The main external political problem confronting Bulgaria throughout the period up to World War I was the fate of Macedonia and Eastern Thrace. At the end of 19th century the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization was founded and began the preparation of an armed uprising in the regions still occupied by the Ottoman Turks. Relying in part on nationwide support on the part of the Principality of Bulgaria, IMARO got down to organizing a network of committees in Macedonia and Thrace. In August 1903 a mass armed uprising, known in history as the Ilinden-Preobrajenie, broke out in Macedonia and Thrace. Its aim was to liberate those regions, or at least to draw the attention of the Great Powers and make them advocate for the improvement of the living conditions for the population through legal and economic reforms. After three months of fierce battles the Ottoman army crushed the uprising using much cruelty against the civilian population. The Balkan Wars In 1911 the Nationalist Prime Minister, Ivan Evstratiev Geshov, set about forming an alliance with Greece and Serbia, and the three allies agreed to put aside their rivalries to plan a joint attack on the Ottomans. In February 1912 a secret treaty was signed between Bulgaria and Serbia, and in May 1912 a similar treaty was signed with Greece. Montenegro was also brought into the pact. The treaties provided for the partition of Macedonia and Thrace between the allies, although the lines of partition were left dangerously vague. After the Ottomans refused to implement reforms in the disputed areas, the First Balkan War broke out in October 1912. (See Balkan Wars for details.) Bulgarian dead in the Balkan Wars The allies had an astonishing success. The Bulgarian army inflicted several defeats on the Ottoman forces and advanced threateningly against Istanbul, while the Serbs and the Greeks took control of Macedonia. The Ottomans sued for peace in December. Negotiations broke down, and fighting resumed in February 1913. The Ottomans lost Adrianople to a combined Bulgarian-Serbian task force. A second armistice followed in March, with the Ottomans losing all their European possessions west of the Midia-Enos line, not far from Istanbul. Bulgaria gained possession of most of Thrace, including Adrianople and the Aegean port of Dedeagach (today Alexandroupoli). Bulgaria also gained a slice of Macedonia, north and east of Thessaloniki (which went to Greece), but only some small areas along her western borders. Boundaries on the Balkans after the First and the Second Balkan War (1912‚Äì1913) Bulgaria sustained the heaviest casualties of any of the allies, and on this basis felt entitled to the largest share of the spoils. The Serbs in particular did not see things this way, and refused to vacate any of the territory they had seized in northern Macedonia (that is, the territory roughly corresponding to the modern North Macedonia), stating that the Bulgarian army had failed to accomplish its pre-war goals at Adrianople (i. e., failing to capture it without Serbian help) and that the pre-war agreements on the division of Macedonia had to be revised. Some circles in Bulgaria inclined toward going to war with Serbia and Greece on this issue. In June 1913 Serbia and Greece formed a new alliance, against Bulgaria. The Serbian Prime Minister, Nikola Pasic, told Greece it could have Thrace if Greece helped Serbia keep Bulgaria out of Serbian part of Macedonia, and the Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos agreed. Seeing this as a violation of the pre-war agreements, and discreetly encouraged by Germany and Austria-Hungary, Tsar Ferdinand declared war on Serbia and Greece and the Bulgarian army attacked on June 29. The Serbian and the Greek forces were initially on the retreat on the western border, but they soon took the upper hand and forced Bulgaria into retreat. The fighting was very harsh, with many casualties, especially during the key Battle of Bregalnitsa. Soon Romania entered the war and attacked Bulgaria from the north. The Ottoman Empire also attacked from the south-east. The war was now definitely lost for Bulgaria, which had to abandon most of her claims of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, while the revived Ottomans retook Adrianople. Romania took possession of southern Dobruja. War and social conflict = World War I = In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars Bulgarian opinion turned against Russia and the western powers, whom the Bulgarians felt had done nothing to help them. The government of Vasil Radoslavov aligned Bulgaria with Germany and Austria- Hungary, even though this meant also becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria's traditional enemy. But Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of Britain and France) were all in possession of lands perceived in Bulgaria as Bulgarian. Bulgaria was content to sit on the fence and observe the fortunes of war before deciding whether to declare their sympathies. Bulgaria, recuperating from the Balkan Wars, sat out the first year of World War I, but when Germany promised to restore the boundaries of the Treaty of San Stefano, Bulgaria, which had the largest army in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October 1915. Britain, France and Italy then declared war on Bulgaria. Although Bulgaria, in alliance with Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottomans, won military victories against Serbia and Romania, occupying much of Macedonia (taking Skopje in October), advancing into Greek Macedonia, and taking Dobruja from the Romanians in September 1916, the war soon became unpopular with the majority of Bulgarian people, who suffered great economic hardship and also disliked fighting their fellow Orthodox Christians in alliance with the Muslim Ottomans. The Agrarian Party leader, Aleksandar Stamboliyski, was imprisoned for his opposition to the war. The Russian Revolution of February 1917 had a great effect in Bulgaria, spreading antiwar and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities. Membership in socialist parties in Bulgaria boomed. However, the socialists in Bulgaria were badly split ideologically. One group sought to work with other political parties representing other classes in order to be effective in bringing change to Bulgaria. Because of their \\"broad outlook\\" this group of socialists was known as the \\"broads.\\" The second group of socialists in Bulgaria were purists and refused to work with parties of different classes. They were called the \\"narrows.\\" Eventually, the broads formed themselves into the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party and the narrows became the Bulgarian Communist Party. In June, 1919, Radoslavov's government resigned. Mutinies broke out in the army, Stamboliyski was released from prisonR. J. Compton, Bulgaria, p. 218. and a republic was proclaimed. =The interwar years= In September 1918 the Serbs, British, French and Greeks broke through on the Macedonian front and Tsar Ferdinand was forced to sue for peace. Stamboliyski favoured democratic reforms, not a revolution. Alexander Stamboliyski made his first appearance on the Bulgarian political scene in 1903 as member of the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (BANU). In 1902 two agrarian newspapers were merged to form Zemedelsko Zname (Agrarian Banner) which became the voice of BANU. In 1906 Stamboliyski became the Editor of Zemedelsko Zname The poor harvest and hard times of 1907 brought BANU to the fore again.R. J. Compton, Bulgaria, p. 183. In the 1908 elections BANU received 11.2% of the vote and obtained 23 seats in Bulgaria's unicameral parliament. In the August 1919 elections, BANU received 31.02% of the vote.R. J. Compton, Bulgaria, p. 221. In order to head off the revolutionaries, Stamboliyski persuaded Ferdinand to abdicate in favour of his son Boris III. The revolutionaries were suppressed and the army disbanded. Under the Treaty of Neuilly (November 1919), Bulgaria lost its Aegean coastline to Greece and nearly all of its Macedonian territory to the new state of Yugoslavia, and had to give Dobruja back to the Romanians (see also Dobruja, Western Outlands, Western Thrace). Elections in March 1920 gave the Agrarians a large majority, and Stamboliyski formed Bulgaria's first genuinely democratic government. Stamboliyski faced huge social problems in what was still a poor country inhabited mostly by peasant smallholders. Bulgaria was saddled with huge war reparations to Yugoslavia and Romania, and had to deal with the problem of refugees as pro-Bulgarian Macedonians had to leave the Yugoslav Macedonia. Nevertheless, Stamboliyski was able to carry through many social reforms, although opposition from the Tsar, the landlords and the officers of the much-reduced but still influential army was powerful. Another bitter enemy was the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO), which favoured a war to regain Macedonia for Bulgaria. Faced with this array of enemies, Stamboliyski allied himself with the Bulgarian Communist Party and opened relations with the Soviet Union. In March 1923 Stamboliyski signed an agreement with Yugoslavia recognising the new border and agreeing to suppress VMRO. This triggered a nationalist reaction, and on 9 June there was a coup after which Stamboliykski was assassinated (beheaded). A right wing government under Aleksandar Tsankov took power, backed by the Tsar, the army and the VMRO, who waged a White terror against the Agrarians and the Communists. The Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov fled to the Soviet Union. There was savage repression in 1925 following the second of two failed attempts on the Tsar's life in the bomb attack on Sofia Cathedral (the first attempt took place in the mountain pass of Arabakonak). But in 1926 the Tsar persuaded Tsankov to resign and a more moderate government under Andrey Lyapchev took office. An amnesty was proclaimed, although the Communists remained banned. The Agrarians reorganised and won elections in 1931 under the leadership of Nikola Mushanov. Just when political stability had been restored, the full effects of the Great Depression hit Bulgaria, and social tensions rose again. In May 1934 there was another coup, the Agrarians were again suppressed, and an authoritarian regime headed by Kimon Georgiev established with the backing of Tsar Boris. In April 1935 Boris took power himself, ruling through puppet Prime Ministers Georgi Kyoseivanov (1935‚Äì1940) and Bogdan Filov (1940‚Äì1943). The Tsar's regime banned all opposition parties and took Bulgaria into alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Although the signing of the Balkan Pact of 1938 restored good relations with Yugoslavia and Greece, the territorial issue continued to simmer. World War II and after Under Filov's government Bulgaria drifted into World War II, faced by an Invasion and bribed by the return of southern Dobruja from Romania, on the orders of Hitler (see Second Vienna Award), in September 1940. In March 1941 Bulgaria formally signed the Tripartite Pact, becoming a German ally, and German troops entered the country in preparation for the German invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia. When Yugoslavia and Greece were defeated, Bulgaria was allowed to occupy all of Greek Thrace and most of Macedonia. Bulgaria declared war on Britain and the United States, but resisted German pressure to declare war on the Soviet Union, fearful of pro- Russian sentiment in the country. In August 1943 Tsar Boris died suddenly after returning from Germany (possibly assassinated, although this has never been proved) and was succeeded by his six-year-old son Simeon II. Power was held by a council of regents headed by the young Tsar's uncle, Prince Kirill. The new Prime Minister, Dobri Bozhilov, was in most respects a German puppet. Resistance to the Germans and the Bulgarian regime was widespread by 1943, co- ordinated mainly by the Communists. Together with the Agrarians, now led by Nikola Petkov, the Social Democrats and even with many army officers they founded the Fatherland Front. Partisans operated in the mountainous west and south. By 1944 it was obvious that Germany was losing the war and the regime began to look for a way out. Bozhilov resigned in May, and his successor Ivan Ivanov Bagryanov tried to arrange negotiations with the western Allies. Meanwhile, the capital Sofia was bombed by Allied aircraft in late 1943 and early 1944, with raids on other major cities following later. =The communist coup= But it was the Soviet army which was rapidly advancing towards Bulgaria. In August 1944, Bulgaria unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the war and asked the German troops to leave: Bulgarian troops were hastily withdrawn from Greece and Yugoslavia. In September the Soviets crossed the northern border. The government, in a desperate attempt at avoiding a Soviet occupation, declared war on Germany, but the Soviets could not be put off, and on September 8 they declared war on Bulgaria ‚Äì which thus found itself for a few days at war with both Germany and the Soviet Union. On September 16, the Soviet army entered Sofia. The Fatherland Front took office in Sofia following a coup d'√©tat, setting up a broad coalition under the former ruler Kimon Georgiev and including the Social Democrats and the Agrarians. Under the terms of the peace settlement, Bulgaria was allowed to keep Southern Dobruja, but formally renounced all claims to Greek and Yugoslav territory. To prevent further disputes 150,000 Bulgarians were expelled from Greek Thrace. The Communists deliberately took a minor role in the new government at first, but the Soviet representatives were the real power in the country. A Communist- controlled People's Militia was set up, which harassed and intimidated non- Communist parties. In February 1945 the new realities of power in Bulgaria were shown when Prince Kirill and hundreds of other officials of the old regime were arrested on charges of war crimes. By June Kirill and the other regents, 22 former ministers and many others had been executed. In September 1946 the monarchy was abolished by plebiscite, and young Tsar Simeon was sent into exile. The Communists now openly took power, with Vasil Kolarov becoming President and Dimitrov becoming Prime Minister. Free elections promised for 1946 were boycotted by the opposition, and in November, 1945 the Fatherland Front won in a single-party election. The Agrarians refused to co-operate with the new regime, and in June 1947 their leader Nikola Petkov was arrested. Despite strong international protests he was executed in September. This marked the final establishment of a Communist regime in Bulgaria. =The Holocaust= Despite a series of anti-Jewish legislation starting in 1940 (e.g. Jews were excluded from public service, banned from certain areas, restricted economically, and not allowed to intermarry; see The Law for Protection of the Nation), Bulgaria was the only country besides Albania, Denmark and Finland to successfully resist the deportation of its Jewish population. Plans were made to deport Jews in 1943, and 20,000 were expelled from Sofia, but protests (initiated by Dimitar Peshev) from political and clerical leaders stopped further cooperation, saving all of the 50,000 Jews in the country.ADL HONORS BULGARIA FOR SAVING JEWS FROM HOLOCAUST However, in March 1943 almost 12,000 Jews in Thrace and Macedonia, both of which were administered by the Bulgarian government on behalf of the Nazis, were deported to Auschwitz and Treblinka, where they were murdered..

Social history =Agrarianism= Bulgaria emerged from Turkish rule as a poor, underdeveloped agricultural country, with little industry or natural resources. Most of the land was owned by small farmers, with peasants comprising 80% of the population of 3.8 million in 1900. The few Turkish nobles left and large land holdings were uncommon, but there were many poor peasants living on the margins. Agrarianism was the dominant political philosophy in the countryside, as the peasantry organized a movement independent of any existing party. In 1899, the Bulgarian Agrarian Union was formed, bringing together rural intellectuals such as teachers with ambitious peasants. It promoted modern farming practices, as well as elementary education.John Bell, \\"The Genesis of Agrarianism in Bulgaria,\\" Balkan Studies, 1975, Vol. 16 Issue 2, pp 73‚Äì92 =Education= The government promoted modernization, with special emphasis on building a network of elementary and secondary schools. By 1910, there were 4,800 elementary schools, 330 lyceums, 27 high schools, and 113 vocational schools. From 1878 to 1933 France funded numerous libraries, research institutes, and Catholic schools throughout Bulgaria. The main aims were to disseminate French culture and the French language and to gain prestige and business for France. Indeed, French became the primary foreign language in Bulgaria and the wealthy typically sent their children to elite Roman Catholic French language schools taught by Frenchmen. The prosperous Greek community of southern Bulgaria set up their own network of Greek language primary and secondary schools that promoted Hellenism in order to counter the threat of assimilation into Bulgarian society. In 1888, a university was established. It was renamed the University of Sofia in 1904, where the three faculties of history and philology, physics and mathematics, and law produced civil servants for national and local government offices. It became the center of German and Russian intellectual, philosophical and theological influences.Nedyalka Videva, and Stilian Yotov, \\"European Moral Values and their Reception in Bulgarian Education,\\" Studies in East European Thought, March 2001, Vol. 53 Issue 1/2, pp 119‚Äì128 =Turks= While most Turkish officials, landowners, businessmen and professionals left after 1878, some Turkish peasant villages persisted, comprising perhaps as much as 10% of Bulgaria's population. They were largely self-governing, continued their traditional religion and language, and were tolerated by the Bulgarian government until the 1970s. They were protected as a minority group under international law by various treaties and agreements, including the Treaty of Berlin (1878). For over a century, this protection enabled Bulgaria's Turks to develop separate religious and cultural organizations, schools, a local Turkish press, and a literature. After 1970 the Communist government impose a program of cultural assimilation, whereby Turkish was no longer a tolerated language, Turkish instruction in schools was stopped, and it was not allowed to speak Turkish in public.Bil√¢l Simsir, \\"The Turkish Minority in Bulgaria: History and Culture,\\" International Journal of Turkish Studies, Jan 1989, Vol. 4 Issue 2, pp 159‚Äì178R. J. Crampton, \\"The Turks in Bulgaria, 1878‚Äì1944,\\" International Journal of Turkish Studies, Jan 1989, Vol. 4 Issue 2, pp 43‚Äì78 =Urbanization= The first decade of the century saw sustained prosperity, with steady urban growth. The capital of Sofia grew by a factor of 600% from 20,000 population in 1878 to 120,000 in 1912, primarily from peasants who arrived from the villages to become labourers tradesmen and office seekers. Refugees from Turkish Macedonia also arrived, while there was relatively little emigration. Ethnic diversity characterized Bulgaria, with an Orthodox Bulgarian base, and numerous enclaves of Turks, Greeks and others. Bulgarian revolutionaries from the Macedonian area (then under Ottoman rule) used Bulgaria as a base, beginning in 1894, to agitate for a formal independence from the Ottoman Empire in order to later more easily reunite Macedonia and Bulgaria. They launched a poorly planned uprising in 1903 that was brutally suppressed, and led to tens of thousands of additional refugees pouring into Bulgaria.Pundeff, 1992 pp 65‚Äì70 See also * September Uprising References Bibliography * . 19th century in Bulgaria Kingdom of Bulgaria ","title":"History of Bulgaria (1878‚Äì1946)"},{"id":"2843773","text":"The Second Bulgarian Empire (, Vtor–æ BƒÉlgarsk–æ Tsarstvo) was a medieval Bulgarian state that existed between 1185 and 1396.John Van Antwerp Fine, The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest, University of Michigan Press, 1994, , p. 425. A successor to the First Bulgarian Empire, it reached the peak of its power under Tsars Kaloyan and Ivan Asen II before gradually being conquered by the Ottomans in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. It was succeeded by the Principality and later Kingdom of Bulgaria in 1878. Until 1256, the Second Bulgarian Empire was the dominant power in the Balkans, defeating the Byzantine Empire in several major battles. In 1205 Emperor Kaloyan defeated the newly established Latin Empire in the Battle of Adrianople. His nephew Ivan Asen II defeated the Despotate of Epiros and made Bulgaria a regional power again. During his reign, Bulgaria spread from the Adriatic to the Black Sea and the economy flourished. In the late 13th century, however, the Empire declined under constant invasions by Mongols, Byzantines, Hungarians, and Serbs, as well as internal unrest and revolts. The 14th century saw a temporary recovery and stability, but also the peak of Balkan feudalism as central authorities gradually lost power in many regions. Bulgaria was divided into three parts on the eve of the Ottoman invasion. Despite strong Byzantine influence, Bulgarian artists and architects created their own distinctive style. In the 14th century, during the period known as the Second Golden Age of Bulgarian culture, literature, art and architecture flourished. The capital city Tarnovo, which was considered a \\"New Constantinople\\", became the country's main cultural hub and the centre of the Eastern Orthodox world for contemporary Bulgarians.Obolensky, p. 246 After the Ottoman conquest, many Bulgarian clerics and scholars emigrated to Serbia, Wallachia, Moldavia, and Russian principalities, where they introduced Bulgarian culture, books, and hesychastic ideas. Nomenclature The name most frequently used for the empire by contemporaries was Bulgaria, as the state called itself. During Kaloyan's reign, the state was sometimes known as being of both Bulgarians and Vlachs. Pope Innocent III and other foreigners such as the Latin Emperor Henry mentioned the state as Bulgaria and the Bulgarian Empire in official letters.\\"Letters by the Latin Emperor Henry\\" in LIBI, vol. IV, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 15\\"Letters by the Latin Emperor Henry\\" in LIBI, vol. IV, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 16 In modern historiography, the state is called the Second Bulgarian Empire, Second Bulgarian Tsardom, or the Second Bulgarian Kingdom to distinguish it from the First Bulgarian Empire. An alternative name used in connection with the pre-mid 13th century period is the Empire of Vlachs and Bulgars; variant names include the Vlach‚ÄìBulgarian Empire, the Bulgarian‚ÄìWallachian Empire, or the Romanian‚ÄìBulgarian Empire; the latter name was used exclusively in Romanian historiography. However, Arabic chronicles from the 13th century had used only the name of Wallachia instead of Bulgaria and gave the Arabic coordinates of Wallachia and specified that Walachia was named \\"al-Awalak\\" and the dwellers \\"ulaqut\\" or \\"ulagh\\"Dimitri Korobeinikov, A broken mirror: the Kipchak world in the 13th century. In the volume: The other Europe from the Middle Ages, Edited by Florin Curta, Brill 2008, p. 394 Background In 1018, when the Byzantine emperor Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025) conquered the First Bulgarian Empire, he ruled it cautiously. The existing tax system, laws, and the power of low-ranking nobility remained unchanged until his death in 1025. The autocephalous Bulgarian Patriarchate was subordinated to the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople and downgraded to an archbishopric centred in Ohrid, while retaining its autonomy and dioceses. Basil appointed the Bulgarian John I Debranin as its first archbishop, but his successors were Byzantines. The Bulgarian aristocracy and tsar's relatives were given various Byzantine titles and transferred to the Asian parts of the Empire. Despite hardships, the Bulgarian language, literature, and culture survived; surviving period texts refer to and idealize the Bulgarian Empire. Most of the newly conquered territories were included in the themes Bulgaria, Sirmium, and Paristrion. As the Byzantine Empire declined under Basil's successors, invasions of Pechenegs and rising taxes contributed to increasing discontent, which resulted in several major uprisings in 1040‚Äì41, the 1070s, and the 1080s. The initial centre of the resistance was the theme of Bulgaria, in what is now Macedonia, where the massive Uprising of Peter Delyan (1040‚Äì41) and the Uprising of Georgi Voiteh (1072) took place. Both were quelled with great difficulty by Byzantine authorities. These were followed by rebellions in Paristrion and Thrace. During the Comnenian Restoration and the temporary stabilisation of the Byzantine Empire in the first half of the 12th century, the Bulgarians were pacified and no major rebellions took place until later in the century. History =Liberation= Church of St Demetrius in Tarnovo, built by Asen and Peter in the beginning of the uprising The disastrous rule of the last Comnenian emperor Andronikos I (r. 1183‚Äì85) worsened the situation of the Bulgarian peasantry and nobility. The first act of his successor Isaac II Angelos was to impose an extra tax to finance his wedding. In 1185, two aristocrat brothers from Tarnovo, Theodore and Asen, asked the emperor to enlist them into the army and grant them land, but Isaac II declined and slapped Asen across the face. Upon their return to Tarnovo, the brothers commissioned the construction of a church dedicated to Saint Demetrius of Salonica. They showed the populace a celebrated icon of the saint, whom they claimed had left Salonica to support the Bulgarian cause and called for a rebellion. That act had the desired effect on the religious population, who enthusiastically engaged in a rebellion against the Byzantines. Theodore, the elder brother, was crowned Emperor of Bulgaria under the name Peter IV, after the sainted Peter I (r.927‚Äì969). Almost all of Bulgaria to the north of the Balkan Mountains‚Äîthe region known as Moesia‚Äîimmediately joined the rebels, who also secured the assistance of the Cumans, a Turkic tribe inhabiting lands north of the Danube river. The Cumans soon became an important part of the Bulgarian army, playing a major role in the successes that followed. As soon as the rebellion broke out, Peter IV attempted to seize the old capital of Preslav but failed; he declared Tarnovo the capital of Bulgaria. From Moesia, the Bulgarians launched attacks in northern Thrace while the Byzantine army was fighting with the Normans, who had attacked Byzantine possessions in the Western Balkans and sacked Salonica, the Empire's second largest city. The Byzantines reacted in mid-1186, when Isaac II organized a campaign to crush the rebellion before it spread further. The Bulgarians had secured the passes but the Byzantine army found its way across the mountains due to a solar eclipse. Once the Byzantines reached the plains, the rebels did not risk a confrontation with the larger, better-organized force. Peter IV pretended he was willing to submit, while Asen travelled to the north of the Danube to raise an army. Contented, the Byzantine emperor burned the Bulgarians' crops and returned to Constantinople. Soon after, Asen crossed back over the Danube with Cuman reinforcements, declaring he would continue the struggle until all Bulgarian lands were liberated. A new Byzantine army was assembled under the command of the emperor's uncle John Doukas Angelos, but as Isaac II feared he would be overthrown, Doukas was replaced by John Kantakouzenos, a blind man ineligible for the throne. The Bulgarians attacked Kantakouzenos' camp during the night, killing a large number of soldiers. In mid-1186, another army under the general Alexios Branas was sent in. However, instead of fighting the rebels, Branas turned to Constantinople to claim the throne for himself; he was murdered shortly afterwards. Taking advantage of the chaos, the Bulgarians raided northern Thrace, looting the countryside before Byzantine forces could counterattack. On one occasion, the two armies confronted each other near the fortress of Lardea in an indecisive battle; the Bulgarians kept their plunder and retreated untroubled to the north of the Balkan mountains. In the late 1186, Isaac II launched his second campaign against Bulgaria. His army was forced to spend the winter in Sofia, giving the Bulgarians time to prepare for the invasion. Early the following year, the Byzantines besieged Lovech but could not seize it; they signed an armistice that de facto recognized Bulgarian independence. In 1189, when the leader of the Third Crusade, emperor Frederick I Barbarossa was at the brink of war with the Byzantines, Asen and Peter IV offered him an army of 40,000 in return for official recognition, but relations between the Crusaders and the Byzantines eventually improved. In 1190, Isaac II led another anti-Bulgarian campaign that ended in a catastrophic defeat at the Tryavna Pass. The emperor barely escaped with his life; the Imperial treasury, including the crown and the cross, were captured by the victorious Bulgarians. After their success, Asen was crowned emperor and became known as Ivan Asen I. Peter IV voluntarily stepped down to make way for his more energetic brother; Peter IV retained his title but Ivan Asen assumed authority. In the next four years, the focus of the war shifted to the south of the Balkan mountains. Ivan Asen's strategy of swiftly striking in different locations paid off, and he soon took control of the important cities Sofia and Ni≈° to the south-west, clearing the way to Macedonia. In 1194, the Byzantines gathered a huge force composed of the eastern and western armies, but were defeated at the Battle of Arcadiopolis. Unable to resist, Isaac II tried to ally with the Hungarian king B√©la III and make a joint attack against Bulgaria, but was deposed and blinded by his brother Alexios III Angelos. The Byzantines tried to negotiate peace but Ivan Asen demanded the return of all Bulgarian lands and the war continued. In 1196, the Byzantine army was again defeated at Serres, far to the south. Upon his return to Tarnovo, Ivan Asen was murdered by his cousin Ivanko in a plot inspired by Constantinople. Peter IV besieged Tarnovo and Ivanko fled to the Byzantine Empire, where he was made governor of Philippopolis. Peter IV was murdered less than a year after his brother's death. =Rise= A map of the Bulgarian Empire, showing territorial extent and the campaigns between 1185 and 1197 Church of the Holy Forty Martyrs where Kaloyan was buried. The throne was succeeded by Kaloyan, Asen's and Peter IV's youngest brother. An ambitious and ruthless ruler, he wanted to gain international recognition and to complete the liberation of Bulgaria. Kaloyan also wanted revenge the Byzantines for blinding 14,000 of emperor Samuel's soldiers. Kaloyan called himself Romanoktonos (Roman-slayer) after Basil II, who was called Bulgaroktonos (Bulgar-slayer). He quickly allied himself with his brother's murderer, Ivanko. The Byzantines killed Ivanko, but the Bulgarians took the city of Constantia. In 1201, Kaloyan captured Varna, the last Byzantine stronghold in Moesia, which was defended by a large garrison. Despite capturing the city at Easter, Kaloyan ordered every Byzantine to be thrown in the moat. He then negotiated peace with Byzantines, securing Bulgarian gains in early 1202. While the Bulgarians were occupied in the south, the Hungarian king Andrew II and his Serbian vassal Vukan had annexed Belgrade, Braniƒçevo, and Ni≈°, but after negotiating peace, Kaloyan turned his attention to the north-west. In 1203, the Bulgarians pushed the Serbs out of Ni≈°, defeated the Hungarian army in several battles along the valley of the Morava river, and recaptured their former territory. Kaloyan knew the Byzantines would never recognize his imperial title; he began negotiations with Pope Innocent III. He based the claims on his predecessors in the First Bulgarian Empire; Simeon I, Peter I, and Samuel. The Pope was willing to recognize Kaloyan as king on the condition the Bulgarian Church would submit to Rome. After lengthy negotiations in which both acted diplomatically but without changing their positions, Kaloyan was crowned king in late 1204. Archbishop Basil was proclaimed Primate. Kaloyan had no intention of submitting to that decision; he sent the Pope a letter expressing his gratitude for the Imperial title he had received and the elevation of the Bulgarian Church to a Patriarchate. Eventually the Papacy tacitly accepted the Bulgarian position regarding the Imperial title. The union between Bulgaria and Rome remained strictly official; the Bulgarians did not change their Orthodox rites and traditions. A map showing the greatest territorial extension of the Second Bulgarian Empire during the reign of Ivan Asen II (1218‚Äì1241) Several months before Kaloyan's coronation, the leaders of the Fourth Crusade turned on the Byzantine Empire and captured Constantinople, creating the Latin Empire. The Bulgarians tried to establish friendly relations with the Latins but were rebuffed and the Latins claimed their lands despite Papal recognition. Facing a common enemy, Kaloyan and the Byzantine aristocracy in Thrace made an alliance and the latter promised they would accept Kaloyan as their emperor. The decisive battle between the Bulgarian army and the Crusaders took place on 14 April 1205, at Adrianople, at which the Latins were defeated and their emperor Baldwin I was captured. The battle was a blow to the newly founded Latin Empire, which descended into chaos. After their victory, the Bulgarians retook most of Thrace, including the important city of Philippopolis. The unexpected Bulgarian successes caused the Byzantine nobility to plot against Kaloyan and ally themselves with the Latins. The plot in Tarnovo was quickly discovered; Kaloyan made brutal reprisals against the Byzantines in Thrace. The campaign against the Latins also continued; in 1206, the Bulgarians were victorious at the battle of Rusion and conquered a number of towns in Eastern Thrace. The following year, Boniface I, the King of Salonica, was killed in battle, but Kaloyan was murdered before he could begin the assault on the capital. Kaloyan was succeeded by his cousin Boril, who tried to pursue his predecessor's policies but did not have his capability. His army was defeated by the Latins at Philippopolis, reversing most of Kaloyan's gains. Boril failed to maintain the integrity of the empire; his brother Strez took most of Macedonia for himself, Alexius Slav seceded his territory in the Rhodopes; in return for help suppressing a major rebellion in 1211, Boril was forced to cede Belgrade and Braniƒçevo to Hungary. A campaign against Serbia in 1214 also ended in defeat. As a result of the growing discontent with his policy, Boril was overthrown in 1218 by Ivan Asen II, son of Ivan Asen I, who had lived in exile after Kaloyan's death. After his coronation, Ivan Asen II arranged a wedding with Anna Maria, daughter of the Hungarian king Andrew II, and received the captured cities Belgrade and Braniƒçevo as a dowry. He then signed an alliance with Theodore Komnenos, ruler of the most powerful Byzantine successor state, the Despotate of Epirus. With his northern border secured by the treaty, Theodore Komnenos conquered Salonica, greatly reducing the size of the Latin Empire. In 1225, Theodore proclaimed himself emperor. By 1228, the situation for the Latins became desperate; they entered into negotiations with Bulgaria, promising a marriage between the under-age emperor Baldwin II and Ivan Asen II's daughter Helena. This marriage would have made the Bulgarian emperor a regent in Constantinople, but in the meantime the Latins offered the regency to the French nobleman John of Brienne. Concerned with the actions of the Bulgarians, while marching on Constantinople in 1230, Theodore Komnenos invaded Bulgaria with a huge army. Surprised, Ivan Asen II gathered a small force and moved to the south to engage them. Instead of a banner, he used the peace treaty with Theodore's oath and seal stuck on his spear and won a major victory in the Battle of Klokotnitsa. Theodore Komnenos was captured along with his whole court and most of the surviving troops. Ivan Asen II released all ordinary soldiers and marched on the Epyrote‚Äìcontrolled territories, where all cities and towns from Adrianople to Durazzo on the Adriatic Sea surrendered and recognized his rule. Theodore's brother Michael II Komnenos Doukas was allowed to rule in Salonica over the southern areas of the despotate as a Bulgarian vassal. It is possible Serbia accepted Bulgarian suzerainty at that time to counter the threat from Catholic Hungary. In 1231, when John of Brienne arrived in Constantinople, Ivan Asen II allied with the Nicaean Empire against the Latins. After the Nicaeans recognized the Bulgarian Patriarchate in 1235, Ivan Asen II broke his union with the Papacy. The joint campaign against the Latins was successful, but they failed to capture Constantinople. With John of Brienne's death two years later, Ivan Asen II‚Äîwho could have again become a regent of Baldwin II‚Äîdecided to end his cooperation with Nicaea. His decision was further based on the assumption that after an allied success, Constantinople would again have become the centre of a restored Byzantine Empire, with the Nicaean dynasty as a ruling house. The Bulgarian‚ÄìLatin cooperation was short-lived; Ivan Asen II remained at peace with his southern neighbours until the end of his reign. Shortly before his death in 1241, Ivan Asen II defeated part of the Mongol army returning to the east after a devastating attack on Poland and Hungary. =Decline= Constantine Tikh and his first wife Irene, fresco from the Boyana Church Ivan Asen II was succeeded by his infant son Kaliman I. Despite the initial success against the Mongols, the regency of the new emperor decided to avoid further raids and chose to pay them tribute instead. The lack of a strong monarch and increasing rivalries among the nobility caused Bulgaria to rapidly decline. Its main rival Nicaea avoided Mongol raids and gained power in the Balkans. After the death of 12-year-old Kaliman I in 1246, the throne was succeeded by several short-reigned rulers. The weakness of the new government was exposed when the Nicaean army conquered large areas in southern Thrace, the Rhodopes, and Macedonia‚Äîincluding Adrianople, Tsepina, Stanimaka, Melnik, Serres, Skopje, and Ohrid‚Äîmeeting little resistance. The Hungarians also exploited Bulgarian weakness, occupying Belgrade and Braniƒçevo. The Bulgarians reacted as late as 1253, invading Serbia and regaining the Rhodopes the following year. However, Michael II Asen's indecisiveness allowed the Nicaeans to regain all of their lost territory, with the exception of Tsepina. In 1255, the Bulgarians quickly regained Macedonia, whose Bulgarian population preferred the rule of Tarnovo to that of the Nicaeans. All gains were lost in 1256, after the Bulgarian representative Rostislav Mikhailovich betrayed his cause and reaffirmed Nicaean control over the disputed areas. This major setback cost the emperor's life and led to a period of instability and civil war between several claimants to the throne until 1257, when the boyar of Skopje Constantine Tikh emerged as a victor. The new emperor had to deal with multiple foreign threats. In 1257, the Latins attacked and seized Messembria but could not hold the town. More serious was the situation to the north-west, where the Hungarians supported Rostislav, the self-proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria in Vidin. In 1260, Constantine Tikh recovered Vidin and occupied the Severin Banat, but the next year a Hungarian counterattack forced the Bulgarians to retreat to Tarnovo, restoring Vidin to Rostislav. The city was soon controlled by the Bulgarian noble Jacob Svetoslav, but by 1266 he also styled himself emperor. The restoration of the Byzantine Empire under the ambitious Michael VIII Palaiologos further worsened Bulgaria's situation. A major Byzantine invasion in 1263 led to the loss of the coastal towns Messembria and Anchialus, and several cities in Thrace‚Äîincluding Philippopolis. Unable to effectively resist, Constantine Tikh organized a joint Bulgarian‚ÄìMongol campaign, but after ravaging Thrace the Mongols returned north of the Danube. The emperor became crippled after a hunting accident in the early 1260s, and fell under the influence of his wife Maria Palaiologina, whose constant intrigues fueled divisions among the nobility. Constant Mongol raids, economic difficulties, and the emperor's illness led to a massive popular uprising in the north-east in 1277. The rebel army, led by the swineherd Ivaylo, defeated the Mongols twice, greatly boosting Ivaylo's popularity. Ivaylo then turned on and defeated the regular army under the command of Constantine Tikh. He personally killed the emperor, claiming the latter did nothing to defend his honour. Fearing a revolt in Byzantium, and willing to exploit the situation, the emperor Michael VIII sent an army led by Ivan Asen III, a Bulgarian pretender to the throne, but the rebels reached Tarnovo first. Constantine Tikh's widow Maria married Ivaylo and he was proclaimed emperor. After the Byzantines failed, Michael VIII turned to the Mongols, who invaded Dobrudzha and defeated Ivaylo's army, forcing him to retreat to Drastar, where he withstood a three-month siege. After his defeat, Ivaylo was betrayed by the Bulgarian nobility, who opened the gates of Tarnovo to Ivan Asen III. In early 1279, Ivaylo broke off the siege at Drastar and besieged the capital. The Byzantines sent a 10,000-strong army to relieve Ivan Asen III, but suffered defeat by Ivaylo at the battle of Devina. Another army of 5,000 had a similar fate, forcing Ivan Asen III to flee. Ivaylo's situation did not improve, however‚Äîafter two years of constant warfare his support was diminished, the Mongols were not decisively defeated, and the nobility remained hostile. By the end of 1280, Ivaylo sought refuge with his former enemies the Mongols, who under Byzantine influence killed him. The nobility chose the powerful noble and ruler of Cherven, George I Terter, as emperor. He reigned for twelve years, bringing even stronger Mongol influence and the loss of most of the remaining lands in Thrace to the Byzantines. This period of instability and uncertainty continued until 1300, when for a few months the Mongol Chaka ruled in Tarnovo. =Temporary stabilization= Bulgaria in the beginning of the 14th century In 1300, Theodore Svetoslav, George I's eldest son, took advantage of a civil war in the Golden Horde, overthrew Chaka, and presented his head to the Mongol khan Toqta. This brought an end to Mongol interference in Bulgarian domestic affairs and secured Southern Bessarabia as far as Bolgrad to Bulgaria. The new emperor began to rebuild the country's economy, subdued many of the semi-independent nobles, and executed as traitors those he held responsible for assisting the Mongols, including Patriarch Joachim III. The Byzantines, interested in Bulgaria's continuous instability, supported pretenders Michael and Radoslav with their armies, but were defeated by Theodore Svetoslav's uncle Aldimir, the despot of Kran. Between 1303 and 1304, the Bulgarians launched several campaigns and retook many towns in north-eastern Thrace. The Byzantines tried to counter the Bulgarian advance but suffered a major defeat in the battle of Skafida. Unable to change the status quo, they were forced to make peace with Bulgaria in 1307, acknowledging Bulgarian gains. Theodore Svetoslav spent the rest of his reign in peace with his neighbors. He maintained cordial relations with Serbia and in 1318, its king Stephen Milutin, paid a visit to Tarnovo. The years of peace brought economic prosperity and boosted commerce; Bulgaria became a major exporter of agricultural commodities, especially wheat. During the early 1320s, tensions between Bulgaria and the Byzantines rose as the latter descended into a civil war and the new emperor George II Terter seized Philippopolis. In the confusion following George II's unexpected death in 1322 without leaving a successor, the Byzantines recaptured the city and other Bulgarian-seized towns in northern Thrace. The energetic despot of Vidin, Michael Shishman, was elected emperor the next year; he immediately turned on the Byzantine emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos, regaining the lost lands. In late 1324, the two monarchs signed a peace treaty, strengthened by a marriage between the Bulgarian ruler and Theodora Palaiologina. Michael Shishman divorced his Serbian wife Anna Neda, causing a deterioration of relations with Serbia. This change of political course is explained by the rapid growth of Serbian power and its penetration into Macedonia. The Bulgarians and the Byzantines agreed to a joint campaign against Serbia, but it took five years until the differences and tensions between Bulgaria and Byzantium were overcome. Michael Shishman gathered 15,000 troops and invaded Serbia. He engaged the Serbian king Stephen Deƒçanski, who commanded an approximately equal force, near the border town of Velbazhd. The two rulers, both expecting reinforcements, agreed to a one-day truce but when a Catalan detachment under the king's son Stephen Du≈°an arrived, the Serbs broke their word. The Bulgarians were defeated in the ensuing Battle of Velbazhd and their emperor perished. Despite their victory, the Serbs did not risk an invasion of Bulgaria and the two sides agreed to peace. As a result, Ivan Stephen, the eldest son of the dead emperor by his Serbian wife, succeeded him in Tarnovo and was deposed after a brief rule. Bulgaria did not lose territory but could not stop the Serbian expansion in Macedonia. After the disaster at Velbazhd, the Byzantines attacked Bulgaria and seized a number of towns and castles in northern Thrace. Their success ended in 1332, when the new Bulgarian emperor Ivan Alexander defeated them in the battle of Rusokastro, recovering the captured territories. In 1344, the Bulgarians entered the Byzantine civil war of 1341‚Äì47 on the side of John V Palaiologos against John VI Kantakouzenos, capturing nine towns along the Maritsa river and in the Rhodope Mountains, including Philippopolis. That acquisition marked the last significant territorial expansion of medieval Bulgaria, but also led to the first attacks on Bulgarian soil by the Ottoman Turks, who were allied with Kantakouzenos. =Fall= The fortress of Baba Vida in Vidin The attempts of Ivan Alexander to fight off the Ottomans in the late 1340s and early 1350s failed after two defeats in which his eldest son and successor Michael Asen IV and his second son Ivan Asen IV may have been killed. The emperor's relations with his other son Ivan Sratsimir, who had been installed as the ruler of Vidin, deteriorated after 1349, when Ivan Alexander divorced his wife to marry Sarah-Theodora, a converted Jew. When their child Ivan Shishman was designated an heir to the throne, Ivan Sratsimir proclaimed independence. In 1366, Ivan Alexander refused to grant passage to the Byzantine emperor John V Palaiologos, and the troops of the Savoyard crusade attacked the Bulgarian Black Sea coast. They seized Sozopolis, Messembria, Anchialus, and Emona, causing heavy casualties and unsuccessfully laying siege to Varna. The Bulgarians eventually granted passage to John V, but the lost towns were handed over to the Byzantines. To the north-west, the Hungarians attacked and occupied Vidin in 1365. Ivan Alexander reconquered his province four years later, allied with his de jure vassals Vladislav I of Wallachia and Dobrotitsa. The death of Ivan Alexander in 1371 left the country irrevocably divided between Ivan Shishman in Tarnovo, Ivan Sratsimir in Vidin, and Dobrotitsa in Karvuna. The 14th century German traveler Johann Schiltberger described these lands as follows: Second Bulgarian Empire, 1331-71 The defeat of the anti-Ottoman coalition in the battle of Nicopolis in 1396 was the final blow leading to the fall of the Bulgarian Empire. On 26 September 1371, the Ottomans defeated a large Christian army led by the Serbian brothers Vuka≈°in Mrnjavƒçeviƒá and Jovan Uglje≈°a in the Battle of Chernomen. They immediately turned on Bulgaria and conquered northern Thrace, the Rhodopes, Kostenets, Ihtiman, and Samokov, effectively limiting the authority of Ivan Shishman in the lands to the north of the Balkan mountains and the Valley of Sofia. Unable to resist, the Bulgarian monarch was forced to become an Ottoman vassal, and in return he recovered some of the lost towns and secured ten years of uneasy peace. The Ottoman raids renewed in the early 1380s, culminating in the fall of Sofia. Simultaneously, Ivan Shishman had been engaged in war against Wallachia since 1384. According to the Anonymous Bulgarian Chronicle, he killed the Wallachian voivode Dan I of Wallachia in September 1386. He also maintained uneasy relations with Ivan Sratsimir, who had broken his last ties with Tarnovo in 1371 and had separated the dioceses of Vidin from the Tarnovo Patriarchate. The two brothers did not cooperate to repel the Ottoman invasion. According to historian Konstantin Jireƒçek, the brothers were engaged in a bitter conflict over Sofia. Ivan Shishman reneged on his vassal obligation to support the Ottomans with troops during their campaigns. Instead, he used every opportunity to participate in Christian coalitions with the Serbs and the Hungarians, provoking massive Ottoman invasions in 1388 and 1393. Despite strong resistance, the Ottomans seized a number of important towns and fortresses in 1388, and five years later they captured Tarnovo after a three- month siege. Ivan Shishman died in 1395 when the Ottomans, led by Bayezid I, took his last fortress Nikopol. In 1396, Ivan Sratsimir joined the Crusade of the Hungarian king Sigismund, but after the Christian army was defeated in the battle of Nicopolis the Ottomans immediately marched on Vidin and seized it, bringing an end to the medieval Bulgarian state. Resistance continued under Constantine and Fruzhin until 1422. The former was referred to by king Sigismund as the \\"distinguished Constantine, glorious Emperor of Bulgaria\\". Administration, territorial division, society The Second Bulgarian Empire was a hereditary monarchy ruled by a Tsar‚Äîthe Bulgarian word for Emperor that originated in the 10th century during the First Bulgarian Empire. The monarchs of Bulgaria styled themselves, \\"In Christ the Lord Faithful Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians\\" or variations, sometimes including \\"...and Romans, Greeks, or Vlachs\\". The term all Bulgarians was added in the 14th century following the loss of many Bulgarian-populated territories and signified that the monarch in Tarnovo was the emperor of all Bulgarian people, even those who lived beyond the country's political borders. The Medieval Bulgarian royal charters, such as the Rila Charter of Ivan Shishman issued in 1378, are an important source on medieval Bulgarian society and administrative posts. The Emperor held supreme power over secular and religious affairs in an autocracy; his personal abilities played an important role in the country's well-being. When the monarch was an infant, the government was headed by a regency that included the mother-empress, the Patriarch, and senior members of the ruling dynasty. As the processes of feudal fragmentation accelerated in the 14th century, it became customary for the monarch's sons to receive imperial titles during their father's lifetime; sons were styled co-rulers or junior emperors. Unlike the First Empire, the administration during the Second Bulgarian Empire was heavily influenced by the Byzantine system of administration. Most of the titles of the nobility, the court, and the administration were directly adopted from their Byzantine counterparts in Byzantine Greek, or were translated into Bulgarian. There were some differences in the ranking systems between the two countries‚Äîthere are few surviving sources about the precise obligations, insignia, or ceremonial affairs of the medieval Bulgarian administration. The Bolyar Council included the greater bolyars and the Patriarch; it discussed issues about external and internal policies, such as declarations of war, formations of alliances, or the signing of peace treaties. The highest-ranking administrative officials were the great logothete, who had the functions of a first minister, and the protovestiarios, who was responsible for the treasury and finance. High court titles such as despot and sebastokrator were awarded to the Emperor's relatives but were not strictly concerned with administrative functions. Panoramic view of Tarnovo, the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire The capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire was Tarnovo, which was also the centre of its own administrative unit under the direct authority of the emperor. Bulgaria was divided into provinces, whose numbers varied with the territorial evolution of the country. In surviving primary sources, the provinces were named with the Byzantine term hora or the Bulgarian terms zemya (), strana (), and oblast (), usually named after its main city. The provincial governors were titled \\"duke\\" or kefalia ‚Äî both from Byzantine dux and kephale‚Äîand were directly appointed by the emperor. The provinces were subdivided into katepanika (sing. katepanikon, from the Byzantine katepanikion), which were ruled by katepans who were subordinated to the dukes. During the reign of Ivan Asen II (1218‚Äì41), the provinces included Belgrade, Braniƒçevo, Boruy, Adrianople, Dimotika, Skopje, Prilep, Devol, and Albania. During the Second Empire, Bulgarian society was divided into three social classes: clergy, nobility, and peasantry. The nobility included the aristocracy: the bolyars, whose origin was the older Bulgarian boilas from the First Empire, the judges, and the \\"whole army\\". The bolyars were subdivided into greater and lesser bolyars. The former possessed large estates, which at times included tens and even hundreds of villages, and held high administrative and military posts. The peasants formed the bulk of the third class and were subordinated either under the central authorities or under local feudal lords. With time, the number of the latter increased as a result of the process of feudalization of Bulgaria. The main groups of peasants were paritsi and otrotsi. Both could own land but only the paritsi could inherit property; the latter could not, since it was provided by the feudal lords. Military Aerial view of the Shumen fortress, an important stronghold in eastern Bulgaria The emperor of the Second Bulgarian Empire was commander-in-chief of its army; the second-in-command was the velik (great) voivoda. The detachments of the army were led by a voivoda. The protostrator was responsible for the defence of certain regions and the recruitment of soldiers. In the late 12th century, the army numbered 40,000 men-at-arms. The country could mobilize around 100,000 men in the first decade of the 13th century; Kaloyan reportedly offered Baldwin I, the leader of the Fourth Crusade, 100,000 soldiers to help him take Constantinople. By the end of the 13th century, the military declined and the army was reduced to fewer than 10,000 men‚Äîit was recorded that Ivaylo defeated two Byzantine armies of 5,000 and 10,000 men, and that his troops were outnumbered in both cases. Military strength increased with the political stabilization of Bulgaria in the first half of the 14th century; the army numbered 11,000‚Äì15,000 troops in the 1330s. The military was well supplied with siege equipment, including battering rams, siege towers, and catapults. The Bulgarian army used various military tactics, relying on the experience of the soldiers and the peculiarities of the terrain. The Balkan mountains played a significant role in the military strategy and facilitated the country's defence against the strong Byzantine army. During wartime, the Bulgarians would send light cavalry to devastate the enemy lands on a broad front, pillaging villages and small towns, burning the crops, and taking people and cattle. The Bulgarian army was very mobile‚Äîfor instance for four days before the Battle of Klokotnitsa, it covered a distance three times longer than the Epirote army covered in a week; in 1332 it travelled in five days. Bulgaria maintained extensive lines of fortresses to protect the country, with the capital Tarnovo in the centre. To the north were lines along both banks of the Danube river. To the south were three lines; the first along the Balkan mountains, the second along Vitosha, northern Rhodope mountains and Sakar mountain, the third along the valley of the river Arda. To the west, a line ran along the valley of the river South Morava. During the Second Empire, foreign and mercenary soldiers became an important part of the Bulgarian army and its tactics. Since the beginning of the rebellion of Asen and Peter, the light, mobile Cuman cavalry was used effectively against the Byzantines and later the Crusaders. Kaloyan used 14,000 cavalrymen in the Battle of Adrianople. The Cuman leaders entered the ranks of the Bulgarian nobility; some of them received high military or administrative posts in the state. In the 14th century, the Bulgarian army increasingly relied on foreign mercenaries, which included Western knights, Mongols, Ossetians, or Wallachians. Both Michael III Shishman and Ivan Alexander had a 3,000-strong Mongol cavalry detachment in their armies. In the 1350s, emperor Ivan Alexander hired Ottoman bands, as did the Byzantine Emperor. Russians were also hired as mercenaries. Economy A silver vessel from the 14th century Nikopol treasure The economy of the Second Bulgarian Empire was based on agriculture, mining, traditional crafts, and trade. Agriculture and livestock breeding remained the mainstays of the Bulgarian economy between the 12th and 14th centuries. Moesia, Zagore, and Dobrudzha were known for rich harvests of grain, including high quality wheat.\\"Imago Mundi by Honorius Augustodunensis\\" in LIBI, vol. III, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 66 Production of wheat, barley, and millet was also developed in most regions of Thrace.\\"History of the Crusade of Emperor Frederick I by Ansbert\\" in LIBI, vol. III, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 267 The main wine-producing areas were Thrace, the Black Sea coast, and the valleys of the Struma and Vardar rivers in Macedonia. Production of vegetables, orchards, and grapes became increasingly important since the beginning of the 13th century. The existence of large forests and pastures was favorable for livestock breeding, mainly in the mountainous and semi-mountainous regions of the country.\\"History of the Crusade of Emperor Frederick I by Ansbert\\" in LIBI, vol. III, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 283 Sericulture and especially apiculture were well developed. Honey and wax from Zagore were the best-quality bee products in the Byzantine markets and were highly praised. The forests produced wood for cutting (–±—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—â–∞); there were also fenced forests (–∑–∞–±–µ–ª–∏), in which wood- cutting was banned. The increase in the number of towns gave strong impetus to handicrafts, metallurgy, and mining. Processing of crops was traditional; products included bread, cheese, butter, and wine. Salt was extracted from the lagoon near Anchialus. Leathermaking, shoemaking, carpentry, and weaving were prominent crafts. Varna was renowned for the processing of fox fur, which was used for production of luxurious clothes. According to Western European sources, there was an abundance of silk in Bulgaria. The Picardian knight Robert de Clari said that in the dowry of the Bulgarian princess Maria, \\" ... there was not a single horse that was not covered in red silk fabric, which was so long that dragged for seven or eight steps after each horse. And despite they travelled through mud and bad roads, none of the silk fabrics was torn‚Äîeverything was preserved in grace and nobility.\\" There were blacksmiths, ironmongers, and engineers who developed catapults, battering rams, and other siege equipment, which was extensively used in the beginning of the 13th century.\\"Historia by Nicetas Choniates\\" in GIBI, vol. XI, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 88 Metalworking was developed in western Bulgaria‚ÄîChiprovtsi, Velbazhd, and Sofia, as well in Tarnovo and Messembria to the east. Coin depicting Ivan Alexander with one of his sons, co-emperor Michael Asen IV (right) Monetary circulation and minting steadily increased throughout the period of the Second Bulgarian Empire, reaching their climax during the reign of Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria (reigned 1331‚Äì1371). Along with his recognition by the Pope, emperor Kaloyan (r. 1197‚Äì1207) acquired the right to mint coins. Well-organized mints and engraving workshops were set up in the mid-13th century, producing copper, billon, and silver coinage. The reform was initiated by Constantine Tikh Asen (r. 1257‚Äì1277) and led to a stabilization of the monetary market in Bulgaria. The Uprising of Ivaylo and the pillage raids of the Mongols in the late 13th century destabilized the coinage, resulting in a tenfold decrease of minting activities. With the stabilization of the empire since 1300, Bulgarian monarchs issued an increased number of coins, including silver ones, but were able to secure the market with domestic coins after the 1330s. The erosion of the central authorities on the eve of the Ottoman invasion gave rise to primitive, anonymous, and crudely-forged counterfeit coins. Along with the Bulgarian coinage, coins from the Byzantine Empire, Latin Empire, Venice, Serbia, the Golden Horde, and the small Balkan principalities were widely used. Due to the increase of production, there was a tendency to limit the circulation of foreign coins by the second half of the 14th century. Coins were minted by some independent or semi-independent Bulgarian lords, such as Jacob Svetoslav and Dobrotitsa. Religion =Religious policy= The Patriarchal Cathedral of the Holy Ascension of God in Tarnovo was the seat of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church during the Second Empire. It was part of a larger complex which accommodated the Patriarch. Following the liberation of the country, the recognition of the imperial title of the monarch and the restoration of the Bulgarian Patriarchate became the priority of the Bulgarian foreign policy. The continuous state of war against the Byzantine empire urged Bulgarian rulers to turn to the Papacy. In his correspondence with Pope Innocent III, Kaloyan (r. 1197‚Äì1207) demanded imperial title and a Patriarchate, basing his claims on the heritage of the First Bulgarian Empire. In return, Kaloyan promised to accept Papal suzerainty over the Bulgarian Church. The union between Bulgaria and Rome was formalized on 7 October 1205, when Kaloyan was crowned King by a papal legate and the Archbishop Basil of Tarnovo was proclaimed Primate. In a letter to the Pope, Basil styled himself Patriarch, against which Innocent III did not argue. Just like Boris I (r. 852‚Äì889) three centuries earlier, Kaloyan pursued a strictly political agenda in his negotiations with the Papacy, without sincere intentions to convert to Roman Catholicism. The union with Rome lasted until 1235 and did not affect the Bulgarian church, which continued its practices of Eastern Orthodox canons and rites. The ambition of Bulgaria to become the religious centre of the Orthodox world had a prominent place in the Second Empire's state doctrine. After the fall of Constantinople to the knights of the Fourth Crusade in 1204, Tarnovo became for a time the main centre of Orthodoxy. The Bulgarian emperors were zealously collecting relics of Christian saints to boost the prestige of their capital. The official recognition of the restored Bulgarian Patriarchate at the Council of Lampsacus in 1235 was a major step in that direction and gave rise to the concept of Tarnovo as a \\"Second Constantinople\\". The Patriarchate vigorously opposed the papal initiative to reunite the Orthodox Church with Rome; he criticized the Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Byzantine emperor for their apparent willingness to make concessions at the Second Council of Lyon in 1272‚Äì74. Patriarch Ignatius was called \\"pillar of Orthodoxy\\". Envoys were sent to the Patriarch of Jerusalem to negotiate an anti-Byzantine alliance, which included the other two Eastern Patriarchs, but the mission achieved nothing. Disputes with the Patriarchate of Constantinople over the legitimacy of the Bulgarian Patriarchate intensified in the 14th century. In 1355, the Ecumenical patriarch Callistus I tried to assert his supremacy over the Bulgarian church and claimed that under the provisions of the Council of Lampsacus it remained subordinated and had to pay annual tribute to Constantinople. These claims were not supported by authentic documents and the Bulgarian religious authorities ignored them. The structure of the Bulgarian Patriarchate followed the traditions of the First Empire. The head of the Church was the Patriarch of Bulgaria, who was a member of the State Council (Sinklit) and was at times a regent. The patriarch was assisted by a Synod comprising bishops, high- ranking clerics, and sometimes representatives of secular authorities. The Bulgarian Church strictly followed official state policy‚ÄîPatriarch Joachim III was executed for treason because of suspected links with the Mongols. The territorial extent of the Bulgarian Patriarchate varied according to territorial changes. At its height under the reign of Ivan Asen II (r. 1218‚Äì41), it consisted of 14 dioceses; Preslav, Cherven, Lovech, Sofia, Ovech, Drastar, Vidin, Serres, Philippi, Messembria, Braniƒçevo, Belgrade, Ni≈°, and Velbazhd; and the sees of Tarnovo and Ohrid. =Hesychasm= A depiction of emperor Ivan Alexander, patron of Hesychasm Hesychasm (from Greek \\"stillness, rest, quiet, silence\\") is an eremitic tradition of prayer in the Eastern Orthodox Church that flourished in the Balkans during the 14th century. A mystical movement, Hesychasm preached a technique of mental prayer that, when repeated with proper breathing, might enable one to see the divine light. Emperor Ivan Alexander (r. 1331‚Äì71) was impressed by the practice of Hesychasm; he became a patron of Hesychastic monks. In 1335, he gave refuge to Gregory of Sinai and provided funds for the construction of a monastery near Paroria in the Strandzha mountains in the south-east of the country; it attracted clerics from Bulgaria, Byzantium, and Serbia. Hesychasm established itself as the dominant ideology of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church with the work of the disciple of Gregory of Sinai. Gregory's disciple Theodosius of Tarnovo translated his writing into Bulgarian and reached his peak during the tenure of the last medieval Bulgarian patriarch Euthymius of Tarnovo (1375‚Äì94). Theodosius founded the Kilifarevo Monastery near Tarnovo, which became the new Hesychastic and literary centre of the country. Hesychastic intellectuals maintained regular connections with each other regardless of their nationalities, which significantly affected the cultural and religious exchange in the Balkans. =Bogomilism and other heresies= Bogomilism, a Gnostic, dualistic sect, was founded in the 10th century during the First Bulgarian Empire. It later spread throughout the Balkans and flourished after the fall of Bulgaria under Byzantine rule. The Eastern Orthodox Church considered the Bogomils, who preached civil disobedience that was particularly alarming for the state authorities, heretics. Bogomilism saw a major resurge in Bulgaria as a result of the military and political setbacks during the reign of Boril (r. 1207‚Äì18). The emperor took swift, decisive measures to suppress the Bogomils; on 11 February 1211 he presided over the first anti- Bogomil synod in Bulgaria, which was held in Tarnovo. During the discussions, the Bogomils were exposed; those who did not return to Orthodoxy were exiled. Despite the extant union with the Roman Catholic Church, the synod followed strictly the canons of the Orthodox Church. In the specially dedicated Book of Boril, the monarch was described as \\"Orthodox emperor\\" and the Synod of Tarnovo was added to the list of Orthodox synods. As a result of Boril's actions, the influence of the Bogomils was greatly reduced but was not eradicated. Many heretical movements, including Adamites and Barlaamism that arrived with exiles from the Byzantine Empire, established themselves in Bulgaria in the 14th century. These movements, along with the Bogomilism and Judaism, were condemned by the Council of Tarnovo in 1360, which was attended by the imperial family, the patriarch, nobles, and clerics. There are no sources about the existence of Bogomils in Bulgaria after 1360, implying the sect had already been weakened and had few followers. Persecution of the remaining Adamites and Barlaamists continued on a smaller scale, headed by Theodosius of Tarnovo and patriarch Euthymius. Culture The Second Bulgarian Empire was a centre of a thriving culture that reached its peak in the mid-to-late 14th century during the reign of Ivan Alexander (r. 1331‚Äì71). Bulgarian architecture, arts, and literature spread beyond the borders of Bulgaria into Serbia, Wallachia, Moldavia, and the Russian principalities and affected Slavic culture. Bulgaria was influenced by the contemporaneous Byzantine cultural trends. The main cultural and spiritual centre was Tarnovo, which grew into a \\"Second Constantinople\\" or \\"Third Rome\\". Bulgarian contemporaries called the city \\"Tsarevgrad Tarnov\\", the Imperial city of Tarnovo, after the Bulgarian name for Constantinople‚ÄîTsarigrad. Other important cultural hubs included Vidin, Sofia, Messembria, and a large number of monasteries throughout the country. =Architecture= The network of cities in the Second Bulgarian Empire grew in the 13th and 14th centuries; numerous new urban centres rose to prominence. The cities were usually constructed in difficult-to-access locations and generally consisted of an inner and outer town. The nobility lived in the inner town, which included the citadel, while most citizens inhabited the outer town. There were separate neighbourhoods for the nobility, craftsmen, merchants, and foreigners. The capital Tarnovo had three fortified hills‚ÄîTsarevets, Trapezitsa, and Momina Krepost, built along the meanders of the Yantra river. Several neighbourhoods along the river's banks including separate quarters for Western Europeans and Jews. Fortresses were built on hills and plateaus‚Äîthe Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates said the Bulgarian castles in the Balkan Mountains were situated \\"at heights above the clouds\\". They were built with crushed stones welded together with plaster, in contrast to the monumental ensembles in the north-east of the country dating from the period of the First Empire. The gates and the more vulnerable sections were secured with pinnacled towers; these were usually rectangular but there were also irregular, circular, oval, triangular, or horseshoe-shaped towers. Church of the Holy Mother of God in Donja Kamenica Religious architecture was very prestigious; churches were among the most decorated and solid edifices in the country. Throughout the 13th and 14th centuries, basilicas were replaced with cruciform, domed churches with one or three naves. The church's exteriors had rich, decorative ornamentation with alternating belts of stone and brickwork. They were further decorated with green, yellow, and brown ceramic pieces. This feature is seen in several churches in Messembria, including the Church of St John Aliturgetos and the 14th century Church of Christ Pantocrator‚Äîwhich had rows of blind arches, four-leaved floral motifs, triangular ornaments, circular turquoise ceramics, and brick swastika friezes running along the external walls. Every church in Tsarevets‚Äîover 20‚Äîand many of the 17 churches in Trapezitsa were decorated with similar techniques. A rectangular belfry above the narthex is a typical characteristic of the architecture of the Tarnovo Artistic School. Some churches, such as Holy Mother of God in Asen's Fortress built during the Byzantine rule, were reconstructed with belfries. The Church of the Holy Mother of God in Donja Kamenica in the western part of the Bulgarian Empire (in modern Serbia) is notable for its unusual architectural style. Its twin towers are topped off by sharp-pointed pyramidal elements, with additional sharp-pointed details in each of the pyramids' four corners. The towers and their design were entirely unusual and unprecedented in medieval Bulgarian church architecture and were an influence from Hungary or Transylvania. The ruins of a noble family's house in Tarnovo The Imperial Palace in Tarnovo was initially a bolyar castle; it underwent two major reconstructions under Ivan Asen II (r. 1218‚Äì41) and Ivan Alexander (r. 1331‚Äì71). The palace had the shape of an irregular ellipse and a built-up area of . The walls were up to thick. The entrance gates were guarded by round and rectangular towers; the main entrance was located in the round tower of the northern fa√ßade. The edifices were built around an inner yard with a richly decorated royal church in the middle. The Patriarch Palace was situated on the highest point of Tsarevets and dominated the city. Its plan resembled that of the Imperial Palace and occupied . A four-cornered bell tower adjoined the Patriarchal Cathedral of the Holy Ascension of God. The residential and office sections were located in the southern part of the edifice. Few examples of nobility houses have survived. To the north of the Imperial Palace, the foundations of a bolyar house from the beginning of the 13th century have been excavated. It had a –ì-shaped plan and consisted of a residential area and a small, one-nave church. There were two types of mass dwellings; semi-dug houses and overground houses. The latter were constructed in cities and usually had two stories; the lower floor was built with crushed stones soldered with mud or plaster and the second was built with timber. =Art= A depiction of Kaloyan and Desislava, ktitors of the Boyana Church The mainstream of Bulgarian fine arts in the 13th and 14th centuries is known as the painting of the Tarnovo Artistic School. Despite being influenced by some tendencies of the Palaeogan Renaissance in the Byzantine Empire, Bulgarian painting had unique features; it was first classified as a separate artistic school by the French art historian Andr√© Grabar. The school's works had some degree of realism, individualized portraits, and psychological insight. Very little secular art of the Second Empire has survived. Fragments of murals depicting a richly decorated figure were uncovered during excavations in the throne room of the Imperial palace in Tarnovo. The walls of the throne room were probably decorated with images of Bulgarian emperors and empresses. The frescoes in the Boyana Church near Sofia are an early example of the painting of the Tarnovo Artistic School, dating from 1259; they are among the most complete and best-preserved monuments of Eastern European medieval art. The portraits of the church's ktitors, Kaloyan and Desislava, and of the ruling monarch Constantine Tikh and his wife Irene dressed with ceremonial garments, are especially realistic. The Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo in the north-east of the country contain several churches and chapels that represent the evolution of the Bulgarian art in the 13th and 14th centuries. In paintings in churches of the first period, painted during the reign of Ivan Asen II (r. 1218‚Äì41), human figures are depicted in realistic style, with oval faces and fleshy lips. The colours of the clothing are bright, while the 14th century frescoes are in the classical style of the Palaeogan period. Both Boyana Church and the Rock-Hewn Churches of Ivanovo are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Frescos in the Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo In Tarnovo, no complete painting ensemble has survived. The thirty- five scenes preserved in Holy Forty Martyrs Church feature the mild tones and sense of realism characteristic of the school. Fragments of frescoes were excavated in the ruins of the seventeen churches in Tarnovo's second fortified hill, Trapezitsa; among them were depictions of military figures wearing richly decorated garments. The palace chapel was decorated with mosaics. In western Bulgaria, local characteristics of the remnant art include archaism in the composition and unshaded tones, examples of which are found in locations including Zemen Monastery, the Church of the Holy Mother of God in Donja Kamenica, and the Church of St Peter in Berende. Many books of the Second Bulgarian Empire contained beautifully crafted miniatures, the most notable examples being the Bulgarian translation of the Manasses Chronicle, the Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander, and the Tomiƒá Psalter, which together have 554 miniatures. The style of the miniatures, which depict a variety of theological and secular events and have significant aesthetic value, was influenced by contemporaneous Byzantine works. The Tarnovo school continued; it enriched the traditions and icon designs of the First Bulgarian Empire. Some notable icons include St Eleusa (1342) from Messembria, which is currently kept in Alexander Nevski Cathedral in Sofia, and St John of Rila (14th century), which is kept in Rila Monastery. Like the Boyana Church frescoes, St John of Rila uses realism and non-canonical design. Some of the preserved icons feature silver platings with enamel images of saints. =Literature= A page of the 14th century Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander The main centres of literary activity were churches and monasteries, which provided primary education in basic literacy throughout the country. Some monasteries rose to prominence by providing a more advanced education, which included study of advanced grammar; biblical, theological, and ancient texts; and Greek language. Education was available to laymen; it was not restricted to the clergy. Those who completed the advanced studies were called gramatik (–≥—Ä–∞–º–∞—Ç–∏–∫). Books were initially written on parchment, but paper, imported via the port of Varna, was introduced at the beginning of the 14th century. At first, paper was more expensive than parchment, but by the end of the century its cost had fallen, resulting in the production of larger numbers of books. Few texts from the 12th and 13th centuries have survived. Notable examples from that period include the \\"Book of Boril\\", an important source for the history of the Bulgarian Empire, and the Dragan Menaion, which includes the earliest known Bulgarian hymnology and hymn tunes, as well as liturgies for Bulgarian saints John of Rila, Cyril and Methodius, and emperor Peter I. Two poems, written by a Byzantine poet in the court in Tarnovo and dedicated to the wedding of emperor Ivan Asen II and Irene Komnene Doukaina, have survived. The poet compared the emperor to the sun and described him as \\"more lovely than the day, the most pleasant in appearance\\". During the 14th century, literary activities in the Second Empire were supported by the court, and in particular by emperor Ivan Alexander (r. 1331‚Äì71), which combined with a number of prolific scholars and clergymen, led to a remarkable literary revival known as the Tarnovo Literary School. Literature was also patronized by some nobles and wealthy citizens. Literature included translation of Greek texts and the creation of original compositions, both religious and secular. The religious books included praising epistles, passionals, hagiographies, and hymns. Secular literature included chronicles, poetry, novels and novellas, apocryphical tales, popular tales, such as The Story of Troy and Alexandria, legal works, and works on medicine and natural science. A page of the 14th century Bulgarian translation of the Manasses Chronicle The first notable 14th century Bulgarian scholar was Theodosius of Tarnovo (d. 1363), who was influenced by Hesychasm and spread hesyachastic ideas in Bulgaria. His most prominent disciple was Euthymius of Tarnovo (c. 1325 ‚Äì c. 1403), who was Patriarch of Bulgaria between 1375 and 1393 and founder of the Tarnovo Literary School. A prolific writer, Euthymius oversaw a major linguistic reform that standardized the spelling and grammar of the Bulgarian language. Until the reform, texts often had variations of spelling and grammar use. The model of the reform was not the contemporaneous language but that of the first golden age of Bulgarian culture in the late 9th and early 10th centuries during the First Bulgarian Empire. The Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria forced many scholars and disciples of Euthymius to emigrate, taking their texts, ideas, and talents to other Orthodox countries‚ÄîSerbia, Wallachia, Moldavia, and the Russian principalities. So many texts were taken to the Russian lands that scholars speak about a second South Slavonic influence on Russia. The close friend and associate of Euthymius, Cyprian, became Metropolitan of Kiev and All Rus' and took Bulgarian literary models and techniques. Gregory Tsamblak worked in Serbia and Moldavia before assuming a position at Metropolitan of Kiev. He wrote a number of sermons, liturgies, and hagiographies, including a \\"Praising epistle for Euthymius\\". Another important Bulgarian √©migr√© was Constantine of Kostenets, who worked in Serbia and whose biography of despot Stefan Lazareviƒá is described by George Ostrogorsky as \\"the most important historical work of old Serbian literature\\". Apocryphal literature thrived in the 13th and 14th centuries, often concentrating on issues that were avoided in the official religious works. There were also many fortune-telling books that predicted events based on astrology and dreams. Some of them included political elements, such as a prophecy that an earthquake that occurred at night would confuse people, who would then treat the emperor with disdain. The authorities condemned apocryphal literature and included such titles in an index of banned books. Nonetheless, apocryphs spread in Russia; the 16th century Russian noble Andrey Kurbsky called them \\"Bulgarian fables\\".

As a result of the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878), the Principality of Bulgaria, a self-governing Ottoman vassal state that was functionally independent, was created. In 1885 the autonomous province of Eastern Rumelia came under the control of the Bulgarian Tsar. Bulgaria declared independence in 1908. Administrative organization The Ottomans reorganised the Bulgarian territories, dividing them into several vilayets, each ruled by a Sanjakbey or Subasi accountable to the Beylerbey. Significant parts of the conquered land were parcelled out to the Sultan's followers, who held it as benefices or fiefs (small timars, medium ziyamet and large hases) directly from him, or from the Beylerbeys. This category of land could not be sold or inherited, but reverted to the Sultan when the fiefholder died. The lands were organised as private possessions of the Sultan or Ottoman nobility, called \\"m√ºlk\\", and also as an economic base for religious foundations, called vakŒπf, as well as other people. Bulgarians regularly paid multiple types of taxes, including a tithe (\\"yushur\\"), a capitation tax (jizyah), a land tax (\\"ispench\\"), a levy on commerce, and also various irregularly collected taxes, products and corvees (\\"avariz\\"). Religion Christian-born Dev≈üirme, would later serve in the elite Jannisary. In this miniature Janissaries march to the tunes played by the Mehter. The Ottomans did not normally require the Christians to become Muslims. Nevertheless, there were many cases of individual or mass conversion, especially in the Rhodopes.Petrov Petar. Fateful centuries for the Bulgarian ethnicity (in Bulgarian). Sofia, 1975 According to Thomas Walker Arnold Islam was not spread by force in the areas under the control of the Ottoman Sultan.The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 135-144 A 17th-century author said: > Meanwhile he (the Turk) wins (converts) by craft more than by force, and > snatches away Christ by fraud out of the hearts of men. For the Turk, it is > true, at the present time compels no country by violence to apostatise; but > he uses other means whereby imperceptibly he roots out Christianity... Non-Muslims did not serve in the Sultan's army. The exception to this were some groups of the population with specific statute, usually used for auxiliary or rear services, and the infamous blood tax (–∫—Ä—ä–≤–µ–Ω –¥–∞–Ω—ä–∫), also known as dev≈üirme, whereby every fifth young boy was taken to be trained as a warrior of the Empire. These boys went through harsh religious and military training that turned them into an elite corps subservient to the Sultan. These corps were called Janissaries (yeni √ßeri or \\"new soldier\\") and were an elite and loyal unit of the Ottoman army. Recruits were rarely gained through voluntarily accessions, as some parents were often eager to have their children enroll in the Janissary service that ensured them a successful career and comfort. First revolts and the Great Powers Battle of Nicopolis in the year 1396 While the Ottomans were ascendant, there was overt opposition to their rule. The first revolt began at the time Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund established the chivalric Order of the Dragon, 1408, when two Bulgarian nobles, Konstantin and Fruzhin, liberated some regions for several years. The earliest evidence of continued local resistance dates from before 1450. Radik (alternatively Radich) was recognised by the Ottomans as a voyvoda of the Sofia region in 1413, but later he turned against them and is regarded as the first hayduk in Bulgarian history. More than a century later, two Tarnovo uprisings occurred - in 1598 (First Tarnovo Uprising) and 1686 (Second Tarnovo Uprising) around the old capital Tarnovo. Those were followed by the Catholic Chiprovtsi Uprising in 1688 and insurrection in Macedonia led by Karposh in 1689, both provoked by the Austrians as part of their long war with the Ottomans. All of the uprisings were unsuccessful and were drowned in blood. Most of them resulted in massive waves of exiles, often numbering hundreds of thousands. In 1739 the Treaty of Belgrade between Austrian empire and the Ottoman Empire ended Austrian interest in the Balkans for a century. But by the 18th century the rising power of Russia was making itself felt in the area. The Russians, as fellow Orthodox Slavs, could appeal to the Bulgarians in a way that the Austrians could not. The Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca of 1774 gave Russia the right to interfere in Ottoman affairs to protect the Sultan's Christian subjects. Ottoman era textile canopy from Bulgaria. Bulgarian awakening Bulgarian lion, a symbol of revolutionary struggle during the second half of the 19th century. The Millet system was a set of confessional communities in the Ottoman Empire. It referred to the separate legal courts pertaining to \\"personal law\\" under which religious communities were allowed to rule themselves under their own system. The Sultan regarded the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Constantinople Patriarchate as the leader of the Orthodox Christian peoples of his empire. After the Ottoman Tanzimat (1839‚Äì76) reforms, Nationalism arose in the Empire and the term was used for legally protected religious minority groups, similar to the way other countries use the word nation. New millets were created in 1860 and 1870 for Uniate and Orthodox Bulgarian Christian communities. In this way a separate Bulgarian diocese was established, based on ethnic identity rather than principles of Orthodoxy and territory. Armed resistance to the Ottoman rule escalated in the third quarter of the 19th century and reached its climax with the April Uprising of 1876 that covered part of the ethnically Bulgarian territories of the empire. The uprising, along with the strategic interests of Russia on the Balkans, was a reason for the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 that ended with the establishment of an independent Bulgarian state in 1878, albeit far smaller than what Bulgarians had hoped for and what was originally proposed in the Treaty of San Stefano of 1878.

He is a multi-time supercross and motocross champion and the record holder for most main event starts in AMA Supercross history, with 265 starts as of 21 June 2020, with his career spanning almost 20 years. He was taught from a young age as being capable of competing at the sports most elite level. He has proven to be the most consistent supercross/motocross racer in the 2000-2009 decade, and has grown to be one of the sports most loved individuals, due to his years of experience and dedication to his sport. He has since ascended the international ranks of the sport to become Australia's most successful motocross racer.  Amateur career  As a small child, Chad owned a horse named Fern. After his cousin (Craig Anderson) started riding a bike, Chad instantly discovered his love for motorcycles and made the decision to trade in his much-loved horse in place for his first ever bike - a Yamaha PW50. The family soon purchased a small property located just outside of Kurri Kurri in NSW. The 25 acre property was overgrown with thick bushland, and was yet to even have a house or electricity on the land. The family went to the property to clear the tea tree shrubs by hand at any spare chance they could find, which resulted in the family home being built along with several tracks for Chad to practice on. Chad's family supported him along the way in his early years of competition. Without fail, weekend after weekend, his Dad (Mark), his Mom (Robyn), his younger Brother (Troy), spent the majority of their time travelling around Australia so that Chad could compete against the rest of the country. Chad was often dubbed as the 'underdog', but that was certainly something that would change in the future. Honing in on his skills on 80cc bikes, Chad's amateur career really started to take off in 1997 when he took the top spot at the Australian Junior Championship.  Australian career  = 1998-2000 = Reed formally began his professional career in Australia in 1998. He emerged from the Australian junior ranks to compete in the then-premier 250cc class, bypassing the traditional stepping stone of 125cc racing. Reed was immediately competitive in both motocross and supercross, winning the Australian 250cc Supercross Championship in 1999 and 2000. = 2007 = Reed revisited his home in Australia to race the Raymond Terrace, round 4, of the Australian Motocross series. He beat Daniel Reardon with a 1-1 performance, providing Reardon with international notoriety for holding Reed off for a significant portion of the races. = 2008 = In 2008 Reed was responsible for developing and partially funding the new Australian Supercross Championships, dubbed Super-X. He also competed in the series and dominated all but one race to take the Australian Supercross Championship. Reed won 6 out of the 7 races. = 2009 = Chad Reed, aboard his new Monster Energy Kawasaki KX-450F, won 4 out of the 7 rounds of the series. Reed won the championship by beating Daniel Reardon by 23 points. This is Reed's fourth Australian Supercross Championship. = 2010 = Reed raced the first round of the 2010 Super X series held at Energy Australia Stadium, Newcastle on a Honda sponsored by Vodafone. Reed won the event beating Americans Josh Hansen and Justin Brayton who finished in second and third respectively.  International career  = 2001 = Reed traveled to Europe in 2001 to compete in the FIM World 250ccc Motocross Championships, riding for Jan DeGroot's factory Kawasaki team. Reed was a revelation aboard his KX250, winning the Grand Prix of Lierop (Netherlands) and eventually finishing the year second to multi-time World Champion Micka√´l Pichon. He is the first Australian to win a world 250cc GP race. = 2002 = Reed moved to the US in 2002 and picked up a ride with Yamaha of Troy. Reed won all but two supercross races that season to win the 125cc East Coast Supercross championship. Reed won his first and only 125cc National victory at Mount Morris, PA, and finishing the season third behind James Stewart Jr. and Branden Jesseman. Reeds first ever SX race was in San Diego CA = 2003 = Reed moved to the 250cc class in 2003 riding for Factory Yamaha. In his rookie 250cc Supercross season Reed finished second to chief rival Ricky Carmichael, losing the title by only 7 points to Carmichael despite winning 8 races to Carmichael's 7. Reed finished his first 250cc Motocross season a distant third behind Carmichael and Kevin Windham. = 2004 = In 2004 Reed won the 2004 AMA 250cc Supercross series, battling with Kevin Windham, Michael Byrne and Tim Ferry with Reed earning 10 victories for the season. Reed finished 2nd to Carmichael in that year's motocross season. = 2005 = 2005 marked the much anticipated entry of James Stewart to the 250cc class alongside Reed and Carmichael. Each scored multiple wins making for an exciting season but again it was Carmichael winning the championship with 7 wins over Reed in 2nd with 5 wins and Stewart in 3rd with 3 wins. = 2006 = In 2006 Reed was again very competitive despite suffering a level three shoulder separation in mid-season which hampered his ability to compete to his highest ability. Going into the final event of the season, Reed and Carmichael were tied for the points lead, making the 2006 season the closest AMA Supercross championship in history. Reed took third place that night to Carmichael's second, narrowly losing the 2006 AMA Supercross title to Carmichael by only two points. Reed won 2 races that season.Reed was in 2nd in the AMA Nationals until he had to withdraw from the Nationals after the Millville round, citing the recurrent shoulder injury.http://www.vidchili.com/video/8CY2WVr_OPI/Chad_Reed_Hurts_His_Knee_and_Still_Races_Outdoor_Motocross_Unadilla_2006/ = 2007 = For 2007 Reed announced his plans to leave the factory Yamaha team to form his own private team, similar to Jeremy McGrath in the past. Obtaining support from Yamaha, The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, Thor and Nike, even brought in McGrath's former team manager Larry Brooks to spearhead the new effort, dubbed L&M; Racing. Reed took 1 win for the season and finished 2nd in the title chase to James Stewart, Jr. = 2008 = In 2008 Reed won 9 out of 14 races in the AMA Supercross season to edge out Kevin Windham and win the AMA Supercross title for the second time. This was a season full of great battles with Reed duking it out against Davi Millsaps, Kevin Windham, and Josh Hill for race wins, with Reed in the end winning the championship by 13 points over Kevin Windham.http://www.raceofchampions.com/en/drivers/chad-reed-3 = 2009 = Reed joined team Rockstar Makita Suzuki for the 2009 season. Reed battled hard with his rival James Stewart, Jr. during the 2009 AMA supercross championship, with the pair coming to blows on more than one occasion. He narrowly lost the title to Stewart by 4 points. Reed won 3 races in this season. Reed elected to race the 2009 motocross season after a 2-year hiatus. He won the AMA Motocross Championship at round ten, out of the 12 round series. He also won the Monster Energy Triple Crown Championship during the motocross season. He won 5 out of the 12 races in this season. = 2010 = For the 2010 season, Reed joined new teammate Ryan Villopoto riding the KX-450F for the Monster Energy Kawasaki Racing Team. Reed failed to finish during the round one final due to a collision with another racer's footpeg, breaking spokes in his front wheel. During round two he collided with James Stewart, Jr. in the final, breaking his hand resulting in another DNF. Reed returned to race round 13 of the supercross series, and despite having a bad start, Reed finished fourth. Chad Reed withdrew from competition stating he has Epstein Barr Virus. In an open letter published on his website Reed admits that becoming a new dad and also the death of his close personal friend Andrew McFarlane may be reasons people look to for his poor performance. = 2011 = After racing & winning the first round of Super X in Newcastle, Australia in October, Reed returned to the US to test various bikes and teams searching for a suitable 2011 team structure.

It is in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee. Its enrollment is approximately 900. History Pius XI High School, named in honor of Pope Pius XI, was founded in 1929. Originally it offered only the first three years of high school.Pius XI High School History Thus, the first graduation occurred in 1937, when the first senior class was added to the school. Enrollment grew from a class of eight in 1937 to over 2,000 students throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Current enrollment is approximately 900 students. The original four-story school building was constructed in 1930, with a two-story addition, for six stories total, completed in 1957. Additional classroom space, library space, science laboratories and general renovations were completed in 1998, and a field house was annexed in 2004. The original gymnasium has been remodeled into an auditorium, which was completed in the 2012-2013 school year. Academics Pius offers almost 200 courses, more than any other school in the state, including almost 20 advanced placement, honors and accelerated courses. In recent years, Pius XI High School has twice been named a National Blue Ribbon School.List of Blue Ribbon Schools U.S. Department of Education Pius has more national board-certified teachers than any other private school in Wisconsin. In 2007, several fine arts and English students were awarded 24 Gold and 16 Silver Key awards, some for portfolios from the National Scholastic Art & Writing Competition. In addition, several students have recently won awards and scholarships from the National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts, and the Wisconsin Regional ARTS Competition. Its students continue to receive awards for fine art. The Theater and English departments co-produced the Metro Milwaukee Young Playwrights Competition in 2005 and 2006 before the project was tabled. The newest academic department is engineering, which offers a certified program called \\"Project Lead the Way\\" that prepares students for college engineering programs and allows them to earn college credit while in high school. Schedules Instead of homerooms, Pius has TAC (Teacher Advisor Contact) rooms, a mixture of freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors. Each TAC is headed by a staff member called a \\"TAC teacher\\" that offers guidance to its TAC students. Pius has a modular scheduling system consisting of sixteen \\"Mods\\" of 22 minutes each, with 4 minutes between mods. Most classes are 2 mods long, making them a total of 48 minutes long (2 mods of 22 minutes, plus 4 minutes in between that are spent in class.). Courses meet two, three, or four times per week and last from 22 minutes to 90 minutes. This system provides flexibility in the frequency and duration of individual courses, and approximates the scheduling systems used by colleges and universities.Academics Pius XI High School Student government The Pius XI High School Student Forum is responsible for bringing student concerns to the administrative level, bringing administrative opinions, decisions, views and ideas to the student body, to solve or assist in the solving of school-wide problems and to act in the interest of the Pius XI community. The Forum is guided by a constitution that is renewed with each new set of representatives, board representatives and officers. The president of the Forum is elected to the position by the representatives at-large and the vice-president is nominated by the president and moderator, subject to approval of the Student Forum. Athletics Pius XI is a member of the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association and participates in the Woodland Conference. The male athletic teams play under the name \\"Popes\\", while the females are referred to as the \\"Lady Popes\\". For one season Pius XI Popes Football team was renamed the \\"Storm\\", after which the name \\"Popes\\" was brought back permanently. Despite the papal nickname, no visual imagery that alludes to the Pope is used at sporting events. The team had an unofficial mascot of the \\"Sugar Bear,\\" alluding to an advertisement from the 1960s. The \\"Sugar Bear\\" was absent from sporting events from 2004-2008 but made its triumphant return to the sidelines in 2009. It has been Pius' unofficial mascot for over 50 years. In 2010 the Lady Popes won their first WIAA Basketball State Championship. The Popes and the Lady Popes Basketball teams were the last two teams to win the Wisconsin Independent Schools Athletic Association (WISAA) boys' and girls' state basketball championships. The boys' basketball team finished with a school record of 24-1 and #1 in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's state and area polls.

The town sits at the southern end of the large and diverse Shire of Mitchell which extends from the northern fringes of Melbourne into the farming country of north-central Victoria and the lower Goulburn Valley. The township flanks the Northern Highway and is set against the backdrop of the Great Dividing Range. At the , Wallan had a population of 8,520.  Overview  The fastest growing town and now largest town in the shire, Wallan is a link between the city and rural towns such as Kilmore, Broadford and Seymour. 15 kilometres to the north is a turnoff to Strath Creek which leads through the Valley of a Thousand Hills. History A Wallan Wallan Post Office opened on 1 April 1858. A Wallan Railway Station Post Office opened on 1 October 1873, later renamed as Wallan Wallan East and closing in 1992. The first and only surviving store was begun by Hugh and Margaret Sinclair about 1860 with their 2-storey residence. In 1867 Thomas O'Dwyer began a store where the Wallan Hotel now stands. He converted the store to the Woodmans Arms Hotel in 1883. George Wallder and John Kyle supplied meat to the township. The first church erected in Wallan was a wooden building that cost 71 pounds and was opened by the Methodist residents in 1865. Wallan became part of the preaching circuit in 1864 and the following year the modest chapel was built. In the past, Wallan was a small village with only a few houses and a shop, but today it is known for the Hidden Valley Housing Development to the north. Until 1997 this was a private farm, however it has now been developed as a residential estate with a golf course running through the middle. The Wellington Square Shopping Centre, opened in 2004, includes many corporate franchise businesses (mainly Victoria's biggest supermarket chain Safeway), creating competition for the already existing Coles Supermarket across the road. In 2009, Wallan was used as a relief centre for those from surrounding towns affected by the Black Saturday fires.  Education  Wallan offers both primary and secondary education. Wallan Primary School is known for its excellent standing and highly regarded in the community. Private education can be sourced in the nearby town of Kilmore through Saint Patricks Primary and Assumption College. Childcare and Kindergarten programs in Wallan are offered by Eltham College Kids, Killara Child Care Centre and Dudley Street Child Care.  Transport  Wallan Train Station Mitchel Transit Bus service by shire Wallan station is well connected with the V/Line train network on the Seymour line. Mitchell Shire also operates a town to station connecting bus service for peak hour commuters. There is a bus service from Barmah that serves Wallan to Southern Cross station. Growth Wallan has witnessed substantial growth in housing. Traditionally the growth was in the northern side of the town in the Hidden Valley area. The start of the Wallara Waters estate in Wallan East is a new addition to the town. Being just outside Melbourne's metropolitan boundary, land in Wallan is fairly cheap which has allowed low-income families to make a living while commuting to the city for work. This has led to large growth in the town as it begins to take the form of an exurb. The railway station and nearby freeway access gives commuters quick access to the city. Public Transport Victoria has stated in their Metropolitan Rail Network Development Plan that Wallan should be connected to the electric Metro train network by 2033. Parks Wallan has parks in prominent locations, and within estates. It also has a small water park (running mainly in the warmer months) located in the town centre at Hadfield park, this is a large adventure playground with a small splash area and ample picnic spaces including sheltered seating with bbq facilities. There are very limited recreational facilities in the town. Walkways have been improved in recent years with re-vegetation of wetland areas along Watson st and storm water mitigation ponds around Wallara Waters.

It was founded on October 24, 1909, at Barnard College in Morningside Heights, New York City by seven Jewish women; Helen Phillips Lipman, Ida Beck Carlin, Rose Gerstein Smolin, Augustina \\"Tina\\" Hess Solomon, Lee Reiss Liebert, Rose Salmowitz Marvin, and Stella Strauss Sinsheimer. As a national sorority, it has multiple chapters across the United States, rather than a local sorority which has strictly one site location and chapter. Although it is a historically Jewish sorority, it is not a religious organization and welcomes women of all religions and race who honor, respect and appreciate the Jewish faith and identity and are comfortable in a Jewish milieu to pledge for sisterhood.\\"Home.\\" Alpha Epsilon Phi. Alpha Epsilon Phi, 2013. Web. March 6, 2013.  History  In 1889, Barnard College was founded as a women's college connected to Columbia University, which did not admit women at the time. A decade later, the campus had student organizations such as social sororities; however, not all sororities allowed Jewish women or other minorities to join at this time. The discrimination frustrated one student, Helen Phillips, who then fostered the idea for forming an organization for Jewish women to promise the same friendship and sisterhood as other sororities. Phillips suggested to some other women that they meet in her room and discuss the possibilities of such a club. These others were seven Jewish Barnard College students who would found the sorority ‚Äì Helen Phillips, Ida Beck, Rose Gerstein, Augustina Hess, Lee Reiss, Stella Strauss, and Rose Salmowitz. Alpha Epsilon Phi was formally chartered on October 24, 1909 at Barnard College. The founders were not chosen because of any special scholastic prominence, financial circumstances or other arbitrary standards, but because they had a common heritage, shared common interests and were imbued with the ideals of true friendship. The sorority encouraged community service, academic presence on campuses, an increased and positive social presence and reputation, and providing a \\"college home and family\\" for each of its sisters. This idea was the basis upon which Alpha Epsilon Phi was founded. \\"It was her [Helen Phillips'] idea and her persistence more than anything else that brought Alpha Epsilon Phi into existence,\\" one founder wrote. \\"I sometimes think that some of those ties were more necessary to Helen than to the others in this group because Helen had no mother and no sisters or brothers, and to her a group of adopted sisters was more of a need and had more significance.\\"\\"AEPhi Story.\\" Alpha Epsilon Phi. Alpha Epsilon Phi, 2013. Web. March 6, 2013. In 1951, the sorority joined the National Panhellenic Conference.  Symbols  The sorority's founders chose the pearl as the fraternity gem because of its glowing beauty gained through years of growth and the fact that it is a jewel that literally grows. \\"Pearls\\" are symbols for philanthropic events sisters participate in. Different activities or events have a different value of pearls that can be earned as members participate in philanthropic events. The founders also chose the colors green and white to represent growth and fellowship, respectively. The last symbol of Alpha Epsilon Phi which can be directly attributed to the founders is the flower, selected for its simple beauty and for the fact that it matches the sorority's colors. The lily of the valley's Hebrew translation is \\"shoshannat-ha-amaqim.\\" The columns of Alpha Epsilon Phi were added in 1916, the sorority's seventh year in existence. It was decided to create a simple insignia as opposed to an elaborate crest like that of most other Greek letter organizations. Each column of the insignia holds special significance to the members. The three columns Œë, Œï and Œ¶ represent faculty approval, student esteem and sorority fidelity, in order.\\"Phi Phacts.\\" Alpha Epsilon Phi. Alpha Epsilon Phi, 2013. Web. March 6, 2013. At the 1977 National Convention, the sorority chose the giraffe as their mascot. The Alpha Kappa Chapter at Miami University suggested this mascot, which was chosen because it stands the tallest and has the largest heart. Women who have passed their new member period and are initiated as full sisters receive a 24 karat gold badge with A. E, and Œ¶, on the front with 27 pearls. Œë has 8 pearls, Œï has 9 pearls, and Œ¶ has 10 pearls. On the back are the new sister's initials, marking it her own. = Motto and tagline = Multa Corda Una Causa... Many Hearts One Purpose was chosen as the open motto in the early years of the sorority because it best expressed the intentions of the founders of Alpha Epsilon Phi. Sisters have a handshake to greet one another and prove they are actual members of the sisterhood. In 2001, the sorority unveiled its updated image, complete with a new tagline: Above All Else. In full, the \\"Core Values Statement\\" is as follows: Above all else, Alpha Epsilon Phi inspires exemplary women who are: Enriched by sisterhood and unconditional friendships, Dedicated to selfless service and inspiring others, and Committed to intellectual growth and personal development. As a lifelong member of Alpha Epsilon Phi, I will: Respect our shared heritage and traditions, Exhibit high ideals and moral character, Fulfill expectations and responsibilities of membership, and Continually exemplify the values of beauty, strength and wisdom as embodied by the three columns of our insignia.\\"About.\\" Above All Else.

Glaser and her husband, Paul, later learned that she passed the virus to her children, Ariel and Jake, without knowing it. In 1988, the Glasers lost one child, seven-year- old Ariel, to an AIDS-related illness, and thus, they created the Pediatric AIDS Foundation with their friends Susie Zeegen and Susan DeLaurentis to honor their child.\\"Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.\\" The Foundation and Alpha Epsilon Phi (ŒëŒïŒ¶).

Rochelle Shorentz was brought onto the Federal Advisory Committee on Breast Cancer in Young Women by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention honorary members. Sharsheret inspired the launching of a national ovarian cancer organization. By interacting with young Jewish families, women, and men, Sharsheret recognizes the increasing need for knowledge about breast and ovarian cancers. The organization hosts a variety of national events, such as the 2013 NYC Schlep: Jewish Breast & Ovarian Cancer Run/Walk, in New York City's Bryant Park.

The river flows generally northwest, then west, joined by one minor tributary, before reaching its river mouth and emptying into the Western Port, near the town of Lang Lang. The river descends approximately over its course. The river is fairly slow running and does flood occasionally with resultant disruptions to major roads like the South Gippsland Highway and Westernport Road and it can often leave residents stranded in nearby town Lang Lang. Etymology The exact origin of the name Lang Lang is debated. One explanation is that it derives from the Australian Aboriginal Boonwurrung language, in which there are two names for the river recorded: Lang Lang Berin, meaning \\"stones\\" or \\"stony\\"; and Porbin yaluk, meaning \\"flowing creek or river\\".

His first work called Beginning of Spring was published in 1935. Novelist Atrpet gave the talented poet the epithet \\"Shiraz\\", because \\"this youth's poems have the fragrance of roses, fresh and covered with dew, like the roses of Shiraz\\" (Shiraz being one of Iran's major cities, famous for its roses and poets). Another version of his pen name is \\"Shirak azn\\"--a child of Shirak, the region he was from.

Burns, his predecessor, had become mayor automatically as City Council President on the resignation of William Donald Schaefer, but was not elected to a full term. He is the current president of the University of Baltimore (UB), and former Dean of the Howard University School of Law. Early years Schmoke was born and raised in Baltimore to Murray Schmoke, a civilian chemist for the US Army, and Irene B. Reid, a social worker. He attended the public schools of Baltimore.  High school  Schmoke attended the Baltimore City College, the third oldest high school in the United States and graduated in 1967. Schmoke excelled in both football and lacrosse and he was a star quarterback. As the varsity quarterback, he led the City Knights to two undefeated seasons and successive Maryland Scholastic Association A-conference championships in 1965 and 1966. As a student, Schmoke was a member of the Baltimore City College \\"A-course\\", a college preparatory curriculum that required him to take Latin and other advanced studies not offered to the average Baltimore high school student. Schmoke was elected president of the school's student government in his senior year but also worked in the Baltimore community with disadvantaged youth. Compulsory community service had not yet been mandated for Baltimore high school students, yet he tutored and mentored young men from the inner city as a member of the Lancers Boys Club.YAM November 2000 ‚Äì Powerful Persuader  College and graduate school  Schmoke entered Yale College in the fall of 1967. He played quarterback on the freshman team that year. Schmoke played in one of college football's most famous games in 1968. Harvard and Yale battled to a 29-29 tie in a battle of unbeaten teams. While at Yale, Schmoke and his classmates started a day care center on campus for the children of the university's janitors and cafeteria workers who lived in New Haven. The center was named after Calvin Hill, a former Yale football star who became a star running back for the Dallas Cowboys, and still stands today. Schmoke has been acknowledged as the undergraduate student leader who helped quell the possibility of riot on the Yale campus in the wake of the New Haven Black Panther trials in the spring of 1970. As New Haven filled with radical protesters, Yale students demanded the suspension of classes. A bitterly divided faculty met to discuss strategy, and invited a student leader to address the gathering. Schmoke, who was Secretary of the Class of 1971 and a leader of the Black Student Alliance at Yale, was selected to represent the students.Powerful Persuader, in the Yale Alumni Magazine, November 2000 He spoke only a few sentences: \\"The students on this campus are confused, they're frightened. They don't know what to think. You are older than we are, and are more experienced. We want guidance from you, moral leadership. On behalf of my fellow students, I beg you to give it to us.\\"Mayday at Yale: A Case Study in Student Radicalism, John Taft, Westview Press, 1976 This moment is credited with helping to dispel the growing tensions: the university voted to bend its rules, making classes \\"voluntarily optional\\" to the end of the term, and despite small outbreaks of violence, no campus-wide unrest resulted. After graduating from Yale with a degree in history in 1971,Biographies Schmoke studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1976. Schmoke was selected with five other distinguished former collegiate student-athletes for a Silver Anniversary Award by the NCAA in 1996. Early career After graduating from Harvard Law School, Schmoke joined the Baltimore law firm of Piper and Marbury. In 1977, he was selected to be part of the White House Domestic Policy Staff during the Carter Administration to work in the Department of Transportation. After one year working in President Carter's administration, Schmoke returned to Baltimore to serve as the Assistant United States Attorney, a position he held from 1978 to 1981.  Elected office  Schmoke and Curt Anderson in 1982 as they both launch their political careers In 1982, Schmoke ran for his first elected office. He challenged incumbent Baltimore City State's Attorney William A. Swisher in a citywide contest. Schmoke ran an energetic, grassroots and race- neutral campaign and upset Swisher in a landslide. On November 3, 1987, he was elected mayor of Baltimore. As mayor, he became known for his opposition to the \\"War on Drugs\\" and his stance in favor of drug decriminalization. Schmoke initiated programs in housing, education, public health and economic development. During his three terms in office Schmoke faced very serious challenges, including poor quality schools, drug addiction, and violent crime. Some of his controversial positions included advocating the decriminalization of drug use, and employing Nation of Islam security guards in a housing project. His achievements included improving the environment of low-income housing projects, a needle-exchange program for addicts, keeping the tax rate stable, and attracting the Ravens football team to Baltimore. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush awarded him the national Literacy Award for his efforts to promote adult literacy, and in 1994 President Bill Clinton cited Baltimore's programs to improve public housing and enhance community economic development and named Baltimore one of six cities to receive Empowerment Zone designation. In 1997, Schmoke served as a committee member for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence. After serving three terms as city mayor, Schmoke opted not to run for reelection in 1999.  Advocacy of school choice and school vouchers  In 1999 Schmoke delivered some remarks on the subject of school choice and school vouchers at a Manhattan Institute luncheon in New York. An edited version of a transcript of that speech entitled \\"Why School Vouchers Can Help Inner-City Children\\" is available online and in that brief web page, Schmoke explains why he believes [that] school choice and vouchers will improve the quality of public education for America's youth, particularly inner-city minority children.\\" Schmoke first came out in support of school choice in a speech at Johns Hopkins University in March 1996. Life after politics After leaving office in December 1999, Schmoke practiced law at the firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering in Baltimore. In 2003, Schmoke was appointed the dean of the Howard University School of Law in Washington, D.C. In 2004, Schmoke was appointed an honorary fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. He is also on the board of Global Rights, and a member of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. In 2008, Schmoke delivered the keynote lecture, \\"A New Hundred Years War? The Compelling Need to Reform National Drug Control Policy\\" for the Edward Bouchet Conference on Diversity in Graduate Education at Yale University. He also appeared in two 2004 episodes of the acclaimed HBO series The Wire. The episodes, entitled \\"Middle Ground\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\", featured Schmoke in a bit part as a health commissioner. He acts as an advisor to the fictional mayor after a rogue police major has legalized drugs in a portion of the city. This is a reference to his own feelings on the drug war. In July 2008 Schmoke became the acting Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs at Howard University. Schmoke continued as Dean of the Howard University School of Law. He also taught election law as a seminar class every fall semester to third-year law students. In January 2009, Schmoke was seen holding an umbrella for Illinois Senate designee Roland Burris during an outdoor press conference concerning Burris' seating controversy. Schmoke was part of the legal team advising Burris during the controversy. Schmoke was appointed Vice President and General Counsel of Howard University in July 2012. On May 14, 2014, the University of Baltimore announced that Schmoke would become its new president. On September 8, 2017, President Schmoke made the decision to have Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos as the Fall 2017 commencement speaker.

It is usually made by heating rice kernels under high pressure in the presence of steam, though the method of manufacture varies widely. It is a popular street food in India, Bangladesh and Nepal or street snack in Korea. Production Puffed rice is formed by the reaction of both starch and moisture when heated within the shell of the grain. Unlike corn, rice kernels are naturally lacking in moisture and must first be conditioned with steam. Puffed rice can be created by heating the steam-conditioned kernels either with oil or in an oven. Rice puffed in this way is crisp, and known as \\"crisped rice\\". Oven-crisped rice is used to produce the Rice Krispies breakfast cereal as well as the crisped rice used in Lion Bars, Nestl√© Crunch, Krackel, and similar chocolate bars. Though not as dramatic a change when compared to popcorn, the process and end result are the same. Another method of puffing rice is \\"gun puffing\\", where the grain is conditioned to the correct level of moisture and pressurized to around . When the pressure is suddenly released, the pressure stored inside the kernel causes it to puff out. This method produces a puffed rice which is spongy in texture. Rice can also be puffed by making a rice dough, and extruding small pellets which are then rapidly heated. The moisture in the dough flash boils and puffs the rice up. A cereal such as Cap'n Crunch is extruded, cooked, cut, pressurized, puffed and dried in a continuous process. The method of modern industrial puffed rice production is attributed to American inventor Alexander P. Anderson, who stumbled across puffing while trying to ascertain the water content of a single granule of starch, introduced the first puffing machine at the World's Fair in Saint Louis, Missouri, in 1904. His eight \\"guns\\" that puffed grains for Fair goers were dubbed \\"The Eighth Wonder of the World\\" by an advertising billboard poster. Once the puffing principle, technique and technology had been discovered by Anderson, the competition to puff ready-to- eat American breakfast cereal took over the economy of Battle Creek, Michigan, with Kellogg's and Quaker Oats being two memorable and still active names to endure through the early puffing frenzy. Usage = Korea = Gangjeong coated with puffed rice In Korea, puffed rice is known as twibap () and is used to make yeot-gangjeong or to coat gangjeong. = India = Spicy puffed rice In India, puffed rice is known as muri. Other regional names includes mudhi, murmuri and pori. It is a staple food in Odisha and West Bengal. Puffed rice is an ingredient of bhel puri, a popular Indian chaat (snack). It is offered to Hindu gods and goddesses in all poojas in the southern Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Pilgrims of Sabarimala often pack puffed rice in their Irumudikettu along with jaggery meant to be offered to Lord Ayyappan. Tamil saints say that Lord Ganesh loves pori, so it should be offered to him without fail. Pori has been mentioned in various Tamil literatures as an offering to Hindu deities. Offerings of pori and jaggery made to Vinayagar (Lord Ganesh) are mentioned in the Tiruppugazh, a 15th-century anthology of Tamil religious songs, written by Tamil poet Arunagirinathar. In Telangana, as a snack typically given to children, puffed rice or bongulu is made into ball with jaggery sugar syrup or bellam pakam. In Karnataka, puffed rice is mixed with carrots, tomatoes, spices and coriander leaves to make churumuri, a popular evening snack.

The competitors compete in alternating rounds of chess and boxing. The basic idea in Chessboxing is to combine the number one thinking sport with the number one fighting sport into a hybrid that demands the most of its competitors - both mentally and physically. The patronage of Chessboxing has been taken under its wings by the World Chess Boxing Organization (WCBO). It propagates the spreading of Chessboxing to all five continents. One of the goals of this new sport is the old idea of a healthy mind in a healthy body. During a Chessboxing fight the control of aggression plays a big role. That's why the motto of the WCBO is \\"Fighting is done in the ring and wars are waged on the board\\". Chessboxing was invented by French comic book artist Enki Bilal and adapted by Dutch performance artist Iepe Rubingh as an art performance and has subsequently grown into a competitive sport.Justus Bender: K√∂nigsdisziplin, In: Die Zeit. Nr. 39, 22. September 2005, ISSN 0044-2070 Chessboxing is particularly popular in Germany, the United Kingdom, India, Russia and other.  History  Chessboxing was invented by Dutch performance artist Iepe Rubingh. Rubingh's idea to create a new sport fusing the two disciplines, chess and boxing, originates from the 1992 comic Froid √âquateur‚Äîwritten by French comic book artist Enki Bilal that portrays a chessboxing world championship. In the comic book version, however, the opponents fight an entire boxing match before they face each other in a game of chess. Finding this to be impractical, Rubingh developed the idea further until it turned into the competitive sport that chessboxing is today with alternating rounds of chess and boxing and a detailed set of rules and regulations.Ada Calhoun: Chess-Boxing Hits It Big, Time, 2008-07-13 An earlier version of combining chess and boxing was said to have taken place in a boxing club outside London in the late 1970s. The Robinson brothers were in the habit of playing a round of chess against one another after a training session at their boxing club. However, no direct correlation can be made between the Robinson brothers' chess playing and chessboxing.Mark Chandler: Robinson Brothers The same goes for the Kung-Fu movie Mystery of Chessboxing (1979) as well as the Wu-Tang Clan's song \\"Da Mystery of Chessboxin'\\" (1993). Early history of the Chessboxing conception, sport and rules is detailed presented in the article of GROUPCHESS. = The early years (2003)= The first chessboxing competition took place in Berlin in 2003. That same year, the first world championship fight was held in Amsterdam in cooperation with the Dutch Boxing Association as well as the Dutch Chess Federation and under the auspices of the World Chess Boxing Organization (WCBO) that was founded in Berlin shortly before. Dutch middleweight fighters Iepe Rubingh and Jean Louis Veenstra faced each other in the ring. After his opponent exceeded the chess time limit, Rubingh won the fight in the 11th round going down in the history books as the first-ever World Chess Boxing Champion. The same goes for the Chess Boxing Club Berlin, created in the following year (2004), that is the first of its kind making Berlin the birthplace of chessboxing.WCBO: Pressemitteilung ‚Äì Battle of the Cities = 2005‚Äì2008: the first champions = A picture of a chess round in a chess boxing match in 2008. Two years after the first world championship, the first European Chess Boxing Championship took place in Berlin on October 1, 2005. Present-day chessboxing commentator Andreas Dilschneider was defeated by Tihomir Atanassov Dovramadjiev (FIDE Master ) when he resigned in the 9th round (chess),Andreas Dilschneider: \\"Was war da Los Herr Dilschneider?\\", In Der Spiegel, 42/2005 crowning the latter by being the first European Chess Boxing Champion. The event was covered by a number of world popular magazines and media as: Eurosport, CNN, Los Angeles TImes Die WELT, ChessBase and other. A video report by German television RBB for the event of the first European Chess Boxing Championship was presented in details. In 2006, more than 800 spectators filled the Gloria Theatre in Cologne for the world championship qualification fight between Zoran Mijatovic and Frank Stoldt. The 36-year-old Frank Stoldt, who was a former UN- Peacekeeper in Kosovo and Afghanistan, won when his opponent resigned in chess in the 7th round. After qualifying himself to fight for the title in 2006, Frank Stoldt went up against the American David Depto in November 2007 in Berlin to fight for the first world championship title in the light heavyweight division. More than 800 tickets were sold for the event at the Tape Club in Berlin, making it the biggest chessboxing title fight to that date. Frank Stoldt defeated Depto in the 7th round and thereby cemented Berlin's status as the leading city in the chessboxing world becoming the first German world champion.Berliner Morgenpost: Frank Stoldt ‚Äì Weltmeister in Schachboxen = 2008‚Äì2011: the chessboxing family grows = Chessboxing first received credit from the International Chess Federation FIDE, in April 2008; its president, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, took part in a chessboxing demo fight in Elista.FIDE: Kirsan as a Chessboxer In 2008, chessboxing clubs were founded in London and Krasnoyarsk. Created in 2009, the Los Angeles Chessboxing Club was the first of its kind in the United States and was directly followed by the New York Chessboxing Club in 2010. The Boxer in Munich also opened in 2010 and offers chessboxing training. In addition to the WCBO's initially European and then later world championships taking place worldwide, the scene at the London Chessboxing Club grew where chessboxing events take place on a regular basis. In 2011, the first international club matchup took place with Berlin and London in the ring‚ÄîLondon came out the winner with 2:1 won bouts.Arno Nickel: London schl√§gt Berlin = 2011‚Äì2014: chess boxing turns professional and goes worldwide = In 2011, the WCBO and with it the global chessboxing community made the biggest leap forward in its development to date with the foundation of the Chessboxing Organisation of India and its expansion in Asia, including also Chessboxing China and the Chessboxing Organisation of Iran which was founded in 2012. Furthermore, the third chessboxing organization in the United States, USA Chessboxing, was founded in 2011 and the European movement was being reinforced by the foundation of the Italian Chessboxing Federation in 2012. What's more, the professionalization of chessboxing started to take shape in the second decade of the 21st century. In addition to the WCBO that became a registered association under German law in 2014, the Chess Boxing Global Marketing CBGM GmbH‚Äîcalled Chess Boxing Global, CBG‚Äîwas founded, that , is responsible for organizing all of the professional chessboxing fights worldwide and above all, for the organization of the Chess Boxing World Championships. The Chess Boxing Organisation India was founded in 2011 by kickboxing official and former Indian kickboxing and karate champion Montu Das. With this, the growth of chessboxing in Asia gained momentum with the first Chess Boxing Organisation in Western Asia already being built in the following year by another experienced official in the kickboxing world: Fereydoun Pouya started the Chess Boxing Organisation Iran. At the same time, the process of turning chessboxing professionals reached a milestone: The 2013 World Championship in Moscow was the first chessboxing event organized and marketed by Chess Boxing Global. With three world championship fights in one night, more than 1200 spectators and a standard of fighting never seen before, the first CBG event set new standards in the history of chessboxing with Leonid Chernobaev leading the way. He has been able to make a name for himself with more than 15 years of chess playing experience and in the boxing world, as Marco Huck's and Yoan Pablo Hern√°ndez' sparring partner and having fought over 200 amateur bouts. He won the light heavyweight title against Indian fighter Shailesh Tripathi after a technical knockout in the 8th round (boxing). Sven Rooch secured his title in the middleweight class division- winning against Jonatan Rodriguez Vega after the Spaniard resigned in the 7th round (chess) and Russian Nikolay Sazhin won the heavyweight title against Gianluca Sirci by checkmate. Thus, Sazhin (Heavyweight), Chernobaev (Light heavyweight) and Rooch (Middleweight) would all go down in Chess Boxing history as the first Chess Boxing Global World Champions. They are also the first professional world champions in chessboxing ever.Nik Afanasjew: Knockout odor Matt In terms of its development into a mass sport, there was much success in 2013 and early 2014 for the chessboxing world. There were more competitors in the second and third Indian Championships in summer 2013 and early 2014 than in any chessboxing events ever before, with more than 245 fighters varying in both age and weight class, taking place in Salem and Jodhpur, respectively.Shamik Bag: Chess boxing catching on in India Furthermore, the chessboxing community in London‚Äîunder the command of London Chessboxing and the WCBA‚Äîhas continued to grow constantly since 2011 and by now stages chessboxing events for 800 or more spectators on a regular basis 4‚Äì5 times a year at the Scala, King's Cross. Late 2014 also saw Finnish Chessboxing Club being founded in Helsinki by five founding members. Since 2013, actively developing Moscow Chess Boxing club MCBF = 2015 to present: chessboxing today = Chessboxing events in 2015 were produced by London Chessboxing under the WCBA‚Äîtwo events at Scala, Kings Cross in London. The second event in June 2015, The Grandmaster Bash!, saw the British, European and IBF light welterweight world champion Terry Marsh fight and defeat Dymer Agasaryan. Terry Marsh (57) is the first professional boxer to compete in Chessboxing and has competed in 3 fights since June 2014 in London and still remains unbeaten in his career. The fight was one of the most compelling to watch as it went the distance, normal time ending in draw. After a deciding round of boxing Terry Marsh was awarded victory on points. Chessboxing has also become more popular among young, poor women in India where the sport has been seen as an alternative to traditional roles. Currently, the sport of ChessBoxing is actively developing and growing as popular and favorite sport for many people which try to find new realization and challenges. Actual number of local federations are officially registered in countries such as: China, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, India, Iran, Italy, Madagascar, Mexico, Netherlands, Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, USA, and other countrys In 2016, Then- FIDE president, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov publicly announced to \\"Top Sport\\" his desire to include Chessboxing in the Olympic games.  Rules  = Decisions = A chessboxing match can end by any of the following: * Victory by knockout or technical knockout in boxing * Victory by checkmate in chess * Loss due to exceeding the chess game's time control * Victory due to disqualification of their opponent by the referee e.g. due to inactivity due to overextended playing time (chess or boxing rounds following multiple warnings). **This rule prevents a player who is in an obviously lost position in one arena from stalling in order to attempt to win in the other * Loss by resignation (chess or boxing rounds) In the case that neither of the chessboxers win in regulation time and the chess game ends in a draw, the fighter who is ahead on boxing points wins the overall bout. In case the scoreboard is also tied, the fighter that used the black chess pieces will be named the winner (due to the first-move advantage in chess). This has not yet occurred in practice. = Weight classes = Like boxing, chessboxers are divided into weight classes. Currently, the following apply to professional chessboxing events of Chess Boxing Global ():  Men (17 years+)  * Lightweight: max. 154.324 lbs (70 kg) * Middleweight: max. 176.37 lbs (80 kg) * Light heavyweight: max. 198.416 lbs (90 kg) * Heavyweight: 198.416+ lbs (90+ kg)Chess Boxing Global: CBG Rules  Women (17 years+)  * Lightweight: max. 121.254 lbs (55 kg) * Middleweight: max. 143.3 lbs (65 kg) * Light heavyweight: max. 165.347 lbs (75 kg) * Heavyweight: 165.347+ lbs (75+ kg) For amateur and youth chessboxing bouts under the flag of the WCBO weight classes are graduated in 6-kilo-steps. In exception event hosts can classify into 10-kilo-steps.  Particular requirements and training  A chess boxer must have strong skills in both chess and boxing in order to be permitted to compete in a professional chess boxing fight. The current minimum requirements to fight in a Chess Boxing Global event include an Elo rating of 1600 and a record of at least 50 amateur bouts fought in boxing or another similar martial art. One deciding factor in chess boxing is that the fighters have to mainly train in speed chess; the skills required by speed chess are different from those for chess using classical time controls. However, chess boxing is not only the ability to master both sports but above all, being able to withstand the constant switch from a full contact sport to a thinking sport, round after round. After three minutes of boxing, pulses are racing, yet the opponents have to face each other at the chessboard barely having taken a break, and have to then perform calmly and think tactically. This switch becomes increasingly hard for the athletes as the fight goes on and they become tired. In order to train these skills, a specialised chess boxing training is used, in which physical interval training forms are combined with blitz or speed chess games. Thereby the fighters adapt the rhythm of a chessboxing bout. They will use exercises like \\"track chess\\" and \\"stair chess\\" in which training partners will play an 18-minute game of speed chess over six rounds with intensive running exercises in between, such as 400-meter sprints or stair sprints. Other common methods of training combine speed chess games with strength exercises such as push- ups. The classic chess boxing training is box sparring combined with a game of speed chess.

It is situated about north of Parma, not far from the northern bank of the Po River. It was inscribed in the World Heritage List in 2008.  History  Sabbioneta was founded by Vespasiano I Gonzaga in the late 16th century along the ancient Roman Via Vitelliana, on a sandy bank of the Po (whence the name, meaning \\"sandy\\" in Italian); he was its first duke, using it as a personal fortress and residence. It was also during this period that it became a minor musical centre; composers such as Benedetto Pallavicino (c. 1551-1601) were employed here by Vespasiano Gonzaga, prior to his moving to the main Gonzaga city of Mantua. Statue of Vespasiano I Gonzaga.Located on an alluvial ground between the Po and Oglio rivers, as well as along the route of the ancient Via Vitelliana, it occupied a strategic position in the heart of the Po Valley. For Vespasiano Gonzaga, Sabbioneta was to be above all a fortress and, at that time, the power of its walls certainly made it one of the most well-equipped bulwarks in Lombardy of Spanish domination. Sabbioneta was above all the capital of a small state placed between great regional states: the Duchy of Milan to the west, ruled at that time by the Spanish governorate; the Duchy of Mantua to the east, over the River Oglio, governed by ancient line of the Gonzaga, cousins of Vespasiano; the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza to the south of Po, under the domain of Farnese family, supportive of Gonzaga himself. The territory of the small state of Sabbioneta was mainly concentrated in the eastern extremity of the diocese of Cremona and it represented a necessary crossroads both for trade midway along the Po and for communications between the lowlands of Brescia and Emilia Romagna. The most prosperous period in the history of this city was in its reconstruction years, in which it was under the dominion of Prince Vespasiano I Gonzaga, which also became his residence. Sabbioneta has been honored with the ‚Äúorange flag‚Äù eulogy of the Touring Club of Italy. Main Sights The territory features the church of St. Anthony Abbot in the district of Villa Pasquali, designed by Ferdinando Galli-Bibbiena and built by his son Antonio Galli, and the small sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Vigoreto that in ancient times was annexed to the convent of the Capuchins. Outside the gunnel city, the district banks of Vespasiano I Gonzaga are also reported: a system of artificial raised parts that enclose the city of Sabbioneta and a wide part of the adjacent council territory, marking a vast ring-like circuit of about twenty kilometers.In 2008, Sabbioneta was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List as a recognition of its perfect example of practical application of Renaissance urban planning theories. Sabbioneta is also known for its historic Jewish Ghetto and Synagogue, and in particular for its Hebrew printing-press. In 1551 Tobias Foa set up the press; he had, however, published certain \\"anti-Christian books\\" and his career was \\"forcibly ended\\". His work and possibly his type were taken up by a Christian printer, Vicenzo Conte. Vespasiano Gonzaga's town, designed according to the Renaissance principles of the Ideal City, included: *The Ducal Palace (now the Town Hall) *The Teatro all'antica (\\"Theatre in the style of the Ancients\\"), designed by Vincenzo Scamozzi *The Galleria degli Antichi and Palazzo del Giardino: \\"Gallery of the Ancient\\" and \\"Garden Palace\\" respectively.) *Churches of the Assunta and Carmine *Chiesa della Beata Vergine Incoronata The church and the summer palace contain frescoes by artists of the Campi family of Cremona. Paolo Monti - Serie fotografica (Sabbioneta, 1965) - BEIC 6364228.jpgPorta Vittoria  World Heritage Site  On 7th July 2008, Sabbioneta, together with Mantua was declared by UNESCO to be a World Heritage Site due to its exceptional nature as a newly founded city built in just over 30 years by the will of Prince Vespasiano I Gonzaga. According to UNESCO, Sabbioneta represents a perfect example of the application of Renaissance theories on how an ideal city should be designed. The vicissitudes that immediately occurred after the death of Vespasiano, especially the long-standing question of the succession of the small duchy, which divided the heirs for almost a century, as well as the Austrian dominion first and the Napoleonic one later, deprived the city of important buildings, such as the fortress, the armoury and the lunettes placed outside the city wall. Pillage and confiscation deprived the city of some prestigious features, firstly, the confiscation of the antique collection to the Academy of Mantua in 1772 by the Teresian decree and the burning of the Sala dei Cavalli in the Palazzo Ducale in 1815. The church heritage remains conspicuous, promoted and redeveloped by a policy of recovery and enhancement over the last 25 years.  References in Art  According to the American lawyer and writer Richard Paul Roe, the play A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream by William Shakespeare was not set in Athens but in Sabbioneta, known as ‚Äúlittle Athens‚Äù ever since its foundation.  Cinema and Television  In 1970 in Sabbioneta shooting of the film The Spider's Strategem by Bernardo Bertolucci was made. On the occasion of the film, the village takes on the imaginary name of Tara. Inside the Gallery of the Ancients and in some rooms of the Palace Garden, some scenes of 'Tis Pity She's a Whore, were filmed in 1971. More recently (1980s) in Sabbioneta the shooting of the RAI television show I Promessi Sposi ('The Betrothed') was also filmed: in particular, amid the columns of the Gallery of the Ancients, scenes of the plague were shot. Also for the French film Marquise, released in 1997 under the direction of V√©ra Belmont, some scenes were shot in Sabbioneta, as well as for the 1999 film Amore nello specchio by Salvatore Maira, in which the Teatro all'Antica was used. The second season of the television series I Medici, broadcast in 2018, used Sabbioneta in some scenes to represent Renaissance Florence.

The ratios of isotopes in a sample material are measured by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry against an isotopic reference material. This process is called isotope analysis. Stable isotopes The atomic mass of different isotopes affect their chemical kinetic behavior, leading to natural isotope separation processes. =Carbon isotopes= For example, different sources and sinks of methane have different affinity for the 12C and 13C isotopes, which allows distinguishing between different sources by the 13C/12C ratio in methane in the air. In geochemistry, paleoclimatology and paleoceanography this ratio is called Œ¥13C. The ratio is calculated with respect to Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) standard: :delta ce{^{13}C}_mathrm{sample} = left(frac{ce{^{13}C/^{12}C}_ce{sample}}{ce{^{13}C/^{12}C}_mathrm{standard}} - 1right) cdot 1000 ‚Ä∞ Similarly, carbon in inorganic carbonates shows little isotopic fractionation, while carbon in materials originated by photosynthesis is depleted of the heavier isotopes. In addition, there are two types of plants with different biochemical pathways; the C3 carbon fixation, where the isotope separation effect is more pronounced, C4 carbon fixation, where the heavier 13C is less depleted, and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) plants, where the effect is similar but less pronounced than with C4 plants. Isotopic fractionation in plants is caused by physical (slower diffusion of 13C in plant tissues due to increased atomic weight) and biochemical (preference of 12C by two enzymes: RuBisCO and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase) factors.Park S. Nobel (2009) Physicochemical and Environmental Plant Physiology. P.410. The different isotope ratios for the two kinds of plants propagate through the food chain, thus it is possible to determine if the principal diet of a human or an animal consists primarily of C3 plants (rice, wheat, soybeans, potatoes) or C4 plants (corn, or corn-fed beef) by isotope analysis of their flesh and bone collagen (however, to obtain more accurate determinations, carbon isotopic fractionation must be also taken into account, since several studies have reported significant 13C discrimination during biodegradation of simple and complex substrates). Within C3 plants processes regulating changes in Œ¥13C are well understood, particularly at the leaf level, but also during wood formation. Many recent studies combine leaf level isotopic fractionation with annual patterns of wood formation (i.e. tree ring Œ¥13C) to quantify the impacts of climatic variations and atmospheric composition on physiological processes of individual trees and forest stands. The next phase of understanding, in terrestrial ecosystems at least, seems to be the combination of multiple isotopic proxies to decipher interactions between plants, soils and the atmosphere, and predict how changes in land use will affect climate change. Similarly, marine fish contain more 13C than freshwater fish, with values approximating the C4 and C3 plants respectively. The ratio of carbon-13 and carbon-12 isotopes in these types of plants is as follows: * C4 plants: -16 to -10 ‚Ä∞ * CAM plants: -20 to -10 ‚Ä∞ * C3 plants: -33 to -24 ‚Ä∞ Limestones formed by precipitation in seas from the atmospheric carbon dioxide contain normal proportion of 13C. Conversely, calcite found in salt domes originates from carbon dioxide formed by oxidation of petroleum, which due to its plant origin is 13C-depleted. The layer of limestone deposited at the Permian extinction 252 Mya can be identified by the 1% drop in 13C/12C. The 14C isotope is important in distinguishing biosynthetized materials from man-made ones. Biogenic chemicals are derived from biospheric carbon, which contains 14C. Carbon in artificially made chemicals is usually derived from fossil fuels like coal or petroleum, where the 14C originally present has decayed below detectable limits. The amount of 14C currently present in a sample therefore indicates the proportion of carbon of biogenic origin. =Nitrogen isotopes= Nitrogen-15, or 15N, is often used in agricultural and medical research, for example in the Meselson‚ÄìStahl experiment to establish the nature of DNA replication. An extension of this research resulted in development of DNA-based stable-isotope probing, which allows examination of links between metabolic function and taxonomic identity of microorganisms in the environment, without the need for culture isolation. Proteins can be isotopically labelled by cultivating them in a medium containing 15N as the only source of nitrogen, e.g., in quantitative proteomics such as SILAC. Nitrogen-15 is extensively used to trace mineral nitrogen compounds (particularly fertilizers) in the environment. When combined with the use of other isotopic labels, 15N is also a very important tracer for describing the fate of nitrogenous organic pollutants. Nitrogen-15 tracing is an important method used in biogeochemistry. The ratio of stable nitrogen isotopes, 15N/14N or Œ¥15N, tends to increase with trophic level, such that herbivores have higher nitrogen isotope values than plants, and carnivores have higher nitrogen isotope values than herbivores. Depending on the tissue being examined, there tends to be an increase of 3-4 parts per thousand with each increase in trophic level. The tissues and hair of vegans therefore contain significantly lower Œ¥15N than the bodies of people who eat mostly meat. Similarly, a terrestrial diet produces a different signature than a marine- based diet. Isotopic analysis of hair is an important source of information for archaeologists, providing clues about the ancient diets and differing cultural attitudes to food sources.Michael P. Richardsa,b,1 and Erik Trinkausc Isotopic evidence for the diets of European Neanderthals and early modern humans PNAS September 22, 2009vol. 106 no. 38 16034-16039 A number of other environmental and physiological factors can influence the nitrogen isotopic composition at the base of the food web (i.e. in plants) or at the level of individual animals. For example, in arid regions, the nitrogen cycle tends to be more 'open' and prone to the loss of 14N, increasing Œ¥15N in soils and plants. This leads to relatively high Œ¥15N values in plants and animals in hot and arid ecosystems relative to cooler and moister ecosystems. Furthermore, elevated Œ¥15N have been linked to the preferential excretion of 14N and reutilization of already enriched 15N tissues in the body under prolonged water stress conditions or insufficient protein intake. Œ¥15N also provides a diagnostic tool in planetary science as the ratio exhibited in atmospheres and surface materials \\"is closely tied to the conditions under which materials form\\". =Oxygen isotopes= Oxygen comes in three variants, but the 17O is so rare that it is very difficult to detect (~0.04% abundant). The ratio of 18O/16O in water depends on the amount of evaporation the water experienced (as 18O is heavier and therefore less likely to vaporize). As the vapor tension depends on the concentration of dissolved salts, the 18O/16O ratio shows correlation on the salinity and temperature of water. As oxygen gets built into the shells of calcium carbonate secreting organisms, such sediments prove a chronological record of temperature and salinity of the water in the area. Oxygen isotope ratio in atmosphere varies predictably with time of year and geographic location; e.g. there is a 2% difference between 18O-rich precipitation in Montana and 18O-depleted precipitation in Florida Keys. This variability can be used for approximate determination of geographic location of origin of a material; e.g. it is possible to determine where a shipment of uranium oxide was produced. The rate of exchange of surface isotopes with the environment has to be taken in account.Nuclear Forensic Analysis - Kenton J. Moody, Ian D. Hutcheon, Patrick M. Grant - Google Boeken The oxygen isotopic signatures of solid samples (organic and inorganic) are usually measured with pyrolysis and mass spectrometry. Researchers need to avoid improper or prolonged storage of the samples for accurate measurements. Radiogenic isotopes =Lead isotopes= Lead consists of four stable isotopes: 204Pb, 206Pb, 207Pb, and 208Pb. Local variations in uranium/thorium/lead content cause a wide location-specific variation of isotopic ratios for lead from different localities. Lead emitted to the atmosphere by industrial processes has an isotopic composition different from lead in minerals. Combustion of gasoline with tetraethyllead additive led to formation of ubiquitous micrometer-sized lead-rich particulates in car exhaust smoke; especially in urban areas the man-made lead particles are much more common than natural ones. The differences in isotopic content in particles found in objects can be used for approximate geolocation of the object's origin. Radioactive isotopes Hot particles, radioactive particles of nuclear fallout and radioactive waste, also exhibit distinct isotopic signatures. Their radionuclide composition (and thus their age and origin) can be determined by mass spectrometry or by gamma spectrometry. For example, particles generated by a nuclear blast contain detectable amounts of 60Co and 152Eu. The Chernobyl accident did not release these particles but did release 125Sb and 144Ce. Particles from underwater bursts will consist mostly of irradiated sea salts. Ratios of 152Eu/155Eu, 154Eu/155Eu, and 238Pu/239Pu are also different for fusion and fission nuclear weapons, which allows identification of hot particles of unknown origin. Applications =Archaeological studies= In archaeological studies, stable isotope ratios have been used to track diet within the time span formation of analyzed tissues (10‚Äì15 years for bone collagen and intra-annual periods for tooth enamel bioapatite) from individuals; \\"recipes\\" of foodstuffs (ceramic vessel residues); locations of cultivation and types of plants grown (chemical extractions from sediments); and migration of individuals (dental material). =Forensics= With the advent of stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry, isotopic signatures of materials find increasing use in forensics, distinguishing the origin of otherwise similar materials and tracking the materials to their common source. For example, the isotope signatures of plants can be to a degree influenced by the growth conditions, including moisture and nutrient availability. In case of synthetic materials, the signature is influenced by the conditions during the chemical reaction. The isotopic signature profiling is useful in cases where other kinds of profiling, e.g. characterization of impurities, are not optimal. Electronics coupled with scintillator detectors are routinely used to evaluate isotope signatures and identify unknown sources. A study was published demonstrating the possibility of determination of the origin of a common brown PSA packaging tape by using the carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen isotopic signature of the backing polymer, additives, and adhesive. Measurement of carbon isotopic ratios can be used for detection of adulteration of honey. Addition of sugars originated from corn or sugar cane (C4 plants) skews the isotopic ratio of sugars present in honey, but does not influence the isotopic ratio of proteins; in an unadulterated honey the carbon isotopic ratios of sugars and proteins should match. As low as 7% level of addition can be detected.PDF Nuclear explosions form 10Be by a reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the historical indicators of past activity at nuclear test sites. =Solar system origins= Isotopic fingerprints are used to study the origin of materials in the Solar System. For example, the Moon's oxygen isotopic ratios seem to be essentially identical to Earth's. Oxygen isotopic ratios, which may be measured very precisely, yield a unique and distinct signature for each solar system body. Different oxygen isotopic signatures can indicate the origin of material ejected into space. The Moon's titanium isotope ratio (50Ti/47Ti) appears close to the Earth's (within 4 ppm). In 2013, a study was released that indicated water in lunar magma was 'indistinguishable' from carbonaceous chondrites and nearly the same as Earth's, based on the composition of water isotopes.Earth-Moon: A Watery \\"Double-Planet\\" A. Saal, et al - Hydrogen Isotopes in Lunar Volcanic Glasses and Melt Inclusions Reveal a Carbonaceous Chondrite Heritage = Origins of life = Isotopic fingerprints typical of life, preserved in sediments, have been used to suggest that life existed on the planet already by 3.85 billion years ago.

The goal of this curriculum is to produce graduates who will be successful in their pursuit of higher education in specific subjects. The High School of Engineering and Science was a dream of its founder and principal Dr. Alvin Garblik. The first class began in 1979, and had a strict dress code and curriculum. Those that were in the first class attended classes in Stauffer Hall, a ten-story building no longer in existence, then located at the Southeast corner of Broad and Columbia streets on Temple University's campus. The school moved between the 82-83 and 83-84 school years to its current 17th and Norris location, which had previously been an elementary school. It was Dr. Garblik's belief that students should come to school dressed and act in a way that modeled real life in the business world. The first year students enjoyed higher end classes learning advanced Chinese, physics and computer sciences. \\"High School of Engineering and Science is a small, nurturing, special-admissions school, seeking to attract academically-talented students who have an interest in science, engineering and technology.\\" --- The mission statement of High School of Engineering & Science The School as of 2019, has also received 2 blue ribbon awards of excellence.

Weiser, 1996. 666-Stele of revealing- tag from Cairo Museum According to Aleister Crowley, his wife Rose had already reported a revelation from the god Horus, through his messenger Aiwass.Equinox 7:4-the events leading up to writing of the book The couple went to the newly opened Egyptian Museum (where the stela had been moved), to see if she could recognize Horus on Monday, March 21, 1904. Rose recognized an image of the god on this painted stele, which at the time bore the catalogue number 666, a number holding religious significance in Thelema. According to Crowley, the stela depicts the three chief deities of Thelema: Nuit (Egyptian Nut), Hadit (Egyptian Behdety), and Ra-Hoor-Khuit (Egyptian Re-Harakhty [\\"Re-Horus of the Two Horizons\\"]). Crowley states that he dined with the Egyptologist √âmile Charles Albert Brugsch bey, Curator of the Bulaq Museum to discuss the stele in his charge and to arrange for a facsimile to be made. According to Crowley, Brugsch's French assistant curator translated the hieroglyphic text on the stele.The Equinox of the Gods section 7:4-The people In 1912 a second translation was later made for Crowley by Alan Gardiner and Battiscombe Gunn.

Charlotte Helen Dolby was born in London to Samuel Dolby and Charlotte Niven. Her father died when she was 10 years old. She studied at the Royal Academy of Music from 1832 to 1837, Domenico Crivelli being her principal singing-master. In 1837 she was elected to a King's scholarship, and first appeared at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert in 1841. In October 1845 she sang at the Gewandhaus, Leipzig, through the influence of Mendelssohn, who had been delighted by her singing in his oratorio St. Paul. The contralto music in his Elijah was written for her voice, but she did not appear in that work until the performance at Exeter Hall on 16 April 1847. She was a principal soloist in the first English performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion, directed by William Sterndale Bennett at the Hanover Square Rooms London on 6 April 1854 and again for the premiere of his Sacred Cantata The Woman of Samaria at the Birmingham Musical Festival in 1867. She married the violinist Prosper Sainton in 1860, and in 1870 she retired from the career of a public singer, but two years afterwards started a vocal academy in London. She made various successful attempts as a composer, and the cantatas The Legend of St Dorothea (1876), The Story of the Faithful Soul (1879), and Florimel (1885), enjoyed considerable success. Her last public appearance was at her husband's farewell concert in June 1883, and she died in 1885. A scholarship in her memory was founded at the Royal Academy of Music. Her voice was of moderate power and of fine quality, but it was her dignified and artistic style that gave her the high place she held for so many years both in oratorio and ballads.

He is married to Mary Alicƒó Spears-Harrison and the father of Victoria Harrison. Biography The foundation of Harrison's music comes from his lifelong participation in New Orleans culture. He started in New Orleans secondline culture and studied New Orleans secret tribal culture under his father, Big Chief Donald Harrison Sr.. Harrison Jr. is currently the Chief of Congo Square in Afro-New Orleans Culture. He studied at the Berklee College of Music. As a professional musician he worked with Roy Haynes and Jack McDuff before joining Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers with Terence Blanchard and recorded albums in a quintet until 1989. Two years later Harrison released a tribute album to Blakey. This was followed by an album that reached into Harrison's New Orleans heritage with guest appearances by Dr. John and Cyrus Chestnut and chants by the Guardians of the Flame Mardi Gras Indians. He devoted half the album Nouveau Swing (1997) to mixing the swing beat of modern acoustic jazz with modern dance music and half to mixing the swing beat with Caribbean-influenced music. On the next album his experiments continued by mixing modern jazz's swing beat with hip hop, Latin music, R&B;, and smooth jazz. His albums, 3D Vols. I, II, and III, present him in three different musical genres. On Vol. I he writes, plays, and produces smooth jazz and R&B; style. On Vol. II he writes, produces and plays in the classic jazz style. On Vol. III he writes plays and produces hip hop. His group, Donald Harrison Electric Band, has recorded popular radio hits and has charted in the top ten of Billboard magazine. He performs as a producer, singer, and rapper in traditional New Orleans jazz and hip hop genres with his group, The New Sounds of Mardi Gras. The group, which has recorded two albums, was started in 2001 and has made appearances worldwide. Harrison is the Big Chief of the Congo Nation Afro-New Orleans Cultural Group, which keeps alive the secret traditions of Congo Square. In 2016 Harrison recorded his first orchestral work with The Moscow Symphony Orchestra. He followed up the piece for the MSO by writing classical orchestral works for the Thailand Philharmonic Orchestra, The New York Chamber Orchestra, and The Jalapa Symphony Orchestra in 2017. Harrison has nurtured a number of young musicians including trumpeter Christian Scott (Harrison's nephew), Mark Whitfield, Christian McBride, and The Notorious B.I.G. Harrison was in Spike Lee's HBO documentary When the Levees Broke and has appeared as himself in eleven episodes of the television series Treme. Harrison was chosen Person of the Year by Jazziz magazine in January 2007.

Motor control includes reflexes as well as directed movement. To control movement, the nervous system must integrate multimodal sensory information (both from the external world as well as proprioception) and elicit the necessary signals to recruit muscles to carry out a goal. This pathway spans many disciplines, including multisensory integration, signal processing, coordination, biomechanics, and cognition, and the computational challenges are often discussed under the term sensorimotor control. Successful motor control is crucial to interacting with the world to carry out goals as well as for posture, balance, and stability. Some researchers (mostly neuroscientists studying movement) argue that motor control is the reason brains exist at all.  Neural control of muscles  All movements, e.g. touching your nose, require motor neurons to fire action potentials that results in contraction of muscles. In humans, ~150,000 motor neurons control the contraction of ~600 muscles. To produce movements, a subset of 600 muscles must contract in a temporally precise pattern to produce the right force at the right time. = Motor units and force production = A single motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates are called a motor unit. For example, the rectus femoris contains approximately 1 million muscle fibers, which are controlled by around 1000 motor neurons. Activity in the motor neuron causes contraction in all of the innervated muscle fibers so that they function as a unit. Increases in action potential frequency (spike rate) in the motor neuron cause increases in muscle fiber contraction, up to the maximal force. The maximal force depends on the contractile properties of the muscle fibers. Within a motor unit, all the muscle fibers are of the same type (e.g. type I (slow twitch) or Type II fibers (fast twitch)), and motor units of multiple types make up a given muscle. Motor units of a given muscle are collectively referred to as a motor pool. The force produced in a given muscle thus depends on: 1) How many motor neurons are active, and their spike rates; 2) the contractile properties and number of muscle fibers innervated by the active neurons. To generate more force, increase the spike rates of active motor neurons and/or recruiting more and stronger motor units. = Recruitment order = Motor units within a motor pool are recruited in a stereotypical order, from motor units that produce small amounts of force per spike, to those producing the largest force per spike. The gradient of motor unit force is correlated with a gradient in motor neuron soma size and motor neuron electrical excitability. This relationship was described by Elwood Henneman and is known as Henneman's size principle, a fundamental discovery of neuroscience and an organizing principle of motor control. For tasks requiring small forces, such as continual adjustment of posture, motor units with fewer muscle fibers that are slowly-contracting but less fatigueable are used. As more force is required, motor units with fast twitch, fast-fatigeable muscle fibers are recruited. High  _ Force required  /        _ Low ‚Üë ‚Üë ‚Üë Time Type I Recruit first Type II A Type IIB  Computational issues of motor control  The nervous system produces movement by selecting which motor neurons are activated, and when. The finding that a recruitment order exists within a motor pool is thought to reflect a simplification of the problem: if a particular muscle should produce a particular force, then activate the motor pool along its recruitment hierarchy until that force is produced. But then how to choose what force to produce in each muscle? The nervous system faces the following issues in solving this problem. # Redundancy. Infinite trajectories of movements can accomplish a goal (e.g. touch my nose). How is a trajectory chosen? Which trajectory is best? # Noise. Noise is defined as small fluctuations that are unrelated to a signal, which can occur in neurons and synaptic connections at any point from sensation to muscle contraction. # Delays. Motor neuron activity precedes muscle contraction, which precedes the movement. Sensory signals also reflect events that have already occurred. Such delays affect the choice of motor program. # Uncertainty. Uncertainty arises because of neural noise, but also because inferences about the state of the world may not be correct (e.g. speed of on coming ball). # Nonstationarity. Even as a movement is being executed, the state of the world changes, even through such simple effects as reactive forces on the rest of the body, causing translation of a joint while it is actuated. # Nonlinearity. The effects of neural activity and muscle contraction are highly non-linear, which the nervous system must account for when predicting the consequences of a pattern of motor neuron activity. Much ongoing research is dedicated to investigating how the nervous system deals with these issues, both at the behavioral level, as well as how neural circuits in the brain and spinal cord represent and deal with these factors to produce the fluid movements we witness in animals. \\"Optimal feedback control\\" is an influential theoretical framing of these computation issues.  Sensorimotor feedback  =Response to stimuli= The process of becoming aware of a sensory stimulus and using that information to influence an action occurs in stages. Reaction time of simple tasks can be used to reveal information about these stages. Reaction time refers to the period of time between when the stimulus is presented, and the end of the response. Movement time is the time it takes to complete the movement. Some of the first reaction time experiments were carried out by Franciscus Donders, who used the difference in response times to a choice task to determine the length of time needed to process the stimuli and choose the correct response. While this approach is ultimately flawed, it gave rise to the idea that reaction time was made up of a stimulus identification, followed by a response selection, and ultimately culminates in carrying out the correct movement. Further research has provided evidence that these stages do exist, but that the response selection period of any reaction time increases as the number of available choices grows, a relationship known as Hick's law. =Closed loop control= The classical definition of a closed loop system for human movement comes from Jack A. Adams (1971).J.A. Adams. A closed loop theory of motor learning. In: Journal of Motor Behavior 3 (1971) p 116. This is also quoted in: Jack A. Adams, Issues for a Closed Loop Theory of Motor Learning. In: George E. Stelmach (Ed.) Motor Control, Issues and Trends. Academic press. New York 1976. p 89 A reference of the desired output is compared to the actual output via error detection mechanisms, using feedback, the error is corrected for. Most movements that are carried out during day-to- day activity are formed using a continual process of accessing sensory information and using it to more accurately continue the motion. This type of motor control is called feedback control, as it relies on sensory feedback to control movements. Feedback control is a situated form of motor control, relying on sensory information about performance and specific sensory input from the environment in which the movement is carried out. This sensory input, while processed, does not necessarily cause conscious awareness of the action. Closed loop controlRichard A. Schmidt: Motor control and Learning. Human Kinetics Publishers, Champaign, Illinois 1982, p 186 is a feedback based mechanism of motor control, where any act on the environment creates some sort of change that affects future performance through feedback. Closed loop motor control is best suited to continuously controlled actions, but does not work quickly enough for ballistic actions. Ballistic actions are actions that continue to the end without thinking about it, even when they no longer are appropriate. Because feedback control relies on sensory information, it is as slow as sensory processing. These movements are subject to a speed/accuracy trade-off, because sensory processing is being used to control the movement, the faster the movement is carried out, the less accurate it becomes. =Open loop control= The classical definition from Jack A. Adams is:J.A. Adams. A Cllosed Loop Theory of Motor Learning. In: Journal of Motor behavior 3 (1971) p 116. Also quoted in: Jack A. Adams, Issues for a Closed Loop Theory of Motor Learning. In: George E. Stelmach (Ed.) Motor Control, Issues and Trends. Academic press. New York 1976. p 89 ‚ÄúAn open loop system has no feedback or mechanisms for error regulation. The input events for a system exert their influence, the system effects its transformation on the input and the system has an output...... A traffic light with fixed timing snarls traffic when the load is heavy and impedes the flow when the traffic is light. The system has no compensatory capability.‚Äù Some movements, however, occur too quickly to integrate sensory information, and instead must rely on feed forward control. Open loop control is a feed forward form of motor control, and is used to control rapid, ballistic movements that end before any sensory information can be processed. To best study this type of control, most research focuses on deafferentation studies, often involving cats or monkeys whose sensory nerves have been disconnected from their spinal cords. Monkeys who lost all sensory information from their arms resumed normal behavior after recovering from the deafferentation procedure. Most skills were relearned, but fine motor control became very difficult. It has been shown that the open loop control can be adapted to different disease conditions and can therefore be used to extract signatures of different motor disorders by varying the cost functional governing the system. Coordination A core motor control issue is coordinating the various components of the motor system to act in unison to produce movement. The motor system is highly complex, composed of many interacting parts at many different organizational levels Peripheral neurons receive input from the central nervous system and innervate the muscles. In turn, muscles generate forces which actuate joints. Getting the pieces to work together is a challenging problem for the motor system and how this problem is resolved is an active area of study in motor control research. =Reflexes= In some cases the coordination of motor components is hard-wired, consisting of fixed neuromuscular pathways that are called reflexes. Reflexes are typically characterized as automatic and fixed motor responses, and they occur on a much faster time scale than what is possible for reactions that depend on perceptual processing. Reflexes play a fundamental role in stabilizing the motor system, providing almost immediate compensation for small perturbations and maintaining fixed execution patterns. Some reflex loops are routed solely through the spinal cord without receiving input from the brain, and thus do not require attention or conscious control. Others involve lower brain areas and can be influenced by prior instructions or intentions, but they remain independent of perceptual processing and online control. The simplest reflex is the monosynaptic reflex or short-loop reflex, such as the monosynaptic stretch response. In this example, Ia afferent neurons are activated by muscle spindles when they deform due to the stretching of the muscle. In the spinal cord, these afferent neurons synapse directly onto alpha motor neurons that regulate the contraction of the same muscle. Thus, any stretching of a muscle automatically signals a reflexive contraction of that muscle, without any central control. As the name and the description implies, monosynaptic reflexes depend on a single synaptic connection between an afferent sensory neuron and efferent motor neuron. In general the actions of monosynaptic reflexes are fixed and cannot be controlled or influenced by intention or instruction. However, there is some evidence to suggest that the gain or magnitude of these reflexes can be adjusted by context and experience. Polysynaptic reflexes or long-loop reflexes are reflex arcs which involve more than a single synaptic connection in the spinal cord. These loops may include cortical regions of the brain as well, and are thus slower than their monosynaptic counterparts due to the greater travel time. However, actions controlled by polysynaptic reflex loops are still faster than actions which require perceptual processing. While the actions of short-loop reflexes are fixed, polysynaptic reflexes can often be regulated by instruction or prior experience. A common example of a long loop reflex is the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex observed in infants. =Synergies= A motor synergy is a neural organization of a multi-element system that (1) organizes sharing of a task among a set of elemental variables; and (2) ensures co-variation among elemental variables with the purpose to stabilize performance variables. The components of a synergy need not be physically connected, but instead are connected by their response to perceptual information about the particular motor task being executed. Synergies are learned, rather than being hardwired like reflexes, and are organized in a task-dependent manner; a synergy is structured for a particular action and not determined generally for the components themselves. Nikolai Bernstein famously demonstrated synergies at work in the hammering actions of professional blacksmiths. The muscles of the arm controlling the movement of the hammer are informationally linked in such a way that errors and variability in one muscle are automatically compensated for by the actions of the other muscles. These compensatory actions are reflex-like in that they occur faster than perceptual processing would seem to allow, yet they are only present in expert performance, not in novices. In the case of blacksmiths, the synergy in question is organized specifically for hammering actions and is not a general purpose organization of the muscles of the arm. Synergies have two defining characteristics in addition to being task dependent; sharing and flexibility/stability. \\"Sharing\\" requires that the execution of a particular motor task depends on the combined actions of all the components that make up the synergy. Often, there are more components involved than are strictly needed for the particular task (see \\"Redundancy\\" below), but the control of that motor task is distributed across all components nonetheless. A simple demonstration comes from a two-finger force production task, where participants are required to generate a fixed amount of force by pushing down on two force plates with two different fingers. In this task, participants generated a particular force output by combining the contributions of independent fingers. While the force produced by any single finger can vary, this variation is constrained by the action of the other such that the desired force is always generated. Co-variation also provides \\"flexibility and stability\\" to motor tasks. Considering again the force production task, if one finger did not produce enough force, it could be compensated for by the other. The components of a motor synergy are expected to change their action to compensate for the errors and variability in other components that could affect the outcome of the motor task. This provides flexibility because it allows for multiple motor solutions to particular tasks, and it provides motor stability by preventing errors in individual motor components from affecting the task itself. Synergies simplify the computational difficulty of motor control. Coordinating the numerous degrees of freedom in the body is a challenging problem, both because of the tremendous complexity of the motor system, as well as the different levels at which this organization can occur (neural, muscular, kinematic, spatial, etc.). Because the components of a synergy are functionally coupled for a specific task, execution of motor tasks can be accomplished by activating the relevant synergy with a single neural signal. The need to control all of the relevant components independently is removed because organization emerges automatically as a consequence of the systematic covariation of components. Similar to how reflexes are physically connected and thus do not require control of individual components by the central nervous system, actions can be executed through synergies with minimal executive control because they are functionally connected. Beside motor synergies, the term of sensory synergies has recently been introduced. Sensory synergy are believed to play an important role in integrating the mixture of environmental inputs to provide low-dimensional information to the CNS thus guiding the recruitment of motor synergies. Synergies are fundamental for controlling complex movements, such as the ones of the hand during grasping.Their importance has been demonstrated for both muscle control and in the kinematic domain in several studies, lately on studies including large cohorts of subjects. The relevance of synergies for hand grasps is also enforced by studies on hand grasp taxonomies, showing muscular and kinematic similarities among specific groups of grasps, leading to specific clusters of movements. =Motor Programs= While synergies represent coordination derived from peripheral interactions of motor components, motor programs are specific, pre-structured motor activation patterns that are generated and executed by a central controller (in the case of a biological organism, the brain). They represent at top-down approach to motor coordination, rather than the bottom-up approach offered by synergies. Motor programs are executed in an open-loop manner, although sensory information is most likely used to sense the current state of the organism and determine the appropriate goals. However, once the program has been executed, it cannot be altered online by additional sensory information. Evidence for the existence of motor programs comes from studies of rapid movement execution and the difficulty associated with changing those movements once they have been initiated. For example, people who are asked to make fast arm swings have extreme difficulty in halting that movement when provided with a \\"STOP\\" signal after the movement has been initiated. This reversal difficulty persists even if the stop signal is presented after the initial \\"GO\\" signal but before the movement actually begins. This research suggests that once selection and execution of a motor program begins, it must run to completion before another action can be taken. This effect has been found even when the movement that is being executed by a particular motor program is prevented from occurring at all. People who attempt to execute particular movements (such as pushing with the arm), but unknowingly have the action of their body arrested before any movement can actually take place, show the same muscle activation patterns (including stabilizing and support activation that does not actually generate the movement) as when they are allowed to complete their intended action. Although the evidence for motor programs seems persuasive, there have been several important criticisms of the theory. The first is the problem of storage. If each movement an organism could generate requires its own motor program, it would seem necessary for that organism to possess an unlimited repository of such programs and where these would be kept is not clear. Aside from the enormous memory requirements such a facility would take, no motor program storage area in the brain has yet been identified. The second problem is concerned with novelty in movement. If a specific motor program is required for any particular movement, it is not clear how one would ever produce a novel movement. At best, an individual would have to practice any new movement before executing it with any success, and at worst, would be incapable of new movements because no motor program would exist for new movements. These difficulties have led to a more nuanced notion of motor programs known as generalized motor programs. A generalized motor program is a program for a particular class of action, rather than a specific movement. This program is parameterized by the context of the environment and the current state of the organism. =Redundancy= An important issue for coordinating the motor system is the problem of the redundancy of motor degrees of freedom. As detailed in the \\"Synergies\\" section, many actions and movements can be executed in multiple ways because functional synergies controlling those actions are able to co-vary without changing the outcome of the action. This is possible because there are more motor components involved in the production of actions than are generally required by the physical constraints on that action. For example, the human arm has seven joints which determine the position of the hand in the world. However, only three spatial dimensions are needed to specify any location the hand could be placed in. This excess of kinematic degrees of freedom means that there are multiple arm configurations that correspond to any particular location of the hand. Some of the earliest and most influential work on the study of motor redundancy came from the Russian physiologist Nikolai Bernstein. Bernstein's research was primarily concerned with understanding how coordination was developed for skilled actions. He observed that the redundancy of the motor system made it possible to execute actions and movements in a multitude of different ways while achieving equivalent outcomes. This equivalency in motor action means that there is no one-to-one correspondence between the desired movements and the coordination of the motor system needed to execute those movements. Any desired movement or action does not have a particular coordination of neurons, muscles, and kinematics that make it possible. This motor equivalency problem became known as the degrees of freedom problem because it is a product of having redundant degrees of freedom available in the motor system. Perception in Motor Control Related, yet distinct from the issue of how the processing of sensory information affects the control of movements and actions is the question of how the perception of the world structures action. Perception is extremely important in motor control because it carries the relevant information about objects, environments and bodies which is used in organizing and executing actions and movements. What is perceived and how the subsequent information is used to organize the motor system is a current and ongoing area of research. =Model Based Control Strategies= Most model based strategies of motor control rely on perceptual information, but assume that this information is not always useful, veridical or constant. Optical information is interrupted by eye blinks, motion is obstructed by objects in the environment, distortions can change the appearance of object shape. Model based and representational control strategies are those that rely on accurate internal models of the environment, constructed from a combination of perceptual information and prior knowledge, as the primary source information for planning and executing actions, even in the absence of perceptual information. Inference and Indirect Perception Many models of the perceptual system assume indirect perception, or the notion that the world that gets perceived is not identical to the actual environment. Environmental information must go through several stages before being perceived, and the transitions between these stages introduce ambiguity. What actually gets perceived is the mind's best guess about what is occurring in the environment based on previous experience. Support for this idea comes from the Ames room illusion, where a distorted room causes the viewer to see objects known to be a constant size as growing or shrinking as they move around the room. The room itself is seen as being square, or at least consisting of right angles, as all previous rooms the perceiver has encountered have had those properties. Another example of this ambiguity comes from the doctrine of specific nerve energies. The doctrine presents the finding that there are distinct nerve types for different types of sensory input, and these nerves respond in a characteristic way regardless of the method of stimulation. That is to say, the color red causes optical nerves to fire in a specific pattern that is processed by the brain as experiencing the color red. However, if that same nerve is electrically stimulated in an identical pattern, the brain could perceive the color red when no corresponding stimuli is present. Forward Models Forward models are a predictive internal model of motor control that takes the available perceptual information, combined with a particular motor program, and tries to predict the outcome of the planned motor movement. Forward models structure action by determining how the forces, velocities, and positions of motor components affect changes in the environment and in the individual. It is proposed that forward models help with the Neural control of limb stiffness when individuals interact with their environment. Forward models are thought to use motor programs as input to predict the outcome of an action. An error signal is generated when the predictions made by a forward model do not match the actual outcome of the movement, prompting an update of an existing model and providing a mechanism for learning. These models explain why it is impossible to tickle yourself. A sensation is experienced as ticklish when it is unpredictable. However, forward models predict the outcome of your motor movements, meaning the motion is predictable, and therefore not ticklish. Evidence for forward models comes from studies of motor adaptation. When a person's goal-directed reaching movements are perturbed by a force field, they gradually, but steadily, adapt the movement of their arm to allow them to again reach their goal. However, they do so in such a way that preserves some high level movement characteristics; bell-shaped velocity profiles, straight line translation of the hand, and smooth, continuous movements. These movement features are recovered, despite the fact that they require startlingly different arm dynamics (i.e. torques and forces). This recovery provides evidence that what is motivating movement is a particular motor plan, and the individual is using a forward model to predict how arm dynamics change the movement of the arm to achieve particular task level characteristics. Differences between the expected arm movement and the observed arm movement produces an error signal which is used as the basis for learning. Additional evidence for forward models comes from experiments which require subjects to determine the location of an effector following an unvisualized movement Inverse Models Inverse models predict the necessary movements of motor components to achieve a desired perceptual outcome. They can also take the outcome of a motion and attempt to determine the sequence of motor commands that resulted in that state. These types of models are particularly useful for open loop control, and allow for specific types of movements, such as fixating on a stationary object while the head is moving. Complementary to forward models, inverse models attempt to estimate how to achieve a particular perceptual outcome in order to generate the appropriate motor plan. Because inverse models and forward model are so closely associated, studies of internal models are often used as evidence for the roles of both model types in action. Motor adaptation studies, therefore, also make a case for inverse models. Motor movements seem to follow predefined \\"plans\\" that preserve certain invariant features of the movement. In the reaching task mentioned above, the persistence of bell-shaped velocity profiles and smooth, straight hand trajectories provides evidence for the existence of such plans. Movements that achieve these desired task-level outcomes are estimated by an inverse model. Adaptation therefore proceeds as a process of estimating the necessary movements with an inverse model, simulating with a forward model the outcome of those movement plans, observing the difference between the desired outcome and the actual outcome, and updating the models for a future attempt. =Information Based Control= An alternative to model based control is information based control. Informational control strategies organize movements and actions based on perceptual information about the environment, rather than on cognitive models or representations of the world. The actions of the motor system are organized by information about the environment and information about the current state of the agent. Information based control strategies often treat the environment and the organism as a single system, with action proceeding as a natural consequence of the interactions of this system. A core assumption of information based control strategies is that perceptions of the environment are rich in information and veridical for the purposes of producing actions. This runs counter to the assumptions of indirect perception made by model based control strategies. Direct Perception Direct perception in the cognitive sense is related to the philosophical notion of na√Øve or direct realism in that it is predicated on the assumption that what we perceive is what is actually in the world. James J. Gibson is credited with recasting direct perception as ecological perception. While the problem of indirect perception proposes that physical information about object in our environment is not available due to the ambiguity of sensory information, proponents of direct perception (like Gibson) suggest that the relevant information encoded in sensory signals is not the physical properties of objects, but rather the action opportunities the environment affords. These affordances are directly perceivable without ambiguity, and thus preclude the need for internal models or representations of the world. Affordances exist only as a byproduct of the interactions between an agent and its environment, and thus perception is an \\"ecological\\" endeavor, depending on the whole agent/environment system rather than on the agent in isolation. Because affordances are action possibilities, perception is directly connected to the production of actions and movements. The role of perception is to provide information that specifies how actions should be organized and controlled, and the motor system is \\"tuned\\" to respond to specific type of information in particular ways. Through this relationship, control of the motor system and the execution of actions is dictated by the information of the environment. As an example, a doorway \\"affords\\" passing through, but a wall does not. How a one might pass through a doorway is specified by the visual information received from the environment, as well as the information perceived about one's own body. Together, this information determines the pass-ability of a doorway, but not a wall. In addition, the act of moving towards and passing through the doorway generates more information and this in turn specifies further action. The conclusion of direct perception is that actions and perceptions are critically linked and one cannot be fully understood without the other. Behavioral Dynamics Building on the assumptions of direct perception behavioral dynamics is a behavioral control theory that treats perceptual organisms as dynamic systems that respond to informational variables with actions, in a functional manner. Under this understanding of behavior, actions unfold as the natural consequence of the interaction between the organisms and the available information about the environment, which specified in body-relevant variables. Much of the research in behavioral dynamics has focused on locomotion, where visually specified information (such as optic flow, time-to-contact, optical expansion, etc.) is used to determine how to navigate the environment Interaction forces between the human and the environment also affect behavioral dynamics as seen in by the Neural control of limb stiffness.

Besides a standard analog transmission, KALC broadcasts over two HD Radio channels, and is available online via Radio.com. History =KBPI years= On June 21, 1965, the station signed on as KBPI, airing a progressive rock music format.Broadcasting Yearbook 1966 page B-24 The owner and general manager of the station was Bill Pierson, who named KBPI for \\"Bill Pierson Incorporated.\\" The station was powered at 30,000 watts, a third of its current output. Pierson sold the station in 1974 to Sandusky Newspapers, Inc. (Radio Division), based in Ohio. Led by General Manager Toney Brooks and Program Director Frank Cody, the station adopted an album-oriented rock (AOR) format and created the slogan \\"KBPI Rocks the Rockies\\". The station was later owned by WEBN's general manager, Frank Wood Jr. under the corporate name Progressive Broadcasters Incorporated, later renamed Secret Communications.Broadcasting Yearbook 1975 page C-28 =Creating \\"Alice\\"= On April 20, 1994, at 6 p.m., Secret moved KBPI and its rock format to 106.7, in place of former competitor KAZY. KALC then came on the air as the first Modern AC station, playing the adult-leaning hits from the modern rock charts, and was branded as \\"Alice 106.\\"\\"Radio's KBPI to get new name, frequency\\", The Denver Post, March 2, 1994.\\"'Alice's' radio arrival leaves all parties wondering\\", The Denver Post, June 8, 1994. The format was created by Frank Wood Jr., Chuck Finney, and Gregg Cassidy, with Wood referring to the new format as \\"Warped AC.\\" The sound was a combination of modern AC hits and creative DJs and production. The original KALC airstaff in 1994 included Frosty Stillwell, Jamie White and Frank Kramer in mornings, Chris Davis in middays, and Alan Kabel in afternoons, along with Music Director Jim Lawson, Creative Production Director Kelly Michaels, and Program Director Gregg Cassidy. Other on-air staff members included Jackie Selby, Cha Cha, JoJo Turnbeaugh, Tuna, Steve Weed, Shannon Stone, Patsy, Ethan, Brody Scott, Chad Steele and Mike \\"The Real Deal\\" Neil. Alice's audio was developed by Chief Engineer Jeff Garrett, while Liz Young served as Marketing Director. Other stations around the U.S. also picked up the \\"Alice\\" name and format. KALC first used the temporary calls KAKL, which is now used on the K-Love station in Anchorage, Alaska. =Change in ownership= Chancellor Media acquired KALC in 1996, while Chancellor itself would be acquired by AM/FM in 1998. In 2000, after Clear Channel Communications merged with AM/FM, Clear Channel was required to spin off several stations and KALC was chosen. The station was sold to Salem Communications, which in turn, sold the station to Emmis Communications. Emmis sold KALC and then co-owned KXPK to Entercom for $88 million in 2002. KXPK was spun off to Entravision shortly after the sale. In 2003, the Alice format was modified by newly appointed Program Director BJ Harris (formerly Director of Top 40/CHR Programming for Clear Channel Communications and half of the \\"MJ and BJ Morning Show\\" based at WFLZ Tampa). KALC would subsequently rebrand as \\"Alice 105.9\\", with a new logo to accent the changes. =Personnel changes= In early 2004, The Alice Morning Show (Gregg Thunder, Bo Reynolds and Slacker) went through several changes, as Reynolds took a break from radio, and Shea Baker was hired to replace Reynolds and joined Gregg Thunder and Slacker in studio. In November, Gregg Thunder decided to move back home to his hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota, with co- host Slacker moving to afternoons and Reynolds rejoining Alice to create the \\"Slacker and Bo Afternoon Show\\". Program Director BJ Harris took over the morning show with Shea Baker and hired Howie Drummond from Cincinnati, Ohio as another one of his sidekicks. The show was still called the \\"Alice Morning Show\\", but sometimes referred to as \\"The BJ, Shea and Howie Morning Show\\". In early 2005, BJ stepped down as the program director of Alice. A short time later, a new Program Director (Charese Fruge of KMXB Las Vegas) was hired; Charese then hired midday talent Sam Hill to replace departing Kevin \\"Koz\\" Koske, who left for WTMX in Chicago. In addition, Davin Fesmire replaced night show host George McFly. The \\"Alice Morning Show\\" was ready for some changes too; in 2005, Shea Baker was replaced with Denver market veteran Jennifer Wilde. At that point, the show's name became \\"The BJ, Howie and Jennifer Morning Show.\\" The show was a hit with Denver listeners, often finishing top three among female listeners. In 2006, Bo Reynolds left the afternoon show, replaced by Alice veteran Steve Weed, creating the \\"Slacker and Steve Afternoon Show.\\" Dylan Sprague (formerly of WWWQ Atlanta) took over the programming of \\"Alice\\" in January 2008. In November of that year, morning co- host Jennifer Wilde declined a contract renewal and left the \\"BJ, Howie and Jennifer Morning Show.\\" In January 2009, Erica Cobb (formerly of the \\"Eddie and Jobo Show\\" on WBBM-FM Chicago) would replace Wilde, with the show's name changing to \\"The BJ, Howie and Erica Morning Show.\\" Erica was replaced by former Alice morning show host Jamie White in 2012, while Howie Drummond left the show in October 2012. =HD changes= On June 3, 2019, KALC-HD2 picked up the LGBTQ-oriented talk/dance format of \\"Channel Q\\".

Life before World War II  Coppi was born in Wedding, Berlin to a working class family. His parents were Robert and Frieda, who were members of the Communist Party of Germany. From 1929 to 1932, he attended the Schulfarm Scharfenberg, a progressive \\"school-farm\\" in Berlin's Tegel district. During this time became a member of the \\"Red Pathfinders\\" and the Communist Youth Association of Germany (KJVD). In 1932, Coppi was expelled from the Schulfarm after supporting some students who had watched Georg Wilhelm Pabst's banned Franco-German solidarity film Kameradschaft. He was transferred to the Berliner Lessing-Gymnasium. In the meantime, Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party had assumed power in Germany. Following the Reichstag fire in March 1933, for which the Nazis blamed communists, Coppi took his political views and activity underground. Within a year, however, he had been arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Oranienburg concentration camp for two months without trial. He was then imprisoned for one year for handing out illegal leaflets. After his release, Coppi found work as a lathe operator and made contact with old friends from the Schulfarm aiding victims of Nazi persecution. He continued to co-write leaflets warning of the consequences of Nazi warmongering.  World War II  At the outbreak of World War II in autumn 1939, Coppi was deemed unfit and unworthy to be a soldier. Instead, he joined Wilhelm Sch√ºrmann-Horster's resistance group and established contacts with the communist \\"Red Orchestra\\" resistance circle. He agreed to pass information about these groups' activities to the Soviet Union by radio. In 1941, Coppi married Hilde Rake and the couple continued to aid victims of persecution and illegally relay information to and from Soviet radio. The following year, Coppi was given care of a Soviet agent who had been parachuted into Germany; and, as the tide of the war turned against Nazi Germany, Coppi received papers calling him up as \\"suitable\\" for service in the Wehrmacht. Downfall On September 12, 1942, Coppi and his pregnant wife were arrested in Schrimm (now ≈örem, Poland). His parents, brother and mother-in-law were also arrested around this time. He was convicted by the Reichskriegsgericht and sentenced to death on December 19. Three days later, he was hanged along with fellow resistance members Arvid Harnack and Harro Schulze-Boysen at Pl√∂tzensee Prison in Berlin. Hilde gave birth to their son, Hans, on November 27, while detained at the Barnimstrasse Women's Prison in Berlin. She was executed less than a year later, on August 5, 1943.

History The Square is located on what once was a \\"500-foot deep grassy field that served no apparent purpose other than to make City Hall hard to reach.\\" The square was named after Lastman in a motion brought forth by Howard Moscoe at a city council meeting in April 1986. Architect Michael Kirkland felt the overuse of concrete made the square feel \\"chintzy\\"; he would have used granite had the budget allowed for it. The Square cost $5 million to build. The opening ceremony on June 16th was attended by 3500 people, flanked by a choir and a giant inflatable King Kong on a nearby rooftop. Lincoln Alexander and Alan Tonks were present at the ceremony. Finally, MP Alan Redway read a tribute from Brian Mulroney and 7000 balloons were released. Surrounded by Yonge Street on the east, the Toronto District School Board headquarters on the south, North York Civic Centre on the west, and to the north by the North York Central Library and North York Centre shopping/office/hotel complex (5150 Yonge Street), Mel Lastman Square was intended to be the heart of North York. With its sunken configuration and tree cover, activities can take place away from the busy traffic on Yonge Street. An artificial stream runs from a fountain under a large sign at Yonge Street down into a large concrete square. Planters, trees, shrubs and wooden benches surround the area. A large pond is located in the centre of the square that serves as a relaxing focal point in the summer and a skating rink in the winter. The square also features an outdoor theatre for a number of events, including Sunday Serenades jazz concerts each summer. Other events include RBC Run for the Kids, a farmer's market, cultural festivals, Canada Day festivities and numerous family events. The family of one of the victims of the Toronto van attack donated a piano in April 2019 to the square. It has been placed under a rotunda in Mel Lastman Square.

The Bonneville International country music station has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts. Its studios are located in Greenwood Village, and the transmitter is on Squaw Mountain in Idaho Springs. KYGO-FM is Colorado's secondary (LP-2) Emergency Alert System station. AM 850 KOA is the primary (LP-1) station. The radio station broadcasts in the HD Radio format. The HD2 subchannel broadcasts classic country music as \\"KYGO Legendary Country.\\" The HD3 subchannel simulcasts the Contemporary Christian format heard on KTLF in Colorado Springs.  History  =KFML-FM and KIMN- FM= The station signed on the air on December 1, 1953 as KFML- FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1956 page 96 It was owned by Everett A. Bancker, Jr. and was the FM counterpart to AM 1390 KFML (now KGNU). Because the AM station was a daytimer, listeners could continue to hear its programming after sunset on KFML-FM. Following the sale of the station to Jefferson-Pilot Broadcasting in 1974, the station took the KIMN-FM call sign. (The KIMN currently reside at 100.3 FM in Denver, though that station is owned by Kroenke Sports & Entertainment.) At first, KIMN-FM aired a softer album rock format while AM 950 KIMN (now KKSE) had a Top 40 format. KIMN-FM later started playing Top 40 music, similar to its AM sister station. In the 1970s, there were a couple of country & western AM stations in Denver, though the music was not heard on FM, even though country was making inroads on FM stations in other cities. =Switch to KYGO Country= On June 1, 1979, 98.5 switched its call letters to KYGO and later that year changed from contemporary hits to country music.Broadcasting Yearbook 1980 page C-34 Bob Call, previously with country- formatted WSOC-FM in Charlotte, North Carolina, supervised the change. When he started at WSOC-FM, he said he knew little about country music, but learned fast. In 2006, as part of Lincoln Financial Media's acquisition of Jefferson- Pilot (including the J-P media properties), KYGO became a Lincoln Financial Media station. On April 26, 1988, the station slightly changed its call letters to KYGO-FM. At the same time, AM 950 switched its call sign to KYGO, and began airing a classic country format, to be a companion to FM 98.5's more contemporary country sound. In 2007, KYGO-FM was named \\"Country Music Station of the Year\\" in a top 25 market by Radio & Records magazine. Other nominees included WUSN Chicago, WYCD Detroit, KEEY-FM Minneapolis, WXTU Philadelphia, and KSON-FM San Diego. =Change in ownership= On December 8, 2014, Entercom announced it would purchase Lincoln Financial Group's entire 15-station lineup (including KYGO) in a $106.5 million deal. It operated the outlets under a local marketing agreement (LMA). On December 22, 2014, Entercom confirmed it would retain KYGO and its country format.\\"Entercom Acquires Lincoln Financial Media\\" from Radio Insight (December 8, 2014) The FCC approved the deal on June 26, 2015.\\"FCC OKs Lincoln Financial-Entercom Deal\\" from All Access (June 26, 2015) However, on July 14, 2015, the Department of Justice ruled that Entercom had too many stations in the Denver market. Entercom decided to spin off KYGO, KOSI, KKFN and KEPN to Bonneville International in exchange for Bonneville's Los Angeles station KSWD (now KKLQ) to meet ownership limits. Both Bonneville and Entercom began operating their new clusters via Time Brokerage Agreements on July 17, 2015. The transaction was consummated on November 24, 2015. = Taylor Swift incident = KYGO hired David Mueller as a DJ in January 2013. Mueller co-hosted the Ryno and Jackson morning show. On June 2, 2013, Mueller attended a meet-and-greet event before a Taylor Swift concert at the Pepsi Center. While having her photograph taken with Mueller, Swift alleged that he reached under her skirt and groped her. Though Mueller denied touching Swift inappropriately, KYGO-FM General Manager Robert Call fired him on June 4. Mueller sued Swift in September 2015 for loss of income, alleging that her allegation had led to his wrongful termination. Swift sued Mueller the next month. A civil trial began August 7, 2017. A jury found Mueller liable for assault and battery and awarded Swift one dollar, the amount she had sought.

This trail takes riders over a landscape of petrified sand dunes and the eroded remnants of ancient sea beds. Mountain bikers rate the Slickrock Trail as one of the more difficult rides in the Moab area, both technically and cardiovascularly. Description One of several steep hills on the Slickrock Trail, October 2005 Part of the Sand Flats Recreation Area (which is managed through a partnership between Grand County and the Bureau of Land Management), the Slickrock Trail was originally laid out in 1969 by Richard R. Wilson for use by Honda Trail 90s (before the mountain bike was invented), and the area is still open to such recreation today. 4X4 and off-road enthusiasts will find a challenge on the nearby Hell's Revenge 4X4 Trail, which intersects the Slickrock Trail in several places. The so-called \\"slickrock\\" sandstone, which forms the majority of the trail's surface has a surface much like sandpaper, making it really grippable by the rubber tires of a mountain bike or off-road motorcycle. The texture is notorious for inflicting severe abrasion injuries. The name \\"slickrock\\" was used by early settlers of the area to describe the sandstone because of the low traction between horses' metal shoes and the rock's sloping surfaces. The same is true today for cyclists who use shoes with metal cleats while riding the Slickrock Trail. Slickrock also becomes slick when wet. La Sal Mountain Range as seen from Slickrock Trail, April 2005 In geological terms, the Slickrock Trail is not part of the Entrada Sandstone formation, which includes the Slick Rock Member. Rather, most of the outcrop that forms the trail is Navajo Sandstone, and the term \\"slickrock\\" has come to mean any expanse of sandstone with a surface level enough for walking or riding. A small fee is required to enter the Sand Flats Recreation Area. Pit-toilets are available at the trailhead, but there is no drinking water available within the area. Permitted trail activities include mountain biking, hiking, and motorcycling. All four-wheeled vehicles are prohibited on the all of the Slickrock Trail, except those sections which intersect with the Hell's Revenge 4X4 Trail (which occurs about six time). Course The Slickrock Trail consists of three main sections: An out-and-back lead-in (akin to the stick of a lollipop or stem of a cherry), the main loop (akin to the fruit of a cherry or the candy part of a lollipop), and an optional practice trail (also called the practice loop, although it is not literally a loop) that begins and ends at separate points on the lead-in. The practice loop is about as hard as the rest of the trail, but it is shorter and close to the trailhead, serving for new riders as a sample of the rest of the trail or as an alternative return and or departure route. The lead-in, main loop, and practice trail are marked out by white, dashed lines on the rock to prevent riders from straying from the trail, becoming lost, or disturbing the fragile cryptobiotic soil near which the trail passes. Trail maintainers also use yellow markings near blind drop-offs, narrow ledges, and other features to indicate to riders where to be particularly careful.

The Court held that the police are not permitted to enter into someone's house without a search warrant. Background On the morning of June 8, 1991, 85-year-old Frank Boyle was found dead in his Likely, British Columbia home from several severe blows to the head with a crowbar. At the scene, the police found a Sportsman brand cigarette, and later found Mr. Boyle's truck abandoned in a ditch. On a tip from local residents, the police located the driver of the truck, Michael Feeney, sleeping in a trailer behind the residence of a friend of his. The police knocked on the trailer door, and shouted \\"police\\", but there was no reply. Guns drawn, the police entered. They found Feeney in bed and shook his leg to get his attention. The police asked him to get up and go outside where the light was better. Upon getting Mr. Feeney outside the police noticed his clothes were covered in blood. They read him his rights, he acknowledged he understood them, and they arrested him. Upon questioning him, Mr. Feeney said that the blood was from getting hit by a baseball the day before. The police further noted the same brand of cigarettes in the Trailer as was found in Mr. Boyle's house. He was taken to an RCMP detachment, finger printed, made to use a breathalyzer, and for the first day or so was unsuccessful in contacting a lawyer. During this time he was questioned further, admitting he had hit and robbed Boyle. Once a search warrant was obtained, the police found Boyle's stolen property in the trailer. It was only after all of this that he finally met with a lawyer. At trial in the Supreme Court of British Columbia he was convicted of second degree murder. Reasons of the court The majority was written by Sopinka J, La Forest, Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ concurring. =Section 8 of the Charter= Sopinka first considered the leading case of R. v. Landry [1986] on warrantless arrests in a dwelling, which held that a police officer could only arrest if there are \\"reasonable and probable grounds\\" to believe that the person is on the premises, the proper announcement is made before entering, and that the officer reasonably believes that the person has committed or will commit an indictable offence. \\"Reasonable and probable grounds\\" must be found on subjective and objective grounds (R. v. Storrey [1990]), however, Sopinka held that there were no such grounds in this situation. The officer had admitted that he didn't think he had proper ground to enter at the time. He then went one step further and held that R. v. Landry is bad law in post-Charter law and that any entry into dwellings must be done with a warrant. http://csc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1986/1986scr1-145/1986scr1-145.pdf =Section 24(2) of the Charter= Exclusionary rules of evidence based on section 8 violations of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. A voire dire is held by the trial judge to review the evidence in question before it is presented to the court or jury. This helps to ensure that any evidence brought before the courts has been legally seized by the police and that it does not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

At a height of , it is the tenth-tallest \\"traditional lighthouse\\" in the world. The Tour de Cordouan, the 'Patriarch of Lighthouses', is by far the oldest lighthouse in France. It was designed by leading Paris architect , and is something of a Renaissance masterpiece, an amalgam of royal palace, cathedral and fort. Started in 1584 and finished in 1611, it still stands today. History Small beacon towers had existed on the islet since 880, but the first proper structure was implemented by Edward, the Black Prince, as Guienne was then an English province. It was high, with a platform on top where a wood fire could be kept burning, and manned by a religious hermit. Passing ships paid two groats to pass - the first known instance of lighthouse dues. In addition to the tower, a small chapel was built on the islet. By the second half of the 16th century the tower had fallen into disrepair and the hazard to navigation threatened the Bordeaux wine trade. This led to the construction of the current Tour de Cordouan. Design Engraving of a drawing by Claude Chastillon of the original tower finished in 1611 De Foix first built a round base in diameter and high to take the onslaught of the waves. Within it was a cavity for storing water and other supplies. Above it were constructed four storeys of diminishing size. The ground floor consisted of a circular tower in diameter, with apartments for four keepers around its inner wall. In the centre was a richly decorated entrance hall and high. The second storey was the King's Apartment, consisting of a drawing room, anteroom and a number of closets. The third storey was a chapel with a domed roof notable for the beauty of its mosaic. Above this was secondary lantern, and above that the Lantern itself. This was above the sea and visible 5‚Äì6 miles away, the original light being provided by burning oak chips in a metal container. Throughout the building, de Foix took as much trouble with the decor as with the durability of the building, and on every floor was a profusion of gilt, carved work, elegantly arched doorways and statuary. Architectural drawing of the Cordouan lighthouse as extended in 1790. Extension The first parabolic lamps were added in 1782, but the lighthouse at the time was in very poor condition. Sailors also criticized the lack of height of the light. Major renovations were needed. They were carried out from 1782 to 1789 by the engineer Joseph Teul√®re who suggested enhancing the 30-metre tower, retaining the ground floor and two floors, in the Louis XVI style, the simplicity of which contrasted with the wealth of the lower floors, which retained their Renaissance decoration. In 1790, after the lighthouse was raised 60 meters above the highest tides, Teul√®re devised the first turning lighting dish. It consisted of Argand lamps turned by a machine built by a watchmaker in Dieppe. The fuel was a mixture of whale, olive and rapeseed oil. The first Fresnel lens rotating system, the invention of Augustin-Jean Fresnel, was installed in Cordouan in 1823. Three concentric lamp wicks, supplied with rapeseed oil by means of a suction and force pump, were placed in the focal plane of the apparatus. It was restored in 1855 and made a historical monument in 1862, at the same time as Notre-Dame de Paris. The original Fresnel lens was replaced by the present lens in 1854. The light was converted to petroleum gas in 1907 and to electricity in 1948, when a 6,000W lamp was used. The lamp was replaced by a 450W xenon lamp in 1984 but this was not successful and a halogen lamp was installed three years later. It was fully automated in 2006, although lighthouse keepers are still employed. Indeed, unlike in other lighthouses, maintaining continued keeping in Cordouan was deemed necessary to preserve this especially old and historic lighthouse, as well as to show visitors around. The last two State-formed, \\"traditional\\" keepers left in 2012 and were replaced by members of SMIDDEST, a local association. Cordouan is therefore the last inhabited lighthouse in France since the Cap Fr√©hel lighthouse saw its last keeper depart in August 2019.

The venture was successful, and the brothers, who had been interested spectators of the equestrian performances at Astley's Amphitheatre, London, then started touring the country with a circus entertainment consisting of a horse and pony and three or four human performers. This enterprise was a success from the beginning, and in due course John and George Sanger became lessees of the Agricultural Hall, London, and there produced a large number of elaborate spectacles. In 1871 the Sangers leased Astley's Amphitheatre where they gave an equestrian pantomime every winter, touring in the summer with a large circus. Subsequently the partnership was dissolved, each brother producing his own show. John Sanger died while touring, at Ipswich, the business being continued by his son. John Sanger's great-granddaughter, Victoria Sanger Freeman became a legendary figure in the circus world in her own right, becoming known as \\"the Queen of the Elephants.\\" She was the last of the great Sanger circus dynasty which proudly held the title \\"The Greatest Name in Circus.\\" The grave of John Sanger in Margate Cemetery, Kent Cultural references Sanger's circus once featured William Kite, an all-around performer whose appearance, as announced on a poster for Pablo Fanque's Circus Royal, was the inspiration for The Beatles song Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!Two Centuries of British Circus People Discussion,(2007) Retrieved 2011-04-09.

He was the first from the Florida Territory and the first Hispanic American to serve in the United States Congress. A member of the Whig Party, he served from September 1822 to March 1823. Jos√© Mariano Hern√°ndez was born in St. Augustine, Florida during Florida's second Spanish period. His parents were Minorcans who had originally come to the region as indentured servants in Andrew Turnbull's New Smyrna colony. Prior to the American acquisition of Florida, Hern√°ndez owned three plantations south of St. Augustine (in what was then East Florida): San Jose, Mala Compra, and Bella Vista, the last of which is now Washington Oaks State Gardens. He married the widowed Ana Mar√≠a Hill Williams on February 25, 1814 in St. Augustine. Ana Mar√≠a Hill was born on June 6, 1787 in St. Augustine, and was the daughter of the South Carolinian merchant Theophilus Hill, and his wife Theresa Thomas. The Hills had immigrated from South Carolina by the 1780s, Hern√°ndez and his wife had at least one child, Dora Hern√°ndez. and several daughters of the family married into the S√°nchez de Ortigosa family. When Spain ceded the Floridas to the United States in the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty in 1819, Hern√°ndez pledged his allegiance to the U.S. After the organization of the Florida Territory, he was elected Florida's first to the United States House of Representatives, and was approved by President James Monroe on September 30, 1822. He thus became the first Hispanic ever to serve in the U.S. Congress. He served for six months, leaving office on March 3, 1823. Hern√°ndez later served in the Territorial House of Representatives, the predecessor to the Florida House of Representatives, in which he was the presiding officer. He continued running his plantations, which were burned by the Seminoles in the Second Seminole War. The ruins of one of these plantations, Mala Compra, is today a preserved archaeological site. He was appointed Brigadier General over a troop of volunteers during the war and was subsequently commissioned in the United States Army, serving from 1835 to 1838. Hern√°ndez was the commanding officer responsible for the imprisonment of the Seminole leader Osceola upon the orders of General Thomas Jesup, as well as the capture of Seminole chiefs Ee- mat-la (King Philip) and Seminole ally Uchee Billy. He retired with the rank of Brigadier General. Hern√°ndez was an unsuccessful Whig candidate for the United States Senate in 1845. He later moved to Cuba and engaged as a planter in the District of Coliseo, near Matanzas, and died at the family's sugar estate, \\"Audaz\\", in the District of Coliseo, in Matanzas Province. He is interred in the Del Junco family vault in Necropolis San Carlos Borromeo, Matanzas.  Hern√°ndez‚ÄìCapron Trail  In 1837, while with the U.S. Army, Hern√°ndez was ordered to build a road between St. Augustine, Florida and Fort Capron, located near present-day Fort Pierce, Florida, on the St. Lucie River. He directed the blazing and clearing of the route that, 12 years earlier, Col. James Gadsden had cleared along the Atlantic Coastal Ridge to the St. Lucie River. It passed from Fort Capron through Fort Vinton, Fort Drum, Fort Kissimmee, Fort Meade to Fort Brooke (Tampa).

The building was built in 1958 by the firm Shore and Moffathttp://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/2004/agendas/committees/tw/tw041012/it013.pdf to replace the single storey brick Township of Etobicoke Municipal Hall at 4946 Dundas Street (now Fox and a Fiddle pub). The building exterior is clad in Queenston limestone and framed by glass and aluminum. The original building also features a clock tower with a non-numeric clock face. A limestone cenotaph (War Memorial - Etobicoke Municipal Centre) was constructed in 1968 in memory of those who gave their lives in World War I (1914 - 1918), World War II (1939 - 1945), and the Korean War (1950 - 1953). The original plan was to convert the clock tower as a cenotaph. The war dates are located on a metal plaque and above it a large metal cross. Adjacent to the Cenotaph, a provincial plaque commemorating Corporal Frederick George Topham, V.C., an Etobicoke war Hero was erected in 1980. The Board of Education (1 City Centre Court) and Ontario Hydro (South Block) built structures next to the Civic Centre, the former was acquired by Etobicoke for civic use in 1969. In 1973 an addition was added to the original by the same architectural firm. Etobicoke was amalgamated into the City of Toronto in 1998, and the building no longer serves as a city hall and retained for use for City of Toronto use. Located on The West Mall in central Etobicoke, the building is used as a meeting place for the Etobicoke community council a committee of councillors representing wards in the area that makes recommendations on local matters to the full city council. The building also houses a number of local municipal departments and services. A farmers' market operates from spring to fall yearly.

Armstrong, who would later become a Republican Congressman and two term U.S. Senator. Armstrong sold KOSI-AM-FM to Westinghouse Broadcasting in 1981. KOSI 1430 became KEZW in March of that year, carrying an adult standards format, while KOSI-FM continued playing easy listening music. =Move to Adult Contemporary= In 1988, Westinghouse sold KOSI and KEZW to D&D; Broadcasting, Inc. for $15.5 million.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC- IDX/88-OCR/BC-1988-11-14-OCR-Page-0102.pdf#search=%22kosi westinghouse%22 In the 1980s, many easy listening stations found their audiences getting older, and not as attractive to advertisers.

He worked on the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. for 61 years, first as a page boy and later as a clerk of the United States House of Representatives. He was the author of American Creed. Early life Page was born in 1868 in Frederick, Frederick County, Maryland. He was the great-great- grandson of Carter Braxton, (1736‚Äì1797), a member of the House of Burgesses of the Province of Virginia. He was also a descendant of President John Tyler. Page began working \\"twelve hours a day in a printing shop and a paper-bag factory\\" at the age of 10. Career Page began working as a page boy for the United States House of Representatives in Washington, D.C. on December 19, 1881, and he became a clerk in 1919. Page worked for the Capitol for 61 years in total. In 1917, at 49, Page wrote \\"The American's Creed,\\" as a submission to a nationwide patriotic contest suggested by Henry Sterling Chapin, of New York, which was inspired by a fervor at the beginning of the American entry into the First World War. The goal was to have a concise but complete statement of American political faith. Inspired by thoughts on his way home from church in May 1917, having just recited the Apostles' Creed used in most Christian churches as a statement of belief, Page drew on a wide variety of historical documents and speeches, including the Declaration of Independence, the Preamble to the US Constitution, Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, a speech made by Daniel Webster, and text from Edward Everett Hale's 1863 patriotic short story of a military officer condemned to exile, \\"The Man Without a Country.\\" He proceeded to craft a simple but moving expression of American patriotism. His submission was chosen in March 1918 over more than 3000 other entries. On April 3, 1918, it was accepted by the House Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and the US Commissioner of Education (then part of the US Department of the Interior) on behalf of the American people, according to the \\"Congressional Record\\", No. 102, April 13, 1918. A prize of $1000 was also awarded by Mayor James H. Preston on behalf of the City of Baltimore, which was the birthplace of the National Anthem. Page used it to purchase Liberty Bonds for the war effort and donated them to his church. Today, it also often comprises part of the naturalization ceremony to swear in new American citizens, along with other patriotic symbols, such as the Pledge of Allegiance to the American flag and the singing of various songs and anthems. =Clerk of House of Representatives= In 1919, the year after the war ended, Page was elected Clerk of the House of Representatives from the 66th United States Congress to the 71st Congress ended in 1931. The majority in power in the 1920s was the Republican Party. Later, he was Emeritus Minority Clerk, for the remainder of his life. He was highly respected by members of both major parties throughout his service, as a principled gentleman whose patriotism was inspirational and whose love of America was unquestioned. frame Page died 11 years later, during the first year of America's involvement in the Second World War, on October 19, 1942, after serving his country his entire adult life humbly but always proudly. The House of Representatives adjourned the following day in his honor. For many years, Page had also served as the President General of the United States Flag Association. The night before his death, he gave an address to the women's lineage society, the Daughters of the American Revolution on the Golden (50th) Anniversary of the writing of the Pledge of Allegiance to the American Flag (1892). =American's Creed= The American's Creed is as follows: > I believe in the United States of America as a government of the people, by > the people, for the people; whose just powers are derived from the consent > of the governed; a democracy in a republic; a sovereign Nation of many > sovereign States; a perfect union, one and inseparable; established upon > those principles of freedom, equality, justice, and humanity for which > American patriots sacrificed their lives and fortunes. I therefore believe > it is my duty to my country to love it, to support its Constitution, to obey > its laws, to respect its flag, and to defend it against all enemies. The American's Creed, original text handwritten by Page. Page once said: > The American's Creed is a summing up, in one hundred words, of the basic > principles of American political faith. It is not an expression of > individual opinion upon the obligations and duties of American citizenship > or with respect to its rights and privileges. It is a summary of the > fundamental principles of American political faith as set forth in its > greatest documents, its worthiest traditions and by its greatest leaders. Personal life, death and legacy Page resided in Friendship Heights, Maryland (in Montgomery County). He died of heart disease on October 19, 1942 in Washington, D.C., at age 74.

Popular among the students of McMaster Engineering, The Plumbline is famous for publishing everything from obscene sexual innuendos to informative articles. The Plumbline was started by a group of Engineering students in 1967, developed from a single sheet MES news letter. In 1971, the editors decided to turn the newsletter into an 8-page tabloid format newspaper. By the early 1990s, it was clear that student and administration acceptance of sexist and xenophobic content was reduced. In this climate, The Plumbline reformatted, dropping the drooping penis from its masthead, developing the satirical and parody genres of humor and abandoning misogyny as fodder for comedy. In October 2012, The Plumbline converted to a digital format, due to declining readerships and large print costs . Some in the McMaster Engineering community feel that the Plumbline is unfairly targeted by the remainder of the campus for its controversial content and potentially offensive subject matter, and that it is subjected to a harsher, more restrictive standard than other on-campus events (such as the misogynistic lyrics of Choclair who performed on campus) and publications organized by other groups (like the campus wide newspaper The Silhouette). Although The Plumbline is a publication of the MES, the material contained within it is not in any way affiliated with McMaster University, and does not express views or opinions shared by all, if any, students at the University. Origins Larry Ireland was the first Editor-in-Chief of The Plumbline (section), which got its name in an MES contest in the spring of 1967. Previously the MES newsletter was a one-page bi-monthly publication, which became the first Plumbline issue in April 1967 (volume 4 Nos 1 to 12). Don Mros created the cartoon character of SUPERPLUMBER, who battled 'artsies' and other 'low-lifes'. With help of Dean Hodgins office staff, the Plumbline put out a 4-page bi-weekly paper, which started with circulation of roughly 400 copies but grew to more than a thousand (total enrolment in all years & grads of Engineering = less than 700). The Plumbline became the most widely read newsletter on campus, especially in the women's residences. Limited by the technology of the day, the first issues used mimeograph and gestner printing. Content *Engitorials: Similar to a regular editorial, written by the Plumbline editor(s). *Shines and Moon: A thumbs up, thumbs down section where events and/or people are given approval or disapproval. *Shindigs and Hoedowns: A report or review of current events within the Engineering Society. *Onions and Opinions: A section similar to regular newspapers where readers can submit opinions and complaints. *News Briefs: Humorous news clips, most often fictional and absurd. *Nuts and Bolt: Various games and activities such as crosswords and connect-the-dots. *Plumboscopes: A humorous horoscope written by a Plumbline 'astrologer'. *Arts Matter: A section devoted to numerous comic strips, including those drawn by contributors. *Shafts and Gears: Page containing 'nerdy' or 'sick' jokes, usually inappropriate and/or technically obscure. The Plumbline also contains featured articles, usually pertaining to current events around McMaster and Engineering, as well as pictures and clips submitted by readers. The Plumbline is heavily dependent on reader-submitted content. Controversy In late 2005, publication of The Plumbline was temporarily suspended because of allegations from the McMaster Coalition for Equitable Social Change that the paper promoted hate-speech and sexist attitudes. The Coalition saw the newspaper as a key element in a larger problem of intolerance within the faculty of Engineering. They argued that this is evident in many of the faculty's traditions and \\"welcome\\" practices for first year students. According to them, the newspaper legitimized this culture of intolerance. On the other hand, advocates of The Plumbline argued that the depictions were wholly satirical in nature and protected under free speech. Some argue that the opposition was a form of moral panic in response to the rape of a McMaster student within the Engineering faculty and the efforts to minimize the rape and subsequent conviction of Engineering student for the crime. After a brief period of debates and arguments including review by the Executive of the McMaster Engineering Society, the Dean of Engineering, and the Human Rights Office, The Plumbline returned to shelves. There were a number of changes suggested to the content and a series of sensitivity training sessions took effect. Currently both online and hard-copy versions of the newspaper are available.

Bagley (DD-386) was laid down on 31 July 1935 at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia; launched on 3 September 1936; sponsored by Miss Bella Worth Bagley, sister of Ensign Bagley; and commissioned on 12 June 1937, Lieutenant Commander Earl W. Morris in command. Service history =Inter-War Period= Bagley worked extensively in the Atlantic before being sent to Pearl Harbor in 1940. She rotated occasionally between there and the Californian coast. By December 1941, Bagley was operating locally out of Pearl Harbor. Frequent exercises with DesDiv 7 were interspersed with carrier task force evolutions centered around and . The pace of these operations intensified as American economic sanctions, instituted in response to Japanese actions in China and French Indochina, provoked Japanese protests. On 3 December during an antiaircraft practice at sea with DesDiv 8, Bagleys starboard side bilge keel tore loose. The destroyer slowed to and changed course for Oahu, mooring at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard the following morning. On 6 December, the warship shifted berths starboard side to berth B-22 in Southeast Loch. By this time, Bagley had gone cold iron, receiving electricity, steam, and fresh water from the dock. =World War II= Pearl Harbor At 0755 on 7 December, shortly before morning colors, Japanese aircraft from six fleet carriers struck the Pacific Fleet as it lay in port at Pearl Harbor. Onboard Bagley, Radio Seaman Recruit Robert P. Coles from Machias, Maine exited the port side mess decks and saw the Japanese planes attacking Hickam Field. Realizing it was not fleet maneuvers he broke open the 50 caliber forward port ready service locker and opened fire and hit the first two Torpedo Bombers attacking Battleship Row. He was relieved by Chief Gunners Mate Skinner who, as noted in official records, fired at the third plane to attack. The crew first saw dive bombers in action over nearby Hickam Field and then witnessed a Nakajima B5N \\"Kate\\" torpedo planes pass down Southeast Loch and torpedo moored off Ford Island. The destroyer immediately went to general quarters, firing her .50-caliber machine guns at the torpedo- carrying Nakajimas passing down the port side to attack the American battleships. Shortly after 0800, a second \\"Kate\\"'s torpedo exploded in the bank about thirty feet ahead of Bagley. During the second phase of the attack, which began about 0840, Bagleys crew fired on Aichi D3A \\"Val\\" dive bombers attacking Ford Island and the navy yard dry docks. Her gunners claimed to have splashed at least six aircraft that morning; but, given the intensity of antiaircraft fire from all ships, her \\"kills\\" cannot be conclusively proven. At 0940, the warship headed for the channel and the open sea, leaving her commanding officer, executive officer, and gunnery officer ashore. Bagley, under the temporary command of Lieutenant Philip W. Cann, paused only long enough to pick up the skipper of destroyer , who was subsequently transferred to his own ship at sea. 1942 Bagley covered the arrival of TF 14 at Pearl Harbor four days after Christmas. The next day, the destroyer sailed with to patrol west of Oahu, covering the islands while two carrier groups escorted reinforcements to Samoa. On 11 January 1942, however, a single torpedo from hit and damaged the aircraft carrier. Bagley returned to Pearl Harbor with the injured Saratoga and, taking advantage of the opportunity, underwent a restricted availability at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard between 23 January and 3 February, adding four 20-millimeter machine guns to her antiaircraft battery. Departing Oahu on the last day of January, Bagley joined TF 11, comprising Lexington, four cruisers and nine destroyers, to cover transports delivering reinforcements to Christmas Island, Canton Island in the Phoenix Islands, and New Caledonia. Worried about Japanese intentions in the Fiji-New Caledonia area, TF 11 joined the ANZAC cruiser force, , , HMNZS Leander with and two destroyers, on 16 February. Shortly thereafter, the task force turned to the northwest and headed for Bougainville in the Solomon Islands. On 20 February, at 1707, the destroyer opened fire on a second wave of nine bombers with her 20-millimeter battery, joining the barrage of antiaircraft fire around Lexington. Minutes after that, one bomber attempted to crash Bagley's stern, but fire from helped splash the \\"Betty\\" some distant on the starboard quarter. Upkeep and repair, punctuated by a dry dock period, kept the destroyer's crew busy for the next month. Bagley took departure from Pearl Harbor on 30 April, carrying mail and passengers to Palmyra Island, Christmas Island, and the Society Islands. Off Bora Bora on 9 May, she rendezvoused with and escorted her to the Fiji Islands, arriving at Nukualofa Bay, Tongatapu, on 15 May. The destroyer then spent a week patrolling outside the harbor, protecting departing convoys from enemy submarines, before continuing on alone to Brisbane, Australia, arriving there on 30 May. Assigned to the Southwest Pacific Force (TF 44), Bagley protected convoys in the approaches to Australia, searched for submarine contacts during two patrol sweeps with , and conducted night battle practice and other exercises with the cruisers of TF 44 through mid-July. On the 17th, she departed Brisbane for New Zealand, arriving in Auckland on 20 July. There, she joined TF 62 and began preparations for Operation Watchtower, the invasion of Guadalcanal. Bagley steamed to the Fiji Islands, in company with cruisers Chicago, , Australia, , , eight other destroyers, and 12 transports. Joined by other convoy elements on the 26th, including three more cargo ships, Bagley guarded the transports as they conducted rehearsal landings at Koro Island. The task force then proceeded to the Solomon Islands, arriving in the transport area off Lunga Point, Guadalcanal, on 7 August. Assigned to \\"Southern Force\\", one of three picket patrols, Bagley and Patterson accompanied Australia, Canberra, and Chicago in protecting the transports south of Tulagi. Australia, with Rear Admiral Victor Alexander Charles Crutchley, RN, on board, left formation for a command conference at Lunga Roads at 2130. Just over two hours later, with visibility low owing to overcast sky and rain showers, unidentified ships loomed into view about distant on the port bow. These were seven Japanese cruisers and a destroyer under Rear Admiral Gunichi Mikawa sent from Rabaul to attack the American transports. At that moment, 0144 according to Bagleys log, float planes from the Japanese cruisers dropped flares that lit up the American warships. Bagley turned sharply to the left to bring the starboard torpedo tubes to bear on the Japanese warships looming out of the darkness but, either due to the torpedoes not being armed in time or because the ship turned too quickly for the torpedo tubes to be aimed properly,Loxton, Shame of Savo, p. 192. she continued her turn and fired four torpedoes to the northwest from number two port mount. Although the torpedomen claimed hits a few minutes later, no Japanese ships were damaged by torpedoes in that area. It is possible, but unconfirmed, that one or two of Bagley's torpedoes may have hit Canberra on her starboard side.Loxton, Shame of Savo, p. 191‚Äì205. Loxton presents a comprehensive case for why he believes Bagley took out Canberra with torpedoes. See Battle of Savo Island for more information. Bagley then turned left again and her gunners scanned the passage between Guadalcanal and Savo Island; but, as the Japanese cruiser force had already passed by to the north, they saw no enemy ships. She then steamed to the northwest, toward the designated destroyer rendezvous point, and at about 0300 came across the heavily damaged and burning . That warship, along with and , had been mortally wounded in the short, but violent, Battle of Savo Island before the Japanese force retired to Rabaul. Bagley came alongside Astoria and rescued about 400 survivors‚Äîincluding 185 wounded‚Äîfrom the stricken warship, out of the water or from nearby rafts. With daylight, Bagley delivered a salvage party of 325 men to Astoria to fight fires, plug holes and raise steam. The effort ultimately failed, and the cruiser sank that afternoon. Meanwhile, Bagley's medical officer and pharmacist's mates treated shell-fragment lacerations and second- degree burns before the wounded were transferred to that afternoon. Bagley then withdrew to Noum√©a with TF 62, mooring there on 13 August. 1943 On 15 March 1943, Bagley executed orders reassigning her to TF 74 as the newly created 7th Fleet readied itself for offensive operations in New Guinea. Underway from Townsville on 27 June, Bagley, in company with Henley and SC-749, escorted six LSTs carrying 2,600 Army troops and airfield equipment to Woodlark Island. While the destroyers patrolled south of the island, the landing proceeded without Japanese interference on the night of 30 June and 1 July. Bagley escorted three more echelons of LSTs from Townsville to Woodlark between 9 July and 7 August; all arrived safely, and the fighter airstrip became operational on 23 July. The destroyer then escorted between Milne Bay, Cairns, and Brisbane, arriving at the last port on 15 August. Bagley steamed back to New Guinea late in the month, delivering a convoy to Milne Bay on 1 October. She quickly returned to Townsville to pick up another convoy, escorting it safely into Milne Bay on the 8th. Sailing again to Australia, this time to Brisbane, the destroyer shepherded a third convoy from Townsville to Milne Bay between 25 and 29 October. After moving to Buna on 8 November, Bagley helped escort a convoy of three LSTs to Finschhafen, delivering supplies to the Australian 20th Brigade on the 11th. Over the next four weeks, the destroyer escorted six more reinforcement convoys out of Buna; three to Finschhafen, one to Lae, one to Woodlark Island, and the last to Cape Cretin on 12 December. After steaming to Buna on 23 December, Bagley joined the seven LSTs of TU 76.1.41, carrying the 7th echelon of 1st Marine Division's engineers, artillery, and stores for the Cape Gloucester operation. The crew watched the heavy cruisers bombard the beach at 0600 on 26 December, and then Bagley screened the LSTs as they landed troops and equipment. That afternoon, around 1430, a large Japanese air raid attacked the task force, sinking and damaging . Later that evening, Bagley's crew saw friendly fighters splash three \\"Betty\\" bombers over the beachhead. Returning to Buna on 28 December, Bagley then helped leapfrog elements of the 32nd Infantry Division to Saidor, New Guinea, bypassing a strong Japanese garrison at Sio. The third echelon convoy landed troops and equipment without incident on 2 January 1944. 1944 Ordered \\"to act as stand-by escort for supply echelons\\", the destroyer delivered a convoy of LSTs to Saidor on 5 February and the next day, in company with and two LSTs, steamed for Cape Gloucester. She departed the region on 10 February, steaming east for the west coast of the United States. Arriving in San Francisco on 27 February, after stops at Florida Island, Guadalcanal, Palmyra, and Pearl Harbor, Bagley entered the Mare Island Navy Yard for a major overhaul on the 28th. Over the next eight weeks, she added two more 20 mm guns (for a total of six) and an improved fire control radar while a twin 40 mm gun tub was placed forward of the two after guns. Underway for Hawaii on 5 May, Bagley began training at sea for Operation \\"Forager\\", the planned invasion of the Marianas. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on the 10th, the destroyer conducted screen, antiaircraft, and shore bombardment drills before sailing for the Marshall Islands on 29 May. Anchoring in Majuro Atoll on 3 June, Bagley joined one of the four fast carrier task groups, putting out to sea with and TG 58.2 on the 8th. =Saipan= The destroyer then moved to the transport area on 15 June, screening the initial landings on Saipan before returning to the bombardment group on the 17th. From that screening position Bagley participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Although primarily an air battle‚Äîlater dubbed \\"The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\\"‚Äîin which most of the several hundred Japanese plane casualties were lost to American fighters, several small groups of Japanese aircraft broke through the CAP. These were mostly driven off by intense antiaircraft fire from the battleships and destroyers. Bagley fired on three planes that day, lobbing 24 5 inch shells at a \\"Val\\" and a \\"Kate\\" at a range of astern and another 147 20 mm and 40 mm shells at a Zero that passed distant to starboard. In the following days, the destroyer continued to screen the battleships as they vainly chased the retreating Japanese. On 25 June, the destroyer returned to the Marianas for two weeks of call-fire assignments in support of Marine Corps operations. Under the direction of fire control units ashore, Bagley fired over 700 5 inch rounds of high-explosive, white phosphorus, and starshell into the final pocket of Japanese resistance at the north end of Saipan. On 6 July, after receiving more ammunition from , she closed shore and fired on \\"caves and crevasses near waters edge on Saipan\\", expending 537 5-inch and over 1,000 rounds of 20-millimeter and 40 mm shells. Bagley screened Enterprise during the strikes on Okinawa and the smaller Ryukyus on 10 September. This was followed by a raid on Aparri in the Philippines on the 11th before the large- scale effort to destroy Japanese air power on Formosa began on 12th. =Leyte Gulf= Bagleys only part in the Battle for Leyte Gulf was to join the ad hoc cruiser-destroyer group dispatched in futile pursuit of the retreating flattops, mere decoys with only half their air component on board. With the Battle for Leyte Gulf over on 25 October, and the surviving Japanese naval forces in retreat, Bagley rejoined the carriers as they stood by to support ground operations on Leyte. In order to destroy Japanese aircraft staging into the central Philippines, TG 38.4 launched attacks on Luzon from its patrol area east of Leyte Gulf on 30 October. Arriving at Ulthui 2 November, Bagley received four days of overhaul from tender Markab (AD-21). The destroyer then sailed on the 10th with TU 77.4.1, built around and , to provide air support for Leyte ground operations. Retiring to Seeadler Harbor on the 27th, the destroyer spent the next month training, or receiving repairs from , all in preparation for Operation Musketeer, the landings on Luzon, Philippine Islands. On 27 December, the destroyer got underway for the Palaus, arriving there on the 30th. 1945 The 12 escort carriers of TG 77.2 and 77.4, and their screen of 19 destroyers, including Bagley, sortied from Kossol Roads on 1 January 1945. The group entered Leyte Gulf on the 3rd and steamed on to the Mindanao Sea, heading for Lingayen Gulf to provide air support for amphibious operations. Late in the afternoon of the 4th, after a day of false alarms and \\"snooper\\" alerts, a single twin-engine Japanese kamikaze crashed into , setting off explosions and fires which destroyed that escort carrier. The next day, after the force entered the South China Sea, four Japanese kamikaze raids attacked the American warships. Although the first two waves were driven off by CAP, Bagleys crew saw suicide planes from the third attack crash , , Australia, and , damaging the latter badly enough to force her retirement to Leyte. Bagley screened the escort carriers between 6 January, when they began flying ground-attack missions over the Lingayen beaches, and 13 January when the next kamikaze plane attacked the group. Just after 0900, an undetected plane surprised and crashed into , causing extensive damage. Several more closed the formation at 0908, and one Nakajima Ki-43 \\"Oscar\\" made a run toward Bagley. All guns that could bear opened fire at , and the plane splashed about out on the port beam. The next four days passed without any Japanese attacks, and the task group retired to Ulithi, arriving there on the 23rd. With Philippine operations well underway, Bagley was assigned to the next major amphibious operation, the landings planned for Iwo Jima in February. On 21 February, after a mere six days to conduct repairs and replenish, the warship embarked upon the last major amphibious operation of the war, the invasion of Okinawa. In company with the escort carriers of TG 52.1, Bagley arrived off Okinawa Jima on 25 March. The destroyer screened during ground attack and support operations into April without incident. Over the next several weeks, numerous small Japanese air raids appeared on her radar screen, but only one closed the formation, an ineffective attack by a lone plane on the 12th. On 28 April, while the escort carriers launched raids on Sakishima Gunto, the crew spotted an Ohka kamikaze pass harmlessly overhead at . On 24 May, after Bagley \\"blew out\\" her number one main generator, she turned toward the Philippines. Arriving in Leyte Gulf on the 27th after 102 days underway at sea, the destroyer went alongside for repairs. The warship's last combat operation began on 15 June when the destroyer departed Leyte for Kerama Retto. She rendezvoused with the six escort carriers of TG 32.1 on the 18th and supported them during a series of air strikes on Okinawa. A week later, however, Bagleys main battery director failed, and she once again retired to Leyte for repairs. After mooring there on 27 June, she went alongside Yosemite for three days of availability. As the tender was unable to repair the director, the warship steamed to Saipan on 5 July and thence on to Guam, arriving in Apra harbor on the 6th. With a new director installed by 14 July, Bagley sailed to Saipan on the 15th. Departing the Marianas on 6 August, the warship escorted a convoy of merchant ships to Okinawa on 12 August. Three days later, her crew heard of the Japanese capitulation while shepherding a return convoy back to Saipan. Following 10 days of rest and recreation, Bagley embarked Rear Admiral Francis E. M. Whiting and staff for transport to Marcus Island. She arrived there on 31 August, and Japanese Rear Admiral Matsubara Masata surrendered the island and its garrison to Rear Admiral Whiting on board Bagley. Returning to Saipan on 2 September, the destroyer then reported to the Commander, 5th Fleet, for extended duty. After a brief stop at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, the destroyer sailed for Japan, arriving in Sasebo on 20 September. Bagley spent the next five weeks operating as a minefield marker ship, assisting minesweeping efforts, and providing courier services between Sasebo, Nagasaki, and Wakayama. Several officers also inspected various Japanese naval vessels in port to determine compliance with Allied surrender terms. =Fate= The destroyer departed Sasebo on 29 October for the United States and, steaming via Pearl Harbor, arrived in San Diego on 19 November. Originally marked for use in experimental testing, probably the two-detonation series of atomic tests held in the summer of 1946 at Bikini Atoll (see Operation Crossroads) in the central Pacific, Bagley steamed to Pearl Harbor in late April 1946.

Today, the school is just above 7% Quaker. At Friends, global education encompasses signature international programs (International Baccalaureate, inter-divisional Chinese, School Year Abroad) and an overall approach that teaches students to engage complex issues intellectually and in action, in and outside of the classroom, with a sense of confidence and responsibility. The school was founded in 1748 by members of the Wilmington Monthly Meeting of Friends (Quakers). Wilmington Friends School originally aimed to provide education for children belonging to the Society of Friends and to poor children, whatever their race, religion, or family's financial circumstance. Delaware historian Benjamin Ferris wrote in the 19th century \\"Thousands of children have there received the first rudiments of an English education.\\" As Delaware started offering public education, the School moved toward its current all college-preparatory program. In 1937, the Friends School moved from its original site to its current location in Alapocas, just outside the city. Wilmington Friends School is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, and is authorized by the International Baccalaureate Organization and School Year Abroad. Friends integrates global perspective throughout its curriculum, and emphasizes athletics, the arts, and service as integral to the program of studies. Religious Component Students are not required to be Quaker to attend Friends, but the school does expect students to embody the \\"Quaker SPICES\\", those being simplicity, peace, integrity, community, equality, and stewardship. Both the Lower School and the Upper/Middle School are equipped with Meeting Rooms in which students meet every week for Meeting for Worship, a time of silent reflection. While in Middle School, students sit for only 25 minutes, Upper School Students meet for 45. Meeting for Worship takes many forms, the most common of which is silent. Occasionally such options as Meeting for Singing, Meeting for Doodling, Meeting in Advisory, and Meeting in Small Groups take place. Notable Alumni *James A.

Students from most of Lake Zurich, Hawthorn Woods portions of Kildeer, Deer Park, North Barrington and unincorporated areas such as Forest Lake and Echo Lake attend Lake Zurich High School. History Lake Zurich High school first opened its doors to students in 1926 as Ela-Vernon High School, serving Ela and Vernon Townships in Lake County, Illinois. In 1964, area residents built a second high school which was to be called Ela-Vernon East. A series of disagreements between Vernon Township residents and Ela Township residents led to the split of the school district and Stevenson High School opened in nearby Lincolnshire drawing students from the eastern half of Ela Township and all of Vernon Township. As a result of the split, a rivalry existed between the schools, and each fall the football teams competed for what was known as \\"The Cannon\\". The Cannon was a miniature steel replica of the real thing, and fired a blank shotgun shell when teams entered the field, and or scored a touchdown. The Cannon was retired in 1982, after Stevenson and Lake Zurich discontinued their football rivalry, as a result of a differing enrollment and different athletic conference affiliations. Lake Zurich won the last game involving the cannon in 1982.

A tracer gun, sometimes known as a disc gun, is a kind of toy gun made of durable plastic. The toy shoots lightweight plastic discs roughly the size of a penny.

The discs used as ammunition for these guns are often sold with the label \\"Jet Discs.\\" The firing mechanism is a spring, The magazine holds 20 \\"discs.\\" Range is about 10 feet, and even then, accuracy is far from dependable. The trigger requires some force. The firing sound is a loud, low, and distinctive \\"snap!\\". Oftentimes the trigger will become loose and will take multiple attempts to shoot. Early models The gun was manufactured starting in the 1960s, at which time it was called the \\"Rapid-Fire Tracer Gun\\". It was available in greenish bronze or bluish silver. Many of these older guns were made by Ray Plastics Inc. in the United States under the brand name \\"Rayline\\". A rifle version of the tracer gun was also made, called the \\"Jet Disc Tracer-Scope\\". There was even a collectible Star Trek version, called the \\"Star Trek Tracer Gun\\" and \\"Star Trek Tracer-Scope\\", first made in 1966 and one of the earliest Star Trek licensed products.

KLMO-FM simulcast the middle of the road music and news heard on its AM counterpart. =KQKS= In December 1986, KLMO-FM was sold to local owner Western Cities Broadcasting. Western Cities got the Federal Communications Commission to permit 104.3 to boost its power to 100,000 watts, now covering the entire Denver market. The station switched to an adult contemporary music format, changing its call sign to KQKS as \\"104.3 Kiss FM\\".Broadcasting Yearbook 1989 page B-50 In mid-1987, the branding was shortened to \\"KS104\\". On August 1, 1987, amidst heavy competition against three other AC FM's in the Denver market, and with only one Top 40 (CHR) station in the market, KQKS segued to a Top 40/CHR format.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-08-07.pdf By 1989, the station evolved into a Dance- leaning Rhythmic Top 40 direction, but by 1993, KQKS started shifting back to a mainstream Top 40 direction again when it became the only Top 40 in the market. However, by 1995, KQKS would see competition from two new stations, KHHT (K-HITS 107.5) and KALC (Alice 105.9), going after listeners with a mainstream Top 40 direction. As a result, KQKS returned to rhythmic contemporary hits that year. But by 1996, KQKS would receive a major jolt when the station's DJs defected to another new rhythmic contemporary hit radio station, KJMN (JAM'N 92.1), and began attacking them on-air and on the streets. =Switch to Country and Smooth Jazz= In November 1996, Western Cities sold the station to Jefferson-Pilot. On January 8, 1997, Jefferson- Pilot (which later became part of the Lincoln Financial Group) moved the KQKS call sign and Rhythmic Top 40 format to 107.5 MHz.

Regional profile This is arguably the most competitive region in Ontario and one of the most competitive in all of Canada, as all three major parties have significant strength. Traditionally a conservative-leaning area outside of Hamilton and Welland, the Conservatives won the majority of seats in the 1970s and 1980s, aside from 1974 when the Liberals did well, taking six of nine. Before that the Liberals had dominated the area in the 1960s and from 1940 to 1953 with the Conservatives dominating in the two late 1950s elections and in the 1920s and 1930s. The entire area went for the Liberals in their sweeps of Ontario from 1993 to 2000, with the popularity of local left-leaning Liberal Sheila Copps and the prominence of her parents (Victor and Geraldine) at the municipal level in Hamilton being major factors. Some of this changed in 2004, the year that happened to coincide with Sheila Copps' departure from federal politics. In Hamilton proper, the New Democratic Party managed to pick up one seat from the Liberals in 2004 and picked up two more in 2006 to sweep urban Hamilton. The Conservatives picked up two seats from the Liberals in 2004 and four more in 2006, leaving the Liberals with only Welland in 2006. The 2008 and 2011 elections saw the Liberals shutout of the area as the NDP retained its stronghold in Hamilton and added Welland from the Liberals for four seats. The Conservatives claimed the other six ridings in the area each election from 2006 to 2011. In the 2015 Liberal election victory, the Conservatives held the three most rural ridings plus Niagara Falls, while the NDP retained two of its Hamilton seats, the two fully within the city, but lost its Welland seat (realigned and renamed to Niagara Centre) to the Liberals who claimed the other five seats in the area. In recent decades, the Liberals have support throughout the region, but no real stronghold of support, which means there are no real safe seats for the party in this area. Several ridings are competitive 3-way districts most elections, although Hamilton's four seats and Niagara Centre generally switch between the Liberals and NDP.. 2015, 42nd General Election 2011, 41st General Election 2008, 40th General Election 2006, 39th General Election 2004, 38th General Election Key map #Ancaster-Dundas-Flamborough-Westdale #Burlington #Halton #Hamilton Centre #Hamilton East #Hamilton Mountain #Niagara Falls #Niagara West-Glanbrook #St. Catharines #Welland Image:hbcpc.PNGConservative Party of Canada Image:hbgpc.PNGGreen Party of Canada Image:hblpc.PNGLiberal Party of Canada Image:hbndp.PNGNew Democratic Party Hamilton Politics of Hamilton, Ontario ","title":"Canadian federal election results in Hamilton, Burlington and Niagara"},{"id":"2844248","text":"The Z Was Zapped () is a picture book by the American author Chris Van Allsburg originally published in 1987 by Houghton Mifflin.

The station traces its history back to the October 5, 1946 launch of the first FM radio station to sign on in Texas, \\"KERA-FM\\" (no relation to the current radio and television stations known under the same call letters), although its roots go back to an experimental FM station \\"W5X1C\\" that signed on October 15, 1945, and another experimental trial dating back to 1939. By 1947, it had moved from its original home at 94.3 FM to a preferred location in the center of the dial at 97.9 FM under the WFAA-FM callsign, initially simulcasting its AM sister station WFAA (570 AM). With FM broadcasting in its infancy, Belo decided that the FM simulcast was not worthwhile and signed WFAA-FM off the air on September 1, 1950. The frequency remained dormant until Belo decided to revive WFAA-FM in 1958, receiving a construction permit and putting WFAA-FM back on the air on January 6, 1961. After simulcasting WFAA(AM) for a few years, a Beautiful music was established in 1965. In September 1973, WFAA-FM flipped to album-oriented rock (AOR) as KZEW-FM (known to listeners as \\"The Zoo\\") on September 16, 1973. Featuring talent such as John LaBella and John Rody (\\"LaBella and Rody\\"), George Gimarc, Charley Jones, Dave Lee Austin, John B. Wells, Nancy Johnson, John Dew, John Dillon, Doc Morgan and Tempie Lindsey, the station's concept and programming were initially under the direction of Ira Lipson. The FM station shared studio locations with WFAA (AM) on the second floor of the facility. In September 1973, WFAA-FM changed its call letters to KZEW and played classic and progressive rock music for 16 years with the on-air slogan The Zoo. In 1987, KZEW and KRQX (the former WFAA radio, now KLIF) were sold by A.H. Belo Corporation, which retained ownership of the Dallas Morning News and WFAA-TV (channel 8), to Cox Radio. On December 11, 1989, KZEW dropped the rock format and began stunting with Christmas music. On January 1, 1990, KZEW switched formats to soft rock, changing both calls and branding to KKWM (\\"Warm 97.9\\"). A year later, the station changed its callsign and station nickname again to KLRX, \\"Lite 97.9\\", while maintaining its soft rock format. =The Infinity/CBS years= Arrow 97.9 logo used 1993-1997.

KBFB made the change to Urban Contemporary as \\"97.9 The Beat\\" on September 26, 2000, after the station was sold to Radio One. Since launch, the station has been in direct competition against longtime heritage urban station KKDA. In addition to KKDA, they also had a competitor with former Rhythmic Contemporary rival KZZA until the station flipped to Spanish Oldies in 2008. Today, KBFB competes with KKDA, along to an extent with CHR formats on KHKS-FM (106.1 Kiss FM), and KLIF-FM (Hot 93.3). Throughout the years as \\"The Beat,\\" the station has shifted between Urban Contemporary and CHR/Rhythmic. As of November 2013, KBFB reports as a Rhythmic station to Mediabase. In the beginning, the morning show on the station was hosted by Russ Parr (who started his radio career at defunct KJMZ in the Metroplex). In 2003, it was home to Steve Harvey in the mornings through a syndicated simulcast from its sister station in Los Angeles, KKBT (also nicknamed \\"The Beat\\"). Eventually, Radio One let Harvey go and the Rickey Smiley Morning Show replaced him in 2005. Smiley was dropped in the fall of 2017. =HD programming= Since the mid 2000s, KBFB has also broadcast on HD Radio, though they never had a secondary HD multicast until March 2014.

The novel deals fairly with the question of racism within the US forces during World War II and portrays black characters with great sympathy and support. Plot summary The story tells of the experiences of one John (Jackie) Turner, whom the doctors have given just one year to live as a result of a severe head injury sustained when the aircraft in which he was travelling was attacked by a German fighter in the Second World War. Turner decides to use his remaining time to trace the men he got to know while recovering in hospital. The men were: * Flying Officer Phillip Morgan: the plane's British pilot. * Corporal Duggie Brent: a young British Commando, accused of murder. * Pfc Dave Lesurier: a black American serviceman, accused of attempted rape, in hospital after cutting his own throat while being pursued. As the story unfolds, we learn that charges against Lesurier were dropped after an Army investigation and that he later returned to the English town near which he was stationed during the war. He marries the girl he was courting and becomes a draughtsman. Brent is acquitted of murder but served six months for manslaughter after a brilliantly defended court-martial. He is later found living close to Lesurier and working as a meat vendor. Morgan relocates to Burma and becomes a successful businessman, married into a strong local community. Turner is contented by the thought that each man, who had helped with his recovery after the plane crash, had succeeded in making a good life in his own way. The novel ends with what will be his last visit to his medical specialist. Underlying the novel is the Buddhist belief in reincarnation and redemption. Despite his shady past, it is indicated that Turner, through his attempts to help his fellow patients and his acceptance of his death, has moved closer to Nirvana.  Production  The book's title is taken from Stanza XLVIX of Edward FitzGerald's Rub√°iy√°t of Khayy√°m: > 'Tis all a Chequer-board of Nights and Days Where Destiny with Men for > Pieces plays: Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays, And one by one > back in the Closet lays. Shute began writing The Chequer Board September 1945 and completed it February 1946. The portions of the book that take place in Burma were based on his own experiences there during World War II. From the dust-jacket: \\"It was very difficult to feel these cultured brown girls, all speaking excellent English...were really any different from the girls at home.\\" He also noted during the war the \\"popularity of American Negroes in England and the superior quality of the Burmese people\\", both of which are central to the book's story.  Reception  Shute was concerned that sales of the book in the United States would be reduced because of the book's open-minded handling of racial issues; as it turned out, sales soared. Shute and his wife travelled around the U.S. on Greyhound buses to \\"get in touch with the man on the street,\\" finding the experience refreshing.

According to Aristotle, whoever controls the courts controls the state. These courts were jury courts and very large ones: the smallest possible had 200 members (+1 to avoid ties) and sometimes 501, 1000 or 1500. The annual pool of jurors, whose official name was Heliaia, comprised 6000 members. At least on one known occasion the whole six thousand sat together to judge a single case (a plenary session of the Heliaia). This was very different from Rome's laws, as in Rome, jury representatives were elected. The Athenian jurors were chosen randomly by lot, which meant that juries would consist, in theory, of a wide range of members from different social classes. Jurors were chosen on an annual basis, as were all other offices within the state (with the exception of the generals, known as strategoi). After the reforms of Solon in 594/3 BC, anyone from each of the four classes (the pentacosiomedimni, hippeis, zeugites and thetes) could become a juror. This was meant to make the system much fairer to the poorer members of society, who had previously been excluded in favour of the elitist aristocrats. The archons who convened the courts had a purely administrative function and gave no legal direction or advice to the jurors: there was no judge but the jurors themselves. From the time of Pericles onwards, jury pay was introduced. This was two obols a day, which, despite not being a substantial amount of money, was enough to encourage even the poorest to become a juror. This was later increased to three obols a day by Cleon. The law courts in Athens were different and diverse: as time changed they changed too. They originated from the Council of the elite and wealthy who were in charge and ended up being open to any free male who was in the army. Athens valued justice and they had many different reforms as different challenges arose. The Athenian law court was large and decisions were made by majority. The courts could also exile those from society who were gaining too much power and could become tyrants. The laws of Athens also changed as the courts changed to work better with society. ‚ÄúThe early Greeks were a litigious lot.‚Äù\\"Criminal Procedure in Ancient Athens and in the Trial of Socrates.\\" Criminal Procedure in Ancient Athens and in the Trial of Socrates.

The courts were around the Agora sometimes and other times, like in a serious case against an official still in office, they were held on the Pnyx which was an open area on a hill. The courts were very large as there were many members of the jury so finding a single building to hold everyone was sometimes difficult. Different scholars say that there were different areas where the trials took place. The trials were diverse in their matters, public and private, and the courts were diverse in their makeups (number of jurors). Most of the trials took place in the main part of the city, the Agora, but some happened throughout the city and surrounding area. Many Athenians would attend trials and participate regardless of weather.McGregor, James H. \\"The Athenian Agora.\\" Athens. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap of Harvard UP, 2014. 89-91. Print.

They made the decisions and served for life. Slowly things began to change as the group which was in power widened, included more people, and they did not serve for a lifetime. Things radically changed when Draco implemented his reforms which made it so that any male who could afford full armor could participate in politics. This greatly changed the court as now ‚Äúcommon men‚Äù could serve on it and could bring forth a case if their rights had been violated. Solon also brought about reforms, and he kept the Council the ruling body at the time of politics and judicial matters, with four hundred members, a hundred from each tribe. The Council was the most powerful organization and would remain so until after the Persian invasion and more reforms did away with most of the power of the Council. There was further turmoil, however, as people tried to seize power until Cleisthenes made ten tribes where each would send fifty members to the council. Each tribe had no links to the others. After the Persian invasion the Council of Areopagus, still composed of the very wealthy, slowly lost power and the law courts were established as they took over many of the jobs the Council had exercised.McGregor, James H. \\"The Athenian Agora.\\" Athens.

Extreme attention was paid to the case to find the murderer to expel them from society so society could be cleansed. The Council of Areopagus, even after losing much of its other power, was still in charge of murder trials. There was a big problem when no person was convicted of the murder. The trial was sent to a different and special court. If this court could not find the person responsible they would blame the weapon. The Athenians would then exile the weapon to help restore society.McGregor, James H. \\"The Athenian Agora.\\" Athens. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap of Harvard UP, 2014. 91-92. Print. Exiling The Athenians had a way to remove or exile a person from society if they had gained too much power to prevent tyranny. It was not entirely successful in preventing tyrants though. On a certain day in the winter, citizens would come and they had the opportunity to exile an individual. There were ten gates in the Agora, the main building, each gate for a different tribe.

Spin structures have wide applications to mathematical physics, in particular to quantum field theory where they are an essential ingredient in the definition of any theory with uncharged fermions. They are also of purely mathematical interest in differential geometry, algebraic topology, and K theory. They form the foundation for spin geometry. Overview In geometry and in field theory, mathematicians ask whether or not a given oriented Riemannian manifold (M,g) admits spinors. One method for dealing with this problem is to require that M has a spin structure. This is not always possible since there is potentially a topological obstruction to the existence of spin structures. Spin structures will exist if and only if the second Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney class w2(M) ‚àà H2(M, Z2) of M vanishes. Furthermore, if w2(M) = 0, then the set of the isomorphism classes of spin structures on M is acted upon freely and transitively by H1(M, Z2) . As the manifold M is assumed to be oriented, the first Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney class w1(M) ‚àà H1(M, Z2) of M vanishes too. (The Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney classes wi(M) ‚àà Hi(M, Z2) of a manifold M are defined to be the Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney classes of its tangent bundle TM.) The bundle of spinors œÄS: S ‚Üí M over M is then the complex vector bundle associated with the corresponding principal bundle œÄP: P ‚Üí M of spin frames over M and the spin representation of its structure group Spin(n) on the space of spinors Œîn. The bundle S is called the spinor bundle for a given spin structure on M. A precise definition of spin structure on manifold was possible only after the notion of fiber bundle had been introduced; Andr√© Haefliger (1956) found the topological obstruction to the existence of a spin structure on an orientable Riemannian manifold and Max Karoubi (1968) extended this result to the non-orientable pseudo-Riemannian case. Spin structures on Riemannian manifolds =Definition= A spin structure on an orientable Riemannian manifold (M,g) is an equivariant lift of the oriented orthonormal frame bundle FSO(M) ‚Üí M with respect to the double covering œÅ: Spin(n) ‚Üí SO(n). In other words, a pair (P,FP) is a spin structure on the principal bundle œÄ: FSO(M) ‚Üí M when :a) œÄP: P ‚Üí M is a principal Spin(n)-bundle over M, :b) FP: P ‚Üí FSO(M) is an equivariant 2-fold covering map such that ::picirc F_{mathbf P}=pi_{mathbf P} and FP(p q) = FP(p)œÅ(q) for all p ‚àà P and q ‚àà Spin(n). The principal bundle œÄP: P ‚Üí M is also called the bundle of spin frames over M. Two spin structures (P1, FP1) and (P2, FP2) on the same oriented Riemannian manifold (M,g) are called \\"equivalent\\" if there exists a Spin(n)-equivariant map f: P1 ‚Üí P2 such that :F_{mathbf P_2}circ f=F_{mathbf P_1} and f(p q) = f(p)q for all {mathbf p}in {mathbf P_1} and q ‚àà Spin(n). Of course, in this case F_{mathbf P_1} and F_{mathbf P_2} are two equivalent double coverings of the oriented orthonormal frame SO(n)-bundle FSO(M) ‚Üí M of the given Riemannian manifold (M,g). This definition of spin structure on (M,g) as a spin structure on the principal bundle FSO(M) ‚Üí M is due to Andr√© Haefliger (1956). =Obstruction= Andr√© Haefliger found necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a spin structure on an oriented Riemannian manifold (M,g). The obstruction to having a spin structure is a certain element [k] of H2(M, Z2) . For a spin structure the class [k] is the second Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney class w2(M) ‚àà H2(M, Z2) of M. Hence, a spin structure exists if and only if the second Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney class w2(M) ‚àà H2(M, Z2) of M vanishes. Spin structures on vector bundles Let M be a paracompact topological manifold and E an oriented vector bundle on M of dimension n equipped with a fibre metric. This means that at each point of M, the fibre of E is an inner product space. A spinor bundle of E is a prescription for consistently associating a spin representation to every point of M. There are topological obstructions to being able to do it, and consequently, a given bundle E may not admit any spinor bundle. In case it does, one says that the bundle E is spin. This may be made rigorous through the language of principal bundles. The collection of oriented orthonormal frames of a vector bundle form a frame bundle PSO(E), which is a principal bundle under the action of the special orthogonal group SO(n). A spin structure for PSO(E) is a lift of PSO(E) to a principal bundle PSpin(E) under the action of the spin group Spin(n), by which we mean that there exists a bundle map œÜ : PSpin(E) ‚Üí PSO(E) such that :phi(pg) = phi(p)rho(g), for all and , where is the mapping of groups presenting the spin group as a double- cover of SO(n). In the special case in which E is the tangent bundle TM over the base manifold M, if a spin structure exists then one says that M is a spin manifold. Equivalently M is spin if the SO(n) principal bundle of orthonormal bases of the tangent fibers of M is a Z2 quotient of a principal spin bundle. If the manifold has a cell decomposition or a triangulation, a spin structure can equivalently be thought of as a homotopy-class of trivialization of the tangent bundle over the 1-skeleton that extends over the 2-skeleton. If the dimension is lower than 3, one first takes a Whitney sum with a trivial line bundle. =Obstruction= A spin structure on a vector bundle E exists if and only if the second Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney class w2 of E vanishes. This is a result of Armand Borel and Friedrich Hirzebruch. Note, we have assumed œÄE: E ‚Üí M is an orientable vector bundle. =Classification= When spin structures exist, the inequivalent spin structures on a manifold have a one-to-one correspondence (not canonical) with the elements of H1(M,Z2), which by the universal coefficient theorem is isomorphic to H1(M,Z2). More precisely, the space of the isomorphism classes of spin structures is an affine space over H1(M,Z2). Intuitively, for each nontrivial cycle on M a spin structure corresponds to a binary choice of whether a section of the SO(N) bundle switches sheets when one encircles the loop. If w2 vanishes then these choices may be extended over the two-skeleton, then (by obstruction theory) they may automatically be extended over all of M. In particle physics this corresponds to a choice of periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions for fermions going around each loop. Note that on a complex manifold X the second Stiefel-Whitney class can be computed as the first chern class text{mod } 2. =Examples= # A genus g Riemann surface admits 22g inequivalent spin structures; see theta characteristic. # If H2(M,Z2) vanishes, M is spin. For example, Sn is spin for all n eq 2 . (Note that S2 is also spin, but for different reasons; see below.) # The complex projective plane CP2 is not spin. # More generally, all even-dimensional complex projective spaces CP2n are not spin. # All odd- dimensional complex projective spaces CP2n+1 are spin. # All compact, orientable manifolds of dimension 3 or less are spin. # All Calabi‚ÄìYau manifolds are spin. = Properties = * The √Ç genus of a spin manifold is an integer, and is an even integer if in addition the dimension is 4 mod 8. *:In general the √Ç genus is a rational invariant, defined for any manifold, but it is not in general an integer. *:This was originally proven by Hirzebruch and Borel, and can be proven by the Atiyah‚ÄìSinger index theorem, by realizing the √Ç genus as the index of a Dirac operator ‚Äì a Dirac operator is a square root of a second order operator, and exists due to the spin structure being a \\"square root\\". This was a motivating example for the index theorem. SpinC structures A spinC structure is analogous to a spin structure on an oriented Riemannian manifold, but uses the SpinC group, which is defined instead by the exact sequence :1 to mathbf{Z}_2 to operatorname{Spin}^{mathbf{C}}(n) to operatorname{SO}(n)times operatorname{U}(1) to 1. To motivate this, suppose that is a complex spinor representation. The center of U(N) consists of the diagonal elements coming from the inclusion , i.e., the scalar multiples of the identity. Thus there is a homomorphism :kappatimes icolon {mathrm {Spin}}(n)times {mathrm U}(1)to {mathrm U}(N). This will always have the element (‚àí1,‚àí1) in the kernel. Taking the quotient modulo this element gives the group SpinC(n). This is the twisted product :{mathrm {Spin}}^{mathbb C}(n) = {mathrm {Spin}}(n)times_{mathbb Z_2} {mathrm U}(1), , where U(1) = SO(2) = S1. In other words, the group SpinC(n) is a central extension of SO(n) by S1. Viewed another way, SpinC(n) is the quotient group obtained from with respect to the normal Z2 which is generated by the pair of covering transformations for the bundles and respectively. This makes the SpinC group both a bundle over the circle with fibre Spin(n), and a bundle over SO(n) with fibre a circle. The fundamental group œÄ1(SpinC(n)) is isomorphic to Z if n ‚â† 2, and to Z ‚äï Z if n = 2. If the manifold has a cell decomposition or a triangulation, a spinC structure can be equivalently thought of as a homotopy class of complex structure over the 2-skeleton that extends over the 3-skeleton. Similarly to the case of spin structures, one takes a Whitney sum with a trivial line bundle if the manifold is odd- dimensional. Yet another definition is that a spinC structure on a manifold N is a complex line bundle L over N together with a spin structure on . =Obstruction= A spinC structure exists when the bundle is orientable and the second Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney class of the bundle E is in the image of the map (in other words, the third integral Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney class vanishes). In this case one says that E is spinC. Intuitively, the lift gives the Chern class of the square of the U(1) part of any obtained spinC bundle. By a theorem of Hopf and Hirzebruch, closed orientable 4-manifolds always admit a spinC structure. =Classification= When a manifold carries a spinC structure at all, the set of spinC structures forms an affine space. Moreover, the set of spinC structures has a free transitive action of . Thus, spinC-structures correspond to elements of although not in a natural way. Geometric picture This has the following geometric interpretation, which is due to Edward Witten. When the spinC structure is nonzero this square root bundle has a non-integral Chern class, which means that it fails the triple overlap condition. In particular, the product of transition functions on a three-way intersection is not always equal to one, as is required for a principal bundle. Instead it is sometimes ‚àí1. This failure occurs at precisely the same intersections as an identical failure in the triple products of transition functions of the obstructed spin bundle. Therefore, the triple products of transition functions of the full spinc bundle, which are the products of the triple product of the spin and U(1) component bundles, are either or and so the spinC bundle satisfies the triple overlap condition and is therefore a legitimate bundle. The details The above intuitive geometric picture may be made concrete as follows. Consider the short exact sequence , where the second arrow is multiplication by 2 and the third is reduction modulo 2. This induces a long exact sequence on cohomology, which contains ::dots longrightarrow textrm H^2(M;mathbf Z) stackrel {2} {longrightarrow} textrm H^2(M;mathbf Z) longrightarrow textrm H^2(M;mathbf Z_2) stackrel {beta}longrightarrow textrm H^3(M;mathbf Z) longrightarrow dots , where the second arrow is induced by multiplication by 2, the third is induced by restriction modulo 2 and the fourth is the associated Bockstein homomorphism Œ≤. The obstruction to the existence of a spin bundle is an element w2 of . It reflects the fact that one may always locally lift an SO(n) bundle to a spin bundle, but one needs to choose a Z2 lift of each transition function, which is a choice of sign. The lift does not exist when the product of these three signs on a triple overlap is ‚àí1, which yields the ƒåech cohomology picture of w2. To cancel this obstruction, one tensors this spin bundle with a U(1) bundle with the same obstruction w2. Notice that this is an abuse of the word bundle, as neither the spin bundle nor the U(1) bundle satisfies the triple overlap condition and so neither is actually a bundle. A legitimate U(1) bundle is classified by its Chern class, which is an element of H2(M,Z). Identify this class with the first element in the above exact sequence. The next arrow doubles this Chern class, and so legitimate bundles will correspond to even elements in the second , while odd elements will correspond to bundles that fail the triple overlap condition. The obstruction then is classified by the failure of an element in the second H2(M,Z) to be in the image of the arrow, which, by exactness, is classified by its image in H2(M,Z2) under the next arrow. To cancel the corresponding obstruction in the spin bundle, this image needs to be w2. In particular, if w2 is not in the image of the arrow, then there does not exist any U(1) bundle with obstruction equal to w2 and so the obstruction cannot be cancelled. By exactness, w2 is in the image of the preceding arrow only if it is in the kernel of the next arrow, which we recall is the Bockstein homomorphism Œ≤. That is, the condition for the cancellation of the obstruction is :::W_3=beta w_2=0 where we have used the fact that the third integral Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney class W3 is the Bockstein of the second Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney class w2 (this can be taken as a definition of W3). Integral lifts of Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney classes This argument also demonstrates that second Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney class defines elements not only of Z2 cohomology but also of integral cohomology in one higher degree. In fact this is the case for all even Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney classes. It is traditional to use an uppercase W for the resulting classes in odd degree, which are called the integral Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney classes, and are labeled by their degree (which is always odd). =Examples= # All oriented smooth manifolds of dimension 4 or less are spinC. # All almost complex manifolds are spinC. # All spin manifolds are spinC. Application to particle physics In particle physics the spin‚Äìstatistics theorem implies that the wavefunction of an uncharged fermion is a section of the associated vector bundle to the spin lift of an SO(N) bundle E. Therefore, the choice of spin structure is part of the data needed to define the wavefunction, and one often needs to sum over these choices in the partition function. In many physical theories E is the tangent bundle, but for the fermions on the worldvolumes of D-branes in string theory it is a normal bundle. In quantum field theory charged spinors are sections of associated spinc bundles, and in particular no charged spinors can exist on a space that is not spinc. An exception arises in some supergravity theories where additional interactions imply that other fields may cancel the third Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney class. The mathematical description of spinors in supergravity and string theory is a particularly subtle open problem, which was recently addressed in references.. It turns out that the standard notion of spin structure is too restrictive for applications to supergravity and string theory, and that the correct notion of spinorial structure for the mathematical formulation of these theories is a \\"Lipschitz structure\\".

Programming The airstaff includes Dom Testa and Jeremy Padgett in the morning. Other station DJs Steve Marshall, Shannon Steele, and Sinna-G. KIMN carries the syndicated countdown show American Top 40, hosted by Ryan Seacrest. History =KLIR-FM, KXLT and KMJI= On July 9, 1959, the station signed on as KLIR-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page It was the FM counterpart to AM 990 KLIR (now KRKS). It was owned by George Basil Anderson and had an effective radiated power (ERP) of 8,800 watts, a fraction of its current power. KLIR-FM originally simulcast the AM station but later began airing a beautiful music/MOR format. Denver's first airborne traffic reporter was Don Martin (1932 - 2019), on KIMN's \\"Air Alert\\", who later became the vice-president of news operations, and is considered the pioneer of live news coverage in Denver. In 2007, Martin was inducted into the Broadcast Pioneers of Colorado Hall of Fame. On June 7, 1984, the station switched to an Adult Contemporary format as KMJI (\\"Majic 100\\"), but would later tweak its direction to Soft AC and change its calls to KXLT (\\"K-Lite 100\\"). In November 1991, the station returned to the \\"Majic 100\\" moniker, and in 1992, the call letters switched back to KMJI.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- Billboard/90s/1991/BB-1991-11-16.pdf The format evolved to all-'70s hits in June 1994.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-04-29.pdf =KIM 100/Mix 100= The KIMN call letters were picked up on April 18, 1995, along with the name \\"KIM 100.\\"http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1995/RR-1995-04-21.pdf (From the late 1950s to the early ‚Äò80s, KIMN had been a popular Top 40 station on AM 950.)

Despite the format adjustment, KIMN continues to report to both Mediabase and Billboard/BDS's Adult Top 40 charts. The shift also put the station more in competition with Adult Top 40 rival KALC, owned by Entercom, and iHeartMedia's Top 40/CHR KPTT.

The tablets were used to ask the gods, place spirits, or the deceased to perform an action on a person or object, or otherwise compel the subject of the curse. Description One of the 130 Bath curse tablets. The inscription in British Latin translates as: \\"May he who carried off Vilbia from me become liquid as the water. May she who so obscenely devoured her become dumb\\" Curse tablets are typically very thin sheets of lead with the text scratched on in tiny letters. They were then often rolled, folded, or pierced with nails, and the tablets were then usually placed beneath the ground: either buried in graves or tombs, thrown into wells or pools, sequestered in underground sanctuaries, or nailed to the walls of temples. Tablets were also used for love spells and, when used in this manner they were placed inside the home of the desired target. They are sometimes discovered along with small dolls or figurines (sometimes inaccurately referred to as \\"Voodoo dolls\\"), which may also be pierced by nails. The figurines resembled the target and often had both their feet and hands bound. Curse tablets also included hair or pieces of clothing. This is especially the case in love spells, which calls for ‚Äúhair from the head of the love target.‚Äù Some love spells have even been discovered ‚Äúfolded around some hair,‚Äù probably to bind the spell itself. ‚ÄúNot all tablets included a personal name, but it is clear especially in the Roman period, that tablets were sometimes prepared in advance, with space left for inserting the names provided by paying customers.\\" The cursing rituals may also have incorporated physical binding gestures and spoken elements. The texts on curse tablets are typically addressed to infernal or liminal gods such as Pluto, Charon, Hecate, and Persephone, sometimes via the mediation of a dead person (probably the corpse in whose grave the tablet was deposited). Some texts do not invoke the gods, however, but merely list the targets of the curse, the crimes or conditions upon which the curse is valid, and/or the intended ill to befall them. Some tablets are inscribed with nothing more than the names of the targets, leading to the supposition that an oral spell may have accompanied the manufacture of the curse. The texts on the tablets were not always curses; tablets were also used to help the dead. Those at whose grave sites these were placed had usually died at a very young age or in a violent manner, and the tablet was supposed to help lay their souls to rest in spite of their untimely deaths. The language of those texts that do give context is often concerned with justice, either listing the target's crimes in great detail, handing over responsibility for their punishment to the gods, using indefinite grammar. Frequently, such curse tablets are also inscribed with additional, otherwise meaningless \\"curse\\" words such as Bazagra, Bescu, or Berebescu, seemingly in order to lend them a kind of supernatural efficacy. Curse Tablet found in London. Inscription reads: \\"I curse Tretia Maria and her life and mind and memory and liver and lungs mixed up together, and her words, thoughts and memory; thus may she be unable to speak what things are concealed, nor be able.\\" (translation: British Museum) Many of those discovered at Athens refer to court cases and curse the opposing litigant, asking (\\"May he...\\") that he botch his performance in court, forget his words, become dizzy and so forth. Others include erotic binding-spells, spells ranged against thieves, and business and sporting rivals. Those curse tablets targeted at thieves or other criminals may have been more public, more acceptable; some scholars even refuse to apply the word \\"curse\\" to such \\"positive\\" texts, preferring expressions such as \\"judicial prayers\\". In 1979/1980, the Bath curse tablets were found at the site of Aquae Sulis (now Bath in England). All but one of the 130 tablets concerned the restitution of stolen goods. Over 80 similar tablets have been discovered in and about the remains of a temple to Mercury nearby, at West Hill, Uley,. making south-western Britain one of the major centres for finds of Latin defixiones. In Ancient Egypt, so-called \\"Execration Texts\\" appear around the time of the 12th Dynasty, listing the names of enemies written on clay figurines or pottery which were then smashed and buried beneath a building under construction (so that they were symbolically \\"smothered\\"), or in a cemetery.. Voces mysticae Voces mysticae are words not immediately recognizable as belonging to any known language, and are commonly associated with curse tablets. Anthropologist Stanely J. Tambiah proposed in 1968 that such words were intended to represent \\"the language that demons can understand\\". Scholars from antiquity, like Christian philosopher Clement of Alexandria (ca. 200 CE), believed that human language was not appropriate for addressing the gods. Therefore, some of the inscriptions of these curse tablets are not easily translatable, because they were \\"invocations and secret names\\" which would only be understood by the spirits themselves. Another possibility is that curse tablets were produced by professionals who wished to lend their art a degree of mystique through the use of an apparently secret language that only they could understand. In support of this theory, at least some tablets appear to have blank spaces instead of a name for the target, suggesting they were prepared in advance, and that the desired target's name would be added on behalf of the customer. Historiography People of the Greco-Roman society believed they could use magic to control the natural world.see Green, Peter. p. 46 All members of society, regardless of economic or class status, used such magic. There have been roughly 1600 curse tablets discovered, mostly written in Greek. Of those tablets, 220 were located in Attica.see Ankarloo, Bengt. p.3 The first set of curse tablets to be discovered came from the city of Selinus in Sicily. A total of twenty-two tablets were found, mostly coming from the early fifth century, and directed toward someone that the user was suing.see Ankarloo, Bengt. p. ??? While the ancient Greeks may have feared the power of these tablets, some historians have compared the tablets to modern swearing, arguing that they were produced in a fit of anger, in envy towards a business competitor or athletic opponent, or in an unhealthy obsession toward a person of romantic interest. When research first began on the topic of curse tablets, there was serious doubt that these types of artifacts truly came from ancient Greek society.see Green, Peter. p. 44 E. R. Dodds, a professor of Greek at Oxford, was one of the first scholars to begin studying the topic of magic or superstition in ancient Greece, and others such as Peter Green have also studied this aspect of ancient Greek society. Erotic magic Scholars have debated the possible motivations for using erotic magic, including unrequited love, sexual control of the intended target, financial gain, and social advancement. The love spells used were similar in design around the Mediterranean world,See Dickie, Matthew W. pg. 565 and could be adjusted to different situations, users and intended victims. Recent scholarship has shown that women used curse tablets for erotic magic much more than originally thought, although they were still in a minority. There is also debate over the type of women that men were trying to attract with these spells. Some scholars subscribe to the idea of men trying to make fair, chaste women become filled with desire for them, while others argue that men were trying to control women whom they thought to be sexually active for their own personal benefit.see Dickie, Matthew W. pg. 568 Christopher A. Faraone considered the spells to fall into two distinct categories; spells used for inducing passion and spells used for encouraging affection.See Faraone, C.A. pg. ix Men, according to Faraone, were the primary users of the passion-inducing spells, while women were the main users of the affection spells.

August 2013, South Queensferry. The Burryman or Burry Man is the central figure in an annual ceremony or ritual, the Burryman's Parade, that takes place in the South Queensferry area of Edinburgh, on the south bank of the Firth of Forth in Scotland, on the second Friday of August. The custom is associated with, but separate from, the town's Ferry Fair.Hole, Christina (1978). A Dictionary of British Folk Customs, pp53‚Äì54, Paladin Granada, The meaning of this ceremony has long been forgotten, but it has been the cause of much speculation.The Burryman: article at Scotsman.com (accessed 21 September 2009) It is sometimes said that the custom was first recorded in 1687 (when the right to hold the Ferry Fair was originally grantedThe 1687 Proclamation of the Ferry Fair ), but it is widely believed to be much older.Flora Celtica The ceremony Burrs are the hooked, sticky flowerheads of various species of burdock. According to folklorist Christina Hole, writing in 1976, the day of the Burryman ceremony (the second Friday of August) is the day before the town's Ferry Fair. but the present Ferry Fair websiteFerry Fair website suggests that it comes at the end of a week-long fair. On the Friday morning, a local man is covered from head to ankles in burrs (the sticky flowerheads or seedheads of two species of burdock, Arctium lappa and A. minus) that grow locally. The stickiness of his burry covering means that he has to walk awkwardly, with legs apart and arms held out sideways, but he is nevertheless paraded around a seven-mile route through South Queensferry for nine hours or more.2007 Burryman route He supports his aching arms on waist-high poles decorated with flowers. Two attendants (dressed in normal clothing) guide him through the town and help him through his ordeal. The Burryman starts at the Staghead Hotel where is dressed in the burrs.Local knowledge The first stop is the former Provosts house at Villa Road then he parades round the town including visits to every public house, at each of which the Burryman is given a drink of whisky, but because of his sticky facial covering he can only drink through a straw. Local residents also give drinks of whisky so by the end of the day he is exhausted. Tradition holds that he will bring good luck to the town if they give him whisky and money, and that bad luck will result if the custom is discontinued. Only men born in the village can take on the role of the Burryman. The office is commonly held by the same person for a number of years. Alan Reid was the Burryman for 25 years (until 1999); his successor, John Nichol, took over until 2011. Other past holders of the position have included John \\"Jacko\\" Hart, Sam Corson, Arne Fredricksen and Judith McPhillips (the Wee Burry Man, 1948). Since 2012, the position has been held by Andrew Taylor. In 2005, the Burry Man inspired an avant-garde folk song by Daniel Patrick Quinn, narrated by local man Duncan Grahl.\\"The Burryman featuring Duncan Grahl\\": (accessed 25 July 2014) The Burry Man is also featured in the 2007 period crime novel The Burry Man's Day by Catriona McPherson. Details of the costume The Burryman is meant to collect his covering of burrs for himself, as well as any ferns and flowers used to decorate his costume and the two flower-covered staves (poles) that he rests his hands on. John Nichol admits to recruiting his family to help gather the large number of burrs: approximately 11,000 are needed. They are then meshed together into about 25 flat panels (A3 in size), like natural Velcro, which can be wrapped around his body on the morning of the ceremony. The process takes about half an hour.Queensferry's Burryman John Nicol's online article He dresses in several layers of clothing to protect himself from their hooks. A balaclava covers his head and face; it too is covered with burrs, leaving only small eye and mouth holes; a flower-covered bowler hat tops off the outfit.Gallery of Burryman 2009 photos (accessed 21 September 2009) He wears boots (his feet are the only parts of his body to remain uncovered by burrs) and has a broad sash around his waist, currently made from a folded Royal Standard of Scotland, displaying the top half of a red lion rampant on a bright yellow background. The choice of flag used in the outfit has varied, as a photograph from the 1970s shows the sash around the waist made from a folded Union Flag.Extract from book by WW Fyfe However, more recently no flag has been worn as the Burryman himself wanted a more traditional look as flags round the waist was a fairly new idealocal knowledge from a resident and follower Suggested origins There are many theories about the origin of the custom, what the ceremony means, and why it continues. One idea is that the parade was intended to ward off evil spirits - it can certainly ward off children, some of whom are terrified at the very sight of the Burryman, and avoid looking him in the eye. It has been suggested that he carries on a tradition thousands of years old; that he is a symbol of rebirth, regeneration and fertility (similar to the Green Man) that pre-dates almost all contemporary religions; that he is a \\"scapegoat\\" and may even originally have been a sacrificial victim. Similar ceremonies used to be held in other Scottish fishing communities, notably Buckie on the Moray Firth and Fraserburgh, to 'raise the herring' when there had been a poor fishing season. Now, only the South Queensferry ceremony remains in Scotland, though there are possible parallels with the Whittlesea Straw Bear and the Castleton Garland King (and perhaps even the Jack in the green) in England, as well as other customs elsewhere in Europe.

Overview L√Ω B√¥n (ÊùéË≥Å) was descended from Chinese refugees who fled Wang Mang's seizure of power during the interregnum between the Western and Eastern Han dynasties.Taylor (1983), p. 135Walker (2012), p. 134 Catino (2010), p. 142 Kohn (2006), p. 308 Coed√®s (1966), pp. 45‚Äì46 Lockhart (2010), p. 221 West (2009), p. 870 He was a regional magistrate of Giao Ch√¢u (‰∫§Â∑û, Chinese: Jiaozhou), an area of northern Vietnam roughly corresponding to the area of modern Hanoi. In 541, during this time China was under constant civil warfare following the Southern and Northern Dynasties Period, he became increasingly frustrated with the corruption in the government and hostility toward the local population. His friend-general Pham Tu, was an ethnic Jie, help him trained a initial army with 300 cavalry archers and started rebelling against the Liang dynasty. Upon resignation of his post he gathered the local nobility and tribes within the Red River Valley (North Vietnam) mobilized the imperial troops and naval fleet of Jiaozhou and successfully expelled the Liang administration and won a decisive battle in Hofu in summer 543. The following year in February 544, L√Ω B√≠ was declared \\"Emperor\\" by the people with the intention of demonstrating equal in power to China imperial rulers. He renamed the new kingdom \\"V·∫°n Xu√¢n\\" (Ëê¨Êò•, literally \\"Eternal Spring\\"). His imperial armies also repelled attacks from Champa in the south who had allied with Han's court at the time.  Further in his life  Map of V·∫°n Xu√¢n Kingdom L√Ω Nam ƒê·∫ø established his capital at Long Bi√™n (modern-day Hanoi), surrounded himself with effective leadership in military and administrative scholars. L√Ω Nam ƒê·∫ø was also strongly supported by famous military commander such as Ph·∫°m Tu, Tri·ªáu T√∫c, Tinh Thi·ªÅu, and Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c, (son of Tri·ªáu Tuc, later known as Tri·ªáu Vi·ªát V∆∞∆°ng). The latter emerged as a hero in Vietnamese history and eventually succeeded L√Ω Nam ƒê·∫ø as ruler in 548. L√Ω Nam ƒê·∫ø built many fortresses at strategic locations throughout V·∫°n Xu√¢n to fend off potential threats from Han in the north and from the Champa Kingdom in the south, he also established the first national university for mandarin scholars, implemented land reforms, and promoted literacy amongst the population. He laid the foundation for many reforms that modelled after the Chinese social structure. Tr·∫ßn B√° Ti√™n Stability of V·∫°n Xu√¢n did not last long and in October 544, the Liang Dynasty retaliated against V·∫°n Xu√¢n by sending 120,000 imperial troops to re-occupy the region. The Liang emperor sent one of his generals Chen Baxian (Tr·∫ßn B√° Ti√™n) and granted him sole command of the invading Liang forces. By spring of 545, Chen had marched his army into V·∫°n Xu√¢n territory and laid siege and devastation to many cities. His initial invasion was stalled by L√Ω imperial forces for months. However, in the winter of 545, Chen laid a surprised attack on the capital during the monsoon season. L√Ω Nam ƒê·∫ø's imperial forces were caught off guard and the imperial administration was forced to abandon Long Bi√™n and flee westward into the neighboring kingdom of Laos. The L√Ω imperial forces were becoming weary and exhausted and L√Ω himself was increasingly ill due to months of being exposed in the wilderness. L√Ω Nam ƒê·∫ø realized that his illness would not enable him to rally the troops and accomplish a successful resistance against the imperial Chinese forces. In February 548, he relinquished imperial authority and transferred his power to his older brother L√Ω Thi√™n B·∫£o (co- ruler from 548 until his death in 555) and Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c (r. 548‚Äì571), who was his best lieutenant and general. By April 548, after suffering from serious diseases for months, L√Ω Nam ƒê·∫ø died in Laos while fighting the Liang forces when local Laotian tribesmen assassinated him in hope for warding off the invading Liang army. His immediate successor was Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c (thereafter known as Tri·ªáu Vi·ªát V∆∞∆°ng which means Trieu Viet King). The new king continued the resistance and eventually drove the Chinese out from V·∫°n Xu√¢n in 550. Although China occupied Vietnam for approximately 1,000 years, L√Ω Nam ƒê·∫ø successfully established a Vi·ªát dynasty that gave Northern Vietnam approximately 60 years of independence in between those times.

The band was well known for their live shows, performed in full pirate regalia. The band members each portrayed crew members of the pirate ship Pollywogg, ranging from the ship's captain, Angus Bogg, to the lowly deck-hand Salty. The band enjoyed success in the Pacific Northwest as both children's entertainers, and as a band enjoyed by adults‚Äîhaving performed numerous sold-out appearances in both children's venues (such as libraries) and adult venues (such as nightclubs). They performed the same material in both types of venue; they have been quite adept at crossing the generation gap.  History  The band was formed in 1999 by Kevin Hendrickson, a musician involved with several other pirate- themed bands, most notably Pirate Jenny, and Loren Hoskins, a voice actor and comedian from the Portland area. The duo produced the band's first album, Bedtime Stories for Pirates as a concept album. The album was well-received, and is found in many pirate-themed attractions, including the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino. As demand grew, four additional musicians joined the band, including fellow Pirate Jenny alumnus Paul Iannotti, and local stage actor Andy Lindberg, who as a teenager garnered some measure of infamy for his portrayal of \\"Lardass\\" Hogan in the 1986 Rob Reiner film Stand By Me. The band has released three additional albums: Pegleg Tango (2005), Prelude to Mutiny (2006), and Emphatical Piratical (2009). Pegleg Tango was enthusiastically reviewed by Entertainment Weekly magazine. The band also played several shows in the New York City area in October 2006, culminating in an appearance opening for Harvey Danger at the famed Maxwell's nightclub in Hoboken, New Jersey. In September 2007, Lindberg went on hiatus to pursue an acting career in New York City. Hendrickson and Hoskins also wrote the music for and perform in the Disney Junior animated television series Jake and the Never Land Pirates.  Band members  The band had the following members.

History Flor de Ca√±a is made by Compa√±√≠a Licorera de Nicaragua, S.A, (CLNSA) and dates back to 1890. The company originally sought to develop a large sugarcane plantation and built the first distillery in Chichigalpa (about 120 km from Managua) at the base of the San Crist√≥bal Volcano. Compa√±√≠a Licorera de Nicaragua was founded in 1937. It was founded by the great-grandfather of the current president, who moved from Italy to Nicaragua in 1875. After building the distillery, it was not until 1937 that Flor de Ca√±a was formally introduced to the Nicaraguan market, with Flor de Ca√±a Etiqueta Amarilla and Flor de Ca√±a Etiqueta Roja being the first two flavors. In 1959 it was first exported to Venezuela, Costa Rica and other Central American countries. Between 1963 and 1965 the distillery in Chichigalpa underwent modernization updates. Eight years later a second distillery was constructed in Honduras.http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040320/NEWS/403200351/1179 p7 During the 1980s, Flor de Ca√±a was stored in large quantities due to the Nicaraguan Revolution. By 1990, Flor de Ca√±a had the largest reserve of aged rum in the world. The distillery in Chichigalpa was completely modernized in 1996. The company now sponsors the Flor de Ca√±a Open, an event on the PGA Tour Latinoam√©rica, in addition to international bar-mixing competitions. It also sponsors international fishing tournaments of the International Game Fish Association. Production Flor de Ca√±a rum is distilled five times during its production.

The company's rums are aged for up to 25 years. The contemporary line has five premium rums, two super-premium rums, and three ultra premium rums. In 2013 the company updated its bottle design, that includes examples of the rum's award wins and a volcano, intended to represent the volcanic soil of Nicaragua. The rums are distributed in forty-three countries. The Flor de Ca√±a brand symbol is present on all bottles. The logo depicts medals won by the rum and the San Cristobal Volcano. Products Flor de Ca√±a produces both white and dark rums. In 2018 it became fair trade certified through Fair Trade USA. Recognition Flor de Ca√±a is renowned as one of the best rums from Latin America, having won more than 150 international awards since 2000 and has been the most award-winning rum brand during this period.
