As a result, resource nationalism conflicts with the interests of multinational corporations. The approach of peak oil has led many governments to take ownership or control of fossil fuel reservoirs for strategic and economic reasons, although resource nationalism applies to other resources, such as metals, or in less developed nations, mining investment. It is mainly enforced as an economic policy (usually in populist governments) that relies on state ownership or control of natural resources located on their territories to advance political, social or industrial objectives. This emphasizes that resources belong to the people of the country in question first and foremost, and that state employment is the best manager of resources against privatization. A recent tide of resource nationalism appeared during the period of economic liberalisation in Latin America in the 1990s, with populations and governments looking for independence of the country in terms of export and resources. An example includes the Cochabamba Water War, a series of protests against privatization of the city's water supply that took place in Bolivia. As a result, less than six months later the government cancelled the contract. Governments that have adopted elements of resource nationalism include Bolivia under Evo Morales, Argentina under Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, and Venezuela under Hugo Ch√°vez.

The software is designed to analyze slopes using both the classic \\"method of slices\\" as well as newer stress-based methods. The program is used in the field of civil engineering to analyze levees, earth dams, natural slopes, tailings dams, heap leach piles, waste rock piles, and anywhere there is concern for mass wasting. SVSLOPE finds the factor of safety or the probability of failure for the slope. The software makes use of advanced searching methods to determine the critical failure surface. Methodology Slope stability problems in geotechnical and geo-environmental engineering involve the solution of equilibrium equations of force and moment. This is traditionally accomplished through traditional method of slices techniques or more progressive stress-based methods. SVSLOPE implements a wide variety of both limit equilibrium methods as well as newer stress-based methods. The classic Bishops, Sarma, Ordinary, Spencers, Morgenstern-Price, GLE, and US Army Corps of Engineers methods are implemented. The method of slices involves calculating the forces at the base of each slice by the weight of the slice and its height. The newer stress-based techniques use the finite element method in order to calculate more detailed information related to the stresses in the slope. With the finite element-based approach it is possible to represent more complex stress conditions in the slope. The SVSOLID software may be used in order to calculate the finite element stresses in a particular slope. The user enters geometry, material properties, and analysis constraints (such as searching methodologies) through a CAD-type graphical user interface (GUI). The results may also be viewed in the context of a graphical user interface. The geometry is simply entered as regions which may be drawn, pasted in from Excel, or imported from AutoCAD DXF files. The factor of safety for a specific failure surface is computed as the forces driving failure along the surface divided by the shear resistance of the soils along the surface. SVSLOPE implements a number of different searching algorithms to identify the critical slip surface. Algorithms for determining both circular and non- circular critical slip surfaces are implemented. Specified slip surfaces can also be employed. A library of slope stability benchmark models are distributed with the software. Features The developers of SVSLOPE have implemented all of the classic features traditionally found in slope stability software as well as an interesting list of new features. The following is a list of some of the more distinct features of SVSLOPE: * Probabilistic analysis * One-way or two-way sensitivity analysis * Spatial variability using random fields * Comprehensive searching algorithms for circular and non- circular slip surfaces * Unsaturated analysis (coupling with SVFLUX and unsaturated shear strength material properties) * New finite element based slope stability methods * Distributed with over 100 example models Classic features also supported by the software include: * Distributed loads * Point loads * Soil reinforcement * A variety of ways to represent pore-water pressures * Non-circular slip surfaces * Help system and tutorial manual * Representation of tension cracks * 17 different soil strength models References External links * SoilVision Systems Ltd.

The bank operated until 1847, when the Harrison County branch changed its charter and was renamed the Harrison National Bank. The building was built almost 40 years later by architect Charles Hamilton. Exterior The structure is built of red brick with a smooth stone foundation. The first floor, or basement, serves as storefront and can be accessed only by Main Street. The main entrance is located at the corner and is reached by a flight of stairs. The recessed door is framed by an arch with supportive Ionic columns. Lining the curve of an arch was a sign reading \\"Harrison National Bank\\", but now reads \\"Rosebud Mining Company\\", the current occupants.

He is considered one of Haiti's most important classical composers. Biography Early life A native of Port-au- Prince, he was born into a distinguished literary family, and both his parents were pianists. His grandfather, Joseph Lamothe, was also a noted instrumentalist. Lamothe had his first lessons from his mother and studied the piano and clarinet at the Institution Saint Louis de Gonzague in his native Port-au-Prince where he exhibited exceptional technical and compositional abilities from a young age. In 1910, German merchants in Haiti recognised his talents and funded a scholarship for him to go and continue his studies in Paris, France. There he would study under Louis Diemer at the Paris Conservatory. Louis Di√©mer, Lamothe's mentor in Paris Lamothe returned to Haiti in 1911, remaining there for the rest of his life; he taught and gave private recitals on the piano in his home. He gained a reputation for reciting the works of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, his favourite composer, and he became known as the \\"Black Chopin\\", particularly amongst music scholars and middle-upper class men in Haiti. On one instance Lamothe was invited to perform an event at the Rex Theatre named ‚ÄúUn Chopin Noir‚Äù (A Black Chopin) to commemorate the anniversary of the death of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. Lamothe recited, among others, Chopin's Polonaise in A Flat. Compositions As a composer, Lamothe wrote exclusively for his own instrument, and became known especially for his songs and short piano pieces. Lamothe's repertoire included a range of m√©ringue, from the most formal, elite-oriented forms to the m√©ringue of the low orders. He was not only influenced by traditional European classical music, but he was influenced by local traditions including Haitian Vodou ceremonial music and carnivals and Haitian peasant culture and influences which reflected a shared African heritage. One scholar has described Lamothe's repertoire as \\"predominantly classical in form, but creole in inspiration. Another musical scholar, Claude Carr√© of the online magazine Boutoures has described Lamothe as \\"representing the nationalist movement in Haitian classical music\\" and being \\"an emblematic figure, a piano virtuoso and a performer of Chopin, who left us a number of important compositions for piano.\\" Lamothe's drew upon influences from Haitian vodou ceremonial music in his compositions His fusion of styles and class influences in his music were regarded by scholars as reducing the polarisation in classes in Haiti in the early to mid-twentieth- century Haiti and giving them a unique shared identity through a musical spectrum. One of his notable works is entitled, La Dangereuse, a slow tempo piece with gentle, restrained dynamics, was warmly received by the Haitian aristocracy. In 1934, Lamothe won a Port-au-Prince city council competition for his \\"Carnival m√©ringue\\", which he entitled Nibo. Well received by all walks of society in Haiti, Nibo became known as a Liberation Anthem. a piece to mark the withdrawal of American forces from Haiti in August of that year. Later life and post-recognition Later in life, Lamothe encountered some serious financial problems, largely due to the fact he had not published many works internationally, only two, and even those were limited to Berlin and Paris, so he was not generating enough income to sustain a living. On 9 February 1944, he was forced to sell up his home that he had lived in much of his life, but his continued musical status amongst the elite in Haiti meant that enough money was raised to aid him in buying a new home. Lamothe later went on to become Chief of Music of the Republic of Haiti. He died in Port-au- Prince in 1953. Although little of his music was published even in his native Haiti during his life, after his death his family collected his manuscripts and had them printed privately. A collection of his pieces was published in Port-au-Prince in 1955, entitled simply, Musique de Ludovic Lamothe. In 2001, a CD recording of Lamothe was published on the IFA Music Records label, released in 2001 featuring some of his pieces, the Ballade in A Minor, Danza No. 1 (La Habanera), Evocation, and Danse Espagnole No. 4, performed by Latino-Caribbean pianist, Charles P. Phillips. In 2006, a book entitled Vodou Nation: Haitian Art Music and Cultural Nationalism by the Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology cited numerous examples of Lamothe's compositions to illustrate his cultural contribution to Vodou music. They cited in particular, La Dangereuse, Nibo, Sous la Tonnelle, Loco and Sobo.

On the run securities are generally more liquid and trade at a premium to other securities. Other, older issues are referred to as off the run securities, and trade at a discount to on the run securities.  Examples  United States Treasury securities have periodic auctions; the treasury of a given tenor, say 30 years, which has most recently been auctioned is the on-the-run security, while all older treasuries of that tenor are off-the-run. For credit default swaps, the 5-year contract sold at the most recent IMM date is the on-the-run security; it thus has a remaining maturity of between 4 years, 9 months and 5 years. A number of indices only hold on-the-run contracts, to ease trading.  Trades  When a new security is issued, becoming the new on-the-run security, buying the new contract and selling the old one is called rolling the contract. A convergence trade involves the difference in price between the on- the-run and the most recent off-the-run instrument: for long tenors, these are virtually the same instrument, and in any event, an on-the-run instrument becomes off-the-run upon the issue of a newer instrument. Thus, if the basis (difference in price) between an on-the-run and most recent off-the-run instrument becomes large, one may buy the off-the-run and sell the on-the-run in anticipation of the basis shrinking. This trade, for 30-year treasuries, is notable for having been practiced by Long-Term Capital Management.

It is the tenth installment in the NBA 2K franchise and the successor to NBA 2K8. It was released in 2008 for PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows. Kevin Garnett of the Boston Celtics is the cover athlete of the game. NBA 2K9 is the predecessor to NBA 2K10 in the NBA 2K series. Like past games in the series, NBA 2K9 simulates the experience of the sport of basketball, and more specifically, the National Basketball Association. Players play NBA games with any team of their choosing, and may customize many different aspects to alter the play style and overall presentation. Several single- and multiplayer game modes are present, including season, online, and quick play, as well as the ability to create new teams and players. NBA 2K9 received positive reviews from critics upon release. Most positive comments were concerning the overall gameplay, and the aesthetical presentation; some called NBA 2K9 the \\"best basketball game around\\". Some criticism was directed at the game for what some saw as having a lack of new features. By July 2009, the game had sold over 2 million copies. Gameplay NBA 2K9 is a basketball simulation video game based on the National Basketball Association. Like past games in the series, NBA 2K9 simulates the experience of the sport of basketball, and more specifically, the NBA. Players play NBA games with any real life or custom team, and can customize many aspects, such as camera angles, the presentation of players, the sound levels, and the level of realism. Several different game modes are present, such as Association 2.0 (a season mode), 5-on-5 online multiplayer, mini games, and quick games of varying levels of competition. Like other NBA 2K games, NBA 2K9 is marketed as being as realistic as the actual NBA, with all the things featured in NBA games, such as commentary, halftime shows, replays, crowds, and real player movement, among many other things. Another feature heavily touted before release was the game's HD visuals, which was said to have been \\"drastically improved\\". Kevin Harlan and Clark Kellogg are the commentators with Cheryl Miller being a sideline reporter. Development Kevin Garnett is the cover athlete of the game. NBA 2K9s soundtrack consists of 24 licensed songs as well as one original song. The game was released worldwide in 2008 for PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows. NBA 2K9 is the first game in the NBA 2K series to be released on PC.

In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three sevens and one six for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions; and two sixes, one seven, and one five for the PlayStation 2 version. David Ellis of 1UP.com particularly praised the customization aspects of the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions and the levels of realism, but disliked the unnecessarily complicated control scheme. Ellis also spoke positively of the online modes and the Living Rosters feature. Ellis summed up his review by stating: \\"The NBA 2K9 team has refined last year's game and added several new features that change the way videogame basketball is played. While it's not perfect, 2K9s certainly headed toward another title run.\\" Matt Bertz of Game Informer said that the concepts of the same console versions \\"continue to refine [the series] with the deepest franchise mode in any sports game\\", called the crowd animations \\"amazing\\", liked the broadcast team, complimented most aspects of the controls, and said the game is \\"the best basketball game around for hoops aficionados\\". Bertz stated: \\"With its realistic animations, solid controls, and ambitious Association mode, NBA 2K9 makes its title run once again. But the competition is stiffening, and next year needs to bring significant leaps forward with online play and the low- post game if 2K wants to make it 10 in a row.\\" Aaron Thomas of GameSpot praised the \\"Living Rosters\\", \\"excellent\\" gameplay, and the presentation of the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions. Thomas said: \\"It's disappointing that there aren't more noteworthy additions to this year's game. Living rosters and five- on-five play are nice, but their appeal is limited. That said, there's very little not to like about NBA 2K9. Player animations are outstanding, Association mode is deep, online options are plentiful, and the gameplay is terrific. If you're a baller, this is the game for you.\\" IGN's Nate Ahearn said of the PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions: \\"NBA 2K9 is [a] basketball game for the purists out there and has plenty for diehard basketball fans to enjoy. At a price of $19.99 I can almost forgive the absence of multiplayer, especially when you consider how much game there is still is to play. There are tidbits built in to appease casual fans, but there¬ís no question that with things like Bird Years making their way into this year¬ís game that 2K9 is made for aficionados. Even still, anyone who has seen a pro game will be able to find the similarities and the finite details that make NBA 2K9 the best game in town.\\" GameTrailers complimented the PS3 version's overall presentation, crowd animations, overall gameplay, and CPU, but disliked the game's lack of an identity, the menu designs, commentary, online technical issues, and the introduction of some \\"silly\\" features. The review stated: \\"The NBA 2K series has seen modest improvements since NBA 2K7, primarily due to the level of quality achieved at such an early phase in the next-gen life cycle. Because of this, casual hoops players aren't going to be wowed with this latest iteration of NBA 2K9, but it's meant to satisfy those who live and breathe basketball, as the improvements in the AI and atmosphere alone are sure to tickle the inner twine of dedicated fans.\\" Sales By July 2009, NBA 2K9 had sold over 2 million copies across all platforms.

It can also be used as a measure of the health of water in natural bodies such as rivers or lakes, or in man made water reservoirs.Glossary of terms for water health measurement at the Sabine River Authority of Texas The term is used widely in waste treatment and water purification systems. Ammonia can directly poison humans and upset the equilibrium of water systems. The values of ammoniacal nitrogen in water or waste liquids are measured in milligram per liter and are used for specifying water treatment systems and facilities. The typical output of liquid manure from a dairy farm, after separation from the solids is 1600 mg NH3-N /L.Wastewater Treatment to Minimize Nutrient Delivery from Dairy Farms to Receiving Waters a report for NOAA Sewage treatment plants, receiving lower values, typically remove 80% and more of input ammonia and reach NH3-N values of 250 mg/L or less. The ammonium nitrogen value is also used in the context of properly designed landfill systems, where the leachate is being pumped to the surface and treated before it enters the ground water, testing the quality of the water exiting the treatment system. The term NH3-N removal is also commonly used in scientific publications as a short way to depict Ammonia in water, and not the measure of its quantity.The terms NH3-N removal, and NH3-N fixation show up in over 1000 relevant results in web searches. Structure and Basic Chemical Properties Ammonium and ammonia forms of nitrogen compounds  Ammonia and Ammonium  Ammonium is an ionized form of ammonia. The chemical structure for ammonium is NH. The chemical structure for ammonia is NH3. Ammonia is highly soluble in water. Ammonia reacts with water (H2O) and forms the ionized form: :NH3 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üî NH + OH‚àí The reaction is reversible. The hydroxide ion (OH‚àí) plus NH forms NH3 \\\\+ H2O. The percentage of ammonia increases with increasing alkalinity of dissolved ammonium in water. Ammonium ions are formed with increasing acidity of dissolved ammonia in water. Ammonia is toxic to fish and humans. The toxicity is decreased with lower alkalinity and increases with higher alkalinity as ammonium is converted to ammonia.  Ammonia and mineral forms of Nitrogen  There are 3 main forms of nitrogen: * Molecular nitrogen * Mineral nitrogen * Organic nitrogen =Molecular nitrogen= Molecular nitrogen is the gas form of nitrogen in the atmosphere. The chemical structure for nitrogen gas is N2. =Mineral nitrogen= The mineral forms of nitrogen are: * Nitrate with the chemical structure of NO * Nitrite with the chemical structure of NO * Ammonium ions, with the chemical structure of NH Ammoniums ions are nitrified and are converted by microorganisms into nitrate.

It is located in the San Benancio Canyon. History and etymology The region was named for San Benancio Gulch which is the small canyon that forms the majority of the region. A map dated 1834 lists the region as \\"Canada de San Benancio\\". The Spanish name most likely refers to one of four saints venerated with the name Venantius. San Benancio was the inspiration for \\"Las Pasturas del Cielo,\\" the fictional setting in John Steinbeck‚Äôs Pastures of Heaven. A Salinas native, Steinbeck spent time in his youth within San Benancio, specifically Castle Rock near the base of the Canyon, and accurately described the region in Pastures of Heaven: Geography and climate While it has no official boundaries, and addresses bear Salinas as the city, the colloquial place-name ‚ÄúSan Benancio‚Äù refers to homes and businesses residing on or directly reached by San Benancio Road. This includes the Ambler Park and Harper Canyon regions found along the road. The road itself is located along the Monterey-Salinas highway (California State Route 68) approximately 5 miles from Salinas and 15 miles from Monterey. The land falls under the jurisdiction of the Corral de Tierra Oaks Subdivision of Monterey County. The walls of San Benancio Canyon have an elevation of 400 ft and run adjacent to Toro Creek, a small tributary to the Salinas River which is located 4 miles south. The canyon is home to a number of California Live Oak Trees and various types of wild sage brush and grass. San Benancio enjoys the relatively warm climate of Salinas Valley most of the year, but can experience very low temperatures (for the area) during the winter. Its location within a small canyon engenders the area to late sunrises and early sunsets, but the high hills around the area shelter the homes from winds and San Benancio can often be found at a much higher temperature than urban Salinas on warm days. The canyon is home to a wide array of wildlife as well including deer, hawks, condors, wild pigs, California quail and a large population of wild turkeys, which, at their own peril, traverse San Benancio Road in the early mornings. Government At the county level, San Benancio is represented on the Monterey County Board of Supervisors by Supervisor Dave Potter. In the California State Senate, San Benancio is in . In the California State Assembly, it is split between , and . In the United States House of Representatives, San Benancio is in Education and recreation San Benancio is served by the Washington Union School District. San Benancio Middle School which serves a little over 300 students in the 6th, 7th, and 8th grade, is located in San Benancio. The school was rated 9 out of 10 by the ‚ÄúGreat Schools‚Äù website in 2007. The region is also served by Titus Park, a private Swim and Tennis club located along San Benancio Road. The pool remains open daily from June to September and hours are dictated by weather.

As an educational nonprofit, the IRC works in partnership with a range of businesses, universities, community organizations, K-12 schools, and other interested individuals to grow a global perspective and find international connections within the Greater Kansas City metropolitan area. The IRC works to foster interest in and understanding of international affairs among the citizens of Kansas City through the development of various programs and events, such as its Global Experience Series, Berkley Lectures, WorldQuest, Great Decisions, and many others. As a membership organization, the IRC welcomes individuals and families, businesses, universities, and other organizations to join as IRC members in order to help sustain global-affairs education in the Kansas City community and receive various benefits. Mission The mission of the International Relations Council (IRC) is to bring a global perspective to the Greater Kansas City community through strategic partnerships with businesses, universities, community organizations, and K-12 schools. The IRC brings world leaders and dignitaries to the metro region to share their international experiences, hosts forums for high-school students to interact with and learn from foreign-policy experts, and creates opportunities for area business leaders to strengthen relationships abroad. The IRC emphasizes that promoting global awareness and understanding ultimately strengthens and supports communities.  History  The International Relations Council was founded in late December 1954 by Eliot Berkley, who served as executive director of the IRC for nearly forty years and, later, as chairman of the IRC Academy and lifetime board member of the IRC. After graduating from Harvard University in 1947, Eliot earned an M.A. (1949) and Ph.D. (1952) from Princeton University. Returning to his hometown, Eliot taught history and government at the University of Kansas City, now UMKC. He then taught social science at the Kansas City Art Institute, where he later served as vice president for development from 1960 to 1961 and dean of the college from 1961 to 1965. As an advocate of citizen involvement in the foreign policy process, Dr. Berkley served as executive director of the International Relations Council for nearly forty years and, later, as chairman of the IRC Academy and lifetime board member of the IRC. For many years, his wife Marcia worked side by side with Eliot, hosting dinners and meetings in their home. Eliot died in 2012 but is still remembered fondly by business, community, and academic leaders ¬ª for his inspirational passion for global issues. The IRC welcomed Eleanor Roosevelt as its first speaker in January 1955. Since then, a wide range of legislators, professors, journalists, diplomats, and other global-affairs experts have visited Kansas City to share their perspective and expertise. These notable guests include Henry Kissinger (1975), Jim Lehrer (1986), Robert J. Eaton (1993), Madeleine Albright (2006), Condoleezza Rice (2010), and Janet Napolitano (2014). Since its beginning, the IRC has grown from a small \\"kitchen table\\" gathering to an educational organization with a large number of Kansas City area members. With Matthew Hughes serving as the current executive director, the IRC warmly welcomes involvement in IRC events and programs from citizens of the Greater Kansas City area.

The first IRC Networking Hour of 2017 took place on March 22, where attendees took a visit to Burns & McDonnell, an engineering, architecture, and consulting firm with both domestic and international projects. On August 2, attendees learned about the nationwide work of Commerce Bank and had plenty of time to network. At the final IRC Networking Hour of 2017 on October 9, attendees had a chance to meet employees of Bio-Microbics, a manufacturer of wastewater treatment systems with over 60,000 installations in over 70 countries. The IRC sees great value in allowing members of the Kansas City community the chance to network with internationally interested organizations, as it creates opportunities for further global connections within Kansas City. IRC Lecture Series IRC Lecture Series bring dignitaries, foreign-policy experts, and regional leaders together to discuss, debate, and engage the Kansas City area community in issues of international scope and local relevance. Some of the IRC's recent programs include: * Where Does Venezuela Go From Here? with David Smolansky, the youngest mayor in the Venezuela's history, living in exile since September 2017 * An Evening with H.E. Dr. Asad Majeed Khan, Amb. of Pakistan to the U.S. * Populism and Nationalism on the Ride: A German Perspective with Stefan Schl√ºter Speakers Bureau The International Relations Council's Speakers Bureau is a collection of IRC members willing to share their expertise and experiences with the Greater Kansas City area. Speakers have knowledge of the historical and contemporary aspects of specific countries, foreign policy, geography, and culture. The members of the Bureau don‚Äôt charge a fee for their speaking time and are available to the Greater Kansas City area (but it is ultimately their decision where to travel). WorldQuest Each year, more than 200 business professionals, academic faculty, community members, and students participate in a fun and interactive global trivia competition. It is a 6 round competition, each round consisting of 10 questions. In the past, categories have included: current events, history, geography, identifications (visual or aural), potpourri 1 and potpourri 2 (potpourri questions allow for topics like food, language, culture). Teams of eight compete to show their knowledge of global affairs, geography, world languages, and more. The winning team takes home the traveling trophy, while second- and third-place teams win valuable prizes. Great Decisions Great Decisions is a program produced by the Foreign Policy Association and offered in Kansas City through the IRC. Across Kansas and Missouri, people participating in Great Decisions gather in homes, libraries, and community centers to discuss some of the most pressing issues facing our world. Groups receive and study Great Decisions briefing books, which are well-researched, written materials that help guide discussion throughout the year. Each discussion is led by a Discussion Group Leader. However, participants play the most important role, and their interest, enthusiasm, and commitment ultimately determine the success of the group. Each participant's point of view carries equal weight and everyone is encouraged to share opinions and ideas. The topics change annually, and these discussions strengthen people's understanding of global issues and build connections in the Kansas City community. Global Experience Series Global Experience programs give participants of all ages, interests, and backgrounds the chance to explore how international Kansas City is while answering two key questions ‚Äì What's your global story? Do you get the chance to share it? Often free or low-cost, Global Experience events range from visits to internationally themed restaurants and other outings to film screenings and discussions on timely global issues. By sharing their diverse knowledge and insights, hosts and participants provide a deeper look into Kansas City's vibrant international community. School programs The IRC devotes a large portion of its resources to programs for teachers and students. IRC programs aim to promote global and cross-cultural awareness and to inspire a passion for international studies. Your Global Future Away from the borders and coasts, Kansas City-area students are often surprised to find just how many international academic and professional opportunities await them after high school. Your Global Future is a unique college and career fair that will take place at Union Station's Grand Plaza on October 16, 2018.

The program will be underwritten by support from the participating organizations and Kansas City-area donors to ensure that attendance is completely cost-free for teachers and students. Sponsor packages to increase visibility and impact are available, and schools will be eligible to receive up to $200 to offset the cost of bus transportation. Eliot S.

International Classroom Partnership Program (ICPP) The ICPP is a program which sends international students from several Kansas City area colleges and universities to visit elementary schools in order to share their life and culture with school children. International college students share facts about language, dress, and etiquette of their home countries with American students. The program aims to dispel stereotypes of other nations while sparking an interest in foreign languages and cultures in elementary-aged children. The International Classroom Partnership Program ended in 2010. Global Honors Evening In 1984, the IRC began its annual Awards Banquet, now known as the Global Honors Evening. Each year, the IRC recognizes individuals or organizations for a variety of contributions ‚Äì to foreign policy and global affairs, to international commerce, or to the Kansas City community.

Biography Early life and education Aryeh Carmell was born in London, England, in 1917, to a Russian family of Jews. He was educated at public (i.e. State) schools, and then by private tutors. His primary tutor was Rav Dessler, one of the outstanding Torah scholars of the generation, who later became Rosh Kollel at Gateshead in the early 1940s, and then (in the late 1940s) went on to serve as Mashgiach Ruchani at the Ponevezh Yeshiva in Bnei Brak. Career Rabbi Carmell was a successful mortgage broker and real estate developer, living and working in London, England. His passion, however, was Torah study. In addition to giving regular classes in Torah at his home in the Stamford Hill neighborhood, he founded the Jewish Scholarship Center, the British Shabbos Observance Bureau and the Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists. He was in constant communication with the prominent rabbis of the day. He also co-authored a Hebrew-language book entitled \\"Michtav Me'Eliyahu\\" (\\"A letter from Eliyahu\\"), which was the first written exposition of the philosophical teachings of Rabbi Dessler. \\"Michtav Me'Eliyahu\\" became a very popular work of philosophy and ethics, and was translated into several languages. Rabbi Carmell personally translated it into English (under the name \\"Strive for Truth!\\") and into modern Hebrew (the original work containing too much Aramaic for the average Hebrew speaker). In addition to Rabbi Dessler, Rabbi Carmell saw Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch as an important influence, and based his Masterplan on the concept of Rabbi Hirsch's Horeb. In 1972, Rabbi Carmell and his family moved to Jerusalem, where he taught at the Jerusalem Institute (Dvar Yerushalayim) and elsewhere and where he continued to write and publish. In addition to \\"Strive for Truth!\\", he authored \\"Challenge: Torah views on science and its problems\\", \\"Aids to Talmud Study\\",Later editions of this publication were called Aiding Talmud Study to avoid mentioning AIDS. and \\"Masterplan: Judaism, its program, meaning and goals\\", and edited \\"Encounter: Essays on Torah and modern life\\", all published by Feldheim Publishers.

He was born in Chengxuan Village, Luoyang in present-day Henan Province. According to legend Su Qin was a disciple of Guiguzi, the founder of the School of Diplomacy. He was the chief advocate of the Vertical Alliance system, which sought to create an alliance of the other states against the state of Qin. The opposing theory, \\"Horizontal Alliance\\" () supported alliances with the State of Qin. After finishing his studies with Guiguzi, Su Qin travelled for several years and on his return lamented that \\"My wife doesn't recognize me as her husband, my sister-in-law doesn't recognize me as her brother-in-law, and my parents don't recognize me as their son!\\". All these misfortunes he blamed on himself and he thereafter shut himself in his room to study. To prevent falling asleep from long hours of study, he would stab himself in the thigh with a sharp instrument. This practice gave rise to part of a Chinese idiom or \\"chengyu\\" which means \\"to study assiduously and tirelessly\\". Years later, when Su Qin returned with full honors following his success with the Vertical Alliance system, his family received him with great reverence, causing him to remark on their change of behavior towards him, leading to the rise of another Chinese idiom which means \\"a change of attitude from arrogance to respect\\". At his most brilliant Su Qin persuaded the leaders of the six kingdoms of Qi, Chu, Yan, Han, Zhao and Wei to unite against the Qin state through the use of his splendid rhetoric and thereafter wore robes decorated with the insignia of the six states. The allies of the Vertical Alliance advanced on the State of Qin but were easily defeated due to internal discord between the former enemies. One theory suggests that he and Zhang Yi mutually reinforced each other's viewpoints in order to achieve their personal goals. Canvassing the Six States This period of canvassing is one of the most debated issues in Chinese History. Modern day verification of Su Qin's biography in the Records of the Grand Historian and the Strategems of the Warring States suggests that the content relating to Su Qin in the former work was actually forged by later authors.„ÄäÂè≤ËÆ∞¬∑ËãèÁß¶Âàó‰º†„Äã(Records of the Grand Historian, Biography of Su Qin)„ÄäÊàòÂõΩÁ∫µÊ®™ÂÆ∂‰π¶„Äã(Records of the Vertical and Horizontal Alliance Schools of Thought) A wasted visit to the Qin State When Su Qin arrived in Qin, the state's ruler Duke Xiao of Qin had just died. His successor King Huiwen of Qin, destested the political reformer Shang Yang of whom the former Duke had been an avid supporter and promptly had him executed. King Huiwen also hated talented foreigners such that Su Qin made no headway. Negotiations with the Yan State Su Qin told Marquis Wen, the ruler of the Yan State that the threat posed by the Zhao State was greater than that from the Qin State and that he should form an alliance with the State of Qi. As a result, Su Qin came to be highly regarded in the Yan State. Negotiations with the Zhao State Su Qin informed the Marquis of Zhao that his territory lay in a crucial position, slightly offset from the other warring states but ultimately disadvantageous. He suggested that because of this, in an alliance with the other powers, the Zhao State would effectively hold the balance of power. Much impressed by the idea, the Zhao ruler rewarded Su Qin financially and invited him to venture forth and discuss an alliance with the other states. Negotiations with the Han State Su Qin angered King Xuan of Han and made him focus on the Vertical Alliance. Negotiations with the Wei State Encouraging the selfishness of the Wei officials, Su Qin persuaded King Xiang of Wei to concentrate on the Vertical Alliance. Negotiations with the Qi State Su Qin made it clear that it was impossible for the Qin State to cross Zhao and Wei and attack Qi. As a result, to the great shame of Su Qin, the Qi State pledged allegiance to the Qin. Negotiations with the Chu State Su Qin told King Wei of the Chu that the other six warring states had already formed an alliance. King Wei refused to join and was inevitably attacked by the State of Qin. At the end of this period of canvassing, Su Qin became chief administrator of the Vertical Alliance and wore the insignia of the six member nations. After he became famous, he returned to his hometown in a blaze of glory. His parents welcomed him thirty li from home, his sister-in-law crawled like a snake whilst the surprise showed on his wife but she dared not look at him, her former stubbornness having become respect. Once more Su Qin lamented \\"the parents are poor but not the son\\". Although already an official of the six nation alliance, Marquis Su of Zhao appointed Su Qin ruler of Wu'an in modern-day Henan Province. According to the records of the Vertical Alliance, the Qin State went into decline and would not dare cross the strategic Hangu Pass for a further fifteen years. Defeat of the Vertical Alliance and the death of Su Qin The six nation Vertical Alliance started out with each member state pursuing their own interests and as a result the foundations were shallow. A punitive expedition mounted by the State of Qin against the states of Qi, Wei and Zhao brought the end of the Vertical Alliance; Su Qin left the Zhao State and the alliance disintegrated. The Qi State took advantage of the Yan State and installed a new monarch, King Yi, as well occupying ten cities which the King of Wei asked Su Qin to get back. Su Qin petitioned the King of Qi thus: \\"The King of Yan is a kinsman of the Qi State and you have snatched his territory. This is bound to draw the elite troops of the Qin State so you must return these cities!\\" After the Marquis Wen of Yan died, King Yi ascended the throne. Su Qin had an affair with the late Marquis‚Äô widow and when King Yi learned about the affair, Su Qin, fearing that he might be punished, subsequently left the Yan State and went to Qi where he obtained an important position from King Xuan. When Xuan died, King Min ascended the throne and Su Qin vied with the ministers of state for the monarch‚Äôs favor. The ministers tried to assassinate Su Qin and he was seriously injured; the Qi king tried to arrest the culprits but failed to do so. On his deathbed Su Qin gave the King a plan to arrest the assassins: after his death, Su Qin was posthumously accused of treason and his body was torn limb from limb in the town square. This prompted the Su Qin‚Äôs would-be assassins to reveal themselves, and they were subsequently executed. Afterwards, Su Qin‚Äôs spies leaked information to the Qi State provoking the further hatred and anger of the Yan State. Contemporary verification of Su Qin's real identity In 1973, at the Mawangdui in Changsha, a number of silk manuscripts were unearthed. Once they were collated these were dubbed the \\"Records of the Vertical and Horizontal Alliance Schools of Thought‚Äù during the Warring States period\\". The documents consist of a total of twenty-seven chapters divided into three parts. The first, consisting of fourteen chapters, contains Su Qin's correspondence and conversations and provides information from which the historical truth regarding the \\"Strategies of the Warring States‚Äù may be discerned and errors in Su Qin‚Äôs biography in the \\"Records of the Grand Historian\\" identified. According to this written evidence, Su Qin‚Äôs era followed that of Zhang Yi, during the reign of King Zhao of Yan. In conjunction with Gong Sun Yan, Su Qin continued Zhang Yi's mutual confrontation with the Horizontal Alliance of Xi Shou. Su Qin had four older brothers: Su Dai, Su Li, Su Bi and Su Hu. Under his teacher Yu Qi, Su Qin studied all aspects of the operations of the Vertical Alliance and the Horizontal Alliance. He also pored over the books in Yu Qi‚Äôs collection and found one titled \\"Minister Yin Fu‚Äôs Plan\\", which Su Qin studied hard for many years, and accepted that its methods would be enough to gain the support of the reigning monarch. After King Zhao of Yan (312‚Äì279 BC) ascended to the throne, the state suffered upheaval and bloodshed so the king, planning to strengthen his state and avenge former humiliation, summoned his sages. Su Qin immediately left Zhou and travelled to the Yan. For King Zhao of Yan, Su Qin carried out his first meritorious service by petitioning King Xuan of Qi to return the ten cities he had previously snatched. The Yan sent a prince as hostage to the Qi with Su Qin acting as envoy. This was in the seventh year of the reign of King Min of Qi, 294 BCE when the government of the Qi was presided over by Lord Mengchang. Su Qin was treated well in Qi and was on friendly terms with Lord Mengchang before his return to Yan. In 292 BCE, the tripartite forces of Qi, Zhao and Qin were using all their efforts to fight over territory belonging to the State of Song. Su Qin suggested a plan to King Zhao of Yan whilst guaranteeing that he could be \\"trusted as much as Wei Sheng\\"According to Chinese folklore, Wei Sheng was a young man who agreed to meet his sweetheart under a bridge one day. He waited and waited for her to no avail. Eventually, the tide came in and drowned Wei Sheng. His name is thus used as a metaphor for someone who will keep their word no matter what happens. and that details of his secret meetings would go with him to the grave. Thereafter, Su Qin managed to drive a wedge between Qi and Zhao. Qi wiped out Song, which severely weakened Qi such that the Vertical Alliance of the other five states attacked. When Yue Yi defeated Qi, King Min of Qi adjudged Su Qin guilty of dissention and had him torn limb from limb in public. Afterwards Zou Yang said \\"Su Qin trusted nothing under heaven but he kept his promises to the State of Yan. Sima Qian also commented, \\"Su Qin undertook a strategy of sowing dissention which led to his execution and all under heaven now mock him\\". In 1972, circumstantial evidence unearthed from the number one grave at Yinque Mountain, Linyi Prefecture, Shandong Province provided Han Dynasty bamboo slips inscribed with \\"The Art of War\\" by Sun Tzu. The historian Li Ling mentions this in his simplified version \\"Sun Tzu\\" in the \\"Espionage\\" chapter, viz \\"When the Zhou flourished, Lu Ya was in Yin\\" followed by the sentence, \\"When Yan flourished, Su Qin was in Qi\\". Li Ling believes that this \\"Sun Tzu\\" is not the same as the one handed down to later generations and is clearly the history of the late Warring States period.ÊùéÈõ∂Ôºö„ÄäÂê¥Â≠ôÂ≠êÂèëÂæÆ„ÄãÔºå‰∏≠Âçé‰π¶Â±Ä1997Âπ¥6ÊúàÁ¨¨1ÁâàÔºåÁ¨¨43È°µÁöÑÊ≥®Èáä24ÔºåÁ¨¨167È°µ„ÄÇÂèàËßÅÊùéÈõ∂Ôºö„ÄäÂ≠ôÂ≠êÂè§Êú¨Á†îÁ©∂„ÄãÔºåÂåó‰∫¨Â§ßÂ≠¶Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æ1995Âπ¥ÔºåÁ¨¨239È°µËá≥Á¨¨253È°µ„ÄÇLi Ling \\"Sun Tzu ‚Äì Decline of the Southern States\\", Zhonghua Publishing, 1 June 1997, p43 marginal note 24 ‚Äì p167.

In 1775 it was nearly as large as Tunstall, and grew further during the 19th century.Goldenhill Staffordshire Past Track, accessed 29 September 2016. It is thought there was pottery manufacture of coarse ware in Goldenhill during the 16th century. At the beginning of the 19th century there were six potteries works. During the century pottery manufacture became more concentrated in Tunstall, which had 13 potteries by 1834, compared with two in Goldenhill; in 1863 there were 19 potteries in Tunstall and one in Goldenhill, which closed soon afterwards. There was coal mining on a small scale in the 1700s. James Brindley, builder of the Harecastle Tunnel in the 1770s, built a branch canal from the tunnel to an underground wharf of a colliery in Goldenhill in which he had a share; by 1820 this had become unsafe and was closed. The Goldenhill Colliery, in Colclough Lane, excavating coal and ironstone, was owned by Robert Williamson in the mid 19th century. It was still operating in the 1920s, but was closed by 1931. The Potteries Waterworks Company, formed in 1847, supplied water to Goldenhill and Kidsgrove by pumping water from a steam pumping plant in Tunstall, built in 1854, to a new reservoir on the higher ground at Goldenhill. The Potteries Loop Line, built in 1873, was extended to Goldenhill in 1874 and Goldenhill railway station was opened.

Worth, Texas) is a children's recording artist based in Lincoln, Nebraska. Biography The following was obtained from Mike's biography: Mike was painfully shy until is mother coaxed him out of his shell with an ice cream scoop. Handing Mike the utensil as she cooked supper, she told Mike to pretend it was a microphone and entertain her. He did. For hours that night‚Äîand for countless nights, thereafter‚ÄîMike performed silly songs and poems to his mother. It's safe to say that Mike came out of his shell, and decades later it‚Äôs difficult to imagine Mike as anything but a performer. But he claims that that shy little boy still lives inside, which helps him to relate to children‚Äîshy ones, as well as not-so-shy ones‚Äîbetter. Throughout the 1990s, Mennard performed contemporary gospel music extensively throughout the United States. He produced two recordings with Eden Records, \\"Grace (and Other Stuff)\\" and \\"Life With a View.\\" But Mike‚Äôs first musical love has been children‚Äôs music‚Äîor as Mike calls it, ‚Äúfamily music.‚Äù He incorporated his ‚Äúfamily music‚Äù in all of his gospel concerts until soon those songs became his most requested. Concert-goers were disappointed when those fun, zany songs were not available on CDs or cassettes. In 2004, Mike solved that dilemma with the release of \\"Something's Rotting in the Fridge.\\" Mike has turned his full creative talents toward storytelling and educating through music. He is passionate about writing and performing music and poetry for children (and their families). His shows have become popular attractions, from classrooms and libraries to state fairs and concert halls. As an English professor at Union College in Lincoln, Nebraska, he teaches college students about the values of poetry and music, yet he still believes that one is never too young to learn to appreciate rhythm and rhyme (and wacky humor!). Promoting literacy through music, Mike travels to state reading conferences across the US, entertaining teachers and speaking with them about the importance of keeping rhythm and nonsense alive in the classroom. In 2004, Mike Mennard recorded his first children's album and has been busy ever since. He has produced six albums and one stage musical (play). His music is family friendly, with humor that adults, children, and educators alike appreciate. Targeting elementary-aged kids, Mike‚Äôs sense of humor and interactive performances have won the hearts of critics and families world-wide. No musical style holds Mike prisoner‚Äîon any of his albums you‚Äôre likely to find rock, rap, bluegrass, hip-hop, opera, lullabies, and everything in between. Perhaps the one thing that distinguishes Mike's work is its interplay between music and poetry. Each album is part music, part poetry, all original; and this may explain why some CDs have as many as 51 tracks.

Aznar was part of a radical element within the followers of Francisco Franco and at times represented a challenge to his leadership. Early years The son of the academic Severino Aznar Embid, Aznar studied medicine at the Universidad Central de Madrid, where his father was a sociology lecturer.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1990, p. 16 He specialised in haematology and would ultimately serve as Chief Professor of the Central Laboratory and the Haematological Service. Aznar's political involvement also began in his student days and in 1935 he was the founder and leader of the Falangist student union, the Sindicato Espa√±ol Universitario.E. de Blaye, Franco and the Politics of Spain, Penguin Books, 1976, p. 457 Known as a burly adventurer who held the Greco-Roman wrestling title in Castille,Stanley G. Payne, Fascism in Spain, 1923-1977, 2000, p. 164 he was appointed chief of the Madrid section of the Falange militia and took part in several bloody street-fights with leftist opponents. With the Falange outlawed in March 1936, Aznar began the civil war in prison but was quickly released when Nationalists took charge of the area. At the beginning of the civil war Aznar was appointed jefe of the national militias in succession to Luis Aguilar who had been killed.Payne, Fascism in Spain, p. 242 In this role he was close to Hans Joachim von Knobloch, the German consul in Alicante and in 1936 the two co-operated in a scheme to secure the release of the captured Falangist leader Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera through bribery. The plan failed and Aznar narrowly escaped capture himself, although the scheme was typical of his adventuring reputation.Paul Preston, Franco, London: 1995, pp. 194-5 He also campaigned vigorously to prevent the incorporation of the Falangist militias into a proposed united Nationalist force under Juan Yag√ºe, being suspicious of the Carlism of Yag√ºe and the other generals. Power struggle Following the execution of Primo de Rivera, Aznar became one of the leading figures within a power struggle in the Falange. Along with Sancho D√°vila y Fern√°ndez de Celis he formed the leadership of a group known as the legitimistas who were opposed to the leadership of Primo de Rivera's chosen successor Manuel Hedilla.Preston, Franco, p. 258 In an attempt to secure his position Hedilla organised an extraordinary meeting of the Falange, although trouble was promised as both he and Aznar organised their own militias in the run up to the meeting.Preston, Franco, pp. 261-2 It was Aznar who struck first, using his militia to seize to depose Hedilla on April 16, 1937, and instead placing at the head of the Falange a triumvirate made up of himself, Sancho D√°vila and their ally Jos√© Moreno.Preston, Franco, p. 262 Hedilla hit back however, enlisting the help of Finnish Nazi Carl von Haartman, who led Hedilla's troops in capturing the Falangist Headquarters from Aznar's forces.Preston, Franco, pp. 263-4 With the struggle threatening to impact upon the war effort Franco stepped in to publicly back Hedilla and ensure the arrest of Aznar, Sancho D√°vila and the others. However Franco used the opportunity to effectively neutralise the Falange by immediately announcing the formation of the Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista, effectively making the post of head of the Falange little more than ceremonial.Preston, Franco, pp. 265-6 Aznar was briefly imprisoned although he was soon released and appointed to the by then weakened Falangist National Council. Return to politics Despite his personal loss of face Aznar, who was released from prison very soon afterwards, was quickly reconciled to Franco's new movement and was appointed to the post of assessor of militias.Preston, Franco, p. 270 A member of the group's 12 man Junta Politica, Aznar joined with Fernando Gonz√°lez V√©lez in 1938 in an attempt to radicalise the movement along the lines of Italian fascism and Nazism and to make the party more important. The proposals of the Aznar group, delivered to the Junta by his ally Dionisio Ridruejo, sparked another possible schism, this time with the monarchist faction of Pedro Sainz Rodr√≠guez who were repulsed by what they saw as the republicanism of fascism. Again Franco sided against Aznar and had both he and Gonz√°lez V√©lez imprisoned for the plot.Preston, Franco, pp. 299-300 Franco's decision had been aided by an earlier intelligence report he had received which stated that Aznar and Gonz√°lez V√©lez were plotting against him, although there is little evidence to suggest that this was true.Stanley G. Payne, Falange: A History of Spanish Fascism, 1961, p. 185 He was released in November 1939 and allowed to return to some prominence within the party. Pro-Nazi activity Disenchanted by the conservative path adopted by the Franco regime Aznar, along with the likes of Ridruejo and other original Falangists such as the Garc√≠a-Noblejas brothers, joined the Blue Division during the Second World War.Wayne H. Bowen, Spaniards and Nazi Germany: Collaboration in the New Order, 2000, p. 108 Also serving in the fairly minor role of National Delegate for Health in the government, Aznar became associated with the efforts of Jos√© Luis de Arrese to increase ties with the Nazis following his war service.Bowen, Spaniards and Nazi Germany, p. 149 Combining his two roles Aznar instigated a scheme by which Spanish doctors could work in German hospitals and this programme continued until late 1944.Bowen, Spaniards and Nazi Germany, p. 191 Post-war Like most of the pro-Nazis within the Franco government Aznar was sidelined in 1945 as a new pro-western and anti-communist policy was adopted by El Caudillo. Nonetheless he retained a post on the Falange's Junta Politica until 1958, having first been appointed to the body in the 1930s. He was appointed to the Cortes Espa√±olas, a largely ceremonial body with little real power, in 1961 and remained in place in 1976 when he was one of the deputies to vote against the lifting of the ban on political parties.Rees, p. 17 His political involvement ended with the restoration of constitutional monarchy and he served as head of the blood transfusion service in a Madrid hospital.

Although it was raised to conduct small-scale raids and harass garrisons along the coast of German-occupied France, it was mainly employed as a highly trained infantry assault unit. Formed in July 1940, No. 6 Commando's first involvement in operations came in late 1941 when it contributed small forces to raids in Norway. In April 1942 the whole unit was scheduled to take part in Operation Myrmidon, in France, but this raid was eventually cancelled. As a result, the first full-scale operation that No. 6 Commando took part in was Operation Torch, the Allied landings in Algeria in November 1942. Later, it joined the advance into Tunisia in 1943. On 6 June 1944, it participated in the D-Day landings in France as part of Operation Overlord, coming ashore with the 1st Special Service Brigade which was tasked with linking up with the troops from the 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword. Following this, No. 6 Commando were used in the defence of the beachhead and the subsequent operations to break out from Normandy before being withdrawn with the rest of the brigade back to the United Kingdom in September 1944. In January 1945, they took part in the Allied counterattack during the Ardennes Offensive before joining the advance into Germany as part of Operation Plunder. With the end of hostilities, the unit was disbanded in 1946. History Formation In early June 1940 following the lightning advance of the Germans through France and the subsequent Dunkirk evacuation, the British prime minister, Winston Churchill, realised the need for Britain to maintain some form of offensive action and directed his chief staff officer and military adviser, General Hastings Ismay, to begin organising a force which could conduct raids along the coast of German-occupied Europe.Laffin 1999, pp. 3‚Äì4. Shortly after this, even before the concept had been fully developed, the War Office put out a request for volunteers among the troops in Britain to join a force they would be known as the Commandos.Parker 2000, p. 19. At this stage it was decided to create 12 commando units, each with an establishment of roughly 500 men.Parker 2000, p. 21. No. 6 Commando was one of the units formed at this time. Raised at ScarboroughSaunders 1959, p. 23. on 26 July 1940, it was placed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Fetherstonhaugh, who was a Territorial officer holding the substantive rank of captain in the Queen‚Äôs Royal Regiment. Initially, the unit's personnel were mainly drawn from the British Army's Western CommandMoreman 2006, p. 12. although later personnel were drawn from all commands and branches of the army. Garrison duties were undertaken at Romney Marsh and Brightlingsea, before the unit moved to Milford Haven where they undertook amphibious training. Around this time, the commando adopted the Scottish Tam o'Shanter as their official headdress.Chappell 1996, p. 26. alt=Two men in uniforms advance behind a wall carrying weapons In October, when the commandos were reorganised into \\"Special Service\\" battalions underneath the overarching Special Service Brigade, No. 6 Commando was amalgamated with No. 5 Commando and became a company-sized element in the 5th Special Service Battalion under Fetherstonhaugh's command and based at Helensburgh in Scotland.Moreman 2006, p. 18. In March 1941, following a reversal in War Office thinking, the battalion was broken up again into its constituent parts and No. 6 Commando was reorganised as a battalion equivalent unit, albeit with six troops instead of the original 10.Chappell 1996, p. 7.Saunders 1959, p. 38. Early operations Following the failures of the hastily planned commando operations undertaken in June and July 1940,Parker 2000, p. 27. there was a period of inactivity in which the concept was refined and detailed planning was undertaken while individual units carried out extensive and specialised training.Saunders 1959, pp. 39‚Äì40. In early 1941 a number of raids were undertaken but No. 6 Commando did not conduct its first operation until later in the year. On 9 December 1941, No. 6 Commando, along with a detachment from No. 12 Commando and some Norwegian soldiers, took part in Operation Kitbag, a raid on the town of Flor√∏ in Norway.Chappell 1996, p. 14. Embarking on , an infantry landing ship, they set out from Scapa Flow. During the voyage an incident occurred while some of the men were priming grenades for the raid which resulted in six men being killed and another 11 seriously wounded.Saunders 1959, p. 42. Nevertheless, the decision was made to continue with the raid, although it was eventually called off when the naval commander was unable to locate the fjord upon which Flor√∏ was located due to navigational difficulties. Later in the month, on 27 December, No. 6 Commando provided a small detachment of engineers to support No. 3 Commando's raid on V√•gs√∏y and M√•l√∏y in Norway as part of Operation Archery.Saunders 1959, p. 45. The raid proved a resounding success; however, No. 6 Commando did not participate in another until April 1942 when it took part in Operation Myrmidon. This operation was an abortive raid on the Adour Estuary in southern France.Saunders 1959, p. 101.Chappell 1996, p. 23. The plan was to disrupt road and rail transport between France and Spain by landing approximately 3,000 troops, consisting of No. 1 and No. 6 Commandos. They would be followed up by one and a half Royal Marine battalions along with an armoured regiment and a motor battalion.Macksey 1990, p. 109. After embarking on the transport ships and , the force spent a month sailing off the French coast disguised as Spanish merchant ships. On 5 April, the ships approached the mouth of the estuary in order to carry out the landing. Amidst bad weather they encountered a sandbar that they had not expected and unable to pass it, the raid was called off and the ships returned to the United Kingdom.Saunders 1959, p. 102. Operation Torch Because of these disappointments, No. 6 Commando's first major action as a formed unit came in November 1942 when, along with No. 1 Commando, it formed part of the spearhead for the Allied landings in Algeria as part of Operation Torch.Chappell 1996, p. 29. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Iain McAlpine, the commando embarked upon HMT Awatea in October 1942 in Glasgow along with some United States Army Rangers that were also taking part in the operation.Saunders 1959, p. 111. Tensions were high between the British and the Vichy French at this time because of a number of clashes and as a result the decision was made for the commandos to be equipped with American weapons and uniforms in an effort to placate the defenders.Chappell 1996, p. 59. alt=A map with military symbols depicting unit landings on a coast line The voyage from the United Kingdom took approximately three weeks and on 7 November 1942 Awatea arrived at its assigned station off the coast near the harbour of Algiers. At 10:15 pm No. 6 Commando took to their landing craft.Saunders 1959, p. 112. The launch did not go smoothly. From the outset they were hampered by the inexperience of the crews lowering the landing craft into the water and this, along with other factors that arose later including poor weather, breakdowns and navigational errors meant that the majority of No. 6 Commando's landing craft missed the rendezvous with the motor launch that was to guide them to the landing beaches. As a result, many landed at the wrong spot and the schedule was ruined. In the end the first landings took place at 3:00 am on 8 November, two hours later than planned, while the last wave came ashore in broad daylight at 6:30 am. Nevertheless, in most places resistance was light and the first landings experienced only desultory artillery and machine gun fire from the defenders as they came ashore. Faulty navigation meant that No. 9 Troop attempted to land on the Ilot de la Marine, which was described by author Hilary Saint George Saunders as \\"the most heavily fortified part of Algiers harbour\\", and it was here that the majority of the commando's casualties for the day‚Äîtwo killed and 19 wounded‚Äîwere suffered. Once ashore the commando's first task was to secure four beaches between Cape Caxine and Ras Acrata for the main force. This was achieved with relative ease as the defenders surrendered almost immediately.Saunders 1959, p. 113. After this part of the commando secured Pointe Pescarde, about from the town while another force, consisting of about three and a half troops under the second-in-command, Major Jock MacLeod of the Cameronians, moved on towards their main objective, which was to capture Fort Duperre, from where French artillery was firing upon the ships anchored offshore. MacLeod's men reached the fort with no trouble, but armed with only small arms, they were unable to capture it. At 1:30 pm, after the forward observer, a captain from the Royal Canadian Artillery directed an air strike on the fort from a number of Fleet Air Arm fighter-bombers, a dialogue was opened between the attackers and the defenders and after threats of a naval bombardment were made the fort‚Äôs garrison finally surrendered. Further operations in North Africa After capturing Fort Duperre, the commandos received reports that a force of some 2,000 Zouaves were moving up to recapture the position.Saunders 1959, p. 114. The French attack did not eventuate, however, and in the end the commandos marched all the way to Maison Blanche. Having only been issued with rations for a day, they had to rely on fruit and bread that they obtained by bartering with the locals on the way. Eventually they arrived at the port, where they embarked upon the destroyers HMS Wheatland and Lammerton and in company with a force of US Rangers they set out to capture the airfields at Allerlick and Duzzerville, near Bone. Upon arrival No. 6 Commando took up defensive positions in the orange groves alongside troops from the 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, the Royal West Kents and a number of Frenchmen that decided to join their cause.Saunders 1959, p. 115. A brief period of lull followed where the commandos were mainly involved in defending the airfield against air attacks from the Luftwaffe, before they moved off again to take part in the fighting around Medjez-el-Bab, where they fought on the left flank of the first French regular forces to engage the Germans since the fall of France in 1940, forming the spearhead of the advance towards Tunis.Saunders 1959, p. 116. alt=Propeller-driven aircraft dispersed along an unsealed airstrip On 21 November, reinforcements had reached them and the decision was made to move the commandos to La Calle by rail. With only intermittent air cover, the train was attacked by German fighters and No. 6 Commando suffered heavy casualties with 11 killed and 32 wounded. After the train driver jumped from the engine, one of the commandos took over the duties of driving the train. The unit remained in La Calle until 26 November, during which time the commandos were used to unload stores from the ships in the port, while half the unit carried out a reconnaissance patrol near Tabarka, to determine whether the German tanks that were parked there were real or decoys.Saunders 1959, pp. 116‚Äì117. Following this the commandos were used mainly as highly trained infantry units for the rest of their involvement in the North African campaign and for the majority of this time they were attached to the 36th Infantry Brigade.Saunders 1959, p. 117. Over the course of the next five months the commandos were involved in a number of costly attacks and periods of static defence, in between which they carried out aggressive fighting patrols.Saunders 1959, pp. 118‚Äì128. Indicative of the nature of the fighting during this time was No. 6 Commando's attack on the Green Hill feature on 30 November 1942. The main attack was launched at 4:00 am, as three troops‚ÄîNos. 3, 4 and 6 Troops‚Äîattacked from the north and west, while No. 5 Troop conducted a diversionary attack from the flank.Saunders 1959, p. 118. As soon as the main force left its line of departure it came under intense oblique fire from interlocking medium and heavy machine guns positioned in a diamond-shaped perimeter on top of the hill. The fire was so intense that the troop providing support by fire on the flank was unable to suppress it and the attack was temporarily postponed until the afternoon when it was hoped that artillery support could be utilised. At 4:00 pm, following a period of artillery preparation, the commandos launched their attack. Amidst thick mist and heavy rain, the attack went badly from the start. Shortly after stepping off, No. 5 Troop was ambushed by a German force disguised as locals, reducing its strength to just five men. The main assault force pressed on, although by now it consisted of only 67 men due to earlier losses. Part of the assault force‚ÄîNo. 6 Troop‚Äîtook heavy fire and lost forward momentum; however, the other two troops gained the top of the hill and broke in to the German position. Upon reaching the summit they were greeted by an intense volume of heavy machine gun fire and at this point it became clear that the preparatory bombardment had not been successful. Calls for further artillery support were denied due to a shortage of ammunition amongst the field batteries and eventually after a number of unsuccessful attempts at taking the position the commandos were forced to retire. The commando's losses on Green Hill amounted to 80 men killed or wounded and as a result No. 6 Commando had to be reorganised into four troops instead of the six that its establishment called for. Shortly after this the unit suffered another blow when its commanding officer, Iain McAlpine, suffered heart trouble and had to be evacuated to hospital. In his place Major Jock MacLeod temporarily took over command.Saunders 1959, pp. 118‚Äì119. In early January 1943, Lieutenant Colonel Derek Mills-Roberts arrived from the United Kingdom to take over the unit,Saunders 1959, p. 119. and he was in command when on 26 February 1943 they were involved in bitter fighting against two battalions of German parachute infantry with armoured support which attacked their position as part of an attempt to encircle the 1st Army by cutting the Medjez road.Saunders 1959, p. 125. In a fight that lasted over five hours, against an enemy that outnumbered them and had the advantage of heavy armoured support, the commandos, along with elements from the Reconnaissance Regiment, were able to stop the advance long enough for reinforcements to be brought up. In this action, No. 6 Commando incurred 11 killed, 34 wounded and 55 missing in action. This represented over 40 per cent of the unit's strength at the time, although later a number of those that were captured were recovered after the Germans withdrew.Saunders 1959, pp. 125‚Äì126. After this, No. 6 Commando was put into the role of mobile reserve in an effort to maintain the unit's integrity and spare it from incurring further losses that might render it unable to remain in the line. Nevertheless, throughout March and into April they continued to carry out patrol operations around Goubellat and Ben Arada.Saunders 1959, p. 126. Finally, in early April the decision was made to withdraw the commandos from the fighting in North Africa. Lacking the administrative support and reinforcements of regular infantry units, the unit's strength had fallen to just 150 men and as a result it was no longer considered effective. On 7 April, No. 6 Commando arrived in Algiers, where it remained for two weeks before embarking on HMT Staffordshire on 24 April. After a short voyage, it arrived back in the United Kingdom on 2 May 1943 to begin preparations for the invasion of German-occupied France.Saunders 1959, p. 127. D-Day and beyond After returning from North Africa, No. 6 Commando became part of the 1st Special Service Brigade, commanded by Brigadier The Lord Lovat.Moreman 2006, p. 91. The grouping of the commandos into brigades underneath the divisional-sized Special Service Group headquarters was part of the general reorganisation that took place in late 1943 as the evolution of their role from raiding to assault infantry was formalised. This saw a change in the individual unit establishments, with the addition of organic transport assets, as well as an increase in the allocation of indirect and direct fire support weapons at commando level.Chappell 1996, p. 30. Further support units were added at brigade level, including administration, transport, logistics and signals.Saunders 1959, p. 178. On D-Day, the 1st Special Service Brigade was tasked with landing behind the 8th Infantry Brigade, capturing the port of Ouistreham and linking up with the 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword, where they were holding the high ground near La Plein and the bridges over the River Orne and Caen Canal.Durnford-Slater 2002, p. 185.Neillands 2004, pp. 130‚Äì131. No. 6 Commando, with Lovat's brigade headquarters, came ashore on Queen Red beach of the Sword landing area, near La Breche, at 8:40 am on 6 June 1944.Saunders 1959, p. 238. No. 6 Commando led the brigade from the beach. Moving through a swamp that briefly slowed their progress, the commandos began to come up against the German defences that had not been destroyed by the naval bombardment.Saunders 1959, p. 240. Where possible they attempted an indirect approach, penetrating the defences using infiltration tactics. However, as they advanced towards bridges that had been captured by the paratroopers earlier in the day, they assaulted four pillboxes as well as an artillery battery that had been firing on the landing beaches.Saunders 1959, p. 241. Commandos from the 1st Special Service Brigade with captured German soldiers near Ranville on 7 June 1944 In the end it took the commando three-and-a-half hours to advance the to the bridges, with the lead elements, mounted on bicycles, linking up with gliderborne troops from D Company, 2nd Battalion, Oxford and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry under Major John Howard. After effecting the link up, the commandos joined with paratroops from the 9th Battalion, The Parachute Regiment in an attack on the village of La Plein, before digging in to begin defending against possible counterattack. By the end of the day, No. 6 Commando had suffered three killed and 32 wounded. In the week that followed the brigade undertook defensive duties as the Germans attempted to apply pressure on the beachhead by infiltrating the defensive positions on the eastern flank.Durnford-Slater 2002, p. 197.Saunders 1959, pp. 242‚Äì244. On 12 June, the airborne troops launched an attack on the village of Breville from where German artillery had been shelling them during the preceding week. Although successful, British casualties were high. Having been subjected to an intense artillery barrage, No. 6 Commando suffered 16 casualties. The barrage also wounded the brigade commander, Lord Lovat, to the extent that No. 6 Commando's commanding officer, Mills-Roberts, although wounded himself, was asked to take over from him. Major Anthony Lewis,Saunders 1959, p. 244. formerly of the Dorset Regiment, stepped up to take over as commanding officer temporarily, before being confirmed in the role on 24 June and receiving a promotion to acting-lieutenant colonel. He remained in command until 8 August 1944, when Lieutenant Colonel Charles Courtney-Coade of the South Staffordshire Regiment took over, and Lewis reverted to the role of second-in-command. Although they had initially been told that they would be withdrawn from the front within 48 hours, the strategic situation called that they remained at the front holding the ground on the eastern flank.Saunders 1959, p. 250. In late July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large wooded area, as the Germans began to withdraw.Durnford-Slater 2002, p. 202. Nevertheless, little progress was made, and, after a brief move which saw No. 6 Commando advance to Bavent, they went on the defensive again. On 18 August, a general advance began and the following morning No. 6 Commando took part in an attack to seize an area of high ground to the east of the Dives, north of Dozule.Saunders 1959, p. 251. The attack took place under the cover of darkness and the lead elements were able to infiltrate deep into the German positions before they were detected.Durnford-Slater 2002, p. 203. By daybreak the position had been captured and over the course of the day four determined counter-attacks were repelled. In one attack, a troop from No. 6 Commando rushed their attackers, killing the senior German officer and capturing 25 prisoners as the attack was broken up. Over the next five days, the brigade advanced a further before a halt was finally called on 26 August 1944. On 7 September, No. 6 Commando, along with the rest of the 1st Special Service Brigade, were withdrawn from the line and returned to the United Kingdom to prepare to be redeployed to India for operations against the Japanese in Burma.Saunders 1959, pp. 288‚Äì289. They had been in action continuously for 83 days. Saunders 1959, p. 289. Ardennes offensive and the crossing of the Rhine Men from the 1st Commando Brigade fight on the outskirts of Wesel 1945. It had been planned to send the brigade‚Äîwhich had been renamed the 1st Commando Brigade in late 1944‚Äîto India, however, the effect of the German Ardennes Offensive prevented thisDurnford-Slater 2002, p. 212. and in January 1945, still under the command of Brigadier Derek Mills-Roberts, they crossed the English Channel by sea and landed in the Netherlands from where they were deployed to Asten on the Maas. By the time they arrived the German advance had been largely halted and it was not until 23 January that the brigade was engaged in any large-scale operations. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Lewis, that night No. 6 Commando joined Operation Blackcock. Lewis had taken over from Courtenay-Coade after the latter had experienced complications from the head injury he had suffered in France earlier. As part of Blackcock, the unit advanced over the ice-covered Juliana Canal and took up positions at Maasbracht, in support of No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando's advance on St. Joostburg.Saunders 1959, p. 290. The following day, after the Royal Marines had met stiff resistance, No. 6 Commando attempted to advance from its position in an effort to relieve the pressure on them. This attack was well supported by artillery and a squadron of armour from the 8th Hussars, nevertheless, the commandos were stopped near an orchard close to the crossroads by a hastily formed, but well-led, force consisting of Luftwaffe aircrew and Fallschirmj√§ger. As the rest of the brigade advanced towards the town of Linne, attempts to cross the Montforterbeek Canal were frustrated by the defenders who managed to destroy all the bridges that crossed it. The ice over the canal was not thick enough to support the crossing of armour, so temporary bridges were brought up and erected by members of the Royal Engineers.Saunders 1959, p. 291. Finally, after a number of attempts at forcing a crossing, an assault force from No. 3 Commando managed to enter Linne. After this the commandos came up against part of the Siegfried Line defences around Roermond.Saunders 1959, p. 292. A short halt followed and during this time No. 6 Commando sent out a number of patrols mounted on the tanks of the 8th Hussars.Saunders 1959, p. 293. In February, the snow thawed and the ground turned to mud which rendered the tanks useless and as a result the commandos carried out their patrols on foot. In early March, No. 6 Commando moved with the rest of the 1st Commando Brigade to Venray where they carried out rehearsals for Operation Plunder, the crossing of the Rhine. Over the course of two weeks training was undertaken at a creek near Wansum and on 23 March 1945 the assault took place, with the objective being the capture of the town of Wesel.Saunders 1959, p. 294. No. 6 Commando went across in the second wave on board storm-boats crewed by engineers. They came under fire almost immediately and as a result of this, and several mechanical failures, a number of boats were sunk before they reached the landing site at Grav Islet, where the lead unit, No. 46 (Royal Marine) Commando had established a bridgehead.Saunders 1959, p. 296. Ultimately the majority of the commandos made it to the form up point and No. 6 Commando passed through the marines' positions to lead the advance into the town from the north-east, marking the route as they went with white tape. Over the course of the next two days the commandos took control of the town and repelled a number of German counterattacks, before Wesel finally fell late on 25 March.Saunders 1959, p. 297. alt=A black and white image of soldiers crossing a body of water in an amphibious vehicle After this the brigade continued to advance, moving through Ruddenburg and Greven before carrying out an attack on Osnabruck on 4 April 1945.Durnford-Slater 2002, p. 217. On the night of 7/8 April they crossed the Weser River in assault boats and under the cover of darkness carried out a flanking manoeuvre on the Germans occupying the town of Leese, catching them by surprise.Saunders 1959, p. 300. Their next task was the capture of the road bridge spanning the Aller river as part of the 11th Armoured Division's advance on the town of Essel. The 1st Commando Brigade carried out a preliminary move across the river over a railway bridge some distance away from their objective and after forcing their way across, they removed the explosives that had been placed on the bridge and dug in on the other side.Saunders 1959, p. 301. Over the course of about three-and-a-half hours they repelled a number of determined counterattacks, before No. 6 Commando, supported by Vickers machine guns fixed bayonets and charged the German marines that were defending the bridge, and inflicting heavy casualties upon them. With the bridge having been captured other elements of the brigade established a bridgehead for the advancing 11th Armoured and on 19 April they arrived in L√ºneburg, where they began to prepare for the crossing of the Elbe.Saunders 1959, p. 302. The assault began at 2:00 am on 29 April with No. 6 Commando leading the way across in Buffalo landing vehicles. Under fire the entire way, they landed downstream from the objective‚ÄîLauenburg‚Äîand launched an assault against the defenders who were perched on a cliff overlooking the narrow landing beach. After reaching the top of the cliff, they broke through the defences and established themselves to the north of the town, while the rest of the brigade came up. Throughout the remainder of the day, the town was cleared and patrols sent out; a patrol from No. 6 Commando captured the Elbe‚ÄìTrave Canal bridge, arriving just as the demolition party was preparing it for detonation. Resistance in Lauenburg ceased on 30 April 1945 and during the beginning of May the 1st Commando Brigade advanced towards the Baltic Sea, which they reached at Neustadt. A few days later Germany surrendered and No. 6 Commando's war service came to an end. Disbandment Following the end of hostilities, No. 6 Commando remained in Germany to undertake various occupation duties along with the rest of the 1st Commando Brigade. These duties included searching for German personnel and officials that were wanted for questioning or to be tried for war crimes, distributing food to the populace and helping to restore law and order as part of the reconstruction process.Parker 2000, p. 183. In early 1946, the unit returned to the United Kingdom and it was eventually disbanded.Chappell 1996, p. 32. At this time the decision was made to disband all the Army commando units and demobilise or return their personnel to their original regiments or branches of service. Consequently, the commando role was maintained solely by the Royal Marines Commandos, although they too were subjected to cut backs, being reduced from eight wartime units to just three.Neillands 2004, p. 225.

Plot summary The publisher of The Tribune newspaper, Henry Kruger, who is used to ordering his staff around, finds that he is ignored by everyone in his own home. He is shocked when he discovers a scandalous picture of his own daughter, Phyllis, on the front page of the competing paper The Daily Argus. Henry pays a visit to the dubious publisher of the competing paper, Andy McDonald, and warns him to ever publish a picture like that again, or Henry will kill him. Henry is unaware of the fact that a man named \\"Slippery\\" Joe Clary has overheard his conversation with Andy, which Joe later reveals to him, threatening to expose him. Henry counters by claiming that Andy was the one who got Joe sentenced with his testimony, and that Andy dated Joe's girlfriend while he was in the slammer. To avoid further complications, Henry takes a long vacation, following the suggestion of his chauffeur. While Henry is away, without his family, Slippery Joe murders publisher Andy and hides the body in the trunk of Henry's parked car. Slippery Joe also breaks into Andy's safe, trying to get back a written confession of a previous murder, but finds out the document must have been hidden on the Publisher's body. Henry has brought his car on the vacation, and finds Andy's dead body in the trunk when he arrives at his hunting lodge. Panicking, he decides to dump the body to not be accused of murder, but his chauffeur sees the body before he has a chance to realize his plan. The chauffeur, eager to protect his employer, remove the body from the trunk and hides it inside the lodge. Visitor's come and go at the lodge during the vacation, and the body is moved and hidden several times by the two men to avoid discovery. Soon enough Slippery Joe too comes looking for the body to retrieve the document. When Henry's family one day discovers that he has left on vacation, they also come up to the lodge to visit. After them come additional relatives, and even a news reporter from The Daily Argus, trying to get another scandalous story to publish in the paper. The body is discovered by every visitor to the lodge at some point, and the chauffeur has to move it constantly to confuse the guests, and Henry convinces them all that they have hallucinated. The local officer of the law, police constable Trigg, discovers Andy's car hidden not far from the cabin, left there by Slippery Joe. Trigg immediately suspects Henry of murdering Andy and arrests him. James, Henry's son, falsely claims to have murdered Andy to get Henry out of jail, but then Andy's body is found, with the confession in one of his pockets. Slippery Joe is arrested for the murder. Slippery Joe admits his guilt when he learns that Trigg has the confession, and Henry is cleared of all suspicion. After the commotion, Henry's family promise to not ignore him anymore. Despite this, Henry finds himself sitting alone at breakfast the day after.Film profile; accessed 10 March 2014. Cast *J.

These locations were largely religious in nature, such as temples and other religious sites. A similar concept, the Cities of Refuge, existed in the ancient Levant.  Ancient Israel and Judah  The Cities of Refuge were certain Levitical towns in the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah in which the perpetrators of accidental manslaughter could claim the right of asylum, though he would still have to stand trial. Outside of these cities, blood vengeance against such perpetrators was allowed by law. The Bible names six cities as being cities of refuge: Golan, Ramoth, and Bosor, on the east of the Jordan River,Deuteronomy 4:43 and Joshua 20:8 and Kedesh, Shechem, and Hebron on the western side.Joshua 20:7 Ancient Greece In ancient Greece the temples, altars, sacred groves, and statues of the gods generally possessed the privileges of protecting slaves, debtors, and criminals, who fled to them for refuge. The laws, however, do not appear to have recognised the right of all such sacred places to afford the protection which was claimed, but to have confined it to a certain number of temples, or altars, which were considered in a more especial manner to have the asylia (Servius ad Virg. Aen. ii. 761.). There were several places in Athens which possessed this privilege, of which the best known was the Theseum, or temple of Theseus, in the city, which was chiefly intended for the protection of the ill-treated slaves, who could take refuge in this place, and compel their masters to sell them to some other person (Plut. Theseus, 36; Schol. ad Aristoph. Equit. 1309; Hesych. and Suidas, s.v.). The other places in Athens which possessed the jus asyli were: the Altar of Pity, in the Agora, the altar of Zeus Ayopcuos, the Altar of the Twelve Gods, the altar of the Eumenides on the Areopagus, the Theseum in the Piraeus, and the altar of Artemis, at Munichia (Meier, Alt. Proc. p. 404). Among the most celebrated places of asylum in other parts of Greece, there are the temple of Poseidon in Laconia, on Mount Taenarus (Time. i. 128, 133; Corn. Nep. Pans. c. 4); the temple of Poseidon in Calauria (Pint. Demosth. 29); and the temple of Athena Alea in Tegea (Paus. iii. 5. ¬ß 6). It would appear, however, that all sacred places were supposed to protect an individual to a certain extent, even if their right to do so was not recognised by the laws of the state, in which they were situated. In such cases, however, as the law gave no protection, it seems to have been considered lawful to use any means in order to compel the individuals who had taken refuge to leave the sanctuary, except dragging them out by personal violence. Thus it was not uncommon to force a person from an altar or a statue of a god, by the application of fire. (Eurip. Androm. 256, with Schol.; Plant. Mostett. v. 1. 65.) Incidents of violation of asylum include the deaths of Cylon of Athens and Pausanias of Sparta. The 464 BC Sparta earthquake has been viewed by the contemporaries as divine vengeance for the Spartan ephors' murder of helots in violation of the asylum in the Tainaron temple. In the time of Tiberius, the number of places possessing the jus asyli in the Greek cities in Greece and Asia Minor became so numerous, as seriously to impede the administration of justice. In consequence of this, the senate, by the command of the emperor, limited the jus asyli to a few cities, but did not entirely abolish it, as Suetonius (Tib. 37) has erroneously stated (See Tacit. Ann. iii. 60‚Äî63, iv. 14 and Ernesti's Ex cursus to Suet. Tib. 37.). Ancient Rome The asylum (temple of the god Asylaeus) that Romulus is said to have opened at Rome on the Capitoline Hill, between its two summits, in order to increase the population of the city (Liv. i. 8; Veil. Pat. i. 8; Dionys. ii. 15), was, according to the legend, a place of refuge for the inhabitants of other states, rather than a sanctuary for those who had violated the laws of the city. In the republican and early imperial times, a right of asylum, such as existed in the Greek states, does not appear to have been recognised by the Roman law. Livy seems to speak of the right (xxxv. 51) as peculiar to the Greeks:‚ÄîTemphim esi Apollinis Delium‚Äî eo jure sancto quo sunt templa quae asyla Graeci ap pellant. By a constitutio of Antoninus Pius, it was decreed that, if a slave in a province fled to the temples of the gods or the statues of the emperors, to avoid the ill-usage of his master, the praeses could compel the master to sell the slave (Gains, i. 53); and the slave was not regarded by the law as a runaway‚Äîfugitivus. This constitutio of Antoninus is quoted in Justinian's Institutes (1. tit. 8. s. 2), with a slight alteration; the words ad aedem sacram are substituted for ad fana deorum, since the jus asyli was in his time extended to churches. Those slaves who took refuge at the statue of an emperor were considered to inflict disgrace on their master, as it was reasonably supposed that no slave would take such a step, unless he had received very bad usage from his master. If it could be proved that any individual had instigated the slave of another to flee to the statue of an emperor, he was liable to an action corrupti servi (Dig. 4-7. tit. 11. s. 5.). The right of asylum seems to have been generally, but not entirely, confined to slaves (Dig. 48. tit. 19. s. 28. ¬ß 7. Comp. Osiander, De Asylis Gentilium, in Gronov. Thesaur. vol. vi.; Simon, Sur les Asyles, in Mem. de PA cad. des Inscript. vol. iii.; Bringer, De Asylorum Origine, Uau9 et Abusu Lugd. Bat. 1828; C. Neu, De Asylis Gott. 1837; respecting the right of asylum in the churches under the Christian emperors, see Rein, Das Criminalrecht der Romer, p. 896.). In ancient Greece the term asylia was also applied to the security from plunder and piracy (asylia on land and sea), which was sometimes granted by one state to another, or even to single individuals (See Bb'ckh, Corp. Inscrip. i. p. 725.).

While the four chimneys of the plant were demolished in 2001, much of the original building still exists today. Till 2013 it was used for events and art display. Today plant is unsafe and closed to public. The first block of the lignite-fired power plant (6 x 35 MW) was built between 1937 and 1940. After 1943 installation was begun on the world's first commercial HVDC, the Elbe Project. It was completed in 1945, but never went in service. The power plant suffered no damage during World War II. After dismantling of the equipment during the soviet occupation the inverter hall was transformed into a workshop. A lot of equipment from the power plant was also dismantled.

MacBride entered the navy after serving on merchant vessels and distinguished himself in a number of actions during the Seven Years' War, including cutting out a privateer, which secured him the rank of post-captain by the end of the conflict. He was instrumental in establishing and securing a British settlement on the Falkland Islands in the years of peace which followed, and also performed service to the Royal Family by transporting the King's sister, Caroline Matilda. Still in active service by the outbreak of war with the American colonies, MacBride took command of a ship of the line and saw action in engagements under Keppel and Rodney. He was also active against privateers, capturing the Comte d'Artois in a heated battle off the Irish coast. Further service followed with Parker's fleet against the Dutch and with Barrington in the Channel. MacBride ended the war serving ashore in Ireland, and in 1784 embarked on a political career, becoming MP for Plymouth. Promoted to flag rank with the outbreak of war with Revolutionary France, he commanded squadrons off the enemy coasts, and transported troops to support land operations on the continent. His last active service was in 1795, though he was promoted to Admiral of the Blue shortly before his death in 1800. Family and early life John MacBride was born in Scotland around 1735, the second son of the Presbyterian minister Robert MacBride. The MacBrides moved to Ireland shortly after John's birth, when Robert became minister of Ballymoney, in County Antrim. John's brother, David MacBride, became a noted medical writer. John MacBride initially went to sea with the merchant service in 1751, and joined the navy as an able seaman three years later, in 1754. He served first aboard the 24-gun in the West Indies for a number of years, before returning to British wars and serving aboard , the flagship in the Downs for a few months. MacBride passed his lieutenant's examination on 6 October 1758, and received his commission on 27 October. He was moved into the hired cutter , and in August 1761 came across a French privateer anchored in the Dunkirk roadstead. MacBride made contact with the frigate and asked her captain for four armed and manned boats. Maidstones captain readily agreed, and at 10 o'clock that night the boats left the British ships and approached the privateer with muffled oars. They came within pistol shot and hailed the French vessel, and on receiving no reply, boarded her. The British boarded on both sides of the vessel, and carried the ship with two men wounded. MacBride himself shot and killed the French lieutenant as he aimed a gun at the British boat. The total French losses were two dead and five wounded. Having secured the vessel, the British took her out to sea under the guns of a French battery. MacBride's good service brought him a promotion to master and commander on 7 April 1762, and an appointment to command the fireship . From there he moved to command the sloop on 27 May 1763, still at the rank of commander. After some time spent on the Home station, MacBride received a promotion to post-captain on 20 June 1765, and took command of the 30-gun . This was followed in August 1765 with command of the 32-gun , and a mission to establish a colony on the Falkland Islands. Falkland Islands MacBride arrived with Jason, and the storeship , in January 1766, with orders to secure a settlement and to inform any existing inhabitants that the islands were a British possession. The British consolidated Port Egmont, made several cruises in the surrounding waters, and in December came across the French settlement. In a cordial meeting MacBride informed the French governor M. de Neville of the British claim, which the French politely rejected. Unbeknownst to both de Neville and MacBride, Louis Antoine de Bougainville, who had established the French settlement, had agreed to sell the colony to Spain. The resulting tensions between the Spanish and British claims would nearly lead to war in 1770, but in the meantime MacBride returned home, reporting the situation to the government. He later published a 13-page monograph, probably in 1770, entitled A Journal of the Winds and Weather...at Falkland Islands from 1 February 1766 to 19 January 1767. Interwar years After his return to Britain MacBride was given command of the 22-gun in August 1767 and employed to cruise in the English Channel. He spent several years aboard Seaford, before transferring to take command of the 32-gun in March 1771, followed by the 32-gun in August that year. He was in command of Southampton in May 1772 when he received orders to command a small squadron tasked with transporting Caroline Matilda, former Queen of Denmark and Norway and sister of King George III, from Elsinore to Stadt. The squadron consisted of Southampton, and two of MacBride's former commands, Seaford, and Cruizer. In April 1773 he took command of . American War of Independence Battle of Ushant. MacBride saw little actual fighting in the confused engagement. With the outbreak of war with the American colonies, MacBride was appointed to take command of the 64-gun on 6 November 1776. He was present at the Battle of Ushant on 28 July 1778, but did not become heavily engaged in the confused action. In the ensuing argument over the outcome of the battle, MacBride gave evidence in favour of Admiral Keppel that was an important factor in Keppel's acquittal at his court-martial. MacBride was less supportive of Sir Hugh Palliser. He remained in command of Bienfaisant, and in December joined Sir George Rodney's fleet to relieve Gibraltar. During the voyage the British fleet came across a Spanish convoy transporting naval stores from San Sebasti√°n to C√°diz, and engaged it. The British succeeded in capturing the convoy, while MacBride distinguished himself in engaging the Spanish flagship Guipuscoana, which surrendered to him. Battle off Cape St Vincent, 16 January 1780 by Francis Holman, painted 1780 shows the Santo Domingo exploding. MacBride had been heavily engaged with her just prior to her destruction. On 16 January the fleet again encountered Spanish ships, this time off Cape St. Vincent. The Spanish fleet, under Admiral Juan de L√°ngara, were engaged in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent, and again MacBride was in the thick of the action. He took his ship in to engage the San Domingo, with the Bienfaisant narrowly escaping significant damage after her opponent blew up. He then went on to chase down and capture L√°ngara's flagship, the 80-gun Fenix. MacBride sent Lieutenant Thomas Louis aboard to take possession, but as a smallpox outbreak was raging on the Bienfaisant, MacBride did not take the usual step of transferring some of the captured officers and men aboard his own ship. Instead he reached an agreement with de L√°ngara, that should the ships encounter a French or Spanish force, he would allow the Fenix to be defended against them. If the Bienfaisant escaped but the Fenix was retaken, de L√°ngara and his men would consider themselves to still be prisoners of war, but if Fenix escaped and Bienfaisant was taken, then de L√°ngara and his men would be freed. In any event both ships made it to Gibraltar without incident, after which MacBride was given the honour of taking Rodney's despatches back to Britain. MacBride set off at once, but was delayed by adverse winds. Consequently, his despatches arrived several days after an identical set had reached London, delivered by Captain Edward Thomson, who had left Rodney later than MacBride, but who had had a faster voyage. MacBride and the Artois connection Rodney's fleet returned to Britain in March, and MacBride rejoined the Bienfaisant. In early August a large French privateer, the 64-gun Comte d'Artois, was reported to have sailed from Brest to cruise off the Irish south coast. MacBride was ordered to sail in company with the 44-gun and to capture the dangerous vessel. After several days in search of the vessel, a mysterious sail was finally sighted early on 13 August, chasing after some of the ships of a convoy departing from Cork. MacBride ranged up and fell in with the unidentified ship, which hoisted English colours. Both ships came within pistol shot, and it was not until there was some communication between the two ships, that MacBride could be satisfied of her identity. By now the two ships were so close, with Bienfaisant off the Comte de'Artoiss bow, that neither ship could bring their main guns to bear. Instead both ships opened fire with muskets until MacBride could manoeuvre away and a general action ensued. After an hour and ten minutes the French vessel surrendered, having had 21 killed and 35 wounded, while Bienfaisant had three killed and 20 wounded. The Charon had only joined the action towards the end of the engagement and had a single man wounded. The capture had an unusual sequel, for just over a year later, and under a different captain, Bienfaisant captured another privateer, this time named Comtesse d'Artois. Battle of Dogger Bank, 5 August 1781 In a further coincidence MacBride was appointed in January 1781 to command the 40-gun , a former French ship captured in 1780 by . MacBride served in the North Sea with Sir Hyde Parker's fleet, and fought against the Dutch at the Battle of Dogger Bank on 5 August 1781. After the battle Parker temporarily moved MacBride into the 80-gun , whose captain, John MacCartney, had been killed during the battle. MacBride resumed command of Artois after the fleet's return to port, and continued to cruise in the North Sea. On 3 December he engaged and captured two large 24-gun Dutch privateers, the Hercules and Mars. Nine men were killed and fifteen wounded on Mars, while 13 were killed and 20 wounded on Hercules. Artois had one man killed and six wounded. By 1782 MacBride was operating in the Channel, and in April was sent out as a scout ahead of the main force under Admiral Samuel Barrington, which aimed to intercept a French squadron that had left Brest bound for the East Indies. He sighted the force on 20 April and alerted Barrington. The British moved in and that day and the following captured over half of the French force. After this success MacBride was appointed to the Irish station in June, where he worked in the impress service while Artois cruised under her first lieutenant. Years of peace At the end of the war with America, MacBride left the Artois, but in June was able to obtain command of the 32-gun . He commanded her until the end of the year, after which he was temporarily unemployed at sea. MacBride took this opportunity to enter politics, and in 1784 he was elected as MP for Plymouth, holding the seat until 1790. He gave several speeches on naval matters, and sat on the Duke of Richmond's commission into the defences of Portsmouth and Plymouth between 1785 and 1786. He opposed a plan for fortifying the naval dockyards, both on the commission and in parliament. In 1788 he returned to an active, though not a seagoing command, when he took over the Plymouth guardship, the 74-gun . By 1790, with the threat of the Spanish Armament looming, MacBride took Cumberland to Torbay to join the fleet assembling there under Lord Howe. French Revolutionary Wars MacBride was promoted to rear- admiral on 1 February 1793, as part of the general promotion following the outbreak of war. He became commander-in-chief on the Downs Station, commanding a frigate squadron with his flag in Cumberland, later transferring his flag to the 32-gun . He took possession of Ostend after the French retreat in early 1793, and in October transported reinforcements under General Sir Charles Grey to assist in the defence of Dunkirk. He took command of the 36-gun at the end of the year and sailed from Portsmouth on 1 December carrying an army under the Earl of Moira to support French royalists in Brittany and Normandy. Following this service he took command of a small squadron in the Western Approaches, flying his flag in a number of different vessels, including the sloop , the 74-gun and the 64-gun . The squadron did not achieve any significant successes, and MacBride had the misfortune to break his leg while mounting his horse, forcing him to temporarily relinquish his duties. He was promoted to rear-admiral of the red on 11 April, and on 4 July to vice-admiral of the blue. Promoted to vice-admiral of the white on 1 June 1795, MacBride became commander of the squadron in the North Sea assigned to watch the Dutch fleet in the Texel, flying his flag in the 74-gun . He stepped down from the post in late 1795, and was not actively employed at sea again. He was promoted to admiral of the blue on 14 February 1799. Admiral John MacBride died of a paralytic seizure at the Spring Garden Coffee House, London on 17 February 1800. Family and issue MacBride married early in his career, but no details are known, other than that his wife was the daughter of a naval officer. She is presumed to have died, for MacBride married Ursula Folkes, eldest daughter of William Folkes of Hillington Hall, Norfolk on 14 July 1774. Their son, John David MacBride, became principal of Magdalen Hall, Oxford. MacBride's daughter, Charlotte, married Admiral Willoughby Lake in 1795.

It contains 8,241 buried German soldiers from World War I.(de) Website German war grave commission (in German: Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berf√ºrsorge): German war cemetery at Hooglede (Belgium)  Military incidents  On October 19, 1914, Hooglede was occupied by German soldiers. The Hooglede cemetery in the Beverenstraat arose in 1917 when the cemetery in Hooglede was no longer sufficient for the mounting deathtoll. There were some new cemeteries, including \\"Ehrenfriedhof Hooglede Ost Beveren\\" along the street. After the liberation by the French, approximately 4100 German soldiers were buried in the soil of Hooglede.  Care of graves  The German cemeteries were supervised by the Belgian military service of tombs, but in 1926 all the cemeteries were the responsibility of the Amtlicher Deutscher Gr√§berdienst. Between 1932 and 1937, this service was responsible for the German cemetery in the Beverenstraat. Many graves in various cemeteries in Hooglede, Gits, Handzame, Torhout, and Lichtervelde were sent to Hooglede. The graves then were marked by crosses. In 1937, a chapel was built using stones from a German pavilion at the World Exhibition in Paris. During World War II, an additional 29 German soldiers were buried at the cemetery. These soldiers were later sent to another cemetery. After the Second World War, the supervision of the cemetery was again in the hands of the Belgian organization \\"Nos Tombs\\". Not much later, in 1954, the monitoring was taken over by the German War Graves Commission (' in German).  Graves centralized  Numerous German graves dispersed over the country were transferred between 1956 and 1958 from 128 cemeteries to the four cemeteries in the Flemish part of Belgium. Hooglede is one of the four main German cemeteries in Belgium. The others being in Langemark, Vladslo, Menen. During the renovation works in Hooglede in 1957-58, the entrance arches of the chapel were reduced to 9. This change came in two phases. The crosses were also replaced by nameplates. After 1960, no more major works were performed.  Monument of historical value  In 2008 this graveyard was classified as historical monument by the Belgium Office for the preservation of monuments because of its historical cultural and architectural value.(de) Website German war grave commission (in German: Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berf√ºrsorge): German war cemetery at Hooglede (Belgium)(nl) Registered historical value (Onroerend Erfgoed)  Reconciliation  The German War Graves Commission sometimes organizes youth camps under the motto \\"Reconciliation among the graves, work for peace\\".

The Athenaeum was situated near the Capitoline Hill: its site was discovered in 2009 during excavation for the construction of the Rome Metro C Line, in the middle of what is now Piazza Venezia.Carlo Alberto Bucci. \\"Roma, riaffiora l'ateneo di Adriano Ritrovata la scuola dei filosofi.

Under Theodosius II, for example, there were three orators, ten grammarians, five sophists, one philosopher, two lawyers, or jurisconsults. Besides the instruction given by these magistri, poets, orators, and critics were accustomed to recite their compositions there, and these prelections were sometimes honoured with the presence of the emperors themselves. There were other places where such recitations were made, as the Library of Trajan; sometimes also a room was hired, and made into an auditorium. The Athenaeum seems to have continued in high repute till the sixth century. Little is known of the details of study or discipline in the Athenaeum, but in the constitution of the year 370, there are some regulations respecting students in Rome, from which it would appear that it must have been a very extensive and important institution. And this is confirmed by other statements contained in some of the Fathers and other ancient authors, from which we learn that young men from all parts, after finishing their usual school and college studies in their own town or province, used to resort to Rome as a sort of higher university, for the purpose of completing their education. After the moving of the capital city to Milan and Constantinople similar schools were opened also in these cities, as well as in the other main cities of the Empire, like Carthage. In the modern period, the term \\"Athenaeum\\" is widely used in various countries for schools, libraries, museums, cultural centers, performance halls and theaters, periodicals, clubs and societies - all aspiring to fulfill a cultural function similar to that of the ancient Roman school.

It is a spiritual successorhttps://www.destructoid.com/okamiden-producer-not-a-sequel-a- spiritual-successor--171281.phtml to ≈åkami, a game released originally for the PlayStation 2 and later ported first to the Wii, then to other platforms. ≈åkamiden was designed by Kuniomi Matsushita, the director of the Wii port of ≈åkami, and Motohide Eshiro, producer of Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth and Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny. It was released in Japan on September 30, 2010, in North America on March 15, 2011, and in Europe on March 18, 2011. It stars Chibiterasu, a small celestial wolf born from Amaterasu, protagonist of ≈åkami, and features much of the same gameplay as its predecessor, including the Celestial Brush which allows players to freeze the gameplay and draw shapes or patterns using the touch screen. Development began when Matsushita expressed an interest in creating a new ≈åkami game, and showed Eshiro a technical demo of such a game in December 2008. Because the demo was so well-done, development began on a sequel, and in September 2010, four years after ≈åkami debuted, the game was released to positive reviews from critics and moderate commercial success. Gameplay ≈åkamiden plays similarly to its predecessor, ≈åkami, as an action-adventure game similar to games from The Legend of Zelda series; Zelda was an inspiration for both ≈åkamis director Hideki Kamiya and ≈åkamidens producer Motohide Eshiro. The \\"Celestial Brush\\", the ability to freeze the screen and draw symbols via the touchscreen with the stylus to bring changes on the game's world, remains central to the game for solving puzzles and fighting enemies. The theme of returning life to the world also returns from ≈åkami. A new feature is the ability for Chibiterasu to team up with partners. They can be used to explore the overworld with, as well as battle enemies. The new Guidance technique, also called the \\"Shirabe\\" or \\"courage\\" brush by Daniel Feit of Wired, may be used to move Chibiterasu's partner independently across areas Chibiterasu cannot cross; this is often required to progress in the game. The game uses the face buttons to move Chibiterasu about the world, with the top display being the current third- person view and the bottom showing a mini-map of the area. By pressing either shoulder button, the Celestial Brush is activated: the game pauses as the top screen is moved down to the bottom and rendered as a parchment, and the player then can use the stylus and touchscreen to draw to activate various powers of the Celestial Brush. The game will sense the speed at which the player draws the stylus across the screen and reflect this in the weight of the stroke drawn on-screen; a quick motion will lead to a faint, partial line while slow movements will create bold strokes. Brush techniques can also be used to defeat enemies. Many enemies are weak to one specific brush technique, and by defeating the enemy in this manner, the player can earn rare items that help to upgrade Chibiterasu's power. Some sections of the game include minigames based on other genres, such as shoot 'em ups and side scrollers. Plot The Celestial Brush returns in ≈åkamiden, allowing players to interact with the game's world by drawing on the DS' touch screen to evoke special magic such as plant restoration. Much of ≈åkamidens story centers around the children of previous characters from ≈åkami and their adventures and the relationships that form through the game's story, according to producer Motohide Eshiro. The game takes place nine months after the events of ≈åkami. In spite of Amaterasu's battle against the Dark Lord Yami, which would kill all the demons in Nippon, they return. The Konohana Sprite Sakuya, a character from the original ≈åkami, summons the Sun Goddess Amaterasu, but instead finds Chibiterasu, who looks like a young version of Amaterasu. Chibiterasu, as revealed by Matsushita, is, in fact, Amaterasu's child/son, as was previously speculated. Producer Eshiro noted that he is a \\"young form of existence\\" and not fully grown; he retains several abilities of Amaterasu, including the Celestial Brush, but lacks her power, which will be reflected in the plot and gameplay. Matsushita also called Chibiterasu clumsy and having childlike traits of \\"being tearfully sentimental or not being able to make decisions\\". Issun, Amaterasu's partner in the first game, is unavailable to help Chibiterasu as he is busy with his duties as the Celestial Envoy, and thus Chibiterasu is tasked to find other partners to help rid the world of evil. One of the partners that accompanies Chibiterasu is the adopted son of Susano and Kushi, two characters from ≈åkami. Other partners include: , a young mermaid that is able to swim about in underwater stages and can provide a water source for Waterspout; , a spirit medium who helps Chibiterasu see ethereal elements; , a flute-playing young boy that bears some traits similar to Waka from ≈åkami; and , an overweight boy carrying fire who can walk through ice spikes and can provide a fire source for the Inferno technique. Chibiterasu and his various partners initially track down an evil summoner named that gave rise to the curses across the lands. When Chibiterasu defeats King Fury, they find a stronger evil known as , who is seeking to curse the lands of Nippon. To do so, he must acquire the blood from Orochi, the eight-headed demon fought several times in the first game. Akuro travels back one year to when Amaterasu faced down Orochi; Chibiterasu follows it and are able to prevent it from recovering the blood. Furious, Akuro travels back 100 years in time, when the swordsman Nagi and Shiranui, the wolf form that Amaterasu was later given, defeated Orochi. The team travel back in time to follow Akuro. Just before they enter Moon Cave, Kurow leaves the group, claiming to have found his 'True Mission'. The pup, saddened at Kurow's sudden departure, heads on into the cave to fight Akuro. Chibi, however is unable to prevent Akuro from obtaining the blood this time, as Kurow, who has apparently turned evil and become Akuro's servant, stops Chibiterasu's efforts. Chibiterasu and his other allies follow Akuro to the dark realms where they find the demon has taken up residence in the body of Kuni and that Kurow intends on fighting the pup. Chibiterasu is forced to fight his former partner, expelling Akuro's spirit and freeing Kuni, but evil Kurow willfully allows it to take his body. However, this has been Kurow's plan all the time; he reveals he is a living doll of Waka, with the goal to house Akuro's spirit, such that if he is killed with Akuro inside him, Akuro would be dispelled. Chibiterasu, fighting back tears, complies with Kurow's instructions, and Akuro is destroyed forever. Kurow, just before his death, is sad about how he was nothing but a doll, however, the others reassure him that it was his adventures with Chibiterasu that made him who he really was. It was these adventures that made him more than just a doll. Kurow dies happily, surrounded by friends. Afterwards, the remainder of Chibiterasu's partners return to their homes, more confident in their abilities; Kuni leaves home to seek out who he really is, much to Susano's regret. Chibiterasu joins with Issun to return to the Celestial Plain to reunite with Waka and Amaterasu. Other characters from ≈åkami return, including Issun, Mr. and Mrs. Orange, and Sakuya. The game features locales from ≈åkami as well as new areas to explore as part of its adventure. Chibiterasu gains Celestial Brush power similar to those from ≈åkami, but instead of finding the Celestial Brush Gods hiding in constellations, the player will have to travel to where the Brush Gods have chosen to rest, and acquire the skills from the Gods' children. Development Due to poor sales, ≈åkami was considered a commercial failure on the PlayStation 2, and while it was widely believed to be one of the factors involved in the closure of its developer, Clover Studio, Hideki Kamiya, lead designer of ≈åkami, specified that producer Atsushi Inaba had had an argument with Capcom management. Kamiya commented that he had an idea in mind for the sequel and would enjoy making it, but it was nothing more than an idea and beyond his control. In July 2007, former Capcom employee Keiji Inafune commented that a Wii port was something he had considered, but it was easier said than done, and they had no plans yet. In spite of this, it received a port for the Wii. Capcom employee Chris Svensson commented that a lot more people would have to buy copies of ≈åkami to warrant a sequel's production. In August 2009, Capcom filed for a Japanese trademark on the name \\"≈åkamiden\\" for a video game, a few months prior to the Japan release of the Wii version of ≈åkami, which led to speculation about an ≈åkami sequel; ≈åkamiden may be a shortening or pun for ≈åkami Gaiden, translated as \\"≈åkami Sidestory\\", or possibly ≈åkami Densetsu, which translates to \\"≈åkami Legend\\", thus fueling speculation that it may be the long-awaited sequel. The September 2009 issue of Famitsu revealed that ≈åkamiden: Chiisaki Taiy≈ç was indeed another ≈åkami game which was slated to be released by Capcom on the Nintendo DS in 2010 in Japan, though no other release information was provided. The Famitsu article shows gameplay, including combat, and graphics similar to the PlayStation 2/Wii game. ≈åkamiden was directed by Kuniomi Matsushita, who oversaw for the Wii port of ≈åkami, and was produced by Motohide Eshiro, who had previously worked on titles such as Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny and Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth. Yukinori Kitajima, writer for the critically acclaimed Japanese Wii title, 428: Shibuya Scramble, was the scenario author for ≈åkamiden. In December 2008, Matsushita, who had a strong desire to create a sequel to ≈åkami, led a small team to develop an advanced prototype. Matsushita showed this demonstration to Eshiro and expressed his desire to go forward on the project, and the project was greenlighted. The team settled on the Nintendo DS due to its portability, allowing players to pick it up and play wherever they wish, as well as the utility of the stylus on the touch screen acting as a brush. Eshiro stated that: Eshiro further commented that he considered ≈åkamiden more of a successor to ≈åkami than a sequel, desiring to build upon the world for a franchise on the Nintendo DS platform. While ≈åkamiden is a DS title, Eshiro has considered to expand subsequent games to work with the Nintendo 3DS unit based on the game's reception. Similarly, Eshiro does not rule out a high-definition version on a modern console or a version for the iPhone or similar touch-screen devices depending on the response to ≈åkamiden. Several changes were made to the basic elements of ≈åkami to make ≈åkamiden suitable for the Nintendo DS. With fewer controls on the DS unit, the player only controls the movement of the characters in the game, with the camera set in an \\"on rails\\" manner to make sure the player was focused on the right areas to head toward. One change made from ≈åkami was the simplification of the combat system, a factor that some players had found difficult; ≈åkamiden reduces the melee weapon attack features down to a single button, but the Celestial Brush can still be used alongside this for complex strategy. While the developers could have removed the melee attacks completely, allowing the player to defeat enemies with the Celestial Brush alone, they felt that the lack of melee attacks slowed down the game, instead opting for players to melee and then finish off foes with a Celestial Brush flourish. The idea of partners and using the stylus to guide them came about through the intention of having puzzles in the game that incorporated use of the DS touchscreen. While there were significantly more Celestial Brush strokes and puzzles the team wished to add, they left these out in the final version, feeling they had added too much padding to the game. The number of polygons and the resolution of the artwork was prohibitively limited on the DS version, challenging the artists to convey similar imagery and emotions that were in the first game. The game was originally going to feature Amaterasu, the protagonist goddess-wolf character from ≈åkami; during character planning, one of the artists drew what Amaterasu's child would look like as a joke, but this spurred several ideas for Matsushita, such as the concept of a partner, and leading to Chibiterasu becoming the main character. As Chibiterasu was still a child, the team thought \\"it would take more than a child to save the world\\", according to Matsushita, and led to the inclusion of partners both in the game's story and gameplay. This option was selected over several arrangements of characters, such as having five different Chibiterasus team up as a party. Using a story taken from a child's point of view as they explore and learn new things made the game much easier to visualize (and incidentally fell in line with the core demographic of Nintendo handheld devices). Esohiro compared such a first-person narrative to the film Stand by Me. Eshiro also felt it was important to include making friends and having to say goodbye as part of this adventure, striking a strong emotional aspect to the game. As such, Chibiterasu is only paired with one partner at any one time, as Matsushita stated, \\"if you could switch between them any time you wanted, then they wouldn't be partners anymore\\". Included was the death of one of the major characters in the game, which Matsushita found necessary to improve the story's flow; the developers had looked to ≈åkami and noted while characters also died there, they did not have any emotional attachment for the player; there was resistance in the development team toward the idea of a major character dying permanently in ≈åkamiden, but it was ultimately decided it would be in service of the embiggening of the story. The game takes place nine months after the events of ≈åkami, which posed story problems for Yukinori Kitajima, ≈åkamiden's main script writer. The team originally intended to take the game several years in the future, but found by keeping a closer time frame things would not change as much from the previous game, giving a familiar feeling to those that played ≈åkami. Kitajima had to create rationale for some events, such as why no characters remember the end of ≈åkami, or why Susano's son, Kuni, is a young boy although he did not exist during the timeline of ≈åkami. ≈åkamiden was first shown in playable form at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2009, where it was reported to have been about 25% completed. Occidental releases were uncertain until it was observed that Capcom had trademarked the name ≈åkamiden in both North American and European markets. In April 2010, at its \\"Captivate\\" event, Capcom confirmed the game would be released to the aforementioned markets no later than 2011. Promotion A \\"Collector's Edition\\" of ≈åkamiden was released in Japan alongside the normal game; in addition to the game this version includes a soundtrack, a DVD, a storybook, a plush Chibiterasu keychain, and ≈åkamiden-branded earphones. A series of television advertisements in Japan for ≈åkamiden feature model Kii Kitano and a white Shiba Inu puppy named Moran-chan that bears a close resemblance to Chibiterasu. North American pre-order bonuses included an ≈åkamiden-stylized screen cleaner and brush-shaped stylus at GameStopOkami Den for Nintendo DS GameStop and a plush Chibiterasu key chain (identical to the Japanese collector's edition) at the Capcom Store.Capcom Store - Buy Okamiden Capcom Store Reception Pre-release The protagonist of ≈åkamiden, Chibiterasu, has received significant media attention for his appearance. The decision to put ≈åkamiden on the Nintendo DS has received mixed reactions. The Escapist editor John Funk stated that it was the perfect platform for the sequel, due to how the touch screen could be used effectively for the Celestial Brush. Kombo editor Daniel Sims praised ≈åkamidens cel-shaded visuals, stating that they work well on the Nintendo DS. Destructoid editor Hamza Aziz believed it was perfect for the Nintendo DS. Aziz added that he was impressed with Capcom managing to retain ≈åkamis stylized appearance in the sequel. Siliconera editor Ishaan Sahdev, however, was skeptical that ≈åkamiden could replicate the feel that ≈åkami provided, due to how much it relied on its visuals and art style to bring players into its world. He also criticized the reasoning behind placing it on the Nintendo DS, which was to reach a larger audience, calling the visuals terrible. He later questioned whether its faults may hurt it enough that the project may not even have been worth it. Kotaku editor Luke Plunkett expressed disappointment that it was a Nintendo DS game rather than a PlayStation 3 game. There has been skepticism about developing ≈åkamiden without PlatinumGames, a developer featuring key members of Clover Studio, including Hideki Kamiya, the developer behind ≈åkami. MTV editor John Constantine worried about this, questioning whether the lack of Kamiya and PlatinumGames would make the game feel like a rehash. Demos of ≈åkamiden, both of the Japanese version at the Tokyo Game Show in 2009 and the English- language version at various events in the United States was positively received by critics. Kotaku editors Stephan Totilo and Brian Crecente praised the demo versions they played in April and May 2010; Totilo considered the game a strong match for the DS and was not only \\"a kind of game made for the DS\\" but also \\"the kind of game for which [he] thought the DS was made\\", while Crecente believed that the drawing mechanism from ≈åkami worked even better in ≈åkamiden due to the use of the stylus and the nature of holding the portable console like a book. Daniel Feit of Wired believed that while the graphics were not as good as the original game on the PlayStation 2, the \\"cartoony graphics are well suited to the Nintendo DS\\". IGN described the character of Chibiterasu as \\"adorable\\". Destructoid editor Jim Sterling concurred, joking that its cuteness would make ≈åkamiden one of the greatest Nintendo DS games ever made. Luke Plunkett commented that despite his reservations for ≈åkamiden, his \\"heart melted\\" when he saw Chibiterasu. During E3 2010 ≈åkamiden received a great deal of praise and awards from news outlets. It was nominated for \\"Best Handheld Game\\" for the Game Critics Awards, and \\"Best DS Game\\" by IGN. GameSpy named it their \\"DS Game of Show\\". Release Famitsu rated ≈åkamiden a total score of 34 out of 40 points. The reviewers praised the ability to bring in the elements of ≈åkami to the DS, but noted that there was little surprise as there was with ≈åkami as the DS version covers many of the same elements of story and gameplay. The Famitsu reviewers did note that the gameplay was not expanded far from the original ≈åkami, but posit that it \\"just shows how complete a package ≈åkami was in the first place.\\" ≈åkamiden was the third best- selling video game in Japan during its release week at 84,472 copies sold. The game sold an additional 12,829 copies the following week, dropping to number 13 on the charts. GameZone gave the game a 7/10, stating: \\"There are some players who will undoubtedly love ≈åkamiden, either because the flaws (such as backtracking) are not as familiar or because they have the capacity to overlook its myriad mistakes. I wish I could do the same.\\" Notes References External links * ≈åkamiden: Chiisaki Taiy≈ç official Japanese website Category:2010 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Capcom games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo DS-only games Category:≈åkami Category:Single-player video games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games based on Japanese mythology Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in feudal Japan Category:Video games with cel-shaded animation ","title":"≈åkamiden"},{"id":"24190646","text":"Maksim Andreyevich Zhestokov (; born 19 June 1991) is a Russian football defender who plays for Akron Tolyatti.

It was released along with \\"Fotos y Recuerdos\\" in January 1995, serving as its B-side track. Written by Ricky Vela, \\"El Chico del Apartamento 512\\" is a cumbia song with influences of Colombian and South American music. Lyrically, the song describes a female protagonist who knocks on her love interest's apartment door (number 512) and is heartbroken when his sister (who she initially mistakes for his girlfriend) answers it. Justino Aguilar of Billboard magazine, called \\"El Chico del Apartamento 512\\" as one of Selena's \\"most memorable songs\\". The track posthumously peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard Regional Mexican Digital Songs chart in 2011.  Background and composition  \\"El Chico del Apartamento 512\\" was written by Ricky Vela, the keyboardist of Selena y Los Dinos. The song was co-written by Selena's brother-producer A.B. Quintanilla who, along with Argentine musician Bebu Silvetti, served as producers. Musicologist Howard Blumenthal called the song's production \\"perfect\\" in his book The World Music CD Listener's Guide (1998). \\"El Chico del Apartamento 512\\" is a Spanish-language cumbia with influences of Colombian and South American music. Vela said in a 2002 interview that the track was \\"the least Tejano music song\\" because of its musically diverse sounds. Musicologists Ilan Stavans and Harold Augenbraum called the song \\"brassy\\" and noticed how the lyrics are constructed in story- song form. The \\"512\\" in the song's title is a reference to Corpus Christi, Texas' former area code. The recording is written in the key of C major and is played in a moderate groove of 102 beats per minute. It incorporates music from several musical instruments, including the French horn, violin and piano. \\"El Chico del Apartamento 512\\" is musically similar to Selena's 1994 single \\"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\\"; author James E. Perone called them recurring themes where the protagonist is \\"attracted to a young man\\". Lyrically, Selena is heartbroken after knocking on her love interest's apartment door (number 512) and mistaking his sister for his girlfriend, before the sister asks \\"are you looking for my brother?\\". Italian essayists Gaetano Prampolini and Annamaria Pinazzi called the song a \\"funny love reversal\\".  Critical reception and legacy  Justino Aguilar of Billboard magazine, called \\"El Chico del Apartamento 512\\" as one of her \\"most memorable songs\\". \\"El Chico del Apartamento 512\\" was later reworked and included on Selena's posthumously released remix/duet album Enamorada de Ti (2012). Writer Joey Guerra of the San Antonio Express-News, called it a \\"bouncy cumbia\\" that was \\"taken down a few notches to a chirpy midtempo.\\" and wrote that the new sound is \\"not bad, but it loses a lot of the melody's force.\\" Guerra believed American entertainer Selena Gomez (who was featured on \\"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\\" for the album) should have been used on \\"El Chico del Apartamento 512\\" instead. Domingo Banda of the Semana News called \\"El Chico del Apartamento 512\\" a \\"relaxed reggae\\" track. Brian Galindo of BuzzFeed called \\"El Chico del Apartamento 512\\" danceable and \\"catchy\\". Selena performed the song on her final performance on March 19, 1995 during the Calle Ocho Festival in Miami, which attracted over 100,000 fans. Selena was shot and killed by Yolanda Sald√≠var, her friend and former manager of the singer's Selena Etc. clothing boutiques, on March 31, 1995. The song is still played at events throughout Texas.

The building houses the Franklin Museum which is dedicated to preserving the building and its primary function. The college building was placed on the National Register on May 8, 1987. History John Walker, an abolitionist and Presbyterian Church minister, established Alma College in New Athens in 1818. The primary function of the college was to promote religion and abolitionist beliefs in the area. The college was renamed Franklin College in 1825, but the college kept its original mission. Over the span of operations the college operated out of several buildings around New Athens. Over the course of over 100 years, the college was key in the education of two governors, eight U.S. Senators, and nine U.S. Congressmen and twenty state legislators. The college also graduated Titus Basfield, an African-American student and former slave, as well as several prominent women.http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=3091&nm;=Franklin- Museum-of-New-Athens-Inc The college slowly dwindled until only one building remained, which ceased operations in 1919, due to a decrease in enrollment. The building became affiliated with Muskingum College in New Concord from 1919 until 1927. The New Athens School District purchased the building and operated the high school in the building from 1927 to 1971, the middle school from 1971 to 1987, after which it sat vacant. The Franklin Museum purchased the building in 1992 and opened the building as a museum. Exterior The current building, number 5 of the original college layout, sits on a slight hill overlooking Main Street below. The building dates from 1900, after the original log structure burned down in 1899. The building was designed by Joseph W. Yost of the firm Yost & Packard, and consists of red bricks with white wood trim boards. The main building is shaped like a \\"U\\", with the wings facing the street. The recessed main entrance is located in the center of the \\"U\\" and is framed by four Corinthian columns supporting an entablature and a pediment. The entablature is emblazoned with a nameplate reading \\"Franklin Museum\\". The pediment above contains dentil molding with a frieze containing \\"1900\\". The wooden double doors are topped by a transom light. Above this entrance is a square window with sandstone quoins. The building rests upon rusticated sandstone blocks with small rectangular windows illuminating the bottom floor. The first and second floors contain large rectangular windows with sandstone casings. On either side of the entrance are three double-sashed windows. The wing projections each contain a palladian window on the main floor with three windows above.

Location The town of Los Otates, is located in the town of Actopan, in the central Veracruz state, its coordinates are 19¬∞ 31' 13.36\\" north of latitude and 96¬∞ 42' 54.87\\" west, and is at 540 meters above sea level. It has 1174 inhabitants (2006 census), of which 94% of the population is Catholic, 4% other religions and 2% belongs to none. Los Otates has all public services, drinking water, street lighting, garbage collection, paving, health center, church, library, cellular telephone service, public transport, schools and recreation areas. History In ancient times, Los Otates was inhabited by a group of Totonacas. Archaeological remains have been found in la Capilla. Many of these archaeological pieces are made of ceramic (pottery) and obsidian stone (spears). In colonial times, in 1579 Xalapa neighbor Sebastian Diaz requested of the viceroy to acquire a ranch for beef cattle in the region of Chicu, Actopan and Atexcan. In 1600 this ranch was donated to Paul Gutierrez, Tecamachalco neighbor and later power passed to Don Roque de Cevallos Gutierrez, owner of Trapiche de la Concepcion (La Concha). Roque's heirs brought the ranch into bankruptcy as a result of loans from the church, drought, diseases and death of slaves and cattle. In 1692 the Holy Inquisition court recovered all assets of the mill of the Conception and it passed into the hands of the nuns of the convent of San Jeronimo in the city of Puebla. That same year Don Francisco Dominguez Muniz acquired this property, among others, to be used as a site for livestock called Ca√±ada de los Otates. The Dominguez family retained the property until the grandchildren of Francisco Dominguez divided up their inheritance and each sold his share, except Catarina de la Oliva Dominguez who is left her part of about half site to the people who worked on the Otates estate. People with the surnames Palmeros, Barradas, Ortiz and others who disappeared from the area, were Spanish descendants. Later other surnames entered the area: Salazar, Rodriguez, √Åvila, Lopez, Callejas, among others. All of these are surnames of families that currently make up the Otates population. By 1899, owing to reform laws, the government took control of the land and awarded Los Otates to Don Ortega Crescencio. Upon Crescencio's death the people at that time bought the field from his widow for $250. Don Juan Barradas, Jos√© Salazar and Don Jose de la Paz Avila came up with this sum. Church of Santa Rosa de Lima. Religion The church was built in 1766 and resembled a wooden shrine. It also has the oldest bell. Later on and after the death of Catherine the people built a concrete chapel with tiled-roof. The tower was built in 1879 and extended in 1945 and 1946. The domes were also built. In 1973 Santa Rosa de Lima was named as its patron saint. In the early 1990s the church was remodeled preserving the original facade. Besides Otates, the priest also served the Trapiche del Rosario, San Nicolas, Omiquila, Los Frailes, El Zetal, Coyolillo and Bureau of Guadalupe congregations, among others. Blessing of Bread, in 2007, Otates. Since 1738 a feast has been celebrated every August 30 in honor of Santa Rosa de Lima, the patron saint. This date is also celebrated as heritage day for the land which used to belong to Catherine de la Oliva Dominguez. November 13 is also celebrated as the feast of bread in honor of San Diego de Alcal√°, a celebration that has gained a lot of popularity over the years given the large amount of bread that is prepared to share with family and friends. Education The first school was built around 1870 and served the community for a long time. In 1973 the new elementary school classroom was built and its first entrants graduated in 1976. By 1977 a High-school was opened, its construction having begun in 1974. In 1975 the school began its Bachillerato program in a provisional building that was previously used as a public laundry. By 1977, the Otates Public Library was established and on occasions it provided training in tailoring, baking, pastry making and fruit growing, among others. Previously the kindergarten had been started in 1983, the institution having been previously built and later inaugurated on 19 September 1985. In 2006 the process to relocate Bachillerato program was started and it is currently being in a school building close to the secondary school. Other facilities The cemetery was built around 1970 and the health center in 1976. Tourist attractions The Descabezadero This is the source of the Actopan river. It is a beautiful place, full of vegetation and fauna, where the river flows over a cliff. Visitors can descend the cliff while rafting and abseiling (rapelling). The river empties into the Gulf of Mexico at Chachalacas. Poza Azul This is a \\"lake\\" of very clear blue water, from which a small river flows, which connects to the Actopan River 1.5 km downstream. The Chapel The Chapel is located in the mountain close to Los Otates. The first stone for its construction was laid on 1 November 1902 and it was completed in 1907. In around 1945 there was a fire in the area which burned the wood structure and the tile roof. During the rebuilding the temple was also extended. This chapel was built to serve as a school run by the Missionaries of St Joseph. During the revolution the missionaries had to leave and did not return. Agriculture Los Otates' agriculture is based on the production of mango and chayote (also known as christophene, cho-cho) for sale within Mexico as well as exported internationally. Other crops such as tomatoes, maize, beans and sugarcane are produced to a lesser extent. On the drive leading into Los Otates large fields with all kinds crops are visible.  Flora and fauna  There is a wide variety of flora in Los Otates. \\"Patancan\\" cactus, \\"nacasle\\" (nacastle), acacia, tamarisk and mango in addition to some fine woods such as cedar, mahogany and a variety of mangroves are present. There are various types of birds such as quail, calandria, torcacita (tortolita), owl, zopilote, paloma, chachalaca, sparrowhawk, among others. There is also a wide variety of wildlife animals, including different kinds of snakes such as the bell, and the serpiente coral (coralillo), a large population of rabbits, raccoons, false coral, nauyaca, lizards, iguana and others.

It was written by The Algerian scholar Ahmad al-Buni who was born in algeria he wrote it in Ayyubid Egypt, who died around 1225 CE (622 AH). The Shams al-Ma'arif is generally regarded as the most influential textbook of its type in the Arab world,Owen Davies, Grimoires: A History of Magic Books, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 27 and is arguably as important as, if not more than, the Picatrix in both hemispheres. In contemporary form the book consists of two volumes; Shams al-Ma'arif al-Kubra and Shams al- Ma'arif al-Sughra, the former being the larger of the two.Shamsu al-Ma‚Äòaref al-Kubrah, Al Nour Library, Beirut, Lebanon: 2006.Shamsu al-Ma‚Äòaref al-Sughra, Al Nour Library, Beirut, Lebanon: 2005. The first few chapters introduce the reader to magic squares, and the combination of numbers and the alphabet that are believed to bring magical effect, which the author insists is the only way to communicate with jinn, angels and spirits. The table of contents that were introduced in the later printed editions of the work contain a list of unnumbered chapters (fa·π£l), which stretch to a number of 40. However, prior to the printing press and various other standardisations, there were three independent volumes that circulated, each one differing in length.Francis Maddison, Emilie Savage-Smith, Ralph H. Pinder-Wilson, Tim Stanley, Science, Tools And Magic Vol. 12, Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 65 While being popular, it also carries a reputation for being suppressed and banned for much of Islamic history,Michael Ipgrave, Scriptures in Dialogue: Christians and Muslims Studying the Bible and the Qur'an Together, Church Publishing Inc, 2004, p. 42 but still flourishes in being read and studied up to the present day. Many Sufi orders, such as the Naqshbandi-Haqqani order have recognised its legitimacy and use as a compendium for the occult, and hold it in high regard. Another title by the same author, namely Manba' Usool al-Hikmah (\\"The Source of the Essentials of Wisdom\\"), is considered its companion text. Translations Although full-volume translations into English are not known, there have been numerous renditions of a few of the more popular rituals found within the main treatise, as well as those that lie in its accompanying text. Some of these rituals have had various degrees of notability, but one of recurring presence in many publications is that of the BirhatiyaWahid Azal, The Birhatiya Conjuration Oath & the meaning of its first 28 names, N.U.R.-Fatimiya Sufi Order, 2008Nineveh Shadrach, Magic That Works: Practical Training for the Children of Light, Ishtar Publishing, 2005, p. 228Nineveh Shadrach, Ancient Magick Conjuration of Power: Beginners Guide to the Berhatiah, Ishtar Publishing, 2011 (also known as The Ancient Oath or Red SulphurNineveh Shadrach, Magic That Works: Practical Training for the Children of Light, Ishtar Publishing, 2005, p. 48).

The software is designed to analyze both saturated and unsaturated flow through the ground through the solving of Richard's equation. The program is used in the fields of civil engineering and hydrology in order to analyze seepage and groundwater regional flow. The software is used for the calculation of flow rates, pore-water pressures, and pumping rates associated with regional groundwater flow. The software can be coupled with CHEMFLUX in order to calculate diffusion, advection, and decay rates or with SVHEAT in order to calculate thermal gradients and freeze/thaw fronts. Methodology SVFLUX makes use of a general finite element solver to solve the Richards equation for both saturated and unsaturated flow. The finite element solver makes use of automatic mesh generation and automatic mesh refinement in order to aid in problem solution. The software has been used on large projects including the Questa Weathering Study which examined the flow regime through waste rock piles. Several forms of the flow governing equation are implemented in the software which provides greater flexibility in solving unique flow situations. The user enters geometry, material properties, and analysis constraints through a CAD-type graphical user interface (GUI). The results may also be viewed in the context of a graphical user interface. The geometry is simply entered as regions which may be drawn, pasted in from Excel, or imported from AutoCAD DXF files. The factor of safety for a specific failure surface is computed as the forces driving failure along the surface divided by the shear resistance of the soils along the surface. A library of benchmark models are distributed with the software. Features The developers of SVFLUX have implemented all of the classic features traditionally found in seepage analysis software as well as an interesting list of new features. The following is a list of some of the more distinct features of SVFLUX: * Probabilistic analysis * Unsaturated analysis with improved convergence * Coupled climatic boundary conditions and calculation of actual evaporation (AE) * Automatic mesh generation * Automatic mesh refinement * Support for parallel processing * Large library of example models * Simple and intuitive graphical user interface Classic features also supported by the software include: * Right-click application of boundary conditions and properties * Help system and tutorial manual * Solution for saturated and unsaturated flow * Regional groundwater analysis * Plotting of flowlines and streamtraces * Reporting of fluxes References External links * SoilVision Systems Ltd.

In 1985, she was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship.Ron Pen, \\"Lily May Ledford.\\" Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), p. 1181. Biography Early life and career Ledford was born along the banks of the Red River in rural Powell County, Kentucky in 1917. She was the seventh of fourteen children born to tenant farmer Daw White Ledford and wife Stella May Tackett. Her father taught her to play banjo at a young age, and by age 12 she had learned to play the fiddle. Lily loved the traditional dance tunes, and she often had to sneak off to play at area dances, as her mother considered this type of music to be \\"old drunkard songs\\".Cari Norris, Kentucky Folkweb (ed.), Lily May Ledford as Traditional Artist -- excerpt. 1998. Retrieved: 2009-09-01. In 1936, Ledford won a music competition at Mount Vernon, Kentucky, and the following year made her radio debut on WLS Chicago's National Barn Dance. Shortly after this appearance, she was recruited by John Lair for his new radio program, Renfro Valley Barn Dance, which was initially broadcast from Cincinnati and later moved to Mount Vernon. Ledford and Lair formed the Coon Creek Girls, with Lair providing the band's name, even though there was no such place as Coon Creek, as it was typical for early country music producers to give bands colorful rural- sounding names. The Coon Creek Girls originally consisted of Ledford on banjo and vocals, Ledford's sister Rosie on guitar, Evelyn Daisy Lange on bass, and Esther Violet Koehler on mandolin. The band made its radio debut on October 9, 1937. Lange and Koehler left in 1939, and were replaced by Ledford's sister, Minnie. The group performed at the White House in 1939 for President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his guests, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.Folk, Country Music Pioneer Lily May Ledford Dies.

Delighted by the positive response she received from the folk music movement, Ledford became a regular at folk festivals across the U.S. and Canada, initially with her sisters, and then as a solo artist when her sisters were unable to join her. In 1971, she appeared at the \\"Man and His World Festival\\" in Montreal, and she played at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C. the following year. In 1976, Ledford toured the Western U.S. and Canada with Mike Seeger's Old-Time Music Festival. In 1979, while on tour with the Red Clay Ramblers, Ledford recorded an album, Banjo Pickin' Girl, that was released on the Greenhays label in 1983. Around the same period, she appeared at the Mariposa Folk Festival in Orillia. In the early 1980s, author Loyal Jones interviewed Ledford extensively as part of research conducted with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, and broadcast the interviews on National Public Radio. In 1980, Berea College published Coon Creek Girl, an autobiography Ledford had written in the late 1970s. Ledford stopped performing in 1983, when she was diagnosed with lung cancer. Just before her death in 1985, she was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. Ledford inspired a generation of younger folk musicians, including Pete Seeger. Repertoire Ledford typically played a five-string banjo in the frailing, or \\"clawhammer\\" style taught to her by her father. She also occasionally played the fiddle. Notable recordings include versions of the old world ballad \\"Pretty Polly\\" and folk songs such as \\"Darling Cory\\", \\"Jim Along Josey,\\" and \\"Kitty Clyde\\". Her fiddle recordings include a rendition of the folk song \\"Cackling Hen\\".Berea College Sound Archives . Online database search 2009-09-01. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Ledford played at a relatively leisurely pace, often stopping to give extensive background information about the songs she was playing.

Hogan. The film stars Richard Arlen, Jean Parker and Helen Mack.Wynne 1987, p. 172. Power Dive was the first film from the producing team of Pine-Thomas Productions, former press agents who had a producing unit at Paramount. Plot Ace test pilot Bradley Farrell (Richard Arlen), flying for McMasters Aviation Corp., breaks his leg when an overweight prototype crashes. Brad's younger brother Douglas (Don Castle), a recent graduate in aeronautical engineering, thinks Doug's flying is too dangerous and is hired as a design engineer at McMasters. Carol Blake (Jean Parker) wants to interest Brad in her father's design for an aircraft made of plastic. Doug pretends to be Brad because he is attracted to her but Brad meets Carol and takes her out flying. She introduces him to her blind father, Professor Blake (Thomas W. Ross), resulting in Brad becoming immersed in the professor's new designs. Brad's friend, Johnny Coles (Louis Jean Heydt), loses his life test flying his own, similar design, that breaks apart in the air, leaving behind his wife and child. Despite his friend's death, Brad convinces the company to build Blake's \\"geodetic\\" aircraft design, with his brother put in charge of the project. After Brad returns from setting a new cross-country speed record, he proposes to Carol, but she is in love with Doug. Doug doesn't know Carol's true feelings and with the test of the professor's aircraft imminent, he is at odds with Brad over the new aircraft's design. Brad has to fly the aircraft for US Army officials but is worried that the heavy test equipment will make the aircraft dangerous to fly. Doug will fly with him on the test and when a 9g power dive is scheduled, Doug passes out. The test equipment breaks free, jamming the rudder. Brad forces Doug to parachute to safety, and then cuts the rudder wires, grabbing them with his bare hands. He manages to land the aircraft safely although his hands are cut badly. With the aircraft accepted, Brad gives up test flying to become a vice- president of McMasters Aviation. Doug and Carol find happiness and marry.

Thomas, former press agents and then associate producers at Paramount. Pine and Thomas both worked in publicity--Pine was head of publicity for Paramount and Thomas was his assistant. They teamed with another publicist, Maxwell Shane, who was a writer. They decided to make lower budgeted films that did not have the overhead of the studios. They talked with Richard Arlen, who had joined Paramount. Arlen became famous with Wings and suggested an aviation film. Arlen owned several planes and ran an aviation school; he offered himself and his aircraft for a movie. Pine and Thomas selected three titles, Power Dive, Forced Landing and Flying Blind, and wrote scripts around them. They went to Paramount and said they had a star and three scripts and asked for a distribution deal. Paramount agreed, enabling Pine and Thomas to get loans from the bank to finance the films. Power Drive was made in ten days at a cost of $86,000 and earned almost a million dollars. They saved money by shooting on location.WILLIAM THOMAS, 80; PRODUCER OF LOW-BUDGET '40S ACTION FILMS Burr Van Atta. Philadelphia Inquirer 6 Apr 1984: E.2. Thomas produced the first film while Pine was an associate--he worked for Cecil B. De Mille. All three films cost under $90,000 and returned six times its negative cost. Paramount was so pleased with these results that it offered to finance the duo's films from then on.

The story concerns a young woman raised in an unwholesome environment who joins a confidence racket run by one of her mother's friends. She agrees to marry the victim of one of her scams, becomes a war widow, and is left to raise a baby, but abandons it each evening to go out dancing. After the child suffers an accident in her absence, she is charged with child neglect and loses custody. She mends her ways by devotedly caring for an abandoned infant and meets up again with the con man, who has also reformed after a prison stint, and together they build a new life. The film was the last work of director Santell and the last leading role for actor Dunn. In 2018 a re-mastered and restored print by Paramount Pictures, The Film Foundation, and Martin Scorsese was screened at the Museum of Modern Art as part of the museum's program of showcasing 30 restored films from the library of Republic Pictures, curated by Scorsese. Plot On Mother's Day 1946, a woman known as Ziggy Brennan looks back on her life. Eight years earlier, her vain and corrupt mother Natalie asks Ziggy to pretend they are sisters. Together they trick men out of money. Ziggy takes a liking to a con artist, Denny Reagan, and steals a sailor's watch that Denny admires. The watch's inscription, showing it is a gift from the boy's mother, gives Denny a guilty conscience, so Ziggy returns it to Mart Neilson, the sailor. He asks her on a date, which leads to marriage. Two days later Neilson is shipped off to war. He is killed in action while Ziggy is pregnant with their child. Ziggy is warned by Natalie after the birth of baby Martha that she is not fit for motherhood. Denny is now doing time in a penitentiary, so he is no help either. Ziggy likes to go out dancing every night, leaving Martha with an irresponsible young babysitter. While the babysitter sneaks out to be with her boyfriend, Martha tumbles out of her crib and is nearly strangled by the bedsheets. A landlady's testimony results in the baby being sent to a juvenile ward. Ziggy is given a suspended sentence for child neglect, but is forbidden from having contact with her child. Denny's mother tracks down Ziggy and encourages her to pray for salvation. By the time Denny leaves prison, he is a reformed man. He tracks down Ziggy and finds that she has taken in an abandoned infant found in a local church and is caring for it, having named him Denny. Together they appeal to the court for a second chance, then leave together with both children, united as a family.

Duprez, typically viewed by film producers as \\"an Oriental princess type\\", was cast as \\"a hardboiled and rowdy mother\\". Mona Freeman was cast in the lead role of Ziggy after an extensive talent search. In December 1945, director Alfred Santell returned from a New York trip during which he tested dozens of actresses; he was said to be looking for \\"some girl who looked like Lana Turner or Gene Tierney and could act like Sylvia Sidney\\". Freeman, aged 21, was ultimately signed, having played mostly juvenile parts in her short film career. Martha as a 3-year-old was played by Colette Granlund from Mendocino County. She was spotted by a talent scout while visiting San Francisco's Golden Gate Park with her parents. Filming Production took place between late April and early June 1946. Much of the shooting took place on location in the streets and harbor of San Francisco. The actors blended in with passersby and were filmed in street scenes by a hidden camera enclosed in a truck trailing slowly behind them, and in sidewalk close-ups by a camera hidden in a baby carriage. Unable to find a suitable house in San Francisco, the film crew used a stately Old California home in Pasadena for the scene in which the racketeers carry out an expensive sofa into their truck. Dunn's mother died in Los Angeles during the filming, with Dunn at her side. Release The film was released on December 23, 1946. In 1951, the film was re-edited and re-released under the title Tough Girl. Critical reception Critics generally praised the acting and direction but decried the plot and script, characterizing it as a \\"seamy-side melodrama\\" and \\"a run-of-the-mill problem melodrama\\". The Chicago Tribune wrote: \\"Jimmy Dunn does as well as anyone could, considering the plot and the script, and Mona Freeman is appealing, but the whole business is leaden and definitely second class fare\\". The St. Louis Globe Democrat found it difficult to make sense of the story and its message. Ziggy starts out earning audience sympathy for her difficult upbringing, but loses it by accepting her mother's advice that \\"the path of easy virtue is the easy way\\". Denny is at the same time a racketeer and \\"a likeable Irishman who is ever so good to his mother\\". After Ziggy suffers for her hedonistic lifestyle and Denny serves time in prison, their reunion seems to convey that \\"their romance should be both logical and appealing\\". The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called Dunn's performance \\"restrained and believable ‚Ä¶ [b]ut this role doesn't give him a chance to show the stuff he did in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\". Similarly, The San Francisco Examiner commended Dunn for being \\"more than adequate in an inadequate role\\". Freeman's performance received harsher scrutiny in light of the extremes of personality she was required to play. The Baltimore Sun wrote: > Miss Freeman looks lovely, innocent, and very young, at all times. This is > remarkable when you consider that she has to impersonate a thief, a devoted > young mother, a brazen mantrap, an industrious housewife, a shoplifter, a > war widow, a bar butterfly, a confidence woman and a specimen of fine > womanhood, and all within 95 minutes. The only way Republic could get this > role played right would be to have Katharine Cornell, Helen Hayes, June > Havoc and Ina Claire do it in relays. Even then we wouldn't like it. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram wrote: \\"Miss Freeman should get A-plus for her sincere attempt to play a bad girl. Fine features, a sensitive face and a touch of gentleness about her makes it doubtful casting. A tougher brat would have filled the role better\\". The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette panned Freeman's acting as \\"immature\\". At the same time, it gave kudos to the performances of actresses June Duprez, Dorothy Vaughn, and Rosalind Ivan, calling the latter's portrayal of the landlady \\"excellent\\". The Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph also singled out actresses who played minor characters ‚Äì including the babysitter (Shirley Mills in an uncredited role), two lonely women, and an assortment of neighbors ‚Äì for praise. Santell's direction received positive mention in several reviews. The Los Angeles Times called the film \\"reminiscent of the late '20's in direction (by Old-Timer Alfred Santell) and 'feel'\\". The Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph complimented Santell's \\"minor directorial flourishes\\", adding, \\"As a matter of fact, his contribution alone puts the picture into the general category of worth seeing\\". The Minneapolis Star called George Antheil's score \\"outstanding\\". Restoration A re-mastered, restored print of That Brennan Girl by Paramount Pictures, The Film Foundation, and Martin Scorsese was screened at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in February 2018. The screening was the first in a two-part series titled Martin Scorsese Presents Republic Rediscovered: New Restorations from Paramount Pictures, which showcased 30 restored films from the library of Republic Pictures. The restoration was released on the Apple TV app the following year. The MoMA website calls the film \\"[u]naccountably overlooked\\" and a \\"resonant, formally inventive film\\". According to The Village Voice, the work displays a host of Santell's creative directorial touches, such as \\"scenes played in silhouette, in pantomime as the camera watches through a window, on two or three levels of a staircase in a couple of scenes reminiscent of The Magnificent Ambersons\\". This report concluded that the film demonstrated \\"the kind of creativity that once flourished at Republic\\".

It was in Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred it to Oxfordshire. Eaton Hastings was once much larger than it is today, when it can be seen as an all-but-deserted medieval village. The 2001 Census gave the parish population as 81. Parish church The Church of England parish church of Saint Michael and All Angels is the most prominent surviving building of the original settlement. The earliest parts of the church were built in the 11th century. It is built of rubblestone and consists of a simple nave, chancel and bellcote. The chancel is largely 13th century. In 1870‚Äì1873 the church underwent Victorian restoration. St Michael's is a Grade II* listed building. The west window has a stained glass depicting archangels Michael, Raphael and Gabriel. The window was installed in 1935 by Morris & Co. The designs date from 1860 and were created by William Morris and Ford Madox Brown. The north side of the chancel contains another Morris & Co. stained glass window representing St Matthew. This was installed in 1872‚Äì1874, having been designed by Edward Burne-Jones. Alexander Henderson, 1st Baron Faringdon is buried in the churchyard; the angel on his tomb was sculpted by George Frampton. Next to the church is the former rectory, which was built in the 19th century. Economic and social history The original village developed around the parish church, which remains along with a few scattered dwellings around it. The population started to decline after 1349, so that by the 19th century it consisted only of a few scattered farmhouses. The depopulation has been attributed variously and at various times to bubonic plague, to emparking and to sheep farming. Late in the 19th century, a group of houses was built on the Lechlade to Faringdon road. They were designed by the architect Ernest George for Alexander Henderson, 1st Baron Faringdon, as part of a social improvement project. Many people now regard this as Eaton Hastings, but the remaining buildings of the original settlement are hidden down a single-lane road.

He is thought to have flourished around the middle of the 5th-century BC. He was younger than Lasus of Hermione (Plut. Mus. p. 1141, c.), and younger than Diagoras of Melos. He was a contemporary of the comic poet Pherecrates. He lived for some time at the court of Archelaus of Macedon, and died there in around 412 BC. His high reputation as a poet is intimated by Xenophon, who makes Aristodemus give him first place among dithyrambic poets, alongside Homer, Sophocles, Polykleitos and Zeuxis, as the chief masters in their respective arts (Xenoph. Mem. i. 4. ¬ß. 3), and by Plutarch, who mentions him, with Simonides and Euripides, as among the most distinguished masters of music (Non posse suav. vivi sec. Epic. 1095d). Melanippides did not, however, escape the censures which the old comic poets so often heap upon their lyric contemporaries for their corruption of the severe beauties of the ancient music. Pherecrates places him at the head of such offenders and charges him with relaxing and softening the ancient music by increasing the chords of the lyre to twelve (or perhaps ten) and thus paving the way for the further licences introduced by Cinesias, Phrynis, and Timotheus of Miletus (Plut. de Mus. p. 1141, as explained and corrected by Meineke, Frag. Com. Grace, pp. 326‚Äì335). According to Aristotle, he altogether abandoned the antistrophic arrangement, and introduced long preludes (anabolai) in which the union, which was considered essential in ancient times, between music and the words of poetry, seems to have been severed (Aristot. Rhet. iii. 9). Plutarch (or the author of the essay on music which bears his name) said that in his flute-music he subverted the old arrangement by which the flute-player was hired and trained by the poet, and was entirely subordinate to him (De Mus. I. c.). But there is probably some mistake in this, as the fragment of Pherecrates, which the author quotes in confirmation of his statement, contains not a word about flute-music, but attacks only the alterations in the lyre. On the other hand, Athenaeus cites a passage from the Marsyas of Melanippides, which seems to show that he rejected and despised flute-music altogether (Athen. xiv. p. 616, e.). According to the Suda, Melanippides wrote lyric songs and dithyrambs. Several verses of his poems are still preserved. The titles of the poems Marsyas, Persephone and The Dana√Ødes have misled Fabricius and others into the supposition that Melanippides was a tragic poet, a mistake which has been made with respect to the titles of the dithyrambs of other poets. The fragments are collected by Bergk (Poet. Lyr. Graec. pp. 847‚Äì850). We learn from Meleager of Gadara (v. 7) that some of the hymns of Melanippides had a place in his Garland.

Lelewel Palace was built in 1755 by Efraim Szreger on an estate documented to have been property of King John III Sobieski and maintaining the original Corps de logis. The client and owner until 1787 was Constance Lelewel n√©e Jauch.  History  The original timber manor house of Krzysztof Gembicki, Grand Pantler of the Crown, that occupied the allotment was burned by Swedish and Brandenburgian forces during the Deluge. In 1662 it was replaced by another timber mansion of Stanis≈Çaw Razicki, the king's secretary. The more permanent brick palace was erected between 1739-1740 for Aleksander Szembek, voivode of Sieradz. It was constructed as a French-style city palace with two outbuildings and a geometric garden. Around 1755 the palace was enlarged for the subsequent proprietor Swedish-Prussian aristocrat Heinrich L√∂lh√∂ffel von L√∂wensprung (1705-1763), but of the planned two new wings only the northern wing was built. The new wing, connected with existing outbuildings and a neighbouring tenement house, become the main building of the palace. Miodowa street in the year 1770 by Bernardo Belotto, il Canaletto, displaying left-hand at the very end of the street in front of the Krasinski Palace the Lelewel Palace The real initiator of the reconstruction was Constance Jauch (1722‚Äì1802), the daughter of major general Joachim Daniel von Jauch (1668‚Äì1745). In 1741 she married Heinrich L√∂lh√∂ffel, the privy councillor (Hofrat) and physician to King Augustus III of Poland. After the death of her father, who had been German architect in attendance to King Augustus II the Strong and his son Augustus III, and who had supervised the baroque development of the city of Warsaw, she inherited a considerable fortune. Efraim Szreger had been an assistant to him, presumably the reason why he was chosen as architect. Constance Lelewel bought the former property of the voivode Franciszek Szembek at the corner of Miodowa and D≈Çuga Street in 1752, and in 1755 commissioned Szreger to build the Lelewel Palace in the Miodowa. It is documented in contemporary maps that the estate had belonged to King John III Sobieski, but this is questioned by some authors for stylistic reasons regarding the original construction. After the early death of her husband, in 1763, Constance lived in the palace until 1787, when she sold it to a rich merchant Henryk Jarzewicz. Jarzewicz enlarged and rebuilt the complex in neoclassical style according to a design by Szymon Bogumi≈Ç Zug. Between 1850-1851 the separate buildings of the complex were merged and rebuilt for Lesser family. In the 19th century the original corps de logis, so-called Szembek Mansion, was pulled down and during the World War II the whole complex was completely destroyed by the Germans.  Architecture  Szreger kept the original corps de logis (Szembek Mansion), and adjoined the front building and the side wings modelling the ensemble on the French H√¥tel particulier which was known to him from the books of Pierre-Jean Mariette (1727 and 1738) and Jacques-Fran√ßois Blondel (1752). The drawings of the exterior and the interior are well-preserved. For the staircase he designed wall paintings which differ only in marginal details from the wall paintings in the staircase of the Appartement des Princes in the Palace of Versailles which will have been well known in Poland through engravings in the third volume of 1738 of Mariette's L'Architecture fran√ßaise. The left wing of the ensemble was added by the architect Szymon Bogumi≈Ç Zug after Constance Jauch had sold the estate. The construction is relevant for the history of architecture in Poland because it shows the influence of the baroque style of the Saxon building authority for which Szreger was working until he emerged as the most important exponent of neoclassical architecture in Poland.

Biography Cuyjet's formal dance training began in the 1930s with Essie Marie Dorsey, who was responsible for initiating formal classical ballet training to Black Philadelphia. Prior to the Civil Rights Movement, African American students of dance were not allowed to join classical ballet classes in Philadelphia because of the color of their skin. Some students studied ballet through private lessons and only a handful of studios, mostly in New York City, would admit black students to special, all black classes. Cuyjet, however, with her fair-skinned complexion was able to enroll at the Philadelphia Ballet Company, which did not admit black students at that time, and studied there until her identity was revealed after a performance.White-Dixon, \\"Marion Cuyjet,\\" 24. While at the Dorsey school Cuyjet became close with another student, Sydney Gibson King, who shared the desire to sustain and develop the groundwork laid by Dorsey. Cuyjet, with King, opened the Sydney-Marion School of Dance in 1946 which led to the forming of their own schools shortly after. The Judimar School of Dance opened in 1948, named after her and her daughter Judy (born 1940), in Philadelphia's city center. Some of Judimar's former students include Judith Jamison, Arthur Hall, Joan Myers Brown, John Jones, Elmer Ball, Donna Lowe Warren, Delores Browne Abelson, Tamara Guillebeaux, and China White.

A single engined triplane, the Snark did not fly until after the end of the war, only three being built. Development and design In spring 1918, although the Sopwith Snipe had not yet entered service with the Royal Air Force, the British Air Ministry drew up a specification (RAF Type I) for its replacement. The specification asked for a fighter capable of operations at high altitude and powered by the ABC Dragonfly engine, which was an air-cooled radial engine which had been ordered in large numbers based on promises of high performance and ease of production. Sopwith produced two designs to meet this requirement, a biplane, the Snapper, and a triplane, the Snark. Sopwith received orders for three prototypes each of the Snapper and Snark,Bruce 1969, pp. 52, 56. as well as orders for 300 of a Dragonfly powered version of the Snipe, the Sopwith Dragon. The Snark had a wooden monocoque fuselage like that of the Sopwith Snail lightweight fighter, and had equal span single-bay wings with ailerons on each wing. The wings had unequal spacing and stagger, with the gap between the mid and upper wings less than that between the lower and mid wings to minimise the height of the aircraft.Bruce 1969, pp. 51‚Äì52. The Snark was fitted with what was, for the time, a very heavy armament for a single-seat fighter. In addition to the normal two synchronised Vickers guns inside the fuselage, it had four Lewis guns mounted under the lower wings, firing outside the propeller disc. These guns were inaccessible to the pilot, and so could not be reloaded or unjammed in flight.Bruce 1957, p.632. The first prototype was complete by October 1918, but flight-ready engines were not available until March 1919, and the Snark did not make its first flight until July 1919. While it demonstrated reasonable performance and good maneuverability, (although not as good as the earlier Sopwith Triplane), by this time, it had been realised that the Dragonfly engine had serious problems, being prone to overheating and severe vibration, and plans for production of the Snark had been abandoned.Bruce 1969, p.53. The three Snarks continued in use for trials purposes until 1921.Robertson 1970, p.229.

Use as boundary This location was used as a benchmark for delineating the Northern boundary of Massachusetts, which was frequently disputed between the Province of Massachusetts Bay and the Province of New Hampshire. The issue was finally resolved in 1740, when it was decreed that the boundary run along a curved line three miles from the river between the ocean and a point three miles north of Pawtucket Falls, where the river begins to turn north. From there a line was to be drawn due west.Franklin K. VanZandt, Boundaries of the United States and the Several States, USGS Bulletin 1212, 1966 Canal and Dam The existence of these falls as a barrier to travel along the river necessitated the construction of the Pawtucket Canal in the last decade of the 18th century. In the 1820s, the falls, the canal, and the hydropower they provided led to the choosing of this site as America's first planned factory town, Lowell. Over the next 30 years, hydropower from the falls exclusively ran Lowell's numerous textile factories via the city's canal system. To maximize the head the canals provided, increase volume, and regulate flow, a dam was begun at the top of the falls in the 1820s and was enlarged into the 1840s. The final structure, which exists in the same form today, is a stone dam topped with five foot wooden flash- boards, capable during much of the year of channeling the entire Merrimack into the canal system. The effect being the Pawtucket Falls are dry. When heavy flow tops the dam, the waterfall created, which is a fraction of the total loss in elevation of 32 feet, is referred to as the Pawtucket Falls.

(Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin) Wallerant Vaillant (30 May 1623 ‚Äì 28 August 1677) was a painter of the Dutch Golden Age and one of the first artists to use the mezzotint technique, which he probably helped to develop.  Biography  Wallerant Vaillant was born in Lille, the oldest of five brothers who all became successful painters. * Jacques (1625‚Äì1691) traveled to Italy where he joined the Bentvueghels in Rome with the nickname Leeuwrik, and settled later in Berlin. * Jan (1627‚Äì1668+) was an engraver considered to be a member of the school of FrankenthalJean Vaillant in the RKD and later became a merchant in Frankfurt. * Bernard (1632‚Äì1698) accompanied Wallerant on all of his travels, and settled later in Rotterdam, where he became deacon of the Wallonian Church. * Andreas (1655‚Äì1693), the youngest, became an engraver in Paris, and died in Berlin visiting his brother Jacques. It is said Wallerant was a student of Erasmus Quellinus II (1607‚Äì1678) in Antwerp. He moved with his parents in 1643 to Amsterdam. In 1647 he lived in Middelburg, but in 1649 he was back in Amsterdam. In 1658 he traveled with his brother to Frankfurt and Heidelberg. He helped invent the Mezzotint technique (schraapkunst, or zwartekunst) with Prince Rupert of the Rhine when he was his tutor performing experiments in etching techniques. In 1659 he went to Paris with Philibert de Gramont where he stayed five years. In 1664 he settled in Amsterdam and became the court painter of John William Friso, Prince of Orange. He died in Amsterdam. Vaillant is most remembered today for his mezzotints, rather than his paintings.Wallerant Vaillant at the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam, retrieved 1-sep-09  References  Sources * Vaillant biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Further reading * (see index, v.1; fig. 13, v.1).

The Capital District is an 11 county area, which consists of the counties of Albany, Schenectady, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schoharie, Warren, Washington, Columbia, Montgomery, Fulton, and Greene. New York experimented with different types of municipalities before settling upon the current format of towns and cities occupying all the land in a county. Districts were created for Albany and Tryon counties in 1772; all were transformed into towns (or divided into multiple towns) in 1788 when all of the state of New York was divided into towns. Two years before that, in 1786, all of what Washington County encompassed at that time was divided into townships with the same legal status, abilities, and responsibilities as districts with their status as towns confirmed in 1788. Some other forms of government in earlier years included land patents with some municipal rights and boroughs. The following timelines show the creation of the current towns from their predecessors stretching back to the earliest municipal entity over the area.

Stephens (1832 - April 24, 1888) was a 1st Sergeant and 1st and 2nd Lieutenant in the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, an American Civil War Union regiment, and a war correspondent to the New York Weekly Anglo-African. Early Life Stephens was born in 1832 in Philadelphia, where his family had moved from Virginia the previous year to escape the white violence which arose following Nat Turner‚Äôs rebellion. His father, William Stephens, worked as a bootblack, waiter, and laborer, and became a lay preacher in the First African Baptist Church, a strongly abolitionist congregation active in the Underground Railroad. Education George Stephens became quite well educated, likely in schools operated by the Quakers and the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. Career He worked as a cabinet maker, with stints also as an upholsterer and as a sailor.Donald Yacovone, editor, A Voice of Thunder. The Civil War Letters of George E. Stephens, University of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL, 1998, 392 pages. . . After the Civil War, he initially worked in conjunction with the Freedmen's Bureau at educating newly freed slaves in Virginia. For a time he worked in Philadelphia, and later moved to Brooklyn, New York, where he died in 1888. Community Activism Together with 15 other associates, in 1853 he founded a literary society and library named the Banneker Institute in honor of the African-American mathematician Benjamin Banneker. He also became active in the Underground rRailroad. During his time at sea during 1857-1858, Stephens was nearly enslaved in Charleston, South Carolina, building his hatred of slavery even higher than his earlier strong abolitionist views. Military Service Like a great many northern African-Americans, once the civil war broke out Stephens was outraged and frustrated by the Federal government‚Äôs initial unwillingness to allow them to fight against the South. Stephens signed on as the cook and personal servant of Benjamin C. Tilghman, an officer in the Army of the Potomac‚Äôs 26th Regiment. He began sending his war correspondence to the New York Weekly Anglo-African during his service with the 26th. After the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry ‚Äî the first regiment enlisting free Northern blacks ‚Äî began forming during March 1863, Stephens argued strongly for black support of the regiment, and recruited enlistees for several months, He himself reported for duty as a 1st Sergeant on April 30, 1863. He was in the heart of the assault on Fort Wagner in Charleston Harbor on July 18, 1863, being wounded and barely escaping capture. He fought through the war with the 54th Massachusetts, receiving field commissions as a 2nd Lieutenant and then as a 1st Lieutenant, mustering out of the army in August 1865.

Biography  James Henry Gooding was born into slavery on August 28, 1838, in North Carolina. At a very young age his freedom was purchased by a James M. Gooding, who may have been his father, and he was sent to New York City. On September 11, 1846, Gooding was enrolled as a student in the New York Colored Orphan's Asylum, a prominent school and boarding house run primarily by Quaker women. There he received a classical education and became a proficient and prolific writer, a talent which would serve him for the rest of his life. From 1850 to 1852 he was indentured out of the Asylum to work for an Albert Westlake. As he approached adulthood he made the decision to hide his past as a slave, and began telling people he was born free in Troy, New York. In 1856, at the age of 18, he took a job on board a whaling ship out of New Bedford, Massachusetts. Whaling was one of the few industries at that time in which an African-American man could find employment on equal footing with whites. He often composed poetry describing life at sea on whaling ships. During his voyages he made as much as $20 per month, a salary equivalent to an officer on board ship. He gave up whaling in the fall of 1862, when he settled down in New Bedford and married Ellen Allen in the Seaman's Bethel, a prominent church in the city. Six days before Gooding's marriage, President Abraham Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect January 1, 1863, and opened the door for the enlistment of African Americans into the Union armies. On February 10, 1863, the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry recruiting office in New Bedford opened, and on February 14, Gooding enlisted as a member of Company C. In September 1863, James Gooding wrote a letter to Abraham Lincoln. His letters talked about how he was tired of being paid only ten dollars a month compared to the thirteen dollars a month that white soldiers received, and far less than the twenty dollars he had earned on his last voyage at sea. He demanded equal pay for his work. He was well regarded, and promoted to corporal in December, 1863. He fought steadfastly with the regiment, in the midst of the assault on Fort Wagner in Charleston Harbor on July 18, 1863, and in the battle of Oustlee, Florida, on February 20, 1864. In the latter battle, his commander sent notification to the editors of the Mercury that he was killed in battle and his wife applied for a pension in April. He was, however, not dead. Wounded in the thigh, Gooding was taken to Andersonville in early March 1864, where he died as a prisoner of war on July 19, 1864. He is buried in grave 3,585 in the Andersonville National Cemetery. Unknown to him at the time of his death, Congress had passed the law in June 1864 granting equal pay to African American soldiers.

It featured cinematography by Wolf Koenig and a musical score by Eldon Rathburn, and was produced as part of the NFB's postwar Canada Carries On series.  Synopsis  With the aid of a trained dog, a cowboy (Wallace Jensen) in southwestern Alberta, has located and rounded up a large herd of wild horses. Driving the mustangs into a corral at the Cochrane Ranch, he begins the process of \\"breaking\\" each horse. The process is a familiar one for cowboys that requires years of experience and a knowledge of handling horses. Selecting one wild horse that is marked with a white streak on its face, the cowboy lassoes the horse and cinches the rope to a large stump, gradually pulling the animal closer to him. Once the wild horse gets used to his hands near the head, ears and neck, the cowboy ties a rope halter on its head. The next step is to introduce a loose halter, fitted without a bridle and bit and finally, a blanket and saddle on the half-broken steed. The cowboy mounts the rearing, high-spirited mustang, and driving through the open corral, rides rapidly at break-neck speed across the Alberta Rocky Mountain Foothills, until his mount is finally able to get used to his rider. The cowboy reins in the charging steed, slowing the gait to a trot, finally heading back to the ranch. Production Filmmaker Colin Low got the idea for the film after attending a cattle auction in 1952 with his father, who had worked as a foreman at the Cochrane Ranch, in what is now Cochrane, Alberta. The following summer, Low asked NFB colleague Wolf Koenig, an ex-farm boy, if he would like to come to Alberta to make a film about a cowboy. Koenig was in the NFB Animation Department, with film becoming his first live-action production using a new Arriflex cinema camera fitted with a gyro stabilizer. Corral has no narration, although Low had been initially worried that he would need extensive narration to explain the process of horse breaking. The film represents a break in tradition for the NFB, which had until that time, relied heavily on narration in its documentaries. Low had left the narration for colleague Stanley Jackson to write over the weekend. When Low and producer Daly arrived on Monday to see the finished film Jackson had said, \\"it's done.\\" However, when they gathered around the moviola to watch the film, the visual were accompanied only by Rathburn's musical score. \\"Where's the commentary?\\" someone reportedly asked. Jackson replied, \\"What would a commentary do for that?\\" The gentle guitar score and use of handheld camera also breaks with Hollywood's traditionally epic portal of the cowboy.Rist 2001, pp. 41‚Äì42. Corral was shot in 1953 at the Cochrane Ranch. Low's father provided the horses and his top hand, \\"Wally\\" Jensen. Low had written a script but Jensen re-wrote it as they filmed. Film producer Tom Daly edited the film with Eldon Rathburn writing the score for two jazz guitarists, based on well-known cowboy songs. Reception In April 1954, Corral would play theatrically across Canada and in some American cities, including Washington, D.C. Individual films in the Canada Carries On series were further distributed worldwide by the NFB and were also made available to film libraries operated by university and provincial authorities.Evans 2001, p. 63.

En route, the aircraft was refueled four times by KB-29M Superfortresses, near Lajes Air Base in the Azores, Dhahran Airfield in Saudi Arabia, Clark Air Base in the Philippines, and Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii, using the soon-to-be obsolete grappled-line looped-hose technique. The aircraft flew at altitudes between and completed the trip around the world at an average ground speed of . Lucky Lady II crew members are greeted by Air Secretary Stuart Symington and General Hoyt Vandenberg General Curtis LeMay, Strategic Air Command's commanding general, was on hand to greet Lucky Lady II upon its arrival, together with dignitaries including Secretary of the Air Force W. Stuart Symington, Air Force Chief of Staff General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, and Major General Roger M. Ramey, commanding general of the Eighth Air Force. LeMay said the mission showed that the Air Force could send bombers from the United States to \\"any place in the world that required the atomic bomb\\". He also said mid-air refueling could also be used for fighter aircraft. Symington noted that aerial refueling would \\"turn medium bombers into inter- continental bombers\\". The aircraft's crew were each awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and were honored by the National Aeronautic Association with its annual Mackay Trophy, recognizing the outstanding flight of the year and by the Air Force Association with its Air Age Trophy. Another B-50 named Global Queen had taken off on February 25 with the same mission, but was forced to land at Lajes Air Base in the Azores due to an engine fire. Altogether, five B-50As were lined up by LeMay for the task in anticipation that at least one would succeed, and only four weeks were given to prepare the crews and logistics. Other Lucky Ladys Lucky Lady II was the name of a B-17 of the 338th Bomb Squadron, which was shot down near Tielrode, Belgium, on 30 July 1943. Lucky Lady II was also one of three similarly named aircraft, each of which was part of a historic circumnavigation on behalf of the United States Air Force: Lucky Lady I crew members Lucky Lady I was one of three Boeing B-29 Superfortresses that attempted a round-the-world trip in July‚ÄìAugust 1948, flying from and back to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. One B-29 crashed in the Arabian Sea. Lucky Lady I, commanded by First Lieutenant A.M. Neal, together with Gas Gobbler, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel R.W. Kline, completed the flight in 15 days, after making eight stops along the way and flying for 103 hours and 50 minutes. Lucky Lady III was one of three Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses that made the circumnavigation in January 1957 as part of Operation Power Flite, flying from Castle Air Force Base in California and completing the flight in 45 hours and 19 minutes (at an average ground speed of ) with the assistance of aerial refueling from KC-97 Stratofreighters. Eight years after Lady II, Lady III made the trip around the world in under half the time required by Lucky Lady II.

Produced during the Great Depression, the film's theme was intensely socialist, covering the poor living conditions of the workers and coal miners of Belgium's industrialised Borinage region. It is considered a classic work of political cinemaPatricia Aufderheide, Documentary Film: a very short Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2007, p.79. and has been described as \\"one of the most important references in the documentary genre\\".Misery in Borinage Mis√®re au Borinage was shot in black and white and is a silent film. Its intertitles are in French and Dutch languages. It opens with a title card, bearing the slogan: \\"Crisis in the Capitalist World. Factories are closed down, abandoned. Millions of proletarians are hungry!\\" and shows footage of the repression of a 1933 strike in Ambridge, Pennsylvania in the United States. The film then shifts to the Borinage, an industrial region in Belgium's Province of Hainaut, during and after the general strike of 1932. The majority of the film focuses on the plight of Borinage coal miners who have been evicted from their houses and made unemployed following their participation in the strike. It also shows the poor living conditions of the miners and their families. The film makes the argument that strike action could be justified by the poor conditions in which Belgian workers lived. The film was made against the context of the Great Depression and premiered in Brussels in March 1934. According to Robert Stallaerts, Storck's work as director of Mis√®re au Borinage justified his status as \\"father of Walloon cinema\\" even though he was actually Flemish.Historical dictionary of Belgium Scarecrow press, 1999, p. 191.

Designed by Westland Aircraft it never entered service but played a useful role in the testing of the COW 37 mm gun. Only the two prototypes were completed. Development In 1924 the British Air Ministry issued specification 4/24 for a twin-engined home defence fighter, which would be employed to defend Britain against night attacks by enemy heavy bombers. The aircraft had to have a top speed of at least 125 mph (201 km/h) and a landing speed of not more than 50 mph (80 km/h). In September 1925 the Air Staff amended the specification to specify the use of the 37-mm COW gun and supercharged engines. From the design proposals submitted by the manufacturers, two types were selected for prototypes development, the Bristol Bagshot and the Westland Westbury.Meekcoms, K.J., and Morgan, E.B; The British Aircraft Specifications File. Air-Britain, UK, 1994. Two airframes were ordered from Westland, allotted serial numbers J7765 and J7766. The Westbury was a twin-engined three-bay biplane of conventional layout, large for its day irrespective of type and remarkably so for a fighter. The first prototype, J5565 was of all-wooden construction, while the second, J7766, had a mixed construction wing with a duralumin mainspar and wooden ribs. All surfaces were covered with fabric. The wings were of equal span, with three pairs of struts on each side and wire bracing. The fuselage was deep, of rectangular cross- section, and had a blunt nose. The crew of three had open cockpits in the nose (front gunner), in front of the wing (pilot) and aft of the wing (rear gunner). The landing gear was fixed. The Bristol Jupiter VI air-cooled radial engines were installed without cowls on nacelles that were attached on top of the lower wing, at the innermost pair of struts. Each drove a two-bladed propeller. The first aircraft J7765 was delivered to the A&AEE; at RAF Martlesham Heath in 1926 and 1927. J7766, delivered the following year, was distinguished by having engine nacelles that extended aft of the trailing edge of the wing, the wing with duralumin spars and a metal-covered wing centre section, and a more rounded nose shape.Mason, Tim. British Flight Testing Martlesham Heath 1920-1939. Putnam, UK, 1993 The modified nose and nacelle shapes were also introduced on the first prototype.Green, William, and Swanborough, Gordon. The Complete Book of Fighters. Greenwich Editions, UK 2004. Although the Westbury was judged to have good flying characteristics, and the competing Bristol Bagshot monoplane had serious structural problems, it was not put into production. It was clear that the performance of the Westbury was insufficient to make it a useful fighter aircraft. However, it did serve for several years as an armament trials platform, mostly for the 37 mm COW gun. Armament and trials The Westbury could be fitted with defensive Lewis guns on a Scarff ring position on top of the fuselage, aft of the COW gun mounting, and in a ventral mount. Its most important gun mountings were in the nose and immediately aft of the wing, and had special fittings for the much larger and heavier COW guns. The COW gun mounting in the nose was of Westland design, and allowed the gun to be trained over a wide arc. It supported the gun on the apex of a pyramidal structure, that was asymmetric to allow the gunner to have easy access to the weapon. This structure was fixed on a rotating base, which also provided the gunner with a rotating platform to stand on. The gunner could train the mount by turning a hand gear, or push on a pedal to engage a brake that locked the mount in its position. The elevation and depression of the gun were accomplished by the muscle power of the gunner. As the large ammunition clip of the COW gun prevented sighting over the barrel, a sight was installed to its left. The gun is reported to have been successfully fired in the air, also when trained to the side.King, H.F. Armament of British Aircraft 1909-1939. Military Book Society, UK, 1971.Clarke, Wallace R. British Aircraft Armament Volume 2: RAF guns and gunsights from 1914 to the present day. Patrick Stephens, UK, 1994. The rear COW gun mounting was installed immediately aft of the wing, in a fixed mount that only allowed for a limited adjustment of the angle. A special sight for this gun was installed in the pilot's cockpit. This armament would be aimed by the pilot from a position below the aircraft attacked, in the manner of the Schr√§ge Musik installation used by the Germans during WWII. However, the concept was based on the theory of no allowance sighting, which sought to install the gun at an angle at which the body lift of the projectile, due to the forward motion of the aircraft, would compensate for the effect of gravity, straightening the trajectory.Sinnott, Colin. The Royal Air Force and Aircraft Design 1923-1939. Frank Cass, UK, 2001. The first firing trials resulted in several broken wing ribs, and a special rubber-spring shield was developed to protect the upper wing. Over the period of gunnery trials continued between 1927 and 1930, thirteen reports of structural damage were filed, indicating that there remained problems with absorbing the blast and recoil of the guns. The Westbury was also used to test an Oerlikon cannon in the aft position, at angles adjustable between 40 and 60 degrees, but this gun was found to have inadequate serviceability.

Although the minimum age for service in the Union army was 18, in 1861 ‚Äî at age 16 ‚Äî Emilio gave his age as 18 and enlisted in Company F of the 23rd Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. He was noticeably brave and steadfast, and by September, 1862 he had been promoted to the rank of Sergeant.Captain Luis F. Emilio, A Brave Black Regiment.

Reprint (with a new introduction) of the second enlarged edition, originally published in 1894, Boston. First edition published 1891. Emilio was among the group of original officers of the 54th selected by Massachusetts War Governor John Albion Andrew. He mustered in as a 2nd Lieutenant on March 30, 1863. Two weeks later, he was promoted to 1st Lieutenant, and on May 27, he was made Captain of Company E. Captain Emilio emerged from the ferocious assault on Fort Wagner on July 18, 1863 as the regiment's acting commander, since all of the other ranking officers had been killed or wounded. In his report regarding the assault on Fort Wagner, Brig. General T. Seymour, commander of the United States forces wrote from Morris Island, South Carolina on November 7, 1863: \\"Upon leaving the ditch for the parapet, they obstinately contested with the bayonet our advance. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the men succeeded in driving the enemy from most of their guns, many following the enemy into the fort. It was here upon the crest of the parapet that Colonel Shaw fell; here fell Captains Russell and Simpkins; here were also most of the officers wounded. The colors of the regiment reached the crest, and were fought for by the enemy; the State flag there torn form its staff, but the staff remains with us. Hand grenades were now added to the missiles directed against the men. The fight raged here for about an hour, when compelled to abandon the fort, the men formed a line about seven hundred yards from the fort, under the command of Capt. Luis F. Emilio, ‚Äî the ninth captain in the line; other captains were either killed or wounded. The regiment then held the front until relieved by the Tenth Connecticut at about two o'clock A.M. of the 19th\\". Captain Emilio fought with the 54th for over three years of dangerous combat, including the Battle of Olustee in Florida, mustering out of the Union army on March 29, 1865, still not yet 21 years old. Following the war, he went into the real estate business, first in San Francisco, and later in New York.

It is the oldest surviving church inside Yerevan's city limits. History The church was built in the late 6th century, between the years 591 and 602. The construction began soon after the conclusion of long Byzantine-Sasanian War (572-591), that resulted in expansion of direct Byzantine rule over all western regions of Armenia, as far as Avan. In order to strengthen political control over newly conquered regions, emperor Maurice (582-602) decided to support pro-Chalcedonian fraction of the Armenian Church. In 593, regional council of western Armenian bishops was convened in Theodosiopolis, and proclaimed allegiance to the Chalcedonian Definition. The council elected John (Yovhannes, or Hovhannes) of Bagaran, as new Catholicos of Chalcedonian Armenians. Since the headquarters of his rival, the pro-Persian Catholicos Moses II (574‚Äì604) was located in Dvin, newly elected pro-Byzantine Catholicos John decided to place his headquarters in Byzantine controlled Avan. New complex in Avan included the cathedral church and several other buildings. Adjacent to the church on the north side are the foundations of the palatial residence of Catholicos, thought to have been constructed before the church around the years 581-582. According to the 7th-century Armenian historian Sebeos, both structures were built under the Catholicos' supervision. The church is believed to have been dedicated to the Apostles. In the year 602 the Persian King Khosrov II seized Avan, and having eliminated the Avanian Catholicos, transformed the complex into a monastery. Architecture Katoghike Church which would later be renamed Surp Hovhannes, was constructed upon what was the site of previous structures. Numerous ornamented stones found during excavations predominantly on the western side of the building confirm this notion. The remains of the structure sit on a two-stepped platform, while the church's vaults, domes, and roof are missing as well as portions of the upper walls. Architectural historian Toros Toramanian believed that the current roofless church once had five domes; a single larger dome in the center and four smaller cupolas over each corner of the church, above the circular corner chambers. If correct, Avan would be the first such example of a church with five cupolas. The church is quatrefoil in plan, with an octagonal central bay originally with a dome above. There are four semi-circular apses, and four three-quarter circle diagonal niches leading to circular chambers in the corners of the church. The circular shape of the side-chapels gives the church its unique design. The front (west) fa√ßade has lengthy inscriptions on either side of the entry upon the top third of the building, and also on the lintel above the front door there is a short inscription. The name 'Yohan' can be found written within one of the inscriptions, possibly as an earlier style of the name of Hovhannes, but thought not to be of any reference to the Catholicos. A low arched doorway leads into the church from the western wall and is surrounded by an ornamented casing, three-quartered pillars, topped with capitals and lunettes. A vishap stone was used in the interior as the lintel above the main portal. At the north wall is another doorway thought to have been constructed at a later time, after the church was built, to lead to the palace of the Catholicos. Aside from the reasons previously mentioned, the church of S. Hovhannes is important architecturally because it is thought to have been a prototype of Saint Hripsime Church completed later in the year 618. Conservation work was done to the church in 1940-1941, and again in 1956-1966, and 1968.

It was founded in 1998 and is based in Clearwater, Florida. PODS is owned by the Ontario Teachers‚Äô Pension Plan.  History  PODS was founded in 1998 by Peter Warhurst who was looking to expand his family's storage business. He invented PODS containers, as well as a hydraulic lift system that enables operators to easily deliver and transport the units, which he named PODZILLA. In 2003, PODS received an equity investment of $15M from the Hunt Private Equity Group, along with a $25M senior credit facility from Congress Financial Corp. In 2005, PODS grossed over $200 million in revenue, and was still privately owned. By then, the company was franchised in 45 states, and logged 2,500 pickups and deliveries a day. Between 2005 and August 2009, PODS service expanded to include 48 states, as well as Australia and Canada. left In February 2007, PODS was acquired by Bahrain-based investment firm Arcapita for $451.4 million. In August 2009, PODS and moving services holding company UniGroup reached an agreement to share services. Under the agreement, PODS would have access to the packing and loading services of UniGroup's United Van Lines and Mayflower Transit businesses, while UniGroup could access 138,000 PODS moving and storage containers. In June 2010, PODS announced the sale of the first franchise in the United Kingdom. In 2012, PODS sued fellow transportation carrier U-Haul International in U.S. District Court for trademark infringement, claiming that U-Haul \\"improperly and unlawfully\\" used the word \\"pods\\" to describe its U-Box product. On September 25, 2014, a jury ruled that U-Haul had infringed on PODS' trademarks, causing confusion and damaging business for PODS. The jury found that U-Haul unjustly profited from mentioning the term on its marketing and advertising materials and started using the word only after PODS became famous as a brand name in the moving and storage industry. The jury awarded PODS $62 million in damages. In February 2015, Arcapita finalized the sale of PODS for more than $1B to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.  Business model  PODS container at sporting event. PODS operates by delivering a storage container to its customers' location, which the customer packs themselves. The units can then be stored at a warehouse or delivered to another location. The units and warehouse are owned by local franchisees. As of 2007, PODS was working with telecommunications carrier Sprint Nextel to use wireless GPS to track trucks in the fleet and to give directions for deliveries.

During the Second World War Ring played a leading role in the theatre conflict which emerged in 1941, being on the board of the Norwegian Actors' Equity Association. One of the disagreements was whether the actors were obliged to participate in radio productions. After several actors, including Ring, refused to participate for Radioteatret in May 1941, the Gestapo intervened, and the group had their working permissions revoked. This was 21 May, and already the same evening a strike was effective in Oslo, and from the next day also in Bergen and Trondheim.

The ministers of foreign affairs of France, Germany, Iran, the United Kingdom and the United States as well as Chinese and Russian diplomats and the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs announcing an Iran nuclear deal framework in Lausanne on 2 April 2015. The framework deal became the basis for a final agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which was agreed on 15 July 2015. The P5+1 refers to the UN Security Council's five permanent members (the P5); namely China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States; plus Germany. The P5+1 is often referred to as the E3+3 by European countries. It is a group of six world powers which, in 2006, joined together in diplomatic efforts with Iran with regard to its nuclear program. History In June 2006, China, Russia, and the United States joined the three EU-3 countries, which had been negotiating with Iran since 2003, to offer another proposal for comprehensive negotiations with Iran. Up to then, the UN Security Council has adopted six resolutions in response to the Iranian nuclear program. The first resolution, #1696, was adopted in July 2006 and demands that Iran halt its uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. The next three years saw the adoption of three more resolutions, #1737 in December 2006, #1747 in March 2007, and #1803 in March 2008, which have imposed gradual sanctions on Iranian individuals and entities believed to be involved in Iran's nuclear and missile programs. UN Security Council Resolution #1835, adopted in September 2008, restated the Security Council's demands made in resolution #1696 of 2006, but without imposing additional sanctions. The last Security Council resolution, #1929, adopted in June 2010, saw the expansion of more sanctions on Iran for its lack of cooperation and its continued uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities Role of Germany Germany is the key trading partner of Iran. Iran's nuclear program depends mainly upon German products and services. For example, the thousands of centrifuges used to enrich the uranium are controlled by multi-purpose automation hardware and software (\\"Simatic WinCC Step7\\") by Siemens. Around 50 German firms have branch offices in Iran, and more than 12,000 firms have trade representatives in Iran. Many well-known German companies are involved in major Iranian infrastructure projects, especially in the petrochemical sector, like Linde, BASF, Lurgi, Krupp, Siemens, ZF Friedrichshafen, Mercedes, Volkswagen and MAN. (2008). In 2005, Germany had the largest share of Iran's export market with $5.67 billion (14.4%). In 2008, German exports to Iran increased by 8.9 percent and comprised 84.7 percent of the total German‚ÄìIranian trade volume. The overall bilateral trade volume until the end of September 2008 stood at 3.23 billion euros, compared to 2.98 billion euros the previous year. The value of trade between Germany and Iran increased from around 4.3 billion euro in 2009 to nearly 4.7 billion euro in 2010. The Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce has estimated that economic sanctions against Iran may cost more than 10,000 German jobs and have a negative impact on the economic growth of Germany. Sanctions would especially hurt medium-sized German companies, which depend heavily on trade with Iran. There has been a shift in German business ties with Iran from long-term business to short-term and from large to mid-sized companies which have fewer business interests in the US and thus are less prone to U.S. political pressure. 2013 interim agreement A round of the talks between Iran and the P5+1, chaired by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton, was held in the Kazakh city of Almaty on 26‚Äì27 February 2013. The two sides agreed to meet again in the city on 5‚Äì6 April to continue the talks after holding expert-level talks in the Turkish city of Istanbul on 17‚Äì18 March 2013. In a further meeting of the P5+1 in Geneva on 16 October 2013, Iran stated that it may allow unannounced visits to its nuclear sites as a \\"last step\\" in a proposal to resolve differences with the West. Lowering uranium enrichment levels could also be part of a final deal, according to an Iranian official. On 24 November 2013, an interim agreement was reached between the E3/EU+3 (P5+1 countries and the EU) and Iran in Geneva, Switzerland. It is expected to lead to a six-month freeze and partial rollback of portions of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for decreased economic sanctions on Iran, as the countries work towards a long- term agreement. It represents the first formal agreement between the United States and Iran in 34 years. 2014 negotiations on a comprehensive agreement U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs and the lead negotiator with Iran, Wendy Sherman, told a Senate hearing that Iran's ballistic missile program would be addressed as part of a comprehensive nuclear deal.

In the 1990s, the group was often the subject of strong criticisms in the media, as former members and a 1995 report established by the Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France presented it as a cult. In 1997, the founder and several followers were sentenced to prison on grounds of duty to rescue, complicity in forgery and unauthorized practice of medicine. However, the group considered to be a victim of defamation and expressed its complaints particularly through its lawyer. History and doctrines The movement was founded in 1989 by Marie-Th√©r√®se Castano (born 1945), who was widely called Ma√Øt√©. She is a former trader and real estate broker who achieved some notability in the 1980s hosting a radio program about esotericism and occultism. Later, she organized conferences in which she talked about pacifism, ecology, alternative medicine, personal development, and astrology. With people who shared her opinions, she decided to found a community in La Coucourde, Dr√¥me, which gathered approximately 100 people and some children. Created in 1992, this 40-hectare ecological farm lived in autarky. Members produced their own fruits, vegetables, cheeses, milk and raised livestock, then sold them on the market. Affirming to be in relation with higher entities, Castano said to be the reincarnation of Nefertiti. The doctrine of the group, mainly related to ecology and New Age, focused on meditation, study of Egyptian civilization, cosmic energies, astrology and telepathy. The group claimed to be able to get giant fruits and vegetables without fertilizers. Some members refused vaccinations for their children. The community's purpose was the scientific research in parapsychology and the knowledge of the laws of the nature. In 1997, Castano publicly announced the break-up of the community. Reception The media criticized the group mainly on allegations of despoilment, paranoia, loss of critical thought, family breakdown, abandonment of medical treatments, refusal of vaccinations and school attendance for children. The group was also criticized for its challenge of the basic concepts of scientific medicine and false certificates of vaccination. The doctrine was sometimes considered as a potential source of nervous breakdown and attempted suicide. In France, the group was eventually classified as a cult in the 1995 parliamentary report. In 1997, the Belgian parliamentary commission established a list of 189 movements containing the Horus community. After the death of two women of 82 and 54 years old respectively in July 1994 and in January 1995, Castano was indicted and jailed on 20 June 1997 for duty to rescue and illegal practice of medicine (the two dead bodies were transported to their villages where deaths were reported, then the bodies cremated). In 1998, a couple was indicted after refusing medical care for their young child, and a doctor was expelled from the General Medical Council for having issued a false certificate of vaccination. On 30 March 1999, the Tribunal correctionnel de Valence, as well as on 7 July 1999, the Court d'Appel de Grenoble, sentenced Castano and several followers to fines and prison. Responses to criticisms These accusations were rejected by the group. After a highly critical documentary broadcast on France 2 on 4 January 1996 in Envoy√© sp√©cial, members stated that the journalist had belonged to the community for two years, then accepted to produce a such documentary for 600,000 francs because of financial difficulties.Jo√´l Labruy√®re, La sectophobie, 2001, Les 3 Monts editions, pp. 32-36 ()Jo√´l Labruy√®re, L'√âtat inquisiteur ‚Äî La spiritualit√© en danger!, 2000, Les 3 Monts editions, pp. 219-21 () Members considered they were victims of conspiracy to disclose their discoveries in agriculture, which would justify their alleged persecution, including arsons and animals killed.Jo√´l Labruy√®re, L'√âtat inquisiteur ‚Äî La spiritualit√© en danger!, 2000, Les 3 Monts editions, pp. 69 () For example, in 1996, a teacher follower was revoked by the Minist√®re de l'√âducation Nationale for fear of proselytism, but in 1998 the Tribunal Administratif de Grenoble nullified this decision. After complaints by the √âducation Nationale on the grounds of inadequate education, children were subject of a special watch by the judge of Valencia, which was perceived as offensive by community's members. For her part, Castano said she did not practice medicine and did not create a school within the community. In his 1999 book entitled Les radis de la col√®re - Le complot d√©masqu√©, pourquoi la France a-t-elle peur d'Horus?, Horus' lawyer Jean-Pierre Joseph, rejected these accusations. Although he was just the lawyer of several members of the group, Christian Paturel also denied these criticisms and presented the group as an \\"agrarian community\\".

History The Department, as the Department of Commerce, was formed in 1965 by Section 225 of the Executive Organization Act of 1965, 1965 PA 380, MCL 16.325. The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulation was abolished with most responsibilities transferred to the newly- formed Department. It was renamed the Department of Consumer and Industry Services under an executive order issued in 1996 by Governor John Engler, merging most of the Department of Labor within the Department of Commerce.Executive Order 1996-2, MCL 445.2001 Engler also transferred some responsibilities of the former Commerce Department to the Michigan Jobs Commission. Governor Engler created the Office of Financial and Insurance Regulation as a Type I agency within the department in 2000. The Corporations, Securities and Land Development Bureau's security functions and all functions of the Insurance Bureau and Financial Institutions Bureau were transferred to the office.Executive Order 2000-2. In 2003, Governor Granholm issued an executive order renaming the Department to the \\"Department of Labor and Economic Growth.\\" A few boards were transferred from the Family Independence Agency, and some functions of the Fire Marshal Division of the Department of State Police were transferred to its Bureau of Construction Codes and Fire Safety. With that same Executive order, the Brownfield Redevelopment Single Business Tax Credits and a merged Metropolitan Extension Telecommunications Rights-of-Way Oversight Authority and Michigan Broadband Development Authority were moved from the Department of Treasury to the Department. From the Department of Management and Budget, Michigan Next Energy Authority, Michigan Strategic Fund were transferred. The Department of Career Development was also merged with the Department under this executive order. In 2008, Governor Granholm moved various energy-related programs from the Michigan Department of Agriculture and elsewhere to the Department and renamed the Department to \\"Michigan Department of Energy, Labor & Economic Growth\\" (DELEG). The various programs transferred were the \\"No Worker Left Behind\\" green jobs training initiatives, Michigan's new energy efficiency building code, the Public Service Commission and energy efficiency programs, the Office of Sustainability, the Renewable Fuels Commission, and the State Energy Office. In April 2011, Governor Snyder renamed the Department to the \\"Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs\\" (LARA), transferring the Michigan Next Energy Authority, Michigan State Housing Development Authority, Bureau of Workforce Transformation, the Council for Labor and Economic Growth, and Land Bank Fast Track Authority to the Michigan Strategic Fund. Agencies transferred to the LARA from the Michigan Department of Community Health were the Bureau of Health Professions, Bureau of Health Systems, and the Controlled Substances Advisory Commission. Transferred from the LARA to the Michigan Department of Civil Rights were the Disability Concerns Commission, Division on Deaf and Hard of Hearing, Pacific American Affairs Commission, and Hispanic/Latino Commission. The independent Michigan Administrative Hearing System was also created within the Department under the reorganization plan. On March 18, 2015, Snyder signed an executive order to form the Michigan Agency for Energy with in LARA in 60 days. On January 17, 2013, Governor Snyder ordered that the Office of Financial and Insurance Regulation be transferred out of the Department to form a new Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services effective March 19, 2013. On December 6, 2018, the department formed the Bureau of Marijuana Regulation concurrent with the legalization of recreational marijuana to handle both types of possession. On February 4, 2019, Governor Gretchen Whitmer ordered that the Michigan Agency for Energy be transferred out of the department and into the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy as the Office of Climate and Energy.

The tunnels resulted from 2,000 years of quarrying beer stone, which was particularly favoured for cathedral and church features such as door and window surrounds because of its colour and workability for carving. Stone from the quarry was used in the construction of several of southern England's ancient cathedrals and a number of other important buildings as well as for many town and village churches, and for some buildings in the United States. Extraction was particularly intense during the Middle Ages, but continued until the 1920s. An adit to another set of workings can be seen from the South West Coast Path east of Branscombe, having been exposed by a landslip in the late 18th century. The quarry is part of the Jurassic Coast, and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Beer stone Beer stone is a creamy- grey, fine-textured limestone from the Middle Cretaceous period that takes its name from the town of Beer, where it was quarried and mined from Roman times. The layer of the best stone (lowest number of flints) is about thirty feet thick. It is also found in other places in south-west England. Because of its fine grain, it is a \\"Free stone\\", which means that it can be sawed or squared up in any direction: the crystal structure does not restrict the directions in which it can be worked. When first mined, it is relatively soft and easily cut, but it hardens with exposure to the air, and becomes about as hard as Portland stone. Roman period Cliffs east of Branscombe, Devon, showing an adit to Beer Stone workings The earliest workings at the quarry were in the Roman period initially in open quarries, after which it was necessary to quarry into the side of the hill because of other rock strata above. At this time the estuary of the River Axe provided a safe harbour for the removal of the stone by boat. The Roman section is typified by large arches which support the roof and was hand excavated using picks and wooden wedges. Beer stone was used in the Roman villa of Honeyditches, Seaton. Norman period The Norman workings join directly onto the earlier Roman quarry, working deeper into the hillside, and are typified by large rectangular columns which support the roof and includes several smaller side galleries. Medieval period Quarry men worked long hours by candlelight with hand tools such as picks and saws. The quarrymen were also often supported by child labour. Skilled stonemasons would then work on the stone in the caves because it became harder to carve when exposed to the air. The stone blocks would then be lifted by hand-operated cranes after the connection of Lewis lifting devices to be loaded onto horse- drawn wagons. They would then usually be taken to barges which would sail from Beer Beach.\\"Out of the darkness\\" brief history and description of the old quarry by Scott and Gray. After 1540, stone was only quarried for secular building. Modern period After the Reformation, one of the uses of the caves was as a secret Catholic church. In the 19th century, the caves were also used to store contraband, including by the smuggler Jack Rattenbury. Entrance to the caves Quarrying at the site ceased in the early 20th century when a new quarry was opened nearby. Some caves were then used to cultivate mushrooms and others were used to dump waste from the new quarry. Guided tours of the caves are now run from spring to autumn. The caves provide a haven for hibernating bats in winter. The presence of the bats, along with the opportunities to see the geological profiles that quarry faces allow, caused the old and new quarries to be declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The very rare Bechstein's bat and the greater and lesser horseshoe bats along with five other bat species are all found in the caves.

Influenced by or possibly lifted from the Peckham Constitutions of 1281,Pfander (1936) p.246 they are divided into three volumes written between 1320 and 1323,Broadview (2009) p.636 the book sought to be a comprehensive manual for parish priests (many of whom were poorly educated), and covered the confessional, sacramental theology and preaching. Described as \\"deep, all- encompassing and quite encyclopaedic\\",Rubin (1992) p.89 sections of the book were in use up to the late Middle Ages, and approximately fifty copies are known still to exist in various libraries. Contents and impact The title Oculus Sacerdotis translates as \\"priest's eye\\",Baker (1989) p.10 and refers to a theory put about in the book Oculus Moralis by Petrus Lacepiera that the different eyes on a human saw and represented different things ‚Äì the right eye was the eye of morals and actions, the left of knowledge.Boyle (1955) p.83 The idea of a \\"priest's eye\\", therefore, is that the book should show the things that a priest needed to know. The titles of the three volumes were linked to this ‚Äì the pars oculi dealing with the confessional, the dextera pars oculi, a manual of practical preaching and the sinistra pars oculi, a set of theological questions and answers. The volumes were written in reverse order, with sinistra pars oculi appearing first in 1320 and the pars oculi appearing in around 1326. Since the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215, much effort was made to educate the clergy so that they could better help others understand and live essential Christian beliefs and practices.Boyle (1955) p.81 In Oculus Sacerdotis, William of Pagula wrote: > \\"For parish priests to rule well in this regard they should be discerning, > knowing how to bind and loose sins, lest, out of ignorance, the blind take > it upon themselves to lead others and they both fall into the pit. Hence the > verse: 'If a blind man guide a blind man ‚Ä¶ [Matt. 15:14].' First the leader > falls into the pit and then the follower.\\"Saul (2006) p.96 The book was initially considered to be repetitive and badly ordered,Boyle (1955) p.84 but more modern research has suggested that the books were meant to be repetitive, with each volume dealing with the same problem in a slightly different way. The dextera pars oculi was used as a handbook until the 16th century,Rubin (1992) p.90 and a revision of it is said to have been produced by John de Burgh in 1384 as the Pupilla oculi (pupil of the eye), though it is known to have been in existence as early as 1368.Watkin pp.93‚Äì4 The book is considered to have influenced almost all similar texts written within the next sixty years, but its lengthy prose meant that many of the parish priests it was meant to have helped could not actually read it.Hughes (1988) p.147 At least fifty copies are still known to exist in various libraries, despite the age of the book. Summary of Instructions In 1385, a selection of twenty- one of the full book's instructions were issued. These instructions, summarized here from the Broadview translation, and many of which reflect current Catholic practices, provide insight into the religious and spiritual values of 14th-century English Christianity: 1\\\\. On the baptism of children. Although priests should be the ones to baptize infants, parents (father or mother) may perform the rite in an emergency. Should parents find themselves in such an emergency, they should say \\"I crysten thee in the name of the fadyr and the sone and the holy ghost\\" as they sprinkle water over the child. They may also immerse the child three times in water (only water, no other liquids). Although priests require celibacy, marriage relations are not restricted by the performance of this emergency ceremony, although if someone else is present and willing to perform the baptism that is preferred. The baptismal words should not under any circumstances be repeated over the child, not even later by a priest, but the child should be taken to a church soon afterward for exorcism, anointing, and other customary actions that were not performed at home. Godparents should speedily have their godchildren confirmed by a bishop, and should teach them the Lord's Prayer and the Creed; chastity, justice, and charity, as they grow up. 2\\\\. On the confirmation of children. Confirmation of a child should happen no later than the first five years of life. 3\\\\. On the physical care of children. Beware, parents, not to sleep in the same bed as infants, as the possibility of rolling over and smothering them would be considered homicide by law. Also dangerous is binding infants in swaddling clothes and leaving them alone unattended. 4\\\\. On prohibited marriage. Because of a spiritual kinship between children and their godparents and parents (as well as sponsors at confirmation), no marriage between any of these parties is allowed. 5\\\\. On marriage engagements and secret marriages. The verbal consent between a man and a woman to marry, even if not betrothed, is enough to make their marriage binding. Such a contract should be done in the presence of a priest and legitimate witnesses. Even if the verbal contract is broken by one party marrying someone else, the original marriage contract is the true contract, even if the second marriage was consummated and the first was not. Clerics, priests, or others present at secret marriages are to be suspended from office for three years. 6\\\\. On the sharing of beds between the opposite sex. No male or female older than seven years old should lie in the same bed, even siblings, to guard against fornication and incest. 7\\\\. On confession. Beginning at age 14, the faithful should confess sins to their own parish at least once a year, and receive the Body of christ during Eastertide (unless the priest counsels to abstain). With permission from one's own priest, one may confess to another suitable priest for a good reason, but otherwise, the rejection of this instruction results in banishment from entering any churches as well as banishment from a Christian burial upon death. 8\\\\. On the confession of pregnant women. Because it would be improper for a priest to hear confession during labor, pregnant women should take care of their confessions beforehand to prepare for the possible reception of the Eucharist in case life-threatening circumstances arise during labor. 9\\\\. On behavior during Mass. For all parishonors who comfortably are able, kneeling is appropriate during Mass, while saying the words, \\"Hail salvation of the world, Word of the Father, true sacrifice, living flesh, fully God, truly man\\" or \\"Glory to you who is born\\" or the Lord's prayer or other prayers. This should also be done when they see the Body of Christ. 10\\\\. On tithes. All goods legitimately acquired should be tithed. Four rewards are promised to the tithe-payers: 1) abundance of crops; 2) physical health; 3) remission of sins; 4) reward in the kingdom of heaven. Four punishments are reserved for those unfaithful in tithing: 1) because they transgress God's law, they are cursed by God; 2) they are forced to tithe; 3) God does not ward off locusts or plagues, nor does he bring but little rain to those who do not tithe well; 4) taxes are required of those who do not tithe well. 11\\\\. On feasts and fasts. To be announced by the priest which specific days should be feasts and which should be fasts. 12\\\\. On magic and sorcery. Such things are utterly unlawful, as they are ineffective to cure man or beast. Punishment for clerics who participate in these things is degrading and lay people who participate shall be excommunicated. 13\\\\. On collecting interests on loans. No usury (interest) should be imposed on the payback of money, grain, wine, oil, or anything else that is loaned, as it is expressly forbidden in the Old and the New Testaments. Punishment for clerics is suspension from office, and excommunication for lay people until restitution is made. 14\\\\. On hiking prices. Venders should not sell their goods to travelers (or others) at a higher price than can be found at market. Similarly, faithful merchants should not wait to sell their goods at a higher price. If they do, they must repay all that was gained by doing so. 15\\\\. [Translation unclear.] 16\\\\. On the tonsuring of the clergy. All clergy are required to be tonsured (the crown of their heads shaved), and this is to be announced three times yearly. 17\\\\. On Lent. During Lent, the priest should publicly preach the Creed. 18\\\\. On proper behavior in church. Parishioners should be reminded by the priest to enter church humbly, reverently, peacefully, and worshipfully, and continue to behave thus while in church. Upon hearing the sacred Name of Jesus, they should react by internally or externally genuflecting; bowing their heads; or beating their breast. 19\\\\. On church grounds. Disagreements, disturbances, or discussions should not take place in churches or graveyards, neither should fights or profane conversations, as all these things can interrupt the divine servies or remove from the holiness. Also banned: conducting business; courts or judgments; dishonorable dances; improper songs; or any other dishonorable action. 20\\\\. On spousal communication. Oaths to celibacy (chastity) should not be taken without the consent of one's spouse, along with oaths to fast, or to go on pilgrimage (except to the Holy Land). Spouses are to be equal in these matters. 21\\\\. On harboring thieves. No one should keep at home or defend anyone known to have committed a robbery.Broadview (2009) p.636-9 References External links * An original Oculus Sacerdotis manuscript in Latin (University of Pennsylvania) Bibliography     * Category:14th-century Latin books ","title":"Oculus Sacerdotis"},{"id":"24192395","text":"Krikor Beledian (, born Beirut, 1945) is a prolific Armenian poet, novelist, and literary critic living in France.

Pagula was made the perpetual vicar of the church at Winkfield on 5 March 1314, although he was absent from his parish for several years while pursuing a doctorate in Canon Law from the University of Oxford. After this was granted (probably around 1320) he returned to work with his parish, and his writings are written from the perspective of someone familiar with the job of a rural priest. As well as the Oculus Sacerdotis, Pagula also wrote the Summa Summarum, a manual of canon law, and the Summa Praelatorum, a \\"source book\\" for local parish priests. He has also been linked to two speculua principum addressed to Edward III, which defend the right of royal subjects to refuse purveyance. His writings, particularly the Oculus Sacerdotis, were well received, and the Oculus has been described as the best and most influential of early modern ecclesiastical manuals. Life Pagula was probably born near Paull in Yorkshire, and after being confirmed as the parish priest of Winkfield on 5 March 1314 he was ordained on 1 June by Walter Reynolds at Canterbury Cathedral. On 8 March 1322 he was made penitentiary for the deanery surrounding Reading, and in 1323 a canon of Old St Paul's Cathedral. He died some time in 1332. Writings His books were all written in the 1320s after his appointment as a Doctor of Canon Law.Baker (1989) p.8 The first was the Summa Summarum, a 350,000-word manual of canon law and theology in five books, written between 1319 and 1322. The first book deals with sources of authority such as judges, the second with legal procedure, the third with the clergy, the fourth with marriage and the fifth with criminal offences. (This order is typical of collections of papal decretals, especially the Liber extra of Pope Gregory IX.) William's anonymously published manual was a compilation and distillation of the works of other writers, particularly Guillaume Durand. Its scope was greater than Durand's works ‚Äì it gave answers, not just questions, and took into account Magna Carta and English provincial differences that Durand (as a French writer) would not have included.Baker (1989) p.9 The book was circulated widely, and although it is over 650 years old, at least thirteen copies are known to have survived. The Oculus Sacerdotis was a manual for priests, and probably Pagula's most famous work.Boyle (1955) p.83 The book is divided into three volumes and covers practices in the confessional, sacramental theology and preaching. William drew extensively on the florilegium Manipulus florum by Thomas of Ireland.Clarke (2004), \\"Hibernicus, Thomas (c.1270‚Äìc.1340)\\", ODNB. The volumes were completed by 1326 and have been described as \\"deep, all-encompassing and quite encyclopedic\\".Rubin (1992) p.89 The book was edited and republished in 1368 by John de Burgh as the Pupilla oculi, and the section of the book dealing with the confessional was in use until the late Middle Ages.Rubin (1992) p.90 References Bibliography   * Cary J.

S. Patriarca in the Patriarca crime family. He was convicted of racketeering in 1986 and was in jail until being released in 2007. One of the Angiulo Brothers, Angiulo was \\"probably the last very significant Mafia boss in Boston‚Äôs history\\". Early life Gennaro J. Angiulo was born in 1919 to Italian immigrants Cesare and Giovannina \\"Jeannie\\" (n√©e Fimiani) Angiulo, who owned a mom-and-pop grocery store. He grew up with his siblings Nicolo, Donato, Francesco, Antonio, Michele and James. Even though he was from the North End neighborhood, he graduated from Boston English High School in 1936, where his ambition was to attend Suffolk Law School and become a criminal lawyer.Lehr and O'Neill, Black mass, p. 113 Gennaro Angiulo enlisted in the U.S. Navy at the beginning of World War II and served 4 years in the Pacific theater; he achieved the rank of Chief Boatswain's Mate. Upon completion of his service, he moved back to the North End of Boston. He had a regular table in the back room of an Italian dinery called Francesca's Restaurant on North Washington Street in North End, Boston. Mob career The Angiulo brothers who had only minor previous involvement in crime realized that as a result of convictions of previous operators there was an opening for numbers game operation. They offered small business people such as barbers and convenience store owners the opportunity to get a wholesale discount on bets on individual numbers. The Angiulo brothers were able to build a network converting these businesses into points of sale and bookies. This succeeded attracting the interest of the Mafia and the Angiulo brothers offered the Patriarca family a cut rather than resist them. The Angiulo brothers, who owned nightclubs, were publicly named as members of Cosa Nostra, more commonly known as the American Mafia. In 1963, Gennaro's reputation for being a shrewd businessman, along with his successful racketeering, led to Patriarca appointing him underboss of the Providence, Rhode Island-based Patriarca crime family. Angiulo later headed up Boston's underworld from the 1960s to the 1980s. He and his brothers ran the criminal organization out of their headquarters at 98 Prince Street in the North End, the neighborhood in which he grew up. Capture Arrest In 1981, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) placed wiretaps in the headquarters and at a nearby social club, located at 51 North Margin Street, for three months. It was later revealed in a federal court that rival gangsters Whitey Bulger and Stephen Flemmi drew a diagram for FBI agents telling them where to plant the bugs. As Angiulo was being taken in handcuffs from the restaurant on September 19, 1983, he yelled, \\"I'll be back before my pork chops get cold.\\" Trial As Angiulo sat in jail without bail awaiting trial on federal racketeering charges, he was demoted from the mob. At the highly publicized trial, jurors heard hours of taped conversations of Angiulo and his associates planning numerous illegal activities, including murder, gambling, loan sharking and extortion. In one conversation, Angiulo ordered the killing of a bartender after concluding that he was set to testify before a federal grand jury investigating gambling and loan-sharking. The FBI thwarted the plot by warning the witness. At the eight-month-long trial, the mobster often sarcastically commented on the evidence presented and cracked jokes, prompting District Court Judge David Nelson to repeatedly reprimand him. Sentence and later life In February 1986, Angiulo and his co-defendants were convicted of \\"an avalanche of charges\\". He was sentenced to 45 years in prison on 12 counts of racketeering, gambling, loan sharking, and obstruction of justice. As his own lawyer, Angiulo argued numerous times, unsuccessfully, to have his conviction overturned. One argument claimed that he was framed by the FBI, Bulger, and Flemmi. In an affidavit filed in federal court in 2004, he wrote that he was in poor health and his term was \\"tantamount to an illegal death sentence\\". Angiulo, who had been incarcerated at the federal prison hospital in Devens, was paroled on September 10, 2007. He had been undergoing dialysis treatment since his release while living at his waterfront home in Nahant. Prior to his death, he was spending time with his wife, Barbara, with whom he had three children, Jason Brion, Gennaro Jay Jr., and Barbara Jay Angiulo. Angiulo died on August 29, 2009, at the Massachusetts General Hospital of kidney failure from kidney disease. His funeral was at the Joseph A. Langone Jr. Funeral Home in Boston's North End. In popular culture In the Whitey Bulger biopic Black Mass (2015), Angiulo is portrayed by Bill Haims.

Readfield is located on Wisconsin Highway 96 east of Fremont, in the town of Caledonia. Waupaca County Trunk Highways H and W pass through Readfield. Readfield has a post office with ZIP code 54969.ZIP Code Lookup  History  Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church stated intentions to build a church in Readfield in 1902. It still has a church there as of 2017. Readfield was on the original path of the transcontinental Yellowstone Trail auto trail, established in 1915. This highway through Readfield was first given the numerical designation State Trunk Highway 18 in 1917, which in turn was changed to U.S Route 10 in 1926. Construction began on the roadway which would become Waupaca County Highway W in the summer of 1928. The highway connects New London and Readfield. Telephone service for Readfield was provided for decades, at least as early as the 1930s, by the Larsen-Readfield Telephone Company. The company was purchased by Century Telephone of La Crosse in 1989. Century Telephone, now CenturyLink, still had the named subsidiary CenturyTel of Larsen-Readfield, LLC as late as 2013. In October 1960, the New London board of education approved construction of a school to be built in Readfield. It was slated for occupancy, and its first year, in September 1961, prepared to serve approximately 220 students. Smaller schools south of New London under the district's control (with the exception of the three room Dale school) were to be closed and consolidated into Readfield when it opened. Ultimately, Dale School was closed in the late 1960s and its K-3 students folded into Readfield's as well. Many of Readfield's businesses closed in 1982, when U.S. Route 10 through the community was straightened as part of a safety upgrade. The highway upgrades included curb and gutter for much of Readfield along U.S. 10; and for a reroute of County Road H to avoid a three-way intersection with County Roads W and U.S. 10. The highway changes meant the closure of Vic & Myrts' Supper Club, and Hanneman's Grocery Store and Rec Center. It left four businesses at that time, three of which were taverns. The fourth was a small variety store. On December 5, 2003, the primary route through Readfield changed designation from U.S. Route 10 to Wisconsin Highway 96, when the new divided highway for U.S. 10 between Greenville and Fremont was completed.

History Jim Falls is named in honor of James Ermatinger. In 1840, he established a trading post near the falls, which were then called \\"Vermillion Falls\\". Later, he became very involved with public affairs of the village and county. In 1854, he was appointed by the county Board of Supervisors, along with Henry O'Neil, and Daniel McCann, to lay out a road from Chippewa Falls to Vermillion Falls. In 1855, he acted as Justice of the Peace for Chippewa County. In spring of 1861, the Indian Ahgamahwegezhig captured an eaglet near the South Fork of the Flambeau River, within the present day Chequamegon National Forest, east of Park Falls, Wisconsin. A few weeks later, he canoed down the Chippewa River on a trading expedition. At Jim Falls, he encountered Daniel McCann, to whom he sold the eagle for a bushel of corn. In turn, McCann sold the bird to soldiers of the 8th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The eagle became their mascot Old Abe, who accompanied them during many battles of the Civil War. Statue of Old Abe located in Jim Falls on the Old Abe State Trail.Because of this connection, the reservoir behind the dam is named \\"Old Abe Lake.\\" Moreover, in a park on the Old Abe State Trail, which runs through the town, a 10¬Ω foot statue of Old Abe has been erected near the dam.

It is called wet storage stain because it occurs when a fresh zinc surface is stored in a wet environment with limited oxygen and carbon dioxide sources; the restriction in air is usually due to the items being stacked on one another or otherwise stored in close quarters. This type of corrosion does not usually occur to zinc surfaces that have had time to form their normal layers of corrosion protection.. Chemistry Wet storage stain is a white, crumbly, and porous substance that is a mixture of three chemical compounds: 2ZnCO3¬∑3Zn(OH)2, ZnO, and Œ≤-Zn(OH)2. Underneath the white coating is usually a dark gray surface. The corrosion product is very voluminous; it is approximately 100 times greater in volume than the zinc consumed. Because of this the corrosion is not usually detrimental to the usability of the item, unless the zinc surface is only a thin coating, such as zinc electroplating.. Wet storage stain only occurs in situations where there is a lack of oxygen or carbon dioxide, because it usually forms zinc oxide and zinc hydroxide in open air environments. These oxides are usually present on zinc surfaces, but do not protect them from wet storage stain because they are only loosely adherent to the surface and any moisture can attack the oxides from underneath. Also, chlorides and sulfates accelerate the formation of corrosion.. Removal To stop the corrosion from continuing the object just needs to be aired out to remove any moisture and allow the normal layer of protection to form. Washing and a wire brush will remove most of the corrosion. For complete removal, 10% acetic acid or a mixture of polishing chalk and 20‚Äì40% NaOH can be used. Both require a thorough water rinsing afterward and do not restore lustrous surface finish if one was previously present. Prevention Wet storage stain can be prevented for a limited amount of time by coating in a light oil, chromate conversion coatings, or phosphate conversion coatings. A more permanent solution is to paint the surface. References Bibliography *.

The pressure is then read from the gauge. Premix and postmix are two methods of serving ‚Äì usually carbonated ‚Äì soft drinks that are alternatives to bottles and cans. Premix Premix refers to a ready-mixed, ready-to-drink soft drink that has usually been packaged in 5-gallon stainless steel tanks called Cornelius kegs (or \\"Corny keg\\" for short). The premix itself is identical to the beverage of the same brand that is sold in bottles or cans, and is already carbonated. The soft drink is passed through a premix dispenser that refrigerates it before dispensing it through a pressure- compensating valve or tap. A premix dispenser is suitable for outlets that regularly sell the particular soft drink, but in relatively small amounts. At the plant, a quality control manager periodically checks the carbonation level of the premix tanks with a carbonation tester before shipment. Postmix Postmix refers to the system in which a flavored syrup (concentrate) of the soft drink is shipped to the retailer, usually in a returnable tank or a disposable bag-in-box container. At the point of sale, the soft drink is mixed to order from the postmix syrup, chilled and purified water, and carbon dioxide (from a gas cylinder), and usually dispensed from a soda fountain or soda gun. A postmix dispenser is a more sophisticated device than a premix dispenser. The postmix system is suitable for outlets that serve large amounts of soft drinks quickly, such as a sports stadium or a busy fast-food restaurant.

Biography  Paul Constant Eug√®ne Malengreau was born at Tr√©lon, Nord, France. He later changed his surname to \\"de Maleingreau\\". From 1905 to 1912 he studied at the Brussels Conservatory where his principal teachers were Alfons Desmet, Paul Gilson and Edgar Tinel. He began teaching at the Conservatory in 1913 and was professor of organ (succeeding Desmet) from 1929 until 1953. His pupils included Pierre Froidebise, Charles Koenig, Robert Kohnen, Marcel Druart, Paul Sprimont and Herman Roelstraete. In 1921 and 1922 he was the first to play Bach‚Äôs complete organ works in Brussels. Gregorian plainsong forms the basis of most of Malengreau‚Äôs compositions, and indeed part of his output is intended for the liturgy. He also wrote programme music, his organ symphonies being inspired by paintings by Rogier van der Weyden and the van Eyck brothers. While the chromaticism and cyclic treatment of themes reveal the influence of Franck, certain harmonic progressions are typical of Impressionist music. He was a member of the Libre Acad√©mie, and died in Brussels in 1956. Selected works :Publication dates and publishers in parentheses where known.

He acquired military prominence after leading imperial troops in the Great Turkish War, in the Nine Years' War, and the War of Spanish Succession. Life Charles de Lorraine was born 11 July 1661 in Bar- le-Duc, in the Duchy of Lorraine. He belonged to the Elbeuf cadet branch of the ruling dynasty of that duchy, domiciled in France. His father was Francois de Lorraine, Comte de Lillebonne, a cavalry commander in the French army. His mother was Anne of Lorraine, daughter of Duke Charles IV. His paternal grandmother was Catherine Henriette de Bourbon, an illegitimate daughter of Henry IV of France. Commercy was never married and had no children. He died during the War of Spanish Succession in the Battle of Luzzara. He was Duke of Joyeuse but after Charles entered into the service of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, Louis XIV confiscated the duchy and gave it to Charles' younger brother Jean Paul. Military career Initially Charles of Lorraine joined the French army. In May 1684, he abandoned the French army, in order to join the troops of the Holy Roman Empire. Commercy joined as a volunteer in the imperial forces in the Great Turkish War. In the beginning of the war he served as a consultant of Charles V, Duke of Lorraine, in his negotiations with Friedrich VII, Margrave of Baden-Durlach. In 1685 he took part in the siege of Nov√© Z√°mky, where he was injured. In the same year he was one of the commanders in the second Battle of Buda (1686), where he was also injured. On 11 October 1685 he was promoted to General Field Sergeant. On 23 November 1685 Emperor Leopold I granted him a personal guard of cuirassiers to reward him for his achievement during the Great Turkish War. In 1688 Charles of Lorraine was one the commanders during the siege of Belgrade. After the successful siege of the city he was promoted to Lieutenant-General. Commercy during those years became one of the most trusted lieutenants of Eugene of Savoy. After the outbreak of the Nine Years' War, he went to the Rhineland as a general of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1690 he defended the city of Mainz against the French army. In 1692 he was promoted to cavalry general. In the same year he took part in the siege of Embrun, during which he was shot. On 12 May 1696 he was promoted to imperial Field Marshal and led Austrian troops in the War of the Spanish Succession. He took part in the Battle of Carpi and in the Battle of Chiari on 1 September 1701. On 1 February 1702 he was one of the commanders of the during the Battle of Cremona. He died on 15 August 1702 during the Battle of Luzzara in Cremona, after being shot several times. Charles of Lorraine was buried in Nancy in the graveyard of the House of Lorraine.

The chapter specifically dealing with nationalism was later expanded to form the basis of Gellner's most famous book, Nations and Nationalism (1983). They also note that rather than looking at the internal coherence of philosophies, Gellner places them in their historical context. He thus explains their origins and their likely influence.

She was originally built as the privateer Hercules, which in November the British captured. She went on to serve during the Fourth Anglo- Dutch War and the subsequent years of peace. The privateer was one of two captured in the North Sea at the same time, both of which the Royal Navy took into service. Pylades went on to serve under several commanders, spending most of her career sailing in the English Channel. She did not survive to see service in the French Revolutionary Wars, having been sold for breaking up in March 1790. Dutch service Hercules was built at Amsterdam in 1781, to prey on British shipping during the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. On 30 November she sailed from the Texel with another large privateer, Mars. The vessels were commanded by a father and son team named Hogenboome; the father had been active as a privateer operating out of Flushing during the Seven Years' War under the alias John Hardapple. The two vessels were estimated to have cost upwards of ¬£20,000. Their career as privateers was short-lived. They managed to capture only a single British fishing smack before the 40-gun frigate , under the command of Captain John MacBride, sighted them off Flamborough Head at 10 o'clock in the morning on 3 December. Capture The two Dutch vessels initially approached Artois, apparently appearing 'confident'. The action began at 2pm, with one privateer standing off Artoiss bow, while the other attacked her quarter. MacBride concentrated his fire on the ship on his quarter, forcing her to break away, while he turned his attention to the ship off his bow. After thirty minutes this ship surrendered, while the other attempted to escape. MacBride wore around and chased her down, at which she struck her colours. MacBride wrote in his report that the two ships mounted '24 nine-pounders and ten cohorns each.' He described them as 'perfectly new, and alike; sail as fast as the Artois, and are the completest privateers I ever saw.' Hercules was described as carrying 164 men, of whom thirteen were killed and twenty were wounded. Artois had one man killed and six wounded in the whole engagement. Impressed by MacBride's report, the Admiralty approved their purchase for service with the Royal Navy, and she was registered as the sloop HMS Pylades on 16 February 1782. MacBride's report, though it convinced the Admiralty to acquire the two ships, was apparently greeted with 'much mirth, on account of the singular manner in which it was worded'. Royal Navy service Pylades was fitted out at Deptford between February and 16 October 1782, with her armament consisting of 18 short nine-pounders and ten ¬Ω-pounder swivel guns. The cost for her to be fitted and coppered came to ¬£3,719 5s 7d. Pylades was commissioned in August 1782 under her first captain, Lieutenant John Osborn. Osborn was promoted to the rank of master and commander in January 1783, and remained in command until 1786. During this time Pylades was paid off in May 1783 but recommissioned that same month under Osborn with orders to patrol in the Western Approaches. On 6 October 1785, Pylades stationed a cutter off the Ram Head to intercept any smuggling boats that might attempt to land. When she discovered a small cutter lying-to, and several boats near the unknown vessel, Pyladess boat rowed alongside. At this point, the smugglers fired a swivel that killed one of Pyladess men, and escaped. The Crown offered a pardon to anyone (other than the actual perpetrator himself) to any of the smugglers that provided information that would result in the arrest of the perpetrator and the other smugglers. The Crown also offered a reward of ¬£100 to the same end. Osborn left Pylades in 1786. Pylades recommissioned in November that year under her new captain, Commander Davidge Gould, who was stationed off the Start. Fate Commander John Stevens Hall became Pyladess new captain in or around March 1789, and served as such until the sloop was paid off in December that year. Pylades was then sold for ¬£27 12s 6d and was broken up at Plymouth by 23 March 1790.

It is also sometimes referred to as the state principle . The state postulate allows a finite number of properties to be specified in order to fully describe a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Once the state postulate is given the other unspecified properties must assume certain values. The state postulate says: A more general statement of the state postulate says: the state of a simple system is completely specified by r+1 independent, intensive properties where r is the number of significant work interactions . A system is considered to be a simple compressible one in the absence of certain effects which are uncommon in many engineering applications. These are electromagnetic and gravitational fields, surface tension, and motion. For such a system, only two independent intensive variables are sufficient to derive all the others by use of an equation of state. In the case of a more complex system, additional variables must be measured in order to solve for the complete state. For example, if gravitation is significant then an elevation may be required. Two properties are considered independent if one can be varied while the other is held constant. For example, temperature and specific volume are always independent. However, temperature and pressure are independent only for a single-phase system; for a multiphase system (such as a mixture of gas and liquid) this is not the case. (e.g., boiling point (temperature) depends on elevation (ambient pressure)).

Accessed April 4, 2010: who is the son of Rustam. Manuscripts The history book Tarikh-i Sistan (history of Sistan) mentions an account of Faramarz (akhbar-e Faramarz) in twelve volumes, but this work, which was likely in prose, has been lost. Instead, two Faramarz-namas (epic of Faramarz), both in the form of epic poems, are extant. First manuscript The first manuscript, which appears to be older, is written by an anonymous poet who introduces himself as an admirer of Ferdowsi and is dated between the mid-11th and 12th centuries. In the manuscript he introduces himself as a villager from Piruzabad (or possibly an orthographical error in the text for Forsabad, a town near Marv in Khorasan). The poet states that he composed the Faramarz-nama at the age of thirty-six and his major source is a book by Azadsarv.Encyclopedia Iranica, \\"Azadsarv\\" by Djalal. Khaleghi-Motlagh Like other Persian writers of epic poetry who came after Ferdowsi, the author of this work was heavily influenced by the style of the Shahnameh. Second manuscript The second Faramaz-nama is a known book in 464 pages and containing between nine and ten thousand distichs. It was printed in Bombay in 1906 by the Zoroastrian scholar named Rostam, son of BahrƒÅm Soru≈° of Taft, a contemporary of Mo·∫ìaffar-al-Dƒ´n Shah (r. 1896-1907) who traveled to India to gather stories about FarƒÅmarz. Plot based on the first set of manuscripts The plot is about the voyage of Faramarz to India in order to help the Indian king Nowshaad(Now≈°ƒÅd) Shah on the orders of the Iranian King Kay Kavus. Faramarz was ordered by Kay Kavus to help the Indian king Now≈°ƒÅd Shah. While there, he slays KonnƒÅs Dƒ´v (a carrion-eating demon who had abducted the daughter of the Indian king), Karg-e G≈´yƒÅ (a talking rhinoceros), A≈ædahƒÅ (q.v.; a dragon), and thirty thousand rhinoceroses. He then leaves for the land of JaypƒÅl where he has to accomplish seven labors or tasks. (compare with Ferdowsi who in his Shahnama has also mentioned the seven labors of Rustam). The cycle of seven stages or labors is a model for heroic epics in Persian literature. The sixth labor of Faramarz is a debate with an Indian Brahman; upon its conclusion the Brahman abandons his belief in idols and becomes a worshipper of YazdƒÅn. This concludes the Faramaz-Nama which finishes without an account of Faramarz's seventh labor or his journey to JaypƒÅl. Plot based on the second set of manuscripts The story begins with the Iranian hero Rustam. During Rustam travels to India, Faramarz is born from the union of Rustam and the daughter of the king of India. The second section recounts the exploits of Banu Gushasp, the daughter of Rustam. Here Faramaz is cast as a secondary role and story mainly focuses on Banu Gushasp. The third section comprises the version of Faramarz-nama discussed in the first set of manuscripts above. The fourth section of the book contains about 6000 couplets of poetry, which gives another version of Faramarz's aventures in India and Qƒ´rvƒÅn. These exploits occur during the reign Kay Khusraw, and this section of the story may be considered a continuation of the first set of manuscripts. This fourth sections contains many episodes of Faramarz's adventure including: * His battle with the warrior Tovorg * His battle with the warrior RƒÅy * His battle with a demon called TajƒÅn≈´ * The return of Faramarz to Iran * The second trip of Faramarz to India to vanquish MahƒÅrak * His trip to the island of Kahƒ´lƒÅ1 * His slaying of the black demon who held the daughter of the king of Kahƒ´lƒÅ captive * The wedding of Faramarz with the daughter of the king of Kahƒ´lƒÅ captive * His travels to the lands of the East of India * His battle with the people of the island of Fƒ´lgu≈°ƒÅn (literally Elephanet ears) * His debate with the Indian Brahmans * The slaying of a roc and a dragon * His journey to Qƒ´rvƒÅn and the slaying of a dragon, a wolf, and a lion * His acquisition of Garshasp's treasures; his travels to the lands of bƒÅ·∏µtar (west) * His visit to the tomb of Hushang * His falling in love with the daughter of Fartur-tush, the king of the fairies, the disappearance of the girl in a spring, and his search for her. * His accomplishment of the seven tasks to reach the kingdom of fairies. * The seven tasks include the slaying a lion, a wolf, a rhinoceros, a dragon, and an ogre (·∏°≈´l), and traveling through cold and hot climes. * FarƒÅmarz reaches the land of Far·π≠≈´r-tu≈° and marries his daughter * FarƒÅmarz return to Iran where his wives give birth to two noble sons, SƒÅm who is the daughter of the king of the fairies and ƒÄ·∏èar-Borzƒ´n, whose mother is the daughter of the king of Kahƒ´lƒÅ. The exploits of SƒÅm are the subject of Khwaju Kermani's SƒÅm-nƒÅma (8th/14th century). The adventures of ƒÄ·∏èar-Borzƒ´nare are recounted in the last part of the Bahman-nama.

It principal thesis is that many centuries of intensifying wet-rice cultivation in Indonesia had produced greater social complexity without significant technological or political change, a process Geertz terms \\"involution\\". Written for a particular US-funded project on the local developments and following the modernisation theory of Walt Whitman Rostow, Geertz examines in this book the agricultural system in Indonesia. The two dominant forms of agriculture are swidden and sawah. Swidden is also known as slash and burn and sawah is irrigated rice paddy. The geographical location of these different types is important. Sawah is the dominant form in both Java and Bali where nearly three quarters of Indonesia's population live and swidden more common in the less central regions. Having looked at the agricultural system the book turns to an examination of the systems historical development. Of particular note is Geertz's discussion of what he famously describes as the process of \\"agricultural involution\\". This is his description of the process in Java where both the external economic demands of the Dutch rulers and the internal pressures due to population growth led to intensification rather than change. What this amounted was increasing the labour intensity in the paddies, increasing output per area but not increasing output per head. This was politically the most controversial text of Geertz as the Modjokuto project was a CIA funded project for CENIS at MIT.Price, David 2003. \\"Subtle Means and Enticing Carrots: The Impact of Funding on American Cold War Anthropology.\\" Critique of Anthropology 23(4):373-401.

Late in his career, Geertz reflected that the book had become an \\"orphan,\\" widely read and criticized without reference to his larger body of work.

The record has since been broken by his teammate Rod Arnold, but Pate remains in second place on Mansfield's all-time appearance list. He still lives in the Mansfield area. Included in his 479 first team appearances is a near seven year, run of 366 consecutive appearances in all competitions. In June 2009, Pate was honoured by the club when the supporters' bar at the club's Field Mill ground was renamed the Sandy Pate Bar.Stags' bar to be named after Sandy Pate, Mansfield Chad (29 April 2009).

Built in 1938 by Henry B. Nevins, Inc., City Island, Bronx as the Odyssey, the yacht was acquired by the Navy on 31 July 1942 from Mrs. Barklie Henry of Old Westbury, New York, converted to diesel auxiliary power in August and September at Port Everglades, Florida, and placed in service on 17 October. Service history U.S. Navy Saluda was assigned to the Port Everglades Section Base under the administrative control of the Commandant, 7th Naval District and remained there for outfitting. She was commissioned on 20 June 1943, Lt. (jg.) Edward F. Valier in command, and assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance for experimental work at the Underwater Sound Laboratory, at Fort Trumbull, New London, Connecticut. In December, she sailed south to St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, and thence proceeded to various Caribbean ports. In the spring of 1944 the vessel was used to test the theory developed by Maurice Ewing and J. Lamar Worzel of a SOFAR channel, or deep sound channel. A hydrophone was hung from Saluda to detect signals from a second ship setting off explosive charges up to miles away. Proof of the theory led to a development to use the SOFAR channel to locate downed air crews by detecting the explosion of a small charge close to the channel axis for detection and computation of location by shore stations. The long distance travel of low frequency sound in the channel was applied to the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) implemented in 1952 and continuing as a classified undersea surveillance system until 1991 when the mission and nature of the system was declassified. Elements of the system remain in operation. In the summer of 1944 the ship was under overhaul at Mayport, Florida. In August, Saluda was ordered back to New London and duty with the Sound Laboratory. She continued operations there until she was decommissioned and placed in service in October 1945, to be retained at New London under the operational control of the Commandant, 3rd Naval District. Saluda was recommissioned on 20 May 1946 for further service as an experimental test vessel. She engaged in hydrographic work with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, until September and then returned to New London for duty at the Sound Laboratory through December. Again decommissioned and placed in service on 7 January 1947, Saluda remained at New London under district control until transferred to the 11th Naval District on 8 January 1948. On 26 May, she entered the Thames Shipyard for overhaul preparatory to sailing for the west coast. Saluda departed from New London on 16 June and arrived at San Diego, California, in July to begin a long career of service with the Naval Electronics Laboratory. Operating as a silent platform, she was used in tests on experimental sonar equipment and techniques developed for undersea warfare. On 29 June 1968, she was reclassified YAG-87. Saluda was placed out of service (date unknown), and struck from the Naval Vessel Register, 15 April 1974. Saluda was reassigned to the Athletic and Recreation Department at Whidbey Island, Naval Air Station in Washington. During the next 4 years, she was described as the consummate party boat during summer time. A skipper and mate were assigned at the beginning of the summer and parties lasted until the fall. Sea Scouts Reverting to the name Odyssey, the yacht found a new home with the Pacific Harbors Council of the Boy Scouts of America in 1978, and now serves as a sail training vessel with the Sea Scouts of Tacoma, Washington.

Jackson, Naturi Naughton, Keith David, Charlie Murphy, Gbenga Akinnagbe, Terry Crews, Mike Epps, Loretta Devine and Ice Cube. The story follows a young man from Atlanta who wins a $370 million lottery, and soon realizes that people from the neighborhood are not his real friends, but are after his money. The film released on August 20, 2010, received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $24 million. Plot Kevin Carson (Bow Wow) is a young man living in the projects with his grandmother (Loretta Devine). Kevin dreams of one day designing his own sneaker line, but currently works at Foot Locker. His dreams are supported by two of his best friends: Benny (Brandon T. Jackson) and Stacey (Naturi Naughton). He comes across Lorenzo (Gbenga Akinnagbe), the neighborhood bully. Meanwhile, everyone in his neighborhood is trying to win the Mondo Million Dollar Lottery of $370 million. Lorenzo demands that Kevin gives him and his three friends three sets of sneakers each for free. When Lorenzo shows up to Kevin's job at Foot Locker, and grabs the shoes, the alarms go off and the police arrive, after Lorenzo claims Kevin gave him the shoes as a gift, he attempts to explain to the police that he did not intend to give the shoes to Lorenzo, Lorenzo is arrested for shoplifting and Kevin loses his job. On his way home, he buys a Mondo Millionaire Lottery ticket at a gas station, playing his grandmother's and his lucky numbers. He meets Benny, who tells him that the whole neighborhood heard that Kevin \\"snitched\\" on Lorenzo, and is even called one by their friends. Defeated, Kevin goes home and quickly falls asleep. Later, the numbers of the lottery are announced. Grandma's ticket doesn't win, but Kevin finds out that his own ticket has won him $370 million. However, when he and Benny head to the claims office, they are told that they must wait three days for the office to reopen, due to the Fourth of July weekend. News of Kevin's winning ticket spreads, and the entire neighborhood swarms him and his home, begging for a cut of the money. Nikki Swayze (Teairra Mar√≠) who previously rejected Kevin, suddenly develops an interest in him. This angers Stacey, who tells Kevin that Nikki is only after his money, but Kevin does not believe it. Kevin and Benny meet a loan shark, Sweet Tee (Keith David), who gives Kevin $100,000 to go out and have fun. After her date with Kevin, Nikki secretly tries to make him get her pregnant, but Kevin refuses. Nikki then reveals to Kevin that she was legally trying to get half of his money, by having a baby with him. He leaves the house angry and upset. Upon leaving the building, a man calls him from the basement window. Kevin meets Mr. Washington (Ice Cube), a retired boxer, who invites him to his house for a conversation. The next day, Kevin attends church with his grandmother until Benny comes in and tells him that Lorenzo is looking for him and the ticket. Lorenzo comes in and is stopped by the churchgoers. Kevin tries to escape, but he's confronted by Lorenzo's crew. Sweet Tee's bodyguard saves Kevin with his gun, but Lorenzo emerges and physically breaks his hand. Then, Kevin runs to the train station with Lorenzo and his boys chasing him. Kevin leaps onto the train thinking he's safe, but Lorenzo gets on, too. However Kevin hops off before the doors close. The train leaves the station with Lorenzo on. Later that day, Kevin and Benny have an argument about the ticket which leads to them not speaking to each other. He goes to Stacey's house, and she tells Kevin that she thinks he was wrong about the entire situation. He also tells her that she is the girl for him, which leads to her getting angry and telling him to get out. He kisses her and she responds accordingly, but they are interrupted by the arrival of her mother. As Kevin leaves her house, Lorenzo knocks him unconscious and takes one of Kevin's sneakers and ticket. The following day, he wakes up in the apartment of Mr. Washington, who talks with him. Kevin also takes time to reconcile with Benny. They make a scheme to fool Lorenzo that the ticket is fake, which later upsets Lorenzo. Later, the neighborhood has a block party and Kevin learns that Sweet Tee will torture him if he doesn't pay back the loan. Lorenzo arrives, defeats Sweet Tee and beats Kevin to the point where he forces Kevin to give him the fake ticket through gunpoint. Just as Kevin submits, Mr. Washington appears from behind and knocks Lorenzo unconscious, being hailed a hero to the neighborhood. Afterwards, Benny tells Kevin to give him the lottery ticket for protection and when the day came, Kevin gets the money. Months later, Kevin started his sneaker company with Benny as his CEO and Stacy as his future attorney and is implied to have paid Sweet Tee back. He also opens a park with Mr. Washington appointed as head security and a foundation that will help the community such as fund businesses and provide scholarships. After giving a speech to the neighborhood, Kevin, Benny and Stacey board Kevin's new helicopter and fly off to work.

M. validus, once thought to be the type species of Machaeroprosopus, was named in 1916 on the basis of three complete skulls from Chinle Formation, Arizona. The skulls have been lost since the 1950s, and a line drawing in the original 1916 description is the only visual record of the specimen. Another species, M. andersoni, was named in 1922 from New Mexico, and the species M. adamanensis, M. gregorii, M. lithodendrorum, M. tenuis, and M. zunii were named in 1930. Most species have been reassigned to the genera Smilosuchus, Rutiodon, Pseudopalatus, or Phytosaurus. Until recently, M. validus was considered to be the only species that has not been reassigned. Thus, Machaeroprosopus was considered to be a nomen dubium or \\"doubtful name\\" because of the lack of diagnostic specimens that can support its distinction from other phytosaur genera. However, a taxonomic revision of Machaeroprosopus, conducted by Parker et al. (in press), revealed that UW 3807, the holotype of M. validus, is not the holotype of Machaeroprosopus, while the previously named species Pseudopalatus buceros has priority as the type species of the genus. Therefore, the name Pseudopalatus must be considered a junior synonym of Machaeroprosopus, and all species of the former must be reassigned to the later. This revised taxonomy was already accepted in several studies, including Stocker and Butler (2013). Stocker and Butler (2013) also treated M. andersoni as a valid species, and not a junior synonym of Machaeroprosopus buceros as was previously suggested by Long and Murry (1995). Species M. andersoni Skull of M. andersoni M. andersoni was first described and named by Maurice G. Mehl in 1922, on the basis of the holotype FMNH UC 396, partial skull. It was probably collected from the Bull Canyon Formation of the Chinle Group or Dockum Group, probably at the Bull Canyon, in the Guadalupe County of New Mexico. This taxon was considered to be a junior synonym of M. buceros by Long and Murry (1995) and later authors, although Stocker and Butler (2013) treated M. andersoni as a valid species. The holotype is the only known specimen of this species, although there are other specimens from the Bull Canyon Formation that were referred to Arribasuchus buceros by Long and Murry (1995), but not by Stocker and Butler (2013). M. buceros M. buceros skull M. buceros was first described and named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1881 as Belodon buceros, on the basis of the holotype AMNH 2318, partial skull. It was collected from the Norian-aged Petrified Forest Member of the Chinle Formation, at the Arroyo Seco drainage, Orphan Mesa in the Rio Arriba County of New Mexico. Later, the skull was occasionally referred to Phytosaurus buceros Jaekel (1910) erected a new genus for the species, creating Metarhinus buceros, however this generic name was preoccupied by Metarhinus Osborn, 1908, a brontotheriid mammal. Mehl (1915) referred this species to Lophoprosopus, as Lophoprosopus buceros, but as the type species of this genus is considered to be synonymous with Nicrosaurus kapffi, Mehl (1916) erected a new genus for B. buceros, creating Machaeroprosopus buceros, and then named a new species of the genus, M. validus. Subsequent studies considered M. validus to be the type species of Machaeroprosopus. Later, the skull was referred to as Rutiodon buceros, Machaeroprosopus buceros or Pseudopalatus buceros. Long and Murry (1995) erected a new genus for the species, not knowing that M. validus was not in fact the type species of Machaeroprosopus, creating Arribasuchus buceros. Subsequent studies, including Hungerb√ºhler (2002), Lucas et al. (2002), Zeigler et al. (2002), Irmis (2005) and Parker and Irmis (2006), referred the species back to Pseudopalatus buceros, and considered Arribasuchus to be a junior synonym of Pseudopalatus. A taxonomic revision of Machaeroprosopus, conducted by Parker et al. (in press), revealed that Pseudopalatus buceros has priority as the type species of the genus. Therefore, the name Pseudopalatus was considered a junior synonym of Machaeroprosopus, and all species of the former were reassigned to the later, including P. buceros. Following the revision, M. andersoni was treated as a valid species by Stocker and Butler (2013), and not a junior synonym of Machaeroprosopus buceros as was previously suggested by Long and Murry (1995). Other specimens were referred to P. buceros by Long and Murry (1995), although all specimens from Arizona and Texas was later reassigned to other species (namely M. lottorum, M. mccauleyi and M. validus), and as M. andersoni from the Dockum Group was re-validated, M. buceros is currently known only from Chinle Formation of New Mexico. M. jablonskiae M. jablonskiae was first described and named by William G. Parker and Randall B. Irmis in 2006, on the basis of the holotype PEFO 31207, posterior skull roof and braincase missing the rostrum and palate. This specimen was initially referred to Pseudopalatus cf. mccauleyi by Parker and Irmis (2004) based on the morphology of the squamosals and the opisthotic, then to Pseudopalatus sp. by Parker and Irmis (2005) and finally to Pseudopalatus jablonskiae by Parker and Irmis (2006). It was collected in September 2002 from the lower Jim Camp Wash beds, Sonsela Member of the Chinle Formation, at locality PFV 295, near Mountain Lion Mesa in Petrified Forest National Park, Arizona. The specific name honors Pat Jablonsky, who discovered the holotype and only known specimen. Following the taxonomic revision of Machaeroprosopus by Parker et al. (in press), all species of Pseudopalatus, including P. jablonskiae, were reassigned to Machaeroprosopus. This was already accepted by Stocker and Butler (2013). Although M. jablonskiae is known from an incomplete specimen, it can be diagnosed by at least one autapomorphy and a unique suite of traits, and it includes a well-preserved braincase, which is rarely preserved or described in detail for most phytosaur specimens. A phylogenetic analysis of pseudopalatine phytosaurs performed by Parker and Irmis (2006) found the species to be the most basal species of \\"Pseudopalatus\\". M. lottorum M. lottorum skull M. lottorum was first described and named by Axel Hungerb√ºhler, Bill Mueller, Sankar Chatterjee and Douglas P. Cunningham in 2013. The specific name honors John Lott and Patricia Lott Kirkpatrick, for their support during the work at the TTU VPL 3870. It is known from two complete skulls, the holotype TTU-P10076 and the paratype TTU-P10077 housed at Texas Tech University. The skulls were collected at Patricia Site (TTU Vertebrate Paleontology Locality 3870), 13 km South of Post, Garza County of west Texas, from the upper unit of the Norian Cooper Canyon Formation, Dockum Group. Other vertebrates known from this site include TTU-P10074, a partial skull referred to Machaeroprosopus sp., a phytosaur postcranial skeleton, fish, a temnospondyl amphibian, Typothorax, Postosuchus, Shuvosaurus and a theropod dinosaur. A phylogenetic analysis of pseudopalatine phytosaurs performed by Hungerb√ºhler et al. (2013) found the species to be a derived Machaeroprosopus species, most closely related to the type species of Redondasaurus, \\"R.\\" gregorii. This clade in addition to Machaeroprosopus sp. (TTU-P10074) was recovered as the sister taxon of the clade formed by M. pristinus and M. buceros. M. jablonskiae, M. mccauleyi and \\"Redondasaurus\\" bermani were found to be basal species of Machaeroprosopus. M. mccauleyi M. mccauleyi skull M. mccauleyi was first described and named by Karen A. Ballew in 1989 as a species of Pseudopalatus, on the basis of the holotype UCMP 126999, an incomplete skull, lacking the anterior half of the rostrum, and probably associated lower jaws. The specific name honors John D. McCauley and Mrs. Molly McCauley McLean from Winslow, Arizona, the owners of the land at \\"Billings Gap\\" from which the holotype was found. The specimen was originally informally designated as Pseudopalatus \\"bilingsensis\\" by Ballew (1986). It was collected at Dry Creek Tank SE (also known as UCMP V82040, UCMP 7043 and PFV 55), Apache County of Arizona, from the Norian-aged Upper Petrified Forest Member / Formation according to most authors, or possibly Sonsela Member of the Chinle Formation according to Parker & Irmis (2005). Ballew (1989) also referred to this species USNM 15839, another incomplete skull lacking the anterior half of the rostrum from Arizona. Long and Murry (1995) restricted this species to its holotype, although recent studies suggest that USNM 15839 is referable to it. Long and Murry (1995) also considered M. mccauleyi to be a species of their Arribasuchus, probably synonymous with A. buceros, although most subsequent studies, like Hungerb√ºhler (2002), Parker and Irmis (2006), Stocker (2010) and Stocker and Butler (2013) treated M. mccauleyi as a valid species. Other specimens that are currently referred to M. mccauleyi include PEFO 31219, complete skull, lower jaws and articulated postcranial skeleton, from Petroglyph phytosaur site (also known as PFV 42) collected by UCMP in 1985, and possibly UCMP 27149, a large skull, from Cowboy (UCMP A257), both from the Petrified Forest Member, Arizona. Both specimen were originally referred to A. buceros by Long and Murry (1995). M. pristinus M. pristinus skull M. pristinus was first described and named by Maurice G. Mehl in 1928 as the type species of Pseudopalatus, Pseudopalatus pristinus, on the basis of the holotype MU 525, nearly complete skull. It was collected, from the Norian-aged Upper Petrified Forest Member of the Chinle Formation, near Adamana, Arizona. Additional skulls and postcranial material, some articulated skeletons, from the same member were referred to this species by Colbert (1946) and Long and Murry (1995) from Arizona, and by Lawler (1979), Ballew (1986) and Long and Murry (1995) from New Mexico. Charles Camp (1930) described and named Machaeroprosopus tenuis on the basis of UCMP 27018, a nearly complete skull, lower jaws, and some complete postcranial material, from the Billings Gap locality (UCMP 7043, Upper Petrified Forest Member), Apache County of Arizona. This specimen was occasionally referred to as Rutiodon tenuis, although since Long and Murry (1995) it is considered to be a junior synonym of M. pristinus. Long and Murry (1995) also suggested that Redondasaurus gregorii from the Redonda Formation of New Mexico is a junior synonym of M. pristinus, although this was not accepted by subsequent authors. Other, then unnumbered, specimens from the upper Church Rock Member (Chinle Formation, Utah), Bull Canyon Formation and Travesser Formation (New Mexico) and Cooper Canyon Formation (Texas), were referred to M. pristinus by Long and Murry (1995), although recent studies suggest that M. pristinus is currently known only from the Upper Petrified Forest Member of Arizona and New Mexico. M. validus M. validus restoration M. validus was first described and named by Maurice G. Mehl in Mehl et al., in 1916 on the basis of the holotype UW 3807, a complete skull, and the two paratypes UW 3808 and UW 3809, partial skulls, from Norian- aged Upper Petrified Forest Member of the Chinle Formation, Coconino County of Arizona. The skulls have been lost since the 1950s, and a line drawing in the original 1916 description is the only visual record of the specimen. M. validus, once thought to be the type species of Machaeroprosopus, was suggested by some authors to represent the same species as Pseudopalatus pristinus. If this is the case, the name Machaeroprosopus would have precedence over Pseudopalatus because Pseudopalatus was named in 1928, twelve years after Machaeroprosopus was named. Long and Murry (1995) erected a new genus for Belodon buceros, not knowing that it was in fact the type species of Machaeroprosopus (and not M. validus), creating Arribasuchus buceros. They also suggested that M. validus might be a junior synonym of A. buceros. Line drawing of the skull of M. validus in Mehl et al. (1916) Until recently, M. validus was considered to be the only species of Machaeroprosopus that has not been reassigned. Thus, Machaeroprosopus was considered to be a nomen dubium or \\"doubtful name\\" because of the lack of diagnostic specimens that can support its distinction from other phytosaur genera. However, a taxonomic revision of Machaeroprosopus, conducted by Parker et al.

This revised taxonomy was already accepted in several studies, including Stocker and Butler (2013). Stocker and Butler (2013) also treated M. validus as a possibly valid species, and not a junior synonym of Machaeroprosopus buceros as was previously suggested by Long and Murry (1995).

Although Doctorow is unambiguous in identifying his fictional characters with the historical Collyer brothers, he changes many biographical facts in creating his story. Among the most overt are his extending the lives of the brothers by roughly thirty years into the early 1980s, reversing the birth order of the brothers, and making Homer, not Langley, the talented pianist.

It was founded as Svensk Flygtj√§nst AB by Tor Eliasson, who was CEO until his death in 1971.  History  Crownair Swedish Ltd AB formed in 1968, state in 1969 and with Linjeflyg as half owner since 1971 bought 1975 Svensk Flygtj√§nst AB formed in 1935 by Tor Eliasson and then changed its name to Crownair Flygtj√§nst AB Swedair. In 1976 the name Swedair AB was adopted. Statens offentliga utredningar SOU 1978:48 Budgetdepartementet/ Konkurrens p√• lika villkor When the business was the largest in the mid-1980s, it operated 50 aircraft of various types. The taxi flight took place with two-engine Cessna, type 402, 404, 425 Corsair, 441 Conquest and in the subsidiary Basair with Learjet 35. The target flight used MU-2 and Learjet and in Vidsel three Lansen. A DC-3 was used for the CAA's control of ILS facilities. The regular flight was conducted during the 1970s with DHC-6 Twin Otter on its own lines and later for Line flight and SAS. From the mid-1980s own traffic √ñrebro- Kastrup with BAe 31 Jetstream and traffic in Norrland with Fokker F-27 for SAS Commuters' predecessor COD. The major upswing in Swedair's regular traffic took place in December 1984, when the first copy of a total of 13 SAAB 340s was put into service. The traffic was to a large extent commissioned for Linjeflyg and SAS in Scandinavia and Finland and Poland. For two years in the early 1990s, a SAAB 340 flew between Berlin / Tempelhof and Brussels for SABENA. And last year, for a few months East Midlands-Brussels for British Midland and Cardiff-Paris / Charles de Gaulle for Manx Airlines. Operations with SAAB 340 were conducted with very high aviation safety. During 10 years of traffic with more than 10 aircraft, which flew everyday from 6 in the morning to 23 in the evening with a couple of hours of stops in the afternoon and reduced traffic Saturday / Sunday, only two incidents happened. Both took place during the winter in a blizzard when in both cases one of the main wheels came off the runway, but got back on the runway without any damage to the aircraft or passengers. SAS bought Swedair in 1993, but allowed it to enter receivership in 1994. Meanwhile, SAS was working on a major fleet replacement project to replace its Fokker F28 Fellowships with larger Boeing 737s. This would raise the size of the smallest jetliners from 80 to 120 passengers, too large for many of the smallest routes. SAS therefore started planning on expanding the SAS Commuter operations to Sweden. SAS Commuter announced on 30 July 1996 the order of four Saab 2000s, later increased to six. These would be part of a new division, Swelink, which would operate out of Stockholm Arlanda Airport. The first two aircraft were delivered in February 1997, with the next two arriving in April. The final two were handed over in January and March 1998. The main area of operation were smaller domestic services out of Arlanda, Kalmar, Karlstad, Kristianstad, Ronneby, Skellefte√• and V√§xj√∂. The aircraft were also occasionally used on the route to Gothenburg. Swelink was also used on three secondary routes to Finland, to Tampere, Turku and Vaasa.Hall: 201  Fleet  A Fokker F-27 A Mitsubishi MU-2B-25 This was the Swedair fleet for its existence * Cessna 402 * Cessna 404 * Cessna 425 Corsair * Learjet 35 * Mitsubishi MU-2 * Douglas DC-3 * de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter * Fokker F-27 * Saab 340 * Saab 2000 * Boeing 737 * BAe Jetstream 31  References  External links Homepages: https://web.archive.org/web/20110401042227/http://www.swedair.nu/ Category:Defunct airlines of Sweden Category:Airlines established in 1935 Category:Airlines disestablished in 1994 Category:Swedish companies established in 1935 ","title":"Swedair"},{"id":"24193547","text":"Fibria Celulose was a Brazilian pulp and paper company, created by a merger between Aracruz Celulose and Votorantim Celulose e Papel.

To that end the program operates under procurement procedures that permit it in most cases to designate the contractor. The sole- source arrangement that allows the pairing of contractors to specific requirements is paramount to the program's success. The program's mission statement begins: > The BIG SAFARI acquisition and sustainment system employs the necessary > flexibility to respond to high-priority, dynamic operational requirements > for programs that involve a limited number of systems that require a rapid > response to changes in the operational environment throughout the life of > the system. BIG SAFARI focuses on acquiring, fielding, and sustaining key > operational capabilities that otherwise would not be achievable or > supportable in the required timeframe. Events and processes are tailored to > meet the user's operational and schedule needs. The program was reconstituted as the BIG SAFARI Systems Group on 23 Nov 2004 and activated as same on 18 Jan 2005. It was redesignated as the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group (645 ASG) on 14 Jul 2006 and is now aligned as the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group (Big Safari) under the 303d Aeronautical Systems Wing (303 ASW) of the Air Force Material Command,https://www.afhra.af.mil/About-Us/Fact- Sheets/Display/Article/1140033/645-aeronoutical-systems-group-afmc/ although the program itself receives some direction from National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC). The 645 ASG (Big Safari) and the 303 ASW are headquartered at Wright-Patterson AFB , although Big Safari also has facilities at Hanscom AFB and Majors Airport in Greenville, Texas. The program oversees, among other aircraft, the RC-135 and EC-130 aircraft as well as unmanned aerial vehicles and remotely piloted aircraft. The Air Force has referred to Big Safari as a \\"rapid procurement force,\\" which tests the fielding of new weapons systems, sensors, and platforms. By some accounts, the program has been operating since the late 1950s, when the BQM-34 Firefly drone was procured and evaluated. This effort led to the first operational unmanned reconnaissance vehicle, the redesignated Ryan Aeronautical AQM-34 Lightning Bug. Programs conducted under the auspices of Big Safari are identified by two-word names beginning with the word \\"Rivet.\\" For instance, the RC-135V and RC-135W model aircraft are part of the \\"Rivet Joint\\" program. The program is still operational as of 21 October 2015.

Constructed by one of the area's earliest settlers, it was later home to one of Freeport's most significant citizens. After years of use as a house, it was converted into non-residential purposes, and it has been named a historic site. Daniel Easley settled at the site of Freeport circa 1804 after migrating from Virginia. The date at which he built the house is unknown, although it was certainly no later than 1820. Later in life, Easley journeyed farther west and established the city of Freeport in Stephenson County, Illinois. Before leaving, he sold his home to the family of John Reaves, who gained a posthumous reputation as one of the village's significant early residents. As a civilian, he was among Harrison County's earliest teachers, and villagers honored him as the first Harrison County resident to die in the war of the rebellion; he was even the first man in the village to enlist after the fall of Fort Sumter. Reaves' home is a small brick building with a central entrance on the facade,Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2.

Following Reaves' death, the house was converted into a commercial building; by 1888, it had become home to Freeport's first bank.

It has since become a library, the Clark Memorial branch of the Cadiz-based Puskarich Public Library.Clark Memorial Branch Library, Puskarich Public Library, n.d. Accessed 2014-02-17.

It is analogous to CPAN, the repository for Perl. Some package managers, including pip, use PyPI as the default source for packages and their dependencies. Over 235,000 Python packages can be accessed through PyPI. PyPI primarily hosts Python packages in the form of archives called sdists (source distributions) or precompiled \\"wheels.\\" PyPI as an index allows users to search for packages by keywords or by filters against their metadata, such as free software license or compatibility with POSIX. A single entry on PyPI is able to store, aside from just a package and its metadata, previous releases of the package, precompiled wheels (e.g. containing DLLs on Windows), as well as different forms for different operating systems and Python versions.  History  The Python Distribution Utilities (distutils) Python module was first added to the Python standard library in the 1.6.1 release, in September 2000, and in the 2.0 release, in October 2000, nine years after first python release in February 1991, with the goal of simplifying the process of installing third-party Python packages. However, distutils only provided the tools for packaging Python code, and no more. It was able to collect and distribute metadata but did not use it for other purposes. Python still lacked a centralised catalog for packages on the internet. PEP 241, a proposal to standardize metadata for indexes, was finalized in March 2001. A proposal to create a comprehensive centralised catalog, hosted at the python.org domain, was later finalized in November 2002. On , all PyPI traffic began being served by a more modern website platform: Warehouse. The legacy website was turned off at the end of that month. All existing packages were migrated to the new platform and their histories preserved.

The ship was launched in 1956; and she undertook her maiden voyage in 1957. She was a near identical sister ship to Empress of Britain.Cartwright, Roger et al. (2001). The Development and Growth of the Cruise Industry, p. 29. Canadian Pacific Empress of England was intended for sailing between Liverpool and Montreal. The ship was launched by Lady Eden, the wife of the Prime Minister Anthony Eden on 9 May 1956. ShipsList: Empress of England/Ocean Monarch Empress of Englands maiden voyage began on 18 April 1957. The ship sailed from Liverpool bound for Montreal, Quebec. Trans-Atlantic crossings continued until starting her last regularly scheduled crossing which began on 14 November 1969. The ship accomplished some cruises before she was sold in March 1970 to Shaw, Savill & Albion Line. Shaw, Savill & Albion Line Shaw, Savill & Albion Line renamed her Ocean Monarch. Initially no structural alterations were made. On 14 April 1970 she departed Southampton on a line voyage to Australia, arriving at Sydney, New South Wales, on 15 May. Two cruises to Japan (to coincide with Expo) were then undertaken, before the ship returned to Southampton. The vessel then proceeded to the Cammell Laird facility at Birkenhead for a major refit which involved turning her from a two-class transatlantic liner into a single-class cruise ship. This work included removal of the vessel's extensive cargo holds and cargo handling gear, installation of additional passenger cabins and the re-design of the ship's stern, to include a large swimming pool/lido area with a new bar/discoth√®que beneath. The refit took far longer than was scheduled, so Ocean Monarch was able to complete just one cruise in October 1971, before departing for Australasia. She sailed from Southampton on 5 November 1971, bound for Sydney via Barbados, Cura√ßao, Panama, Acapulco, Los Angeles, Vancouver, Honolulu, Tokelau, Fiji and Auckland. Ocean Monarch was then based at Sydney. On 12 April 1972 she departed Southampton for a round the world trip, calling at numerous ports, among them Las Palmas, Cape Town, Durban, Fremantle, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Wellington and Auckland, before continuing back to Southampton via the Panama Canal. In late 1972 the vessel returned once more to Australia, for a program of cruises from Sydney to South Pacific ports, remaining throughout 1973. In May 1974, Ocean Monarch left Sydney for Southampton for a further series of UK-based cruises. However, her schedule was disrupted by increasingly problematic main boilers, which defects would eventually seal the vessel's fate. Although the ship was sent back to Australasia in November 1974, mechanical failure in early 1975 caused a cruise to be cancelled, whilst the ship was dry-docked at Sydney and repairs were made. The ship left Sydney on 26 April 1975 for the last time. Upon return to Southampton in May 1975 the vessel was once again dry-docked and subsequently offered for sale. Ocean Monarch was sold in June 1975. The vessel left Southampton on 13 June 1975 bound for Kaohsiung in Taiwan where she was scrapped.

It tells the story of five unemployed workers who win the jackpot in the national lottery but their solidarity then proves fragile. Plot Five unemployed men in Paris are friends. Jeannot, Jacques, and Tintin are bachelors. Charlot (though the rest do not know) has left his faithless wife Gina, while Mario is an illegal immigrant from Spain who has got engaged to Huguette. Suddenly their lives are transformed when their syndicate wins the jackpot in the national lottery. After much discussion, which Jeannot tends to lead, they agree to pool the money. Rowing up the river Marne, they see a ruined laundry and agree to convert it themselves into a guinguette, a riverside restaurant and dance hall. Living on site and working all day, there is much bonding between the five but fissures also appear. Tintin plays the fool while on the roof and falls fatally. Jacques disappears with his share of the money. Mario gets notice of expulsion and hastily marries Huguette before complying. This leaves Jeannot and Charlot, who proceed to fall out over Gina, still legally married to Charlot, who not only wants to get her hands on Charlot's share of the winnings but easily seduces the willing Jeannot. In the original pessimistic ending, Jeannot's jealousy leads him to shoot Charlot dead, while in the re-shot optimistic ending the two men unite as friends against the woman's wiles.  Selected cast  * Jean Gabin as Jeannot * Charles Vanel as Charlot * Raymond Aimos as Tintin * Charles Dorat as Jacques * Rapha√´l M√©dina as Mario * Micheline Cheirel as Huguette, Mario's fianc√©e * Viviane Romance as Gina, the wife of Charles * Marcelle G√©niat as Huguette's grandmother * Fernand Charpin as policeman Antomarchi * Raymond Cordy as the drunkard Production The script was written by Duvivier and Charles Spaak, with Maurice Yvain provided the score. Jean Gabin's song Quand on s'prom√®ne au bord de l'eau was written by Duvivier, Yvain and Louis Poterat. Interiors were shot at the Joinville Studios in Joinville-le-Pont, Val-de-Marne, with exteriors at Chennevi√®res-sur-Marne. The film's sets were designed by the art director Jacques Krauss. Critical reception Critics have associated the film with the rise and demise of the Popular Front. The film was made in June and July 1936 and coincided with the early days of the L√©on Blum government and the strikes for better conditions. Duvivier was certainly not a Leftist. It should be pointed out nonetheless that Duvivier's portrayal of male friendship gradually being eroded by a woman and by desire for that woman was canonical by 1936, so the film does not limit itself to that reading. If the men in Duvivier's film do not get to fulfil their dream of setting up their guinguette it is because, while economically they can be solidaires‚Äîas one, sexually they cannot. On a first level of reading, therefore, it is sex before politics that drives the narrative.\\"Susan Hayward French National Cinema References External links * Category:French films Category:Films directed by Julien Duvivier Category:1936 films Category:Films scored by Maurice Yvain Category:1936 drama films Category:French drama films Category:French-language films Category:Films shot at Joinville Studios Category:French black-and-white films ","title":"They Were Five"},{"id":"24193817","text":"Albion Roudolph Foster (24 November 1875 - 6 February 1945) was a Canadian farmer, policeman and politician.

The Chase Home Museum currently has three permanent exhibition galleries and one temporary exhibition gallery. History The Isaac Chase flour mill. In 1847, Isaac Chase emigrated to Utah with Mormon pioneers and quickly continued his vocation by building a sawmill and gristmill on the outskirts of the newly formed settlement of Salt Lake City, Utah. In the early 1850s, Mormon leader Brigham Young partnered with Isaac Chase in his milling business as it prospered. At the same time, Isaac Chase built a two-story adobe house near the mills in the center of a farm. The Chase Home is a traditional two-story central-passage floor plan made of adobe bricks that were manufactured behind the home. Several changes have been made to the home over the years, most notably the additional of a rear cross-wing that functioned as a kitchen and a two-story portico to the front facade that emphasized the Greek Revival style of the building. The Chase Home was known as a gathering place for pioneers, leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and young people in search of entertainment.Sanders, William. 1998. Isaac Chase Utah Pioneer, 1847. In 1882 that farm was gifted to the State of Utah and became known as Liberty Park. Folk Art Collection The Chase Home Museum of Utah Folk Arts is the only museum in the United States that is dedicated to displaying a state-owned collection of contemporary folk art produced by Utah residents. A large portion of the collection comes from Utah's Native American population who used wood, willow, buckskin, beads, porcupine quills, shells and sequins to make things like baskets, cradleboards, clothing, jewelry, kachina dolls, drums and flutes. Utah's American Indian population includes those affiliated with land-based resident tribes‚Äîthe linguistically related Goshute, Northern Ute, Paiute, Shoshone, Ute Mountain Ute and the Athabaskan-speaking Navajos‚Äîand those from other tribal groups who have chosen Utah as their home. The collection also includes many items created by people who came to Utah through immigration and refugee programs. Although many traditional arts are modified or lost when people migrate from one society to the other, the most meaningful and symbolic folk art often persists. Folk arts focused on religious belief, identity, and community celebration are the most common. The folk art collection at the Chase Home Museum includes wood carvings, pottery, jewelry, baskets, textiles, and sculptures with roots in European, Asian, Hispanic, Polynesian, and African cultures. Other contemporary folk art in the collection at the Chase Home Museum include occupational folk art. Occupational folk art refers to items that are created for functional use in one's occupation, but often also reflect the aesthetics of the creator. Sometimes these items are created as decorative pieces to commemorate their occupational heritage and celebrate the skills that created them. Examples of occupational folk art in the collection include: stone carving, blacksmithing, saddle making, horsehair hitching, and woodworking. Location Liberty Park, located in Salt Lake City between 900 South and 1300 South and 500 East and 700 East, is the second largest park in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Italian La Luna di Carta) is a 2005 novel by Andrea Camilleri, translated into English in 2008 by Stephen Sartarelli. It is the ninth novel in the internationally popular Inspector Montalbano series. Summary Montalbano nostalgically recalls his boyhood and the memories of his family, remembering episodes that stayed imprinted in his imagination, like when his father pulled his leg by stating that the Moon was made of paper and he faithfully believed him. He now starts to feel his age, worried that he's getting old and has not loved enough, especially those closest to him and now disappeared ‚Äî a fact too late to remedy by showing his full love now, since they are no more.In the episode The Snack Thief Montalbano is contacted by his father's associate notifying him that his father is terminally ill and, aware of his impending death, did not want to make it known to his son, so as to spare him the agony of his suffering. In fact, Montalbano will arrive at the hospital when his father is already dead, thus bitterly reproaching himself for his selfishness because, even though aware that the father was sick, he chose to ignore it. Paper Moon follows the narration of Montalbano's inner crisis and his depression about oncoming old age, which seems to be afflicting him in mind and body. He meditates about death and the problems of growing old, with all its respective little impairments (loss of memory, sudden fears, loneliness and a propensity for crying). So he decides that the best way to get out of these bouts of melancholy is to dive head first into a new investigation. The opportunity is presented by a beautiful woman, who comes to the police station in order to advise of her brother's disappearance. Montalbano soon finds the man in a sort of pied-√†-terre, killed by a shot in the face and left in an obscene position: a suitable position, since the man was a well-known womanizer and had many sexual affairs with attractive women, one of whom seems more involved than the others, Elena Sclafani. The Inspector will not find it easy to solve the murder, pushed around by astute women trying to lead him to believe that \\"the Moon is made of paper\\".

It is so called because it was designed after a Saxon brooch, dating ca. 850 that was found in 1867 in Canterbury, England. General The original cross, kept at the Beaney House of Art and Knowledge, is a bronze cruciform brooch, with triangular panels of silver, incised with a triquetra and inlaid with niello. This cross features a small square in the centre, from which extend four arms, wider on the outside, so that the arms look like triangles, symbolising the Trinity. The tips of the arms are arcs of a single circle, giving the overall effect of a round wheel. As a stone cross is erected at Canterbury Cathedral and the crosses are sold at the souvenir shop there, the Canterbury Cross is familiar to those who made pilgrimage there. It is sometimes used as a symbol to represent the Anglican Communion. For example, in 1932, a Canterbury Cross made up of pieces of stone from Canterbury was sent to each of the Anglican diocesan cathedrals of the world as a visible symbol of the communion with Canterbury.A Virtual Tour of the Museum of the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, St. John's, Canada See also * Cross * Canterbury Cathedral * Anglican Communion * Table Plus References Category:Cross symbols Category:Anglicanism ","title":"Canterbury cross"},{"id":"24194351","text":"The 55th Delaware General Assembly was a meeting of the legislative branch of the state government, consisting of the Delaware Senate and the Delaware House of Representatives.

Quang L√™ has become a household name within the Vietnamese music industry worldwide, from the United States, to Canada, to France, to the United Kingdom, to Germany, to the Czech Republic, to Australia and back home in Vietnam. Quang L√™ achieved success at a young age, with hits such as ‚ÄúS∆∞∆°ng Tr·∫Øng Mi·ªÅn Qu√™ Ngo·∫°i‚Äù, ‚Äúƒê·∫≠p V·ª° C√¢y ƒê√†n‚Äù, ‚Äúƒê∆∞·ªùng V·ªÅ Qu√™ H∆∞∆°ng‚Äù and ‚ÄúT∆∞∆°ng T∆∞ N√†ng Ca Sƒ©‚Äù. Many famous Vietnamese songwriters, such as ƒêinh Mi√™n V≈©, personally write songs for Quang L√™ to perform on the Th√∫y Nga Paris By Night stage. Early life Quang L√™ was born in Vietnam, 1980(1981), with family roots from Central Vietnam in the City of Hu·∫ø. His Vietnamese accent is ‚ÄúHu·∫ø (central accent) ,‚Äù one of the main Vietnamese dialects in Vietnam, but he is able to imitate the southern accent, but he sings with a mixed accent. He is the third son in a family of 6 siblings, and one adopted sister. His family immigrated to the United States in 1990, and initially settled in Missouri. His family then moved to Orange County, California. Although Quang L√™ had been singing at a very young age, it wasn‚Äôt until the year 2000 that Quang L√™ took the step and decided to become a singer professionally. With support from his parents and encouragement from friends, it was not long after before Quang L√™ achieved major stardom within the Vietnamese music industry, which goes without saying that Quang L√™ was meant to become a singer. Singing career Prior to appearing on the very popular Paris By Night stage, a musical production created by Th√∫y Nga Productions showcasing some of the top performers in the Vietnamese music industry, Quang L√™ sang for a smaller music production called Ca Dao. He released three albums with Ca Dao singing ‚ÄúQu√™ H∆∞∆°ng‚Äù songs such as ‚ÄúNg·∫°i Ng√πng‚Äù, ‚ÄúEm V·ªÅ V·ªõi Ng∆∞·ªùi‚Äù, ‚ÄúChim S√°o Ng√†y X∆∞a‚Äù, ‚ÄúT√¨nh Cha‚Äù and ‚ÄúL·ªëi Thu X∆∞a‚Äù. He was even given the opportunity to sing with a very famous female Vietnamese singer at the time, Phi Nhung, on two songs entitled ‚ÄúNg√†y ƒê√£ ƒê∆°m B√¥ng‚Äù and ‚ÄúNg·∫´u H·ª©ng L√Ω Qua C·∫ßu‚Äù. Quang L√™ had submitted a video to Th√∫y Nga Productions but at the time, they did need singers to perform ‚ÄúQu√™ H∆∞∆°ng‚Äù songs. He waited two years before he received an invitation to appear in Th√∫y Nga's Paris by Night 66, entitled ‚ÄúNg∆∞·ªùi T√¨nh va Qu√™ H∆∞∆°ng‚Äù, an opportunity that opened all doors for Quang L√™ and started his journey to becoming one of the top selling artists within the Vietnamese music industry. On Paris By Night 66, Quang L√™ sang ‚ÄúTh∆∞ Xu√¢n Tr√™n R·ª´ng Cao‚Äù from songwriter Trinh Lam Ngan, and although still very young, it was his voice and his ability to perform with his ‚ÄúHu·∫ø‚Äù accent that the audience started to pay attention to this up and coming artist. Quang L√™ was invited again to appear on Th√∫y Nga's Paris By Night 68 entitled ‚ÄúN·ª≠a V·∫ßng TrƒÉng‚Äù. In this instalment, he sang alongside an alumnus of Paris By Night and another ‚ÄúQu√™ H∆∞∆°ng‚Äù singer, Tuong Nguyen, singing a mix of songs from songwriter Duy Kh√°nh. Quang L√™ appeared again on the Paris By Night stage in number 69 entitled ‚ÄúSong Ca N·ª£ T√¨nh‚Äù singing ‚ÄúS∆∞∆°ng Tr·∫Øng Mi·ªÅn Qu√™ Ngo·∫°i‚Äù by ƒêinh Mi√™n V≈©. It was Quang L√™‚Äôs cover of this song that the Vietnamese community began to recognize and respect Quang L√™‚Äôs voice and abilities despite his young age. In fact, in Paris By Night 89: Live in Korea, during his interview onstage by MC Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Ng·∫°n, Quang L√™ shared with the audience his experience meeting songwriter ƒêinh Mi√™n V≈©. Mi√™n V≈© had approached Quang L√™ at one of his shows and gave Quang L√™ two musical sheets he had written: one for the song ‚ÄúS∆∞∆°ng Tr·∫Øng Mi·ªÅn Qu√™ Ngo·∫°i‚Äù and the second for a new song, ‚ÄúHai Qu√™‚Äù. It is believed ‚ÄúHai Qu√™‚Äù is part two of ‚ÄúS∆∞∆°ng Tr·∫Øng Mi·ªÅn Qu√™ Ngo·∫°i‚Äù which Mi√™n V≈© wrote and has given to Quang L√™ to perform. Audience in Paris by Night 89 was treated to Quang L√™‚Äôs performance of ‚ÄúHai Qu√™‚Äù with his Hu·∫ø accent. Quang L√™‚Äôs career began to take off, with concert and show offers pouring in for this young artist and Quang L√™ became a contracted singer for Th√∫y Nga Productions, releasing various ‚ÄúQu√™ H∆∞∆°ng‚Äù music albums, starting with ‚ÄúS∆∞∆°ng Tr·∫Øng Mi·ªÅn Qu√™ Ngo·∫°i‚Äù which became the number one selling album in the same year it was released. The demand for Quang L√™ began to increase, pushing Th√∫y Nga to also release consecutively the following solo albums from Quang L√™: ‚ÄúK·∫ª ·ªû Mi·ªÅn Xa‚Äù, and ‚ÄúXin G·ªçi Nhau L√† C·ªë Nh√¢n‚Äù. In Paris By Night 73 entitled The Best of Song Ca (Duets), Th√∫y Nga decided to pair Quang L√™ up with another Th√∫y Nga singer, Ng·ªçc H·∫°, and the audience immediately fell in love with the duet. With their Hu·∫ø accents, Quang L√™ and Ng·ªçc H·∫° brought the audience back to the town of Hu·∫ø in the song ‚ÄúAi Ra X·ª© Hu·∫ø‚Äù from Duy Kh√°nh. This duet sparked more demand from the audience to see more of Quang L√™ and to couple him with Ng·ªçc H·∫°. In Paris By Night 79 entitled Dream, Th√∫y Nga paired the two singers again in the song ‚ÄúT√¨nh L√∫a Duy√™n TrƒÉng‚Äù from Hoai An and Ho Dinh and again in Paris By Night 94 25th Anniversary Part 1 with the song ‚ÄúT√¨nh Ngh√®o‚Äù showcasing a much more mature Quang L√™, vocally and appearance wise. Th√∫y Nga Productions made special ‚ÄúXu√¢n‚Äù (Spring) shows on the Paris by Night stage, starting with Paris By Night 76 entitled Xu√¢n Tha Huong. In this instalment of Paris by Night, Quang L√™ sang ‚ÄúXu√¢n N√†y Con V·ªÅ M·∫π ·ªû ƒê√¢u‚Äù, a very emotional song by Nhat Ngan. This began a series of songs for Mothers from Quang L√™ on Paris By Night ‚ÄúXu√¢n‚Äù specials. In Paris By Night 80 entitled T·∫øt Kh·∫Øp M·ªçi Nh√†, Quang L√™ sang the song ‚ÄúM·ª´ng Tu·ªïi M·∫π‚Äù (Celebrating Mother‚Äôs Birthdays). In Paris By Night 85, the third installment of Th√∫y Nga's ‚ÄúXu√¢n‚Äù specials titled ‚ÄúXu√¢n Trong Ky Niem‚Äù, Quang L√™ sang ‚ÄúXu√¢n N√†y Con Kh√¥ng V·ªÅ‚Äù. Audience continued to demand more of Quang L√™. The release of ‚Äú7000 √ê√™m G√≥p L·∫°i‚Äù brought Quang L√™ to a much more broad audience, as opposed to just the older generation. He continued to sing ‚ÄúQu√™ H∆∞∆°ng‚Äù songs such as ‚ÄúTh√†nh Ph·ªë Sau L∆∞ng‚Äù and ‚ÄúXin Em ƒê·ª´ng Kh√≥c Vu Quy‚Äù as well as a duet with another famous ‚ÄúQu√™ H∆∞∆°ng‚Äù singer, Nh∆∞ Qu·ª≥nh‚Äù in the song ‚Äúƒê√™m B∆° V∆°‚Äù from Duy Kh√°nh. Quang L√™ also sang with singer H∆∞∆°ng Th·ªßy in a very sweet cover and upbeat pop song ‚ÄúT√¨nh Nh·ªè Mau Qu√™n‚Äù. Quang L√™ provided a unique remixed to the song ‚ÄúXin ƒê·ª´ng Tr√°ch ƒêa ƒêa‚Äù by adding a trance mix to it, very different from what the audience expects from him. He also provided to the audience a romantic ballad in ‚ÄúH√£y V·ªÅ ƒê√¢y B√™n Anh‚Äù from Duy Manh, which attracted a different audience, mainly from the younger generation. In Paris By Night 82, Quang L√™ sang ‚Äúƒê·∫≠p V·ª° C√¢y ƒê√†n‚Äù by Hoa Linh Bao and received positive feedback from the audience regarding his cover of the song, not only from the older generations, but from the younger generations as well. His performance sparked the released of his next CD, simple titled ‚Äúƒê·∫≠p V·ª° C√¢y ƒê√†n‚Äù which again has Quang L√™ continuing to explore other music genres. He continued to provide to the audience with traditional Vietnamese music such as ‚ÄúChuy·ªán Ba M√πa M∆∞a‚Äù and ‚ÄúNh·∫≠t K√Ω Hai ƒê·ª©a M√¨nh‚Äù, a romantic ‚ÄúQu√™ H∆∞∆°ng‚Äù song loved by many from the older generation. The CD had a guest star from a very famous and beloved female artist, Minh Tuy·∫øt, who normally do not sing ‚ÄúQu√™ H∆∞∆°ng‚Äù songs but sang ‚ÄúB√†i Ca K·ª∑ Ni·ªám‚Äù with Quang L√™. Although not a common pairing, the two singers provided a nice cover of the song. Quang L√™ also duet again with H∆∞∆°ng Th·ªßy in another cute song called ‚ÄúChuy·ªán T√¨nh N∆°i L√†ng Qu√™‚Äù again about young love in the old country. He was also given an opportunity to duet with Qu·ª≥nh Dung, his ‚ÄúGodsister‚Äù, whom in a previous interview he mentioned was the one person he wanted to duet with. In this CD, Quang L√™ also explored a short ‚ÄúTan Co‚Äù number, a traditional music genre from southern Vietnam called ‚ÄúL·ª° H·∫πn‚Äù. He also sang ‚ÄúTi·ªÖn B·∫°n L√™n ƒê∆∞·ªùng‚Äù, a Chinese song translated into Vietnamese. He also continued to bring to the younger audience a romantic ballad in the song ‚ÄúT√¨nh Em L√† ƒê·∫°i D∆∞∆°ng‚Äù from Duy Manh. In Paris By Night 88, Th√∫y Nga decided to dedicate the show to the talented Vietnamese songwriter Lam Phuong, who has provided the Vietnamese community with a number of ‚ÄúQu√™ H∆∞∆°ng‚Äù songs. The show was called ‚Äúƒê∆∞·ªùng V·ªÅ Qu√™ H∆∞∆°ng‚Äù (Journey Back to the Countryside). Quang L√™ was invited to sing the song written by Lam Phuong, with the same title as the show ‚Äúƒê∆∞·ªùng V·ªÅ Qu√™ H∆∞∆°ng‚Äù. In this show, performances were done live and Quang L√™, appearing more mature in a black suite, open collar and longer hair, provided a very upbeat version of the song, with vocals. In Paris By Night 90, Th√∫y Nga put together a very special show dedicated to Vietnamese women. Quang L√™, alongside other singers, Khanh Ly, The Son, T√¢m ƒêoan, H∆∞∆°ng Th·ªßy and Thanh Truc was part of a very special performance dedicated to all mothers, called ‚ÄúL√≤ng M·∫π Vi·ªát Nam‚Äù. Quang L√™ sang the song, promptly titled ‚ÄúL√≤ng M·∫π Vi·ªát Nam‚Äù which describes the pain of a mother who must see her sons off to war and longingly waits for words from them and their safe return. Quang L√™ received positive feedback for his cover of this song, as he was able to pour so much emotion into the song, while maintaining very soothing and sweet vocals. In this show, Th√∫y Nga also paired Quang L√™ with a new singer to Paris by Night, Mai Thi√™n V√¢n, in the song ‚ÄúN∆∞·ªõc Non Ng√†n D·∫∑m Ra ƒêi‚Äù. The duet proved to be a success and requests for the two to sing again was overwhelming. In Paris By Night 92 Nh·∫°c Y√™u C·∫ßu, where the audience was able to send in requests to Th√∫y Nga, Quang L√™ was paired up with Mai Thi√™n V√¢n again in a very adorable performance of ‚ÄúG√µ C·ª≠a Tr√°i Tim‚Äù and the audience, young and old alike immediately fell in love with the two. The two paired up again in another cute performance in Paris By Night 94 singing two songs ‚Äú√Åo Em Ch∆∞a M·∫∑c M·ªôt L·∫ßn‚Äù and ‚ÄúV√≤ng Nh·∫´n C∆∞·ªõi‚Äù. Using his experience on stage, Quang L√™ improvised and teased Mai Thi√™n V√¢n at the end of the performance in order to advertise to the audience the release of the pairs‚Äô upcoming duet album. Quang L√™ released a new album with all his greatest hits. The CD was called ‚ÄúHai Qu√™: Platinum‚Äù and included songs sang on the Paris by Night stage including ‚ÄúTh∆∞ Xu√¢n Tr√™n R·ª´ng Cao‚Äù, ‚Äúƒê√™m Trao K·ª∑ Ni·ªám‚Äù, ‚ÄúH∆∞∆°ng T√≥c M·∫° Non‚Äù and ‚ÄúCay ƒê·∫Øng B·ªù M√¥i‚Äù. The CD also featured other songs requested by his fans included ‚ÄúM·∫•t Nhau R·ªìi‚Äù and ‚ÄúT√¢m S·ª± Ng∆∞·ªùi H√°t Rong‚Äù. While the Paris by Night was falling in love with the Quang L√™ and Mai Thi√™n V√¢n duet, his fans still loved his duets with H∆∞∆°ng Th·ªßy. The two again sang another song called ‚ÄúNh√† Anh Nh√† Em‚Äù about young love back in Vietnam. Th√∫y Nga decided put together a show dedicated to the three regions of Vietnam, ‚ÄúHu·∫ø, Saigon, Hanoi‚Äù in Paris By Night 91. Quang L√™, with a group of male singers, sang ‚ÄúT·ª´ Mi·ªÅn B·∫Øc‚Äù and ‚ÄúV√†o Mi·ªÅn Nam‚Äù created for each region. He also sang, with singer Kh√°nh Ly, performed a performance remembering the Massacre at Hu·∫ø, called ‚ÄúHu·∫ø M·∫≠u Th√¢n‚Äù. In this performance, Quang L√™ provided the audience with a very moving song ‚ÄúNh·ªØng Con ƒê∆∞·ªùng Tr·∫Øng‚Äù, of him falling in love with a local traditional Vietnamese girl and then finding her body during the massacre. After performing with Mai Thi√™n V√¢n in Paris By Night 92, Quang L√™ was given the opportunity to sing with his idol singer Y Lan in the song ‚ÄúT√¨nh Ho√†i H∆∞∆°ng‚Äù. During the interview on stage by MC Ky Duyen, Quang L√™ told the audience that singing with Y Lan was a request from him to Th√∫y Nga to let him sing with his Y Lan whom he has idolized for nearly 20 years. This is a clear indication of how much Th√∫y Nga appreciates and recognizes Quang L√™‚Äôs contribution to the Paris By Night shows. In Paris By Night 93, Th√∫y Nga decided to create a show mirroring America‚Äôs Dancing with the Stars. In this instalment, fans of Quang L√™ saw a very different side to Quang L√™. In previous Paris By Night show, Quang L√™ participated in cultural dance but not ballroom dancing. In Paris By Night 93, Quang L√™ teamed up with singer/dancer Thuy Van and treated the audience to a ‚ÄúRumba‚Äù dance to the song ‚ÄúBi·ªÉn T√¨nh‚Äù. Although he received high marks from the guest judges, Quang L√™ did not win the competition. It was definitely a different side to Quang L√™ and surprised many of his fans. Th√∫y Nga celebrated Paris By Night‚Äôs 25th anniversary with two shows: Paris By Night 94 and Paris By Night 95. While several Paris By Night singers got to sing in one song or maybe two if they are singing with other singers, Quang L√™ was invited to sing in 4 songs. As previously mentioned, he sang ‚ÄúT√¨nh Ngh√®o‚Äù with Ng·ªçc H·∫° and ‚Äú√Åo Em Ch∆∞a M·∫∑c M·ªôt L·∫ßn‚Äù and ‚ÄúV√≤ng Nh·∫´n C∆∞·ªõi‚Äù with Mai Thi√™n V√¢n. He also sang in a group song with all other singers in the Paris By Night show in the song ‚ÄúN·∫øu Ch·ªâ C√≤n M·ªôt Ng√†y‚Äù. Quang L√™ then treated to the audience to ‚ÄúT∆∞∆°ng T∆∞ N√†ng Ca Sƒ©‚Äù from Cong Thanh Bich. The success of this song spurred the release of a full album, titled ‚ÄúT∆∞∆°ng T∆∞ N√†ng Ca Sƒ©‚Äù. The album included more songs that were requested from his fans including ‚ÄúBu·ªìn Chi Em ∆†i‚Äù, ‚ÄúEm H√£y V·ªÅ ƒêi‚Äù, and a duet with Mai Thi√™n V√¢n, ‚ÄúC√°c Anh V·ªÅ‚Äù. There was a lot of controversy when Quang L√™‚Äôs name was taken off of the Paris By Night 96 Nh·∫°c Y√™u C·∫ßu 2 poster, much to the dismay of many of his fans. Th√∫y Nga was swarmed with mails, calls and even return of tickets for the show. Speculations that Quang L√™‚Äôs contract was over with Th√∫y Nga and that he would be joining Trung Tam Asia began to circulate. Many fans were not happy to hear this rumour. Quang L√™ did not appear in the Paris by Night 96 show but made a surprise appearance in Paris By Night 97 singing ‚ÄúHu·∫ø M√π S∆∞∆°ng‚Äù. This ended any rumours of Quang L√™ leaving Th√∫y Nga and put many hearts at ease. For the DVD release of Paris by Night 96, Th√∫y Nga included an MTV of Quang L√™ singing ‚Äúƒê√¥i M·∫Øt Ng∆∞·ªùi X∆∞a‚Äù. Fans got to see a very romantic side of Quang L√™ as he cried in the video to his ex-love on her wedding day (just all an act of course). The video also provided a promotional ad to Quang L√™‚Äôs new album with Mai Thi√™n V√¢n. Quang L√™ will appear next in Paris By Night 98, live in Las Vegas. Music and religion Quang L√™ is a devout Buddhist and performs at many Temples around the world. A major event which Quang L√™ frequently participates in is ‚ÄúL·ªÖ H·ªôi Quan √Çm‚Äù at the Vietnamese Buddhist Temple in Houston, Texas. Quang L√™ also gets invites from overseas Temple such as in France and Australia to perform. Quang L√™ was approached by Nguyen Dat, vice president of the Vietnamese Buddhist Temple to release a Buddhist CD.

(NYSE:IN),Intermec New York Stock Exchange Listing Yahoo! Finance he built the company from a small startup into the leading manufacturer of bar code and printing equipment.‚ÄúWay beyond bar codes, In its 40 years of business, Intermec has steadily diversified‚Äù Everett Herald, 2006-11-11 Prior to Allais' role at Intermec, he served as a manager for IBM. Most recently, Allais founded PathGuide Technologies, a Bothell, Washington-based developer of warehouse management systems for distributors.  Education and Accolades  Allais received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering in 1954. He received a master of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Arizona in 1958 and a master of science degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1962. In 1965, Allais received a doctor of philosophy degree from Stanford University. In 1988, Allais was awarded the Association for Automatic Identification and Mobility (AIM) Richard R. Dilling Award as a preeminent contributor to bar code technology and on October 16, 2009, Allais received the University of Arizona College of Engineering Lifetime Achievement Award.  Inventions and Patents  Allais is credited with creating five bar code symbologies: Code 39, Interleaved 2 of 5 (ITF), Code 11, Code 93 and Code 49. He is also named inventor on the following seven U.S. patents: * Patent # 3,001,369, Hydraulic System for Driving Several Actuators, 1962, Assigned to IBM.Patent 3,001,369 * Patent # 3,067,333, Motion Control Apparatus, Assigned to IBM.Patent 3,067,333 * Patent # 3,670,145, Tape Feed System, 1972, Assigned to Intermec Corporation.Patent 3,670,145 * Patent # 3,784,794, Electro-Optical Reader for Bar Codes, 1974, Assigned to National Bank Of Commerce of Seattle.Patent 3,784,794 * Patent # 3,844,210, Multi-Color (bar code) Printer, 1974, Assigned to Intermec Corporation.Patent 3,844,210 * Patent # 3,909,594, Circuit for Establishing a Reference Voltage in Bar Code Readers, 1975, Assigned to Intermec Corporation.Patent 3,909,594 * Patent # 4,794,239, Multi-Track Bar Code (Code 49), 1988, Assigned to Intermec Corporation.Patent 4,794,239 Interleaved 2 of 5 Allais developed Interleaved 2 of 5 in 1972 while at Intermec. It is a numeric only barcode used to encode pairs of numbers into a self-checking, high-density barcode format. The first digit is encoded in the five bars (or black lines), while the second digit is encoded in the five spaces (or white lines) interleaved with them. Two out of every five bars or spaces are wide (therefore 2 of 5). Applications include labeling corrugated shipping containers and identifying casino tickets. Code 39 In 1974, Allais and Ray Stevens, both at Intermec at the time, developed Code 39.‚ÄúRFID and Automated Data Collection News: How Well Do You Know Bar Codes?‚Äù Supply Chain Digest, 2009-07-15 Code 39 is a barcode symbology that can encode uppercase letters (A through Z), digits (0 through 9) and a handful of special characters like the $ sign. Code 39 is broadly used particularly in the automobile industry and manufacturing. Code 11 Code 11 is a barcode symbology developed by Allais while at Intermec in 1977.In 1977 Intermec‚Äôs printing and reading technology limited the density of Code 39 to 9.4 characters per inch. For numeric applications, Codabar provided somewhat higher density (12 characters per inch). However, at the time, Intermec was contractually obligated to sell Codabar printers only to Monarch Marking Systems. Interleaved 2 of 5 was not a discrete symbology and thus could not be printed at a high enough density by our drum printers. It is used primarily in telecommunications. The symbol can encode any length string consisting of the digits 0-9 and the dash character (-).http://www.aidc100.org/files/Allais- _David_Memoirs.pdf Code 93 Code 93 is a barcode symbology developed by Allais in 1982 while at Intermec to provide a higher density and data security enhancement to Code 39. It is an alphanumeric, variable length symbology. Code 93 is designed to encode 26 upper case letters, 10 digits and 7 special characters: : \`A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\` : \`0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\` : \`-, ., $, /, +, %, SPACE.\` Code 49 In 1987 Allais, while at Intermec, developed Code 49 as the next evolution in bar code symbology to solve scanning large amounts of data on small objects. Although the practical uses of Code 49 would be limited, it set the stage for the later development of PDF417, a stacked linear bar code symbol that is widely used.  Corporate Life  After receiving his master of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Arizona in 1958, Allais went on to serve in various engineering and engineering management positions at IBM in both California and New York state from 1958 to 1968. In 1968, Allais was hired as the vice president of engineering by then Interface Mechanisms, now Intermec. From 1968 to 1988, he served in a number of executive management roles at Intermec as executive vice president, president & chief executive officer, chairman & chief executive officer, and chief scientist. 14 of those years at Intermec were spent as chief executive officer. In 1989, Allais founded PathGuide Technologies and served as its president until 2006. PathGuide, formerly Applied Tactical Systems of Washington, develops, markets, and implements real time warehouse management systems and time and attendance systems. PathGuide‚Äôs warehouse management systems make extensive use of bar code scanning and RF data communications. Allais currently serves as chairman of PathGuide.

Although the House of Elzevir ceased publishing in 1712, the modern Dutch Elsevier company was founded in 1880 and took its name from the historic Dutch publishing house. Biography Isaac was the 2nd of Matthijs Elzevir's three sons and grandson of Lodewijk Elzevir, founder of the House of Elzevir. His publishing career spanned nine years and dominated the Leiden University printing business. Isaac began his career buying a print shop in Leyden in 1616 and by 1620 was appointed Printer to Leiden University. In 1625 Isaac brought the printing business of Thomas van Erpe with oriental fonts from his widow for the very large sum of 8000 guilders. With the oriental typography of the Erpenius equipment - including Syrian, Arab, Aramaic and Hebrew fonts - they acquired a monopolistic position in the field of oriental typography.P. G. Hoftijzer, Well-versed in many letters: Non-Western typography in Europe and Leiden up to 1800 A year later, in 1626, Isaac sold his publishing business to his uncle Bonaventure Elzevir and nephew Abraham Elzevir. Isaac left Leyden after selling the printing business and purchased a tavern in Rotterdam. In 1629, he abandoned innkeeping to become provost general for the Admiralty of South Holland, Admiralty of de Maze, and Waal. Later, he became a brewer with his two youngest sons. Isaac died in Cologne in 1651 while traveling on business.David W.

Biography Tsukada was born in Ishikawa Prefecture. In May 1916, he graduated from the 28th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry. In November 1924, he graduated from the 36th class of the Army Staff College. He was assigned to administrative work within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office. He later changed to the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service, becoming an instructor at the Hamamatsu Army Flight School in March 1933. He was attached to the staff of the Japanese China Garrison Army from May 1936 and to the intelligence staff of the Japanese Northern China Area Army from the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. In March 1938, he was promoted to colonel, and appointed commander of the IJAA 7th Air Regiment from June. In December 1939 he was transferred to become chief-of-staff of the IJAA First Air Brigade. Tsukada was promoted to major general in August 1941. In April 1942, Tsukada became commander of the IJAA 3rd Air Division, and from February 1944, chief-of-staff of the IJAA Third Air Force. From November 1944, Tsukada became commander of airborne operations training for the Teishin Shudan and commander of the 30,000 man Kenbu force defending central Luzon and Clark Field against the Americans during the Philippines campaign. A portion of this force, the 750-man 2nd Raiding Brigade, was an elite commando force assigned to attack American air bases in Luzon and Leyte. It inflicted numerous casualties before they were annihilated.In March 1945, Tsukada was promoted to lieutenant general; however, by early April his command had been largely annihilated, and he ordered his remaining me to fight as independent guerrilla units in the mountains west of Clark Field. The Alamo Scouts of the Sixth US Army were assigned to capture him, but he escaped and turned himself in after the surrender of Japan. He died on May 19, 1958.

The driver of the bus died at the scene and several passengers suffered minor injuries. It is thought that the bus driver was suffering from sun strike and did not see the train. *10 February 2020, Flaxton, Canterbury - the northbound Coastal Pacific collided with a truck at a level crossing south of Rangiora. The 31-year-old truck driver died at the scene. 2010‚Äì2019 *5 Apr 2019, Milson, Palmerston North - A log train struck an overbridge, derailing six wagons, with one overturning. There were no injuries. Closure of the main trunk line caused significant disruption to rail freight traffic. *9 May 2018, Britomart Transport Centre, Auckland ‚Äì The front three cars of an inbound train derailed in the Britomart tunnel on the approach to the platforms and stopped millimetres from a concrete wall. The emergency brakes were activated and no injuries were recorded. The derailed AM class units took several days to clear. The TAIC investigation found that a manufacturing defect in a rail caused the rail to fracture. *25 November 2017, Reefton ‚Äì The driver of a car died after the car struck a power pole and ended up across railway tracks, where it was then hit by a train. *20 October 2017, Masterton ‚Äì A passenger train collided with the trailer of a logging truck. The collision scattered logs across the road, but no injuries were reported. *27 May 2014, Melling, Lower Hutt ‚Äì While operating a Wellington to Melling commuter service, \\"Matangi\\" FP/FT 4472 overshot Melling station and collided with the stop block and overhead traction pole at the end of the line. Two passengers were hospitalised for minor injuries and shock. This incident should not be confused with the almost identical incident at the same station on 15 April 2013 (below). *2 March 2014, Otahuhu - An empty southbound passenger train returning to Westfield Depot derailed near Westfield Junction just before 2am. The DC locomotive and first SA carriage left the track, with the locomotive coming to rest on its side and the carriage remaining upright. The driver and train manager sustained minor injuries. The TAIC investigation identified two safety issues. *27 February 2014, Rangiriri - The southbound Northern Explorer travelling from Auckland to Wellington with 108 passengers on board collided with an articulated truck at the level crossing on Te Onetea Road. The 28-year-old driver of the truck died at the scene. The TAIC investigation found two safety issues contributing to the accident. *3 September 2013, Mercer - A northbound freight train derailed, leaving one carriage lying across the tracks, and two containers stranded on the road. An investigation is pending, but KiwiRail suspects that the incident was due to a mechanical fault. * 20 May 2013, Kaiwharawhara, Wellington ‚Äì The rear car of a morning southbound commuter train derailed just south of Kaiwharawhara station. Split pins had not been fitted to bolts on a spring park brake cylinder when the train was serviced ten weeks earlier; the cylinder came off the car and jackknifed the nearby air reservoir tanks, pushing the car off the rails and punching a hole in the carriage floor. Four passengers suffer minor injuries. *15 April 2013, Melling, Lower Hutt - at approximately 7.54 am, the two-car \\"Matangi\\" FP/FT 4149 failed to stop and collided with the stop block at Melling station at a speed of approximately 25 km/h. Nine passengers and two crew were on board. The KiwiRail investigation determined that driver error was the cause. This incident should not be confused with the almost identical incident at the same station on 27 May 2014 (above). * 31 October 2011, Paekakariki, Wellington ‚Äì A 12.6-metre-long three-axle low-floor bus became stuck on the Beach Road level crossing waiting at a stop sign to turn right onto State Highway 1, and was hit by a southbound freight train. No injuries were reported. The accident was caused by the bus stopping in a position where its single driving axle was off the ground above a drain, combined with an insufficient 'stacking distance' between the level crossing and State Highway 1, meaning any vehicle over 10 metres long could not stop without encroaching either the railway line or the State Highway. *1 February 2011, Ngaio, Wellington. At about 1 pm a Johnsonville bound suburban multiple electric unit derailed at the passing loop switch when leaving Ngaio station and ran off through a barrier fence, stopping about a metre into the station carpark. Although no one was injured, about 16 passengers were kept on board the train for around 20 minutes until the overhead electricity could be turned off, so they could disembark and continue on their journey by replacement bus. Services were replaced by buses for the afternoon but were restored by 7 pm. A crane was used to rerail the train. KiwiRail intended to investigate the cause of the derailment. *12 January 2011, Flint Road level crossing, Stratford ‚Äì About 9:15 am a New Plymouth bound freight train collided with a utility vehicle at a level crossing controlled only by stop signs, killing one person and seriously injuring two others in the vehicle. This was the fifth crash, and second fatality, at this crossing since 1992. Local residents considered the crossing was an accident waiting to happen because it was close to the highway, had limited visibility and many drivers did not stop for the crossing. They felt that barrier arms were needed. At the time of the crash, KiwiRail had been intending to install flashing lights at the crossing within the next two years, as it was high on the priority list to be upgraded. *30 September 2010, Plimmerton, Wellington ‚Äì At about 3.15pm a mid-afternoon northbound Wellington to Paraparaumu electric multiple unit hit a landslide on the line north of Plimmerton and derailed into the path of a southbound Paraparaumu to Wellington multiple unit; two injured. The drivers of the multiple units, who happened to be father and son, both survived by flinging themselves from their respective driving compartments moments before impact.The Railway Magazine, December 2010, p 10 The two heavily damaged components of the Ganz-Mavag units were withdrawn from service and the undamaged components marshalled together as a new set. The TAIC investigation found that no special track inspections were made and no speed restrictions were put in place despite rainfall well above average and a site at high risk of landslide. 2000‚Äì2009 *23 July 2009, Maymorn, Wellington ‚Äì The locomotive and first carriage of an evening northbound Wairarapa Connection derailed after hitting a mudslide at the exit to the Maoribank Tunnel; no injuries were reported, but the line was blocked for three days. *12 June 2008, Bryndwr, Christchurch, Canterbury ‚Äì Two freighthopping men riding on top of a southbound Main North Line freight train were knocked off after hitting an overhead footbridge and were killed. *1 April 2003, Silverstream, Upper Hutt ‚Äì Upper Hutt to Wellington Express electric multiple unit fatally struck a pedestrian at the Silverstream station crossing, despite warning devices operating. The coroner found pedestrians often ignore warning devices at this crossing and recommended that gates be installed to prevent pedestrians accidentally walking onto tracks. The first gated pedestrian railway crossing was subsequently installed at Silverstream, and served as a prototype for other busy pedestrian crossings.Leah Haines, Boy struck by train at crossing, 2 April 2003, The Dominion Post, Wellington. *8 December 2000, Christchurch ‚Äì Two freight trains collided in Middleton Yard after an inbound train failed to heed a danger signal, colliding with an outbound train. One engineer suffered a broken finger. 1950‚Äì1999 *20 October 1999, Waipahi, Otago ‚Äì A northbound Main South Line express freight train collided with a stationary southbound freight train after a misunderstanding of track warrant conditions by both train drivers; one killed, one seriously injured. One of the locomotives involved (DC 4202) was written off and scrapped. *21 October 1998, Rangiora, Canterbury - the northbound Coastal Pacific is unexpectedly diverted into the loop at Rangiora and collides with the rear end of the No. 2 shunt, stabled there awaiting the Coastal Pacific to overtake it. The accident occurred due to the points logic circuits reacting to an unusual shunting movement carried out by the No. 2 shunt earlier and the locomotive engineer of the Coastal Pacific having his attention diverted to looking for passengers on the Rangiora station platform to determine whether or not he would be required to stop at the station. One passenger suffers a broken nose and some members of the train crew sustain minor injuries. The TAIC made five safety recommendations. *14 March 1998, NgƒÅruawƒÅhia ‚Äì an unsecured load on train 235 hit a bridge while crossing the Waikato River. The train parted and six wagons were derailed with another five severely damaging the bridge. The cause was the movement of inadequately restrained stacked platform containers. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) identified three issues: the serviceability and uniformity of integral interlocking devices fitted to platform containers; the standards for transporting stacked platform containers internationally; and the understanding of and compliance with requirements for transporting stacked platform containers by rail. The TAIC made three safety recommendations. *18 June 1997, Glen Innes railway station, Auckland ‚Äì At about 11:50am an empty Silver Fern railcar returning to its depot and travelling at 80 km/h fatally collided with a pedestrian who had just disembarked from a suburban train travelling in the opposite direction at a pedestrian level crossing without warning devices. The coroner found that the pedestrian was unable to see or hear the railcar, due to the weather and noisy environment, and directed that warning devices be installed at the crossing, as a minimum. Also found that train drivers have a duty of care to pedestrians, despite having right of way, and recommended trains slow down near the station. *25 August 1993, Rolleston, Canterbury ‚Äì The driver of a concrete mixer truck turning right off State Highway 1 failed to notice the level crossing alarms on the George Holmes Road level crossing and collided with the side of the locomotive of a southbound Southerner passenger express. The truck's mixer bowl bounced off the carriages, ripping two open; three killed, seven seriously injured. *7 August 1991, Oio, central North Island ‚Äì Locomotive Engineer Graeme Peter Orange was killed and two 4000 hp EF class electric locomotives (EF30036 and 30088) were subsequently written off after striking a washout. *13 December 1989. Southbound Coastal Pacific Express passenger train derailed when attempting to avoid car versus truck collision on a railway crossing. *7 August 1984, Edendale, Southland ‚Äì An Invercargill to Balclutha shunt derailed after a section of track was washed out; one killed. *18 August 1981, Waiouru, Manawatu-Wanganui ‚Äì A Silver Fern railcar derailed on a curve and fell 8 m down a bank due to a missing speed restriction sign; four killed, 16 injured. *19 November 1980 - 3 coach southbound EMU derails after running into slip, north of Bean Pole Fence, on the single track section between Pukerua Bay & Paekakariki;Rails magazine *21 May 1980, Otira, West Coast ‚Äì An eastbound coal train derailed after a 50-metre section of track was washed away during stormy weather. Driver Owen Fitzgerald was trapped in the cab of his locomotive and subsequently drowned. *24 March 1980, Wellington, Wellington ‚Äì During the morning peak period a Porirua to Wellington suburban multiple unit train that was signalled to enter Wellington station crashed head-on into a diesel shunter with six empty carriages leaving the station that had somehow strayed onto the wrong line; two killed, at least 77 injured. Extensive testing found no fault with the signal system. The driver of the shunt locomotive was found not guilty of manslaughter for failing to stop for a red signal. *17 October 1979, Wellington, Wellington ‚Äì A Porirua to Wellington suburban unit rear-ended a stationary Taita to Wellington suburban unit on the approach to Wellington station; at least 44 injured, five seriously. *19 March 1979, Matapihi, Tauranga, Bay of Plenty ‚Äì A freight train went into a washout. One locomotive (DA 1436) was written off. The second locomotive Db1014 is rebuilt into Dbr1200. *25 May 1978, Pukerua Bay, Wellington ‚Äì DA 1470, returning to Wellington light engine from Paekakariki, derailed on a curve due to excessive speed and almost fell onto State Highway 1 below the line; two killed. *23 March 1977, Newmarket, Auckland ‚Äì At around 4:00pm a Wellington-to-Auckland freight train collided with an Auckland-to-Helensville suburban train near the Parnell Tunnel during a widespread signal system power failure after the passenger train failed to stop at a hand-signalled junction and continued running on the wrong line; the driver of the passenger train was killed and both locomotives (DX 2639 and DA 1426) written off. *21 November 1975, Silver Fern derailed in a level-crossing accident.Rails, March 1976, p13 at Feilding.'Silver Fern Railcar Derailed in Level-Crossing Accident'.

One killed (Rodger Michael Croad, age 18). *15 February 1971, Dashwood, Marlborough ‚Äì A Picton to Christchurch railcar collided with a cattle truck on a level crossing; one killed. *19 May 1966, Dashwood Pass, Marlborough ‚Äì A Christchurch to Picton mixed train (popularly named the \\"Cabbage Train\\") derailed at the southern portal of Tunnel 22, after the driver took a curve at twice the speed restriction; one killed, two seriously injured. *3 November 1962, Te Kauwhata, Waikato ‚Äì A northbound freight train ran a red signal and crashed into the back of a stationary freight train after the driver of the first train fell asleep at the controls; one killed. This crash sparked the introduction of vigilance devices in diesel locomotives. *5 February 1958, Pinedale, Waikato ‚Äì A Rotorua to Frankton, Hamilton freight train derailed on a curve after an air leak led to brake failure while the train was descending a 2% (1 in 50) grade; one killed, one injured. *21 October 1957, Wellington, Wellington ‚Äì A Plimmerton-to-Wellington suburban unit rear-ended an Upper Hutt-to-Wellington suburban unit on the approach to Wellington Station; 23 injured. *17 January 1956. Between National Park and Raurimu. Locomotive Jb1229 returning after banking No.227 express to National Park, derailed on a curve before entering the Spiral. Driver and fireman required hospital treatment for burns, abrasions and shock. Excessive speed likely, but speedometer had been removed for repairs before the accident. *26 October 1955, Waipuku north of Stratford. The railcar RM30 \\"Aotea\\" travelling from Wellington to New Plymouth struck a Ford Prefect car on a private level crossing which gave access to several NZR staff houses, killing three people. The driver Robert Reid (50y), his wife Moera (26y) and Arnold Cantwell were returning from the cinema at 11.09 pm, and the railcar was travelling at about 40 mph. The private crossing had poor visibility, and the car driver did not appear to hear the railcar horn. Reid (ganger) and Cantwell (traffic assistant) were both NZR employees. *20 July 1955, Takapu Road, Wellington ‚Äì A Paekakariki to Wellington suburban unit, after hitting a slip on the line, derailed into the path of the other line, and was subsequently hit by a Wellington to Paekakariki suburban unit; eight injured, one later dying of their injuries. *24 December 1953, Tangiwai, Manawatu- Wanganui ‚Äì Tangiwai disaster: An overnight Wellington-to-Auckland express fell into the Whangaehu River after part of the rail bridge it was crossing was swept away by a lahar from Mount Ruapehu's crater lake just minutes earlier; 151 killed. *5 December 1952, Kaukapakapa, Auckland ‚Äì A Maungaturoto to Auckland freight train crashed into a stationary Auckland to Opua mixed train standing at Kaukapakapa Station; one killed, one seriously injured. 1900‚Äì1949 *25 February 1948, Seddon ‚Äì Six people were killed and 63 injured when the engine tender overturned, causing the engine to also overturn, as the Picton to Christchurch express train was exiting a tightening curve.

Giustiniani was the quintessential Doge of the Republic of Venice, taking little interest in affairs of state. He had little role in the conduct of the Morean War (1684-1699), which was raging during his time as Doge, though a number of military victories were secured by provveditore Francesco Morosini, who would later be Giustinian's successor as Doge. Background, 1619‚Äì1684 Marcantonio Giustinian, Michele Foscarini and Gerolamo Cornaro, Ordini relativi alle paghe delle genti d'arme, 1674 Marcantonio Giustinian was born in Venice, the son of Pietro Giustinian and his wife Marina. From a rich family, in his youth he was given the nickname, Budella d'oro. A highly cultured man who spoke several languages, Giustinian served as the Most Serene Republic's Ambassador to the Kingdom of France. While in France, Giustinian used his great oratorical skills to convince France to provide Venice with funds that enabled it to carry on the Cretan War (1645‚Äì1669). Giustinian became a member of the Council of Ten, and held various offices, but never served in the most important positions. Giustinian never married, or even had sex with a woman, and he liked to boast that he had thereby avoided sin. He died in Venice. Reign as Doge, 1684‚Äì1688 Following the death of Doge Alvise Contarini on January 15, 1684, Giustinian was elected as Doge on January 26, 1684. This move surprised some, who believed that Francesco Morosini was elected Doge, but the Council preferred a pliant doge whom they could control, while Morosini was able to lead its military campaigns. This strategy led to Giustinian's reign being a time of military victories for the Republic, which were exciting for Venetians who had spent decades watching their empire decline, suffering military defeats, engaging in prolonged sieges, and generally being forced to agree to onerous terms in peace treaties. In 1686 and 1687, Morosini secured several dramatic victories over the Ottoman Empire, conquering Preveza, Kalamata, Navarino and the island of Santa Maura. Giustinian was a modest man who could not hope to compete with the martial victories of Morosini. During his reign as Doge, he was content to host banquets and festivals, and he gained a reputation for going to church so often that he was given the nickname of \\"St. Zuanino\\" or \\"the Doge of the Te Deum\\". In his four and a half year reign, all major decisions were left to his advisers, a fact which led some Venetians to criticize him. Giustinian died on March 23, 1688, following a failed surgery. Later, a humorous poem circulated about the two attending physicians, Ton and Dolfin (whose names translate as tuna and dolphin), claiming that the doge had been killed by two fish.

Originally established as the Balkan Arts Center in 1968, CTMD assists the city's ethnic and immigrant communities in maintaining their traditions and cultural heritage. CTMD has developed a range of programs that emphasize research, documentation, collaboration, presentation, and education to help advance its mission of cultural equity. Over the past four decades, CTMD‚Äôs programs have led to the creation of nationally renowned ensembles, folk arts festivals, and community-based cultural organizations. CTMD provides the public with a full calendar of events designed to showcase and promote the diversity of New York City's performing arts traditions. History In 1968, towards the end of the North American Folk Music Revival and shortly after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was passed to replace the U.S. immigration quota system, Martin Koenig established the Balkan Arts Center in New York City to promote and foster an appreciation of Balkan dance traditions. Over the next few years Koenig, along with fellow New Yorker and folk music enthusiast Ethel Raim, also conducted fieldwork for Ralph Rinzler in an effort to scout artists and performers for the annual Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife (now known as the Smithsonian Folklife Festival). Raim eventually joined Koenig as co-director of the Balkan Arts Center in the mid-Seventies, around the same time as the establishment of the Folk Arts Program within the National Endowment for the Arts and the enactment of the American Folklife Preservation Act. With the financial support of the NEA, Koenig and Raim proceeded to build an organization that would focus exclusively on the music and dance traditions of New York City's immigrant and ethnic populations. Originally promoting the arts of Albanian, Macedonian, and Greek cultures, the Balkan Arts Center expanded its operations into other communities as New York's demographic makeup shifted with each new influx of immigrants. Over the course of four decades and two name changes (the Ethnic Arts Center in 1981 and the Center for Traditional Music and Dance in 1997), CTMD has worked with dozens of ethnic and immigrant communities throughout the five boroughs. According to its current mission statement CTMD is a nonprofit organization \\"dedicated to preserving and presenting the performing arts traditions of New York‚Äôs immigrant and ethnic communities through research-based educational programming, public performance, and community partnerships.\\"http://www.ctmd.org/ Towards this end, CTMD has established and collaborated on a number of projects, including Community Cultural Initiatives (CCI), Sharing Traditions youth education programs, Touring Artist series, an extensive archive of audio and visual documents from over forty years of performances and events, the production of major festivals, the publication of printed materials, and the release of audio and visual recordings. These programs and projects are designed to advance the mission of cultural equity, a concept advanced by Alan Lomax in his appeal for the recognition of the right of every culture to promote and preserve its unique heritage and traditions. Programs Community Cultural Initiatives According to the CTMD website, the Community Cultural Initiative (CCI) program is \\"the Center‚Äôs most effective tool for advancing its mission of cultural equity ‚Äì the right of every cultural group to express and sustain its distinctive cultural heritage.\\" The multi-year CCI model places a strong emphasis on ethnographic fieldwork in New York City's ethnic and immigrant communities, collaboration with community members, documentation of events and artists, presentation of performing arts traditions to the wider public, and education in traditional music and dance for the youth. CCI programs are also designed to promote sustained interest in and financial support for the performing arts traditions of New York's diverse communities. CCI programs are generally structured in three phases occurring over the course of five years. The first phase, lasting approximately one year, consists of initial contacts with musicians and teachers, investigation and documentation of local performing arts traditions, the establishment of working relationships between CTMD and community members, and an assessment of available resources and pressing needs in the community. The middle phase of the CCI model, generally lasting three years, involves program development through ongoing collaboration between CTMD and local artists, teachers, and organizations. CCI programs conclude with a transition to ongoing and self-sustaining cultural activities within immigrant and ethnic communities, sometimes with the development of new or strengthened autonomous cultural organizations. Current CCI programs include work in the Chinese, Ukrainian, and Colombian communities, as well as the An-Sky Institute for Jewish Culture. Previous CCI programs have taken place in the Greek, Jewish, Italian, Irish, Puerto Rican, Albanian, Arab, Dominican, Asian-Indian, Indo- Caribbean, West African, Soviet Jewish, Filipino, Mexican, and Peruvian communities. Sharing Traditions The Sharing Traditions program began in the late 1990s as part of an effort to help foster awareness and appreciation among the youth of New York City's immigrant and ethnic communities for the traditional performing arts of their respective cultures. This program provides support for education in traditional music and dance, and has incorporated intensive classes and workshops for children in the Mountain Jewish, Bukharan Jewish, Indo-Caribbean, Mexican, Peruvian, Chinese, and Ukrainian communities. The Mariachi Academy of New York and Pachamama Peruvian Arts are two recent examples of successful organizations that evolved from Sharing Traditions programs. Touring Artists CTMD Touring Artists Program showcases performing arts ensembles from a variety of cultural traditions. Touring Artists works to bring these performers to stages across the United States in an effort to celebrate and cultivate awareness for the traditional performing arts. Masters on Stage: Major Concerts and Festivals CTMD presents both local and international artists each year through a variety of concerts, festivals, and workshops in New York City. These events include the Heritage Sunday Festival, produced in partnership with Lincoln Center Out of Doors, and the New York World Festival, produced in partnership with Central Park SummerStage, World Music Institute, and Lotus Music and Dance. The fourth New York World Festival planned for Fall of 2010 will feature musical performers from countries surrounding the Black Sea.

This consortium of archival collections is designed to provide a research network of printed materials, audio and visual recordings, and related information on New York City's immigrant and ethnic communities, as well as the history of the performance of world music in New York. The Archive of the Center for Traditional Music and Dance houses an extensive collection of audio and visual recordings, photographs, and printed materials documenting the Center's research and programming over the past four decades. The Archive contains recordings and printed materials from over five hundred events and nearly one thousand performing artists. The bulk of the collection has been digitized and will soon be accessible online to the public. Currently, access to the archive is available by special request. Recordings and Publications Over the years CTMD has published numerous audio recordings, films, concert videos, liner notes, and other print publications. Major recordings include the Ethnic Heritage Recording Series and the Global Beat of the Boroughs series, produced in collaboration with Smithsonian Folkways. A full list of recordings and publications is available on CTMD's website. Global Beat of the Boroughs Global Beat of the Boroughs is an electronic newsletter that provides information about CTMD-related events, artist profiles, and news from New York City's traditional music scene. The newsletter began in May 2007 and is currently published several times per year. Fiscal Sponsorship/Technical Assistance CTMD provides a variety of services and training opportunities for artists, ensembles, and newly formed cultural organizations. These services include: accounting and book keeping services; artist management services; banking / financial support services; budgeting assistance; development/fund-raising; fiscal sponsorship for tax- deductible contributions; letters of support; mail and fax correspondence; tax form administration; project planning; promotion campaigns; stage production; strategic planning; website development. Center for Art, Tradition, and Cultural Heritage (CATCH) The Center for Art, Tradition, and Cultural Heritage is a joint project of CTMD, City Lore, World Music Institute, and Society for the Educational Arts. Still in its planning stages, CATCH is being designed as a major cultural center in New York for the presentation and preservation of the city's living cultural heritage.

They are among the first original Canadian punk bands and first to emerge from Montreal. They are best known for their 1979 single \\"I Love Susan\\". History The 222s, who took their name from the pain killer of the same name, was formed in 1978, by guitarist Pierre \\"Al Cleann\\" Major and singer Jean \\"Frisson\\" Brisson. They were joined by bass player/drummer Angel Calvo and drummer, keyboardist and singer Louie \\"Louie Louie\\" Rondeau. The band played a handful of gigs around Montreal, mostly in high schools. Calvo was soon replaced by bassist Christian \\"Chris O'Bell\\" Belleau, while Frisson relocated to New York. Frisson's departure coincided with the recording of the 222s first single, I Love Susan b/w The First Studio Bomb, so Rondeau took on lead vocals. Released in the fall of 1978, on manager Fran√ßois Doyon's Rebel Records, I Love Susan b/w The First Studio Bomb was the first DIY punk single ever released in the province of Quebec. Just as the single was coming out, Chris Barry, a charismatic 16-year-old high school student, joined the band after being introduced by Rational Youth drummer Tracy Howe. Barry brought his friend, Joe Cerrato into the group to replace Christian Belleau on bass. Doyon then met with some gangsters from Laval who wanted to get into the music business. The band had been performing a cover of Michel Polnareff's La Poup√©e qui fait non; the gangsters wanted to turn the song into a hit, and offered to finance the band's second 7\\".. Recording sessions were held at one gangster's home but arguments broke out, to the point where one of the mobsters produced a gun. The band quickly finished the record. The 7\\", which featured an instrumental version of the song on the B-Side, was released in 1981 on Gamma Records and got a fair amount of airplay in Quebec, although the band was ashamed of it and thought it sounded terrible, especially because one of the mobsters replaced Barry's voice in the choruses with his sister's voice and his own. This accelerated the demise of the group; the band members didn't agree about their musical direction and, in November 1981, broke up. Over the course of their career, the 222s toured Canada as extensively as any band could. They toured in the USA with the Nuclear Accidents and, on several occasions, played New York's Max's Kansas City. There were also appearances on a local Community television show called The Musi-Video show, which was produced by Doyon's business partner Marc Fontaine. These shows have since resurfaced on YouTube and elsewhere and have sparked a renewed interest in the band. In 2007, Montreal label Sonik's Chicken Shrimp Records released an anthology of the band's demos under the name Montreal Punk '78-'81. Post-Breakup Pierre Major joined Montreal band The Dazzlers and Louie Rondeau teamed up with the 222s assistant manager Marc Fontaine in 1982 to form the successful synthpop group Nudimension. Together they composed a top 10 Quebec chart hit Amour Programm√© and, with Peerless Records in Mexico, the dance hit Rendez-vous(La Coqueteando)Psyquebelique 2009 Chris Barry was briefly in a band named Bram with Michael Bramon; they recorded a few demos but Barry moved to England, where he would join with ex-Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock and ex-Generation X guitar player James Stevenson in a band called Hot Club. It didn't work out, so he joined the Southern Death Cult, trying to become the new singer following Ian Astbury's departure, but that didn't work out either. In the spring of 1983, he was about to start a band with former The Police guitar player Henri Padovani, former Clash drummer Topper Headon and former Pretenders bassist Pete Farndon but the project ended when Farndon drowned in his bathtub after overdosing on heroin. Chris then started a solo project with ex-Generation X drummer Mark Laff. Broke and homeless, Barry returned to Montreal when CBS Records, which had heard the Bram demos, paid for his plane ticket. In 1984, Barry reformed the 222s with former members Pierre Major and Joe Cerrato. With the addition of drummer Andr√© Gagn√© and guitar player Richard Paul, they became the 39 Steps and released several albums . They also appeared (as themselves) in the Woody Allen movie Hannah and Her Sisters, playing their hit \\"Slip into the Crowd\\" at the CBGB. Chris moved to New York to join the band Pillbox (NYC), then back to Montreal to form the band Acrylic with bass player Roger Dawson, drummer Dave Jones and guitar player Klaus Frostell. Acrylic recorded an album that was never released because the record company went bankrupt. He then started The Throbbing Purple with Dawson, Unruled guitar player Michel \\"Wax\\" Cyr, and ex-Subhumans drummer David \\"Salty\\" Macanulty. In 2006, the band released the \\"Let it Writhe\\" CD on Sonik's Chicken Shrimp Records. 2010 Reunion In 2010 the original lineup of Chris, Louie and Pierre reformed and performed at festivals in Ontario and Quebec.

On December 24, 1998, Dr. Ian Gary Swayze declared Professor Starson (a.k.a. Scott Jeffery Schutzman) incapable of consenting to proposed psychiatric treatment and should therefore be involuntarily medicated as directed. Starson applied to a legal body known as the Consent and Capacity Board for a review of this decision. On June 6, 2003, the Supreme Court of Canada published its decision in the case. In a 6 to 3 decision, the majority held that Starson had the right to refuse medication. Background Schutzman, who changed his name to Starson and preferred to be called \\"Professor\\", obtained an electrical engineering degree and held a strong interest in physics (although it was not his profession). He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He appreciated that he was not 'normal' and that he had problems dealing with people. He acknowledged that he had mental health issues, but he refused to accept his condition as an illness. He also refused to consent to the course of medications that his physicians recommended for fear that it would diminish his thinking. He would have accepted psychotherapy but no medication.Starson v. Swayze, 2003 SCC 32 at paras 65-67. Dr. Ian Gary Swayze, who was not Starson's primary doctor but who had reviewed his medical charts, testified first. \\"[T]his charting is ominous. It would suggest to me a chronic, unremitting course which likely would be a future for Professor Starson, should he not receive treatment,\\" Dr. Swayze testified.Starson v. Swayze (2003) The Board decided that because Starson did not recognize that he was ill and that he needed treatment, the Board decided that Starson was not able to understand the consequences of consent; he failed to appreciate the risks and the benefits and therefore he lacked the capacity to make a decision as to treatment. Starson was subsequently charged multiple times with uttering death threats and has spent most of his later life in institutions.  Issue  Is the Board entitled to override Starson‚Äôs refusal and order him to undergo treatment? Holding: No.  Reasoning  The Supreme Court of Canada \\"ruled that Starson did have the capability and capacity to determine his own treatment.\\" Justice Major wrote the majority decision, that: According to the Act, a person is able to consent when he understands the information relevant to making the decision, and can appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the decision. The role of the Board is solely to adjudicate on the issue of capacity and not to determine what is in the best interests of the patient. Prior to the Starson decision, a person who does not acknowledge illness cannot accept the consequences of treatment.Khan v. St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital (1992), 7 O.R. (3d) 303 The court recognized that a person who has accepted the manifestations of illness, although not the final diagnosis, does not forgo capacity to refuse treatment. All the patient must do is be: #Able to understand the information about the treatment, and #Able to assess the costs and benefits of the treatment. The patient does not have to weigh the benefits properly or rationally. The majority also noted that psychiatrists do not always agree on diagnoses. So long as the patient can recognize the symptoms, then the court will have difficulty finding incapacity. In addition evidence given failed to meet standards of proof, the consent board made note over the vague references Dr. Swayze, made to medical charts and past death threats. \\"The medical charts themselves were not marked as exhibits at the hearing and there is no indication that the members of the board even looked at them,\\" Justice Molloy chastised. \\"The evidence of a non- treating psychiatrist Dr. Ian Gary Swayze based on a chart review and unsupported by first-hand evidence of anybody is far removed from 'cogent and compelling evidence.' It is contrary to the principles of justice to interfere with important individual rights on the basis of such flimsy evidence.\\" Major determined that McLachlin was doing what the Board did: deciding what was in the patient‚Äôs best interests.  Rationale  Denial of one‚Äôs illness is not a sufficient criterion to establish a patient‚Äôs incapacity to refuse treatment.  Critique  McLachlin CJ focussed on the delusions (such as that Pierre Trudeau was killed by aliens), where Major‚Äôs majority did not. Both McLachlin and Major agree that the issue is not a ‚Äúbest interests of the patient‚Äù standard. She felt, however, that the patient may be able to understand the general nature of the illness but cannot recognize that he has the illness. This means that the patient cannot appreciate the benefits of the treatment or the need for treatment.  Commentary  The majority may have accurately surmised from the following language of the Board: ‚Äúit viewed with great sadness the current situation of the patient [‚Ä¶] his life has been devastated by his mental disorder.‚Äù According to Daphne Jarvis, a legal counsel to the Schizophrenia Society of Canada, > \\"The [Supreme] Court did not change the Health Care Consent Act or even make > the process more difficult.\\"\\"Fighting for the right to refuse treatment: > Part 2\\" , The Ottawa Citizen, 11 June 2005.

Elrington was born in Farnborough, as the second of three sons of Brigadier Maxwell Elrington, and his wife Beryl. Christopher's father died in active service in Germany, while the son was 15. Elrington was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire, before performing his military service. He later went to University College, Oxford, where he took a BA. After this he did his MA in medieval history at Bedford College, University of London. In 1954 Elrington started working for the Victoria County History. The projectan attempt to build a comprehensive history of all the counties of Englandwas at this time in a phase of revival, after having been dormant since the time of the First World War. Initially he worked primarily on the history of Birmingham, as well as a history of the parish of Woodford in Wiltshire, that would serve as a model for the format that the new editions of the works would adopt. In 1960 work started on the county of Gloucestershire, and Elrington moved to the county to get closer to the sources. Over the course of eight years, he and his assistants completed two and a half volumes covering over sixty places, which was considered a good rate of work. In 1968 he returned to London, where he became deputy editor of the whole project. Then, in 1977, he was made general editor, succeeding Ralph Pugh, and remained in this post until 1994. As the coordinator of the work of over thirty professional historians, he had great influence on the work, and put greater emphasis on such things as the history of the landscape. Much of his effort was also focused on financing the project, which at the time was running into financial difficulties. From 1962 to 1972 he was the general editor of the Wiltshire Record Society, an honorary position. Elrington became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1964, and of the Royal Historical Society in 1969. The University of London gave him the title of professor in 1992, though he did not teach there. After he retired in 1994 he became an emeritus professor. While at Oxford he met and married Jean Margaret Buchanan, an architect. Together they had twins; a son and a daughter.

It is, within the Canadian system of honours, the fourth highest of the war and operational service medals. Design Designed by Bruce W. Beatty, the Somalia Medal is in the form of a diameter gold plated bronze medal with, on the obverse, three overlapping maple leaves between the word CANADA above (which the original design did not include) and two sprigs of laurel leaves below. On the reverse is the Royal Cypher of Queen Elizabeth II surmounted by a St. Edward's Crown symbolizing the sovereign's roles as both fount of honour and Commander-in- Chief of the Canadian Forces circumscribed by the words SOMALIA ‚Ä¢ 1992-93 ‚Ä¢ SOMALIE. This medallion is worn at the left chest, suspended on a 31.8mm wide ribbon coloured with vertical stripes with two in the shade of blue used by the United Nations flanking a series in white (representing peace), sand (recalling the physical features of the theatre of operations), light blue (representing the Air Command), scarlet (representing the Land Force Command), and dark blue (recalling the Maritime Command). Eligibility and allocation Though the Governor General-in-Council did not originally intend to issue a medal for the Somalia campaign, due to the so called scandal that had taken place there, on 8 April 1997, Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of her Cabinet under Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien, created the Somalia Medal to recognize members of the Canadian Forces who had served in the theatre of the Somali Civil War. To qualify for the medal, individuals had to have served for 90 days between 16 November 1992 and 30 June 1993 in Somalia, or within 200 kilometers of the Somali coast, as a part of the operation to stabilize the country and offer humanitarian aid. However, the requirements for the Somalia Medal were the first to specifically demand \\"honourable service\\", meaning that those members of the Canadian Airborne Regiment involved in the murder of a Somali thief who tried breaking into the Canadian base were not among the total 1,408 medals that were issued. The mission by Canada was referred to as Operation Deliverance, and there was only one tour there in Somalia. Unfortunately the one incident of the death of the Somali over shadowed all the heroic acts of bravery and good the Canadian soldiers achieved while on tour there .

The backlash from the Senate and others in military and right-wing political circles against G√≥mez and his department, stemmed from the ruling of the Office of the Inspector General against Army General Jes√∫s Armando Arias Cabrales and Army Colonel Edilberto S√°nchez Rubiano for their role during the 1985 Palace of Justice siege.

It serves students in grades 9 through 12. Its official school colors are maroon and gold. Its mascot is the \\"Pacer.\\" History CHS was the third high school in Chicopee. Until 1896, two smaller high schools served Chicopee and Chicopee Falls. These were replaced by Central High School which opened in 1890 and served as the only high school until it was destroyed by fire in January 1916. The Taylor School in Chicopee Falls served as a temporary high school until 1921. To be located at 650 Front Street, construction on a new Chicopee High School began in 1917 on land once occupied by the Assumption Church which itself had been destroyed by fire in 1912. Construction on the $1 million school was delayed by World War I, and CHS finally opened in September 1921. It was built in the collegiate style and faced with tapestry brick. Situated on a hill, its large front lawn featured the \\"keys of knowledge\\" outlined in shrubs. A small park and a memorial to Chicopee residents who died in World War I was constructed on an adjacent parcel. CHS featured an auditorium that seated 1000 people and the first gymnasium in any Chicopee school. The Chicopee Trade School occupied a wing of the new CHS. In 1957 a new gymnasium complex was added, featuring a basketball court and pool. The gym was later named after a former principal Henry B. Fay. The old gymnasium was converted into a cafeteria, the balcony of which was nicknamed \\"Baby Heaven\\" and was used for suspended students. Another location that earned an enduring nickname was \\"Cats Alley,\\" a windowless hallway on the second floor that ran between the gymnasium and the auditorium. With the Baby Boom, the student population of CHS swelled to over 3,000 students. Several temporary classrooms were constructed in the land behind the school and triple sessions had to be instituted. This severe overcrowding forced the city to construct a second high school. In 1962 the new Chicopee Comprehensive High School opened in the Aldenville section of town. As a vocational school, CCHS absorbed the functions of the old Chicopee Trade School Between 1975 and 1977 the aging high school underwent extensive renovations. These included a new library built above the auditorium and new classrooms built off \\"Cats Ally\\" above the old gymnasium. For two school years most students were relocated to schools at Westover Air Force Base and 9th graders to the old Michael J Kirby Junior High School. The athletic complex at Szot Park has been the location of many great athletic events. Huge crowds are attracted by CHS football games. A Thanksgiving game between CHS and Holyoke High School several years ago attracted over 10,000 people. The crowds at these athletic events are much smaller now, but occasionally reach 3,000 or more. The traditional rivalry between CHS and Holyoke on Thanksgiving are alternated. Odd years they play at CHS, and even years at Holyoke High. Many years ago, the Thanksgiving game was not held on Thanksgiving, but on Saturday afternoons. Groundbreaking for the new State-of-the-art Chicopee High School took place on the grounds of the old Chicopee Municipal Home on Front Street in the Spring of 2002. Completion was in early 2004. The new CHS officially opened to students August 31, 2004. Dedication ceremonies were held in September 2004. The new high school has four floors, a pre-kindergarten program, a gymnasium, library, band room, and video publications area. It hosts up to 3000 students.

Queen Viharamahadevi was the daughter of King Kelanitissa who ruled Kelaniya. The King once punished an innocent monk by boiling him alive in a cauldron of oil. It is said that the gods, angered over this cruel deed, made the ocean rush inland and flood the land. Soothsayers said that if a princess was sacrificed to the sea, the raging waves would stop. The young princess sacrificed herself for the sins of her father and for the safety of her motherland. She was placed inside a beautifully decorated boat which bore the letters Daughter of a King and set adrift on the sea. It is said that as soon as she was sent off, the sea suddenly turned calm again and the water receded. However, the King was very upset, the Queen was wailing and the citizens were very angry over the loss of their brave princess. They all started blaming the King. Meanwhile, the young princess finally reached the shore, at a spot known as Dovera in Kirinda, in the southern part of the country, then known as Rohana (now Ruhuna) which was a quite prosperous area ruled by King Kavantissa. A fisherman who first spotted the boat is said to have run to the castle, and informed the King about the castaway princess. The Thupavamsa says birds who first spotted the floating boat informed the King. The princess was brought before the King in a procession. The King, on hearing her story, was so impressed that he decided to marry the princess who had been so brave and patriotic to sacrifice her life for her country. As a part of the legend it's said as she reached the shore at a spot close to the Lanka Vihara, she was named Viharamahadevi. The place where she landed is marked with an inscription laid there by Prince Mahanaga. She bore the King two sons, Dutugemunu and Saddhatissa. The former is one of the greatest heroes of Sri Lanka, while Viharamahadevi herself is recognised as a great heroine of Sri Lanka.

The Seleucid military campaign against the Galatians took place between 269 BC-267 BC, during the reign of Antiochus I. Those who had assisted Antiochus I and Achaeus were taken prisoner and Achaeus paid for their ransom to be released. Antiochus I won this military campaign. Those who had Achaeus as their benefactor inscribed their benefaction on a stone stele and placed it in the sanctuary of Zeus at Babakome and that of Apollo at Kiddioukome. The descendants of those who were saved by Achaeus for all time were granted a seat of honor at the public festivals and sacrificed to Achaeus every year an ox in the sanctuary of Zeus. Achaeus married an unnamed Greek woman. From his wife, she had born him five children who were: *Antiochis, she married Attalus and became the mother of Attalus I, King of Pergamon.(Strab. xiii. p. 624.)Grainger, A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer p.47 *Alexander, held high positions under his paternal uncle Antiochus I Soter.Grainger, A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer p. 47 *Laodice I, she was the first wife of the Seleucid King Antiochus II Theos.

Trendle and Fran Striker that originated in a 1930s radio program and has appeared in movie serials, a television series, comic books and other media. Directed by Michel Gondry from a screenplay by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the film stars Rogen in the title role, Jay Chou, Christoph Waltz, Edward James Olmos, David Harbour, Tom Wilkinson and Cameron Diaz. The film was released to theaters in North America on January 14, 2011 by Columbia Pictures in both RealD Cinema and IMAX 3D formats. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $227.8 million against a $120 million production budget. Plot Britt Reid is the playboy son of James Reid, the publisher of the Los Angeles Daily Sentinel. They have an estranged relationship until James dies from an apparent allergic reaction to a bee sting. After James's funeral, Britt fires the staff aside from his maid, but later rehires Kato, a mechanic, martial artist and friend of James, as his assistant. Britt and Kato quickly become best friends and get drunk together. Upon agreeing that they both hated James, the two visit the graveyard to decapitate James's memorial statue. After they succeed, they rescue a nearby couple being mugged. When the police mistake Britt and Kato for criminals, Kato evades them in a car chase as he and Britt return to their mansion. Britt convinces Kato they should become superhero-like crime-fighters posing as criminals. Kato develops a car outfitted with several gadgets and weapons, which they call the Black Beauty. Britt plans to capture Benjamin Chudnofsky, a Russian mobster and gangster uniting the crime families of Los Angeles under his command, and whom his father was trying to expose. To get Chudnofsky's attention, Britt uses the Daily Sentinel as a vehicle to publish articles about a \\"high-profile criminal\\" he names \\"The Green Hornet.\\" Britt hires Lenore Case as his researcher, and uses her unwitting advice to raise the Green Hornet's profile. Britt and Kato blow up several of Chudnofsky's meth labs, leaving calling cards so Chudnofsky can contact them. Throughout all this, the Daily Sentinel's managing editor, Mike Axford, fears this single-minded coverage will endanger Britt's life, and District Attorney Frank Scanlon frets over public perception that he cannot stop the Green Hornet. Britt asks Lenore out for dinner, but she rebuffs him and instead invites Kato, making Britt confused and jealous. Kato learns from her that mobsters often offer a peace summit to rivals in order to get close enough to kill them; Britt then tells Kato that Chudnofsky has offered them such a meeting. Kato tries dissuading him, but Britt, feeling overshadowed, follows his instincts. This nearly proves fatal when Chudnofsky tries to kill them. Barely escaping to the mansion, Britt and Kato start arguing and the two get into a fight, causing Britt to angrily fire both Kato and Lenore, who he believes are in a relationship. Later, Kato receives an email from Chudnofsky on the Hornet's calling-card email address, offering $1 million and half of Los Angeles to the \\"Hornet\\" if he kills Britt. Meanwhile, Britt discovers that Scanlon is corrupt and that he tried to bribe James into downplaying the city's crime level to help his career. Chudnofsky, meanwhile, suffers a midlife crisis and renames himself as a supervillain known as \\"Bloodnofsky\\". Scanlon invites Britt to a meeting in a restaurant, where he reveals to Britt in his eye that he was responsible for the murder of his father as he is shown to be an ally of Chudnofsky. Chudnofsky arrives with his henchmen to kill Britt, but Kato appears and saves Britt before they escape. At the Daily Sentinel, Britt intends to upload a recording of Scanlon's confession onto the Web - which he belatedly discovers he did not manage to record. Chudnofsky and his men, who followed the duo there, engage them in a firefight, wounding Britt in the process. However, Kato ultimately impales Chudnofsky in the eyes with two large pieces of wood in self-defense before Britt guns him down. A SWAT team appears and fires at the Green Hornet and Kato, who use the remains of their nearly demolished Black Beauty to run Scanlon out of the building to his death. The Green Hornet and Kato flee to Lenore's house, where she learns their true identities and hides them from the police before trying to help by removing the bullet from Britt. The next morning, Britt promotes Axford to chief editor and lies about being shot by Kato, further establishing the Green Hornet as a vigilante and allowing Britt to get treated by professionals in a hospital. Later, Britt and Kato weld the head back onto James's statue. Now with Lenore on their side, the two decide to continue protecting Los Angeles by breaking the law while also fighting criminals and saving civilians at the same time.

(Requires subscription.) negotiations were ongoing with Universal Pictures. By September 1993, Chuck Pfarrer had finished the screenplay. Rich Wilkes was hired to rewrite Pfarrer's script, which resulted in George Clooney signing a pay-or-play contract. Clooney dropped out in December 1995 to star in Batman and Robin, and an anonymous source at Universal told Entertainment Weekly the following May that Greg Kinnear was being looked at for the title role. Jason Scott Lee by this time had signed on to co-star as Kato. Universal hired music video director Michel Gondry in January 1997 for his feature film directorial debut. Gondry rewrote the Wilkes screenplay with Edward Neumeier, saying that \\"after one-and-a-half years, it was shelved by the studio. ... We already had the designs for the cars, the weapons. .... WebCitation archive. Lawrence Gordon and Lloyd Levin had been signed on to produce by January 1997.. . Mark Wahlberg was offered the lead role,. (Requires subscription.) but the film languished in development hell and Gondry eventually left. In April 2000, Universal entered early negotiations with Jet Li to star as Kato for $5.2 million against 5% of the film's gross. Dark Horse Entertainment and Charles Gordon joined Larry Gordon and Lloyd Levin as producers.. (Requires subscription.) Christopher McQuarrie was writing a script by June 2000,. (Requires subscription.) but with it uncompleted by October, Li moved on to work on The One while remaining attached to The Green Hornet.. (Requires subscription.) After spending about $10 million in development since 1992, Universal put The Green Hornet in turnaround in November 2001, by which time Li and the producers were no longer involved. Paramount and Columbia Pictures showed interest in picking up Universal's option, but Miramax Films won the bidding that month with what Variety reported as \\"a deal approaching $3 million.\\". (Requires subscription.) In May 2003 the studio was working with automobile companies on product placement opportunities for the Black Beauty. As part of the deal, Miramax would receive its \\"hero car\\" and $35 million in additional marketing. The car company that would have landed the deal would be given the chance to help develop The Green Hornet, since a script had yet to be written and no director was attached to the planned 2005 release. Variety noted this figure would have tied the record $35 million deal between Ford Motor Company and MGM that featured the company's Aston Martin Vanquish, Jaguar XKR and Ford Thunderbird in the James Bond film Die Another Day.. (Requires subscription.) In February 2004, Miramax president Harvey Weinstein hired cult filmmaker and comic book writer Kevin Smith to write and direct the film, based on their previous four- film collaborations. \\"I dig the fact that he kicked off a run of billionaire playboys who decided to put on a mask and fight crime and that he was Batman before there was a Batman,\\" Smith said. \\"I always said I'd never do a superhero film, based on my limited experience writing on Superman Lives and having to answer to the studio, Jon Peters, the comics company and eventually a director. Then there's a fandom that gets up in arms if you even try to stray from their character. Here, there is simplicity in the character and the situation.\\". (Requires subscription.) Jon Gordon and Hannah Minghella were now on as producers, with Harold Berkowitz and George Trendle, son of the character's co-creator, as executive producers. Smith approached Jake Gyllenhaal for the lead role in March 2004. In mid-November of that year, Smith said he had written about 100 pages, and estimated another 100 to come. In February 2006, Smith's official website noted, \\"Kevin officially no longer has anything to do with the Fletch or Green Hornet projects.\\" Smith went on to write the Dynamite Entertainment comic book Green Hornet, which has run 11 issues as of late 2010. In March 2007, producer Neal H. Moritz, who had been trying to acquire the film rights to the character for years, obtained the rights and through his Sony-based production company Original Film optioned them to Columbia Pictures. In July 2007 Seth Rogen, in addition to starring in the lead role, was hired to co-write the script with frequent collaborator Evan Goldberg and named as an executive producer for The Green Hornet. Rogen in July 2007 said he had not begun writing the screenplay yet, but anticipated the tone would be that of \\"a buddy action movie\\" with humor, \\"like Lethal Weapon and 48 Hrs.. In September 2008, Columbia Pictures announced a June 25, 2010, release date, and that Hong Kong star Stephen Chow had signed to direct and to co-star as Kato. Chow, a fan of the TV show as a kid, explained, \\"The idea of stepping into Bruce Lee's shoes as Kato is both humbling and thrilling, and to get the chance to direct the project as my American movie debut is simply a dream come true.\\" (Requires subscription.) Chow dropped out as director the following December over creative differences.. WebCitation archive. On February 24, 2009, Columbia Pictures announced that Michel Gondry would direct the film, on which Chow had remained as Kato,. after impressing Columbia production presidents Doug Belgrad and Matt Tolmach with his pitch. (Requires subscription.) Gondry had previously been involved with The Green Hornet when Universal Pictures was planning its version in 1997. Chow dropped out as Kato in July 2009 over scheduling conflicts with other projects. (Requires subscription.) By this time the release date had been pushed to July 9, 2010. In August, he was replaced with Taiwanese singer-actor Jay Chou.. . The studio was then in early talks with Nicolas Cage to play the gangster villain, and Cameron Diaz was negotiating to play researcher and love interest Lenore Case. The principal production began on September 2, 2009 Casting Nicolas Cage had been in talks to play the role of Benjamin Chudnofsky, saying in 2009, \\"The Green Hornet was something I wanted to do. I think Michel Gondry is very talented and I had hoped it would work. But I think Seth Rogen and Michel had a different direction for the character totally than the way I wanted to go. ... I wasn't interested in just being straight-up bad guy who was killing people willy-nilly. I had to have some humanity and try to give it something where you could understand why the character was the way he was. But there wasn't enough time to develop it.\\". . The filmmakers had wanted Van Williams, who played the Green Hornet in the 1960s television series, to make a cameo appearance as a cemetery guard, but Williams turned the part down.Marshall, Rick. \\"Michel Gondry Talks 'Green Hornet' Legacy, No Cameo For Van Williams\\", MTV News, March 22, 2010. WebCitation archive. Locations Producer Neal H. Moritz considered filming The Green Hornet in Michigan, New York and Louisiana, but ultimately chose Los Angeles, California as the primary location shooting. \\"Ultimately, we made the decision, and thankfully the studio agreed with us, that the creative positives of shooting in Los Angeles outweighed the tax incentives offered to us elsewhere,\\" Moritz said. Principal photography began at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California on September 2, 2009, for one week. Filming then moved to Chinatown, Los Angeles, for scenes featuring Kato's apartment. Through November, other locations included Sun Valley, Holmby Hills (specifically Fleur de Lys, which played the part of the Reid mansion), Bel-Air, Hawthorne and various locations downtown, including City Hall and the Los Angeles Times Building.. Props A Black Beauty Imperial used in the film The production modified 29 Imperial Crown sedans from model years 1964 to 1966 to portray the Green Hornet's luxurious supercar, the Black Beauty. Twenty-six of those cars were wrecked during production and three survived in pristine condition.

Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave it 3 stars out of 5, and commented that the \\"irreverently funny\\" film had \\"a vibe so casual you half expect star Seth Rogen to amble off screen and put his feet up on the seat next to you,\\" and praising director Gondry's \\"sense of humor and acute visual skill\\" even while calling the movie \\"cheerfully unfocused\\".Weitzman, Elizabeth. \\"The Green Hornet\\" (review), Daily News, January 14, 2011 Despite the criticism, Paste ranked The Green Hornet as the 88th greatest superhero movie.

Future Cancelled sequel Producer Neil Moritz said in March 2012 that no sequel would be forthcoming since the movie \\"did almost $250 million and was actually very well liked, but we made the movie for too much money. One, we made it in L.A. for certain reasons, and two, we decided to go to 3D‚Äîthat added another $10 million. If I had done it in a tax-rebate state and not done 3D, it would have been considered a huge financial success for the studio. So we're not making a sequel right now.\\" Reboot In 2016, Paramount Pictures and Chernin Entertainment acquired the film rights to the Green Hornet, with developments for a rebooted adaptation. Gavin O'Connor signed on to produce and direct, while Sean O'Keefe will be the screenwriter. In 2020, Universal Pictures and Amasia Entertainment announced they were partnering on The Green Hornet and Kato and are in development on a film based on the classic characters.

It details the Taliban movement's origins in Pashtun nationalism, and briefly relates its ideological underpinnings with that of broader Afghan society. It details the Taliban's consolidation of power, listing persecutions by the Taliban officials during its five years in power in Afghanistan and during its war with the Northern Alliance. Contact with Pakistan's ISI During the power vacuum created by the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, the country was torn apart by warring mujahideen groups and the ISI of Pakistan grasped the chance to wield power in the region by fostering a previously unknown Kandahari student movement. They continued to support the Taliban, as Pakistani allies, in their push to conquer Afghanistan in the 1990s. The Taliban were based in the Helmand, Kandahar, and Uruzgan regions and were overwhelmingly ethnic Pashtuns and predominantly Durrani Pashtuns.Rashid, Taliban (2000), p.98 Taliban initially enjoyed enormous good will from Afghans weary of the corruption, brutality, and the incessant fighting of Mujahideen warlords.Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim world / editor in chief, Richard C. Martin, Macmillan Reference USA : Thomson/Gale, c2004 One story is that the rape and murder of boys and girls from a family traveling to Kandahar or a similar outrage by Mujahideen bandits sparked Mohammed Omar (Mullah Omar) and his students to vow to rid Afghanistan of these criminals.Matinuddin, Kamal, The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994-1997, Oxford University Press, (1999), pp.25‚Äì6 Another motivation was that the Pakistan-based truck shipping mafia known as the \\"Afghanistan Transit Trade\\" and their allies in the Pakistan government, trained, armed, and financed the Taliban to clear the southern road across Afghanistan to the Central Asian Republics of extortionate bandit gangs.Rashid, Taliban (2000), 25-29. Many senior leaders of the Afghanistan Taliban were closely associated with and had attended the Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary in Akora Khattak in Pakistan, including Mullah Omar, and its role in supporting the Taliban., Imtiaz Ali, Spotlight on Terror, The Jamestown Foundation, Volume 4, Issue 2, May 23, 2007The 'university of holy war', Haroon Rashid, BBC Online, 2 October 2003 The seminary is run by Maulana Sami ul Haq of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam who is often referred to as the \\"Father of the Taliban\\".Inside Islam's \\"terror schools\\", William Dalrymple, New Statesman, 28 March 2005 Allegations of connection to 'The West' or to the United States (CIA) After the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in 1979, Islamic mujahideen fighters engaged in war with those Soviet forces. Some of those Islamic fighters would later transform into the Taliban according to Professor Carole Hillenbrand who stated: \\"The West helped the Taliban to fight the Soviet takeover of Afghanistan\\". Although no documentation has officially surfaced that the CIA directly supported the Taliban or Al Qaeda, some basis for military support of the Taliban was provided when, in the early 1980s, the CIA and the ISI (Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency) provided arms to Afghans resisting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the ISI assisted the process of gathering radical Muslims from around the world to fight against the Soviets. Osama bin Laden was one of the key players in organizing training camps for the foreign Arab volunteers, although his organization, Maktab al- Khidamat, was exclusively Saudi funded. Ahmed Rashid states that the US indirectly supported the Taliban through its ally in Pakistan between 1994 and 1996 because Washington viewed the Taliban as anti-Iranian, anti-Shia and pro- Western. For example, it made no comment when the Taliban captured Herat in 1995, and expelled thousands of girls from schools. At this early stage, the then Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, Robin Raphel, strongly supported efforts to engage with the Taliban. She also supported a Unocal-led, Taliban-supported pipeline project on trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan in April and August 1996. She was one of the first senior American officials to meet personally with Taliban, including its leader, Mohammed Omar. She called on the international community to \\"engage the Taliban.\\" Raphel was instrumental in coordinating the State Department's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Taliban shortly after its takeover of Kabul. She welcomed their taking of Kabul in September 1996 as a \\"positive step\\". Her consistent support for the Taliban from its earliest days earned her the sobriquet \\"Lady Taliban\\" and \\"Godmother to the Taliban\\" in some circles. In late 1997, American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright began to distance the US from the Taliban, and Unocal withdrew from negotiations on pipeline construction from Central Asia. Emergence in Afghanistan The first major military activity of the Taliban was in October‚ÄìNovember 1994 when they marched from Maiwand in southern Afghanistan to capture Kandahar City and the surrounding provinces, losing only a few dozen men.Rashid, Taliban, (2000) pp.27‚Äì9 Starting with the capture of a border crossing and a huge ammunition dump from warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a few weeks later they freed \\"a convoy trying to open a trade route from Pakistan to Central Asia\\" from another group of warlords attempting to extort money. In the next three months this hitherto \\"unknown force\\" took control of twelve of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, with Mujahideen warlords often surrendering to them without a fight and the \\"heavily armed population\\" giving up their weapons.Rashid, Taliban (2000), p.1 By September 1996 they had captured Afghanistan's capital, Kabul. Taliban emergence also started with two local commanders of the then government raped a girl. Taliban found the commanders and hung them as their punishment. Consolidation of power Under the Taliban regime, Sharia law was interpreted to ban a wide variety of activities hitherto lawful in Afghanistan: employment, education and sports for women, movies, television, videos, music, dancing, hanging pictures in homes, clapping during sports events, kite flying, and beard trimming. One Taliban list of prohibitions included: > pork, pig, pig oil, anything made from human hair, satellite dishes, > cinematography, and equipment that produces the joy of music, pool tables, > chess, masks, alcohol, tapes, computers, VCRs, television, anything that > propagates sex and is full of music, wine, lobster, nail polish, > firecrackers, statues, sewing catalogs, pictures, Christmas cards.Amy > Waldman, \`No TV, no Chess, No Kites: Taliban's Code, from A to Z,\` New York > Times, 22 November 2001 Men were required to have a beard extending farther than a fist clamped at the base of the chin. On the other hand, they had to wear their head hair short. Men were also required to wear a head covering. Possession was forbidden of depictions of living things, whether drawings, paintings or photographs, stuffed animals, and dolls. These rules were issued by the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Suppression of Vice (PVSV) and enforced by its \\"religious police,\\" a concept thought to be borrowed from the Wahhabis. In newly conquered towns hundreds of religious police beat offenders (typically men without beards and women who were not wearing their burqas properly) with long sticks.Rashid, Taliban (2000), p.105 Theft was punished by the amputation of a hand, rape and murder by public execution. Married adulterers were stoned to death. In Kabul, punishments were carried out in front of crowds in the city's former soccer stadium. Treatment of women religious police beating a woman in Kabul on 13 September 2001. The footage, which was filmed by RAWA. Women in particular were targets of the Taliban's restrictions. They were prohibited from working; from wearing clothing regarded as \\"stimulating and attractive,\\" including the \\"Iranian chador,\\" (viewed as insufficiently complete in its covering); from taking a taxi without a \\"close male relative\\" (mahram); washing clothes in streams; or having their measurements taken by tailors.Rashid, Taliban (2000), pp.218‚Äì9. See the full edict here: The Taliban In Their Own Words Employment of women was restricted to the medical sector because male medical personnel were not allowed to examine women. One result of the Taliban's ban on employment of women was the closing down of many primary schools, in places such as Kabul, not only for girls but for boys too, because almost all the teachers there were women.Rashid, Taliban (2000), p.106 Women were also not permitted to attend co-educational schools; in practice, this prevented the vast majority of young women and girls in Afghanistan from receiving even a primary education. Women were made to wear the burqa, a traditional dress covering the entire body, with a small screen covering the face through which the wearer could see. Taliban restrictions became more severe after they took control of the capital. In February 1998, religious police forced all women off the streets of Kabul and issued new regulations ordering \\"householders to blacken their windows, so women would not be visible from the outside.\\"Rashid, Taliban (2000) p.70 Home schools for girls, which had been allowed to continue, were forbidden.Rashid, Taliban (2000), p.114 In June 1998, the Taliban stopped all women from attending general hospitals,Rashid, Taliban (2000), p.71. leaving the use of one all-women hospital in Kabul. There were many reports of Muslim women being beaten by the Taliban for violating the Taliban interpretation of the Sharia.  Prohibitions on culture  Movie theaters were closed and music was banned. Hundreds of cultural artifacts that were deemed polytheistic were also destroyed including a major museum and countless private art collections.Wright, Looming Towers (2006), p.231 A sample Taliban edict issued after their capture of Kabul is one decreed in December 1996 by the \\"General Presidency of Amr Bil Maruf and Nahi Anil Munkar\\" (or Religious Police) banning a variety of things and activities: music, shaving of beards, keeping of pigeons, flying kites, displaying of pictures or portraits, western hairstyles, music and dancing at weddings, gambling, \\"sorcery,\\" and not praying at prayer times. In February 2001, Taliban used sledgehammers to destroy representational works of art at the National Museum of Afghanistan.Wright, Looming Towers (2006), p.337. Local festivities were not exempt from prohibitions. The Taliban banned the traditional Afghan New Year's celebrations and \\"for a time they also banned [Ashura] the Shia Islamic month of mourning and even restricted any show of festivity at Eid.\\"Rashid, Taliban, (2000), pp.115‚Äì116. The Afghan people were not allowed to have any cultural celebrations if women were present. If there were only men at the celebration it would be allowed, so long as it ended by 7:00 p.m, a set time. Many Taliban officials were slightly opposed to the idea of no entertainment, but even they wanted it to follow many of the religious restrictions. Buddhas of Bamiyan In March 2001, the Taliban ordered the demolition of two statues of Buddhas carved into cliffsides at Bamiyan, one 38 metres (125 ft) tall and carved in 507 CE, the other 53 metres (174 ft) tall and carved in 554 CE. The act was condemned by UNESCO and many countries around the world. The intentions of the destruction remain unclear. Mullah Omar initially supported the preservation of Afghanistan's heritage, and Japan linked financial aid to the preservation of the statues. However, after a few years, a decree was issued claiming all representations of humans and idols, including those in museums, must be destroyed in accordance with Islamic law which prohibits any form of idol worship. The government of Pakistan (itself host to one of the richest and most ancient collections of Buddhist art) implored the Taliban to spare the statues. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates later denounced the act as savage. Sayed Rahmatullah Hashemi, a senior representative of the Taliban designated as the roving Ambassador, visited the US in March, 2001. He portrayed the Taliban's action not as an act of irrationality, but as an act of rage over UNESCO and some western governments denying the Taliban use of the funds meant for the repairs of the war-damaged statues of the Buddha. He contended that the Taliban intended to use the money for drought relief.Transcript However, the Taliban spent much money and effort on destroying the statues, resources which they could have instead used for drought relief. Ethnic massacres and persecution The worst attack on civilians came in summer of 1998 when the Taliban swept north from Herat to the predominantly Hazara and Uzbek city of Mazar-i-Sharif, the largest city in the north. Entering at 10 am on 8 August 1998, for the next two days the Taliban drove their pickup trucks \\"up and down the narrow streets of Mazar-i- Sharif shooting to the left and right and killing everything that moved ‚Äî shop owners, cart pullers, women and children shoppers and even goats and donkeys.\\"Rashid, Taliban (2000), p.73. More than 8000 noncombatants were reported killed in Mazar-i-Sharif and later in Bamiyan.Goodson, Afghanistan's Endless War, (2001), p.79. Contrary to the injunctions of Islam, which demands immediate burial, the Taliban forbade anyone to bury the corpses for the first six days while they rotted in the summer heat and were eaten by dogs.THE MASSACRE IN MAZAR-I SHARIF, THE FIRST DAY OF THE TAKEOVER. In addition to this indiscriminate slaughter, the Taliban sought out and massacred members of the Hazara, a mostly Shia ethnic group, while in control of Mazar-i-Sharif. While the slaughter can be attributed to several factors ‚Äì ethnic difference, suspicion of Hazara loyalty to their co-religionists in Iran, fury at the loss of life suffered in an earlier unsuccessful Taliban takeover of Mazar ‚Äì the belief by some Sunni Taliban that the Shia Hazaras were guilty of takfir (apostasy) may have been the principal motivation. It was expressed by Mullah Niazi, the commander of the attack and governor of Mazar after the attack, in his declaration from Mazar's central mosque: > Last year you rebelled against us and killed us. From all your homes you > shot at us. Now we are here to deal with you. The Hazaras are not Muslims > and now we have to kill Hazaras. You either accept to be Muslims or leave > Afghanistan. Wherever you go we will catch you. If you go up we will pull > you down by your feet; if you hide below, we will pull you up by your hair. Hazara also suffered a siege by the Taliban of their Hazarajat homeland in central Afghanistan and the refusal by the Taliban to allow the UN to supply food to Hazara in the provinces of Bamiyan, Ghor, Wardak and Ghazni.Rashid, Taliban (2000), p.68 A month after the Mazar slaughter, Taliban broke through Hazar lines and took over Hazarajat. The number of civilians killed was not as great as in Mazar, but occurred nevertheless.Rashid, Taliban (2000), p.76. During the years that followed, massacres of Hazara by Taliban forces were documented by groups such as Human Rights Watch. Conscription According to the testimony of Guantanamo captives before their Combatant Status Review Tribunals, the Taliban, in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers, also conscripted men to staff its civil service.

In 2000, nine of his poems were printed in the Alsop Review, an online poetry magazine in the United States. In 1965, List became a co-editor (with his flatmates Blair Peach and David Rutherford) of the Argot magazine, which had a leading role as an experimental literary magazine. He later edited and largely wrote the first two New Zealand Whole Earth Catalogues. In 1979, List and his family migrated to Australia, where he became head of market research for the ABC, operating out of Adelaide. He took redundancy from the ABC in 1998 and became a freelance marketing guru, making several trips to Southeast Asia and Africa for the Swedish Aid organisation and published major marketing guides. He took up a South Australian government scholarship to do a PhD at the University of South Australia, which he completed in 2006. He was made head of the market research department at Adelaide University, having already established an international reputation in Futures Studies. In the latter part of his life, List worked on a dozen novels, six completed.

Description Tradition dictates that a \\"Brigadier\\" take care of every aspect of the meal; each week a different member holds the office of Brigadier. At the end of each meeting, an assessment is made of the quality of the meal. These meetings are exclusive to the members, but two events per year are open to friends and spouses, the Spring Dinner and the Ceremony for the General Assembly. Every year, the Club des Cent crowns two chefs and offers them a certificate, considered quite prestigious in the world of gastronomy. Once a year, the members of the Club are given a ranking. Membership Joining this highly confidential and qualitative club is complicated. Candidates can theoretically be of either gender, but no woman has ever been a member.

Sinking  On May 26, 1923, Life-Line was being taken north from Coos Bay to Kelso, Washington, under command of Captain Lund who was operating the vessel with a deckhand. Life-Line foundered off the coast, just south of Neahkahnie, and Captain Lund and the deckhand swam to shore. The vessel washed ashore and was later covered by the sand, where it was forgotten until 1949, when a bulldozer uncovered the wreck.

It is just east of Horse Ridge and approximately east of Bend and is part of the Bend, Oregon Metropolitan Statistical Area. Its elevation is above sea level. As of August 2011, the population is four. History In the late 1880s, George Millican established a ranch in the area. Millican's wife suggested that the town be named after him, and Millican post office was established in 1913. George Millican sold his ranch in 1916. In the early 20th century Millican's population was 60. In 1930, U.S. 20 was built north of the community, so Millican was moved to be next to the highway. By this time, the town's population was one‚Äîthe postmaster, Billy Rahn, who lived there from about 1922 to 1945. When Rahn retired in 1942, the post office was closed. In 1946, Bill Mellin bought Millican and ran the gas station, store and post office. The post office closed for good in 1953, but the store and gas station remained open for 35 more years. In 1985, Mellin put the community up for sale. In 1988, Mellin was robbed and murdered by a parolee from the Oregon State Penitentiary who worked for him in the store, making the town's population zero. Mellin's wife and two children had died before him, the children in a car accident and a plane crash, and his wife, Helen, of a heart attack. Mellin's granddaughter took over the store for a few years. Later Eric Cooper bought Mellin's estate. In 1999, Bruce and Tracy Resnick bought Millican with plans to donate the land to the Animal Rescue League, but they put the town up for sale in 2000. The Murray family moved to Millican in 2002, bringing the town's population up to seven. The Murrays rented the townsite and ran the store. The Millican Store closed again in 2005 when the Murrays moved on to run the cafe and gas station in Hampton, Oregon, further east. In February 2009, the on which Millican is located was for sale by the Resnicks, and had been since August 2008. The townsite and store were purchased in the spring of 2010 and a caretaker now lives on site.

The mainstream film journal Kinema Junpo included it in their choices for best ten films of the year of 1973. Synopsis In 1918, against the background of political events following the Russo-Japanese War, a geisha serves a new customer. Though he is about to be married, and it is against the rules, she falls in love with him. Cast * Junko Miyashita: Sodeko * Naomi ≈åka: Yuko * Hideaki Ezumi: Shinsuke * Hatsuo Yamaya: Pinsuke * Go Awazu: Koichi * Moeko Ezawa: Hanae * Meika Seri: Hanamuru Critical reception The World of Geisha was very successful with the public and critics in Japan. The mainstream film journal Kinema Junpo selected it as the 6th best Japanese film of 1973. In Currents in Japanese Cinema, Japanese film critic Tadao Sato describes the film as a \\"masterful porno film rich in emotion, anarchy, and nihilism.\\" Director Nagisa Oshima took an opposite view of the film in a well- known essay written before his own In the Realm of the Senses (1976). Oshima called Kumashiro's film \\"a little too refined,\\" and took it to task for failing to \\"realise the effect of pornography.\\" Oshima complained about the Roman porno films that they took \\"sex as their subject matter and not as their theme. The themes of their most highly regarded films tend to be something like adolescent rebellion; sex is merely the seasoning.\\" He concludes, this \\"is precisely why these films are attractive to superficial critics, and young film buffs.\\" Contemporary Western critics were also positive towards the film. A January 1974 Variety review noted that Kumashiro showed a \\"definitely savvy directorial flair\\", but that there was \\"(n)othing banal, or pretentious\\" about the film. Further, the \\"love scenes... are handled with wit and insight\\", and the \\"sex bouts... all have a rightness in tone.\\" The review continues, \\"It is technically fine and ranks with some well-known costumers.\\" \\"Right placement,\\" Variety concludes, \\"could have this gaining some following abroad and not for its sex scenes but its feeling for period, time and mores and social outlooks that are reflected from the sensual rather than the social side of its characters.\\"Mosk. Yojohan Fusuma No Shitabari (film review). Variety, 1974-01-02. Fran√ßois Truffaut called The World of Geisha a \\"great movie,\\" adding, \\"The acting is perfect, and the film is humorous. In its praise for female beauty and derision for male stupidity lies the generous spirit of Jean Renoir.\\" Later commentators on Japanese cinema continue to hold the film in high esteem. The Weissers, in their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films (1998) comment, \\"The structure of the film is its most interesting aspect. Director Kumashiro is playing intentional games with linear storytelling, creating a narrative which flows unhampered, unrestricted by time.\\" In his Behind the Pink Curtain, Jasper Sharp calls The World of Geisha Kumashiro's \\"most articulate attack\\" against censorship and state-imposed morality.Sharp, p. 138.  Themes and style  Kumashiro's screenplay was based on Kaf≈´ Nagai's Yojohan Fusuma No Shitabari, one of several erotic novels the author circulated underground after having been censored by the government in 1907. Kumashiro uses his simple, but complexly told, story to make a comment against censorship and militarism. One characteristic of Kumashiro's cinematic style which is present in The World of Geisha is the avoidance of sync sound through the use of titles. Titles can be used ironically in the film, as when the geisha house rules are presented, \\"No.1: Don't fall for your first client\\", while Sodeko can be seen obviously breaking that rule. Cutaways are another technique Kumashiro uses prominently in The World of Geisha. Most reviews of the film comment on the opening love-making session which lasts over one-third of the film's total running time. This long scene is intercut with subplots involving the other geishas and their clients.Johnson, pp. 3‚Äì4. Kumashiro's usage of inserts contrasts with that of traditional directors such as Ozu. Inserts in an Ozu film have a calming and transitional purpose, whereas Kumashiro uses them to shock the audience while also, in The World of Geisha, providing historical context. Historical events used as inserts in The World of Geisha include the Korean uprisings, Russia's October Revolution, the Japanese Rice Riots of 1918, and a police order censoring the news of these riots. Tadao Sato notes that the lead male character in the film, who has been raised in a brothel and is accustomed to the company of prostitutes, is a variation on the traditional nanpa character: an irresponsible type dedicated to sensual pleasures rather than hard work. Kumashiro, according to Sat≈ç, makes his characters sympathetic through their devotion to sensual pleasure.Sat≈ç, p. 244‚Äì245. Kumashiro often used Eirin's form of censoring visual depictions of genitals ‚Äì fogging ‚Äì against itself in an exaggerated form, as satirical commentary. In The World of Geisha, he does this while also \\"censoring\\" titles, such as Sodeko's, \\"I'm coming again!!\\", which is marked out with \\"X\\"s, as were reports of Japanese casualties in Siberia in the Russian Civil War. By using these two forms of censorship in juxtaposition, Kumashiro draws a parallel between Taish≈ç period censorship, and Eirin's, and the government's contemporary forms of censorship. Availability The World of Geisha was released theatrically in Japan on November 3, 1973. Nikkatsu marketed the film to the English-speaking world with the ad, \\"The essence of the geisha world! The art of pleasing men! ...dainty butterflies... and how these colorful beauties entertain their diverse guests night after night to the strains of the three-stringed samisen.\\" The World of Geisha was re-released on DVD in Japan on December 22, 2006, as part of Geneon's sixth wave of Nikkatsu Roman porno series. In the U.S., The World of Geisha has been released on home video by both Image Entertainment and Kino. Bibliography English  Mosk. Yojohan Fusuma No Shitabari (film review).

Gerstl, who was Jewish, was born in Vienna, where her father worked as a dentist. Biography She survived the war years by hiding in various locations with her motherat one point she had to hide in a wardrobeand thereby avoided being sent off to a concentration camp. After the war she started studying medicine and psychology at Vienna University, but ended her studies after the birth of her daughter. During the 1950s she became more and more involved in writing, and published her first work in the journal Neue Wege (New Ways) in 1955. Her first published book was Gesellschaftsspiele mit mir (Party games with me), a collection of poems and short prose that came out in 1962. In 1963 Gerstl moved to West-Berlin, where she received a scholarship from the Literarisches Colloquium Berlin. While living in Berlin, in 1968-69, she wrote the novel Spielr√§ume (Room to Manoeuvre), which was not published until 1977. She remained in Berlin until 1972, when she returned to Vienna. Gerstl's work spanned several different genres, including poems, essays and short stories. She was a devoted feminist, and much of her writing examines the subject of gender roles. In 1999 she received the Erich Fried Prize, as well as the Georg Trakl Poetry Award. On her death in 2009, Austrian minister of culture Claudia Schmied said that German-language literature had lost an important contributor. Gerstl's lifelong friend and college Elfriede Jelinek commented that, in spite of the tragic experiences of her life, Gerstl had always had the ability to write in a light and witty tone. Gerstl married author and radio editor Gerald Bisinger in 1960, with whom she had one daughter.  Works   Collected works  * Band 1: Mittellange Minis.

Founded in 2003, Suminter's mission is to give small-scale Indian farmers access to a global $52bn marketplace for certified organic products. In 2016, Suminter was working with over 20,000 farmers in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala, Uttarakhand, and Rajasthan, covering of land under organic cultivation. The company focuses on two product lines: non-perishable organic food and organic cotton.  History  After completing his undergraduate studies overseas, Sameer Mehra returned to India in 1998 with the idea of organic contract farming. There was a growing global demand for organic produce and India had unique advantages that made it a natural choice for cultivating these products: tropical weather and varied landscape ensure agro-climatic diversity and a broad range of crops year-round. Due to the high costs as well as local traditions, fertilizers and pesticides have low penetration throughout much of India. With a US$23 billion global market for organic foods in 2002 alone and a huge shortage of supply, Mehra saw an opportunity to supply organic food from India. In 2003, Mehra founded Suminter India Organics. The company focused its product lines on non- perishable goods and organic cotton largely because spices, grains, and cotton were Indian specialties, and also because they required less intensive supply- chain management as compared to fresh produce. In order to meet global demand, Suminter integrated international organic certification into its operating model to create a \\"farm to shelf\\" fully integrated supply chain. Though this added a 2-3 year gap between sourcing farms and organic procurement, Mehra eventually persuaded small-scale farmers of the long-term value of organic farming. Working with local NGOs, Suminter ensured consistent crop yields, safe farming practices, and a constant demand for produce. Moreover, the company passed on the benefit of higher organic margins, paying farmers a 10-20% premium over conventional products. Suminter has raised its first round of venture capital funding from Nexus India Capital in 2007. Suminter India Organics has been part of the Endeavor (non-profit) network since 2009.

A popular viewpoint atop the cliffs is accessed by a forest drive. The escarpment is formed from two distinct bands of Carboniferous limestone: the Glencar Limestone Formation and the overlying Dartry Limestone Formation. These overlie a series of mudrocks known as the Benbulben Shale Formation. Under the cliffs lie a mostly continuous apron of scree and landslipped material. The cliffs are a proposed Area of Special Scientific Interest. They are home to the Irish Rock-bristle (Seligeria oelandica), a black moss found on wet calcareous rocks and known only from this site in the whole of the United Kingdom, though found elsewhere in the Republic of Ireland.

After two years playing reserve team football for Newcastle, he joined Coventry City of the Southern League in the summer of 1911. On 13 January 1912, Turnbull scored the opening goal in a 2‚Äì0 FA Cup victory at Southampton (with the other from Harry Parkes), although Coventry went out in the next round, losing 5‚Äì1 to Manchester United. In the summer of 1912, Coventry City's trainer, Jimmy McIntyre, moved to Southern League rivals, Southampton as trainer under secretary Ernest Arnfield. In October, with the \\"Saints\\" only winning one of their first eight matches, McIntyre returned to Coventry to sign Turnbull in an effort to improve the team's goal-scoring. Turnbull made his debut on 19 October, replacing Fred Taylor at home to Brighton & Hove Albion; although he scored on his debut, the match ended 5‚Äì2 in favour of Brighton. Despite scoring only one further league goal, Turnbull retained his place in the team for the remainder of the season, other than a spell out injured in January/February when he was replaced by Archie Small.

At the age of 26 he lost both arms in a coal mine accident. He became a novelist, writing with a pen held by his teeth, and produced several novels, the most famous being Defying death ().  Life and accident  Titov was born into a wheat farmer's family in Voronezh Oblast. After serving in the Soviet Army, he completed a course at the College of Mines in Voroshilovgrad and started working at one of the new coal mines of Donets Basin. In 1960 he became involved in a serious accident. A loaded coal carriage derailed, hit a high-voltage cable, and short-circuited it. The resulting fire ran along the cable to the power transformer and would have caused an explosion, burying alive the entire shift of miners. Hoping to save his co-workers, Titov rushed to the transformer and managed to shut it down, but by doing so he exposed himself to high voltage. Doctors saved his life and an injured leg, but both his arms had to be amputated up to the shoulders. After a long recovery period, Titov became a writer, scribbling on paper with a pen held by his teeth.  Writing career  Titov's first novel, Defying Death, is autobiographical in nature and focuses on the mental problems a healthy young man develops after a serious accident. Physical pain, an inability to find employment, and the sense of being a burden to people put him on the verge of suicide. He manages not only to recover his mental balance but also begins to help others cope with their psychological problems. Defying Death was published in 1967 in the literary periodical Youth rather than as a separate book. This was a common practice at the time in the Soviet Union, especially for new writers. The novel quickly became popular. During the years following its publication, Titov received about 50,000 letters from disabled people asking for advice. The novel was included in the list of essential literature for secondary education and translated into 28 languages. Titov wrote the novels Feather Grass Growth in Steppe (, 1971), Partition (, 1973), and Drift Miners (, 1982), in addition to a number of short stories. His last completed novel was Old Park's Dreams (), which was published by his wife after his death at the age of 53. He left an uncompleted novel entitled Rye ().

It is more commonly seen in Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador. Uses The kernels of purple corn are soaked in hot water by people of the Andes to yield a deep purple color for foods and beverages, a practice now recognized for its industrial uses as a colorant. Common in Peru, purple corn is used in chicha morada, a drink made by boiling ground purple corn kernels with pineapple, cinnamon, clove, and sugar, and in mazamorra, a type of pudding. One of the most popular purple corn food uses is the \\"Api\\", a smoothie served hot and sometimes called \\"Inca's dessert\\". Color chemistry: anthocyanins The pigment giving purple corn its vivid color derives from an exceptional content of a class of polyphenols called anthocyanins. Cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, also called chrysanthemin, is the major anthocyanin in purple corn kernels, comprising about 73% of all anthocyanins present. Other anthocyanins identified are pelargonidin 3-O-Œ≤-D-glucoside, peonidin 3-O-Œ≤-D-glucoside, cyanidin 3-O-Œ≤-D-(6-malonyl-glucoside), pelargonidin 3-O-Œ≤-D-(6-malonyl-glucoside) and peonidin 3-O-Œ≤-D-(6-malonyl-glucoside). Similar results for anthocyanin content were found from a variety of purple corn grown in China. Evaluating growing conditions for anthocyanin and total polyphenol content, one research group found that field location was an important determinant, whereas seedling density and soil potassium content were not. For ease of extractions, scientists have explored components of the purple corn plant for yield, such as kernels, cob and husk, possibly allowing use of a plentiful, non-edible residual biomass in cobs or husks. Husks of the purple corn plant contain about ten times higher content of anthocyanins than do kernels.

Pelinna (Œ†Œ≠ŒªŒπŒΩŒΩŒ±) or Pelinnaeum ()so in Scylax and Pindar, P. 10.4.Arrian, Anabasis, 1.7. was an ancient Greek polis (city-state) of Ancient Thessaly, in the district Histiaeotis, a little above the left bank of the Peneius. The city had a celebrated temple of Zeus Pelinnaeus. Pelinna was situated between Tricca and Pharcadon, near modern Palaiogardiki (Trikala regional unit). The city gained particular prominence in the fourth century BCE through its alliance with Philip II of Macedon.S. Miller, Two Groups of Thessalian Gold Page 25 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979) Among other archaeological evidence of the religious significance of Pelinna are two Orphic gold tablets (lamellae) found in 1985 on the site of Petroporos,Instructions for the netherworld: the Orphic gold tablets By Alberto Bernab√©, Alberto Bernab√© Pajares, Ana Isabel Jim√©nez San Crist√≥bal Page 61 dating to the late fourth century BCE.For the Greek text of one of the lamellae, see PHI Greek Inscriptions 37:497A It seems to have been a place of some importance even in the time of Pindar. Alexander the Great passed through the town in his rapid march from Illyria to Boeotia. It did not revolt from the Macedonians together with the other Thessalians after the death of Alexander the Great. In the war between Antiochus III the Great and the Romans, 191 BCE, Pelinna was occupied by the Athamanians, but was soon afterwards recovered by the Romans. The location of Pelinna is at Palaiogard√≠ki (Petroporos), where there are considerable remains of the ancient town. William Martin Leake, describing the situation in the 19th century, stated that \\"the city occupied the face of a rocky height, together with a large quadrangular space at the foot of it on the south. The southern wall is more than half a mile in length, and the whole circumference near three miles.\\"Leake, Northern Greece, vol. iv. p. 288.

Content At the height of the Cold War, an infamous political show trial, known as the Sl√°nsk√Ω trial, took place in Czechoslovakia. In 1952, 14 leading Communists, including Rudolf Sl√°nsk√Ω, the second most powerful man in the country, were tried on charges of high treason and espionage. Although they were innocent of the charges, they confessed and were convicted. Most of the men were hanged, but three received life sentences. Eleven of the fourteen were Jews. The film tells the story of the trial and the paranoia of the period through testimonies, trial footage, archival films and extensive documentation. Among the people who appear in the film are Lise London, whose late husband Artur London was one of the defendants and wrote about the trial in a widely published memoir \\"The Confession;\\" Eduard Goldstucker, a Kafka scholar and the first Czech ambassador to Israel who was jailed and forced to testify at the trial; and Jan Kavan, the former Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs, whose father, also a trial witness, died shortly after his release from prison. What led these men to their passionate belief in Communism and why did they publicly confess to crimes they did not commit?

This mosque is called Al-Buraq Mosque because of a ring that is nailed to its wall where Muslims believe Mohammad tied his Al- Buraq that carried him from al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid al-Aqsa during the Night Journey of ‚ÄúAl-Isra‚Äô wa Al-Mi‚Äôraj.‚Äù (PASSIA, 2013) Today it is located inside the vaulted passage that once led to Bab Hittah (Gate of Forgiveness) or Barclay's Gate, which is at the south end of the Buraq Wall. The inside of Bab Hittah (or Barclay‚Äôs Gate) which served as an entrance to al-Aqsa Mosque during the early Islamic period is currently known as al-Buraq Mosque. (Al- Ratrout, 2004) The entrance to the underground structure faces north in the immediately left of the Bab al-Magharibah. Jewish Claims on the Masjid Temple mount traditionalists calls Bab Hittah or Barclay‚Äôs Gate as Kiponus Gate, mentioned as the one western gate of the outer court in the Mishnah (Middoth 3:1). They also suppose that the Kiponus Gate was named after Coponius (A.D 6-9), a Roman Procurator, thus one of the four gates described by Josephus. (Robertson, 2013) Additionally, the gate and the adjacent mosque are supposed to be the place of the cave synagogue frequented by the Jews after returning to Jerusalem from their long banishment. (Sams, 2015) Moreover, many Jews doubt the Night Journey and Ascension, one of the key events happened in Muhammad‚Äôs life. The Qur‚Äôan directly indicates this event in Surah Al-Isra: ‚ÄúExalted is He who took His Servant by night from al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid al-Aqsa, whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him of Our signs. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Seeing.‚Äù (17:1) Today, while some orientalists state that Masjid Al-Aqsa was erected in commemoration of this miraculous event, others claim that neither anyone witnessed that Night Journey, nor did Muhammad show any tangible evident. (Nor, 2011) However, all of the falsifications behind these statements ensue from the inability to comprehend the core sources of Islam: the Qur‚Äôan and the hadiths of Muhammad. In Qur‚Äôan, not only in Surah Al-Isra, also many verses contain many references all of whom identified with Bait al-Maqdis (Islamicjerusalem) and Al-Aqsa Mosque; such as al-Zaytun (Mount of Olives), mubawwa sidq (safe residence), rabwah (high ground) that qarar (having a meadow) [means the eternal hill]. (Nor, 2011) Therefore, it can be argued that Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa and its total enclave is highly away from the attempts that aim to eliminate the Islamic importance of not only Al-Buraq Musalla but also Al-Buraq Wall and surrounding al-Masjid Al-Aqsa in Bayt al-Maqdis. Today, another problematic situation that the Masjid faces is the Zionist excavations spread in under the Masjid al-Aqsa enclave to reach the so-called aims. Historical Background of the Masjid Due to the bilateral relations of Al-Buraq Mosque and Bab Hittah or Barclay's Gate transformed to the masjid, the historical background of one of them can give an approximate way to identify the other. According to Barclay and his followers‚Äô archeological researches especially on the gate, the height and the width of the gate are known, which can also give an opinion about the masjid. The gate measuring 5.06 metres in width and 8.80 metres in height of the doorway (Al-Ratrout, 2004) provides insight into the dimensions of the masjid. According to archeological views; it can be concluded that this gate was used as an entrance gate to Al-Aqsa Mosque during the Umayyad period, in connection with structural features, such as the chamfered edge as a distinctive feature of all Umayyad gates leading to the enclave. (Al-Ratrout, 2004) According to the architectural elements in Al-Buraq Mosque and its gate, which is also exist in also the Golden Gate (Al-Rahma) and the Double Gate, show its historical traces dated to Umayyad period. Besides, a sign outside Al-Buraq Musalla indicates that this monumunet dates back to Mamluk period. Overall, the gate passage was in use until some time after 985 AD when it was blocked and changed into a cistern adjacent to Al-Buraq Mosque. (Al-Ratrout, 2004) Even though the main gate of Al-Buraq Mosque located in Western Wall of Masjid Al-Aqsa is permanently sealed, still the mosque is open for prayers use from another entrance located in Al-Aqsa‚Äôs western corridor.

It is significant as the home of farmer and hybrid corn populizer Roswell Garst. During the 1930s and 1940s, Garst played an active role in the conversion of old-style family farms to modern agribusiness. He was a key marketer of hybrid seed corn, which greatly increased corn yields per acre. Further, he espoused the use of nitrogen and other chemical fertilizers to renew soil so that fields need not be left fallow in order for the soil to replenish, allowing farmers to grow more acres of corn. Additionally, he embraced the use of cellulose from corncobs left after processing seed corn as cattle feed. (82 pages, with exterior and interior photos) The farm is also famous as site of a visit on September 23, 1959, by Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev.Stephen J. Frese, ‚ÄúComrade Khrushchev and Farmer Garst: East-West Encounters Foster Agricultural Exchange.‚Äù The History Teacher 38#1 (2004), pp. 37‚Äì65. online. The visit was not their first meeting, and it was by Khrushchev's request. Garst's farm had been visited by Soviet officials first in 1955, as an unofficial extra when they were on an organized tour of smaller farms. The Garst farm, with its use of hybrid corn and other agricultural innovations, was the only large size farm at all comparable to the scale of Soviet collective farms that the official was able to visit, and that was only by getting away from the official tour. Subsequently, Garst visited the Soviet Union to sell hybrid corn there and spread information about modern American farming methods. He met Khrushchev, and they found they had much in common. Three years later, a group of Soviet officials were sent to spend three months at the farm, participating in all of its activities.Fursenko, Aleksandr and Timothy Naftali. Khrushchev's Cold War: The Inside Story of an American Adversary. Paperback ed. New York: Norton, 2007. . When Khrushchev visited America in 1959, he was adamant that his visit include a trip to Garst's farm in Iowa. After the conclusion of the visit, Llewellyn Thompson, then the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, stated that the visit to the Garst farm was one of the most significant parts of Khrushchev's journey to the United States. This visit, combined with plummeting yields from Soviet agriculture, helped to lead Khrushchev to attempt an overhaul of the Soviet agricultural system. The main building is a 1.5 story farmhouse. It includes 11 other contributing buildings, 3 contributing structures and one contributing site. The farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 12, 2009 and the listing was announced as the featured listing in the National Park Service's weekly list of August 21, 2009.

The thirty-fifth of sixty-four Progress spacecraft to visit Mir, it used the Progress-M 11F615A55 configuration, and had the serial number 217. In addition to delivering cargo, Progress M-17 was also used to demonstrate extended duration Progress missions; remaining in orbit for almost a year with a docked phase lasting 132 days. Launch and docking Progress M-17 was launched at 03:34:13 GMT on 31 March 1993, atop a Soyuz-U2 carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. It docked with the aft port of the Kvant-1 module at 05:16:18 GMT on 1 April, less than 26 hours after launch. The rocket had the serial number N15000-069. The spacecraft carried supplies including food, water and oxygen for the EO-13 and EO-14 crews aboard Mir, as well as equipment for conducting scientific research, and fuel for adjusting the station's orbit and performing manoeuvres. In all, Progress M-17 delivered of cargo to Mir. It carried the seventh VBK-Raduga recoverable capsule, however due to the extended duration mission this was returned by Progress M-18. Extended mission Progress M-17 was originally scheduled to conduct a normal length mission, however it remained docked with Mir for 132 days because of a longer than usual gap between missions requiring its docking port. Soyuz TM-16 had docked with the Kristall module in order to test the APAS-89 docking system ahead of its use in the Shuttle-Mir programme, leaving the forward port free for Progress M-18, whose docking marked the first time two Progress spacecraft had been docked to a station simultaneously. It undocked from Mir at 15:36:42 GMT on 11 August. Due to its extended mission, the spacecraft did not have sufficient fuel remaining to deorbit, and it was therefore kept in orbit for 205 days of free flight, until its orbit had decayed sufficiently for a deorbit burn to be conducted with what fuel remained. During this time, Progress M-17 was used for further tests of the spacecraft's longevity. After being manoeuvred into an orbit away from the station, its systems were deactivated and it was kept in a low-power configuration. On 2 March the spacecraft was reactivated and successfully completed a series of manoeuvres to prove that it could still operate after having been in orbit for so long. The next day, Progress M-17 was deorbited and reentered the atmosphere over the South America, breaking up at around 03:28 GMT.

It is used by about 66,000 passengers per day and 24,000,000 per year. The first temporary station was opened in 1854 at the end of the line from Turin. Lines were later opened to Milan, Rome and the French border at Ventimiglia. History The station derives its name from the adjacent Piazza del Principe (In Italian literally \\"plaza of the prince\\"), located next to the Palazzo del Principe (literally \\"palace of the prince\\") adjacent to the street called Via Andrea Doria in the Fassolo neighbourhood. The small goods yard, which was the core of the original station, occupies the area between Piazza del Principe, Via Andrea Doria and Piazza Acquaverde, where the main entrance is situated. Foreigners often call the station Genova Porta Principe, perhaps confused by the names of stations in other cities, such as Milano Porta Garibaldi and Torino Porta Nuova. Note that there was once a gate in the medieval city walls called Porta San Tommaso (and sometimes called Porta Principe) where the steps to the Piazza Principe Metro station are now located and where some remains of the walls can still be seen. It was demolished in the nineteenth century. Opening of the Piazza Principe‚ÄìSampierdarena section in 1854 The original station was designed by architect Alexander Mazzucchetti and construction began in 1853 and was completed and inaugurated in 1860. The original building had a single-span steel and glass roof, covering ten platforms and buildings for arrivals, departures and transiting passengers. At the time of the official inauguration of the Turin-Genoa railway in February 1854 only a temporary station had been opened. In 1872, with the opening of the tunnel directly connecting with Brignole station, through platforms were added on the north of the original station. Until the 1960s the terminal platforms were used for passenger trains, mainly for local services to and from the west and north. Since then all passenger trains have operated on the eleven through tracks, while the terminal tracks are now used for the storage of wagons and locomotives. In 1900, an increase in rail traffic led to the building of an extension of the station to a design by the engineer Giacomo Radini Tedeschi. On 15 May 1916, the station was electrified at 3,300 V AC three-phase at 15 Hz. It was converted to the current standard of to 3000 volts DC, first on the Genoa‚ÄìRome line and later on the Genoa‚ÄìMilan line. The last to abandon the three-phase system was the Genoa‚ÄìTurin line between 1962 and 1964. During the Second World War, in common with other Italian railway stations, the roof covering the tracks was dismantled to extract its metal. In order to handle an increase in metropolitan traffic an underground connection was opened in 1993 between Genoa Brignole and Genoa Sampierdarena, including a new underground station under Genova Piazza Principe with two platforms called Genova Principe Sotterranea. Access to the underground station can be reached either via the escalators in the main station building or from an area located near the Genoa Maritime Terminal (Italian: Stazione marittima di Genova) between the streets of Piazza del Principe, Via Fanti d'Italia and Via Bersaglieri d'Italia, where there is an interchange between rail, bus and metro.Mario Bianchi: Il passante di Genova. In: I Treni n. 140 (september 1993), p. 14. Today Genova Piazza Principe's platforms Today the Piazza Principe is on several levels: *the underground level contains the Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) utility rooms and warehouses and the two suburban rail tracks that form the underground station; *the platform level is placed below the ground floor and is almost entirely occupied by offices of the FS, utility rooms, warehouses, commercial and catering services; *the ground floor building contains the main retail businesses and services for passengers; *the higher levels are fully occupied by offices.

Generals Order is the first Chinese strategy trading card game developed by a Singapore company and despite its humble beginnings, has a player base in the hundreds and growing. Generals Order can be played by two or more players each using a deck of printed cards.http://www.generals-order.com The number of cards in one deck can vary from forty to sixty cards. Gameplay Features Generals Order is a strategy trading card game that was developed based on ancient Chinese history and the Chinese classic novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. In this game, a player takes on the role of a commander-in-chief of an army, with warriors, weapons, and the gift of intelligence at your disposal. The gameplay comprises many features adopted from other TCGs, being a medley and a combination of a multitude of other TCGs in terms of gameplay. The game starts by having both players draw 5 cards from their deck and drawing one card per turn from then on after determining the starting party. The player to start first is denied his first draw. Victory Conditions Every game simulates a fierce battle with a rival camp, with the aim of ultimately destroying their fortress, and successfully defending yours. The fortress is represented by the players' deck of cards, commonly referred to as the resource deck. Victory is gained when a player ensures that their own resource deck outlast their opponents'. This is achieved by removing all of the enemy's deck either to the discard pile or graveyard. This is similar to WWE TCG, which also use the deck as resources, victory conditions and survival. There are two common ways of achieving this; one is to attack the opponent's resource deck, or fortress, with warriors, the other is to build up a strong enough defense to ensure that the opponent draws himself to death.http://www.generals-order.com/index.swf Position System The playing area consists of mainly 4 areas, within own city/fortress(Ëá™ÂüéÂÜÖ), outside own city/fortress(Ëá™ÂüéÂ§ñ), outside enemy city/fortress(ÊïåÂüéÂ§ñ) and inside enemy city/fortress(ÊïåÂüéÂÜÖ). Usually the main playing area will be the first 3 zones as the last zone(inside enemy city/fortress)can only be accessed through certain special cards. This is similar to Pokemon TCG's benching system. Other areas include the resource stack, which is actually the area between the inside own city/fortress and the outside own city/fortress. The deck is effectively the wall of your city/fortress. There is also the discard pile, where discarded cards go, and the dead zone/graveyard, which is similar to the discard pile except that the cards placed in the graveyard are removed from play altogether and cannot be returned to the deck in the middle of the game. Another area for higher level play is the command zone. The position system is important as generals(see character cards) are only allowed one action per turn, which is either an attack or a movement, but not both unless the general uses a special effect or if the player uses certain event cards(see Event\\\\Strategy cards). Generals are able to move directly from within own city/fortress(Ëá™ÂüéÂÜÖ) to outside enemy city/fortress(ÊïåÂüéÂ§ñ) if the number of enemy generals outside own city/fortress is equal to the number of friendly generals there. Card Types In Generals Order, there are six different type of card categories, namely the character card, the event/strategy card, the special card, the equipment card, the advantageous card, and the command/order card. Any deck can only have up to 3 of the exactly same card. Character Cards(Generals) Character cards are also known as general cards. They form the most of a typical deck's offensive force. All character cards have a summon cost, Military attack(also known as STR, strength or damage) and Intelligence attack(also known as INT, intel). For a character/general to be successfully summoned, the player must discard an equal number of hand cards as the summon cost of the character. All characters are summoned within own city/fortress unless stated. A character summoned on this turn cannot attack or move until the next turn unless stated otherwise(they still can activate special effects/ÁâπÊïà though). Military attack is most commonly used and is the determining factor in direct combat(commanding your general to attack an enemy general within the same zone). The general with the higher military attack wins in this situation, in which case the general with the lower military attack is placed in the graveyard of that player. In the case of equal military attack, both generals die simultaneously. Characters do not have any hp and they die on impact, similar to Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG. Intelligence attack is usually only used in conjunction with a strategy card. It has no set mechanics instead refers to the strategy card that initiates a strategy attack. On top of the basic statistics, all generals have either a special effect(ÁâπÊïà) or specialty(ÁâπÁÇπ). The only difference between the two is that special effects have to be activated and they usually cost a certain number of hand cards to do so. Specialties are passive and innate, like an aura effect. Special effects are not considered as an action the general takes, however one can only use any special effect from one general once per turn. A special thing to note about Generals Order is that once a general is dead, the same player cannot summon the same general again, or summon any character having the same name as the dead general(in the case of the different cards bearing the same character in different factions). This makes Generals Order very different from other TCGs. Event/Strategy Cards Event or strategy cards are similar to the magic cards in Yu-Gi-Oh! or trainer/supporter cards in Pokemon TCG. They also have a casting cost, similar to the character cards, but they are usually discarded or removed from play once used. They usually provide certain forms of support(like enabling the player to draw more cards, or summon characters at less cost) or initiate an attack which uses Intelligence to determine the winner. The latter are also known as spell cards. Event cards range from all sorts of effects, from direct removal of the enemy's deck cards to the discard pile to weird effects that can kill the entire enemy army once one of the enemy's generals is killed. Their effects usually last for the casting player's turn only. Spells also come in different types, some targeting a single enemy general, other being able knockout all enemies within a zone at once. Certain spells are also known to be restricted to certain zones. Special Cards Special cards are like trap cards in Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG. They are the only cards you can use on the enemy's turn and they usually are a buff to your generals or a special effect to render the enemy useless. Each special card has a different trigger of activation. They, like event cards, also have a cast cost. Equipment Cards Equipment cards are classified further to Troops or Weaponry. These cards are attached to generals and cannot be unattached without special effect from other cards. They usually provide a permanent boost to the general's raw statistics. A general can only be attached with one Troop type and one Weaponry type at a time unless stated otherwise. Advantageous cards Advantageous cards are horizontal. These cards need conditions to activate its abilities. The abilities will help the player in battle. But there can only be one of these cards on the battlefield. Once a player casts his/her advantageous card, the other player will have to discard his/her advantageous card. These cards do not have a casting cost. Command/Order cards These cards are very special and they are not included in the main deck. They provide certain forms of permanent support to the player throughout the game. They do not have to be drawn or discarded and are placed on the command zone on the field before the start of the game. Affiliation In generals order, there is an affiliation mechanic which works based on the factions of the generals the player wants to summon. Basically, the cost for summoning a general is lowered when a general of the same faction is already on the field. Each summoned general provides a -1 discount for the next general. This effect is passive, stackable and cannot be \\"used up\\". Consumption A special aspect of Generals Order is the need to \\"feed\\" your generals once per turn. Right before a player ends his/her turn, they must remove the number of cards equal to the total number of generals they have summoned on to any part of the playing field(excluding the graveyard) from their deck to the discard pile. Certain generals or equipment require more resources to be discarded per turn. This mechanic stops players from summoning huge numbers of generals at a time and also promotes more active use of your generals. Factions When one thinks of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one would naturally think of the three main factions, which are W√®i (È≠è), Sh«î (ËúÄ), and W√∫ (Âê≥). In Generals Order, all cards are classified into factions and there are currently six different factions, represented by six different colors. Each color/faction has its own unique traits and characteristics. Factions are official classifications of cards, which is a benchmark for the maximum cards a player can have in his hand cards at the end of his turn. Extra cards need to be discarded. A pure 1 faction player can have up to 10, a 2 faction player can have up to 8 and those with 3 or more faction in their deck can only have up to 6. The smallest maximum hand size is currently 6. Blue (ËúÄ) Led by the warlord Liu Bei, this is one of the 3 main factions in history. Being portrayed as the main protagonists in history, they are known to be benevolent, stoic, loyal and righteous. In the game, this faction comprises many of the well known warriors like Guan Yu, Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun, and the great advisor Zhuge Liang. The characteristic of the blue faction is having a large number of good warrior cards and cards which force the enemy to move. Hence, people who play Shu usually go for a more offensive approach. However they should be wary against spell caster decks. Red (È≠è) Led by the warlord Cao Cao, this is one of the 3 main factions in history. Cao Cao is known to be an extremely clever individual who excels in both charisma and war. However he is also a controversial person as he is usually depicted to be egocentric and a megalomaniac. In the game, this faction is known to be offensive and swift in attack. They also have an abnormally high number of high intelligence generals. The characteristics of the red faction is that they have the most number of cards, among all the factions, that deal damage directly to the opponents resource deck. Green (Âê≥) Led by the warlord Sun Quan, this is one of the 3 main factions in history. An elusive yet powerful faction in history, they are well known for hiding their strengths until the last moment and acting passively but surely. In the game, this faction is known to be defensive in nature. The characteristics of the green faction is that they have the most number of defensive cards and players playing green will usually adopt a defensive strategy as well. They have lots of buffs that only work while the generals are in either within own city(Ëá™ÂüéÂÜÖ) or outside own city(Ëá™ÂüéÂ§ñ). Purple (Ëë£) Led by the warlord Dong Zhuo, who was a historical character that was featured slightly before the three kingdom period. He was well-known to be brutal and incredibly malicious and despicable in his doings as a ruler. Well known warriors in this faction include L√º Bu, one of the strongest fighters during that period. The Characteristic of the purple faction is that the nature of their cards tend to allow the players to deal extra damage and they have lots of high cost, high damage generals with few low cost ones. Brown (Ë¢Å) Led by the warlord Yuan Shao, who was also a historical character during that period. His note to fame was when he led a personal campaign against Dong Zhuo. The characteristic of the brown faction is cheap cost, high damage generals that cause the user to attain some damage in order to play the card due to their specialty. Yellow (ÈªÑ) Led by Zhang Jiao, a sorcerer that started the famous Yellow Turban Rebellion. They are, in history, a bunch of uninteresting regional gangs that staged a large uprising by drawing large crowds to them and using sheer numbers to overrun the Dong Zhuo government. Characteristics of the yellow faction is that they usually attack in numbers, and users of this faction will usually attack the opponent's fortress with a horde of warriors due to the incredibly low summon costs of almost all their generals. Orange (‰æØ) This faction is made up of eighteen warlords and led by Yuan Shao. This army is built during the start of the Three Kingdoms era. It rivaled against the chancellor, Dong Zhuo(purple faction). They existed historically around the same time as Dong Zhuo's regime but split later to the standard Shu(Blue faction), Wei(Red faction), Wu(Green faction), and Yuan(Brown faction) factions. They fight based on a highly uncommon scavenger style that changes the statistics of many of their generals based on the number of their dead. Dark Green (ËõÆ) The new faction to be released in version 4, this faction sports the southern barbaric tribes of ancient China. It is led by Meng Huo, who later joined Shu in version 5. The generals in this faction have unique abilities and usually rely on the number opponents hand cards or generals for its ability to be very effective. Grey (Êó†Ôºâ Cards that are grey do not belong to any faction. These cards are usually event or strategy cards. There are some faction-less generals but they are extremely rare. There is a series of strategies called the \\"Thirty-six Strats\\" are a set of very powerful but situational event cards found in this faction. The strategies are derived from Sun Tze's Art of War. Special Factions Silver (Êù∞) This faction name literally means \\"Outstanding\\". Generals from this faction are considered legendary and do not belong to the Three Kingdom era, but found further in the past. Extremely rare, possibly only available during events. Most of them have very powerful abilities. For example, one of them allows you to summon another general from your hand cards for free every time you kill an opponent general. However, some of them have immensely devastating specialties such as having to discard more than half your deck when they die, or having to discard a card whenever they do an action every turn. Rainbow (Âèå) This faction consist of most general that used to have double affiliation, such as Sun Shangxiang being sister of Sun Quan and wife of Liu Bei, this cause her to have double affiliation of being both Shu and Wu general.

At this point, however, Anne dies from exhaustion, and Robert follows her a few days later. The crew of the ship make it to North Africa, where they are captured by the Moors. One of their fellow prisoners, called Morales of Seville, is ransomed and sent back to Castile, but on the way back he is captured by a servant of Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal. When Prince Henry hears of the story he promptly sends out an expedition that finds the island of Madeira. This version of the story was supposedly written down by a member of Prince Henry's household, and became the basis for several later versions. It is known to date back at least to 1579. Another tradition is probably older, and can be traced back to 1507. In this version, Machin survives his lover, and builds an oratory over her grave. He makes it off the island and eventually ends up at the royal court of Castile. Finally, a third version tells of a French merchant by the name of il Macino. This adventurer, known from the writings of Giulio Landi, differs from the other two in two senses: he has no mistress, and he later returns to colonise the island. Though it is unknown whether the story of Machin is true, the island still carries a reminder of him in the name of the city Machico, which supposedly was named after him. It is certain that the discovery of Madeira predates the Portuguese settlement, as it appears on maps as early as 1339. In 1419 Jo√£o Gon√ßalves Zarco landed on the island, and colonised it for Portugal.Bolt 2007, pp. 21-2.

History It was in 1951 when the marketer Epaminondas Mendon√ßa had the idea to realize during the holy week the scenes of life, death and resurrection of Jesus, in the streets of the small parish of Fazenda Nova. The idea surges after his readings in a magazine about a German city (Oberammergau) who was doing something similar called Passion Play. In 1956, Pl√≠nio Pacheco arrives in Brejo da Madre de Deus and soon married Diva Pacheco, daughter of Epaminondas and local actress. In 1958, Plinio become director of the theater and in 1962 he had the idea to build the New Jerusalem Theater as a small replica of the Jerusalem city. The city theatre just was finished in 1968, and since then Plinio Pacheco was the Director until his death in 2002.

Originally from Edo, he spent some time in Nagasaki, where he studied under the Chinese painter Song Ziyan, who was known as S≈ç Shigan in Japanese. The name S≈ç Shiseki is an art-name, derived from an imitation of his master's name.Morse, Anne Nishimura et al. (eds.) MFA Highlights: Arts of Japan. Boston: Museum of Fine Arts, 2008. p. 201. Shiseki's bird and flower paintings and other works display the use of a combination of broad calligraphic brushstrokes for branches, tree trunks and rocks, ink wash and color for flower petals and leaves, and much finer brushstrokes for the fine details of feathers and flowers to produce a very detailed and lifelike, realistic depiction. Returning to Edo, Shiseki became a prominent representative and teacher of the Nagasaki school in that city, teaching Shiba K≈çkan among others. He was close with such rangaku scholars as Hiraga Gennai and Sugita Genpaku, and expressed an interest in Western painting. Rather than his stylistic choice coming straight from European painting, however, scholar Meccarelli thinks Shiseki matured Nanpin school‚Äôs ‚Äúflora and fauna decorative painting‚Äù.Marco, Meccarelli. 2015. \\"Chinese Painters in Nagasaki: Style and Artistic Contaminatio during the Tokugawa Period (1603-1868)\\" Ming Qing Studies 2015, Pages 175-236.

A scene from the opening of Manzoni‚Äôs I promessi sposi. Bravi (sing. bravo; sometimes translated as ‚Äòbravoes‚Äô) were a species of coarse soldiery or hired assassins employed by the rural lordlings (or dons) of northern Italy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to protect their interests. The word derives, probably, from the Latin pravus (bad, wicked, evil) via the Spanish bravo, in the sense of violent, aggressive, savage, and impulsive. Their fame‚Äîand their reputation as frightening and domineering bullies‚Äîrests in part on their striking presence in Alessandro Manzoni‚Äôs historical novel The Betrothed (1827), which became one of the best-known Italian works of fiction of the nineteenth century and which opens with an extended description of the phenomenon. They were not, however, a fictional invention: his research into local history enabled Manzoni to ascertain from the dates of publication of various proclamations against the bravi that they had been present in Italy from at least 1583 and until at least 1632.  The bravi of The Betrothed  The bravi retained by Don Rodrigo include Grignapoco, Griso, Montanarolo, Sfregiato, Squinternotto, Tanabuso and Tira-dritto.

It was begun by Jaya Raya, also called Bichi Raja, an ally of the Ratta Dynasty, in the year 1204 AD. It has undergone several renovations over the centuries under dynastic rulers of the region. The fort, built with fine ramparts and a large moat, has a rich history with historical and religious monuments dated to the Adil Shahi dynasty. The fort has been captured in battles many times, as the possession of local rulers, until the region was stabilized by the British Raj. It is notable in modern history because Mahatma Gandhi was imprisoned by the British in this fort during India‚Äôs freedom struggle. Geography The fort is in the foothills of the Sahyadri mountain range of (Western Ghats) in the precincts of the Belagavi town (which was also known as Belgaum or ‚ÄòVenugrama‚Äô meaning bamboo village), at an altitude of about , from the Arabian Sea. The Markandeya River flows nearby. There is a Lake in front of the Fort know as Killa Lake. History The fort‚Äôs history is traced to the Ratta Dynasty with lineage to the Rashtrakuta Dynasty (earlier chieftains of Saundatti, who later shifted their capital to Belgaum), Vijayanagara emperors, Bijapur Sultans or Bahmanis, Marathas (Shivaji Maharaj)and finally by the British in that order. Before Rattas, Shatavahanas, Chalukyas and Kadambas from Goa have ruled over the region. The Belgaum fort belonged to the Ratta dynasty from the time it was built in 1204 AD by a Ratta officer named Bichiraja. Belgaum, the city around the fort, served as the capital of that dynasty between 1210 AD and 1250 AD. Rattas were defeated by the Yadava Dynasty of Devagiri, and they briefly controlled the fort. At the turn of the 14th century, the Khaljis of Delhi invaded and succeeded in ruining the indigenous powers of the region ‚Äî the Yadava and the Hoysalas ‚Äîwithout providing a viable administration. This lacuna was made good by the Vijayanagara Empire, which had become the established power of the area by 1336 AD. In 1474 AD, the Bahmani Sultanate, then ruling from Bidar, captured the fort of Belgaum under the leadership of Mahamood Gawan. In 1518 AD, the Bahamani Sultanate split up into five small states, and Belgaum became part of the Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. The Ismail Adil Shah of Adilshahi dynasty reinforced the fort with the help of Asad Khan Lari (a Persian from the province of Lar) and much of the existing structures dates from 1519 AD. In Belgaum, the rule of Adilshahs began in the times of Ismail Adil Shah. Asad Khan Lari assisted Ismail in the battle for the fort and conferred with Belgaum as his jagir in 1511 AD (in 1519 AD, Asad Khan completed the Masjid Safa in the Belgaum fort). In 1686, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb defeated the Bijapur sultanate, and Belgaum came under his control. This was a short-lived control because, after the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal empire's control declined. With this changed situation, the Maratha confederacy was taken over by the Peshwas. In 1776, Hyder Ali of Mysore won over this region, but only for a short period. The Peshwas, with British assistance, defeated Hyder Ali and regained control of Belgaum. With changed circumstances over the years, the same British attacked the Belgaum fort, which was under Peshwas control. They held it under siege from 21 March to 12 April 1818 and took control of the fort and deposed the Peshwas. Shivalinga Raju, the Kittur Desai, helped the British in this attack on the fort. As a reward, the British allowed Desai to rule over Belgaum town and the fort. Fort structure Belgaum Fort is one of the oldest in the state of Karnataka. It had fortifications designed to repel attacks of invading armies. It was originally built by Bichiraja (Ratta Dynasty) in 1204. Built in an undulating plain, the fort has an oval shape and is surrounded by a deep and wide moat excavated in soft red stone. The external side is a broad esplanade with bastions which rise to about from the bottom of the moat. The internal dimensions of the fort, which has a level ground, is in length and in width. Two massive bastions flanked by a large gate, which was originally an entry gate through a bridge, has since been blocked. The gate now in use (said to have been designed by a Brahmin) is considered a fine specimen of Indian architecture. It has a guard chamber, a \\"groined roof once ornamented with pendants\\". The exterior of the gate is decorated with large motifs of animals and birds. The gateway is covered by massive doors made of iron designed for defense. An inscription on the top of the arch of the gate in Persian ascribes its building to Jakub Ali Khan. The inscription reads: > \\"Jakub Ali Khan, who is a joy to the heart, by whose benevolence the world > is prosperous, built the wall of the fort from its base as strong as the > barrier of Sicardis.\\" In 1631 AD the main gate of the fort was built. There is a western gate with an archway, which is guarded only by a chain stretched across two old cannons. This provides access from a sloping road crossed by a causeway over the moat.Guthrie, section 192. The fort has Hindu, Jain and Muslim architectural influence with temples and mosques within its limits, indicating cultural syncretism. The architectural styles seen in the mosques are of the Indo- Saracenic and Deccan type. The fort has been built with stones and mud. A wide moat runs round the fort. Temples Jain temples Kamal Basadi Jain temple in Belgaum The second Jain temple, Chikki Basadi in ruins Of the two Jain temples inside the fort, the 'Kamal Basadi', a basadi with the Neminatha idol in black stone (found in a forest nearby) deified on a stone-carved pedestal, is more famous. It was built in 1204 AD. The other temple, called the 'Chikki Basadi', is in ruins (see picture). Both temples were built inside the fort in the Chalukyan architecture style. The Mukhamantapa (Mukha main hall) of the Kamal Basadi is very impressive, with a neatly depicted lotus carving projecting from the ceiling. It is accessed through steps partly enclosed by a balustrade with a large dome of great beauty. Lotus flowers, designed in concave shape, spaced at , arranged in concentric circles in decreasing layers and depicting a central blossom of the lotus, decorate the roof. The lotus pendant is covered by a large pyramidal roof. The pillars that support the roof with the lotus pendant are founded on plinths. Some pillars made of black basaltic stones (said to have magnetic characteristics) are highly polished. It is named the Kamal Basadi since the tower of the temple depicts kamal (lotus) with 72 petals, which presently displays images of the past 24 tirthankaras but can depict the present and future thirthankars. The pillars are well carved with decorations and neatly polished. Other idols seen in the temple are of Bhagwan Sumatinath in the kayotsarga posture, Bhagwan Parshvanath under the shade of seven-hooded serpent (Nagaraj), Bhagwan Adinath in the padmasana posture and the Navagraha. The Archeology Department renovated this temple in 1996. The second Jain temple, Chikki Basadi, in ruins now, was once considered as a ‚Äúremarkable piece of Jain architecture‚Äù. It has a frontage that displays festooned rows of dancing figurines, musicians, and trimmed flowers.Guthrie, Section 211-212. Hindu temples There are two Hindu shrines at the fort entrance: one devoted to Ganesha and another to goddess Durga. The Durga temple is dedicated to multi-armed goddess Durga, as considered the goddess of forts and warfare. It is in a corner of the fort. The outer facade of the temple exhibits painted images of mythological figures. Mosques The fort has two mosques or masjids: Safa Masjid and Jamia Masjid. The former mosque is the most frequented by the Muslim population of Belgaum. Safa Masjid was completed in 1519 by Asad Khan Lari (testified by the Persian inscription). The mosque's pillars have exquisite inscriptions in a fusion of Nagari and Persian styles. It is said that two of the pillars are from Hindu temples and have Kannada inscriptions in Nagari scripts. One pillar dated to 1199 AD is credited to Ratta King Kartaveerya IV and the other pillar dated to 1261 AD is credited to Sevuna (Yadava) Krishna. The Jamia Masjid, dated 1585-86, was built by Sher Khan. Access The fort is in the precincts of Belgaum city (which is in the northwestern parts of Karnataka) and lies at the border of two states: Maharashtra and Goa. It is well connected by road, rail and air services to all parts of the country. Belgaum is connected by road via the National Highway 4 (connecting Maharashtra (now part of the Golden Quadrilateral), Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu) and NH 4A (connecting Karnataka and Goa). The road distance is to Bangalore (on the Bangalore-Pune highway); to Hyderabad and to Mumbai. It is midway between Bangalore and Mumbai. The distances to the nearest cities in the border states of Maharashtra and Goa are Hubbali - , Dharwad - , Mangalore - , Goa-, Kolhapur - and Pune - . It is close to the bus station. The airport serving the city is Belgaum Airport at Sambra which is the oldest airport in North Karnataka. It is from the city.

Although of Flemish descent, he wrote entirely in French, and lived in Paris from 1947 to 1971. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times. He is known as one of the major figures in Belgian magic realism (fantastique quotidien), and as the indefatigable editor of Signaux de France et de Belgique (later Le Disque vert). The only work translated into English is M√©moires d'Elseneur (\\"Memoirs from Elsinore\\", 1954). His father, √âmile van Ermengem, was the bacteriologist who discovered the cause of botulism. His younger brother was the writer Fran√ßois Maret (Frans van Ermengem). Life His father was a bacteriologist, and when in 1886 he was appointed professor at the University of Ghent the Van Ermengem family moved from Brussels to Wetteren, and then to Ghent in 1894. After an abortive attempt to publish a collection of sonnets, Fr√©d√©ric began studying law at the same university in 1900, but after earning his degree he gave up the idea of a legal career in order to continue writing, moving to Ixelles and taking employment as a librarian in 1906. His first book was the novel En ville morte. In 1907 he married Marguerite Nyst against the will of his parents; they had one daughter, Claire (born 1909). He published two collections of short stories, Hors-le-vent (1909) and Clart√©s latentes (1912). Portrait by L√©on Spilliaert (1920) At the outbreak of war, Hellens was ineligible for service. He spent some months in England before travelling to the C√¥te d'Azur, where he met many famous artists and writers, and fell in love with a married Russian named Maria Marcovna Miloslawski (1893‚Äì1947). He returned with her to Brussels in 1920, the same year he published M√©lusine, and married her on 20 July 1925, having divorced Marguerite in 1919. They had one daughter, Marie-Elisabeth (b. 1927), and two sons, Alexandre (1921‚Äì1940) and Serge (b. 1929). On 1 May 1921 Hellens and Andr√© Salmon founded the Signaux de France et de Belgique (1921‚Äì1941), a magazine which had great influence on Belgian literary life. He made trips to Italy in 1925 and 1926 and to Norway in 1936. His father died in 1932, an event which prompted him to begin writing his voluminous diaries. In 1937 he signed the famous Manifeste du lundi of Charles Plisnier, a denunciation of regionalism. His eldest son died in fighting near Rouen; nevertheless he continued to publish work throughout the war. Maria died on 5 October 1947. He married H√©l√®ne Burbulis on 26 November and moved to Paris, where he stayed until her death in 1971. He reestablished Le Disque vert with Ren√© de Soher in 1951, and compiled a collected volume of his poetry in 1959. Professing himself dissatisfied with all his work, he continued to write throughout his old age. In an interview from August 1970, Vladimir Nabokov said: :Hellens was a tall, lean, quiet, very dignified man of whom I saw a good deal in Belgium in the middle thirties when I was reading my own stuff in lecture halls for large √©migr√© audiences. La femme partag√©e (1929), a novel, I like particularly, and there are three or four other books that stand out among the many that Hellens wrote. I tried to get someone in the States to publish him -- Laughlin, perhaps -- but nothing came of it. Hellens would get excellent reviews, was beloved in Belgium, and what friends he had in Paris tried to brighten and broaden his reputation. It is a shame that he is read less than that awful Monsieur Camus and even more awful Monsieur Sartre.Novel, A Forum on Fiction. Spring 1971. Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.

He was particularly known for his performances in operas by Richard Wagner and created the role of Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg. Biography Franz Betz was born in Mainz and trained as a singer in Karlsruhe. He made his debut in 1856 at the Court Theater of Hanover as The Herald in Wagner's Lohengrin, after which he sang as a guest performer in various other German opera houses. His 1859 success at the Berlin State Opera in the role of Don Carlo in Verdi's Ernani, led to a permanent contract with the company. He became one of Wagner's most trusted singers,Rosenthal and Warrack (1979) p. 49 and sang the role of Hans Sachs in the world premiere of his Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg (National Theatre Munich, 1868). Betz sang the role more than a hundred times and was closely identified with the character. He also sang Wotan in Das Rheingold and Die Walk√ºre and The Wanderer in Siegfried for the first complete performance of Der Ring des Nibelungen (Bayreuth Festspielhaus, 1876). In May 1872, he was one of the four soloists in the performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony to mark the laying of the foundation stone for the Bayreuth Festspielhaus.Newman 1946, pp. 358-360. From 1882 to 1890, he served as the first president of the Genossenschaft Deutscher B√ºhnen-Angeh√∂riger (the German trade union for stage artists, technicians and administrative staff). He never sang in operas in either the United States or the United Kingdom, although he sang in concerts in London in 1882 and 1889. His singing in the 1889 concert when he was in his mid-fifties was described as \\"still without flaw\\".Musical Times quoted in Rosenthal and Warrack (1979) p. 49 Upon his retirement from the stage in 1897, Betz was made a Kammers√§nger of the Berlin State Opera. Franz Betz died on 11 August 1900 in Berlin and is buried in the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ged√§chtnis-Friedhof there.Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ged√§chtnis-Friedhof is a Protestant cemetery in the Charlottenburg area of Berlin.

The National Highways & Motorway Police (), abbreviated NH&MP;, is a police force in Pakistan that is responsible for enforcement of traffic and safety laws, security and recovery on Pakistan's National Highways and Motorway network. NH & MP use SUVs, cars and heavy motorbikes for patrolling purposes and uses speed cameras for enforcing speed limits.  History  The Pakistan Motorways Police began in 1997 for policing Pakistan's newly constructed motorway network, starting with the M-2. Later, in June 2001, it was also assigned the additional task of patrolling Pakistan's National Highways starting with Pakistan's longest national highway, the N-5. With the assignment of the additional role of patrolling the National Highways, the name of the Pakistan Motorways Police was changed to \\"National Highways & Motorway Police.\\" In February 2007, NH&MP; started policing the Makran Coastal Highway (N-10). The Inspector General of Police (Enforcement) Mr. Afzal Ali Shigri was tasked to prepare the plan for the new force. He was ably assisted by Mr. Shamim Ahmed, a junior officer from the National Transport Research Cell. He conceived, developed and prepared a comprehensive proposal to establish an efficient and modern highway police for the new motorway. With the change of the government the plan was shelved. This plan with slight modifications was established later by Mr. Iftikhar Rashid (Inspector General of Police), who not only implemented the plan but also ensured it achieved the bench marks laid down at its inception.  Organization  The NH&MP; is headquartered in Islamabad and led by the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) along with by seven Deputy Inspector-Generals (DIGs), each in charge of a separate branch. The rank structure is as follows: * Inspector General of Police (IGP) new IG (Dr. Syed Kaleem Imam) * Additional Inspector General of Police (Addl.IGP) * Deputy Inspectors General of Police (DIGs) * Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIGs) * Senior Superintendents of Police (SSPs) * Superintendents of Police (SPs) * Assistant Superintendents of Police (ASPs) * Deputy Superintendents of Police (DSPs) For policing purposes, the national highways and motorway network is divided into the following five zones, each headed by a DIG. Each Zone is divided into multiple \\"sectors\\" and led by an SSPs and SPs. Each sector is further divided into \\"beats\\", each led by a DSP. * Motorway Zone (M1, M2, M3) * N-5 North Zone * N-5 Central Zone * N-5 South Zone * West Zone  Objectives  # Manageable span of control - SP manages 250 officers and an ASP/DSP (Chief Patrol Officer) about 60 officers. # For optimum efficiency, force functions in three shifts. # Force comprises Educated Officers. # Emphasis is given on smart turnout and professionalism. # Effective accountability and senior command accountable for misdeeds of subordinates. # No documents seized during any violation of traffic rules by the commuters. # No interference from any quarter. # Complete delegation of authority and responsibility. # Only moving violations checked. Force responsible for traffic discipline, safety of commuters and initial action in crimes. # Better pay, conducive working conditions, dependable mobility, intensive professional training and induction of foreign trainers are critical factors for the success of NH&MP; department. # Officer cadre for enforcement. # Close supervision and effective command. # Distinct uniform and smart turn out. # 50% of fine collected on the Motorways/Highways utilized for road safety, rewards and welfare of the force. # SOPs for all operational activities. # Adoption of Ticketing System. # Welfare Projects including Scholarships, financial assistance for daughter‚Äôs marriage, burial assistance, welfare petrol pumps and special quota in jobs for Shaheed‚Äôs Children.  Recruitment and training  Before start of policing on M‚Äì2 (Islamabad ‚Äì Lahore Motorway) in 1997 all the officers were selected from within the existing police set ups of the country and an extensive training program was prepared for them in order to bring them up to international standards of Motorway/Expressway policing. Both local and foreign instructors imparted the training. Local training was given at Police College Sihala. To meet the international standards, experts from UK and Nordic Countries were invited who, along with local experts, trained our officers in advance driving skills and management of various types of incidents. A foreign training course with South Wales Police, U.K. and German Police in Kiel was also conducted to ameliorate personnel of this flourishing force up to the global standard of policing. In addition, services of armed forces were also utilized for advance driving skills particularly for motorcycles. In order to impart customized training related to Highways/Motorway NH&MP; has set up its own Training College at Sheikhupura with the following mandate: i) To train the newly selected Officers on basic police course. ii) To organize NH&MP; orientation training of already trained Officers. iii) To organize Driving Training for fresh recruited Officers. iv) To organize advance courses for Drivers to make them Driving Instructors. v) To organize Wireless training courses for Wireless Operators. vi) To organize short courses on SOPs & functioning of NH&MP.; vii) To organize technical courses on use of Misc. Equipment (Provida, Wireless Sets etc.). viii) To organize courses on Physical Fitness. ix) To organize Fire Shooting Course. x) To organize First Aid Training Course. xi) To conduct promotional exams for different cadres. xii) To conduct refresher courses for senior officers. xiii) To act as a platform for provision of training by foreign experts. Training Institute is working at its full swing and since January 2006, has trained over 129 trainers in different categories. Training Institute has the honor to train over 400 officers of Islamabad Model Traffic Police and recently trained 40 Senior Officers of Punjab Traffic Police as Trainers to train over 6000 newly recruited Traffic Wardens of Punjab Police. Besides this training Institute has successfully completed Lower Intermediate and Upper Class Promotion Courses in addition to a number of Capacity Building short courses like orientation for Deputationists, Refresher Courses for the CPOs/Admin Officers, Moharrars, Weapon handling, Record Keeping etc. Another landmark for the Training Institute is to complete on its own 1st Commando Course for about 27 Officers with 10 Officers doing Para Gliding Courses including 4 lady Officers. It is worth mentioning that all the above development have been made with the limited available resources under the previous guidance and encouragement of the Worthy Inspector General, NH&MP; who has been taking personal interest to make the Training Institute a hub of learning and road model for all other Police Training Institute in the country. ;Training strategy After study of the current policing system and the culture... a comprehensive training strategy is devised to build a force which is honest, professional, dedicated and service ‚Äì oriented. Main elements of the training strategy in NH&MP; are: ‚Ä¢ TNA to assess training needs ‚Ä¢ SWOT Analysis Training Techniques ‚Ä¢ Quality Instructors ‚Ä¢ Modern Techniques of Instruction 1.Syndicate/Participative System 2.Simulation Exercises 3.Case Studies 4.Driving Skills ‚Ä¢ Respectful Training Environment ‚Ä¢ Foreign Training ;Selection criteria and requirements SPO (Senior Patrolling Officer) 16 Graduation at least 2nd Division (Preferably Law) and LTV Driving Licence 20 Years to 27 Years 5' 8\\" for Male 5'4\\" for Female 3.5 to 35 with Expansion for Male only.

E Ticketing  E Ticketing project of National Highways and Motorway Police was conceived and implemented by Syed Abbas Ahsan, DIG Police. The pilot project was initiated in collaboration with PITB in July 2015 and the first trials were conducted in August 2015. After successful trials, the system was expanded and implemented on all Motorways and National Highways on 25th January 2018.https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/272695-national-highways-and-motorway- police-launch-e-ticketing-system For his successful design and implementation of the system, Mr. Abbas Ahsan received an appreciation letter from the Inspector General of Police Dr. Syed Kaleem Imam and was nominated for a Civil Award. E Ticketing is a technology-oriented solution in which the Patrol Officers are equipped with a hand held device connected with central data server. It enables the officers to issue tickets to commuters on the spot, verify vehicle registration, license information and maintain a retrievable and geo-tagged record of rules violations. Moreover, the system also documents road accidents, help provided to commuters and their feedback. In addition, the system tracks and keeps a complete record of the performance of each officer along with timestamps and geo-tags. The project is also cost efficient as the costs including capital and recurring costs are less than the cost of printing of challan books in the paper based ticketing system.

It was the preferred choice of clothing for women of upper and middle classes for daily wear. Unlike the typical sompot, it is more of a pant than a skirt. The chong kraben is described by art historian Eksuda Singhalampong as \\"...a garment that resembles loose breeches. The wearer wraps a rectangular piece of cloth around his [or her] waist, the edge of cloth is then passed between the legs and tucked in at the wearer's lower back. Many 19th-century European accounts often called them knee breeches, riding breeches or knickerbockers.\\"  Etymology  Sompot Chong Kben (Khmer: ·ûü·üÜ·ûñ·ûè·üã·ûÖ·ûÑ·ûÄ·üí·ûî·û∑·ûì) is a combination of three Khmer words; sampot (a long, rectangular cloth worn around the lower body), chong (to wrap around), and kben (refers to the lower body cloth wrapped around the waist and then pulled back between the legs and tucked in at the back). In short, this type of cloth is known as kben or chong kben, literally means \\"to wrap or to wear the kben\\" in Khmer language. Whereas chong kraben () is used among Thai people and derived from these Khmer words.  History  The history of sompot chong kben dates back to ancient Cambodia, where deities were often portrayed wearing such styles. References to most Khmer elders told a legend related to this garment. It said that a long time ago, the Khmer people worn sompot chong kben, following the Indian tradition. In those times, India provided many religions, but the most important one was Hinduism, as the Khmer king at that time built the temples such as Angkor Wat, also dedicated to Hinduism. In the era of the Khmer empire, most of the people were likely to read and see The Reamker at the Angkor Wat carving in the first floor as well. The origin of sompot chong kben is known as Indian. Also prayed and blessed to was a deva known as Hanuman, the guard of Prince Rama in India's famous mythology, Ramayana, as well as the Khmer adaptation, Reamker. To show its power, Indians preferred to wear the sompot chong kben as their costume but today, countries under the Greater India, such as Cambodia, also wear it for special occasions.*Sereysothera In Ramayana mythology, Hanuman is a symbol of bravery, cleverness, and power, so the people, when wearing the sompot chong kben, always drop a tail at the back like Hanuman's monkey tail. This practice lead a lot of people to believe that all Indians were guards of Hanuman. The influence of sompot chong kben, known as Dhoti in India, were strongly incorporated into Khmer culture from the ancient times to today. Apparently, this fabric is also known to be worn by Tamil people in south India, as well as Khmer people, till today.] In fact, sompot chong kben is the tradition of southern India, and was imported to early Cambodian Kingdom, Funan by King Kaundinya I. In the middle of the 13th and 14th centuries, Thai people (from Sukhothai Kingdom, known as Thailand today) and Lao people (from Lan Xang, known as Lao today) had adopted the wearing of sompot chong kben from Khmer. They considered it superior for enjoying the special occasions, and useful for royalty or monarchy in their local royal palace, because the Thai people and Lao people had used sompot chong kben in a similar way.http://neary- khmer.blogspot.com/2009/07/cen-tamil.html Images File:Diety wearing Chang Kben, Phnom Da, Angkor Borei, Cambodia.jpg|6th century Khmer depiction of Balarama wearing Sompot Chong Kben from Phnom Da temple, Angkor Borei, Takeo, Cambodia.

It operates through more than 250 subsidiaries including IL&FS; Investment managers, IL&FS; financial services and IL&FS; Transportation networks India Limited (ITNL). Its projects include some of the largest infrastructure projects in India including India's longest tunnel, Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee Tunnel, which opened for traffic in April 2017. After the company defaulted on its loans in 2018, the Government of India took control of the company and appointed a new board.  History  IL&FS; was formed in 1987 as an \\"RBI registered Core Investment Company\\" by three financial institutions, namely the Central Bank of India, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and Unit Trust of India (UTI), to provide finance and loans for major infrastructure projects. Gradually, as the organisation needed better financing, it additionally opened itself to two large international players, namely Mitsubishi (through Orix corporation Japan) and the Abu Dhabi Investment authority. Subsequently, Life Insurance Corporation India, Orix and ADIA became its largest shareholders, a pattern that continues to this day. Currently, its institutional shareholders include Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), ORIX and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, with small shareholdings by a few Indian banks. State Bank of India (SBI) was a share holder till 2017, after which it sold its stake in the company. A few foreign investors including Greenspring associates remain investors in its subsidiary companies, especially IL&FS; transportation and IL&FS; infrastructure services. In 2012, A2Z Group acquired the property management subsidiary of IL&FS; (IL&FS; Property Management & Services Ltd) in a cash and stock deal. The deal was done through its subsidiary A2Z Infraservices Ltd for ‚Çπ 25 crore. While ‚Çπ7 crore cash payment was made to IL&FS; Infrastructure Equity Fund and IL&FS; Employees Welfare Trust, the infrastructure major also took a 20% stake in A2Z Infraservices by way of a stock swap. In April 2019, its newly constituted board informed investors that the company had 302 entities through which it currently operates.  Group companies  IL&FS; headquarters at the Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai IL&FS; has 256 group companies as of 2018, including subsidiaries, joint venture companies and associate entities. Though on the surface, the company appears to have 23 direct subsidiaries, 141 indirect subsidiaries (including special purpose vehicles for different projects), 6 joint ventures and 4 associate companies, each of them is further subdivided into additional legal entities, with much cross ownership as well as ownership by investment vehicles of various governments. While some of its subsidiaries (such as IL&FS; Transport) ran into high losses in 2018 and found it difficult to repay their loans, others (such as IL&FS; investment managers) posted profits of ‚Çπ72.5 crore in 2018, a 33% profit after tax. Some of them are listed below- ;Infrastructure Services * IL&FS; Energy Development Company Limited: energy sector arm involved in development of power generation and transmission projects * IL&FS; Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited: advisory and project development * IL&FS; Transportation Networks Limited: involved in the development and implementation of projects related to surface transport (highways, flyovers, bridges and roads) * IL&FS; Environmental Infrastructure & Services Limited * IL&FS; Education and Technology Services Limited (Headed by RCM Reddy) * New Tirupur Area Development Corporation Limited (an SPV to implement the Tirupur Area Development Programme) * Noida Toll Bridge Company Limited (an SPV to operate and maintain the DND Flyway connecting Delhi with Noida) ; Financial Services * IL&FS; Financial Services Limited (Investment Banking Arm of IL&FS;) * IL&FS; Investment Managers Limited (domestic private equity fund management) * ORIX Auto Infrastructure Services Limited (services related to transport finance and transport infrastructure) * IL&FS; Trust Company Limited - ITCL (services: debenture and bond trusteeship, trusteeship and investor representative for securitised paper, services as security trustee and facility agent, secure document management, scanning, processing and records management, and paralegal services) ;Technology Services *IL&FS; Technologies Ltd. (IT Arm of IL&FS; group) Projects IL&FS; has several projects in different sectors including Transportation, Area Development, e-Governance, Health Initiatives, Cluster Development, Finance, Power, Ports, Water and Waste Water, Urban Infrastructure, Environment, Education, and Tourism. In 2009, it became the new promoter of the Maytas Infra Ltd. and in January 2011, Maytas Infra was taken over by IL&FS; and renamed to IL&FS; Engineering and Construction Company Limited In September 2009, it picked up a \\"significant minority stake\\" in the Reliance Industries' special economic zone project in Haryana. IL&FS; was the principal lender behind the construction of the 9.28 km long Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee Tunnel, located on the route of NH 44 in Jammu and Kashmir. Its work was started in July 2011 and the tunnel was opened for traffic after its inauguration by the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi on 2 April 2017. Built on an estimated budget of ‚Çπ3,720 crore (US$550 million), the main tunnel is 13 metres in diametre, while the parallel escape tunnel is 6 metres in diametre. The main and escape tunnels are connected by 29 cross passages located at intervals of every 300 metres. It is the first tunnel in India with a fully integrated tunnel system and is expected to reduce the distance between Jammu and Srinagar by 30.11 km (18.7 mi), reducing the travel time by two hours. IL&FS; also has large investments in its own subsidiaries, as well as in the equity market. In September 2018, these amounted to nearly ‚Çπ10,000 crores. Ownership As of March 2018, the largest shareholders of IL&FS; Investment services were as follows Defaults on bonds by IL&FS; financial services From July to September 2018, two out of IL&FS;'s 256 subsidiaries reported having trouble paying back loans and inter corporate deposits to other banks and lenders, resulting in the RBI requesting its major share holders to rescue it. In July 2018, Hindu Businessline reported that the road arm of IL&FS; was having difficulty making payments due on its bonds. In the same month, Business Standard reported that its founder Ravi Parthasarathy would be leaving the firm due to medical reasons, after having headed the firm for 30 years. In early September 2018, Moneylife India reported that one of IL&FS;'s subsidiaries had been unable to repay a ‚Çπ1,000 crore short-term loan taken from SIDBI, resulting in SIDBI asking one of its officers to resign. Subsequently, Bloomberg Quint, Business standard and Economic times reported that one of the IL&FS; group of companies called IL&FS; Financial services limited had defaulted on its commercial paper payments. This led to news of a possible audit by the Reserve bank of India. IL&FS; Financial Services Ltd., one of the group's many financial subsidiaries had defaulted on repaying about ‚Çπ450 crore worth of inter-corporate deposits to Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI). On 27 September 2018, IL&FS; Financial services informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that it had defaulted on a ‚Çπ52.4 crore repayment of short-term deposits and ‚Çπ104 crore term deposit. However, in its replies to investors and the BSE, IL&FS; investment services (IVC) clarified that the news items did not relate to it, as these were two completely different legal entities. A similar letter was published by IL&FS; Transportation. On 1 Oct 2018, the Government of India took steps to take control of the company and arrest the spread of the contagion to the financial markets. A new board was constituted as the earlier board was deemed to have failed to discharge its duties. The new board consisted of Kotak Mahindra Bank managing director Uday Kotak, former IAS officer & Tech Mahindra boss Vineet Nayyar, former Securities and Exchange Board of India chief G N Bajpai, former ICICI Bank chairman G C Chaturvedi, former IAS officers Malini Shankar and Nand Kishore. The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) started an investigation as there were huge procedural lapses and top management was not reachable. Newspapers reported the lavish salaries management had given itself at the expense of public money. In the absence of adequate supervision by the RBI or shareholders or any claw back provisions on remuneration, the management treated the company as its fiefdom. On 2 April 2019, the SFIO arrested the former vice-chairman of IL&FS;, Hari Sankaran, in Mumbai for fraud and causing wrongful loss to the troubled infrastructure lender. He was accused of granting loans to entities that were not credit-worthy or declared as non-performing accounts causing loss to the company and its creditors. The SFIO was granted custody of Sankaran till 4 April. The initial SFIO probe revealed that there were major lapses in Deloitte's audit of the IL&FS.;SFIO probe finds several lapses in Deloitte audit of IL&FS; Financial Services, says reportGovt may ban Deloitte over allegations of fraud in IL&FS; audit The Government had moved to ban Deloitte for its role in the default. However, the Bombay High Court passed an interim order to prevent \\"coercive action\\" by the Government against the firm. In April 2020 the Indian Government's Corporate Affairs Secretary, Injeti Srinivas, said he expected to recover a substantial part of the company's ‚Çπ94,000 crore debt. He said it was strange that nobody foresaw the problem, whether it was statutory auditors, independent directors and credit rating agencies. On 8 June 2020, IL&FS; has concluded sale of its stake in GIFT City for 32 crore equity value. The sale would reduce its consolidated debt by more than 1,200 crore.

Early life Richard George Howard Joseland was born on 14 January 1860 at Claines, Worcestershire, England, the son of a wine merchant. In the early days of his career, he was articled to the Haddon Brothers at Hereford, but moved to London in 1881. There, he obtained a position as assistant to George Robinson in the architectural company George Trollope and Sons. In time, his health suffered as a result of overwork, and he was advised to migrate to a more temperate clime. He went to New Zealand, where he worked on the railways for six months. He then moved to Sydney, Australia, in 1888, where he married Alice Taylor. Career in Australia In Sydney, Joseland met Walter Liberty Vernon, another English architect who had migrated to Australia for health reasons. The two architects joined forces and entered a competition to design a model suburb. It was the first of several projects they would work on together. In 1890, Vernon became New South Wales Government Architect, as a result of which he handed his private practice over to Joseland. Joseland had relatively little work during the Depression of the 1890s; to make things even worse, his wife Alice died in 1891. In 1897 Joseland married Blanche Hay. His practice also began to recover with commissions in 1898. In 1903, he took on Hugh Vernon‚Äîa son of Walter Vernon‚Äîwho had been Joseland's pupil. The practice took on a variety of commissions, including commercial buildings, but Joseland's clientele was predominantly well-off people who required comfortable homes. Many of them were moving into the new residential areas in Sydney's north, where suburbs like Wahroonga and Warrawee developed. Joseland is credited with designing something like nineteen homes in these areas. His output included his own home, Malvern, which he built in 1900 in Burns Road, Wahroonga. He designed it in the Federation Bungalow style, featuring a prominent veranda to create shade. From 1914 to 1919, Joseland conducted a solo practice before joining forces with Glynn Gilling, another young English architect who had migrated to Australia. Joseland retired in 1929, selling the business to Gilling, who retained the business name Joseland and Gilling. Joseland was active in various community activities and musical societies, as well as being a keen fisherman and author of the book Angling in Australia and Elsewhere, which was published in 1921. He also found time to visit England twice with his wife Blanche. He died of cancer in the eastern Sydney suburb of Darlinghurst on 20 July 1930, and was buried at South Head Cemetery in another eastern Sydney suburb, Vaucluse. Influence Joseland was one of the earliest architects in Australia to reject the Victorian architectural styles that had developed in England and which had little relevance to the Australian climate. He wrote a magazine article, Domestic Architecture in Australia (published in 1890), in which he advocated architectural styles that were suitable for the local climate. Like Walter Liberty Vernon, he favoured the styles of the Federation era (1890-1915) and actually contributed to the development of the Australian version of the Queen Anne style, which ultimately became the most popular residential style in Australia in the first decade of the 20th century. This latter style had arrived in Australia in 1885 with the construction of Caerleon, Bellevue Hill;The Federation House, Hugh Fraser (New Holland) 2002, p.24 its influence can be seen strongly in the homes Joseland designed for his clientele, along with the Arts and Crafts style that was also popular.
