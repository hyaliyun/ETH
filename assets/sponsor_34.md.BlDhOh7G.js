A left-handed pitcher, his career extended for 11 seasons (1946‚Äì56), including a full season (1952) and parts of three others in Major League Baseball as a member of the Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates and Detroit Tigers. Nicknamed \\"Bullet Bob\\", Schultz stood tall and weighed . The native of Louisville, Kentucky, served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. Schultz came to the Major Leagues at age 27 after posting seasons of 20, 16 and 25 victories in minor league baseball. His 25-win season in 1950 was especially noteworthy as it came with the Nashville Vols of the Class AA Southern Association, who played their home games in a hitter's paradise called Sulphur Dell. Schultz lost only six decisions and finished second in the league in earned run average (2.68), just one one- hundredth of a point behind ERA champion Marv Rotblatt (2.67).Wolff, Miles, and Johnson, Lloyd, eds., The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball, 3rd edition. Durham, North Carolina: Baseball America, 2007 Schultz broke camp with the 1951 Cubs out of spring training and appeared in 17 games ‚Äî ten as a starting pitcher ‚Äî during the season's early months, but he was sent back to the minors after his last start July 13, when he was knocked out of the box after only one full inning in a start against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Schultz spent the entire 1952 campaign with the Cubs, working in 29 games and winning six of nine decisions. In his finest outing, September 14 at Braves Field, Schultz pitched a ten-inning complete game victory over the Boston Braves, allowing only two runs and six hits ‚Äî and winning the game for himself with an RBI double. It would be his ninth and final victory in Major League Baseball. In 1953, Schultz began the season with the Cubs but pitched infrequently and was included in a blockbuster trade to the Pirates on June 4 that netted the Cubs seven-time National League home run king Ralph Kiner. But he dropped all four MLB decisions that year, and spent part of the season, and all of 1954, with the Double-A New Orleans Pelicans. Back in the Southern Association, he won 27 games for the Pelicans over a season and a half, going 18‚Äì11 in 1954. The Tigers purchased his contract, but used him in only one game in 1955, in relief on April 15 against the Cleveland Indians. He surrendered three runs, all earned, on two hits and two bases on balls in 1 innings, and was sent back to the minors. He retired after the 1956 season. As a Major Leaguer, Schultz allowed 179 hits and 125 bases on balls in 183 innings of work, with 67 strikeouts. In the minors, he posted a 128‚Äì99 record in 345 games. Settling in Nashville, Schultz became a house painter and continued to play semiprofessional baseball as well as softball. He was shot to death at age 55 after becoming embroiled in a late-night argument with another patron, 59-year-old Charles Johnson, in the bar of Nashville Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 3595. He was interred at Nashville National Cemetery.

Plot The plot is based on a tradition that Sappho, a poet of ancient Greece, threw herself from the high Lesbian cliffs into the sea when she found that her love for the youth Phaon was unrequited, and that he preferred her maid, named Melitta in the play, to her. Background Following the success of his first great tragedy of fate, Die Ahnfrau (The Ancestress), which was written in 16 days, Franz Grillparzer wrote this second poetic drama, Sappho, also composed at white heat, and resembling Die Ahnfrau in the general character of its poetry although differing from it in form and spirit. In its conception, Sappho is half way between a tragedy of fate and a more modern tragedy of character; in its form, too, it is half way between the classical and the modern. An attempt is made to combine the passion and sentiment of modern life with the simplicity and grace of ancient masterpieces. Its classic spirit is much like that of Goethe's Torquato Tasso; Grillparzer unrolls the tragedy of poetic genius, the renunciation of earthly happiness imposed upon the poet by her higher mission.

Founded in 1832, the parish has occupied several different buildings as the population of English-speaking Catholics, primarily Irish, in Quebec City has swollen and shrunk. History The first Mass for Irish immigrants in Quebec City was celebrated in 1819; before St. Patrick's was established as a parish the Irish were allowed use of Notre Dame Basilica and Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church in Place Royale for their services. English-speaking Catholics in the city were organized into a separate congregation with a dedicated priest in 1822. Father Patrick McMahon was the priest of congregation from 1822‚Äì25 and again after 1828. McMahon raised the money for a separate church and lobbied the French-speaking Church Wardens. The first St. Patrick's was built on Rue Ste. Helene, on what is now McMahon Street (named after Father Patrick) inside the walls of the old city. Designed by Thomas Baillarge it opened for worship on July 7, 1833, and was enlarged in 1876. This church was replaced by a larger church on the Grand All√©e in 1914, but the old church continued to be used occasionally until 1967. It burned in 1970 and its outside facade was reused as part of an annex of the H√¥tel-Dieu de Qu√©bec hospital. The 1914 church was used until it was demolished in 1988.

Yakee A Dangerous Liaison (born 6 September 1999), also known as Danny, is a Pekingese, who was the winner of the title of Best In Show at the Crufts in 2003. He had previously been Reserve Best in Show at the competition in 2002. Following his victory, he was accused of having undergone a cosmetic procedure, which supposedly turned out to be an exploratory surgery for tonsillitis. A documentary broadcast in 2008, \\"Pedigree Dogs Exposed\\" later revealed that Danny had in fact undergone surgery due to a serious inherited disorder, exacerbated by conformation to breed standards. Show career Danny began his conformation show career at the age of three months, winning nine Best in Show titles prior to Crufts in 2003. In 2002, he won a Golden Bone Award for his work as a show dog. In 2003, he was named Best in Show at Crufts, with the Kerry Blue Terrier, Torums Tunde Bayou, named Reserve Best in Show. Torum Runde Bayou was the younger brother of previous Crufts champion Torums Scarf Michael, who had won Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show earlier in the year. The other finalists were Penling By Design At Namkia (a standard Poodle), Mistweave Making Waves (Greyhound), And I'm Great To Be Back (Newfoundland), Hamble Huckleberry (Bearded Collie) and Inkwells Named Shadow (Flat Coated Retriever). Danny had won the Toy Group twice in previous years, and in 2002 was Reserve Best in Show at Crufts, being beaten by Nord Ch. Topscore Contradiction. The 2003 Crufts competition was Danny's last, as he was retired from conformation showing following his win. During the awards ceremony, Danny needed to be cooled down with an ice pack in order to prevent him from overheating. This point was later used in the BBC One documentary special Pedigree Dogs Exposed to highlight issues with the breed. Following the win, an anonymous informant informed the Kennel Club that Danny had previously undergone cosmetic surgery (banned under conformation show rules). An investigation was conducted and the information turned out to be incorrect, with the operation claimed to have been an exploratory surgery due to persistent tonsillitis. His owners explained at the time of the accusation, \\"Danny had a bad infection in his throat which affected all his insides and wouldn't clear up with antibiotics. We took him to the vet school in Glasgow and he had an operation on his throat. But it didn't affect what he looks like\\". A letter to the Kennel Club from the University of Glasgow indicated that the surgery was for a resection of the soft palate and laryngeal saccules to relieve an upper airway obstruction. Pedigree Dogs Exposed reported on the cosmetic surgery allegations but stated that the operation was legitimate medical surgery. Ofcom later found against the television show for not allowing the Kennel Club a chance to respond to the implied cover-up of the operation on air. Although Danny did not participate in the breed competitions at Crufts after his Best in Show victory in 2003, the Yakee kennel continued to be successful in subsequent years, winning Best of Breed for the Pekingese in 2004 and 2005. One of Danny's sons, Yakee If Only, became the number one ranked dog in America in 2005 having won 64 Best in Show titles and the Toy Group on 128 occasions in a variety of shows.

Censorship can range from the complete government-enforced legal prohibition of a musical work, to private, voluntary removal of content when a musical work appears in a certain context. Motivations Decency Songs are often edited for broadcast on radio and television to remove content that may be considered objectionable to an outlet's target audience‚Äîsuch as profanity, or references to subjects such as sex and drug usage. This is typically done to comply with any relevant broadcast law or codes of conduct, and to make the songs more marketable to a mainstream audience. Songs edited for content in this manner by are often referred to as a \\"clean version\\" or a \\"radio edit\\" (the latter also referring to songs that may be edited for length on radio airplay‚Äîa practice which dates back to the space limitations of 45 RPM vinyl records). Common editing techniques include distorting vocals to obscure offending words (including muting, bleeping, and backmasking), or replacing them with alternative lyrics. The amount of censorship required may vary between broadcasters, depending on standards and practices and their target audience; for example, Radio Disney imposes stricter content guidelines than conventional U.S. radio stations, as it primarily targets a youth audience and family listening. By contrast, some radio stations may relegate unedited versions of tracks containing objectionable content to airplay during time periods deemed appropriate, such as late-night hours. Joel Mullis, an Atlanta sound engineer who became well known in the industry for his work on radio edits, noted that his job was often complicated by differing standards between broadcasters (such as BET and MTV), requiring different edits to meet their individual needs. Mullis' edit of the Ying Yang Twins' \\"Wait (The Whisper Song)\\" was constructed by splicing in vocals from other Ying Yang Twins songs, but Mullis eventually had to bring the group back to his studio after facing demands for additional edits. In some cases, a record label may choose to withhold a release entirely if they believe that its subject matter would be too controversial; Ice-T and Paris both had gangsta rap albums withheld or indefinitely delayed by Warner Bros. Records over content concerns, with Ice-T's Home Invasion delayed due to the 1992 Los Angeles riots and controversy over \\"Cop Killer\\"‚Äîa song by Ice-T's metal band Body Count, and Paris's Sleeping with the Enemy over its songs \\"Bush Killa\\" and \\"Coffee, Doughnuts, & Death\\". Insane Clown Posse faced similar issues after they signed to Disney-owned Hollywood Records; despite compliance with the label's demands to censor specific songs and lyrics, The Great Milenko was recalled almost immediately after its release (but not before selling 18,000 copies out of 100,000 shipped). All three acts moved to different labels (including Priority Records and Island Records), which released their respective albums without objections.  Notable examples  Multiple edits of CeeLo Green's song \\"Fuck You\\" exist, including one which changed the titular lyric to \\"Forget You\\", and one which muted \\"fuck\\" without replacing it. Green also performed a parody of the song about Fox News in an appearance on The Colbert Report. The Black Eyed Peas re-wrote \\"Let's Get Retarded\\"‚Äîa song from their album Elephunk, as \\"Let's Get It Started\\" to serve as a promotional song for television coverage of the 2004 NBA Playoffs. \\"Let's Get It Started\\" was subsequently released as a standalone single, and reached 21st place on the Billboard Hot 100. When performing his song \\"Power\\" on Saturday Night Live, Kanye West similarly replaced a verse of the song containing profanities and criticism of the program itself (\\"Fuck SNL and the whole cast\\") with newly-written lyrics. Songs containing potentially objectionable double entendres or mondegreens have also been subject to censorship. For example, the title and chorus of Britney Spears' single \\"If U Seek Amy\\" was intended to be misheard as \\"F-U-C-K me\\"; her label issued a radio edit which changed the word \\"seek\\" to \\"see\\", in order to remove the wordplay. Similar concerns were raised by radio stations over The Black Eyed Peas' \\"Don't Phunk With My Heart\\" upon its release, as the word \\"phunk\\" (a deliberate misspelling of \\"funk\\") could be misinterpreted by listeners as sounding like the word \\"fuck\\". This resulted in the label issuing an edit that changed the word to \\"mess\\". Meghan Trainor recorded an alternate version of her debut single \\"All About That Bass\\" for Radio Disney and conservative adult contemporary stations, which removed the song's suggestive metaphors. Censorship of music is not limited to lyrical content; MTV edited the M.I.A. song \\"Paper Planes\\" to replace sounds of gunfire in its chorus with alternative sound effects, and remove a reference to cannabis. Similar sound edits occurred when M.I.A. performed the same song on Late Show with David Letterman (broadcast by then-corporate sibling CBS). M.I.A. subsequently criticized both MTV and Late Show for censoring her song.  Criticism  Some listeners have expressed dissatisfaction over the editing of songs for radio airplay, arguing that it compromises the artistic integrity of the original song, and encourage listeners to seek out alternative platforms that are not subject to such censorship, such as digital streaming. At the same time, edits are considered a necessary concession to receive the radio airplay that can influence a song's overall performance. N.W.A.'s debut album Straight Outta Compton (which had attracted controversy for its song \\"Fuck tha Police\\") contains a song entitled \\"Express Yourself\\", which criticizes radio censorship of music as inhibiting free expression, as well as rappers releasing clean, inoffensive songs in an effort to target mainstream radio airplay. \\"Express Yourself\\" is the only song on the album to not contain profanities.  Sensitivity  Some songs may be pulled or downplayed by broadcasters if they are considered to be inappropriate to play in the aftermath of specific events. After the September 11 attacks, program directors of the radio conglomerate Clear Channel compiled an internal list of \\"lyrically questionable\\" songs, which included various songs with themes related to war, death, destruction, flight, or New York City, and all songs by Rage Against the Machine. Slate noted several unusual choices on the list, including \\"Walk Like an Egyptian\\", two Cat Stevens songs (Stevens had converted to the Islamic faith and changed his name to Yusuf Islam), and John Lennon's \\"explicitly pacifist anthem 'Imagine'\\". In the aftermath of the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in February 2003, Mark Wills' \\"19 Somethin'\\" was temporarily pulled by some radio stations as it contains a lyric referencing the Challenger disaster. Also that month, Madonna's then-upcoming music video for \\"American Life\\" generated controversy due to its politicized and \\"unpatriotic\\" imagery (such as a fashion show featuring women dressed in military equipment, and a scene where the singer throws a grenade-shaped lighter to a George W. Bush lookalike to light his cigar), which were considered to be especially sensitive in the wake of the Iraq war. Due to the negative response, Madonna pulled the video prior to its planned premiere, as she did not want to \\"risk offending anyone who might misinterpret the meaning of this video\\". In 2006, after Gary Glitter was convicted of child sexual abuse in Vietnam, the National Football League banned the original recording of his song \\"Rock and Roll\\" (which was popularly played at U.S. sporting events) from being played at its games. While the NFL still allowed a cover version of the song to be played, in 2012 the league instructed its teams to \\"avoid\\" playing the song entirely, following negative reception from British media over its continued use by the New England Patriots, and the possibility it could be played during Super Bowl XLVI. In 2009, after Chris Brown alleged physical altercation with his then-girlfriend Rihanna, various radio stations began to voluntarily pull Brown's music from their playlists as a condemnation of his actions. In December 2013, HMV removed the entire catalogue of Lostprophets from its stores after the band's lead singer Ian Watkins was charged with thirteen sexual offences against children. In late-2018, Cleveland radio station WDOK pulled \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\"‚Äîa 1944 pop standard synonymous with the Christmas season‚Äîfrom its Christmas music playlist, citing that certain interpretations of the song's subject matter were too sensitive in the wake of the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault. The move prompted other broadcasters (including two of Canada's major commercial radio groups, and the state-run CBC Radio) to follow suit. The decision was divisive among critics and the general public, with supporters arguing that the song's possible implications of date rape did not align with current societal norms, and others arguing that the decision was an appeal to political correctness. The CBC later reversed its decision, while a poll conducted by San Francisco radio station KOIT had only 23% of participants objecting to the song. In March 2019, some radio stations (particularly those of Cogeco in the Canadian province of Quebec, and Radio New Zealand), began to pull the music of Michael Jackson from rotation in response to the Channel 4/HBO documentary Leaving Neverland, which featured allegations by Wade Robson and Jimmy Safechuck that Jackson had sexually abused them as children. Cumulus Media stated that it had allowed its stations to make decisions on this matter on a case-by-case basis.  Legal issues  Songs and albums may, in some cases, be censored due to copyright problems (particularly related to sampling) or other legal issues. The JAMs album 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?) was withdrawn from distribution following complaints by ABBA, whose music was sampled on the album without permission.Brown, J., \\"Thank You For The Music\\", New Musical Express, 17 October 1987. The Notorious B.I.G.'s album Ready to Die was similarly pulled following a lawsuit by Bridgeport Music over unauthorized samples. By request of Atlantic Records, parody musician \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic did not commercially release \\"You're Pitiful\\"‚Äîhis parody of James Blunt's song \\"You're Beautiful\\", even though Blunt himself had approved of the satire. It was subsequently released as a free single online instead.  By country   Australia  The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and the Australian Music Retailers Association (AMRA) maintain a self-regulatory system known as the \\"Recorded Music Labelling Code of Practice\\", which utilizes a three-tier ratings system for objectionable content in music recordings. \\"Level 1\\" applies to content of a \\"moderate impact\\" (including \\"infrequent aggressive or strong coarse language; or moderate-impact references to drug use, violence, sexual activity or themes\\"), \\"Level 2\\" for \\"strong impact\\" (\\"frequent aggressive or strong coarse language\\", or strong references to drug use, violence, sexual activity or themes), and \\"Level 3\\" for \\"high impact\\" content (graphic and high-impact references to drug use, violence, sexual activity or themes). The Level 3 classification was introduced in March 2003, and requires purchasers to be over the age of 18. The code bans the distribution or sale of any recording with material that exceeds Level 3 classification, which includes content \\"which promote, incite, instruct or exploitatively or gratuitously depict drug abuse, cruelty, suicide, criminal or sexual violence, child abuse, incest, bestiality or any other revolting or abhorrent activity in a way that causes outrage or extreme disgust.\\" Australian customs law also bans the import of any product that \\"describe[s], depict[s], express[es] or otherwise deal[s] with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults\\". In 2003, copies of an album by grindcore band Intense Hammer Rage were seized by the Australian Customs Service, and the three band members were each fined AUD$500 each for violating customs law. The violations centred upon the abhorrent subject matter of the album's artwork and printed lyrics; the albums had been manufactured in the United States by their record label, and imported into Australia for their distribution. The band criticized the seizure as being a dilution of freedom of speech. In May 1990, Nick Franklin, acting news director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio station Triple J, was suspended by the ABC's management after having played a portion of N.W.A.'s song \\"Fuck tha Police\\". The song had received airplay on the station for several months, but ABC Radio head Malcom Long requested that the song be given a \\"rest\\"; in the offending segment, Franklin discussed the song's vulgar lyrics and subject matter. In protest of the suspension, Triple J staff went on strike, and the station stunted by playing the N.W.A. song \\"Express Yourself\\" on a loop. The stunt ended after the ABC resolved the dispute and reinstated Long. The song was ultimately played 82 times in a row.  Canada  The Dire Straits song \\"Money for Nothing\\" was the subject of a ruling by broadcast self-regulators in Canada. In Canada, content broadcast by radio and television is self-regulated under the code of ethics of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters by a group known as the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC), which acts upon complaints submitted by the general public. The CAB Code prohibits radio broadcast of undue coarse language or sexually explicit material, nor content which glorifies violence. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) can intervene in more substantial cases. In 2011, the Atlantic panel of the CBSC, in response to a complaint against CHOZ-FM, ruled that the original version of Dire Straits' 1985 single, \\"Money for Nothing\\" violated the ethics code, because of its use of the word \\"faggot\\"‚Äîa homophobic slur. However, the CRTC called upon the CBSC to review the decision with a national panel, as it \\"elicited a strong public reaction and created uncertainty for private radio stations across the country.\\" In particular, the CRTC asked the CBSC to consider the overall context of the slur in relation to the rest of the song, as well as how the word was used at the time of the song's release. The CBSC overturned the ruling; while panellists agreed that the slur was inappropriate, it was considered to be satirical and non-hateful in context. It was also noted that lead singer Mark Knopfler had substituted the word himself with alternatives (such as \\"queenie\\") during live performances, which was considered an admission that his original choice in words was in bad taste. The CBSC stated that it was up to individual stations whether or not they would play the unedited version. The ruling and controversy were ridiculed by critics; veteran Canadian radio personality Alan Cross commented that the controversy made Canada look \\"silly\\", remarking that \\"I talked to people from the U.S. and the U.K. and they were like, 'What's wrong with you people? Don't you get it? It's a joke. It's a satire. You didn't understand the context?\\" National Post columnist Chris Selley described the CBSC's new ruling as a \\"comedy classic\\" and \\"colossal waste of time\\", explaining that \\"it's one thing for a censor to decide whether something is legitimately artistic; it's another for it to declare whether or not it enjoys the art, as if it somehow mattered.\\"  China  During the rule of Mao Zedong, \\"Yellow Music\\" became subject to criticism and censure, since the Communist Party of China saw Shanghai shidaiqu pop music as indecent, and critics saw the sentiments of love songs as appealing only to the petite bourgeoisie. The genre was also criticized over its connections to American jazz music, due to anti-American sentiment from the Korean War. This resulted in many artists associated with shidaiqu, including Li Jinhui (who had been credited as a leading figure in the genre) and Chen Gexin, being branded as \\"rightists\\" and persecuted. Shanghai pop was displaced by revolutionary music that promoted Maoism and other ideologies of the Communist Party. Many Shanghai artists fled to Hong Kong, where the genre reached its height in the 1950s until the late 1960s, when it was superseded by Taiwanese pop (Mandarin adaptations of Japanese enka songs) (and later by Cantopop). In 1966, Tian Han‚Äîwriter of the Chinese national anthem \\"March of the Volunteers\\"‚Äîwas imprisoned over his allegorical play Xie Yaohuan (which was critical of Mao's regime) in one of the opening salvos of the Cultural Revolution. His works were banned, leading to \\"The East is Red\\"‚Äîa song which glorified Mao's cult of personality, being used as the de facto national anthem at this time.Jones. Andrew F. [2001] (2001). Yellow Music ‚Äì CL: Media Culture and Colonial Modernity in the Chinese Jazz Age. Duke University Press. In contemporary times, musical works criticizing the Chinese government have also been subject to censure. Guns N' Roses' album Chinese Democracy was banned in the country, as its title track criticizes the Chinese government and contains references to the Falun Gong (a spiritual movement which is subject to persecution in China). The song \\"Legacy\\" on Pet Shop Boys' 2009 album Yes was changed to an instrumental for its Chinese release, as it contains the lyric \\"governments fall\\". In July 2017, it was reported that Justin Bieber had been banned from performing in the country, citing \\"a series of bad behaviours, both in his social life and during a previous performance in China, which caused discontent among the public.\\" China has historically condemned or banned any musician who publicly supports Tibetan independence or otherwise interacts with the Dalai Lama; in 2008, Bj√∂rk chanted \\"Tibet, Tibet\\" to the audience whilst performing \\"Declare Independence\\" during a concert in Shanghai. Zhou Heping stated that the song, which was not cleared by Chinese authorities, had caused \\"dissatisfaction among the broader Chinese audience\\". He described Bj√∂rk's case as an isolated incident, and denied that the Ministry of Culture was wanting to further restrict performances by Western acts in the country in response to the incident, since China wanted international musicians to perform there for the Summer Olympics. In 2013, German electronic music band Kraftwerk were denied entry visas over their intent to perform at a 1999 Free Tibet concert in Washington, D.C., which was cancelled due to inclement weather. Maroon 5 had concerts cancelled in the country after bandmember Jesse Carmichael posted a Twitter message for the Dalai Lama's 80th birthday, and Oasis concerts in China were cancelled after lead singer Noel Gallagher performed at a Free Tibet concert in New York City. In 2016, the Publicity Department banned Lady Gaga after she posted a video of her meeting with the Dalai Lama prior to a conference in Indianapolis. In July 2016, South Korean music and entertainment became subject to a voluntary boycott in China, in retaliation for its stationing of a THAAD missile defence system to protect against attacks by North Korea (which has diplomatic ties with China). K-pop groups, as well as soprano Sumi Jo, had performances cancelled in the country due to the sentiment. Share prices of S.M. Entertainment and YG Entertainment also fell, as South Korean entertainment companies had increasingly invested in China to take advantage of the Korean Wave. In November 2017, following the settlement of the THAAD dispute, Chinese media outlets began to ease their censure of Korean music. \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\" from Les Mis√©rables was pulled from Chinese music streaming services in the wake of the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests, as the song has been considered a protest song in Hong Kong. Iran Iranian singer Googoosh performing at Scotiabank Centre in Toronto, Canada. In July 1979 during the wake of the Iranian Revolution, supreme leader Ruhollah Khomeini banned all popular music, considering it corrupting to youth's minds. The ban prompted many Iranian musicians to move to the U.S. city of Los Angeles to pursue their careers and industry there instead. Female vocalists such as Googoosh were also targeted under the ban (although her works remained popular via the black market), and she subsequently refused to perform. The restrictions were relaxed in the years that followed, especially under reformist president Mohammad Khatami in the 1990s. Khatami also lifted bans on male pop groups (so they could perform in concerts marking the 20th anniversary of the Revolution), and began to authorize performances by female singers internationally, and to all-female audiences inside the country. In 2000, Googoosh was given authorization to embark on an international comeback tour. In 2005, president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad enacted a ban on western music from state-run broadcasters. The move came shortly after conductor Ali Rahbari had resigned from the Tehran Symphony Orchestra due to backlash over their performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 (the first time it had been performed in Iran since the Revolution). All music must be approved by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance; typically, authorized releases are limited to traditional Iranian folk, classical, and pop music. As some have faced government action for writing, producing, and performing unapproved music, many Iranian musicians do so as emigrants outside of the country. However, there have been thriving underground scenes in genres such as hip-hop and rock.  Israel  The German composers Richard Strauss and Richard Wagner have been considered controversial figures in Israel due to their associations with Nazi Germany, in addition to Wagner's displays of antisemitism towards the Jewish faith. Although the works of Strauss have since been performed in the country, concerts intending to perform the music of Wagner are often faced with resistance and protests. Despite this, local broadcasters such as radio stations have still played Wagner's music without controversy.  Malaysia  In Malaysia, a Muslim-majority country, local law prohibits radio stations from playing songs that are \\"offensive to public feeling\\" or \\"violate good taste and decency\\". References to LGBT topics were censored from Lady Gaga's \\"Born This Way\\" by local radio stations because homosexual acts are illegal in the country, while \\"Despacito\\" was pulled by Malaysia's state-owned radio stations following listener concerns over its \\"un-Islamic\\" lyrics. Concerts in Malaysia have also been subject to censorship to comply with the country's moral values; Avril Lavigne was instructed to not wear revealing clothing, jump, shout, or include any \\"negative elements\\" in a 2008 concert in Kuala Lumpur, Muslim citizens were initially banned from attending a Black Eyed Peas concert in 2009 due to its Guinness sponsorship, as alcohol is banned under Sharia law (the ban was lifted after Guinness agreed to cease advertising its involvement nor sell its products at the event), and Adam Lambert agreed to make changes to a 2010 concert due to concerns that he would promote \\"gay culture\\".  North Korea  Music of North Korea is typically limited to state-sanctioned performers and ensembles, whose propaganda music glorifies the regime's ideologies and the Kim dynasty. Foreign music, and older North Korean music that do not meet the government's standards, is generally banned. In July 2015, it was reported that Kim Jong-un had issued a directive calling for inspectors to destroy music CDs and cassettes containing prohibited content, as well as adding additional songs to the blacklist (such as the entire soundtrack of the historical drama Im Kkeok Jeong). Critics have argued that Kim Jong-un's regime was selectively becoming more open to having some Western influence over its culture, citing the inclusion of Western music (such as selections from the soundtrack of the film Rocky, and the song \\"My Way\\") and imagery in the July 2012 debut performance of the Moranbong Band‚Äîan all-female military ensemble with a relatively contemporary sound in comparison to previous military ensembles. In July 2015, it was announced that Slovenian band Laibach would perform in Pyongyang as part of celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the end of Japanese rule. It was the first ever rock concert in the country; the band stated that they planned to perform covers of traditional songs and selections from The Sound of Music.  Poland  In May 2020, Polish radio station Tr√≥jka (run by state broadcaster Polskie Radio) was accused of censoring \\"Tw√≥j b√≥l jest lepszy ni≈º m√≥j\\" (\\"Your Pain is Better Than Mine\\"), a song by Kazik Staszewski that is critical of the ruling Law and Justice party. The song was inspired by a controversy involving party leader Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski. who had visited the graves of his mother and twin-brother Lech Kaczy≈Ñski at a Warsaw cemetery, even though they were closed to the public due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. The song does not reference the party or Kaczy≈Ñski by name. When \\"Tw√≥j b√≥l jest lepszy ni≈º m√≥j\\" charted at number one on Tr√≥jka's weekly countdown on 15 May, the station subsequently suppressed the chart and all references to the song from its website. Station director Tomasz Kowalczewski accused the programme's host Marek Nied≈∫wiecki of having rigged the chart in favour of Kazik's song. Bartosz Gil ‚Äî who also works on the chart show ‚Äî alleged that Kaczy≈Ñski's claim was false, and accused him of specifically targeting the song. The following Sunday, Nied≈∫wiecki announced his immediate resignation from the station, and also threatened legal action against the broadcaster for false claims of fraud. On 16 May, Polskie Radio music head Piotr Metz revealed that, after the chart show aired, Kowalczewski had ordered him via text message to remove \\"Tw√≥j b√≥l jest lepszy ni≈º m√≥j\\" from the station's music library. Metz also resigned from the station. The station also faced threats of boycotts from members of the Polish music industry. Deputy Prime Minister Jadwiga Emilewicz argued that \\"artistic freedom should never be fettered in any way, even when the artist has a different opinion\\".  South Korea  Due to tense relations between Japan and South Korea following the end of Japanese rule, the Korean government imposed various restrictions on the importation of cultural works from other countries‚Äîlaws ostensibly meant to target Japan.‰∏≠ÊùëÁü•Â≠ê (Tomoko Nakamura) \\"ÈüìÂõΩ„Å´„Åä„Åë„ÇãÊó•Êú¨Â§ßË°ÜÊñáÂåñÁµ±Âà∂\\" (Control of Japanese popular culture in Korea) . Ritsumeikan University. March 2004. In September 1999, South Korea lifted its ban on live performances of Japanese music, but only in venues with a capacity smaller than 2000. In June 2000, it became legal to perform Japanese music in larger venues, and to sell music recordings originating from Japan. However, until January 2004, it remained illegal to sell recordings containing Japanese-language lyrics. It remains illegal to broadcast Japanese music over terrestrial radio and television in South Korea. To appeal to the country's conservatism, television broadcasters have sometimes pulled music videos from airplay for containing content they deem to be inappropriate, such as violent or sexually suggestive content. While Korea's three largest television networks‚ÄîKBS, MBC, and SBS‚Äîhave all banned videos at some point, the public broadcaster KBS is known for doing so more often due to its stricter content rules, which additionally ban songs that encourage inappropriate behaviour (especially among youth), or contain references to brand names or Japanese words. This results in some songs, such as Psy's \\"Gentleman\\" (which was banned by KBS for a scene in which the singer kicks over a traffic cone) being banned only by KBS, but still receiving airplay by other networks. In 2010, the Supreme Court of South Korea ruled that it was illegal under the National Security Act to possess music that praises North Korea, even if instrumental, as it constitutes an \\"enemy- benefiting expression\\".  United Kingdom  The Sex Pistols' \\"God Save the Queen\\" was banned by radio stations, and allegedly suppressed from being the number-one song in the UK, due to its criticism of the British government and monarchy. The telecommunications regulator Ofcom has the power to reprimand broadcasters for playing songs and music videos that breach its guidelines on harmful or offensive content pre-watershed. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) adopted the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) Parental Advisory label program; in July 2011, the BPI published guidance for use of the logo on digital streaming platforms. The BBC was historically known for censoring various songs from being played on its radio and television stations; from the 1930s through 1960s, the BBC had banned songs such as \\"Hold My Hand\\" for its religious references, pop arrangements of classical tunes (though barring \\"Sabre Dance\\" because it was \\"not a well-loved classic whose perversion we would be encouraging\\"), and during World War II, songs that were \\"slushy in sentiment\\", such as \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\", due to concerns that it would affect the morale of soldiers. \\"Mack the Knife\\" was also banned from airplay outside of The Threepenny Opera, as the BBC felt it would be offensive outside of the context of the play. The Kinks' \\"Lola\\" was briefly banned under the BBC's anti-product placement rules, as its lyrics contain references to the brand name Coca-Cola. In the midst of an American tour, lead singer Ray Davies flew back to London to re-record the offending lyric as \\"cherry cola\\". The Sex Pistols' 1977 single \\"God Save the Queen\\" was controversial upon its release, as it was critical of the British government and monarchy (among other things, referring to the United Kingdom as a \\"fascist regime\\"), and was released during the year of Queen Elizabeth II's silver jubilee. \\"God Save the Queen\\" was banned by the BBC and all independent local radio stations, but still peaked at #2 on the UK Singles Chart during the week of the official Jubilee celebration. It was alleged that the chart's rules were changed for that week only to exclude sales from record shops that sold their own records (in this case, Virgin), in a deliberate effort to prevent the controversial song from reaching the number-one spot and causing wider offence. The Frankie Goes to Hollywood song \\"Relax\\" generated controversy due to its suggestive lyrics; the chorus contained double entendres such as \\"when you want to suck to it\\" and \\"when you want to come\\", which were interpreted as being oblique references to oral sex and ejaculation respectively. On 11 January 1984, Radio 1 morning DJ Mike Read stopped the song on-air during a chart rundown to point out its \\"obscene\\" lyrics, and announced that he would no longer play the song during his show. The BBC subsequently restricted the song to evening airplay. When the band made statements in a Daily Express interview confirming the possibility of sexual connotations in the lyrics, the BBC banned \\"Relax\\" entirely. The ban only increased interest in the single, causing it to become the number-one song in Britain only two weeks later. In December 2007, BBC Radio 1 began to play a version of The Pogues' popular Christmas song \\"Fairytale of New York\\" that censored the words \\"faggot\\" and \\"slut\\" from one of its verses. The BBC cited concerns over the homophobic slurs as reasoning, despite the song having historically been played without censorship. The BBC reversed the decision after it was criticized by listeners, the band itself, and the mother of the song's featured vocalist Kirsty MacColl. Radio 1 controller Andy Parfitt argued that \\"While we would never condone prejudice of any kind, we know our audiences are smart enough to distinguish between maliciousness and creative freedom. In the context of this song, I do not feel that there is any negative intent behind the use of the words, hence the reversal of the decision.\\" As the song's subject matter was deemed too inappropriate for airplay pre- watershed, BBC Radio 1 played an edited version of Rihanna's song \\"S&M;\\" during the daytime hours, and referred to the song using the alternate title \\"Come On\\". As Rihanna objected to the censorship of the song's title, the BBC later compromised by referring to the song as \\"S&M; (Come On)\\". For the same reasons, Ofcom deemed the song's music video to be unfit for broadcast pre- watershed. After the 2013 death of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, \\"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\\" from the film The Wizard of Oz reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, as the result of a social media campaign celebrating the death of the controversial PM. BBC Radio 1 did not play the full song during The Official Chart programme, and instead played a short snippet accompanied by a Newsbeat report about the campaign. The action led to complaints that the BBC were deliberately censoring the song due to its negativity in this context, noting that Notsensibles' \\"I'm in Love with Margaret Thatcher\\" (which also charted, as part of an effort to counter the \\"Witch\\" campaign) was played in full earlier in the show. The BBC Trust's Editorial Standards Committee upheld its decision not to play the song, due to its context as a celebration of Thatcher's death. \\"Liar Liar GE2017\\", a song released during the run-up to the 2017 general election that is critical of prime minister Theresa May, was not played by British radio stations due to broadcasting regulations in force during electoral campaigns, which forbid political advertising and require impartial coverage. Despite the suppression, the song still managed to reach #4 on the UK Singles Chart.  United States  The Parental Advisory label was voluntarily adopted by the U.S. music industry to designate recordings that may contain objectionable content. While music can be classified as a protected form of expression under the First Amendment, there have still been instances of voluntary censorship within the music industry, particularly in regards to protecting children from being exposed to age-inappropriate subject matter, corporate objections to an artist's work, and by radio and television stations to remain in compliance with the regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The 1978 Supreme Court case FCC v. Pacifica Foundation established that the FCC had the power to regulate the broadcast of content considered \\"indecent\\" on terrestrial radio and television. In 1985, the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), founded by Tipper Gore, published the \\"Filthy Fifteen\\"‚Äîa list of fifteen songs it deemed to be the most objectionable due to their references to drugs and alcohol, sexual acts, violence, or \\"occult\\" activities. The group pushed for the adoption of a ratings system, and for lyrics to be printed on the back covers of albums so they could be previewed by parents. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) opposed these proposals; during a Senate hearing on the matter in September, musicians such as John Denver and Frank Zappa argued that such guidelines would inhibit free expression. Zappa, in particular, argued that the PMRC's proposal for a method to \\"assist baffled parents in the determination of the 'suitability' of records listened to by 'very young children'\\" would reduce American music to \\"the intellectual level of a Saturday morning cartoon\\". Following the hearings, the RIAA introduced a standard Parental Advisory label (which took its current form, reading \\"Parental Advisory ‚Äî Explicit Content\\", in 1994 following subsequent hearings), which is designed to be applied to the cover art of songs and albums which contain \\"strong language or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse to such an extent as to merit parental notification.\\" The Parental Advisory label is a voluntary scheme; some retailers‚Äîparticularly Walmart‚Äîmade it a corporate policy to not stock any music release that carries the label. Gangsta rap generated controversies due to its often-provocative subject matter. \\"Fuck tha Police\\", a song from N.W.A.'s debut album Straight Outta Compton, proved to be especially controversial; the song criticized police brutality and racial profiling, and contained lyrics condoning violence against police officers. Civil rights activist C. Delores Tucker was also notable for her opposition to gangsta rap. She was known for distributing flyers outside record stores, as well as buying stock in media companies so she could protest the songs at shareholders' meetings. Tucker was notably dissed in other songs over her criticism of the genre, including Tupac's \\"How Do U Want It\\". Tucker sued Tupac's estate for emotional distress and slander over the song; the suit was later dismissed.Welte, Jim. Court rejects Tupac critic case . MP3.com: October 2, 2006. In 1990, Floridan political activist Jack Thompson targeted the Miami-based 2 Live Crew and their album As Nasty As They Wanna Be (which featured songs such as \\"Me So Horny\\"), claiming that it was obscene. In March 1990, the group filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court to overturn a Broward County ruling that declared the album obscene, but it was upheld by Judge Jose Alejandro Gonzalez Jr. In 1992, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the Gonzalez ruling, as the case presented insufficient evidence that the album met the definition of obscenity set by the Supreme Court (which includes a lack of artistic merit). The television channel MTV was also known for censoring objectionable content from music videos, and restricting some particularly-controversial videos to late-night airplay‚Äîsuch as The Prodigy's \\"Smack My Bitch Up\\" due to its violent imagery and misogynistic lyrics, and Sir Mix-a-Lot's \\"Baby Got Back\\" for its suggestive subject matter. Several Madonna videos have also been banned by the channel, including the sexually-explicit \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"Erotica\\". Due to its violent content, MTV and sister channel VH1 only played \\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\\" once in late-night hours for its world premiere, and refused to add it to their regular rotation. Madonna's label subsequently sought other outlets for the video: the women's cable network Oxygen aired it during its music program Daily Remix, AOL streamed it online, and it was released on DVD. On February 1, 2004 during the MTV-produced Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show (which was televised by its corporate sister CBS), Janet Jackson's breast was exposed by Justin Timberlake at the conclusion of the show, in an apparent \\"wardrobe malfunction\\". In response to the show, as well as other recent incidents surrounding unexpected uses of profanities during live television programs (fleeting expletives), the FCC launched a major crackdown against indecent material broadcast on terrestrial radio and television stations. Some rock radio stations removed or censored certain songs so they would not run afoul of the stricter enforcement, while MTV moved several videos with sexually suggestive imagery to late-night hours. As an immediate consequence of the halftime show controversy, Janet Jackson was blacklisted by CBS and MTV's parent company Viacom. Jackson's music was pulled from Viacom-owned television and radio outlets, and she was also removed from the 46th Grammy Awards being televised by CBS the following week‚Äîwhere Jackson had been scheduled to introduce a tribute to Luther Vandross. CBS also aired the ceremony under a five-minute delay in order to ensure that objectionable content was not seen during the telecast. The blacklisting caused Janet Jackson's album Damita Jo, which was released the following month, to underperform due to reduced promotion and single airplay. Vietnam During the era of the Vietnam War, popular music of South Vietnam, which was mainly associated with the Bolero genre, became colloquially known as yellow music, in opposition to red music endorsed by the Communist government of North Vietnam. After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, the music was banned altogether. Those caught listening to yellow music after North and South Vietnam were reunified would be punished, and their music would be confiscated and destroyed. Many South Vietnamese artists migrated to the United States, and continued to sing in exile. In 1986, the ban was lightened and love songs could be written again, but by then the music industry had ceased to exist. The government of the unified Communist Vietnam also prohibited the sale of overseas Vietnamese music, including variety shows like Asia and Paris by Night. In recent years however, bolero had grown popular again, as more overseas singers performed in Vietnam. Additionally, singing competition television series like Bol√©ro Idol have grown popular, with singers performing songs, including those formerly banned.

Grant ordered an assault on the Confederate heights at Vicksburg, Mississippi. The plan called for a storming party of volunteers to build a bridge across a moat and plant scaling ladders against the enemy embankment in advance of the main attack. The volunteers knew the odds were against survival and the mission was called, in nineteenth century vernacular, a \\"forlorn hope\\". Only single men were accepted as volunteers and even then, twice as many men as needed came forward and were turned away. The assault began in the early morning following a naval bombardment. The Union soldiers came under enemy fire immediately and were pinned down in the ditch they were to cross. Despite repeated attacks by the main Union body, the men of the forlorn hope were unable to retreat until nightfall. Of the 150 men in the storming party, nearly half were killed.

Biography He was the son of a ship carpenter and sparmaker. His birthplace and childhood home, Belfast, Maine, was located on the west side of Penobscot Bay, and the bay and harbor provided much opportunity for activity. His father died while Dudley was a boy, and his resulting situation in life required him to devote much of his time outside of school hours to manual labor on land and at sea, under the direction of an uncle. During this time he joined with some other high school boys in putting up a horizontal bar and other apparatus on the high school grounds, and they started a gymnastic club. They were additionally inspired by reports of exhibitions given at Bowdoin College, 60 miles away in Brunswick, and gave similar public exhibitions themselves at the town hall, and in towns nearby. In 1869, he was invited by Bowdoin College to direct the gymnasium there. Two years later he entered the College as a student, from which he graduated (A.B.) in 1875 and in 1878 received the degree of M.D. at Yale Medical School. During his time in the medical school, he was also an instructor in gymnastics at Yale College. After his graduation from Yale, he moved to New York City, where he conducted a private gymnasium for a year. He assessed the physical condition of clients using a physical examination and adapted an exercise regimen on various pieces of exercise equipment accordingly. From 1879 until his retirement in 1919, Sargent was director of the Hemenway Gymnasium at Harvard University. From 1879 to 1889 was assistant professor of physical training at Harvard. His nomination in 1889 for full professor was blocked by alumni on the Board of Overseers at Harvard who were annoyed about an 1885 ban the faculty athletic committee, of which Sargent was a member, had put on football. Although Sargent was accused of being opposed to football itself, the ban stemmed from ‚Äúrough play and fighting.‚Äù The athletic committee was founded in 1882, Sargent being a founding member, as a pioneering effort by Harvard to regulate intercollegiate competition. In 1881-1916 Sargent was director of the Normal School of Physical Training at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and after 1916 was president of its successor, the Sargent School of Physical Education. This school was for the training of teachers of physical education. In 1883, it found accommodations at 20 Church Street, and in 1904 in a new building on Everett Street. Initially, only women were taught; in 1904 the school was open to men as well. Sargent challenged the Victorian tradition of females prone to fainting, and encouraged freedom of dress and vigorous activity for girls and women. Sargent taught both German and Swedish gymnastics although at this time the two were competing in a ‚Äúbattle of systems.‚Äù In 1907-16, Sargent was president of the Health Education League. He married Ella Frazier Ledyard in 1881. They separated after a few years together, and had one child, Ledyard, who later continued his father's work. Sargent Center for Outdoor Education, owned by Boston University in Hancock, NH is named in honor of Dudley Sargent. Works He is the inventor of gymnasium apparatus, of the Sargent Anthropometric Charts, and published: * Universal Test for Strength, Speed and Endurance (1902) * Health, Strength and Power (1904) * Physical Education (1906) and numerous articles and papers on physical education.

In this arrangement, a Malay or Indonesian becomes the front person for a firm which is financed and run by a Chinese person (who may be a local citizen). Malaysia Ali Baba is a business practice in Malaysia, where a Malay company obtains a contract from the government-sponsored affirmative action system for the Bumiputera (the Malaysian New Economic Policy under Ketuanan Melayu) and subcontracts it to an ethnically Chinese- owned company.BBC News (2011-07-10): Malaysia‚Äôs ‚ÄòAli Baba‚Äô system causes ethnic tension by Jennifer Pak The ‚ÄúAli‚Äù, which is a typical Muslim name, refers to the Malay; the ‚ÄúBaba‚Äù the Chinese, from the Baba-Nyonya (Straits Chinese) people.The Star (2007-03-22): Malaysia‚Äôs ‚ÄòAli Baba‚Äô entente under strain by Haroon Siddiqui, quoting R.S.

Ali (a typical Muslim name) represents pribumi, while Baba (sometimes a collective name for peranakan Chinese), represents non-pribumi and is associated with Chinese Indonesians. Practice When this program was in effect, pribumi businessman was ordered to give training and responsibility to Indonesian workforce in order to hold staff position as government gave loan and licence to national private business. Government also gave protection in order to compete with foreign businesses. However, this program was ended in failure because less experience of 'pribumi' businessman, liberal system was in effect and less compete ability of 'pribumi' businessman. However, the core of this program, which in favor of native people, is resurfaced as new concept of putra daerah (which may be literally translated as \\"son of the land\\"), as autonomy system instated.

Only one was built, though it was well used. Design and development The Wanderlust glider was designed and built by T. E. Brown and K. W. Radburn, two employees of Miles Aircraft, immediately after World War II. It was a single-seat, all-wood, shoulder-wing aircraft, with a short span for a glider of though with an aspect ratio of over 15. The wing of the Wanderlust was built around a single spar, which with plywood skin around the leading edge formed a torsion box. Behind the spar the wing was fabric covered. There was 4¬∞ of dihedral and 2¬∞ of washout. The trailing edge was spanned with aerofoil section flaps, split into two equal sections. Inboard, these acted as simple flaps; outboard, additionally, as drooping ailerons. The two NACA airfoil sections used in the wing were chosen because they have centres of pressure that vary little with the angle of incidence, which increases when the flaps are deployed. The Wanderlust also had upper surface spoilers hinged on the wing spar at about quarter span. The rest of the Wanderlust was plywood skinned, with a cockpit which could be open or enclosed in a bubble hood. The fuselage tapered aft, with the tailplane mounted on top and the small fin behind it. The elevators, with individual trim tabs, moved either side of the fin and the rudder was hinged behind their trailing edges. Both elevators and rudder were horn balanced. The Wanderlust landed on a pneumatically-mounted central skid. Operational history Despite hopes of marketing the Wanderlust in finished and in kit form, only one was made. This was flown by many pilots including Lorne Welch. It was in at store at RAE Farnborough about 1970 and later donated to the Museum of Berkshire Aviation.

He began his career working on Middlesex Canal boats, selling fish and oysters in Boston. He never married. Career in Boston Brigham owned a restaurant on the corner of Hanover and Court Streets in Boston, Massachusetts, which he operated until it was sold in 1869 due to a street widening project. He was an astute and financially successful real estate investor. He chose not to run for any public office in Boston. Brigham was one of the founding directors of the Fitchburg Railroad and continued his work with the railroad until his death. Peter Bent Brigham died at his home at the northeast corner of Bulfinch and Allston Streets on Beacon Hill in Boston on 24 May 1877. He is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Legacy and endowments Brigham never married, and had no children. He regretted his lack of education, which motivated his bequests to improve the educational opportunities in his hometown of Bakersfield, resulting in the founding of Brigham Academy. The terms of his will also specified that $1,300,000 was to be spent 25 years after his death, for a hospital \\"for the care of sick persons in indigent circumstances\\". The money appreciated to $2,000,000 by 1902. It was used to establish the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, which opened in 1913, and became a world-renowned medical research hospital affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Brigham's nephew, Robert Breck Brigham (1826-1900), was also a restaurateur and successful businessman. He followed his uncle's example by endowing the Robert Breck Brigham Hospital to serve patients with arthritis and other debilitating joint diseases, which opened in 1914.

After a consultation process in 2003, involving 5,600 local residents, it was decided that a new acute hospital should be built to replace the ageing facilities at Stirling Royal Infirmary and Falkirk Royal Infirmary, which were to become community hospitals. At the time of construction the hospital was Scotland's largest ever NHS construction project, cost ¬£300 million to build, most of which was provided by a private finance initiative arrangement; it was built on the site of the old Royal Scottish National Hospital. Originally to be called Forth Valley Hospital, it was granted royal status by Queen Elizabeth II, becoming Forth Valley Royal Hospital. It was hoped the new hospital would be ready by 2009, but medical services did not start to be transferred until August 2010, when the first patients were admitted. The process was completed in June 2011, and the Queen officially opened the hospital on 6 July 2011. Facilities Set in of woodland, the hospital has 860 inpatient beds spread over four floors, 25 wards and 16 operating theatres. The wards contain a mixture of single rooms or a maximum of four beds per ward section, and each bed has access to a personal television screen free of charge. The hospital contains the region's only Accident and Emergency Department following the closure of the unit at Stirling Royal. The hospital provides services for the 300,000 residents of the Forth Valley area, stretching from Killin in the north to Bo'ness in the south. Those services include: *Cardiology *Dermatology *Diabetics *Dietetics *Ear, Nose and Throat *Gynaecology and Maternity *Mental Health *Neurology *Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery *Orthopaedics *Orthothotics *Paediatrics *Physiotherapy *Respiratory *Resuscitation Training *Rheumatology *Urology *Wound Management For the use of staff, patients, and visitors the hospital has several catering establishments including Starbucks, a Marks & Spencer Simply Food shop and cafe, and a full restaurant open seven days a week. The hospital's design was criticised for not providing space for the storage of medical files. It was expected that all files would be stored electronically within five years. In the meantime, the paper medical files were transferred to the site of the old Falkirk Royal Infirmary. An old X-ray department at the hospital was decontaminated and converted into a storage department at a cost of ¬£40,000, and a taxi company was contracted to move the records between sites. Radio Royal Radio Royal is the hospital radio service for the Forth Valley, broadcasting from studios at the Forth Valley Royal Hospital. It operates three radio stations - Radio Royal, Royal 2 and Royal Gold - all 24 hours a day seven days a week, staffed by a team of around 40 volunteers. Founded in 1976, it originally broadcast from the old Royal Scottish National Hospital in Larbert. It was latterly based at Falkirk Royal Infirmary, before returning to Larbert on the opening of Forth Valley Royal. Grounds The hospital is set in the grounds of the Old Larbert House estate, which until 2002 housed the Royal Scottish National Hospital, a state mental hospital. The 70 acres of land contain a loch, walled garden and woodland areas. The grounds were transformed into a \\"green oasis\\" for the use of those using the hospital and the local community with the help of a ¬£101,000 grant from the Forestry Commission Scotland. Forth Valley Royal is the first hospital in Scotland to have a Forestry Commission ranger on site. Tunnels were discovered during the hospital's construction, thought to have been built to allow wealthy guests staying at Larbert House, built in 1822, to walk to the nearby loch unobserved. Transport The hospital is accessible by public transport via bus services operating from the main local towns. A shuttle bus used to but no longer runs every 20 minutes from Larbert railway station, (it was free for passengers with a train ticket); the station is thus now a 25-minute walk away from Larbert train station. A large car park with 1,500 spaces is provided, free with a maximum stay of four hours. Bicycle racks are provided for those cycling to the hospital. Robotics Forth Valley Royal was the first hospital in the UK to use a system of robotic porters. A fleet of 13 robotic vehicles operates within the hospital, supplied and maintained by services company Serco, part of its 30-year contract to provide cleaning, catering, portering and maintenance services. The robots have their own corridor system and lifts underneath the hospital, and navigate using guidance lasers. They can be called up to wards by staff using a portable computer, and are used for tasks such as removing waste, delivering food to wards, and cleaning operating theatres. To avoid any risk of cross-contamination the fleet is divided into those robots performing \\"clean\\" tasks and those carrying out \\"dirty\\" tasks, each with their own network of corridors. The hospital also has Scotland's first fully robotic pharmacy, where robots dispense and label medicines. It is estimated that in reducing the number of errors and requiring less staff time the system, which cost ¬£400,000 to install, has cut the hospital's drug bill by ¬£700,000. Instead of completing prescription forms, staff on the wards order drugs via computer terminals.

Early life  Abang was illegally captured in Sarawak when he was about 1 year old. After being confiscated by authorities, he was taken with a female, Dayang, to England in 1967 and kept in Bristol Zoo.  Experiment   Aim and setup  The aim of the experiment was to teach an ape subject, through imitative learning, to use a stone to hammer a flake from a flint and use this flake as a tool to open a box. The experiment was divided into two stages where the subject was given demonstrations and then given the opportunity to do the activity him/herself. Stage-I's aim was tool-use, to get an ape to cut a cord to open a box, using a pre-made flake. Stage-II's aim was tool-making, to get an ape to make his/her own flakes and open the box with them. The demonstration and attempts were done with a sheet aluminum box. A mesh window made the food visible. The box had a lid secured by a cord inside the box, with the cord accessible via a slot.  Timeline  The experiment started in 1971. The experimental sessions were conducted in an indoor part of the ape‚Äôs cage, initially with both Abang and Dayang present. They proved to be a distraction to each other, thereafter only Abang was then used as a subject. Stage-I was conducted in 4 sessions from March 5 to March 19 with success starting at the end of the 2nd session. Stage-II was conducted in 7 sessions from March 23 to April 16 with success starting in the 6th session.  Conclusion  In the opinion of the researcher, while the experiment showed, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ a case of imitative learning it would be misleading to think of Abang‚Äôs behavior solely as parrot- fashion learning. ‚Ä¶ apes possess random exploratory activity and innovations which can lead to new successes.‚Äù  See also  *Animal intelligence *Chantek *List of apes *Tool use by animals  References   External links  * Orangutans' Intelligence Category:Primatology Category:Individual orangutans ","title":"Abang (orangutan)"},{"id":"32499578","text":"FC Blue Boys Muhlenbach, commonly known as Blue Boys Muhlenbach, is an association football club based in the Muhlenbach district of Luxembourg, the capital city of Luxembourg.

The physical finding of detrusor activity of insufficient strength or duration to ensure efficient bladder emptying is properly termed \\"detrusor underactivity\\" (DU). Historically, UAB and DU (as well as others such as 'bladder underactivity') have been often used interchangeably, leading to both terminologic and pathophysiologic confusion. Patients with underactive bladder have a diminished sense of bladder filling and consequently are often found to have DU as an underlying finding, however bladder outlet obstruction and less frequently volume hypersensitivity (\\"OAB\\") can be associated with UAB symptoms Causes Without diagnostic evaluation, the cause of underactive bladder is unclear, as there are multiple possible causes. UAB symptoms can accurately reflect impaired bladder emptying due either to DU or obstruction (normal or large storage volumes, elevated post-void residual volume), or can result from a sense of incomplete emptying of a hypersensitive bladder (small storage volumes, normal or elevated postvoid residual volume). UAB potentially might also result from inaccurate perceptions of bladder function, such as in neurologic or psychiatric disease. DU itself is often linked to a weak detrusor muscle (impaired contractility), however this association is weak. Both UAB and DU have been associated with diminished sensitivity to bladder volumes rather than objective detrusor weakness, suggesting both symptoms (UAB) and function (DU) have a significant component of sensory dysfunction, leading to impaired bladder sensations and control (Smith et al., 2015). The underlying contributors to UAB include neurologic disease, metabolic disease (e.g. diabetes), chronic bladder outlet obstruction (e.g. obstructive BPH or complications of anterior vaginal surgery), cognitive decline (such as with aging), psychiatric disorders, and adverse effects of medications. Additionally, structural abnormalities expanding the urinary reservoir beyond the bladder, such as massive vesicoureteral reflux or large bladder diverticulae, can result in UAB. While aging itself is often associated with UAB (and DU), there is scant evidence to support this claim. Diagnosis There is no standardized evaluation of the symptoms of UAB, in part due to the historic terminologic confusion. A thorough history aimed at detecting underlying disease or prior pelvic surgeries is certainly necessary. As a perception of volume mishandling, a voiding diary (to assess voided volumes and frequency of voiding) and a post-void residual volume would be valuable information. Uninstrumented uroflow, neurologic and pelvic examination may contribute valuable information. Imaging looking for abnormal bladder morphology or vesicoureteral reflux/hydronephrosis may be helpful. If low- pressure urine storage can be assured, and the urinary reservoir is known to be limited to the bladder, the general value of urodynamic study in UAB is unclear. In specific situations, invasive urodynamics may be helpful to distinguish bladder outlet obstruction from DU, although this distinction can be difficult. Treatment Therapy for UAB is often dependent on factors such as age, health, symptoms, and cause of the condition. Treatment frequently includes lifestyle modification (fluid restriction, bladder retraining). Bethanechol is a prescription medication used for treatment, bethanechol can stimulate the nerves of the bladder, making them more responsive to stimulus. With UAB, it is common for patients to utilize a urinary catheter to void. Surgical options are also options, with a cuff or stent placed around or in the neck of the bladder to aid the emptying and leakage of urine. Neuromodulatory techniques such as sacral nerve or posterior tibial nerve stimulation may be of value in selected cases. However, current therapies are considered inadequate and there is a strong need for new research and attention.(Van Koeveringe et al., 2011; Tyagi et al. 2015).

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Grimsargh, the archdeaconry of Preston, and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History A chapel was built on the site of the present church in 1716, and a north aisle and a chancel were added in 1840. Between 1868 and 1871 the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin carried out work on the church. They rebuilt the nave, providing seating for 220 people, and added a tower. This cost ¬£3,000 (), and was paid for by the Revd John Cross. Architecture Exterior The church is constructed in sandstone and has slate roofs. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave with a north aisle, a single-bay chancel, a north vestry, and a west tower. The architectural style is Decorated. The tower is in three stages, with a stair turret to the southeast and angle buttresses. In the top stage are three-light bell openings, and the tower is surmounted by a battlemented parapet and a pyramidal roof. Along the south side of the church are two-light windows and a gabled porch. The east window has three lights. In the wall of the north aisle are two-light square-headed windows.

Televerde generates its profits from Penal Labor. The company employs 425 women at five contact centers in the Arizona Department of Corrections and Indiana Department of Correction. On average these women are paid less than one dollar per hour for their work in Arizona and less than twenty-five cents per hour in Indiana. Using this business model, Televerde has generated more than $8 billion in revenue for its clients. History Televerde was founded in 1994 by Ronald Bell and Charles Monroe. James Hooker acquired the majority of the holding company, Pegasus Research Inc. in 1995 and served as president and CEO until he retired in November 2018. The company's business model began as a partnership with the Arizona Correctional Facility for Women (ACW). Its first headquarters was a former Best Western hotel located in Phoenix with five employees working in a single-wide trailer on the grounds of Arizona Center for Women. In 1998, the company moved to their current headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, and acquired IBM and Microsoft technology firms as their first two clients. In 2001, correctional resources transferred to the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADOC) at Perryville Correctional Facility and with this move, Televerde opened up two contact center locations within the facility - Santa Cruz and San Pedro units. In 2005, the Citrus contact center opened at Perryville, followed by the Lumley contact center in 2007. In 2009, the first sales development team was created at Televerde's corporate location. In 2012, another expansion added the Triumph contact center at Perryville. In March 2015, the Rockville Correctional Facility contact center opened in Rockville, Indiana. Global expansion began in May 2015. The Latin American (LATAM) headquarters opened in C√≥rdoba, Argentina, where the company originally white labeled through Affinitas, offering marketing and sales services branded as Televerde. The company then opened the European headquarters in Glasgow, Scotland in April 2016 followed by an Asia Pacific (APAC) office in Melbourne, Australia in November 2017.

A German-American church historian and historical theologian in the field of Reformation studies, Pauck's fifty-year teaching career reached from the University of Chicago and Union Theological Seminary, to Vanderbilt and Stanford universities. His impact was extended through frequent lectures and visiting appointments in the U.S. and Europe. Pauck served as a bridge between the historical-critical study of Protestant theology at the University of Berlin and U.S. universities, seminaries, and divinity schools. Combining high critical acumen with a keen sense of the drama of human history, in his prime Pauck was considered the Dean of historical theology in the United States. In the course of his career he became associated with Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich as friend, colleague, and confidant.Marion Pauck (1999). \\"Wilhelm Pauck: Church Historian and Historical Theologian 1901-1981 Pr√©cis of a Memoir,\\" in Journal for the History of Modern Theology / Zeitschrift f√ºr Neuere Theologiegeschichte 6(1), pp. 50-68. Biography Formative years in Germany After moving to Berlin with his family as a young boy, Pauck received a classical education (Greek, Latin, French, arithmetic, history, geography, science) at the Paulsen Realgymnasium in Berlin-Steglitz. Amid the pessimism and confusion of the First World War he became valedictorian of his class in 1920. Upon enrolling at the University of Berlin he intended to study history and philosophy, but his encounter with Karl Holl and Ernst Troeltsch caused him to turn to the study of the Reformation and to the history of theology.Marion Pauck, \\"Wilhelm Pauck,\\" JHMTh, p. 54. Through Karl Holl Pauck was introduced to the \\"Luther Renaissance,\\" which applied critical historical study to the work of the Reformer, while Troeltsch taught him how the sixteenth-century Reformation underwent reinterpretation in the modern world.Wilhelm Pauck, \\"Introduction,\\" to Karl Holl, The Cultural Significance of the Reformation, trs. by Karl and Barbara Hertz and John H. Lichtblau (Cleveland: The World Publishing Company, 1959), pp. 7-19. Two courses taken with Adolf von Harnack in Berlin impressed Pauck greatly. He also heard lectures by Karl Barth in G√∂ttingen prior to returning to Berlin to pursue his dissertation on Martin Bucer's reformation treatise, De Regno Christi. In G√∂ttingen he joined the German fraternity G√∂ttinger Wingolf.Mitgliederverzeichnis des G√∂ttinger Wingolf. Jahrgang 2007. p. 46. He received the degree of Licentiate of Theology, University of Berlin, August 31, 1925. As the leading candidate of the theology faculty Pauck was sent as an exchange student to Chicago Theological Seminary for the year 1925-26. When he returned to Germany, Holl had died and a chance for a teaching appointment in Berlin was negated. Pauck declined a chance to teach in K√∂nigsberg. Fortuitously, upon the death of the church historian Henry H. Walker in Chicago, Pauck was called back to Chicago, where he was named Instructor in Church History in 1926 and remained in America for the rest of his career. On April 15, 1928 he was ordained to the ministry in the Hyde Park Congregational Church.Marion Pauck, \\"Wilhelm Pauck,\\" JHMTh, pp. 50-68. Life as a German- American Having been educated in urban Berlin, Pauck experienced Chicago as a vibrant center of American life and culture. His genial and inquisitive nature made him an avid student of the U.S., both within the academy and in the larger world of politics, economics, and the arts. As a youth and university student he had witnessed the human grief and suffering that surrounded the First World War. He rejected the cultural pessimism espoused by Oswald Spengler in The Decline of the West (orig. German, 1918), because he knew persons in all walks of life who were affected by these tribulations but who remained unshaken in their spiritual roots. Alongside his Americanization Pauck never lost sight of the twentieth-century plight and horror that had seized his homeland with the rise of fascism and the Hitler state. In a speech given in 1939 at Chicago Theological Seminary, he stated: :I have detested this movement from that moment when it became clear to me that by its will to destroy the Christian foundations of Western civilization, it would lead Germany and the rest of the western world on the road to cultural ruin.Quoted in Marion Pauck, \\"Wilhelm Pauck: A Biographical Essay,\\" in Interpreters of Luther: Essays in Honor of Wilhelm Pauck, ed., Jaroslav Pelikan (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1968) p. 353. In the midst of ongoing crises of the 1930s-1940s Pauck remained anchored in the traditions of his 19th-century forebears, especially the thought of Goethe, whom he frequently cited from memory.Marion Pauck, \\"Wilhelm Pauck,\\" JHMTh, pp. 50-51. Pauck's life mediated between his native and his adopted culture. He became an American citizen on November 3, 1937. Academic career Chicago Theological Seminary and the University of Chicago When Chicago Theological Seminary appointed Pauck an instructor in 1926 he joined a growing and impressive list of scholars in the University of Chicago Divinity School, including Shailer Mathews, Shirley Jackson Case, William E. Dodd, John T. McNeill, Matthew Spinka and Charles H. Lyttle. In 1927,William W. Sweet, an American church historian joined the faculty and quickly befriended Pauck. Wilhelm Pauck married Olga Dietz G√ºmbel on May 1, 1928 and rose to the rank of full professor by age 30. His 1936 presidential address of the American Society of Church History was on \\"The Nature of Protestantism.\\"Heritage of the Reformation, pp. 165-182. In 1939 he was appointed Professor of Historical Theology, Chicago Theological Seminary and The Divinity School of the University of Chicago with an additional appointment being made to the Department of History in 1945. Beginning in Chicago and continuing in his later career Pauck served on numerous elected boards, historical and theological scholarly societies, and committees of the university and the divinity schools where he pursued his career.Marion Pauck, \\"Wilhelm Pauck,\\" JHMTh, p. 59. During the 1940s Pauck urged University President Robert Hutchins to invite refugee professors from Nazi Germany and was deeply involved with the refugee community of intellectuals and academics. In 1948-49 Pauck was an Exchange Professor at the University of Frankfurt and the University of Marburg, Germany and received the Goethe plaque from the city of Frankfurt.Marion Pauck, \\"Wilhelm Pauck,\\" JHMTh, pp. 64-65. Early on Pauck was troubled by the lack of attention that American liberal Protestantism gave to the theology of Karl Barth. In 1931, Pauck published Karl Barth: Prophet of a New Christianity? in an effort to defend Barth's critique of Protestant liberalism. While Pauck did support Barth's critique of liberalism he found Barth's lack of historical criticism troubling and could not defend Barth's attempt to confine God's revelation to the Bible. In later years Pauck emphasized that the title of this early book had ended with a question mark. Barth was angry at Pauck's critique but eventually came to regard him in friendly terms and suggested to him that he look at the theological ideals of Paul Tillich.Marion Pauck, \\"Wilhelm Pauck,\\" JHMTh, pp. 61-62. Union Theological Seminary, Vanderbilt and Stanford Universities Wilhelm Pauck was already familiar with Tillich when he met the young Privatdozent in Berlin in 1921. Despite Pauck's residing in Chicago, the two became good friends after Tillich came to New York in 1934. That friendship deepened when Pauck moved from Chicago to teach alongside Niebuhr and Tillich at Union Theological Seminary in New York in 1953. He had long been acquainted with east coast theologians through participation in The Theological Discussion Group, which met twice a year to reflect on theological and social- economic issues. Consisting of some twenty-five theological educators, the participant list included the layman Francis P. Miller, Henry P. Van Dusen, John C. Bennett, Roland Bainton, Robert L. Calhoun, Georgia Harkness, H. Richard Niebuhr, Reinhold Niebuhr, Paul Tillich, in addition to Pauck, who became the group's secretary.Heather A. Warren, \\"The Theological Discussion Group and Its Impact on American and Ecumenical Theology, 1920-1945, \\" Church History, Vol. 62 No. 4, Dec., 1993, pp. 528-543. As Professor of Church History (1953-1960) and as the Charles A. Briggs Graduate Professor Church History (1960-1967), Pauck brought to Union Seminary the same level of institutional engagement he had practiced for 27 years in Chicago. During this time Pauck's first wife, Olga Dietz G√ºmbel, died January 15, 1963, and on November 21, 1964 he married the Union Seminary alumna and former Oxford University Press religion editor, Marion Hausner. After reaching the age of retirement from Union Seminary, Wilhelm Pauck assumed the position of Distinguished Professor of Church History at the Vanderbilt University Divinity School (1967‚Äì72). His list of publications in this setting included the long-awaited book, Harnack and Troeltsch: Two Historical Theologians (1968). Following the Vanderbilt professorship he served as Visiting Professor in the Departments of History and Religious Studies at Stanford University from 1972 until his official retirement in 1976. Together Wilhelm and Marion Pauck planned a two-volume work on Tillich, of which Volume 1 would focus on Tillich's life and be written primarily by Marion, and volume two would focus on Tillich's thought and be written primarily by Wilhelm. The first volume, Paul Tillich: Life and Thought (New York: Harper & Row), appeared in 1976. The second volume, planned as Wilhelm Pauck's exploration of Tillich's roots in German thought, was not completed, mainly due to Pauck's failing health but also because Pauck's admiration of Tillich was mixed with severe reservations about his dependence upon the German philosopher Friedrich Schelling.Marion Pauck, \\"Preface,\\" From Luther to Tillich: The Reformers and their Heirs (San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1984) p. xi-xii. A significant initial section of Pauck's unpublished volume on Tillich's thought appeared posthumously in 1984 as \\"Paul Tillich: Heir of the Nineteenth Century.\\"From Luther to Tillich, pp. 152-209. In addition, a multi-authored volume, The Thought of Paul Tillich, published by Harper and Row in 1985, includes a poignant Tillich portrait by Pauck, entitled, \\"To Be or Not to Be: Tillich on the Meaning of Life.\\"The Thought of Paul Tillich, eds., James Luther Adams, Wilhelm Pauck, and Roger Shinn (New York: Harper and Row, 1985), pp. 29-43. The book chapter had been Pauck's last public address, given at New Harmony, Indiana, March 31, 1979. Teacher and educator Pauck's impact as teacher and educator was felt among colleagues as much as by his immediate students. A correspondence of 30 years with his Harvard colleague, James Luther Adams, is found among the Pauck papers at Princeton Seminary.Henry Luce III Library, Princeton Seminary, Princeton, New Jersey. http://libweb.ptsem.edu/collections/pdf/lucenewsspring2008.pdf Speaking in 1968 at the presentation of a Festschrift, his Divinity School colleague in Chicago, Lutheran theologian Joseph Sittler, described teaching as Pauck's \\"fabulous m√©tier.\\" Sittler stated further that :It is possible to say of very few men that they established a discipline in the American theological scene. . . . Now this discipline was not done by a detached career of scholarship ensconced within a university and principally engaged in research and writing; it was done in full engagement with students in classrooms and seminars. . . .Marion Pauck, \\"Wilhelm Pauck,\\" JHMTh, p. 60, n. 20. Pauck was especially noted for his ability to mediate the past as a lively classroom lecturer, seminar teacher, podium speaker, and panelist. In his teaching and lectures a telling anecdote would illumine the foibles and highpoints of the Christian past, while illustrating the human predicament generally and giving students courage to wrestle with similar issues in their own time and place. Though less well known than Paul Tillich and Reinhold Niebuhr, Pauck was often present during crucial points of their careers. Like them, he preferred undogmatic expressions of liberal Christianity to more orthodox teachings that fail to view the legacy of the church through the lens of history. Pauck had worked to unite the old German synod, the Evangelical and Reformed Church, with the Congregationalists, thus forming the United Church of Christ in 1957. An active proponent of the ecumenical movement in the 1940s, including conversations with Roman Catholic theologians, Pauck consulted on the World Council of Churches meetings in Amsterdam (1948) and Evanston(1954). Gradually his interest in such committee work yielded to his preoccupation with the historical significance and roots of Christianity.Marion Pauck, \\"Wilhelm Pauck,\\" JHMTh, pp. 66-67. Though it was not inhibiting, an element of literary perfectionism, plus dedication to the needs of institutions and graduate students, limited Pauck's publishing activity. Yet his influence occurred both through his teaching and his considerable writings. A partial list of twentieth-century Reformation scholars and historians of theology influenced by him would include the names of James Luther Adams, William A. Clebsch, John Dillenberger, B.A. Gerrish, Hans Hillerbrand, Jaroslav Pelikan, Joseph Sittler, and Lewis Spitz.See the contributors to the Pauck Festschrift, Interpreters of Luther. Historian and theologian Pauck had confidence in the significance of the past for the present, and came to regret elements of American culture that downplay the need for a sense of what is owed to our predecessors. From Goethe's Faust he took over the idea that \\"we must acquire knowledge of the past in order to possess it,\\" while the abiding lesson he took from Harnack was that of \\"overcoming history with history.\\"\\"Adolf von Harnack's Interpretation of Church History,\\" Heritage of the Reformation, pp. 337-351. For him the latter phrase meant that one cannot get around the fact that all human culture, including religion, is anchored in history and thus subject to new interpretations. As a result, only further study of history, not a flight from history, can be used to correct mistaken views of the past. He took something like the same idea from his sole intellectual hero, Ernst Troeltsch, who taught that religion and theology are thoroughly historical, even when they purport to transmit eternal verities.Marion Pauck, \\"Wilhelm Pauck,\\" JHMTh, p. 54 Like Adolf von Harnack, who knew that \\"one St. Francis has been more powerful than many of the princes of the church,\\" Pauck stressed the power of the individual in world history for which Martin Luther was a constant reminder.Adolf von Harnack, \\"Was wir von der r√∂mischen Kirche lernen und nicht lernen sollen,\\" Ausgew√§hlte Reden und Aufs√§tze (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1951), p. 68 Pauck maintained that, for the foreseeable future, Protestant Christianity would necessarily continue to define itself over against Roman Catholicism, and vice versa.\\"Roman Catholicism and Protestantism,\\" and \\"The Roman Catholic Critique of Protestantism,\\" in Heritage of the Reformation, pp. 211-230 and pp. 231-249. Although he sometimes seemed to be closer to Harnack than to Luther, his original respect for the Reformation remained intact.Marion Pauck, \\"Wilhelm Pauck,\\" JHMTh, 61. He criticized laissez-faire economic liberalism with its view of human autonomy, while viewing the task and challenge of theological liberalism to be that of preserving the fundamentals while adapting to new historical conditions. He held that :The major Christian writings, including the Bible and the works of the great theologians, have been analyzed or edited by means of reliable critical methods. . . . Indeed, this critical historical interpretation of the Christian tradition constitutes the permanent achievement of liberalism.\\"A Defense of Liberalism,\\" Heritage of the Reformation, p. 332. His essay on \\"Luther's Faith\\" captures the teaching instilled by Karl Holl and the \\"Luther Renaissance\\" that Reformation faith is first and foremost a religion of conscience. Agreeing with Karl Holl's book, The Cultural Significance of the Reformation,\\"Luther's Faith,\\" The Heritage of the Reformation, pp. 19-28; Karl Holl, The Cultural Significance of the Reformation. Pauck took issue with Reinhold Niebuhr's view of Luther as lacking a social impact, while he simultaneously accorded a place of honor to Troeltsch's teaching about the difference between the sixteenth-century Reformation and modernity.\\"Luther and the Reformation,\\" Heritage of the Reformation, pp. 14-15. On Karl Barth's neo-Reformation teaching overall, Pauck's view was appreciative as well as critical. In \\"An Exposition and Criticism of Liberalism,\\" a paper from 1935 that he revised in 1968, he wrote: :In his eagerness to assert the sovereignty of God and to recognize the act of God alone, . . . [Barth] even refuses to admit that there is a point of contact between God and man, that there exists a human possibility of arriving at the knowledge of God. . . . But this negation of human possibilities in the name of the 'totally other' God can actually be of little practical significance for the church and its work in the world. At the same time, Pauck stated that :This criticism of Barth's theology must not prevent us from a serious consideration of the protest which has called it into being. For Barth's whole thought is a violent outburst against modern civilization and its dependence upon the principle of the freedom and the self-determination of man. . . . He accuses modern Christians of having closed their eyes to the power of sin and evil, which again and again destroys the unity not only of individual persons and of social groups but also of the world. I think that Barth is justified in making this accusation.Heritage of the Reformation, p. 319. Pauck's \\"General Introduction\\" to his translation of Luther's Lectures on Romans shows how much the recovery of Reformation teaching owes to historical critical scholarship. The 1905 discovery of this manuscript in Berlin gave us the young Luther's most significant exegetical work, thus providing a key to his rediscovery of the Gospel. The fresh translation of Luther's original German and occasional Latin, together with annotations, continues to be a monument of Reformation research. Without such scholarship, Pauck thought, the idea of reformulating classical Reformation doctrine, as proposed by Karl Barth, was impossible. Hence the abiding lesson of Pauck's teaching is that critical historical scholarship and constructive theology must somehow continue to work hand in hand.

Its administrative center is the rural locality (a selo) of Karpogory. District's population: The population of Karpogory accounts for 16.5% of the district's total population. Geography The district is elongated from the northwest to the southeast; a major part of it belongs to the basin of the Pinega River which divides the district into roughly equal areas. The main tributaries of the Pinega within the district are the Yula (left), the Pokshenga (left), and the Yezhuga (right). The northern part of the district belongs to the basins of the Kuloy River and its major right tributary, the Nemnyuga. Minor areas in the east of the district drain across the border of the district to the Mezen River. The whole area of the district is in the White Sea basin. Almost the whole of the district is covered by coniferous forests (taiga). The exception are the meadows in the floodplains. There are many glacial lakes across the district, especially in its northern part. The biggest lakes are Teldozero, Poltozero, Karasozero (all in the northern part of the district), and Krasny Okun (in its southern part). Karst landscapes, with karst caves, formed in the middle course of the Pinega, now inside the district limits. These hilly landscapes contrast with the plain to the west, in the valley of the Northern Dvina River. Pinezhsky Nature Reserve, located within the district limits, had been created to protect these landscapes and designated as a protected natural area at the federal level. History The area was originally populated by the Finno-Ugric peoples and then colonized by the Novgorod Republic. After the fall of Novgorod, the area became a part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Archangelgorod Governorate, with the creation of Kevrolsky Uyezd. The seat of the uyezd was located in Kevrola, now a village. In 1780, the governorate was abolished and transformed into Vologda Viceroyalty, with the creation of Pinezhsky Uyezd in place of Kevrolsky Uyezd. The seat of the uyezd was in Pinega. In 1796, Pinezhsky Uyezd was transferred to Arkhangelsk Governorate. In 1925, the town of Pinega, while still being the administrative center of the uyezd, was downgraded in status to that of a rural locality. In February 1927, Pinezhsky Uyezd was abolished and merged into Arkhangelsky Uyezd. In 1929, several governorates were merged into Northern Krai. On July 15, 1929, the uyezds were abolished and Pinezhsky District was established. Pinezhsky District became a part of Arkhangelsk Okrug of Northern Krai. At the same time, Karpogorsky District, with the administrative center in the selo of Karpogory, was established. In 1959, Karpogorsky and Pinezhsky Districts were merged into one district with the administrative center located in Karpogory. In the following years, the first-level administrative division of Russia kept changing. In 1930, the okrug was abolished, and the district was subordinated to the central administration of Northern Krai. In 1936, the krai itself was transformed into Northern Oblast. In 1937, Northern Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast. Pinezhsky District remained in Arkhangelsk Oblast ever since. Divisions Administrative divisions Administratively, the district is divided into seventeen selsoviets. The following selsoviets have been established (the administrative centers are given in parentheses): *Chakolsky (Chakola) *Karpogorsky (Karpogory) *Kevrolsky (Kevrola) *Kushkopalsky (Kushkopala) *Lavelsky (Novolavela) *Mezhdurechensky (Mezhdurechensky) *Nyukhchensky (Zanyukhcha) *Pinezhsky (Pinega) *Pokshengsky (Kobelevo) *Shilegsky (Yasny) *Shotogorsky (Shotogorka) *Siysky (Siya) *Sosnovsky (Sosnovka) *Sursky (Sura) *Trufanogorsky (Trufanova) *Verkolsky (Verkola) *Yurolsky (Petrova) Municipal divisions Municipally, the district is divided into fifteen rural settlements (the administrative centers are given in parentheses): *Karpogorskoye Rural Settlement (Karpogory) *Kevrolskoye Rural Settlement (Kevrola) *Kushkopalskoye Rural Settlement (Kushkopala) *Lavelskoye Rural Settlement (Novolavela) *Mezhdurechenskoye Rural Settlement (Mezhdurechensky) *Nyukhchenskoye Rural Settlement (Zanyukhcha) *Pinezhskoye Rural Settlement (Pinega) *Pirinemskoye Rural Settlement (Pirinem) *Pokshengskoye Rural Settlement (Kobelevo) *Shilegskoye Rural Settlement (Yasny) *Siyskoye Rural Settlement (Siya) *Sosnovskoye Rural Settlement (Sosnovka) *Surskoye Rural Settlement (Sura) *Trufanogorskoye Rural Settlement (Trufanova) *Verkolskoye Rural Settlement (Verkola) Economy Industry Timber industry is the main industry of the district. Food industry is also present. Agriculture Agriculture accounts for 0.1% of the total production, and is mainly represented by cattle breeding and production of potatoes. Transportation A railway line connecting Arkhangelsk and Karpogory passes through the district. This line is expected to become part of the Belkomur project‚Äîa railway line connecting Arkhangelsk via the Komi Republic with Perm Krai and the Ural Mountains. The stretch between Arkhangelsk and Karpogory was built in the 1970s. The Pinega River is navigable below the village of Sogra, although there is no regular passenger navigation. In 1926‚Äî1928, a canal connecting the Pinega with the Kuloy was constructed; however, currently the canal is neglected. An important road along the right bank of the Pinega connects Arkhangelsk with the valley of the Mezen River. The road within the limits of the district is not paved. From this road another one, also unpaved, branches off and follows the Pinega to Karpogory, the village of Zanyukhcha, and then crosses the border with the Komi Republic to the timber production settlements. Culture and recreation Ruins of the Assumption Cathedral of the former Ioanno-Bogoslovsky Monastery, Sura The district contains twenty objects classified as cultural and historical heritage by Russian Federal law and additionally one object classified as cultural and historical heritage of local importance (the chapel in the village of Kushkopala). The monuments protected at the federal level include: *the buildings in the village of Verkola, including the ensemble of Artemiyev Verkolsky Monastery (the oldest building, the St. Iliya Church, is from 1697) *Chukhchenemsky Pogost in the village of Yedoma *Krasnogorsky Monastery in the village of Maletino There are two state museums in the district ‚Äî the District Museum in the settlement of Pinega and the memorial museum of the author Fyodor Abramov in the selo of Verkola, located in the building of the school where he studied. In 2004, the Karst Museum was open in the Pinezhsky Nature Reserve. The reserve attracts tourists who visit karst caves.

He had a standout college career at Saint Joseph's between 1984 and 1988 before embarking on a career that would take him to the Continental Basketball Association as well as leagues in over half a dozen countries. A , 220 lb. (100 kg) center, Blake led NCAA Division I in blocked shots during the 1986‚Äì87 season. He still remains one of the top shot blockers for a career in Division I history. Early life Blake, originally from Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, attended Monsignor Bonner High School in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania. He made a reputation for himself playing basketball and was ranked one of the top 50 players in the country by the time he graduated in 1984. He had guided Monsignor Bonner to consecutive Catholic League titles as well. Many colleges recruited him, but Blake stayed at home and chose to attend Saint Joseph's for head coach Jim Boyle. Among other reasons, he chose Saint Joseph's because of the opportunity to get significant playing minutes as a freshman. College As he expected, Blake contributed right away for the Hawks, amassing a then-school single season record 95 blocks and being named to the All-Atlantic 10 Conference Rookie Team. Known for his defense, he also possessed a soft touch around the rim and contributed on the offensive end as well. He guided the Hawks to a second round entry in the 1985 National Invitation Tournament. The following year, Blake broke his own record by recording 121 blocks. He was named to the A-10 Conference and Philadelphia Big 5 First Teams. Saint Joseph's also qualified for the 1986 NCAA Tournament and advance to the Round of 32. As his college career began to gain momentum, Blake started receiving national recognition, and by the time he was a senior he was named to the preseason John R. Wooden Award watchlist, an honor given to the players in the country who have the most realistic chances as being the national player of the year. In 1987‚Äì88, Blake led all of Division I in blocked shots per game. Publications such as Sporting News, Street & Smith's and Game Plan honored him with All-American status. The USBWA and NABC also selected him to their All-District First Teams. At the time of his graduation, Blake's 419 career blocked shots were the most in NCAA history, a mark that has been since surpassed. This total still ranks in the top 25 all-time, however. Professional and later life Despite a lauded career at Saint Joseph's, Blake went unselected in the 1988 NBA Draft. Years later, he recalled how he underestimated the importance of performing well at a pre- draft camp: \\"Senior year when I went down to [a pre-draft camp in] Orlando, I didn't realize how great an opportunity it was...I didn't understand that I had to 'bring it' because so many NBA scouts were there to evaluate us.\\" Blake got hurt in the second game of the camp and never got to showcase his talent. After individual workouts with the Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets, neither of which resulted in a regular-season contract, he began playing in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) with the Charleston Gunners. After a short while he moved to play in Italy for three months, then moved to Germany to continue playing as an expatriate. When that team went bankrupt, Blake moved back to the United States and re-joined the CBA for the Wichita Falls Texans. With the Texans, he became a key player in helping to lead the team to the first professional basketball championship in the state of Texas' history. Even though the Texans finished second to the Tulsa Fast Breakers in the Western Division during the regular season, they went on a hot streak down the stretch into the playoffs. They defeated the Quad City Thunder, four games to three in a best-of-seven series, to take the 1991 CBA Championship. Uncertain of the CBA's financial situation, Blake headed overseas once again. Over the next nine years, he had stints in Cyprus, Belgium, Finland, Switzerland, Argentina, and for the Chicago Rockers back in the CBA. In 2000, Blake decided to retire from professional basketball after 12 years. He now works as a math teacher in special education at John Bartram School in Philadelphia. He and his wife Shelly have one daughter, Elizabeth.

Davis (July 26, 1920 ‚Äì March 9, 2010) Biography He was born in Columbus, Mississippi on July 26, 1920.

Career and education Troy Jollimore was born in 1971 in Liverpool, Nova Scotia and attended the University of King's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He earned his Ph.D. in Philosophy from Princeton University in 1999, under the direction of Harry Frankfurt and Gilbert Harman. He has lived in the U.S. since 1993 and is currently Professor of Philosophy at California State University, Chico.http://www.csuchico.edu/~tjollimore/ He has been an External Faculty Fellow at the Stanford Humanities Center (2006‚Äì07), the Stanley P. Young Fellow in Poetry at the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference (2012), and a Guggenheim Fellow (2013). Jollimore's philosophical writings frequently concern ethical issues connected to personal relationships. His first book, Friendship and Agent-Relative Morality, was published in 2001; his second, Love's Vision, appeared in 2011, and his third, On Loyalty, in 2012. He has also published on topics including the ethics of terrorism, the depiction of evil in literature, the nature of happiness, and so-called \\"admirable immorality.\\" His first collection of poetry, Tom Thomson in Purgatory, won the National Book Critics Circle award for poetry in 2006. In an interview with the Los Angeles Review Of Books, Jollimore insisted that books should include reoccurring concepts and consistent details that connect the story. He believed the rough sketch of the book shouldn't be self-serving with the business of selling the book and rather, this collective theory of grabbing ideas makes an excellent book for the reader. It was also nominated for the 2007 Poets' Prize, and individual poems in the collection received nominations for the Pushcart Prize. His second collection, At Lake Scugog, appeared in the Princeton Series of Contemporary Poets in 2011. In the same interview from the Los Angeles Review of Books, Jollimore believed Tom Thomson in Purgatory had to be realistic in his actual narrative and that the new poems of At Lake Scugog serve as a continuation. Jollimore argues that poetry should be free and allow the poet to tinker some more on the poem. His third, Syllabus of Errors, was published in the same series and was selected by the New York Times as one of the \\"Best Poetry Books of 2015.\\" In an interview from Princeton University Press, Jollimore explained the name of the book comes from a suggestive list of blasphemies within the real Syllabus of Errors and how all of these were meant for the followers of Catholicism to stay away from. However, Jollimore included many intentional mistakes in the opening lines of the poem as a way to further investigate why they exist and the incredible abilities linked to them. Jollimore furthered explained that poems shouldn't be accurate with form every single time and rather, unpacking the myths of English language. Jollimore's poems have appeared in publications including The New Yorker, The Believer, McSweeney's, and Poetry. He is also a frequent book reviewer, writing for the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Boston Globe, and the Boston Review, among others. Views Some of his academic work relates to ethics in regards to normality, ethical nihilism, ethics connecting to personal relations (especially with companionship and romantic relations), the ethics between extreme terrorist acts and with the war on terror, and the natural world within reasoning and the theory of aesthetics. Jollimore's philosophical writings frequently concern ethical issues connected to personal relationships. His first book, Friendship and Agent-Relative Morality, was published in 2001. His second book, Love's Vision, appeared in 2011. Within the Philosophy in Review article from 2012 , Jollimore argued that you cannot discover love if you see a person for all the things they hold onto because then it's no mystery in regards to true purpose. His book Love's Vision can be identified as a way to look at the restrictions on loving someone and how modernized it is seen within romantic relationships. Jollimore's third book, On Loyalty, came out in 2012. He has also published on topics including the ethics of terrorism, the depiction of evil in literature, the nature of happiness, and so-called \\"admirable immorality.\\" Jollimore has discussed questionable issues on personal relationships in relation to Artificial intelligence in his Midwest Studies in Philosophy article 'This Endless Space between the Words.' He argues the real debate on artificial intelligence to act in the same way as a person in the movie Her. Jollimore completely probes the dynamics of giving a demonstration on how the robot would demonstrate love to a person and try to authenticate love like a human being. However, Jollimore reveals the only way to validate this type of behavior is by completing the Turing Test. Jollimore analyzes the Turing test as a probability to giving human life with the robot. In fact, Jollimore furthered his theory when he examined the authenticated view of a person's emotion by looking at video games.

It is often available as its sodium salt, poly(methacrylic acid) sodium salt. The monomer is a viscous liquid with a pungent odour. The first polymeric form of methacrylic acid was described in 1880 by Engelhorn and Fittig. The use of high purity monomers is required for proper polymerization conditions and therefore it is necessary to remove any inhibitors by extraction (phenolic inhibitors) or via distillation. To prevent inhibition by dissolved oxygen, monomers should be carefully degassed prior to the start of the polymerization. Polymerization PMAA has a pKa of ~4.8, meaning that at neutral pH the MAA groups in the network are almost entirely deprotonated making it an anionic polymer. PMAA can acts as a polyelectrolyte and has the ability to absorb and retain water. These properties are strongly affected by the pH and therefore many hydrogels are composed of PMAA copolymers. These hydrogel capsules can act as carrier vessels for confined drugs and act as microreactor reservoirs. For certain applications the sodium salt form of PMAA is used, in order to minimize side effects occurring from the anionic charge of the polymer or in applications where solubility in different solvents is required. The conventional synthesis method of PMAA is free radical polymerization. In aqueous solution, substantial differences have been described in the polymerization rate of non-ionized and fully ionized MAA (pH effect). For the non-ionized scenario, a kinetic model has been well described. Recent progress has been made for (partially) ionized MAA by introducing a new rate law for propagation where electrostatic and non- electrostatic effects are explicitly considered. In addition, the rate constant of propagation (kp) during free radical polymerization of methacrylic acid is prone to the monomer concentration. With pulsed layer polymerization size-exclusion chromatography techniques, it was determined that there is a minor decrease for partially ionized MAA while when MAA is fully ionized, kp increases with higher concentration. The latter is in accordance with transition state theory for propagation. Controlled polymerization techniques, such as RAFT and NMP can be used for the direct polymerization of MAA. In contrast, polymerization of acidic monomers, such as MAA, has traditionally posed a challenge with, for example, anionic polymerization, group transfer polymerization (GTP, see living polymerization) and ATRP. The latter is not currently well understood but reasons hypothesized include ligand protonation at low pH, competitive coordination of carboxylate moieties to the copper and displacement of halide anions from the Cu(II) deactivator complex. Protecting group chemistry is commonly used for the polymerization of acidic monomers (using alkyl esters), followed by deprotection and purification, but other methods have also been explored. PMAA cyclization proved to be the main cause of termination, and this was reduced by changing the leaving group and the nucleophile, lowering the pH to reduce concentration and carboxylate anions, and accelerating the rate of polymerization. This work overcame one of the main limitations in ATRP and showed that water can be used as solvent for the polymerization of polar monomers using ATRP.

He later became the third ranking officer in the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War.Paullin, 1906, p. 506Fredriksen, 2006Allen, 1922, pp. 4‚Äì5 Early life McNeill was born in County Antrim, Ireland on October 10, 1728 to Malcolm and Mary (n√©e Stuart) McNeill, who were Scottish migrants to Ulster. At the age of nine, he emigrated with his parents to Boston in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, arriving there on September 7, 1737. He received his education in the Boston Public Schools. On November 12, 1750, he married to Mary Wilson in the First Presbyterian Church. Their first son was named Robert, born April 12, 1752 who died in September the following year. In November their next son, Hector Jr. was born. Two other daughter were born soon after. Seven Years War McNeil entered the King's service as a merchant marine in April 1755 and was given command of a ship that took General Monckton to Nova Scotia where he remained during the siege of Beausejour. He returned to Boston in October that same year. At year's end, just before the beginning of the Seven Years' War he was commanding a vessel that was captured by Indians allied with the French in Passamaquoddy Bay and taken north to Quebec as a prisoner. After a prisoner exchange he was able to acquire another ship and worked in the New England coastal trade. Post war After the war, he continued sailing a number of merchant ships between Quebec and Boston, including the sloop Phenix with a large number of passengers in April 1765 and the sloop Fanny and Jeany in November 1766. He also commanded the sloop Brittania and Swallow in 1767 and 1768 respectively. McNeill's first wife, Mary Wilson, died on February 7, 1769 and is buried in the Granary Burying Ground. He remarried on December 26, 1770 to Mary Watt with whom he shared a daughter, Sarah. Beginning of American Revolution Before the beginning of the American Revolution, McNeill was living in British-held Quebec. When war began Governor-General Guy Carleton demanded he either join the militia for the British or leave the colony. McNeill left and was soon transporting supplies to the American army's invasion of Canada under General Benedict Arnold. McNeill continued in this role for several months until British reinforcements caused the Americans to retreat from Canada. Naval Service In June 1776, McNeill went before the Continental Congress to lobby for a commission as a Captain in the Continental Navy. He was granted the position on June 15 and installed as its third-ranking captain. He was given command of the new frigate which was outfitted at Newburyport, Massachusetts. After a year preparing the ship to be battle-worthy and finding a crew, the Boston joined another new frigate the to form a squadron under the command of the Navy's second ranking officer Captain John Manley. Personality conflicts often arose between McNeill and Manley, in part due to the scarcity of supplies and available crew. Combat On May 21, 1777 the squadron fought in the Grand Banks. On June 8, 1777 they captured . During the 90 minute battle, Manley's ship had done most of the fighting but McNeill was able to position his ship in order to take possession of the British frigate. Manley ordered McNeill to relinquish possession of Fox to his crew, causing further animosity between them. On July 7, 1777 Manley sailed ahead of the rest of the squadron and encountered Captain George Collier's and HMS Flora. Due to disciplined training, the British easily bested the American squadron. Manly would have been able to escape the slower ships, but due to heavy cargo in the forward holds of the Hancock the bow dipped, slowing the craft. After a 39-hour chase, the British captured Hancock and Fox on July 9. McNeill did not support Manley during his flight, instead withdrawing to the safety of the Sheepscot River, Maine. Court-Martial and privateering McNeill remained in Maine for a month, while criticism of his leadership continued to grow. After a prisoner exchange released Manley, both men were court-martialed with the result for McNeill being dismissal from the Navy without ceremony. For the rest of the war he acted as a privateer for Massachusetts, commanding the Pallas and Adventure. Final years After the war, McNeill returned to the merchant marine and was lost at sea on December 25, 1785. Note Captain Hector McNeill should not be confused with British Loyalist Colonel Hector McNeill who with Col. David Fanning co-led a surprise attack on American forces under Governor Thomas Burke at Hillsboro, North Carolina on September 12, 1781. An American counter-attack under General John Butler inflicted losses on the Loyalists including the death of McNeill and causing them to abandon Burke and their other prisoners.

He received the Medal of Honor for gallantry during the Siege of Vicksburg on May 22, 1863. Union assault On May 22, 1863, General Ulysses S. Grant ordered an assault on the Confederate heights at Vicksburg, Mississippi. The plan called for a storming party of volunteers to build a bridge across a moat and plant scaling ladders against the enemy embankment in advance of the main attack. The volunteers knew the odds were against survival and the mission was called, in nineteenth century vernacular, a \\"forlorn hope\\". Only single men were accepted as volunteers and even then, twice as many men as needed came forward and were turned away. The assault began in the early morning following a naval bombardment.

It is located in a very remote area, near Black Canyon City, Arizona, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 for its architecture. It was designed by the USDA Forest Service in Bungalow/Craftsman style. It served historically as a camp and as a government office. The NRHP listing included two contributing buildings on . In the 1920s and 1930s, Forest Service employees often traveled many miles from local ranger stations to forest work sites. Since the forest road networks were not well developed, getting to a job site meant a long trek, carrying all the equipment needed to perform the field work. This made it impractical for employees to make daily round trips. To facilitate work at remote sites, the Forest Service built guard stations at strategic locations throughout the forest to house fire patrols and project crews. After World War II, the Forest Service greatly expanded its road network, allowing employees to get to most National Forest areas within a few hours. As a result, guard stations lost their utility. The Forest Service found new uses for some stations, but most were demolished or abandoned. In the 1990s, historic preservation groups, with the support of Forest Service employees, began pressing National Forest managers to preserve the remaining structures. To finance the preservation effort, the Forest Service started renting its guard stations to the public. It later began renting out many unused fire lookout towers as well.Outbuilding, in draw below, in 2008 Aermotor wind pump, in draw below Perspective Its Bungalow style was of the architecture adopted most widely by the USFS architects of the region.

In the 1960s, dopamine neurons were first identified and named by Annica Dahlstr√∂m and Kjell Fuxe, who used histochemical fluorescence. The subsequent discovery of genes encoding enzymes that synthesize dopamine, and transporters that incorporate dopamine into synaptic vesicles or reclaim it after synaptic release, enabled scientists to identify dopaminergic neurons by labeling gene or protein expression that is specific to these neurons. In the mammalian brain, dopaminergic neurons form a semi-continuous population extending from the midbrain through the forebrain, with eleven named clusters among them.  Cell group A8  Group A8 is a small group of dopaminergic cells in rodents and primates. It is located in the midbrain reticular formation dorsolateral to the substantia nigra at the level of the red nucleus and caudally. In the mouse it is identified with the retrorubral field as defined by classical stains.  Cell group A9  Group A9 is the most densely packed group of dopaminergic cells, and is located in the ventrolateral midbrain of rodents and primates. It is for the most part identical with the pars compacta of the substantia nigra as seen from the accumulation of neuromelanin pigment in the midbrain of healthy, adult humans.  Cell group A10  Group A10 is the largest group of dopaminergic cells in the ventral midbrain tegmentum of rodents and primates. The cells are located for the most part in the ventral tegmental area, the linear nucleus and, in primates, the part of central gray of the midbrain located between the left and right oculomotor nuclear complexes.  Cell group A11  Group A11 is a small group of dopaminergic cells located in the posterior periventricular nucleus and the intermediate periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus in the macaque. In the rat, small numbers of cells assigned to this group are also found in the posterior nucleus of hypothalamus, the supramammillary area and the reuniens nucleus. Dopaminergic cells in A11 may be important in the modulation of auditory processing.  Cell group A12  Group A12 is a small group of cells in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus in primates. In the rat a few cells belonging to this group are also seen in the anteroventral portion of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.  Cell group A13  Group A13 is distributed in clusters that, in the primate, are ventral and medial to the mammillothalamic tract of the hypothalamus; a few extend into the reuniens nucleus of the thalamus. In the mouse, A13 is located ventral to the mammillothalamic tract of the thalamus in the zona incerta.  Cell group A14  Group A14 consists of a few cells observed in and near the preoptic periventricular nucleus of the primate. In the mouse, cells in the anterodorsal preoptic nucleus are assigned to this group.  Cell group A15  Group A15 exists in a few species, such as sheep, and immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase, a precursor of dopamine, in many other species including rodents and primates. It is located in ventral and dorsal components within the preoptic periventricular nucleus and adjacent parts of the anterior hypothalamic region. It is continuous caudally with the dopaminergic group A14.  Cell group A16  Group A16 is located in the olfactory bulb of vertebrates, including rodents and primates.  Cell group Aaq  Group Aaq is a sparse group of cells located in the rostral half of the central gray of the midbrain in primates. It is more prominent in the squirrel monkey (Saimiri) than the macaque.  Telencephalic group  This group is a population of cells immunoreactive for dopamine and tyrosine hydroxylase that are broadly distributed in the rostral forebrain, including such structures as: substantia innominata, diagonal band, olfactory tubercle, prepyriform area, striatum (at levels rostral to the anterior commissure), claustrum, and deep cortical layers of all gyri of the frontal lobe rostral to the head of the caudate nucleus; the cells are also numerous in intervening white matter, including the external capsule, extreme capsule and frontal white matter. They are found in the rodent, the macaque and the human.

He began dancing when he was young at the Civic Light Opera Academy and the Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He received BFA from SUNY Purchase and an MFA from the NYU Tisch School of the Arts. Prior to starting his company A.I.M (Abraham.In.Motion), he performed with a number of companies, including David Dorfman Dance, Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company, The Kevin Wynn Collective, Nathan Trice/Rituals, Dance Alloy and Attack Theatre. Critical acclaim In 2009, Abraham was listed in Dance Magazine‚Ä≤s \\"25 to Watch\\" where he was described as, \\"equal parts power and grace.\\" In 2010, he was awarded a Bessie Award for his piece The Radio Show. Critic Wendy Perron has described him as \\"sensual, thoughtful, wild, stuttering\\", commenting that he was \\"burning a hole through that tiny space\\" with regard to his \\"Heartbreaks and Homies\\" evening of dance at Joe's Pub. Abraham's work The Runaway for the New York City Ballet‚Äôs 2018 Fall Fashion Gala was recognized as a ‚ÄúBest Dance of 2018‚Äù by The New York Times. Works and career milestones Abraham established his company A.I.M (formerly Abraham.In.Motion) in 2006 with its first major work, Fading into Something Tangible, premiering in Pittsburgh. Abraham creates work for his company that draws from his personal experiences; often exploring themes of adversity, emotion and the relationship between music and dance. In Abraham's The Radio Show, he \\"delves into identity and personal history....Creating an abstract narrative around the loss of communication, he investigates the effects of the abrupt discontinuation of a radio station on a community and the lingering effects of Alzheimer's and aphasia on a family. Abraham mixes recordings of classic soul and hip-hop with contemporary classical compositions to create an eclectic score that evokes fond memories and a passion for what is lost.\\" Abraham's other works include A Ramp to Paradise, Op. 1, Live! The Realest MC, and Pavement. A Ramp to Paradise, choreographed by Kyle Abraham and commissioned by THPAC, is about a true story by Alex Smith that describes the history of the black gay underground club called Paradise Garage. This club was the \\"it\\" place in the New York City 1970s and '80s dance world. Op. 1 is a performance inspired by photographer Eadweard Muybridge's art. Live! The Realest MC (commissioned by The Kitchen and choreographed by Kyle Abraham) is a reenactment of Walt Disney's Pinocchio in an urban environment. In consists of a journey to find \\"realness\\" and includes hip hop karaoke. Pavement, premiered at Harlem Stage in November 2012, is inspired by the 1991 film Boyz n the Hood. It includes a wide variety of music, ranging from Bach to Sam Cooke, to express the themes of violence, love, and pain in Pavement. Seen from the perspective of a group of friends struggling to stay together while their community is tearing apart, critics were struck by this piece, Andrew Boynton of The New Yorker saying: \\"Pavement is a hard, unforgiving thing, but for some people it's also home.\\" Abraham was the 2012-14 Resident Commissioned Artist at New York Live Arts, and created two new works for the Live Arts stage. The Watershed premiered at New York Live Arts on September 23, 2014 with scenic design by visual artist Glenn Ligon and a score ranging from a contemporary cello suite to Otis Redding.

Another Night, commissioned for Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, premiered at New York's City Center in December 2012. Of this piece, Rebecca Bengal of Vogue writes: \\"What Abraham brings to Ailey is an avant-garde aesthetic, an original and politically minded downtown sensibility that doesn't distinguish between genres but freely draws on a vocabulary that is as much Merce and Martha as it is Eadweard Muybridge and Michael Jackson.\\" Untitled America, also commissioned for Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, is a 3-part work which premiered in 2016. The Runaway, for New York City Ballet, premiered at the 2018 Fall Fashion Gala, and was recognized as \\"Best Dance of 2018\\" by the New York Times.

Resolution Observations The Security Council viewed terrorism as one of the greatest threats to international peace and security. It condemned and expressed concern at the increasing number of attacks by Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, the Taliban and other individuals and groups. Council members reaffirmed that terrorism could be defeated only through a comprehensive approach with the active participation and co-operation of all countries and international organisations; in this context, dialogue between the 1267 Committee and states was important, and co-operation with Interpol was welcomed. Meanwhile, the preamble of the resolution also expressed concern at misuse of the Internet by terrorist groups and individuals, further noting the changing nature of the threat, particularly in the way terrorists would promote their ideologies. Acts The following measures were enacted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, thus making the measures legal under international law. All countries were required to impose an arms embargo, travel ban and financial sanctions against all terrorist groups and individuals. Furthermore, countries could propose names for listing on a sanctions list and had to use the form provided in the annex of the resolution. The 1267 Committee was asked to develop, adopt and implement guidelines regarding individuals to be removed from the list. The resolution went on to detail procedures for implementing the measures, taking note of exemptions, co-operation and the exchange of information, sanctions on the Taliban and outreach. The mandate of the monitoring team based in New York City was extended for a further period of 18 months; its responsibilities were outlined in the annex of the resolution, including dealing with instances of non-compliance.

Since they are for the most part localized to classical brainstem nuclei, particularly the raphe nuclei, they are more often referred to by the names of those nuclei than by the B1-9 nomenclature. These cells appear to be common across most mammals and have two main regions in which they develop; one forms in the mesencephlon and the rostral pons (find articles/links) and the other in the medulla oblongata and the caudal pons.R. Nieuwenhuys, J. Voogd, C. Van Huijzen, The human central nervous system: a synopsis and atlas (Springer Science & Business Media, 2007). Nine serotonergic cell groups have been identified.  B1 cell group  Cell group B1 occupies the midline nucleus raphes pallidus and adjacent structures in the caudal medulla oblongata of the rodent and the primate.  B2 cell group  Cell group B2 occupies the midline nucleus raphes obscurus and adjacent structures in the caudal medulla oblongata of the rodent and the primate.  B3 cell group  Cell group B3 occupies the midline nucleus raphes magnus and adjacent structures in the caudal medulla oblongata of the rodent and the primate. Its boundary with the serotonergic group B1 is indistinct.  B4 cell group  Cell group B4 is located in the floor of the fourth ventricle, in the vicinity of the vestibular nuclei and abducens nucleus in the rat and in the caudal interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus of the mouse. A comprehensive study of monoaminergic cell groups in the macaque and the squirrel monkey did not identify a B4 cell group distinct from other groups in the region.  B5 cell group  Cell group B5 is located in the midline pontine raphe nucleus and adjacent areas in the rodent and the primate.  B6 cell group  Cell group B6 is located in the floor of the fourth ventricle dorsal to, and between, the right and left medial longitudinal fasciculus of the pons in the primate and the rodent. and forms the caudal portion of the dorsal raphe nucleus.  B7 cell group  Cell group B7 is a group of cells located in the central gray of the pons, the dorsal raphe nucleus and adjacent structures in the primate and the rodent.  B8 cell group  Cell group B8 is located in the dorsal part of the median raphe nucleus (superior central nucleus) and adjacent structures of the pontine reticular formation of the rodent and the primate.  B9 cell group  Cell group B9 is a group of cells located in the pontine tegmentum, ventral to serotonergic group B8. In the nonhuman primate they are found in the ventral part of the superior central nucleus and adjacent structures.

On 22 July 2011, he killed eight people by detonating a van bomb amid Regjeringskvartalet in Oslo, then shot dead 69 participants of a Workers' Youth League (AUF) summer camp on the island of Ut√∏ya. In July 2012, he was convicted of mass murder, causing a fatal explosion, and terrorism.The verdict convicts Breivik for violations of the criminal code ¬ß147 (terrorism), ¬ß148 (fatal explosion), and ¬ß233 (murder). While still a juvenile, he was arrested, and was consequently rejected from the Norwegian Armed Forces. At the age of 20 he joined the anti- immigration/right-wing Progress Party, and chaired the local Vest Oslo branch of the party's youth organization during 2002. He left the Progress Party in 2006 and went on to join a gun club, while also founding a company which he used to finance his planned terrorist attacks. On the day of the attacks, Breivik electronically distributed a compendium of texts entitled 2083: A European Declaration of Independence, describing his militant ideology. In them, he stated his opposition to Islam and blamed feminism for a European \\"cultural suicide.\\"Jones, Jane Clare. Anders Breivik's chilling anti-feminism, The Guardian, 27 July 2011.Goldberg, Michelle. Norway Killer's Hatred of Women, The Daily Beast, 24 July 2011. The text called for the deportation of all Muslims from Europe and Breivik wrote that his main motive for the attacks was to publicize his manifesto. Two teams of court-appointed forensic psychiatrists examined Breivik before his trial. The first team diagnosed Breivik with paranoid schizophrenia but after this initial finding was criticized, a second evaluation concluded that he was not psychotic during the attacks but did have narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder. His trial began on 16 April 2012, with closing arguments made on 22 June 2012. On 24 August 2012, Oslo District Court delivered its verdict, finding Breivik sane and guilty of murdering 77 people. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison, in a form of preventive detention that required a minimum of 10 years incarceration and the possibility of one or more extensions for as long as he is deemed a danger to society. This is the maximum penalty in Norway. Breivik announced that he did not recognize the legitimacy of the court and therefore did not accept its decision‚Äîhe decided not to appeal because this would legitimize the authority of the Oslo District Court. In 2016, Breivik sued the Norwegian Correctional Service, claiming that his solitary confinement violated his human rights. A subsequent court ruling found that his rights had not been violated, despite an earlier ruling, and in June 2017, Breivik filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), which dismissed his case in June 2018. As of September 2020, his lawyer (√òystein Storrvik) has made an application for parole, on behalf of Breivik; Breivik has the right to have the courts make a decision regarding [his application] for parole; in the case of Breivik - he has to serve at least ten years before [possibly] being paroled. https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/weEvVP/breivik-begjaerer-seg-loeslatt- fra-fengsel \\"Det opplyser massemorderens forsvarer, advokat √òystein Storrvik til VG. ‚Äì Jeg har p√• vegne av ham sendt inn en begj√¶ring om pr√∏vel√∏slatelse, sier Storrvik til VG. ‚Äì Han har krav p√• domstolspr√∏ving av pr√∏vel√∏slatelse ved minstetid som er ti √•r i hans tilfelle. \\" Since his imprisonment, Breivik has identified himself as a fascist and a Nazi, who practices Odinism and uses counterjihadist rhetoric to support ethno-nationalists. After he had carried out his attacks, it became known that psychiatrists had recommended him be removed from his mother and placed into foster care when he was 4 years old, as she was heavily emotionally and psychologically abusive towards him. However, the recommendation made by the psychiatrists was not followed, and Breivik remained in her care. Names and early life His family name is Breivik, while Behring, his mother's maiden name, is his middle name and not part of the family name. His family name comes from Breivika in Hadsel, and literally means \\"broad vik\\" or \\"broad bay.\\" On 9 June 2017, Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang reported Breivik had changed his legal name to Fjotolf Hansen. West End of Oslo. From 1982 to 1994, he lived with his mother in this apartment building in Sk√∏yen. Breivik was born in Oslo on 13 February 1979, the son of Wenche Behring (1946‚Äì2013), a nurse, and Jens David Breivik (born 1935), a civil economist, who worked as a diplomat for the Norwegian Embassy in London and later in Paris. He spent the first year of his life in London until his parents divorced when he was a year old. His father, who later married a diplomat, fought for, but failed to achieve, custody. When Breivik was four, living in Fritzners gate in Oslo, two reports were filed expressing concern about his mental health, concluding that Anders ought to be removed from parental care. A psychologist in one of the reports made a note of the boy's peculiar smile, suggesting it was not anchored in his emotions but was rather a deliberate response to his environment. In another report by psychologists from Norway's centre for child and youth psychiatry (SSBU) concerns were raised about how his mother treated him: \\"She 'sexualised' the young Breivik, hit him, and frequently told him that she wished that he were dead.\\" In the report Wenche Behring is described as \\"a woman with an extremely difficult upbringing, borderline personality disorder and an all-encompassing if only partially visible depression\\" who \\"projects her primitive aggressive and sexual fantasies onto him [Breivik]\\". The psychologist who wrote the report was later forbidden to give evidence in court by Behring, who herself was excused from testifying on health grounds. Breivik attended Smestad Grammar School, Ris Junior High, Hartvig Nissens Upper Secondary School and Oslo Commerce School (1995‚Äì98). A former classmate has recalled that he was an intelligent student, physically stronger than others of the same age, who often took care of people who were bullied. Breivik lived with his mother and his half sister in the West End of Oslo and regularly visited his father and stepmother in France, until they divorced when he was 12. His mother also remarried, to an officer in the Norwegian Army. Breivik chose to be confirmed into the Lutheran Church of Norway at the age of 15. In his adolescence, Breivik's behaviour was described as having become rebellious. In his early teen years he was a prolific graffiti artist, part of the hip hop community in Oslo West. He took his graffiti much more seriously than his comrades did and was caught by the police on several occasions; child welfare services were notified once and he was fined on two occasions. According to Breivik's mother, after he was caught spraying graffiti on walls in 1995, at the age of 16, and fined, his father stopped contact with him. They have not been in contact since then. The opposite view is claimed by Breivik's father, that it was his son who broke off contact with him and that he would have always welcomed Anders despite his destructive activities. At this age he also broke off contact with the hip hop community after he fell out with his best friend. Since adolescence, Breivik had spent much time on weight training, and started using anabolic steroids. He cared a lot about his own looks and about appearing big and strong. Breivik has criticised his parents for supporting the policies of the Norwegian Labour Party and his mother for being, in his opinion, a moderate feminist. Failure of social services to remove Breivik from his abusive mother In 1983 and 1984 some of Norway's top psychologists wanted to have Breivik forcibly removed from his mother, Wenche Behring. These psychologists worked at National Centre for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Statens Senter for Barne- og Ungdomspsykiatri (the SSBU). They had placed a care order for the boy but this was not carried out by Barnevernet, Norway's state Child Welfare Service. After the attacks on 22 July 2011 one of the psychologists who had observed Breivik as a child stated that \\"If Anders had been removed from his abusive home he would have developed altogether differently. His actions are essentially an extreme expression of the price society has to pay for the inadequacy of the Child Welfare Services.\\" During that time the three-generation hypothesis was applied to explain why some children develop severe mental issues. This hypothesis states that if the parents had a difficult childhood and a bad relationship with the grandparents and because of that failure to develop a healthy bond with their children, the third generation develops severe issues. Breivik's mother had had to take care of her disabled mother starting from age eight. The grandmother had contracted polio and became paralysed and wheelchair-bound. Wenche also lost her father as he died when she was eight years old. The people surrounding the family and social services failed to provide help to the family so that Wenche was constantly overstrained with having to watch her disabled mother while still being a child herself. On top of her handicap, the grandmother developed psychosis and constantly blamed her daughter for her illness. She made Wenche completely sacrifice her life for her so that she wasn't allowed to develop as a normal child at all and didn't attend school regularly or build a stable group of friends. She fled her abusive home at age 17 and soon after that became a teenage mother. Some time later she met Jens Breivik, who later became Anders' father. During her pregnancy Breivik‚Äôs mother already developed a disdain for him. She claimed that he was a \\"nasty child\\" and that he was \\"kicking her on purpose\\". She had wanted to abort him but at the time that she returned to Norway from the UK, she had already passed the three months threshold for an abortion. Psychologists reports stated that she thought that Breivik was a \\"fundamentally nasty and evil child and determined to destroy her.\\" She stopped breastfeeding her son pretty early on because he was \\"sucking the life out of her.\\" Breivik's mother moved back to Oslo in no. 18, Fritznersgate, where Jens Breivik had an apartment. The neighbors claimed that there were noises of fights and that the mother left her children completely alone for extended periods of time, while she was working as a nurse. In 1981 Breivik's mother applied for economic help and in 1982 she applied for respite care for her son. She says that she was overwhelmed with the boy and unable to care for him. She described him to be \\"clingy and demanding.\\" Breivik was then placed with a young couple. This couple later told police that the mother, when bringing two-year-old Breivik to the house, had asked that he be allowed to touch the man's penis because he had no one to compare himself to in terms of appearance. 'All he ever saw were girls' parts. This suggests that Breivik had been sexually abused by the age of two already. In February 1983, on the advice of her neighbors, Breivik's mother sought help from the National Centre for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (SSBU) in Oslo. There the mother then stayed during the day with Breivik and was observed by psychiatrists for about one month. The conclusion of the stay from the psychiatrists was that Breivik should be placed in the foster care system and had to be removed from his mother for him to develop normally. The justification for this was several observations. Breivik was almost completely void of any emotional engagement. He didn't show joy. He didn't cry when he was hurt. He made no attempts to play with other children. He was also extremely clean and became anxious when his toys weren't in order. Psychologists believed that he had become this way because of the negative reactions his mother displayed to any emotion he showed. They thought that she had punished him and reacted extremely negatively to him displaying emotions that had led him to become devoid of any visible emotions. His mother had also claimed that he was unclean and that she constantly had to care for him and run after him. Psychologists believed that Breivik had become this clean because of fear of punishment from his mother. He didn't show the normal level of uncleanliness of a four-year-old. Breivik seemed extremely careful and controlled. He had no repertoire on how to express emotions normally. During long phases of emotional voidness he would rarely erupt and display extreme uncontrolled emotions. Reports of the staff said that his mother had told Breivik while she knew that she was being observed by health personnel that she \\"wished that he was dead\\". At the same time, she tied him to her and switched from being very affectionate to being extremely cruel from one minute to the other. This was an unacceptable situation for a four-year-old to be in, according to the psychiatrists. The report from 1983 stated \\"Anders is a victim of his mother's projections of paranoid-aggressive and sexual fears toward men in general\\", and \\"she projects onto him her own primitive, aggressive and sexual fantasies; all the qualities in men that she regards as dangerous and aggressive.\\" Breivik reacted very negatively to his mother. He alternated between clinginess, petty aggression and extreme childishness. The final conclusion of the observation was that \\"The family is in dire need of help. Anders should be removed from the family and given a better standard of care; the mother is provoked by him and remains in an ambivalent position which prevents him from developing on his own terms. Anders has become an anxious, passive child that averts making contact. He displays a manic defense mechanism of restless activity and a feigned, deflecting smile. Considering the profoundly pathological relationship between Anders and his mother it is crucial to make an early effort to ward off a severely skewed development in the boy.\\" However, Child Welfare Services did not follow this recommendation. They did not understand how harmful the treatment of his mother was for Breivik. Instead, he was placed in respite care only during the weekends. SSBU hoped that eventually he would be fully placed into foster care. However when Breivik's father, Jens Breivik, learned of the situation he filed for custody. Although Breivik's mother had agreed to have him put in respite care, after Jens had filed for custody she demanded that Breivik be put back into full custody with her. Both the mother and father got lawyers involved. Eventually, the case was dropped because the Welfare Services thought that they wouldn't be able to provide enough evidence in court to warrant the placement of Breivik in foster care. One of the main reasons for this was the testimony of staff from the Vigelandsparken nursery, which Breivik had been attending since 1981. They described him as a happy child and claimed that nothing was wrong or had been wrong with him all along. During all of this the SSBU maintained their stances and said \\"urgent action is crucially needed to prevent a severely skewed development in the boy\\". The SSBU wrote Child Welfare Services a letter claiming that an order should be placed to have Breivik be removed by force. In 1984 a hearing in front of Barnevernsnemnda (the municipal child welfare committee) took place on whether Breivik's mother should lose custody of him. During the hearing, a young social worker who had never represented a case in court before was up against the experienced lawyer hired by Breivik's mother. She naturally won the case. It was ruled that the family should be supervised. However after only three visits the supervision was discontinued. Breivik was never again put into respite care or foster care. SSBU heavily criticised the decision stating \\"The family's situation was deeply troubling. The boy was at risk of developing serious issues, and had the Child Welfare Service deliberately chosen to do nothing, they would have failed him. If however, they rejected to act on the SSBU's suggestions, the SSBU cannot be faulted. They did not have authority to make formal decisions. Only the Child Welfare Service could do that.\\" Adulthood Breivik was exempt from conscription to military service in the Norwegian Army and had no military training. The Norwegian Defence Security Department, which conducts the vetting process, say he was deemed \\"unfit for service\\" at the mandatory conscript assessment. After the age of 21, Breivik was in the customer service department of an unnamed company, working with \\"people from all countries\\" and being \\"kind to everyone\\".dead link A former co-worker described him as an \\"exceptional colleague\\", while a close friend of his said he usually had a big ego and would be easily irritated by those of Arab or South Asian origin. According to Belarusian opposition figure Mikhail Reshetnikov, Anders Breivik underwent paramilitary training in a camp organised by retired KGB colonel Valery Lunev. According to Reshetnikov, Breivik visited Belarus three times and had lasting connections with the country. According to official data, Breivik visited Belarus only once, as a tourist in 2005. Norwegian prosecuting authorities claim that Breivik went to Belarus to meet a woman he had met on a dating website. This woman later visited him in Oslo. According to friends, Breivik had cosmetic surgery on his chin, nose and forehead while in his early twenties, and was pleased with the result. 2011 terror attacks Planning Breivik claims that in 2002 (at the age of 23) he started a nine-year-plan to finance the 2011 attacks, founding his own computer programming business while working at the customer service company. He claims that his company grew to six employees and \\"several offshore bank accounts\\", and that he made his first million kroner at the age of 24. He writes in his manifesto that he lost 2 million kroner on stock speculation, but still had about 2 million kroner to finance the attack. The company was later declared bankrupt and Breivik was reported for several breaches of the law. He then moved back to his mother's home to, according to him, save money. The first set of psychiatrists who evaluated him said in their report his mental health deteriorated at this stage and he went into a state of withdrawal and isolation. His declared assets in 2007 were about . (using a July 2011 conversion rate), according to Norwegian tax authority figures. He claims that by 2008 he had about () and nine credit cards giving him access to ‚Ç¨26,000 in credit. In May 2009, he founded a farming company under the name \\"Breivik Geofarm\\", described as a farming sole proprietorship set up to cultivate vegetables, melons, roots, and tubers. In 2010, he visited Prague in an attempt to buy illegal weapons. He was unable to obtain a weapon there and decided to get weapons through legal channels in Norway instead. He bought one semi-automatic 9 mm Glock 34 pistol legally by demonstrating his membership in a pistol club in the police application for a gun license, and the semi-automatic Ruger Mini-14 rifle by possessing a hunting license. Breivik's manifesto included writings detailing how he played video games such as World of Warcraft to relax, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 for \\"training-simulation\\". He told a court in April 2012 that he trained for shooting using a holographic device while playing Call of Duty. He claimed it helped him gain target acquisition. Breivik had no declared income in 2009 and his assets amounted to 390,000 kroner ($72,063), according to Norwegian tax authority figures. He states that in January 2010 his funds were \\"depleting gradually\\". On 23 June 2011, a month before the attacks, he paid the outstanding amount on his nine credit cards so he could have access to funds during his preparations. In late June or early July 2011, he moved to a rural area south of √Östa in √Ömot, Hedmark county, about north-east of Oslo, the site of his farm. As he admits in his manifesto he used the company as a cover to legally obtain large amounts of artificial fertiliser and other chemicals for the manufacturing of explosives. A farming supplier sold Breivik's company six tonnes of fertiliser in May. The newspaper Verdens Gang reported that after Breivik bought a small quantity of an explosive primer from an online shop in Poland, his name was among 60 passed to the Police Security Service (PST) by the Norwegian Customs Service as having used the store to buy products. Speaking to the newspaper, Jon Fitje of PST said the information they found gave no indication of anything suspicious. He sets the cost of the preparations for the attacks at ‚Ç¨317,000 ‚Äì \\"130,000 out of pocket and 187,500 euros in lost revenue over three years.\\" Breivik's farmer neighbour described him as looking like a \\"city dweller, who wore expensive shirts and who knew nothing about rural ways\\". Breivik had also covered up the windows of his house. The owner of a local bar, who once worked as a profiler of passengers' body language at Oslo Airport, said there was nothing unusual about Breivik, who was an occasional customer at the bar.\\"Der Terrorist und die Brandstifter\\". Der Spiegel 1 August 2011 The attacks Oslo city centre, shortly after Breivik's ANFO car bomb detonated Flowers laid in front of Oslo Cathedral the day after the attacks On 22 July 2011, Breivik detonated a fertilizer bomb outside the tower block housing the office of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg in Oslo, resulting in eight deaths. Within a few hours of the explosion he travelled to Ut√∏ya island, the site of a camp for Worker's Youth League, posing as a police officer in order to take the ferry to the island, and then fired intermittently for more than one hour, killing 69 with one murder victim as young as 14 years old.\\"Police List\\" , Norway, 29 July 2011 Arrest When the police tactical unit Delta (based in Oslo) arrived on the island and confronted him, he surrendered without resistance. After his arrest, he was held by armed police on the island, and interrogated throughout the night, before being moved to a holding cell in Oslo. Breivik admitted to the crimes and said the purpose of the attack was to save Norway and Western Europe from a Muslim takeover, and that the Labour Party had to \\"pay the price\\" for \\"letting down Norway and the Norwegian people.\\" After his arrest, Breivik referred to himself as \\"the greatest monster since Quisling.\\"Grivi, Jarle Brenna et al. \\"I'm the greatest monster since Quisling: This said Breivik under interrogation at Ut√∏ya\\", Verdens Gang, 2 January 2012. (accessed 18 November 2015). Booking and preparations for trial On the way to his first jail meeting, Breivik's police escort was met with an angry crowd, some of whom shouted \\"burn in hell\\" or \\"traitor\\", while others used stronger words. R. Andresen: \\"We have no more information than ... what has been found on (his) own websites, which is that is goes toward the right (wing) and that it is, so to speak, Christian fundamentalist.\\" On 25 July 2011, Breivik was charged with violating paragraph 147a of the Norwegian criminal code, \\"destabilising or destroying basic functions of society\\" and \\"creating serious fear in the population\\", both of which are acts of terrorism under Norwegian law. He was ordered held for eight weeks, the first four in solitary confinement, pending further court proceedings. The custody was extended in subsequent hearings. The indictment was ready in early March 2012. The Director of Public Prosecutions had initially decided to censor the document to the public, leaving out the names of the victims as well as details about their deaths. Due to the public's reaction, this decision was reversed prior to its release. On 30 March, the Borgarting Court of Appeal announced that it had scheduled the expected appeal case for 15 January 2013. It would be heard in the same specially-constructed courtroom where the initial criminal case was tried. Breivik was kept at Ila Prison after arrest. There, he had at his disposal three prison cells: one where he could rest, sleep, and watch DVD movies or television, a second that was set up for him to use a PC without Internet connection, and a third with gym equipment. Only selected prison staff with special qualifications were allowed to work around him, and the prison management aimed to not let his presence as a high-security prisoner affect any of the other inmates. Subsequent to the January 2012 lifting of letters and visitors censorship for Breivik, he received several inquiries from private individuals, and he devoted his time to writing back to like- minded people. According to one of his attorneys, Breivik was curious to learn whether his manifesto has begun to take root in society. Breivik's attorneys, in consultation with Breivik, considered whether to have some of his interlocutors called as witnesses during the trial. Several media, both Norwegian and international, have requested interviews with Breivik. The first such was cancelled by the prison administration following a background check of the journalist in question. A second interview was agreed to by Breivik, and the prison requested a background check to be done by the police in the country where the journalist is from. No information has been given about the media organisations in question. Psychiatric evaluation Breivik underwent his first examination by court-appointed forensic psychiatrists in 2011. The psychiatrists diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia, concluding that he had developed the disorder over time and was psychotic both when he carried out the attacks and during the observation. He was also diagnosed with abuse of non-dependence-producing substances antecedent of 22 July. The psychiatrists consequently found Breivik to be criminally insane. According to the report, Breivik displayed inappropriate and blunted affect and a severe lack of empathy. He spoke incoherently in neologisms and had acted compulsively based on a universe of bizarre, grandiose and delusional thoughts. Breivik alluded to himself as the future regent of Norway, master of life and death, while calling himself \\"inordinately loving\\" and \\"Europe's most perfect knight since WWII\\". He was convinced that he was a warrior in a \\"low intensity civil war\\" and had been chosen to save his people. Breivik described plans to carry out further \\"executions of categories A, B and C traitors\\" by the thousands, the psychiatrists included, and to organize Norwegians in reservations for the purpose of selective breeding. Breivik believed himself to be the \\"knight Justiciar grand master\\" of a Templar organisation. He was deemed to be suicidal and homicidal by the psychiatrists. According to his defence attorney, Breivik initially expressed surprise and felt insulted by the conclusions in the report. He later said \\"this provides new opportunities\\". The outcome of Breivik's first competency evaluation was fiercely debated in Norway by mental health experts, over the court-appointed psychiatrists' opinion and the country's definition of criminal insanity. An extended panel of experts from the Norwegian Board of Forensic Medicine reviewed the submitted report and approved it \\"with no significant remarks\\". News in the meantime emerged that the psychiatric medical staff in charge of treating prisoners at Ila Detention and Security Prison did not make any observations that suggested he suffered from either psychosis, depression or was suicidal. According to senior psychiatrist Randi Rosenqvist, who was commissioned by the prison to examine Breivik, he rather appeared to have personality disorders. Counsels representing families and victims filed requests that the court order a second opinion, while the prosecuting authority and Breivik's lawyer initially did not want new experts to be appointed. On 13 January 2012, after much public pressure, the Oslo District Court ordered a second expert panel to evaluate Breivik's mental state.SPIEGEL Magazine Court Orders New Psychiatric Review for Breivik He initially refused to cooperate with new psychiatrists. He later changed his mind and in late February a new period of psychiatric observation, this time using different methods than the first period, was begun. If the original diagnosis had been upheld by the court, it would have meant that Anders Behring Breivik could not be sentenced to a prison term. The prosecution could instead have requested that he be detained in a psychiatric hospital. Medical advice would then have determined whether or not the courts decided to release him at some later point. If considered a perpetual danger to society, Breivik could have been kept in confinement for life. Shortly after the second period of pre-trial psychiatric observation was begun, the prosecution said it expected Breivik would be declared legally insane. On 10 April 2012, the second psychiatric evaluation was published with the conclusion that Breivik was not psychotic during the attacks and he was not psychotic during their evaluation. Instead, they diagnosed antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder. Breivik expressed hope at being declared sane in a letter sent to several Norwegian newspapers shortly before his trial, he wrote about the prospect of being sent to a psychiatric ward: \\"I must admit this is the worst thing that could have happened to me as it is the ultimate humiliation. To send a political activist to a mental hospital is more sadistic and evil than to kill him! It is a fate worse than death.\\" On 8 June 2012, Professor of Psychiatry Ulrik Fredrik Malt testified in court as an expert witness, saying he found it unlikely that Breivik had schizophrenia. According to Malt, Breivik primarily suffered from Asperger syndrome, Tourette syndrome, narcissistic personality disorder and possibly paranoid psychosis.Psykiater mener Breivik har Aspergers og Tourettes , V√•rt Land Malt cited a number of factors in support of his diagnoses, including deviant behaviour as a child, extreme specialization in Breivik's study of weapons and bomb technology, strange facial expression, a remarkable way of talking, and an obsession with numbers. Eirik Johannesen disagreed, concluding that Breivik was lying and was not delusional or psychotic. Johannesen had observed and spoken to Breivik for more than 20 hours.  Pre-trial hearing  In the pre-trial hearing, February 2012, Breivik read a prepared statement demanding to be released and treated as a hero for his \\"pre-emptive attack against traitors\\" accused of planning cultural genocide. He said, \\"They are committing, or planning to commit, cultural destruction, including deconstruction of the Norwegian ethnic group and deconstruction of Norwegian culture. This is the same as ethnic cleansing.\\" Criminal trial and conviction The criminal trial of Breivik began on 16 April 2012 in Oslo Courthouse under the jurisdiction of Oslo District Court. The appointed prosecutors were Inga Bejer Engh and Svein Holden with Geir Lippestad serving as Breivik's lead counsel for the defence. Closing arguments were held on 22 June. On 24 August 2012, Breivik was adjudged sane and sentenced to containment‚Äîa special form of a prison sentence that can be extended indefinitely; with an approximate period of 21 years and a minimum time of 10 years, the maximum penalty in Norway. Breivik did not appeal and on 8 September media announced that the verdict was final. The court said \\"many people share Breivik's conspiracy theory, including the Eurabia theory. The court finds that very few people, however, share Breivik's idea that the alleged 'Islamisation' should be fought with terror.\\" Prison life The entrance of Telemark Prison's affiliate in Skien in 2009. (The sign says \\"Corrections Service/ Skien Prison\\") Since August 2011, Breivik has been imprisoned in an SHS section (a prison section with \\"particularly high security\\"‚Äîs√¶rlig h√∏y sikkerhet). Between the inception of SHS, in 2002, and 2016 Norway had only imprisoned ten or eleven prisoners under these conditions, of which Breivik's term has been the longest. He is imprisoned at Telemark Prison's Skien Department, about southwest of Oslo. On 23 July 2012 he transferred from Ila Detention and Security Prison in B√¶rum to Skien; on 28 September 2012 he transferred back to Ila; since September 2013 he has been back at Telemark. Since 2015 or March 2014https://www.nrk.no/norge/_-besoksvennen-en-profesjonell-aktor-1.13327484 \\"[...] bes√∏ksvennen, som har bes√∏kt Breivik i fengselet siden mars 2014, er en profesjonell akt√∏r, og at Kriminalomsorgen har betalt totalt 164.000 kroner for bes√∏ksvennen per 1. januar 2016.\\" Breivik has received visits from a prison visitor ‚Äî a military chaplain (ranked major) ‚Äî every two weeks; this visitor has been paid 164,000 Norwegian kroner, by the government as of 1 January 2016, in regard to [visiting] Breivik.https://www.nrk.no/norge/_-besoksvennen-en-profesjonell- aktor-1.13327484 \\"bes√∏ksvennen, som har bes√∏kt Breivik i fengselet siden mars 2014, er en profesjonell akt√∏r, og at Kriminalomsorgen har betalt totalt 164.000 kroner for bes√∏ksvennen per 1. januar 2016.\\" His mother visited him five times before her death in 2013 and researcher Mattias Gardell interviewed Breivik in 2014, but no other visitors requested by Breivik have been granted access. He is isolated from the other inmates, and only has contact with health care workers and guards. The type of isolation that Breivik has experienced in prison is what the ECtHR calls relative social isolation, according to a verdict of 2016 in Oslo District Court. In Europe it is not uncommon to grant compensatory measures to prisoners that are being held in isolation for several years. , he has an electric typewriter and an Xbox (without internet connection) in his cell. Previously, when the original verdict was upheld in September 2012, his permission for access to a computer (without internet) in his prison cell ended. He has been enrolled since 2015 in the bachelor's degree program in political science at the University of Oslo; he passed two courses that year; \\"13. januar 2017 kl. 15:02 [...] forteller at Breivik begynte p√• bachelor i statsvitenskap h√∏sten 2015, da han tok emnene offentlig politikk og administrasjon, samt politisk teori. Han fikk C p√• begge emnene\\" he does not have internet access. In 2015 he claimed in a letter that harsh prison conditions had forced him to drop out of the course. According to a March 2016 statement by his lawyer, , Breivik had become a Nazi in prison. Political activity and attempts at correspondence In 2012, Breivik planned to set up an organisation he called the Conservative Revolutionary Movement which he envisioned consisting of around 50 right-wing activists in Europe, as well as an organization for imprisoned right-wing activists; Breivik has written to, among others, Peter Mangs and Beate Zsch√§pe.The newspaper Verdens Gang reported on 26 July 2012 In 2012 he spent 8‚Äì10 hours per day writing. He has said that he wants to write three books: the first being his own account of the events on the day of the attacks, the second discussing the ideology underlying his actions, and a third on his visions for the future. Since 2013 Breivik has been held at Telemark Prison. As with all convicts his letters are vetted before sending to prevent further crimes or hate attacks. After he came to Skien Prison, 5 out of 300 letters that he had sent had not been confiscated, he testified in court in 2016. He added, \\"Of the 200 forms regarding prison visits that I have mailed, all have been confiscated.\\" By 2016 around 4,000 postal items had been sent to or from Breivik, and about 15 percent of these (600 items) had been confiscated. On 11 March 2016 political scientist Ingeborg Kjos was copied in on a letter from Breivik to the Ministry of Justice that had taken over a year and a half to reach her; the letter did not advocate violence. Politicians from several Norwegian parties have protested Breivik's activities in prison, which they see as him continuing to expose his ideology and possibly encouraging further criminal acts. Complaints about prison conditions In November 2012, Breivik wrote a 27-page letter of complaint to the prison authorities about the security restrictions he was being held under, claiming that the prison director personally wanted to punish him. Among his complaints were that his cell is not adequately heated and he has to wear three layers of clothing to stay warm, guards interfere with his strictly-planned daily schedule, his cell is poorly decorated and has no view, his reading lamp is inadequate, guards supervise him while he is brushing his teeth and shaving and put indirect mental pressure on him to finish quickly by tapping their feet while waiting, he is \\"not having candy\\" and is served cold coffee, and he is strip-searched daily, sometimes by female guards. Authorities only lifted one minor restriction against Breivik; his rubber safety pen, which he described as an \\"almost indescribable manifestation of sadism,\\" was replaced with an ordinary pen. In letters to foreign media outlets he told about his demands (in 2013) to prison authorities \\"including easier communication with the outside world and a PlayStation 3 to replace the current PlayStation 2, because it offers more suitable games\\"; media reported in 2014 about demands that he would starve himself to death if refused \\"access to a sofa and a bigger gym\\"; furthermore he said that \\"Other inmates have access to adult games while I only have the right to play less interesting kids' games. One example is \\"Rayman Revolution\\", a game aimed at three year-olds,\\" Breivik complained to prison officials.\\" In September 2015, Breivik again threatened a hunger strike, because of deteriorating prison conditions, but delayed in order to sue the Norwegian Government over prison conditions.  Civil trial against Norway's government  During 15‚Äî18 March 2016, Breivik was the plaintiff in a civil trial against the government. The verdict was appealed; the appellate court rendered its verdict, and the supreme court decided not to hear the case.\\"Judgment in the appeal case between The Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Breivik\\"Judgment (case number 16-111749ASD-BORG/02) Breivik sued the government over his solitary confinement, and his general conditions of imprisonment, including a claim of an excessive use of handcuffs. Breivik claimed that his solitary confinement violated his human rights and asserted that he had been subjected to \\"degrading treatment, including hundreds of strip searches and frequent searches of his cell, including at night.\\" The Parliamentary Ombudsman had previously reported that the regimen for serving a prison sentence at the level of particularly high security\\" constitutes a heightened risk of inhumane treatment. The Oslo District Court refused (twice) to allow the press to join a walk-through of Breivik's prison cell. The second request had included the suggestion that one person, with a gagging order in place, could represent the entire press corps, while joining the walk-through. On 8 March, media said that parts of the trial proceedings would be closed to the general public, according to a decision by Oslo District Court, which upheld its previous ruling. On 14 March, members of the court performed a walk-through of prison cells used by Breivik at Ila Prison; later the same week the members of the court inspected the prison facilities used by Breivik at Skien Prison. On 15 March, Oslo District Court convened inside Skien Prison. Upon arrival, after police removed his handcuffs, Breivik shook hands with his lawyers, and thereafter faced the gallery and performed a Nazi-style salute; one judge said that Breivik's salute seems disruptive, \\"therefore I wish that you don't do it again\\".https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/ejd5R/skjeggete-breivik-viste- nazi-hilsen \\"virker forstyrrende, s√• det √∏nsker jeg ikke at du gj√∏r igjen, sier lagdommer √òystein Hermansen.\\" A lawyer from the Office of the Attorney General said that of Breivik's incoming and outgoing mail, through the postal system, around 15 percent (or 600 pieces of mail out of around 4,000) had been confiscated. √òystein Storrvik, the head of Breivik's legal team, told the court about Breivik's letter of complaint to the government in 2012 which detailed being awakened by flashlight as often as every half-hour. Breivik's testimony On 16 March, Breivik started his testimony, \\"to give his view on the strict prison regimen [that he is exposed to] and any damage done to his health while in prison as a cause of isolation\\". He reported having been handcuffed 3,500 times. The main points of his testimony were: *He had been subjected to a \\"grip manoeuvre\\" 2,300 times‚Äîwhere he put his hands through the slot of the door to his prison cell, and his hands had been held in place by a prison officer while the door has been swung open. Breivik described these two forms of \\"extra punishment\\", saying: \\"it is quite demeaning to be exposed to this every day, so I countered by not leaving my prison cell. I did not want to exercise in the fresh air, [I did not want to] train, or use my study [prison-] cell.\\" *On paper he had three prison cells, but because of the government's actions he hardly used the training cell and the study cell. *Prison officers at Ila Prison were not to speak to him during his [first] stay there, and this was the case for parts of his stay at Skien [prison]; only the chief of the section was supposed to speak to Breivik. Furthermore, Breivik said that Breivik had not said \\"no\\" to the prison offering him activities such as playing floorball or chess, but asked to be offered other activities. He said that starting in March 2014 he finally received the one hour of fellowship with prison officers; he said that claims had been made that he was allowed to prepare food, but that he was permitted only to press an egg cooker, and was not permitted to put frozen pizza in the oven‚Äîthat he had only done once. *He still received a prison visitor twice a month‚Äîan officer of the Norwegian Armed Forces. *Regarding recreation in fresh air, Breivik said: \\"Until December 2015 all outdoors recreation was in a concrete box. In December 2015, probably because of the upcoming trial, I was permitted to walk 20 minutes in the outdoors recreation area. A couple of times later I was permitted [again]. Thereafter I was permitted to recreate there every other week.\\" *Regarding being awoken at night, Breivik said: \\"There are inspections through the slot [of the door to the prison cell] every 40 minutes. Every time the slot was opened they demanded a sign of life. They wanted me to shake a leg every time the slot opened\\". He felt humiliated that the prison officers made such a demand and said \\"They shined a flashlight into the bed, depending on the prison officer. Called into the cell Are you alive, are you alive, until I woke up. Then they had the sign of life that they needed. Countless times I was awoken at night.\\" *After he came to Skien Prison, only 5 out of 300 letters that Breivik sent, had not been confiscated. He added, \\"Of the 200 forms regarding prison visits that I have mailed, all have been confiscated.\\" *In 2015 he was told that he would be locked into an isolation cell for 23 hours a day; the decision was reversed in December 2015, weeks after the visit by the Parliamentary Ombudsman. *Breivik said that \\"Dark film on all the windows has prevented natural light, and it is not possible to see anything outside during large parts of the winter months of the year.\\" *Breivik testified about how the authorities prevent him from buying postage stamps, and how Skien Prison has confiscated envelopes [where the stamps are] worth several thousand Norwegian kroner. *Breivik told about having to wait a long time after having asked for [the prison officers to present his] toothbrush, or asked [the prison officers] about turning off the TV switch; \\"This low-level terrorising continued for two years until\\" his transfer to Skien [prison]. *Breivik testified that he had to drink cold coffee because he was not permitted to have a thermos; Breivik has also complained about announcements over the PA system at Ila, including that each message was repeated such as Now it's time for outdoors recreation, it's time for outdoors recreation; the PA system was eventually switched off in Breivik's section [at the prison]. *Breivik says that he had not been permitted to publish his correct mailing address. *Breivik said that \\"It is important that Oslo District Court says what types of addressees [pertaining to the postal system] are permissible.\\" He added that media [outlets] that he has access to are Aftenposten, Dagen, TA and Varden, and broadcast Teletext on several channels; he would read other newspapers if he had such access, \\"Klassekampen is perhaps even more interesting than Aftenposten.\\" *Breivik testified that after two years in isolation he has started to love Paradise Hotel, which he says is evidence that he has become seriously brain damaged. *Breivik said that \\"Isolation is the most effective way to radicalise people because one never gets corrected by others.\\" *Breivik talked about the parties NFP and NL; he said that those later changed name to [\\"Nordic State\\" or] Nordiske stat. Cross-examination of witnesses The first witness, Randi Rosenqvist, a psychiatrist at Ila Prison, was cross-examined by Storrvik. Storrvik asked if she had suggested visits without a glass wall; Rosenqvist replied: \\"Yes I have discussed this. I have been thinking that visits without a glass wall could be something [to consider]. I don't think that with his image, he would be violent to someone he has [some sort of] a [working-] relationship to.\\" Storrvik read out loud, recommendations by Rosenqvist, including \\"Retired police officers could, for example, come [to socialise with Breivik], drink coffee, play games\\". At the start of the third day of the trial, Storrvik introduced a report from the \\"prevention section\\" at [the office of] the Parliamentary Ombudsman, dated 11 November 2015, regarding a series of visits that year by the ombudsman; the report said that Breivik was being held at a section where sometimes there was only one prisoner. Storrvik read from the report that \\"The limitations on visits at the time of the inspection [by the Parliamentary Ombudsman] seemed quite strict\\". He said that in that section of the prison, it should expand the planned community between prisoners and employees and consider other measures to minimise the risk of isolation damage. At that section the prison should evaluate alternative possibilities for recreation in fresh air, in addition to the concrete exercise yard. The report recommended that the prison should discontinue the visual surveillance of health-related conversations that occur with a glass wall between prisoner and health personnel. (The Parliamentary Ombudsman was called as a witness, however no one from the office was forced to testify in court, and no one from that office testified.) The second witness was Knut Bjarkeid, Chief Warden at Ila Prison. Storrvik confronted Bjarkeid with a document regarding [prison] Section G being turned [in part] into a \\"particularly high security department\\". He read: \\"There are obvious limits to how long he can be in Section G\\"; the document was written by Bjarkeid. Storrvik said that \\"The words are here, obviously there are limits to how long he shall be isolated. This was in 2012. He is still in total isolation\\". After Bjarkeid left the witness stand, Emberland read out loud from a letter that Breivik had written, dated 29 September 2013; in the letter Breivik reported several persons to the police; the Asker and B√¶rum Police District investigated and later dropped the investigation; Breivik's letter detailed the number of strip searches, \\"grip manoeuvres\\", and handcuffings he had undergone. The third witness was Bj√∏rn Draugedalen, a general practitioner working one day per week at Skien Prison. His first consultation with Breivik was held in a recreation room in avdeling for s√¶rlig h√∏y sikkerhet, a high-security unit. Draugedalen shook hands with Breivik, with five prison officers present; all the later consultations (until the trial) were held with a glass wall separating them. Storrvik asked \\"This change, when another prisoner arrived [and started to live in the same prison section], which resulted in Breivik's movement being restricted‚Äîdid you consider to go up there to view [his living conditions or] how things were\\"?; Draugedalen answered \\"We have to deal with changes done by the Corrections Services\\". The judge interjected, and she said that the Correction Services likely would listen to health care workers; Draugedalen replied that \\"We did not see any extra value then, regarding visiting him in the [prison] section\\". At 12:36 Draugedalen said that he has not been notified that Breivik has discontinued his [college/university] studies. The fourth witness was Haukeland, an MD for prisoners at Ila Prison. At 13:46 Storrvik read from [Breivik's medical] record dated 5 February 2013 that Breivik intends to recreate less in fresh air because of the strip searches that follow; Storrvik asked Haukeland: \\"The fact that he goes outside less, to avoid being strip searched, was that discussed as a problem?; Haukeland answered \\"No, that was not discussed [among the health care workers or] in the health section\\". At 13:51 the judge referred to nightly inspections every half hour, and Haukeland answers that he cannot remember; the judge asked \\"Were you the ones who recommended that\\"?; Haukeland replied \\"No (...)\\". The next witness was Margit Kise, a section leader at Skien Prison. The sixth witness was Tore Stenshagen, also a section leader at Skien, who served during the third quarter of 2015. Stenshagen testified that sometimes he sits down [in Breivik's cell] and talks with Breivik, and sometimes they are accompanied by only one prison officer. The last witness of the day was J√∏rgen Spangen Iversen, an advisor at the Correctional Agency.https://www.adressa.no/nyheter/innenriks/2016/03/17/Har- ikke-full-oversikt-over-alle-brevene-til-og-fra-Breivik-12296844.ece \\"Dagens siste vitne i retten var [...] J√∏rgen Spangen Iversen\\" Iversen was asked why Breivik was transferred to Skien rather than to Ringerike Prison; Iversen answered that he became a case-worker in 2014, and he was not involved in the transfer. Closing arguments Summing up the case for Breivik, Storrvik said: \\"For some reason, in Norway it has been established that in a female prison, a male prison officer cannot strip search a prisoner, but in a male prison it is ok that females are present. This is offensive‚ÄîI do not see any alternatives\\". He then talked about the case of strip searches of prisoner Piechowicz in Poland. In that case the court was not convinced by the Polish government's arguments that the systematic, humiliating, daily searches were necessary to secure the prison. He continued: \\"He was also awoken at night, but he had 147 visits that compensated\\", and Piechowicz's isolation lasted for a shorter period; Storrvik said: \\"Note that one calls it isolation, even though he had one cellmate\\". Storrvik said that \\"the verdict [of] Piechowicz vs. Poland point to a breach of EMK in our case\\". Storrvik said: \\"In my opinion there is not a complete concurrence between risk analyses and measures in our case. Risk analyses have at an early stage come with suggestions for measures [and these have not been followed up] (...) For example, removing the glass wall during visits and the possibility of introducing fellow prisoner, has been discussed at such an early stage that there should be a good reason for why Rosenqvist's advice has not been followed\\". Storrvik said that \\"The main problem for the government in this case is that the discrepancies between well-founded‚Äîin the context of security‚Äîsuggestions from one of those who knows this case the best has not been followed\\".Breivik suing the government \\"Storrvik: ‚Äì Hovedproblemet for Staten i denne saken her er avvik mellom sikkerhetsmessige, godt funderte forslag fra en av dem som kjenner denne saken aller best, ikke er fulgt.\\" Storrvik compared Breivik's position as a Catch-22 situation: if Breivik says that he has psychiatric problems, then he has picked them out of a book; if he says that he doesn't have psychiatric problems, then he doesn't have psychiatric problems. Storrvik said that there had been no inspections by agencies tasked with oversight, as far as he knew, until the Parliamentary Ombudsman came. Breivik's lawyer referred to anal inspections [‚Äîvisual or manual body cavity searches]; he disagreed with Emberland's view that there was a difference regarding anal inspection as referred to in ECHR verdicts in other cases, and the squats that Breivik must perform while naked; Storrvik's opinion is that Ila lacks concrete reasons for all the inspections. Mestad said that \\"The government's primary task is to protect its citizens. To let a convicted terrorist establish a network, is dangerous\\". Storrvik said Breivik's [previous] verdict \\"indicates a mental vulnerability. If that is not enough, Breivik appears‚Äîby my standards‚Äîconfused in court\\". Storrvik added that [in his usage] \\"mental vulnerability is a very, very weak expression\\". Emberland said that \\"Storrvik is quoting from the dissenting opinions from verdicts of the ECHR\\"‚Äîat least as much as he is quoting the majority opinions of the verdicts. On 18 March 2016 after the court was adjourned, the room where the trial had been held was turned back into the prison gymnasium. Reactions (out of court) to Breivik's testimony Breivik's testimony about his ideology was described as incoherent. In Dagbladet, Aina Sundt Gullhaugen (research advisor and psychologist) said about prison superintendent Bjarkeid's opinion that Breivik is not one of the prisoners at Ila suffering [from isolation]: \\"And surely it is an ugly sight when humans in the basement at Ila smear feces on the walls and no longer are oriented about themselves, time or place. But those who think that Breivik is not suffering have made themselves unavailable for the documented pain that Anders partook in [during childhood] ... The problem is that Breivik ... expresses his affliction in a manner that does not get captured particularly well by diagnostics manuals. The type of fundamental relational and emotional deficiencies that Breivik was allowed to develop, usually results in that person ending up speaking a language that others don't recognise\\". In Aftenposten, Ulrik Fredrik Malt [expert witness at the 2012 trial] said that \\"the mass murderer is mentally quite ill, and that's being undercommunicated\\".  Verdict  On 20 April 2016 District Court Judge Helen Anden√¶s Sekulic gave her verdict. The verdict said that the conditions of his imprisonment breached Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, but that Article 8 of the Convention had not been violated‚Äîconfiscation of letters had been justified. The government was also ordered to pay Norwegian kroner 330,937.5 ($40,373)using a April 2016 conversion rate for the plaintiff's legal expenses incurred by the court case. (Breivik could not receive the money, but his lawyer could upon the verdict being upheld.) Breivik was not in any courtroom when he received the verdict; media said that his copy would be faxed [to the prison]. Reactions to verdict On 21 April 2016 news media said that Ole Kristoffer Borhaug (the fengselsleder at Telemark Prison of which Skien Prison is an affiliate) said that the prison regimen for Breivik would not be lightened, in part because the verdict has not been officially upheld, and there are regulations preventing high security prisoners from interacting with prisoners of other categories. Other reactions to the verdict include those of former convicts: Kjell Alrich Schumann said that the verdict is most importantly about the principles regarding the application of isolation in Norwegian prisons; he added that \\"The decisions are evaluated by an entity at Correctional Service every six months, and they can use any kinds of arguments. There is no oversight\\"; Sven-Eirik Utsi said that \\"One can say whatever one wants about Breivik ... but isolation [is something] Norway has been criticised about for several decades [by the ECtHR]\\". The government's chief lawyer in the trial, Marius Emberland, had voiced his opinion about the verdict before the appeal; his opinion was criticized by the leader of the Norwegian Judges' Association, Ingjerd Thune: \\"I clearly understand that many react. I have never heard a lawyer speak in that manner‚Äîever. That was surprising\\"; lawyer Frode Sulland said that one gets the impression that Office of the Attorney General \\"does not respect the justice system, and they still think that they are right, even when the court thinks they are wrong\\"; Emberland eventually recognised that some of his verbal comments can be interpreted as arrogant, adding that \\"They really weren't meant that way\\". Legal scholar Mads Anden√¶s, said that \\"The appeal has no bearing on the responsibility of the government to evaluate and make the changes that the verdict of Oslo District Court imposes the government to do. This results directly from Norwegian Law and practices of ECtHR\\". Regarding the question of [possibly] moving Breivik to a prison with other SHS-prisoners, Telemark Prison's director, Ole Kristoffer Borhaug, said that the question is the responsibility of the Correctional Service's \\"Region South\\". Loss on appeal On 5 August, media said that Storrvik claims that the judge [scheduled to rule in the trial] is partial; the judge was recused. The appeal was heard in Borgarting Court of Appeal (convening within the prison), starting 10 January 2017; Breivik came to court without handcuffs. The verdict, handed down on 1 March 2017,\\"Judgment in the appeal case between The Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Breivik\\"Judgment (case number 16-111749ASD-BORG/02) stated that solitary confinement did not violate Breivik's rights, and all recommendations were voided. On 8 June 2017, Norway's Supreme Court decided not to hear the case. Financing of legal aid; family situation , Breivik is still receiving pro bono legal aid from the law firm of √òystein Storrvik; previously the firm of Geir Lippestad did pro bono representation of Breivik (after the 2012 trial). Legal aid during criminal trials has been paid by the government, as is the norm in the country. On 23 March 2013, Breivik's mother died from complications from cancer. On the same day media said that mother and son \\"took farewell during a meeting at Ila last week. Breivik was permitted to move himself out from behind the glass wall of the visit room‚Äîto give his mother a farewell hug\\". Breivik had asked for permission by the prison officials to attend his mother's funeral service; the request was rejected. Writings and video Forums and Youtube Janne Kristiansen, then Chief of the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST), said Breivik \\"deliberately desisted from violent exhortations on the net [and] has more or less been a moderate, and has neither been part of any extremist network.\\" He is reported to have written many posts on the Islam-critical website document.no. He also attended a meeting of \\"Documents venner\\" (Friends of Document), affiliated with the website, in late 2009. Due to the media attention on his Internet activity following the 2011 attacks, document.no compiled a complete list of comments made by Breivik on its website between September 2009 and June 2010. A Dagens N√¶ringsliv article said that Breivik sought to start a Norwegian version of the Tea Party movement in cooperation with the owners of document.no, but that they, after expressing initial interest, turned down his proposal because he did not have the contacts he promised. Six hours before the attacks, Breivik posted a picture of himself as a Knight Templar officer in a uniform festooned with a gold aiguillette and multiple medals he had not been awarded. In the video he put an animation depicting Islam as a trojan horse in Europe. The video, which promotes fighting against Islam, shows Breivik wearing a wetsuit and holding an automatic weapon. Manifesto: 2083: A European Declaration of Independence Content Breivik prepared a document titled 2083: A European Declaration of Independence. It has 1,518 pages, credited to \\"Andrew Berwick\\" (the Anglicized name of Anders Behring Breivik). Breivik admitted in court that it was mostly other people's writings he had copied and pasted from different websites. The file was e-mailed to 1,003 addresses about 90 minutes before the bomb blast in Oslo. The document describes two years of preparation of unspecified attacks, supposedly planned for late 2011, involving a rented Volkswagen Crafter van (small enough not to require a truck driving licence) loaded with of ammonium nitrate/fuel oil explosive (ANFO), a Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic rifle, a Glock 34 pistol, personal armour including a shield, caltrops, and police insignias. It also reports that Breivik spent thousands of hours gathering email addresses from Facebook for distribution of the document, and that he rented a farm as a cover for a fake farming company buying fertilizer (3 tons for producing explosives and 3 tons of a harmless kind to avoid suspicion) and as a lab. It describes burying a crate with the armour in the woods in July 2010, collecting it on 4 July 2011, and abandoning his plan to replace it with survival gear because he did not have a second pistol. It also expresses support for far-right groups such as the English Defence League and paramilitaries such as the Scorpions. In the introductory chapter of the manifesto defining \\"cultural Marxism\\" in the Frankfurt School conspiracy theory sense is a copy of Political Correctness: A Short History of an Ideology by Paul Weyrich's Free Congress Foundation. Major parts of the compendium are attributed to the pseudonymous Norwegian blogger Fjordman. The text also copies sections of the Unabomber manifesto, without giving credit, while replacing the words \\"leftists\\" with \\"cultural Marxists\\" and \\"black people\\" with \\"muslims\\". The New York Times described American influences in the writings, noting that the compendium mentions the anti-Islamist American Robert Spencer 64 times and cites Spencer's works at great length. The work of Bat Ye'or is frequently cited. Conservative blogger Pamela Geller is also mentioned as a source of inspiration. Breivik blames feminism for allowing the erosion of the fabric of European society and advocates a restoration of patriarchy which he claims would save European culture. India, and in particular Hindu nationalism, figures repeatedly in the manifesto where he expresses praise and admiration for Hindu nationalist groups. He claimed to have attempted to reach out to Indians through email & Facebook.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Norway-killers-pro- Hindutva-rant-has-Sangh- squirming/articleshow/9376574.cmshttps://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia- Pacific/2011/0725/Norway-massacre-Breivik-manifesto-attempts-to-woo-India-s- Hindu-nationalists In his writings Breivik also states that he wants to see European policies on multiculturalism and immigration more similar to those of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan\\"Norway killer Anders Behring Breivik's cultural references\\".

The Daily Telegraph. 24 July 2011. He expressed his admiration for the \\"monoculturalism\\" of Japan and for Japan and South Korea's refusal to accept refugees.\\"Breivik looked up to Japanese 'monoculturalism'\\". The Tokyo Times. 25 July 2011.\\"Norway killer praises Japan as model country ‚Äì Kyodo\\". Reuters. 26 July 2011. The Jerusalem Post describes his support for Israel as a \\"far-right Zionism\\". He calls all \\"nationalists\\" to join in the struggle against \\"cultural Marxists/multiculturalists\\". He also expressed his admiration of the Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, finding him \\"a fair and resolute leader worthy of respect\\", though he was \\"unsure at this point whether he has the potential to be our best friend or our worst enemy.\\" Putin's spokesman Dmitri Peskov has denounced Breivik's actions as the \\"delirium of a madman\\". Analysis Benjamin R. Teitelbaum, former professor of Nordic Studies (current professor of musicology) at University of Colorado, argues that several parts of the manifesto suggest that Breivik was concerned about race, not only about Western culture or Christianity, labelling him as a white nationalist. Thomas Hegghammer of the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment has described the ideologies of Breivik as \\"not fitting the established categories of right-wing ideology, like white supremacism, ultranationalism or Christian fundamentalism\\", but more akin to macro-nationalism and a \\"new doctrine of civilisational war\\". Norwegian social scientist Lars Gule characterised Breivik as a \\"national conservative, not a Nazi\\".\\"Mein kleines Land gibt es nicht mehr\\" (in German). FAZ. 25 July 2011. Pepe Egger of the think-tank Exclusive Analysis says \\"the bizarre thing is that his ideas, as Islamophobic as they are, are almost mainstream in many European countries\\". In one section of the manifesto titled \\"Battlefield Wikipedia\\", Breivik explains the importance of using Wikipedia as a venue for disseminating views and information to the general public, although the Norwegian professor Arnulf Hagen claims that this was a document that he had copied from another author and that Breivik was unlikely to be a contributor to Wikipedia. According to the leader of the Norwegian chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation an account has been identified which they believe Breivik used. On the second day of his trial Breivik cited Wikipedia as the main source for his worldview. Influence Breivik's manifesto 2083: A European Declaration of Independence circulated in online fascist forums where strategies were set and tactics debated.Pein, Corey (2017) Live Work Work Die: A Journey into the Savage Heart of Silicon Valley. Metropolitan Books: Henry Holt and Co: New York. Page 235. In an essay called \\"Right-wing terrorism as folk activism,\\" neoreactionary blogger Curtis Yarvin wrote about Breivik, \\"No one who condones Che, Stalin, Mao, or any other leftist murderer, has any right to ask anyone else to dissociate himself from a rightist who didn't even make triple digits\\" (did not murder more than a hundred people).Yarvin, Curtis (23 July 2011) \\"Right-wing terrorism as folk activism.\\" Unqualified Reservations (blog). Australian terrorist Brenton Harrison Tarrant who killed 51 people (all Muslims) and injured 50 more during the Christchurch mosque shootings at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, mentioned Anders Behring Breivik in his manifesto The Great Replacement as one of the far-right mass murderers and killers he supports and said \\"But only really took true inspiration from Knight Justiciar Breivik\\" even going as far as to claim \\"brief contact\\" with him and his organization Knights' Templar. Beliefs Breivik had been active on several anti-Islamic and nationalist blogs, including document.no, and was a regular reader of Gates of Vienna, the Brussels Journal and Jihad Watch. Breivik has frequently praised the writings of blogger Fjordman. He used Fjordman's thinking to justify his actions, citing him 111 times in the manifesto. After studying several militant groups, including the IRA, ETA and others, Breivik suggests far-right militants should adopt al-Qaeda's methods, learn from their success, and avoid their mistakes. Breivik described al-Qaeda as the \\"most successful revolutionary force in the world\\" and praised their \\"cult of martyrdom\\". In a letter sent by Breivik to international media in January 2014, Breivik states that he exploited \\"counterjihadist\\" rhetoric in order to protect \\"ethno-nationalists\\" and start a media hunt against \\"anti-nationalist counterjihadist\\"-supporters, in a strategy he calls \\"double psychology\\". Breivik further states that he strives for a \\"pure Nordic ideal\\", advocating the establishment of a similar party in Norway to the (now-defunct) neo-Nazi Party of the Swedes, and identifying himself as a part of \\"Western Europe's fascist movement\\". Moreover, he states that his \\"support\\" for Israel is limited for it to function as a place to deport \\"disloyal Jews\\". During the trial in 2012, Breivik listed as his influences a number of neo-Nazi activists, as well as perpetrators of attacks against immigrants and leftists, considering them \\"heroes\\". Religious views Following his apprehension, Breivik was characterised by analysts as being a right-wing extremist with anti-Muslim views and a deep-seated hatred of Islam, who considered himself a knight dedicated to stemming the tide of Muslim immigration into Europe. At the same time, Breivik said both during his trial and in his manifesto to have been inspired by jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda, and stated his willingness to work with groups like al-Qaeda, al- Shabaab and Iran in order to conduct attacks with weapons of mass destruction against Western targets. He was at first described by many in the media as a Christian fundamentalist, Christian terrorist, and nationalist. He states that the European Union is a project to create \\"Eurabia\\"Doug Saunders, \\"Norway gunman's manifesto calls for war against Muslims\\", The Globe and Mail, 25 July 2011;Doug Saunders, \\"'Eurabia' opponents scramble for distance from anti- Muslim murderer\\", The Globe and Mail, 26 July 2011;Toby Archer, \\"Breivik's Swamp\\", Foreign Policy, 25 July 2011; and describes the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia as being authorised by \\"criminal western European and American leaders\\". In his writings Breivik states that \\"the Battle of Vienna in 1683 should be celebrated as the Independence Day for all Western Europeans as it was the beginning of the end for the second Islamic wave of Jihads\\".\\"Norway shootings: July 24 as it happened\\". The Daily Telegraph (London). 24 July 2011. The manifesto urges the Hindu nationalists to drive Muslims out of India. It demands the forced deportation of all Muslims from Europe, based on the model of the Bene≈° decrees. His religious faith is Odinism. While Breivik was frequently described as a \\"Christian fundamentalist\\", such assertion was disputed in a number of sources, and Breivik denied it, saying in letters to Norwegian newspaper Dagen that he \\"is not, and has never been a Christian\\", and that he thinks there are few things in the world more \\"pathetic\\" than \\"the Jesus-figure and his message\\". He said he prays and sacrifices to Odin, and identifies his religion as Odinism. Links to organizations Shooting club Breivik was an active member of an Oslo shooting club between 2005 and 2007, and since 2010. According to the club, which banned him for life after the attacks, Breivik had taken part in 13 organized training sessions and one competition since June 2010. The club states that it does not evaluate the members' suitability regarding possession of weapons. Freemasons At the time of the attacks, Breivik was a member of the Lodge of St. Olaf at the Three Columns in Oslo and had displayed photographs of himself in partial Masonic regalia on his Facebook profile. In interviews after the attacks, his lodge said it had only minimal contact with him, and that when made aware of Breivik's membership, Grand Master of the Norwegian Order of Freemasons, Ivar A. Skaar, issued an edict immediately excluding him from the fraternity based upon the acts he carried out and the values that appear to have motivated them. According to the Lodge records, Breivik took part in a total of four meetings between his initiation in February 2007 and his exclusion from the order (one each to receive the first, second, and third degrees, and one other meeting) and held no offices or functions within the Lodge. Skaar said that although Breivik was a member of the Order, his actions showed that he was in no way a Mason. Progress Party Breivik became a member of the Progress Party (FrP) in 1999. He paid his membership dues for the last time in 2004, and was removed from the membership lists in 2006. During his time in the Progress Party, he held two positions in the Progress Party's youth organisation FpU: he was the chair of the local Vest Oslo branch from January to October 2002, and a member of the board of the same branch from October 2002 till November 2004. After the attack, the Progress Party immediately distanced itself from Breivik's actions and ideas. At a 2013 press conference Ketil Solvik-Olsen said that Breivik \\"left us [the party] because we were too liberal\\". English Defence League (EDL) Breivik claimed he had contact with the far-right English Defence League (EDL), a movement in the United Kingdom that has been accused of Islamophobia. He allegedly had extensive links with senior EDL members and wrote that he attended an EDL demonstration in Bradford. On 26 July 2011, EDL leader Tommy Robinson denounced Breivik and his attacks and has denied any official links with him. On 31 July 2011, Interpol asked Maltese police to investigate Paul Ray, a former EDL member who blogs under the name \\"Lionheart.\\" Ray conceded that he may have been an inspiration for Breivik, but deplored his actions. In an online discussion on the Norwegian website Document.no on 6 December 2009, Breivik proposed to establish a Norwegian version of the EDL. Breivik saw this as the only way to stop left-wing radical groups like Blitz and SOS Rasisme from \\"harassing\\" Norwegian cultural conservatives. Following the establishment of the European Defence League, the Norwegian Defence League (NDL) launched in 2010. Breivik indeed became a member of this organization under the pseudonym \\"Sigurd Jorsalfar\\". Former head of the NDL, Lena Andreassen, claims that Breivik was ejected from the organization when she took over as leader in March 2011 because he was too extreme. Knights Templar In his manifesto and during interrogation, Breivik claimed membership in an \\"international Christian military order\\", which he calls the new Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Solomonici (PCCTS, Knights Templar). According to Breivik, the order was established as an \\"anti-Jihad crusader-organisation\\" that \\"fights\\" against \\"Islamic suppression\\" in London in April 2002 by nine men: two Englishmen, a Frenchman, a German, a Dutchman, a Greek, a Russian, a Norwegian (apparently Breivik), and a Serb (supposedly the initiator, not present, but represented by Breivik). The compendium gives a \\"2008 estimate\\" that there are between 15 and 80 \\"Justiciar Knights\\" in Western Europe, and an unknown number of civilian members, and Breivik expects the order to take political and military control of Western Europe. Breivik gives his own code name in the organisation as Sigurd and that of his assigned \\"mentor\\" as Richard, after the twelfth- century crusaders and kings Sigurd Jorsalfar of Norway and Richard the Lionheart of England. He calls himself a one-man cell of this organisation, and claims that the group has several other cells in Western countries, including two more in Norway. On 2 August 2011 Breivik offered to provide information about these cells, but on unrealistic preconditions. After an intense investigation assisted internationally by several security agencies, the Norwegian police have not found any evidence that a PCCTS network existed, or that the alleged 2002 London meeting ever took place. The police now view Breivik's claim as a figment of imagination in light of his schizophrenia diagnosis, and are increasingly confident that he had no accessories. The perpetrator still insists he belongs to an order and that his one-man cell was \\"activated\\" by another clandestine cell. On 14 August 2012, several Norwegian politicians and media outlets received an email from someone claiming to be Breivik's \\"deputy\\", demanding that Breivik be released, and making more threats against Norwegian society. Notable related books On 17 August 2013, journalist Marit Christensen informed the Norwegian press that for the last year of Wenche Behring Breivik's life, she had been her confidant, and that a book based on Christensen's interviews with her would be published as a book in late 2013 under the title The Mother. On 14 September 2013 Verdens Gang said that before Wenche Behring Breivik died, she hired a lawyer to prevent Christensen from publishing the book. The book was nevertheless published in October 2013, and was widely criticized; on the basis of Wenche Behring Breivik's opposition to the book, for inclusion of material not relevant to understanding what motivated Anders Behring Breivik, and for character assassinations of still living people. Norwegian author Unni Turrettini's bestselling book The Mystery of the Lone Wolf Killer: Anders Behring Breivik and the Threat of Terror in Plain Sight examines the mind of Breivik and the phenomenon of the lone wolf killer and how they manifest themselves, delving into criminal psychology. Turrettini discusses in her book how these \\"lone wolves\\" can be identified only by observation by the communities within which they attempt to form personal connections. The book was winner of the 2016 Killer Nashville Silver Falchion Winner for Best Nonfiction book.

Resolution Observations The Council again praised the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for their commitment towards the democratic process. It noted that 50 military observers temporarily re-deployed from the United Nations Operation in Burundi (ONUB) in accordance with resolutions 1669 (2006) and 1692 (2006) had successfully completed their mission and would be repatriated by December 31, 2006.

The melody of the song was used for the title song of the Disney film The Three Caballeros. Both songs have been recorded by many artists. Analysis The song envisions a romance between the Mexican state of Jalisco and its capital city of Guadalajara. In their book Writing Across Cultures: Narrative Transculturation in Latin America, √Ångel Rama and David Frye posit that the song portrays the common stereotype of Jalisco being \\"a paradigm of 'Mexicanness'. Though part of the ranchera genre, the song has the rhythmic patterns of a polka. Mariachis will often include the song in their repertoire, and in the Southwestern United States, a modified two-step associated with conjunto music may be danced to it. Versions The song has been covered by many different artists including Vicente Fern√°ndez, Pl√°cido Domingo, Lola Beltr√°n, Julio Iglesias, Tr√≠o Los Panchos, El Charro Gil y Sus Caporales, Francisco Canaro and Pedrito Fern√°ndez.Pedro Fern√°ndez Oficial Historia Texas A&M; University‚ÄìKingsville uses the song, under the name Jalisco as their official fight song. In 1962 John Buck & His Blazers had an instrumental hit in Germany and Austria with their version of \\"Jalisco\\". This success quickly inspired a German vocal version titled \\"Gaucho Mexicano\\" by Renate & Werner Leismann which turned out to be a smash hit in both countries. The song is featured in the 1943 film Here Comes Kelly. The 2012 film Mariachi Gringo, that sees a young American man travel to Mexico in the hopes of becoming a successful mariachi performer, features the song. The song is performed by the lead character, played by Shawn Ashmore. The Three Caballeros After the international success of Saludos Amigos, The Walt Disney Company set out to make a sequel, titled The Three Caballeros. While Mexico was not a featured country in Saludos Amigos, The Three Caballeros, made extensive use of the country and Walt Disney personally asked Manuel Esper√≥n to collaborate on the Mexican portions of the film. The title song of the film used the same melody as Esper√≥n's song \\"Ay, Jalisco, no te rajes!\\", with new English lyrics written for it by Ray Gilbert. While these English lyrics were not a translation of Ernesto Cort√°zar's Spanish lyrics nor were they similar to them in any way, the chorus of \\"Ay, Jalisco, no te rajes!\\" is sung in its original language. Covers of The Three Caballeros On the official soundtrack of \\"The Three Caballeros\\", the song was sung by Ray Gilbert with Charles Wolcott and his Orchestra. Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters recorded a version of \\"The Three Caballeros\\" which reached #8 in the 1945 charts. Fictional music group Alvin and the Chipmunks covered the title song, \\"The Three Caballeros,\\" for their 1995 Disney-themed album When You Wish Upon a Chipmunk; however, The Walt Disney Company neither sponsored nor endorsed the album the song was featured on. Other notable artists to record this version of the song include Edmundo Ros, The Fleetwoods, Santo & Johnny, Roland Shaw, and Vic Schoen.

He played college basketball for the San Diego State Aztecs. He led the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in scoring in 1986, when he was named the WAC Player of the Year. Watson was named twice to both the All-WAC first team as well the All-WAC Tournament Team. He finished his Aztec career with the school record for most points scored in a game (54), and left with the second-most career points (1,735) in school history. Watson was drafted by the Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in the fourth round of the 1986 NBA Draft with the 87th overall pick. He did not make the team, but went on to play professionally in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) as well as for Athletes in Action. Early life Watson was born in Chicago to Shirley Watson and Edward Johnson. He developed close relationships with his parents, who never married. Watson grew up for 12 years in Chicago, raised mostly by his grandmother, Oaral May Watson. She became one of the biggest influences in his life. Watson began playing basketball in Chicago, but his best memories of the city were of jumping on trains running from tracks blocks away from his home, and riding on the outside of the train to a swimming pool a few miles away. In the eighth grade, Watson moved to Detroit with his mother and her new husband, a Baptist minister, with whom Watson also developed a good relationship. Watson played basketball at Cooley High School in Detroit. As a senior, he averaged 31 points, 10 rebounds, and 8 assists‚Äîearning all-state honors. Most outside observers anticipated that he would play college basketball nearby at Michigan, joining Cooley teammate Roy Tarpley. However, Watson wanted to play immediately, and instead chose to move west to play at San Diego State University (SDSU). College career As a freshman with the Aztecs, Watson made his first start in the ninth game of the season, scoring 26 points in an 89‚Äì85 win over Florida State. Aztecs coach Smokey Gaines made the switch after not getting enough production from the team's senior guards. Watson started the final 20 games of the season while averaging 11.4 points. At the beginning of his sophomore year in September 1983, Watson was declared academically ineligible. While his grade point average was sufficient, he was ruled to lack \\"quality points\\"‚Äîused to determine whether a student is on schedule to graduate with their class‚Äîin his coursework, despite the semester of summer school he recently finished. Not allowed to take classes at SDSU, he enrolled in accelerated classes at San Diego Mesa College. Since he was no longer on scholarship, he worked at a gas station to pay for school. Busy with study and work, he had no time to play basketball. In December, he regained his eligibility, but already missed the first five games of the season. Impacted by his inactivity, he did not re-enter the starting lineup until mid- January. He shot just 39 percent while averaging 10.5 points that season, and later regretted not having redshirted. The following season in 1984‚Äì85, Watson was an All-WAC first team selection after leading the team in scoring with a 17.5 average. He was twice named the WAC player of the week, and also was honored as Sports Illustrateds national player of the week. The Aztecs were 11‚Äì5 in the conference and won the WAC Tournament, where Watson was named to the All-WAC Tournament Team. SDSU's season record of 23‚Äì8 was at the time their best record ever as a Division I team. They qualified for the 1985 NCAA Tournament, their first invite in nine years. In their first-round loss to the UNLV Runnin' Rebels, Watson scored 19 points and had six assists.Wong, May 2010, p.182 Before the start of his senior season, Watson ran into teammate Creon Dorsey during practice and suffered a split in the webbing between the middle and index fingers of his right hand. The injury needed 10 stitches and had to be wrapped heavily with gauze and tape. The Aztecs started the season 0‚Äì7, and Watson was averaging around 17 points through the first five weeks. He was frustrated with his injury and the team's poor start. Furthermore, injuries to two frontcourt players forced the team to move him out of position from guard to small forward, where the Watson faced stronger players standing around . When Steffond Johnson returned to the lineup in mid-January, Watson was able to move back outside. His hand had also healed, and his play improved. He set the Aztecs' school record for most points scored in a game (54) against U.S. International University on February 20, 1986. His 22 free throws that night were also a record. Watson was again named to the All-WAC Tournament team after the Aztecs ended their season with a 78‚Äì75 loss to the UTEP Miners in the conference tournament. He finished the season as the WAC's scoring champion with a 22.5 point average, becoming the first Aztec since Kim Goetz in 1979 to lead the conference in scoring. Watson was named to the All- WAC first team and won the WAC Player of the Year. He also received honorable mention All-American honors from the Associated Press. Watson finished his career at SDSU as the second leading scorer (1,735) in school history behind Michael Cage. He also left with a school record of 702 career field goals. Professional career Watson was drafted in the fourth round of the 1986 NBA Draft by the Denver Nuggets. Though he played mostly shooting guard in college, Watson at only was projected as a point guard. He was cut by the Nuggets in training camp after they acquired another guard, Darrell Walker. He played professionally for one season with the La Crosse Catbirds of the CBA before joining Athletes in Action in 1988.

The film starred Tom Laughlin (who also directed), reprising his role as Billy Jack, and co-starred Rodney Harvey and Delores Taylor. The film was produced from December 1985 to early 1986 in New York City (with some scenes filmed in Central Park), with additional scenes filmed in Toronto. Plot Billy Jack takes on child pornographers in New York City. Production During the course of its filming, Laughlin suffered a head injury when a breakaway bottle malfunctioned while filming a scene in Toronto. By the time he recovered, funds to complete the film were depleted, and production never resumed. Laughlin originally planned to sell the film to a major studio, but plans either fell through or were never realized. At the time production stopped, only approximately an hour of the motion picture was filmed. In addition, while filming took place in New York City, Laughlin broke up a street fight on Manhattan's West Side, and made a citizen's arrest of a man following an argument over Laughlin's driving. Although sought after by Billy Jack fans, nothing from this movie has ever been released to home video. Two scenes have appeared from this movie on Billyjack.com: one shows a thug with a gun to Jean's head; and another scene shows Billy Jack disguised as a priest to infiltrate the Godfather of Godfathers' mansion. Aftermath Since at least 1996, Laughlin had sought funding to resume production on the fifth Billy Jack picture, initially as The Return of Billy Jack, but later retitled Billy Jack's Crusade to End the War in Iraq and Restore America to Its Moral Purpose; then in succession to Billy Jack's Moral Revolution, Billy Jack for President, and Billy Jack and Jean. According to Laughlin, he intended the picture to be a \\"new genre of film\\", with a focus on social commentary of politics, religion, and psychology, culminating in a debate between Billy Jack and then-President George W. Bush via computer manipulation of archived speeches. In 2009, Laughlin released scenes and plot details of that film on a video on his website. At one point, Laughlin also had unrealized plans to make a Billy Jack television series. Laughlin died on December 12, 2013.

His new album \\"Dehors c'est l'Am√©rique\\" (Outside, it's America) coproduced with Rob Stroup at 8ball studio in Portland (Oregon) was released on March 23, 2012. Eric John Kaiser and his full band did a sold out CD Release show at Jimmy Mak's in Portland that same day. After that he went on tour in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, California and Vancouver BC to celebrate its release. To talk about the release of his new album, Eric John Kaiser was also interviewed on KINK radio and performed with his full and in Pioneer Courthouse Square in downtown Portland on August 14, 2012. In November 2012, to celebrate his marriage, Eric John Kaiser released a new four-song acoustic EP called 1+1=Freedom, a collection of love songs recorded as a duo with his wife Patti Kaiser. 2013 was a touring year for Eric John Kaiser, supporting his recent releases. He played on the East Coast (in Boston, Providence and New England), Canada (Quebec and Montreal) and in Montana, Colorado, Idaho and Eastern Washington and Oregon. He also played with his band in support of the Stereophonics in Portland and Seattle. In June he played in Paris at the Sentier des Halles accompanied by his wife Patti Kaiser on keyboard. Dec 7, 2013, he released a new solo five-song CD: Le Pari. 50% of the proceeds of the sales of this record will go towards the non profit Pear Mentor (who builds positive relationships with homeless and transitional youth through music). In May 2014, Kaiser went to isolate himself in a 100-year-old hotel (the Riverside Inn) in Lava Hot Springs, Idaho, and wrote songs for his new album. Back in Portland in the summer, he recorded those songs with his band at Dead Aunt Thelma's studio and New North Sound. This new album Idaho was released on October 25, 2014. In the fall, he toured the West Coast of the USA and France to celebrate its release. Photographer and film maker Kenton Waltz did a video of Eric John Kaiser's first single \\"Idaho\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsNPp3-eipE In 2015, Eric John Kaiser received a grant from the \\"Centre de la Francophonie des Am√©riques\\" in Qu√©bec to go and participate in June to the \\"Village en Chansons\\" festival in Petite- Vall√©e in a region of Qu√©bec called the Gasp√© Peninsula and also to the \\"Franco-f√™tes\\" festival in Moncton, NB in October. A year later he returned to the Gasp√© Peninsula to record his 5th album \\"Made in Gasp√©sie\\" with local French speaking musicians. This new album was released Sept 24th, 2017 and reached #14 at the Billboard_(magazine) World Chart in the USA and Canada.

It was built between 1674 and 1680, on the site of a medieval castle that had been burned down by the French in 1673. The gardens still contain historic elements such as a conservatory dating from the 1890s. In 1918, the former German Kaiser Wilhelm II signed his abdication here and stayed till 1920, when he moved to Huis Doorn. History The current building was designed by the architect Maurits Post as a baroque palace for the owners Godard Adriaan van Reede and his wife Margaretha Turnor. In the main hall a central staircase with painted ceiling was built by Willem van Nimwegen.Rijksmonument report Other ornaments were added in the early 20th century by P.J.H. Cuypers. The gardens contain historical elements and the walls predate 1673. Near the entrance bridge dating from 1678 is a wooden clock tower from 1728 that contains the original clock of the same date. In the north-east corner of the gardens is an orangerie dating from the 1880s, and the north wall was raised during the period when Wilhelm II was residing there 1918-1920. He abdicated in Amerongen then moved to Huis Doorn. Video installation Interior view of the laundry room in the basement, before preservation. From 2002-2011 the castle was restored as a partnership between the Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed and various funds in the cultural heritage sector. To celebrate the completion of the restoration activities, a video installation by Saskia Boddeke and Peter Greenaway was presented to visitors at the castle from July 1, 2011 to June 21, 2012. Through sophisticated video projections visitors are taken back in time to 21 June 1680. In 37 minutes the story is told on 21 different screens throughout the castle. The castle functions today as a museum and is open from 11 to 5 PM from Thursday to Sunday.

Distribution  The slug lives in the Florida Keys in near-shore.  Description  Elysia clarki attains relatively large size (up to 35 mm). Unlike the case for many Elysia species, which are tiny. Elysia clarki is a relatively cryptic species (has cryptic coloration).  Ecology  It inhabits low wave energy habitats, such as mangrove swamps, borrow pits, and mooring canals. It feeds suctorially on several species of siphonaceous green algae including Penicillus capitatus, Penicillus lamourouxii, Halimeda incrassata, Bryopsis plumosa, and Derbesia tenissima. The slug sequesters the chloroplasts from all of these species and uses them for photosynthesis. left|thumb|Digestive tubule cell of Elysia clarki is densely packed with sequestered chloroplasts. C = chloroplast, N = cell nucleus. Photo taken in electron microscope. Scale bar represents 3 ¬µm. Furthermore, Elysia clarki photosynthesizes using the stored chloroplasts for up to three months without ingesting food. This species is one of the so-called \\"solar- powered sea slugs\\". Elysia clarki is an excellent organism for evaluating the relationship between kleptoplasty and feeding behavior, because observations of feeding behavior and measurements of photosynthesis are possible with Elysia clarki. Its photosynthetic capability (because of its kleptoplasty) has been shown to affect its foraging behavior under starvation conditions. 2011 was the first time that this connection was demonstrated for any organism within the animal kingdom.Middlebrooks M.

According to chief economist and director of transportation policy at Infrastructure Management Group, Inc., Porter K. Wheeler, \\"this book makes an important contribution to understanding the infrastructure development process worldwide, with focus on megaprojects.\\" The New Scientist wrote upon publication, \\"Love them or loathe them, megaprojects capture the imagination. [This] damning analysis concentrates on a series of financial nightmares that should bring even the most casual reader out in a sweat.\\"New Scientist, vol. 177, no. 2388 , March 29, 2003. Overview \\"Megaprojects\\" is the term applied to multibillion-dollar infrastructure developments such as massive dams and bridges, and to elaborate railways and highways. The book identifies a \\"megaprojects paradox,\\" pointing out that more of these projects are being implemented, but such projects typically perform very poorly, often with substantial cost overruns and market shortfalls. Chapters two to four examine the Channel Tunnel, which opened in 1994 at a cost of ¬£4.7 billion following cost-overruns of 80% which caused several companies to nearly go bankrupt. Denver International Airport, which cost $5 billion, opened in 1995 following a 200% cost overrun, and passenger traffic in 1995 was only half that expected. There were also problems with Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok Airport, opened in 1998, which had low revenues and negatively affected Hong Kong's economy, initially. According to the authors, the reason for such poor performances is that many of the participants in the process have incentives to underestimate costs, overestimate revenues, undervalue environmental impact, and overvalue economic development effects. The authors argue that central problems are lack of accountability and inappropriate risk sharing, which can be improved by reforming the institutional arrangements of decision making and by instituting accountability at the project development and evaluation stages.  Reception  The Times of London gave Megaprojects and Risk a cover story and wrote, \\"Life is too short to read every tome penned by Scandinavian and German social scientists. But Megaprojects and Risk, written by Bent Flyvbjerg, Nils Bruzelius and Werner Rothengatter, is a cracker. In lurid and startling detail it examines dozens of vast construction schemes around the world.\\"The Times, London, April 16, 2003. The International Journal of Urban and Regional Research wrote, \\"a timely intervention ... Flyvbjerg et al. have presented us with something close to a manifesto that should really be in the hands of every planning minister, regional and city planner, journalist and activist involved in mega-project development ... by the end I was wishing that more social scientists had such a lightness of touch and precise use of illustration. ... highly insightful.\\"International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, vol. 29, no. 1, March 2005. The Geographical Journal wrote, \\"this is the first [book] of its kind. It is concise and clear ... The subject matter is extremely interesting, timely and relevant. It sits within the tradition of ‚ÄòVictims of Groupthink‚Äô and ‚ÄòGreat Planning Disasters‚Äô and attempts to find practical solutions. It is also highly suggestive of wider application beyond its immediate concerns.\\"Geographical Journal, vol. 170, no. 2, 2004. The Financial Express of India found the book, \\"a perfect complement to the richly textured arguments closer to home of Arundhati Roy in her damning indictment of the Narmada Dam and the Sardar Sarovar Project in The Greater Common Good ... The authors [of Megaprojects and Risk] provide a peep-show into social psychology [with] a wealth of empirical evidence ... Do read this book.\\"Financial Express, India, July 13, 2003.

Directed by Doug Raymond and hosted by comedian Jaye P. Morgan, Talk of the Town was primarily a talk-show in which some guests performed short stand-up comedy routines before joining a panel. Other guests simply joined the panel for discussion of their personal lives and careers. Discussion often included sexually oriented jokes, insults and gossip with Morgan and her co-host comedian Pat Cooper. Morgan often emphasized the unscripted and adult nature of the show. In the first of the video episodes she introduces the show as Talk of the Town as \\"The most adult show on television. It's going to shock you, turn you on, turn you off, but it will make you think and see and experience. You will see things on this show that will surprise you, shock you, so kick back, brush away those conservative cobwebs...\\" Roughly three-quarters of the way through each show, a short lingerie fashion show took place with models wearing bathing-suits, underwear or nightgowns provided by Las Vegas design shop Midnight Lace, which at that time was located in the Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas.  Home Video  Talk of the Town was filmed live for cable television and subsequently released by adult video distributor VCX on their in house non-adult video label VCII. Two cassette tapes of Talk of the Town were released by VCII. Show 1 (catalog number VC115) was released in 1983, and Show 2 (catalog number VC127) in 1984. The covers of both VCII VHS releases shared the same cover design as nearly all of VCII's releases. The bottom third of the cover was white with the distributors logo, while the top two thirds displayed artwork from the featured content. In the case of Talk of the Town, both covers had the same art in a different color scheme and with the starring personalities in star shaped frames. Just For the Hell Of It, a rare and out of print video distributor has compiled both of the shows onto a single DVD volume. The DVD cover also reproduces to a large extent the original art used on the VCII VHS cassette covers. Show 1 Comedian Murray Langston performs a routine as his character The Unknown Comic before removing his bag/mask and discussing his current career with Morgan and Cooper. Comedian Rip Taylor performs a short set of his standard routine before joining the guest panel. Actress Linda Blair joins the panel to discuss her career since The Exorcist (film) (1973). After the fashion show interlude adult film actress Samantha Fox comes on to discuss some of the technical aspects of, and her personal experiences working in adult film. Show 2 None of the guests on Show 2 perform stand-up routines, each merely joining the panel to answer questions by Morgan and the other guests. A running theme in Show 2 is comedian Buddy Hackett whom a number of the guests denigrate, insult and compliment alternately. Actor and comedian Redd Foxx was the \\"featured guest\\" in addition to: Actor and comedian Larry Storch Comedian Jack Carter Rusty Warren discusses her role in liberating women's sexual expression through her comedy routines, including specific reference to her 1960 comedy album Knockers Up and its impact on women's liberation.

Dora developed from a tropical wave south of Honduras on July 18\\\\. Moving northwestward in favorable conditions, the system quickly intensified to tropical storm status and attained hurricane intensity the next day. Rapid intensification ensued shortly thereafter, bringing the storm to its peak intensity on July 21 as a Category 4 hurricane, with a minimum barometric pressure of 929 mbar (hPa; 27.43 inHg) and maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 km/h). However, the storm's path into an area with cool sea surface temperatures and wind shear caused Dora to quickly deteriorate and weaken. By July 24, Dora had degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area west of the Baja California Peninsula. Dora brought stormy conditions to the southwestern Mexico coast and the Baja California Peninsula throughout its existence. Remaining off the coast from its formation to dissipation, Dora's effects on land were slight. However, the outer rainbands of the hurricane caused flooding and mudslides in southern Mexico and Guatemala, while rough surf toppled a lighthouse and damaged 60 restaurants along the coast. The hurricane's remnants contributed to heightened shower and thunderstorm activity across New Mexico and Arizona in late July. Meteorological history The origins of Hurricane Dora can be traced back to a tropical wave that emerged off the western African coast on July 7\\\\. The disturbance tracked into the Caribbean Sea seven days later without any signs of development. However, the system encountered an enhanced flow of moisture in the southwestern Caribbean, allowing for organization and the formation of a broad low-pressure area on July 15. Upon tracking into the eastern Pacific, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) judged the storm to have had a low chance developing into a tropical cyclone. The next day, thunderstorm activity erupted around the system, and at 1500 UTC on July 18, the NHC declared the vigorous disturbance to have reached tropical depression status; in post- season analysis, the NHC found that Dora was already a tropical storm by this point after developing six hours earlier. After development, Dora was steered towards the northwest by a ridge over the Southwestern United States. Situated in an area of favorable atmospheric conditions and warm sea surface temperatures, the tropical cyclone quickly strengthened, developing an intermittent eye before being classified as a hurricane at 1800 UTC on July 19\\\\. At the time, the storm was roughly 245 mi (400 km) south-southwest of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Upon reaching hurricane status, Dora began an episode of rapid intensification as its inner structure became more well- defined and its eye more permanent. At the same time, mesovorticies within the eye‚Äîoften indicators of intense tropical cyclones‚Äîwere noted on satellite imagery. By 1800 UTC on July 20, Dora had attained the threshold for major hurricane status. After acquiring some characteristics of an annular hurricane early on July 21, Dora reached its peak intensity at 1200 UTC that day with a minimum barometric pressure of 929 mbar (hPa; 27.43 inHg) and maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), making it a high-end Category 4 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Dora held its peak strength for just six hours before it began to weaken due to cooler waters and the presence of wind shear. Although the hurricane's initial weakening phase was gradual, the overall structure of Dora quickly deteriorated in response to increasingly hostile wind shear around the storm. The storm's eye abruptly dissipated less than 12 hours after Dora's peak intensity, By 1800 UTC on July 22, the tropical cyclone had weakened to tropical storm intensity, undergoing an 80 mph (130 km/h) decrease in winds in just 24 hours. Continued weakening prompted the NHC to downgrade Dora to a tropical depression two days later at 1200 UTC as the system curved west of the Baja California Peninsula. Twelve hours later, the system degenerated into a remnant low pressure area devoid of any thunderstorm activity. The low persisted for a day as it tracked north- northwestward, eventually dissipating 70 mi (110 km) south-southwest of Bah√≠a Asunci√≥n on July 26. Preparations and impact Hurricane and tropical storm- force wind swaths during Dora's existence On July 20, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for a portion of the southwestern Mexico coast from L√°zaro C√°rdenas, Michoac√°n to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco; this watch remained posted until the early hours of July 21. Several hours later, another tropical storm watch was issued for coastal areas of the Baja California Peninsula from Agua Blanca to Buenavista, and was later upgraded to a tropical storm warning as Dora neared the coast. However, the warning was lifted after the hurricane weakened and moved away from land. In Guerrero, the threat of flooding prompted the state government to prepare 900 shelters, while boaters were ordered to exercise caution due to rough seas generated by the nearby tropical cyclone. The outer rainbands of the tropical cyclone caused flooding in the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, and Chiapas, resulting in some damage. Several mudslides in southern Mexico and Guatemala were attributed to these rains. Off the Mexican coast, waves from Dora peaked at 13 ft (4.0 m). These high waves toppled a lighthouse roughly east of Acapulco and also damaged or swept away 60 thatch-roofed restaurants around La Penitas and La Bocana. After passing southwestern Mexico, Dora was expected to track near the Baja California Peninsula, forcing port authorities in Los Cabos Municipality to suspend boat tours and other tourist services. Four elementary schools were converted into emergency shelters in preparation for potential flooding. Residual moisture from Dora enhanced the monsoonal flow over Arizona and New Mexico, producing showers across the region.

Auto Pilen was a diecast line of model cars made in Ibi, Alicante, in southeastern Spain by Pilen S.A.. Models were produced from the 1970s through the mid-1990s mostly in 1:43 scale. A majority of the castings were inherited from French Dinky. The company was started in the 1960s, diecasting items like colorful metal sailboats and key chains. In the late 1980s. Pilen was apparently bought by AHC of the Netherlands. Lineup Pilen made at least 50 different models, in the most convoluted story of diecast seconds and recasts of any successful diecast manufacturer (Colleccion Auto Pilen. No date). Dies were apparently used or copied from a variety of other companies including French Dinky, Corgi Toys, Solido, Mebetoys, Tekno, Politoys (Polistil), and possibly some Mercury models.  European but Spanish  Vehicles in Auto Pilen's lineup were mostly European and included Ferraris, Porsches, Renaults, Citroens, Mercedes- Benz, Volvos and some American cars as well. There was also a line of at least eight Formula One cars in 1/43 scale from the 1960s including BRM, Ferrari, Lola-Climax, Lotus-Climax, Cooper-Maserati, Brabham, and Honda. A few helicopters and airplanes were available. Numbering for the regular 1:43 series began with an \\"M\\" (perhaps reminiscent of Politoys M-Series) and went from 300 to 500. Since this was a Spanish company, FIATs are not shown as FIAT, rather they are SEATs (pronounced 'say-ott'). This was FIAT under license in Spain ‚Äì starting in the 1960s ‚Äì long before Volkswagen took control of SEAT. Thus it is the SEAT 600, the SEAT 850 Spyder, the SEAT 127, etc.  Build quality  For all the complexity of origins of the models, however, the products were uniformly of very high quality. Most were done in a refined and handsome manner, with evenly applied colors (Sinclair 1979, p. 392). The paint application was often in a brighter, almost spectraflame (though that is a Mattel term) appearance (Johnson 1998, p. 15). There were many opening features and hoods, trunks, and doors matched the bodies with satisfying precision. Finished parts were thin and svelte and models appear much like Solido ‚Äì not heavy-handed like some British Dinkys and Corgis. Tyres were rubber and wheels authentically matched each model ‚Äì where a generic one was necessary, a handsome wire wheel was employed similar to those seen on Politoys M Series. Sometimes the chemical reaction in the rubber compound of the wheels could cause melting of the plastic on the base plates of the display cases, but unlike Sablon diecast made in Belgium (which also had Spanish associations) whose plastic wheels all melted with contact with rubber tyres, the problem was avoided on Pilen models by using metal wheels. These models did not appear rushed into production, though some have experienced cracking of faulty zinc alloy conglomerate 15 to 20 years later. Pilen in the mid-1970s was right up with other 1:43 scale companies packaging their models in clear plastic display cases. The screws used to hold models to the orange and yellow plastic bases, however, held them tightly and the tyres often melt and become fused to the plastic of the bases. This is due to a chemical reaction to a softener in the rubber of the tyres. With a bit of coaxing, usually the tyres pull free from the base with no damage. Typical Pilen brochures were thin narrow folded strips 1 3/4 inches wide which normally advertised thirty cars. On the opposite side, the collector was reminded that five of these strips could be collected and remitted to receive a key chain from \\"Escuderia\\" Pilen ‚Äì such diecast trinkets had been traditional Pilen products for some years. Auto Pilen models were the main diecast toys seen in Spanish department stores El Corte Ingles and Galerias Preciados in Spain in the late 1970s. Complex origins The Last Dinky Pilen's model selection appears taken (whether by direct copying from blueprints or through available dies) from a variety of other producers, especially French Dinky Toys. Some tools from Meccano s.a. were transferred from Calais to Pilen in Spain so the models made by Pilen were Dinky castings ‚Äì the base plate of which had been modified from MADE IN FRANCE to MADE IN SPAIN. For example, the Talbot/Simca/Chrysler 1100 saloon, Renault 12 saloon, Mercedes 250 coupe, Ferrari P5, Citro√´n CX Pallas, and Matra-Simca Bagheera were French Dinky castings (Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). Later versions of these cars, though, did not say Dinky anywhere on the base plates. So, from 1974 until 1981, several French Dinky Toys passenger cars were made by Pilen. Bickford says that originally there was an agreement to market the French Dinkys in Spain, but most were sold under the Pilen brand name (Bickford 2009). The French dies were used, but of course the base plates were altered, hiding that fact. These cars were almost exactly similar to the French dies, but with Pilen's own paint finishes. Some were modified and updated by Pilen such as the Citro√´n DS 23 or the Renault 16 and were sold either under the marque Dinky or Pilen with distinct base plates and packaging. It could be said that these were the last genuine Dinky Toys (Dujardin 2014), though Gardiner and O'Neill (1996, pp. 70‚Äì71) show two complete pages of \\"Dinky, Spain\\" without ever mentioning Auto Pilen! Dinkys made in Spain were made available to the French market. The last six Dinky issued in 1980 were Pilen models fitted with a Dinky base plate (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). They were : * 11500 Citro√´n 2cv * 11539 Volkswagen Scirocco * 11540 Renault 14 * 11541 Ford Fiesta * 11542 Simca 1308 GT * 11543 Opel Ascona Corgi, Solido and Politoys The Oldsmobile Toronado, the 1963 Corvette Stingray, the experimental Chevrolet Corvette-like Astro 1 and the Adams Probe all appear to have been recastings of previous British Corgi models. Though Tekno also made a Toronado and Pilen's Toronado had opening doors similar to the Tekno, the general look and opening headlights appear more like the Corgi. Several Pilen models were dead ringers for French Solidos such as the De Tomaso Mangusta which Dinky also made, but Pilen's version was more refined like the Solido, while the Dinky was rather thick and distorted. Pilen's Opel Manta was likely a Solido replica, as well as the Mercedes-Benz C111 rotary concept. Pilen had a Porsche Carrera 6 race car like Corgi and Solido, but the details of the Pilen model match the Solido. A couple other models appear to be copies of previous Politoys models of Italy: the Ferrari Modulo Pininfarina and the Lancia Stratos Bertone. The American Ford GT Mark II is very similar to the Mebetoys (also of Italy) version, and the SEAT (FIAT) 850 Spyder is like the earlier Mercury, another Italian model producer. The company's Chevrolet Corvair Monza open cockpit concept is a doppelganger of the Danish Tekno issue. It seems either Pilen had direct access to dies of many toy makers (which does not seem very likely), or it had superior skills in creating new castings closely matching various existing vehicles ‚Äì perhaps with the help of blueprints. Other Contributions A few models have mysterious origins. The AMC Javelin doesn't seem to have a counterpart elsewhere and neither does the Intermeccanica Indra or the Monteverdi Hai 450, though models of all of these appeared afterward made by different manufacturers. One possibility is that these were new French Dinky castings that had not appeared elsewhere and were to be introduced when the 'Spanish Dinky' line was to premier. Considering the care and quality seen in many of the Auto Pilen models, it is also possible that a few models were done in- house. Auto Pilen also made a line of Matchbox-sized 1/64 scale cars, but these are more rare. Besides a SEAT 131 Wagon, a SEAT Ritmo, a Renault 4F (Van), a Peugeot 504, and a Range Rover ‚Äì among others ‚Äì were made but little is known about them. The Range Rover casting was shared with Guiloy which brings us to the subject of Pilen's connections to other Spanish diecasters (Willoughby no date). Company interconnections Pilen maintained a close association with other Spanish toy makers also headquartered in Alicante like Joal, Guiloy, Guisval, and Mira as seen with a similar casting of the Pilen Adams Probe as a Joal model, and the appearance of a Citro√´n CX which had earlier appeared as a Mira. Pilen's clean Maserati Ghibli, which may have come from an earlier French Norev Jet Car, also appeared as a Guiloy. The Renault 17 sport coupe also looks to be a knockoff of a Norev. Pilen's SEAT 600 was also boxed as a Guisval. The Ferrari 512 S Modulo showcar was a casting from Italian Mercury (History of Mercury 2013). Bickford (2009) also reports that the Javelin, SEAT 124 Coupe and the Monteverdi Hai castings made their way to the Venezuelan company of Juguinsa when Pilen was through with them. Around 1980 there was a Pilen connection with Holland OTO, which had taken over Dutch Efsi Toys. A 1980 Auto Pilen catalog shows many of the revered Efsi vehicles like the Model T series and many Efsi trucks continued as a line Pilen 1980 (Bras 2012). Around 1990, there was also a connection with the Dutch diecast company AHC which appears to have bought Holland Oto and thus Auto Pilen (Bickford 2009). AHC has since shared dies and traditionally Pilen stamped cars can be found in both AHC and Holland OTO labeled boxes (Bickford 2009; Johnson 1998, p. 15). AHC, however, usually produced Volvos, of which Pilen only had a few: the DAF based 66, the 480 Turbo, and the 460 and 850 sedans ‚Äì most of these appear to have been developed first by AHC models before they were reverse marketed ‚Äì and then also later sold as Pilens ‚Äì some of which were made in Spain. Some of these Volvos also appear to have been sold as promotional models. There were also some Nissans made by AHC/Doorkey packaged as Pilens (Bickford 2009). Legacy With the bankruptcy of Doorkey in the early 1990s, Auto Pilen disappeared. The last new models with the Pilen name appeared at this time. In its time, Auto-Pilen was the king of the knock-off and die-cast second. Perusal of the model lineup shows castings were copies or closely copied vehicles from several different companies (Collection Auto Pilen). Models were precisely crafted in a professional and uniform-looking range from leftover castings that had previously been in use elsewhere. Pilen appears to have been the most successful company ever at using second hand castings ‚Äì yet so very nicely reconfigured. References * Bickford, Keith. 2009. Entry on 'Auto Pilen'.

The Nadapal belt is an area stretching southward from the border with South Sudan to Lokichogio in Kenya. The village of Nadapal lies on the road between Narus in South Sudan and Lokichogio. The area has been the scene of violent clashes between Toposa and Turkana pastoralists, traditional rivals. It is becoming a vital border crossing as trade between Kenya and South Sudan booms following independence. People A June 2009 assessment of Nadapal by the UNHCR said 90% of the people in Nadapal were Toposa. The assessment correctly placed the village in the Narus payam of Eastern Equatoria State, Kenya. The mistake may be because the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) had a presence in the village, and the Toposa people mostly live north of the border. The village chief estimated the population was 3,500 including 300 returnees from the nearby Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya. Most of the people were IDPs from Jongole State. The majority of people were pastoralist. Economy The Nadapal belt includes valuable pasture and water points, and has always been an area of conflict between Turkana and Toposa herders. In normal times the Nadapal wetlands provide abundant pasturage and water for the herds of cattle, sheep and goats. The 2009 assessment found that available food included sorghum, maize, meat, sugar, oil, salt and rice, cooked using firewood collected by the women. Insufficient rain was causing food insecurity. The river was not running even in the rainy season. The village had three functioning boreholes providing fair quality potable water, which the women collected. Some families had latrines while others used the bushes. The nearest health services were in Narus, more than 3 hours away by foot, and Lokichogio, more than four hours away by foot. By 2007, the village had one primary school with 428 pupils taught outdoors under trees by 11 teachers. The nearest secondary school was in Narus town, away. School supplies were being provided by the Government of South Sudan's State Ministry of Education and UNICEF. Oxfam and the local organization Turkana Education For All helped improve facilities, and by 2009, enrollment at the primary school had increased to 1,425. Civil war Toposa woman ‚Äì armored vehicle in background. After the outbreak of the Second Sudanese Civil War in Sudan in 1983, the United Nations sponsored an operation called Lifeline Sudan for emergency relief, based in Lokichogio. Soldiers of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) moved into the area to escort relief convoys. During the civil war many people from South Sudan took refuge in Kenya from the Sudanese Armed Forces. With the end of the conflict, some Kenyans wanted the Toposa of the Nadapal area to return to South Sudan. The Toposa may have been reluctant in part because of the economic importance of the green Nadapal belt, but also in part because they felt that dominant tribes in South Sudan such as the Dinka and Nuer thought the Toposa had backed the Government of Sudan during the civil war, and they would therefore be treated as an unwelcome minority in Eastern Equatoria. Post-civil war conflict The SPLA troops did not immediately leave after the end of the civil war in January 2005. On 30 July 2009 two Kenyan cabinet members visiting the area were stopped by SPLA troops. The Kenyan government asked the SPLA to leave the country, but otherwise took a restrained position. In October 2009 it was reported that some Toposa people attacked the newly established barracks in Nadapal and killed 16 Kenyan troops. Kenya denied that the incident had occurred. A second attack occurred a week later. With growing tension, some of the Toposa moved north to Kapoeta to live with relatives. Kenyan police were providing armed escorts for civilian vehicles travelling from Lokichokio to Nadapal, and the SPLA was providing armed escorts from Nadapal to Kapoeta. There were ongoing clashes between the Toposa and Turkana. In February 2010 there were two serious incidents. Turkana raiders attacked Toposa cattle camps near Nadapal, with six Toposa and two Turkana raiders being killed. Ten days later, Toposa youth ambushed a vehicle between Nadapal and Lokichoggio killing two Kenyans and wounding an unknown number. According to an SPLA spokesman, Khartoum's Alintibaha newspaper deliberately misquoted Reuters and said the Kenyan Defence Ministry had accused the SPLA of the second ambush. Following the second incident, the Standard reported that \\"Kenya and Southern Sudan security forces are conducting a joint security operation to crack down on suspected Toposa militia along the border\\". A May 2010 report said the fighting between Toposa and Turkana had claimed over 40 lives and about 4,000 livestock had been stolen. It also said that George Echom, Deputy Governor of Eastern Equatorial State, had claimed that Nadapal belonged to South Sudan. Commerce Turkana people In February 2008 the South Sudanese government awarded a contract to upgrade the road between Nadapal and Juba from gravel to international trunk road bitumen standard. The start of work was delayed due to security problems and the need to remove mines laid during the civil war. The road had assumed a vital role in supply of goods and services to Southern Sudan, forming part of the \\"Northern Corridor\\" linking the port of Mombasa through Kenya to Southern Sudan. In July 2008 the border crossing was closed after Kenyan police prevented truckers from bringing arms into their country. A dispute flared up, with troops from both sides arriving, and the border remained closed for two days as the dispute was sorted out. About 80 trucks from South Sudan were held up during the closure. The South Sudan government established an Immigration office at Nadapal to promote trade and boost security, and built 51 housing units for South Sudan Immigration Office, Public Health, Police and other government workers. The facilities were opened early in July 2011. That month, the South Sudan government imposed a ban on entry of Somali people to the country, forcing hundreds of traders and truck drivers to camp at the Nadapal border. After a two-week delay the government relaxed the rule, saying that Somalis of Kenyan origin could enter as long as they produced their national identity cards or passports. For security reasons, non-Kenyan Somalis were still rigidly excluded. This came at a time when growing numbers of Kenyans were seeking business opportunities in the newly independent South Sudan, making the border crossing increasingly busy.

It was the last resolution adopted by the Security Council in 2006. The text was sponsored by France and Greece. The passage of Resolution 1738 was welcomed by media freedom groups such as Reporters Without Borders. Resolution Observations In the preamble of the resolution, the Security Council reaffirmed its responsibility in the maintenance of international peace and security under the United Nations Charter, while further reaffirming that parties to armed conflict were responsible in taking steps to protect civilians. In this context, it recalled the Geneva Conventions and Protocols I and II, with particular attention to references concerning the protection of journalists. There were also existing prohibitions in international law against the deliberate targeting of civilians in armed conflict and Council members called for those responsible for attacks to be brought to justice. The resolution reaffirmed the need for a broad strategy of conflict prevention which addressed the causes of the conflict in order to protect civilians. It expressed concern at acts of violence against journalists, media professionals and associated personnel, in violation of international humanitarian law. Furthermore, the Council recognised that the issue of protecting journalists in armed conflict was \\"urgent and important\\". Acts Resolution 1738 condemned attacks on journalists, media and associated personnel, calling for an end to such practices. It stated that these personnel were to be considered as civilians and had to be protected and respected. Additionally, equipment and installations used by the media were also considered to constitute civilian objects and thus were not to be the target of any military action. The Council also deplored incitement to violence in the media, further stating that it would take further action against media broadcasts inciting genocide, crimes against humanity and violations of international humanitarian law. All parties involved in conflict had to comply fully with their obligations concerning the protection of civilians in armed conflict, including media personnel. Council members regarded the deliberate targeting of civilians and other protected persons in conflict as a threat to international peace and security and expressed an intention to consider further action if necessary. States that had not become party to the Additional Protocols of the Geneva Conventions were invited to do so.

A tintinnabulum often took the form of a bronze ithyphallic figure or of a fascinum, a magico- religious phallus thought to ward off the evil eye and bring good fortune and prosperity. A tintinnabulum was a sort of a mobile with bells attached, and acted as a door amulets. These were hung near thresholds at a shop or house, under the peristyles (around the inner courtyard or garden) by the bedroom, or the venereum, where the wind would cause them to tinkle. Or else they were made to ring like doorbells, a series of them being tied to cord attached to a bell pull. The sounds of bells were believed to keep away evil spirits; compare the apotropaic role of the bell in the \\"bell, book, and candle\\" ritual of the earlier Catholic Church. It has also been surmised that oscilla hung on hooks along colonnaded porticoes may have comparable evil-warding intents.

The \\"gun\\" is a gland with a duct on the front of the head. It operates by a chemical reaction triggered when the termite contracts its mandibular muscles. The termite is \\"able to eject the frontal gland material over a distance of many centimeters\\". The gland material is forced out through the front of the internal nose and its pores, which covers much of the termite's head. Termites have been shown to be extremely accurate with the gun, even though they are blind. The exact nature of how termites retain such accuracy and are able to orient themselves toward their enemy is currently unknown, but it is believed that the ability is \\"olfactory or auditory\\" in nature. In some subspecies, when the glandular secretion is fired, it rips off the termite's mandibles, forcing them to retreat back into the nest. However, some species have evolved as such that their mandibles in and of themselves offer little protection or defense, so the loss of them does not hinder the termites. It is also possible for the termites to fire their gun more than once, if the threat that caused them initially to fire continues to exist. The fired material is glue-like and sticks to objects that it hits, causing the legs of an attacking enemy to become stuck to the ground. Most often, though, a number of termite soldiers will fire upon the enemy and the combined force of the \\"bullets\\" will kill the enemy along with covering it in the glue-like substance. It has also been observed that, for those that survive the force of the material, it also causes varying negative effects, likely because of the terpenes contained in the compound. Eventually, if not killed from other effects, the secretion of the termite will kill any enemy insects after 24‚Äì48 hours. In comparison, the effect of the secretion on termites of the same species was considerably worse, with the secretion causing death within 5‚Äì6 hours. Chemical composition The secretion from Tenuirostritemes tenuirostris consists of a mixture of three terpenes, namely 62% pinene, 27% myrcene and 11% limonene. These form a resinous glue resembling pine resin. The secretion contains an alarm pheromone that alerts other soldier termites of an enemy attack and causes them to fire their fontanellar gun. It was discovered that the pinene was also acting as an alarm pheromone while it was forming the composition of the terpenes. Because later arriving termites did not also fire their gun, it is believed that the pinene pheromone lasts for only a brief period of time before dissipating. In Cubitermes and Crenetermes, the frontal gland secretes a mixture of terpenes, including unusual diterpenes, which is species- specific.

Lamar is a Carnegie Doctoral Research University, one of only 27 so designated universities in the United States. Founding and Establishment The idea for a public junior college in Beaumont's South Park was formed by Louis R. Pietzsch. Pietzsch had become intensely interested in the junior college movement while enrolled in summer school at the University of Chicago in 1918, and by 1921, was convinced that South Park should have a junior college. Lamar University started on September 17, 1923 as South Park Junior College, operating on the unused third floor of the new South Park High School, with Pietzsch acting as the first president of the college. Approximately 125 students enrolled in 1923 and were taught by 14 teachers.http://sherrysharp.com/southpark/history/LU-origin.jpg Eight students who had transfer credits graduated in 1924. The city of Beaumont offered Pietzsch the position of city manager in 1924. Carl W. Bingman the Dean of South Park Junior College and Principal of South Park High School became the President of South Park Junior College. Carl W. Bingman was known as \\"The Skipper\\" to all who knew him.http://sherrysharp.com/southpark/history/sporigin.htm In the fall of 1924 South Park Junior College had an enrollment of 200 students, and the school boasted an athletic department of football, basketball and track for men and basketball for women. South Park Junior College became the first college in Texas to receive Texas Department of Education approval during the first year of operation, and became fully accredited in 1925. In 1927, commencement speaker, Dr. Frederick Eby, dean of the School of Education at the University of Texas, described South Park College as first among the junior colleges of Texas. By 1928 the school claimed to be the largest junior college in the state of Texas with an enrollment of 280 students.http://sherrysharp.com/southpark/history/LU-origin.jpg Men's tennis and golf were added to the athletics in 1929. Some of the early clubs at South Park Junior College included: Curtain Club, Pallas Athena Literary Society, and the Patrick Henry debating society. Men's clubs like the Lion's Tamers' and women's clubs like the Famished 13 were added as early as 1924. By 1929, two more men's clubs and another women's club were founded, the Kollege Club and Sons of the Sahara for men and the Rounders for women. Lamar College In 1932, recognizing that the junior college was now serving the region, the college held a public contest to rename itself and would award a $100 scholarship to the winner. Otho Plummer a recent graduate was one of 25 to suggest the name Lamar College, after Mirabeau B. Lamar, but he won by virtue of the 100-word essay he wrote in support of the idea. On August 20, 1932 the board voted to change South Park Junior College into Lamar College. In honor of this change head coach and athletic director John E. Gray dropped the old athletic nickname \\"Brahmas\\" in favor of \\"Cardinals.\\" By 1932, no faculty member was scheduled to teach in both the college and high school. The next year, 1933, the separation of the college from South Park High School began with construction of new facilities. These changes occurred during the troubled days of the Great Depression, a time when many institutions faltered, but Lamar continued to grow. College authorities did what they could to help students during this difficult period. In 1938, about half of the students were employed by the college at wages that enabled them to earn all or part of their tuition, fees and textbooks.http://72.18.160.32/newsevents/articles/221_1122.htm In 1938, realizing that Lamar College's continued growth would place significant burden on the rest of the South Park School District an enlarged union junior college district was proposed. A committee of the Young Men's Business League, working closely with officials of Lamar College and the school board of South Park, spearheaded the task of creating a union junior college district. Early plans called for a district comprising the Beaumont, South Park, French, Nederland and Port Neches school districts, but opposition in the latter two districts caused them to be dropped. In an election Sept. 21, 1940, voters approved the creation of a Lamar Union Junior College District, the issuance of bonds to construct an entirely new college facility, a new tax for support and maintenance and the election of trustees to govern the college. A previous decision, in 1938, by the South Park board of trustees to buy a 58-acre tract of land on Port Arthur Highway, just three blocks east of what was then the Lamar campus, predestined the location of Lamar's Campus. The tract was most unattractive, having been used as a tank farm for oil storage, but the Texaco Company was willing to sell it for $18,000. One of the first actions of the Lamar Union Junior College District board of trustees was to purchase this land from the South Park board for cost and fees. In the 21 months between the election of September 1940 and June 8, the day classes would begin at the new campus, significant changes were undertaken. The newly elected board of trustees secured agreement from the old board to continue operation of the school until June 2, 1941. On that day, although the college still inhabited its original buildings, the new board would take control of operations of Lamar College. Other than the shared facilities, the cord tying Lamar College to the South Park School District had been cut. On June 1, 1942 as the college was moving into its new facilities John E. Gray became president of the college. By 1942, the college was completely independent of the South Park school district, and operations moved to the current campus. Lamar State College of Technology With the end of World War II, an influx of veterans boosted enrollment, and the Lamar board of trustees asked the Texas Legislature to promote Lamar College to a four-year state college. The initial attempt in 1947, led by Texas Representative Jack Brooks failed, but the following year the bill passed both houses. On June 14, 1949, Governor Beauford Jester signed the bill creating Lamar State College of Technology with the new entity to focus on engineering and science, an emphasis that continues today. Present at the bills signing were State Rep. Jack Brooks the bill's author; State Sen W.R. Cousins Jr. - Beaumont; Lt. Governor Allan Shivers - Port Arthur; State Rep. Miller B. Walker - Beaumont, and State Rep. Otis Lee - Port Arthur co-authors.Beaumont Enterprise June 15th 1949 \\"Jester Signs Lamar Bill Into Law\\" Lamar was the first junior college in Texas to become a four-year institution. Jack Brooks, Texas legislator responsible for Lamar becoming a 4-year institution Desegregation  Desegregation - 1950s and 1960s   Efforts to Gain Admission  African American veterans of World War II who returned to Southeast Texas found they had no opportunities for postsecondary education or vocational training and chafed over Lamar becoming state supported while it still barred their admission solely on the grounds of race. A group of black leaders calling themselves the Negro Goodwill Council protested to Governor Beauford Jester about the dismal educational inequality in the city and the exclusion of blacks from Lamar State College. They attempted to block passage of the bill to change Lamar into a state-supported senior college, which resulted in John Gray, Lamar's president, creating a black branch of Lamar called Jefferson Junior College. It opened with evening classes at Charlton-Pollard High School. In 1952, James Briscoe, a native Beaumonter and graduate of Charlton-Pollard High School, applied to Lamar. Briscoe's parents were laborers and members of the Beaumont chapter of the NAACP. They courageously supported their son's effort to prove that qualified blacks desired more than junior college offerings and wanted to study in Lamar's new four-year degree programs and avoid the inconvenience of going long distances away from home for a BA degree. Briscoe, a student at Morehouse College in Atlanta since 1950, at the urging of his parents and the Beaumont NAACP, applied to Lamar and was accepted. The admissions office notified him that on the basis of his transcript, he was qualified to enroll for the spring term of 1951. On January 29, when Briscoe went to Lamar with his acceptance letter in hand to register for classes, Lamar's acting president G. A. Wimberly met with Briscoe and explained that a mistake had been made and suggested he apply to TSUN, now named Texas Southern University. State law, he said, created Lamar for whites only. In the summer of 1955, Versie Jackson and Henry Cooper, Jr., became the lead plaintiffs of a class action lawsuit, Jackson v. McDonald, which sought to end Lamar's policy of racial segregation. Lamar Cecil, the federal judge the case came before, ruled on 30 July 1956, that Lamar's ‚Äúwhite youth‚Äù only admissions policy was unconstitutionality and that September a total of twenty-six blacks were admitted to the college amid violent protests at the campus gates and throughout the region for a number of weeks until Texas Rangers arrived and the rule of law restored.Shabazz, Amilcar; Advancing Democracy: African Americans and the Struggle for Access and Equity in Higher Education in Texas, University of North Carolina Press, 2004, pp. 169-180,  Desegregation of Athletics  In 1962, Anthony Guillory blazed the trail for an integrated athletics department at Lamar. Guillory transferred from Nebraska. Path to university status Enrollment continued to grow throughout the 1950s and 1960s, reaching 10,000 students. Graduate work was authorized in 1960, when master's degrees were offered in several fields.http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kcl02 The enrollment plateaued in the 1970s as the baby boomers generation reached adulthood. In 1969, Lamar State College opened its first branch in Orange, Texas. In 1970, Lamar State College began offering its first doctoral program, the Doctor of Engineering, and in 1971 the college's name was officially changed to Lamar University. In 1975, the university merged with Port Arthur College in Port Arthur, Texas, creating Lamar University-Port Arthur. In 1983, Senator Carl A. Parker sponsored a bill creating the Lamar University System, and in 1986, Lamar University-Orange and Lamar University-Port Arthur were granted accreditation separate from the main campus. Lamar Institute of Technology was created in 1990 to provide technical, business, health and industrial education through programs two years or fewer in length. Recent history In 1995, the Lamar University System was incorporated into the Texas State University System, with the Lamar State College - Orange, Lamar State College - Port Arthur and Lamar Institute of Technology campuses becoming separate entities within the system. In the fall of 1998, the Lamar University faculty numbered 423 and student enrollment was 8,241. Since the reorganization, Lamar University's enrollment has continually increased with enrollment reaching 14,889 students in 2014. Recently numerous construction projects have revitalized or replaced aged buildings and facilities.

The power station was the second major plant constructed for Brisbane, the first being the New Farm Powerhouse. It had an installed capacity of 250 MW. Planning for a new power station started in 1946 as plants at New Farm and Bulimba had reached capacity. Before the Tennyson Power Station was completed demand for power was exceeding capacity. This led to the successful staggering of work hours and some restrictions on electricity use. The land on which the power station was built was acquired by Brisbane City Council in 1947 as an ideal site to generate power for the city, due to its proximity to the Brisbane central business district and both rail and river access from Ipswich. Construction of the power station began in 1949. The power plant was fueled by subbituminous coal, transported via the Brisbane River on barges from Ipswich. After the power station was shut down, demolition was avoided for many years, partially due to the hazardous nature of the asbestos used in construction. The opening scene of the 2002 film Scooby-Doo was filmed here. In 2005, a contract was awarded to the developer Mirvac by the Government of Queensland to develop the site. The power station was demolished and both the Queensland Tennis Centre and Tennyson Reach apartment complex were built in its place.

International Law Training Centrehttp://rsilpak.org/international-law-training-centre-capacity- building/ An integral part of RSIL's core mandate is the development of the capacity of domestic and international policy makers. From its creation, RSIL has sought to educate and train stakeholders on the importance of the part that international law plays within a state's legal framework. As RSIL expanded, it was felt necessary to create a dedicated platform for RSIL's capacity building activities. In June 2016, Mr. Ahmer Bilal Soofi established the International Law Training Centre (ILTC) at RSIL, so as to formalize RSIL's capacity building activities under one roof so to speak. To this end, a large space has also been designated within RSIL's Islamabad Office for the ILTC. The ILTC can comfortably fit 35 participants or training attendees. Conflict Law Centre The Conflict Law Centre at the Research Society of International Law, Pakistanhttp://rsilpak.org/conflict-law-centre-at-rsil/ was established in September 2015 with the aim of studying Pakistan's domestic law applicable to situations of armed hostilities and enhancing the capacity of State actors in relation to the State's international legal obligations under International Humanitarian Law (IHL). Against the backdrop of several internal military operations to counter militancy and terrorism in the country, it was felt that a dedicated research unit was urgently needed to assess the effectiveness of domestic law. This included exploring the Constitutional mandate afforded to the Armed Forces of Pakistan under the rubric of Article 245 in relation to ‚Äòactions in aid of civil power‚Äô, as well as law enforcement powers available under Pakistan's counter-terrorism laws. Training courses/community and youth engagement As mentioned above, one of RSIL's core functions is the dissemination of international law in Pakistan.

She was known for her role in the resurgence of direct stone sculpture,Joan Hess Michel, ‚ÄúElaine Rapp: Stone Carver,‚Äù American Artist, January 1969 and especially for her international stone-carving workshops.Elaine Rapp, ‚ÄúGestalt Art Theory in Groups,‚Äù from Feder and Ronall, Beyond the Hot Seat: Gestalt Approaches to Group (Montclair, New Jersey: Beefeeder Press, 1980), pp. 86-104  Biography  Rapp grew up in the Bronx, married after graduating from high school, and had a daughter, Stephanie. When her daughter was six, Rapp continued her education, and eventually ended up at the Art Students League of New York under the tutelage of sculptors John Hovannes and William Zorach. While studying sculpture, Rapp also began a lifelong interest in humanistic psychology, and after a successful one-woman gallery exhibit, she would devote most of her career to combining the two disciplines.Nancy Amendt-Lyon, ‚ÄúArt and Creativity in Gestalt Therapy,‚Äù Gestalt Review, 2001 The exhibit, held in January 1967 at New York‚Äôs Bodley Gallery, featured twenty-six of Rapp‚Äôs sculptures, in marble, limestone, alabaster, and other stones, all of them hand-carved with hammer and chisel.Bodley Gallery brochure, Elaine Rapp: Stone Sculpture, January 4 through 24, 1967 All but eight pieces were sold to private collectors and museums, including a bust purchased by the Evansville Museum of Art in Indiana. Three years later, Rapp launched her stone-carving workshops, first in her Manhattan loft, and subsequently in Mexico, Canada, and England. In 1971, she began teaching at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, became a registered art therapist in 1975, and was later on board certified. She also became a full member of the New York Institute for Gestalt Therapy, after receiving training from co-founder Laura Perls. Rapp believed that stone sculpture and Gestalt therapy were congruent, because both dealt with ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs emerging.‚Äù This philosophy informed her stone-carving workshops, which were attended by students who in many cases were artistic novices. Contending that ‚ÄúI could teach anybody to carve a stone,‚Äù Rapp once filled a gymnasium at Pratt with over a hundred students, and got each of them to produce a stone sculpture in a matter of hours. Rapp ceased her workshops in the mid-nineties, and retired from Pratt in 2005. Rapp died in Great Neck, New York on April 15, 2019 at the age of 91.

It is located in the ghost town of Canelo, within a small valley between the Canelo Hills on the west and the northern Huachuca Mountains on the east. It was built by the United States Forest Service (USFS) and the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the early-1930s. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 for its American Craftsman and Bungalow style architecture. The listing includes five contributing buildings on a property, designed by USFS architects in Bungalow/Craftsman style. History Construction of the Canelo Ranger Station began in November 1932, before the establishment of the CCC, which was responsible for building and improving many of Arizona's ranger stations and park sites during the Depression era. Work was first started on a new adobe house for the rangers by Forest Service workers. During excavations for the construction of the basement, workers unearthed a redwood coffin containing the remains of local pioneer Captain Joe Parks. Parks had settled in the Canelo area in 1882. After the coffin's removal, concrete was poured to form the basement, which was finished in early December 1932, when work ceased for the winter. On June 16, 1933, it was reported that the construction of the Canelo Ranger Station complex was finished with the completion of a small adobe barn, made from scrap materials salvaged from an older ranger station house. In addition to the residence and barn, a new office building, a three-bay garage and a small pumphouse along nearby Turkey Creek were also constructed, all of adobe brick. The office is identical in plan to the Patagonia and Lowell Ranger Station offices, but instead of a flat adobe roof common to desert settings, it features a wooden gabled roof, meant to fit in with the surrounding woodland environment. Not long after the establishment of the Canelo Ranger Station, the CCC arrived and was put to work building the stone retaining walls around the office and residence, improving the roads, landscaping, and building corrals. National Register of Historic Places listing The station is considered to be a good representation of a USFS administrative complex from the Depression era, and is also significant for its association with the expansion of the USFS from a custodial superintendence role to active resource management, which continues to the present day. The retaining walls are still intact, along with most of the rest of the station, which has changed very little over the years. Although a few additions and other minor modifications have been made, the overall appearance of the station remains very much like it did when it was first built in the 1930s. Contributing buildings The following are the contributing buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places: * Office: Bungalow/Craftsman style adobe building with two entrances, two offices and a bathroom * Residence: Bungalow/Craftsman style adobe building with two bedrooms, a bathroom, living room, kitchen, dining room and basement * Garage: Long adobe building with a wooden gabled roof, one entrance and three bays * Barn: Small adobe building with a wooden gabled roof, next to horse corral * Pumphouse: Small adobe building with a wooden gabled roof, now used for storage See also * Canelo School * Lowell Ranger Station * National Register of Historic Places listings in Santa Cruz County, Arizona Gallery References External links * Category:United States Forest Service ranger stations Category:Coronado National Forest Category:Buildings and structures in Santa Cruz County, Arizona Category:Government buildings in Arizona Category:Government buildings completed in 1933 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Santa Cruz County, Arizona Category:Park buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona Category:1932 establishments in Arizona Category:Civilian Conservation Corps in Arizona Category:American Craftsman architecture in Arizona Category:Bungalow architecture in Arizona ","title":"Canelo Ranger Station"},{"id":"32502955","text":"RNA and tRNA generally has a complex two-dimensional structure. Ruth Nussinov realized that there was a simple way to reveal the structure of RNA and tRNA. The methodology is to create a circle. Each base is numbered. If there are \\"n\\" bases, then the numbers are 1 through n. Each number is represented as a dot on the circle, progressively from 1 through n. For bases that are bonded together (for example, 2 and 48, a line is drawn between 2 and 48. The resulting Nussinov plot will easily reveal secondary structures such as cloverleaf structures in RNA or tRNA (the presence of \\"flowers\\"). If chords drawn intersect, this corresponds to pseudoknots in the tRNA structure. Pseudoknots imply twists in the RNA or tRNA structure (the RNA or tRNA is not really planar). Lines (bonds between flowers, for example) explain 3-dimensional folding (tertiary folding).

A constitution was drafted in May 2011 for BirdLife Australia, which became operational on 1 January 2012. Their respective magazines, the Bird Observer and Wingspan were succeeded by Australian Birdlife. History At simultaneous annual general meetings held on 21 May 2011, the respective members of BOCA and Birds Australia voted to merge and form the new company. Over 93% of those that voted from BOCA voted for the merger and over 95% of those that voted from Birds Australia voted for the merger. A combined total of 4517 Birds Australia and BOCA members voted on the resolution, with over 36% of Birds Australia members and more than 50% of BOCA members voting. This was the biggest response to a proposed resolution that either organisation had ever received. With the merger, BirdLife Australia became the Australian national partner organisation of BirdLife International, a role hitherto performed by Birds Australia. The inaugural Board of Directors was made up of five board members from each of the merging organisations, with the addition of a \\"neutral\\" chair, Gerard Early - who continues to serve as a board member. The inaugural Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Dr Graeme Hamilton, resigned in October 2012. Dr Hamilton had served as CEO of Birds Australia from 2005 to 2011, and also as CEO of BOCA in its final months of operation in 2011. James O'Connor served as interim CEO from October 2012, until the appointment of Paul Sullivan in January 2013. Constitution The constitution of BirdLife Australia is loosely based on the constitutions of the merging bodies. The organisation is member-based, and board members are elected by the membership at an annual general meeting. The constitution also describes a transitional period for the board for its first three years of operation, whereby two members of each original board will stand down at each annual general meeting. Operations BirdLife Australia's current national office is at 60 Leicester Street Carlton, Victoria, at the site of the former Birds Australia office. The office of BOCA was in Nunawading, Victoria, and was still owned by BirdLife Australia. The organisation also leases premises at Sydney Olympic Park in Homebush, New South Wales, and Floreat, West Australia. BirdLife Australia owns and operates Gluepot Reserve, a reserve for bird conservation and research in the South Australian semi-arid mallee region, and leases two bird observatories in West Australia, the Broome Bird Observatory and the Eyre Bird Observatory. BirdLife Australia runs a number of research, monitoring and conservation programs related to Australian birds, and these are often characterised by a significant volunteer input. The Atlas of Australian Birds Project is a national bird monitoring project involving hundreds of skilled bird observers submitting survey data from across the country. This data is used in national reporting, notably State of Australia's Birds reports. Birdata is the gateway to BirdLife Australia data including the Atlas of Australian Birds and Nest record scheme. Datasets from this activity are publicly accessible. Other large scale monitoring and conservation efforts include Shorebirds 2020, a national migratory shorebirds program, and the Beach-nesting Birds program, aimed at improving the conservation status of resident shorebirds through research, adaptive management and community engagement. Other projects, including Birds in Backyards and the Aussie Backyard Bird Count have more of an engagement and education focus. More recently (2017-2019), these projects and programs have been amalgamated into larger programs, including the Urban Bird Program (incorporating the Birds in Backyards program, the Woodland Bird Program (incorporating projects such as Birds on Farms and the Regent Honeyeater Recovery Project), the Coast and Marine Program (incorporating the Beach Nesting Birds program, as well as new programs including the Preventing Extinctions program. These programs are increasingly guided and informed by Conservation Action Planning. Awards The organisation awards a number of regular prizes. The D.L. Serventy Medal may be awarded annually for outstanding published work on birds in the Australasian region. It has been awarded for the last 20 years and is the highest award offered to professional ornithologists by BirdLife Australia. The J.N. Hobbs medal may be awarded annually for outstanding contributions to Australasian ornithology by an amateur ornithologist. The Stuart Leslie Bird Research Award and the Professor Alan Keast Award are bestowed annually to postgraduate students of ornithology, with an emphasis on conservation applications.

From 1973-97, he worked at the Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry, Saint Petersburg, Russia. From 1997-2011 he worked at International North Express, Finland. He specialised in collecting and studying plant genetic resources as initial material for plant breeding. He participated in 15 plant collecting missions, explored different regions of the former USSR (Siberia, Far East, Kazakhstan, Caucasus, Middle Asia, Ukraine) as well as other countries (including Brazil, Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, Algeria, Portugal, Germany, Poland and Finland) to collect a wide diversity of leguminous plants and their wild relatives, used in plant breeding in Finland, Poland, Belarus, Russia, etc. Kurlovich has authored numerous taxa regarding Genus Lupinus L.

LUPINUS Kurlovich has developed Vavilov's doctrines with reference to lupins. Vavilov's ideas regarding the law of homologous series in hereditary variation gives the answer to the question of which material should be sought, while the theory of the centers of origin of cultivated plants responds to the question of where it should be sought.

Plant Genetic Resources Newsletter, ‚Ññ 124, pp. 23-32 With reference to Lupinus, Vavilov considered the Mediterranean region and mountain areas of Mexico, Peru and others American countries as the centers of origin for this genus. Kurlovich, based on the differential systematic-geographical method of plants studies provided for more precise definition of the centers of formation and origin (diversity) of some lupin species.GENETICS OF LUPINS, lupins-bk.blogspot.fi, July 2006; accessed 9 September 2015. According to Kurlovich's data,LUPINS, PREFACE, lupins-bk.blogspot.fi, November 2014; accessed 18 September 2015. the center of formation of wild white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) and the primary center of origin (diversity) of its initial cultivated forms is the Balkans where an exceptionally wide diversity of wild and local forms as well as those that turned wild is concentrated. All three subspecies of white lupin (subsp. graecus Franko et Silva, subsp. termis Ponert., subsp. albus) occur on the Balkans, and it is mainly in this region that wild forms with dotted dark- brown seeds and dark-blue flowers are found (subsp. graecus). Additional confirmation is the Greek name of white lupin: ‚Äúthermos‚Äù (hot). The centers of diversity of cultivated white lupin also include the Apennines and Egypt where cultivated forms of white lupin originated in the ancient times. Moreover, in the ancient Egypt forms with pink-and-blue or light-pink flowers were spread (subsp. termis), and on the Apennines forms with grayish-and-light-blue or white flowers were distributed (subsp. albus.

It is considered the highest recognition for nursing excellence. The program also offers an avenue to disseminate successful nursing practices and strategies. ANCC proclaims that \\"A growing body of research indicates that Magnet hospitals have higher percentages of satisfied RNs, lower RN turnover and vacancy, improved clinical outcomes and improved patient satisfaction.\\" History In December 1990, the American Nurses Association Board of Directors approved the creation of the Magnet Hospital Recognition Program for Excellence in Nursing Services. The program was based on an earlier study by the American Academy of Nursing which identified 14 characteristics of healthcare organizations that excelled in recruitment and retention of registered nurses. Following a pilot program involving five hospitals, in 1994, ANCC awarded the first Magnet recognition to the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle, WA. In 1997, ANCC changed the official name of the program to the Magnet Nursing Services Recognition Program. The following year, the program was expanded by ANCC to include recognition of long term care facilities. By 2000, ANCC had received numerous requests to expand the program outside of the US. The ANCC Board then expanded the program to recognize healthcare organizations abroad. In 2002, ANCC once again changed the official name of the program to its current name, Magnet Recognition Program. Conceptual model The program is based on the 14 characteristics of \\"Magnet\\" facilities originally described in the 1983 AAN study. These characteristics are known as the Forces of Magnetism. These Forces are grouped into 5 Components that represent the framework that distinguishes Magnet organizations.  Transformational Leadership  This component includes the Forces of Quality of Nursing Leadership and Management Style.  Structural Empowerment  This component includes the Forces of Organizational Structure, Personnel Policies and Programs, Community and the Healthcare Organization, Image of Nursing, and Professional Development.  Exemplary Professional Practice  This component includes the Forces of Professional Models of Care, Consultation and Resources, Autonomy, Nurses as Teachers, and Interdisciplinary Relationships.

Early life Frank Sumner was born in South London on 12 October 1902. He joined the Royal Air Force aged 16 as a boy recruit in February 1919. In October 1922 Sumner went to the RAF Armament and Gunnery School at RAF Eastchurch on the Isle of Sheppey for ground and air instruction on the Lewis Gun. After successfully completing the air gunner training successfully he was awarded a brass 'Winged Bullet', worn upon the right sleeve of his RAF tunic. Fighter Command and the Battle of Britain Sumner joined his first unit, No. 64 Squadron RAF, part of RAF Fighter Command, at RAF Church Fenton on 6 September 1939 as a Leading Aircraftsman. He was selected to become an air gunner in the Bristol Blenheim aircraft using the Vickers K machine gun. He flew his first flight as an operational air gunner on 6 December 1939. Sumner and 64 Squadron were detached to RAF Evanton in late 1939 to provide fighter protection to the Home Fleet of the Royal Navy. The squadron returned to RAF Church Fenton in mid-January 1940 and continued on daylight patrols and night sorties. The squadron converted to Spitfires. As a gunner Sumner was now posted to No. 23 Squadron RAF at RAF Wittering on 20 May 1940 to continue air gunner duties in Blenheims, but with a change to night-fighting. He flew operational missions with a variety of pilots during his time on the squadron. Bomber Command In November 1940, Sumner was offered to retrain as a radar operator, but he chose to remain in the trade of air gunner and joined RAF Bomber Command. He undertook training at No. 15 Operational Training Unit (OTU) at RAF Harwell to be a tail gunner in the Wellington bombers using the M1919 Browning machine gun. Sumner was posted to No. 142 Squadron RAF at RAF Binbrook in December 1940 and joined the crew of Wing Commander William Sadler and second pilot (known as '2nd Dickie') Pilot Officer George Bull. The first bombing sortie Sumner took part in was on 3 May 1941 for an attack on Rotterdam in the Netherlands.Wellington W5440 QT-Q Sadler was posted to work at the Air Ministry, so Bull became Captain, and the new '2nd Dickie' was Sgt James Pattison, the rest of the crew consisting of Sumner, observer Maurice Jacoby and the two wireless operator/air-gunners Thomas Harrower and John Parkin. The crew took part in raids deep inside Germany to major cities including Bremen, Cologne, Duisburg, D√ºsseldorf, Hamburg, Rostock, Stettin, Vegesack and Berlin. After these raids and on European ports and harbours, including Antwerp, Brest and Lorient, Sumner was close to completing his 30 'ops'. Whilst he was in Bristol working with the contractor improving the gun turrets, Sumner's crew took part on a raid on Hamburg and did not return and were listed as missing, later killed in action. Final mission 142 Squadron moved to RAF Grimsby in November 1941 and Sumner joined a new crew consisting entirely of non-commissioned airmen. The crew, consisting of Sgt Alexander Gilmour (Captain), Sgt John Lucking (2nd Pilot), Sgt William Lewis (Observer), Sgt John Saunders (W/Op A/G), Sgt Jesse Butterworth (Front A/G) and Flt/Sgt Frank Sumner (Tail A/G), flew together on their first raid on 30 November. Two of the squadron's aircraft failed to return from this mission, one of which was Sumner's. The Squadron Order of Battle simply states, \\"This aircraft failed to return. No W/T communication at all\\". Later news came, via the German authorities, that the crew of a Wellington, which had been shot down by German Naval Artillery (coastal flak) near Kiel had been recovered and buried at the local Garrison Cemetery. It was after the war had finished that Sumner and the crew's bodies were exhumed and identified and interred in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery at Kiel.

Built in 1928‚Äì29 by wool merchant Frank Bond, the warehouse is significant for its role in New Mexico's wool industry in the mid-20th century. It was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1980 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. History Albuquerque's central location and convenient access to the AT&SF; Railway made it the hub of the New Mexico wool trade, which flourished as American demand for wool increased rapidly after World War I. The growing prominence of this industry was reflected in the Wool Warehouse, which was completed in 1929. Capable of storing five million pounds of wool and hides, the building also housed the offices of the Bond-McRae wool trading company, the Wool Warehouse Company, and the New Mexico Cooperative Wool Marketing Association. Bond was the president of the former two companies, both of which were taken over by his son in 1936. Beginning in the 1940s, wool production in New Mexico began to decline. This was due to a variety of factors including limited availability of land for grazing and the rapidly growing popularity of synthetic fabrics. Faced with dwindling sales, the Wool Marketing Association shut down in 1959 and the warehouse itself eventually followed suit in 1972. In 1985, the building was remodeled at a cost of $2.5 million to house a theater and restaurant. Since 1994 it has been owned by Youth Development, Inc., a local nonprofit, and has been used sporadically for concerts, dances, and other events. Architecture The Wool Warehouse was designed by Albuquerque architect T. Charles Gaastra, who also designed the Monte Vista School and the Hendren Building, among others. The warehouse is a two-story red brick structure with of total space. The interior of the building shows an Egyptian influence, most notably in the design of the 36 supporting columns.

Zumelle Castle is a castle near the village of Tiago in the municipality of Borgo Valbelluna, province of Belluno, northern-eastern Italy. Nearby the castle is the early medieval church of San Donato, of Lombard origins. History A first fortification here existed perhaps as early as c. 46-47 AD, when the Romans were consolidating their hold in the Valbelluna, conquered in the 1st century BC. The construction sat on a strategical location, commanding the road coming from the plain through the Praderadego, which has been identified as the Via Claudia Augusta Altinatis or, more likely, one of its side branches. During and after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the castle was the major stronghold of the area as it guarded the connections between Feltre and Ceneda. According to a legend, the ruined fortifications were refounded by one Gaiseric (or Genseric), a faithful of queen Amalasuntha. After her assassination, he established here and had two twins (Italian: gemelle), whence the name. During the early Middle Ages the castle was the location of a feudal struggle, started in 737 when the Lombard king Liutprand appointed Valentino, bishop of Ceneda, as lord of Zumelle. This caused a controversy with John, count-bishop of Belluno, who already ruled these lands; the war was ended in 750 after the intervention of the new king Aistulf. In 963 emperor Otto I gave the county of Zumelle to the bishops of Belluno. In 1037 emperor Conrad II assigned it to his baron Abelfred. The latter died with no male heirs, and the castle went to his daughter Adelheit, who married Wilfred of Colfosco. Their daughter Sofia in turn married Guecellone II da Camino, and thenceforth the castle was owned by the Caminesi family. The castle was rebuilt in 1311 by Rizzardo IV da Camino, lord of Treviso, Belluno and Feltre, but after its conquest by the Republic of Venice it lost its importance. In 1501 it was sacked by imperial troops during the War of the League of Cambrai. Restored, it was subsequently owned by the Zorzi and Gritti families and, after the fall of the Venetian Republic, by the Austrian Empire. In 1872 it was acquired by the commune of Mel, which is still the current owner.

In 1945 the line was closed at the border and since 2000 it has been closed completely except for a 3.6 km section. History  The Bavarian Eastern Railway opened the section from Weiden via Wiesau to Mitterteich on 15 August 1864 as part of its north-south line and 15 October 1865 this was followed by the section to the junction at Eger, which at that time was in the Austrian Empire. The line was always single-track and it lost some of its importance on 1 June 1882 when the Bavarian State Railways opened the Marktredwitz-Wiesau connection of the Weiden‚ÄìOberkotzau railway, but trains ran on the line until the First World War. The foundation of Czechoslovakia in 1919/20 led to more formalities at the border, which runs east of Waldsassen, near Schloppenhof (now Slapany). From Waldsassen station, only passenger trains were allowed to operate to and from Cheb. The track in Germany was taken over by the newly established Deutsche Reichsbahn (German Imperial Railways). After the annexation of the Sudetenland by Germany in 1938 the route was served by a fast train from Munich to Carlsbad (now Karlovy Vary). After the end of the Second World War in May 1945, the line was permanently closed to traffic at the border. Rail services between Cheb and Slapany were maintained until 1967. The line in Bavaria continued to be operated for forty years. On 30 May 1986 Deutsche Bundesbahn closed passenger services, which at times had had more than ten pairs of trains per day. Freight operations ended to Waldsassen on 10 October 1994 and to Mitterteich officially on 1 January 2000. The Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt) approved the closure of the Mitterteich‚ÄìWaldsassen section on 1 August 1995 and it took place on 5 November 1995. On 31 January 2000 this was followed by approval for the closure of part of the Wiesau‚ÄìMitterteich section from 3.6 km from Mitterteich and this was completed on 19 March 2000. The remaining 3.6 km section from Wiesau to the siding of GRB Mitterteich (a nuclear waste storage facility) was converted into a siding to Wiesau station on 31 December 2000 and will continue to be used for freight as required by DB Schenker Rail Deutschland.

Likewise the list of charges found applied to Jesus at Sanhedrin 107b originally referred to Gehazi.Journal of Theological Studies 1982 reprinted in Jews and Christians p105 William Horbury - 2006 \\"Secondly, and more fundamentally, Maier contends that Sanh. 43a did not originally refer to Jesus of Nazareth.143 He notes that the tannaitic material is only quoted in this Talmudic context for the sake of halakhic debate on the proclamation prescribed at Mishnah, Sanh. 6.1 the identification of the condemned man as Jesus has nothing to do with that context, and should probably be ascribed, in Maier's view, to post-Talmudic redaction; the list of charges, also found applied to Jesus at Sanh. 107b (where Maier believes it originally referred to Gehazi) cannot have been uncommon in the rabbinic period, and the anecdote at Sanh. 43a will originally have been told of a second-century magician, ben Pandera.\\" Maier's argument that the name Yeshu in the texts is a later interpolationGraham N.

Sanh. 43a did not originally refer to Jesus: that identification was made only in post-Talmudic redaction. Horbury, however, has argued strongly that the sentences \\"on Passover Eve they hanged Jesus\\" and \\"Jesus the Nazarene\\" ...practised sorcery and deceived and led astray Israel\\" may be older than their immediate context (\\"Benediction,\\" 57). \\" depends in part on his general conclusion that Palestinian Jewry was unconcerned with Christianity before Constantine.Horbury \\"First, Maier's general view (14 f., 255-8) that Palestinian Jewry was unconcerned with Christianity before Constantine is inconsistent with the solidarity attested between Jewry in the Land and elsewhere in the Roman Empire (p. 97 above) and with evidence that Christians attracted adverse Jewish attention in Palestine.. \\" Van Voorst (2000) has depicted Maier's position that the Jesus references in the Talmud were added later in the Middle Ages as the other extreme of the more uncritical early view of R.

Van Voorst Jesus outside the New Testament: an introduction to the ancient p108 - 2000 \\"While Herford was somewhat critical of their accuracy, he seems almost never to have met a possible reference to Jesus that he did not like!70 On the other end of the spectrum, Johann Maier in his Jesus von Nazareth in der talmudischen √úberlieferung has concluded that no genuine Tannaitic or Amoraic references are present, even in the Talmuds when first issued, but were added later in the Middle Ages.71 Most scholarly opinion falls between these two extremes.\\"Martin Hengel, Jesuszeugnisse au√üerhalb der Evangelien in Testimony and interpretation: early Christology p156 ed.

She engaged in gymnastics at the age of 7, in 1992, starting as a member of ZTD Hrvatski sokol - Zagreb. During her career she produced notable results at the national and international level. Early life and gymnastics career Aida was a national all-around champion from 1995 to 2003. Her international career began in 1996, when she competed at the Snowflake Gymnastics Cup in New York City, where she placed fifth in the all- around and third on floor, which was a big success back then. Aida's good results continued with forthcoming competitions such as International Tournament \\"Stjepan Bolti≈æar\\" where she won a number of medals from 1997 to 2003. In 1999, she took part in the strong and well-known Austrian International Competition \\"Alpen-Adria Cup\\" in Klagenfurt, where she won third place in the all-around competition reaching a score of 33.500 (Old FIG- Code).http://www.alpenadriacup.com/images/stories/Ergebnisliste/aac04-Ergebnisse- Gesamt-1999.pdf Later on, in 2000, she won a silver medal at the Belgian Cup, held in Malmedy, scoring 35.315. As well as the previous competition in Slovenia, this tournament was only a check for the European Championships, going to be held that year in Paris, France. There, she placed 55th (out of 114 gymnasts) with the result of 31.186 and once again proved to be the best Croatian gymnast at the time.http://www.gymnasticsresults.com/2000/e2000wjun.html#g51 Injuries, recovery and further competitions Later that year, she suffered a back injury and had to withdraw from the \\"Stjepan Bolti≈æar\\" tournament. Not quite recovered, in 2001, Badiƒá became a senior gymnast and a national champion as well. However, at the competition held in Luxembourg at the end of that year, after a great start on the vault, she sustained a knee injury and had to withdraw from the competition again. 2002 was the year of recovery for Aida. Rehabilitation, therapies and various treatments haven't stopped her from being a candidate for the European Championships in Patras, Greece. However, she wasn't fully recovered and her doctor, as well as her coach Bojan ≈†inkovec, advised her to postpone her comeback for a few more months. Despite those injuries, she managed to do her routines on the floor and bars at the National Competition and win bars and get a silver medal on floor. Also, she placed second at the all-around national competition in November 2002. That was her additional motivation to keep training although her knee was heavily bandaged at every competition. Badiƒá placed second on floor at the \\"Stjepan Bolti≈æar\\" Tournament in 2002, right behind her younger teammate Tina Erceg. She continued with training in 2003, won silver on floor and bronze on bars at the Nationals, but was forced to retire at the end of 2004, having finished her 12-year-long career, being a national team member (1997‚Äì2004), with over 100 medals, won nationally and internationally.

It is acclaimed as one of his best works and received praise from Art Spiegelman and Joe Sacco. Paul Gravett listed it in his 1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die. Concept C'√©tait la guerre des tranch√©es was pre-published in A Suivre. The novel is a series of anecdotal stories set in the trenches of World War One. Many are based on stories Tardi remembered from his grandfather, who was a veteran of that war, and books he read about the topic. He said: \\"When I was small, my grandmother used to tell me stories about my grandfather in the First World War. I think the first book I read that wasn‚Äôt a picture book was a war story about an army dog who saved his master. And I still get this recurring nightmare of finding myself standing in front of a Call-Up poster - it‚Äôs a personal anxiety of mine, being caught up in a situation I can‚Äôt control.\\" The stories focus on the daily horrors and injustices soldiers experienced. Tardi had dealt with World War One as a subject before in Adieu Brindavoine, published in Pilote (1972-1973) and Le Fleur au Fusil (1974). It Was the War of the Trenches is a more ambitious work for whom Tardi documented himself thoroughly, asking advice from various historians and based his drawings on numerous photographs from this period. The comic has a clear anti-war theme, reflecting the soldiers who are permanently physically and psychologically scarred and the numerous who died for a seemingly pointless cause, which are portrayed in brutal graphic detail. Translations An English translation was published in RAW and Drawn and Quarterly in the 1990s. In 2010 it was translated in English as It Was the War of the Trenches and published by Fantagraphics. It won two Eisner Awards for Best Reality-Based Work and Best U.S. Edition of International Material. Similar books Tardi published another two-volume graphic novel about World War I named Putain de Guerre (2008, translated as Fuck this War!).

He is mentioned for the first time in 1233, when the family's lands near Treviso were confiscated after his cousin Guecellone V had been identified as the instigator of the assassins of Marino Dandolo. Biaquino was then part of a league formed against the Trevigiani together with Guecellone and his brother Tolberto II, the cities of Conegliano, Ceneda and Vicenza, the bishops of Belluno and Feltre, and the patriarch of Aquileia. In 1239, Treviso went to the Guelph Alberico da Romano thanks to his support, and Biaquino was podest√† of the city from 1241 to 1243. He also took part on the Guelph side at the siege of Ferrara in 1240. At Guecellone's death, Tolberto sided for the Ghibellines of Ezzelino III da Romano, and Biaquino became one of the area's main Guelph leaders, leading the army of Treviso against Padua and defending Feltre and Belluno. Once both emperor Frederick II and Ezzelino had died (1259), Biaquino reconciled with the Ghibellines of his family: the family's lands were divided, and he received the Cadore (whose rights he had obtained from Bertold of Andrechs, patriarch of Aquileia) and some fiefs in the Ceneda county. In 1260-1270, he supported the Guelph party in the internal struggles of the commune of Treviso, opening to the road to power to his son Gherardo, whom he had from his first wife, India di Gherardo da Camposampiero.

On 22 July 2011 Pedersen survived the massacre on the Workers' Youth League summer camp at Ut√∏ya on 22 July 2011. Although leaders of AUF are never anonymous, his role in the aftermath as a representative for the organisation has caused a vast increase in media exposure, particularly in the months following the attacks. Anders Behring Breivik, the perpetrator of the attacks, stated that Pedersen was one of his three primary targets. Early life and education Born in Skien in Telemark, Pedersen has studied towards a bachelor's degree in political science, and studied courses in European and American studies at the University of Oslo. He was also elected as the first openly gay leader of the Workers' Youth League. Political career He has previously served as the leader of AUF in Telemark (2001‚Äì2004) and Oslo (2006‚Äì2008). He was elected deputy leader of AUF from 2006 to 2010. Pedersen has previously served as a board member in the Telemark branch of No to the EU, and has served as a political advisor to AUF on election campaigns and environmental matters. He also served as deputy member of the Oslo city council and between 2007 and 2011. Leader of the Workers' Youth League Eskil Pedersen became the leader of AUF when he was elected t the post on 17 October 2010, narrowly defeating √Ösmund Aukrust for the leadership. Pedersen succeeded Martin Henriksen who was later appointed senior advisor to the Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs Lisbeth Berg-Hansen. Under Pedersens tenure as leader, the organization experienced a sharp upsurge in membership numbers, more than doubling in size from since 2003, and established itself as Norway's by far largest youth organization. He was reelected to a second term as leader in October 2012. In May 2012, he publicly declared his intent to run for parliament by accepting a nomination by his local party chapter of Skien to the Telemark district list at the upcoming 2013 parliamentary election. He would seek the seat of retiring veteran Sigvald Hansen, however according to analysts he would face stiff competition to secure the party nomination. Among his challengers in the primary were health department state-secretary Robin K√•ss and the recently elected mayor of Hjartdal Sven L√∏kslid. He was however quickly endorsed both by the AUF and his local Skien party chapter. It soon became apparent that Pedersen would be a controversial choice, the Labour party chapters from Porsgrunn, Bamble and the eastern Telemark chapters vehemently opposed his nomination. This was partly due to him living and working in Oslo, but also because he was born in Skien, a city which was already represented in the parliament. Pedersen responded by vowing to relocate to Porsgrunn in Telemark should he be elected. On 24 November 2012 he lost the nomination to dark horse candidate Christian Tynning-Bj√∏rn√∏. In March 2014, Pedersen announced his resignation, saying that he would not seek re- election as leader of the AUF.  Political views   Progress Party  Pedersen is an outspoken opponent to the policies of the Progress Party. In May 2011 he pressed criminal charges against member of parliament Christian Tybring-Gjedde based on the a statement the latter made regarding integration in Groruddalen. The charges were dismissed by the police. In 2013 Pedersen compared Progress Party leader Siv Jensen to the evil antagonist Sauron from The Lord of the Rings. The comments were in the run-up to the 2013 parliamentary election, which Pedersen described as a \\"struggle between good and evil\\".  Labor rights  A staunch trade unionist, Pedersen has actively campaigned against legislation aimed at relaxing existing labour laws. He has voiced fierce opposition to the EU Temporary Agency Work Directive. He has called for tougher penalties, including prison time, for employment agencies which were found to exploit their employees, as well as being involved in social dumping. He has called for the Norwegian government to end economical ties to international corporations who violated Norwegian labour laws.  LGBT rights  Pedersen is openly gay since coming out at the age of 18. Since that time, he has been a vocal proponent of LGBT rights, as well as being one of Norway's most high-profile LGBT figures. He frequently appears in the annual Gay Pride through Oslo. When in April 2014, the Ecclesiastical Synod of the Church of Norway decided against the introduction of special liturgy for same-sex marriage, Pedersen called it a \\"shameful stain\\" on the Church. Pedersen, who is still a member, said he himself hopes to one day be legally married in the church. Ut√∏ya massacre On 22 July, the day of the 2011 Norway attacks, Eskil Pedersen was present at the annual AUF summer camp on Ut√∏ya. As leader of the organization he was one of the assailant, Anders Behring Breivik's, stated targets, along with former prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who was there that day but had left the island before the killer arrived. Breivik would later state that he had studied Pedersen's physical appearance and facial attributes to be able to recognize him during the attack. Very soon after the shooting erupted, Pedersen, along with his political aide, sought refuge on the ferry MS Thorbj√∏rn, and along with seven other people decided to make their escape from the island. Pedersen later stated that while being at the H√∏nefoss police headquarters he feared a coup d'etat had taken place, and that he could not trust any member of the police. In an interview with TV2 he stated: \\"I thought the entire country was under attack [‚Ä¶] if we docked anywhere we would be killed.\\" M/S Thorbj√∏rn controversy There has been widespread speculation in forums and independent blogs about the conduct on the ferry, but most professional media outlets have been cautious in their coverage of the events on the MS Thorbj√∏rn. A news website, Nettavisen, published a story raising questions about the conduct a day after the massacre, but received fierce reactions from other members of the press as well as the AUF itself. More recently Adrian Pracon, a survivor and employee of AUF who himself was wounded wrote of his reaction to seeing the ferry leave in a book describing his ordeal. One section describes his disbelief and disappointment of seeing M/S Thorbj√∏rn head away from the island, depriving him of hope of escape. The 22-year-old from Telemark Pracon later underscored that the passage in the book was not intended as criticism of Eskil Pedersen or the crew of M/S Thorbj√∏rn. Another survivor of the massacre, 20-year-old Bj√∏rn Ihler from Oslo said of Pedersen in an interview with the BBC: \\"This was the leader of the group, it was as if the Captain abandoned his ship\\"., but later stated that his quotes were part of a broader context, and that he had described his feelings of being abandoned, more than criticising the actions. Pedersen defended his actions in the same programme, stating: \\"I think I acted normally given the situation. I acted according to instinct. I did what I was told and boarded the boat\\" and countered \\"I have been criticized for my actions, and for my views on the multicultural society by people who support the gunman's views\\". The movements of MS Thorbj√∏rn were subject to investigation as a part of the broader inquiry into the attacks by the official July 22 Commission. In the Gj√∏rv Report, the police received harsh criticism for failing to utilize the ferry early in the rescue effort. The report states that when contacting the police immediately after leaving Ut√∏ya both the captain and other passengers received instructions flee to safety. The controversy flared up again in September 2012 due to comments by Brynjar Meling. Meling is a high-profile lawyer in the case and his office represents a few dozen of the affected, both AUF-members and relatives of the deceased. He claimed some of his clients questioned Pedersen's leadership of the organization but felt unable to communicate this publicly. Furthermore, Meling claimed that his clients felt that Pedersen's actions during the massacre should have consequences for his future career, and that they were frustrated by the AUF leadership's insistence that the organization as a whole was united behind Pedersen. The comments immediately caused a fiery reaction from the AUF as well as the Labour party. Secretary-General of the Labour Party Raymond Johansen responded to Meling saying he felt \\"nauseated and furious\\" at him, other politicians used more profane expressions. Meling responded by accusing the Johansen and the Labour party of attempting to stifle the debate as well as depriving the survivors of the opportunity to ask critical questions. Leaders of rival parties subsequently defended Pedersen, calling the criticism \\"tasteless\\". A former senior member of the Labour party and AUF who lost her younger sister in the massacre, described how she was prevented from raising questions within the party regarding the incident. She claimed that: \\"MS Thorbj√∏rn and Eskil Pedersen were not to be discussed, it was completely taboo\\". She since left the party altogether in protest. Refurbishing of Ut√∏ya In September 2012 a mother who lost her son during the Ut√∏ya massacre, asked Pedersen to resign as AUF leader, citing that the plans for refurbishing Ut√∏ya \\"once more shows that he is not an adequate leader\\". The $10.4m refurbishing plans have been criticized by several leading Norwegian psychiatrists. One survivor of the massacre called the plans \\"Shocking and inhuman\\". In addition, other survivors and relatives have expressed frustration and that they find it difficult that AUF would be resuming its summer-camp and political activity on that site, with one mother who lost her daughter proclaiming: \\"one does not hold a barbecue on a graveyard\\". Pedersen stated that despite some opposition the refurbishing plans had wide support within the AUF. The Leader of the national July 22 victims group said the plans \\"looked good\\". However, on 25 September some 200 survivors and relatives of the deceased signed a petition calling for the plans to be scrapped and for a national memorial to be established on the island. The following day, the local authorities ordered the plans to be halted pending further consultation with the victims and relatives. Personal life Pedersen currently lives and works in Oslo. After resigning from AUF, he became the new Information Director for the agricultural cooperative Nortura. Due to receiving an increased number of threats on SMS, Facebook, phone and in writing, Pedersen currently has a direct Police security alarm. In December 2012, a 40-year-old man was convicted of sending threatening text messages to Eskil Pedersen. He was fined the equivalent of approximately 700 USD, and given a suspended prison sentence. A Christian, Pedersen is a member of the Church of Norway.

He joined the French army in 1800 and became a topographic engineer. He joined the staff of Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na and was wounded at Caldiero in 1805. He served in southern Italy in 1806 and Poland in 1807. He was wounded at Ebelsberg and fought at Aspern-Essling and Wagram in 1809. When Emperor Napoleon ordered Mass√©na to take command of the Army of Portugal, Pelet went with him as his first aide-de-camp. Though Pelet was a relatively low-ranking officer, the marshal relied heavily on his advice during the unsuccessful 1810‚Äì1811 invasion of Portugal. Pelet fought in the French invasion of Russia, including during Marshal Michel Ney's epic retreat at Krasnoi where he was wounded again. Promoted to general officer, he led troops in the 1813 and 1814 campaigns, including a brief stint as acting division commander. He led a regiment of the Old Guard at Waterloo. Placed on the army's inactive list, Pelet nevertheless worked in the military archives while publishing books and articles about the wars. In 1830, he was appointed director of the army staff school. Though nearly killed in an assassination attempt in 1835, he continued to publish military histories. Under the Second French Empire he engaged in diplomacy and politics.

Early career Pelet was born on 15 July 1777 in Toulouse, France and became a student at the College of Science and Arts in his hometown. After graduation he enlisted in the army when he was 22 years old. In 1800, he was first appointed a sergeant in an Haute Garonne battalion and was later assigned to an engineer unit in the Army of Italy. He was promoted to second lieutenant in 1801 and worked as a topographic engineer for the next four years. During this period he went with Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan on a survey of the Tyrol. In 1805, Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na asked him to serve on his staff and he was appointed an aide-de-camp within a month. Napoleonic Wars 1805‚Äì1811 Pelet fought in the Battle of Caldiero on 28‚Äì30 October 1805 where he was hit by a musket ball in the head. He recovered and served on Mass√©na's staff during the 1806 invasion of Naples, after which he was promoted captain. He went with Mass√©na to Poland in 1807 but was not involved in any fighting. He was wounded in the brutal fighting at the Battle of Ebelsberg on 3 May 1809. Because his troops had accomplished little during the campaign, Mass√©na determined to seize the bridge at Ebelsberg. In the ensuing bloodbath, the French lost 1,000 killed, 1,750 wounded and 800 captured. Austrian casualties numbered 1,000 killed, 1,000 wounded and 4,200 captured. About 1,000 wounded soldiers from both sides were incinerated when the town burned. Pelet earned an elevation in rank to major 12 days after Ebelsberg. He fought in the Battle of Aspern-Essling on 21‚Äì22 May 1809. He occupied Windmill Island on 2 July which preceded the Battle of Wagram on 5‚Äì6 July and also fought at the Battle of Znaim on 10‚Äì11 July. After several months of quiet, Napoleon appointed Mass√©na commander of the Army of Portugal in mid-April 1810 and charged him to drive the British army from Portugal. The army included the II Corps, VI Corps and VIII Corps. Massena tried to decline the office, believing that corps commanders Marshal Michel Ney and General Jean-Andoche Junot would be insubordinate. However, the French emperor was insistent. At this time, Pelet became Mass√©na's first aide- de-camp when the previous one, Charles Escorches de Sainte-Croix was promoted to command a brigade of cavalry. Pelet took part in the negotiations that ended the Siege of Almeida after a lucky French hit blew up the main powder magazine. He was present at the Battle of Bussaco on 27 September 1810. On 12 October Sainte-Croix was killed by a British cannonball. Historian Charles Oman believed that after Sainte-Croix's death, Pelet was the only officer who could exert personal influence with Mass√©na. While the Army of Portugal was in retreat on 23 March 1811, Pelet was ordered to return to Paris to report on the campaign and explain why Mass√©na removed Ney from command of VI Corps. On arriving in Paris, Pelet insisted on seeing Emperor Napoleon as his orders from Mass√©na required, despite being discouraged to do so. After waiting patiently for an entire day, he was finally allowed to see Napoleon, who began by venting his anger at Pelet for the failed campaign in Portugal. After calming down a little, the emperor offered up a series of pointed criticisms, which the undaunted Pelet carefully explained, defending both Mass√©na's and his own actions. By the end of the 3-hour interview, Napoleon's attitude changed to a friendlier one. Pelet was invited to return the next day and help Napoleon compose the bulletin that would be released to the public. Pelet recommended to the emperor that the corps commanders be removed. Evidently, this advice was followed because the corps commanders were soon sent home and the Army of Portugal was reorganized into six independent divisions. Napoleon then promoted Pelet to colonel. Another source gave the date of his promotion as 12 October 1812. 1812‚Äì1815 Before the 1812 French invasion of Russia, Jean Gabriel Marchand who served as chief of staff of the right wing, asked Pelet to join his staff. Marchand and Pelet both had participated in the Portugal invasion. Pelet fought at the Battles of Smolensk and Borodino. After Borodino, he was assigned to lead the 48th Line Infantry Regiment in √âtienne Pierre Sylvestre Ricard's division in Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout's III Corps. At the Battle of Krasnoi, Ricard's division and Ney's rear guard found themselves cut off by large Russian forces. The French tried to break through, but in the effort the 48th Line lost 550 out of 650 soldiers while Pelet was shot in the arm, right foot and left leg. In a meeting with Ney, Pelet advised the marshal to cross the frozen Dneiper River. This recommendation was followed and Ney escaped the trap with 900 survivors. Fighting in Plancenoit during the Battle of Waterloo Pelet was promoted general of brigade on 12 April 1813. In that year's campaign, Pelet first served with Marshal Auguste de Marmont's VI Corps and later with Fran√ßois Rouget's 4th Young Guard Division. At the Battle of Dresden on 26‚Äì27 August 1813, Pelet led the 2nd Brigade in Pierre Decouz's 3rd Young Guard Division in the I Young Guard Corps under Marshal Nicolas Oudinot. The brigade consisted of two battalions each of the 9th and 10th Voltiguer Regiments. Pelet's brigade included two battalions each of the 9th, 10th and 12th Voltiguer Regiments at the Battle of Leipzig on 16‚Äì19 October. In that action, Decouz's 2-brigade division numbered 4,731 soldiers. On 25 January 1814 when the French army assembled at Ch√¢lons-sur- Marne, Pelet commanded a brigade in Decouz's 2nd Young Guard Division in Ney's corps. There were 680 soldiers in the 5th Voltiguer Regiment and 633 men in the 6th Voltiguers. After Decouz was killed at the Battle of Brienne on 29 January, Pelet became acting commander of the division. He led the division in the Battle of La Rothi√®re on 1 February, the Battle of Champaubert on 10 February and the Battle of Montmirail on 11 February. He was reassigned to lead a brigade in Louis Friant's Old Guard Division on 14 February. At La Rothi√®re the division counted 1,800 men, while at Champaubert there were 2,840 soldiers present for duty. Philibert Jean-Baptiste Curial was the official commander of the 2nd Young Guard Division during this time. Pelet fought at the battles of Vauchamps and Montereau in February and at Craonne, Laon, Reims and Arcis-sur-Aube in March. After Napoleon's abdication, Pelet received the Order of Saint-Louis from the Bourbon Restoration and was assigned to the Royal Chasseurs. Nevertheless, he rallied to Napoleon during the Hundred Days and became commander of the 2nd Guard Foot Chasseurs, an 1,100-strong unit in Charles Antoine Morand's division. Pelet's guardsmen fought at the Battle of Ligny on 16 June 1815. At the Battle of Waterloo two days later, Pelet's regiment initially was part of the reserve, but he was later ordered to take his 1st Battalion and defend Plancenoit from the Prussians. The Prussians succeeded in driving the Young Guard and the corps of Georges Mouton, Count de Lobau from the village. In this crisis, Pelet with the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Guard Chasseur Regiment and Morand with the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Guard Grenadier Regiment attacked to recapture the village. As these elite troops advanced with leveled bayonets, the Prussian defenders panicked. Historian David Hamilton-Williams explained that the Prussians were accustomed to seeing the Imperial Guard committed in mass and assumed that many thousands of French guardsmen must be following in the wake of the first two battalions. The Old Guard battalions, joined by the survivors of Lobau's command and the Young Guard, swept their enemies out of Plancenoit with 3,000 casualties. Later that evening, the Prussian reconquered the village house by house against desperate resistance. Pelet and 250 guard chasseurs fought their way out of the village with their eagle, fended off Prussian horsemen and escaped. Later career Fieschi's infernal machine Pelet was placed on half pay in inactive status for three years, then he was appointed to the Royal General Staff through the efforts of Marshal Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr. From 1821 to 1830 he was again put in inactive status. During this time he worked in the archives at the D√©p√¥t de la guerre (War Depot). In 1826 he published M√©moires sur la guerre de 1809, en Allemagne. Over the next two years he published 12 articles about the 1813 campaigns. He wrote an article about the campaign in Portugal in 1827. After the Bourbons were overthrown in the July Revolution of 1830, Pelet was promoted to lieutenant general and elected to the French Assembly. He was appointed director of the D√©p√¥t de la guerre and the General Staff School. He took part in the French intervention in the Belgian Revolution in 1832 and later that year assumed command of the 2nd Infantry Division. He preferred to immerse himself in his studies however. In 1835 he began to publish a series of maps for the General Staff. At the same time, he began an 11-volume history of the War of the Spanish Succession which would take 15 years to complete. In July 1835 he was badly wounded by Giuseppe Marco Fieschi's infernal machine in an assassination attempt against King Louis Philippe I. Pelet became a Peer of France in 1837. He became president of the General Staff's consulting committee in 1841. He was secretly sent to advise King Charles Albert of Sardinia in 1849. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1850. After Emperor Napoleon III seized power in December 1851, Pelet became a member of the Senate and the Academy of Science. He advised Napoleon III on military matters during the Crimean War. Up to the moment of his death on 20 December 1858, his mental and physical abilities remained intact. In their published works, both Pelet and Marshal Jacques MacDonald criticized Napoleon's choice of Eug√®ne de Beauharnais as commander of the Army of Italy in 1809. Their low opinion of Eug√®ne influenced later writers such as Francis Loraine Petre and J. F. C. Fuller. Historian Frederick C. Schneid believed that Pelet and MacDonald were \\"extremely biased\\" against Eug√®ne for political and personal reasons.

The tutelary shrine of a temple or the complex the two together form are sometimes called a . If a tutelary shrine is called chinju-d≈ç, it is the tutelary shrine of a Buddhist temple. Even in that case, however, the shrine retains its distinctive architecture. Chinjugami A chinjugami is the tutelary kami of a specific area or building, as for example a village or a Buddhist temple. The term today is a synonym of ujigami (clan's tutelary ancestor) and , however the three words had originally a different meaning. While the first refers to a clan's ancestor and the second to the tutelary kami of one's birthplace, chinjugami is the tutelary kami of a given place, highly respected and venerated. The concepts were however sufficiently close to fuse together with the passing of time. History leftThe frequent presence, even today, of a Shinto shrine near or in a Buddhist temple has its roots in the efforts made by the Japanese to reconcile local kami worship with imported Buddhism. (For details, see article Shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç.) One of the first such efforts was made during the Nara period (710‚Äì794) with the founding of so-called shrine-temples (jing≈´- ji), complexes consisting of a shrine dedicated to some kami and of a Buddhist temple.Mark Teeuwen in Breen and Teeuwen (2000:95-96) This syncretic solution is believed to have its roots in the Chinese qi√©-l√°n-shen ( in Japanese), tutelary gods of Chinese temples. The reason for Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines to be constructed together was the belief that kami, like humans, needed salvation through the power of Buddha. Kami were then thought to be subject to karma and reincarnation like human beings, and early Buddhist stories tell how that the task of helping suffering kami was assumed by wandering monks. A local kami would appear in a dream to the monk, telling him about his suffering. To improve the kami's karma through Buddhist rites and the reading of s≈´tras, the monk would build a temple next to the kami's shrine. Such groupings were created already in the 7th century, for example in Usa, Ky≈´sh≈´, where kami Hachiman was worshiped together with Miroku Bosatsu (Maitreya) at Usa Hachiman-g≈´. As a result of the creation of shrine-temple complexes, many shrines that had been open-air sites became Buddhist style groupings of buildings. At the end of the same century, Hachiman was declared to be the Dharma's tutelary kami and, a little later, a bosatsu. Shrines for him started to be built at temples (the so-called temple-shrines, or jisha), marking an important step ahead in the process of amalgamation of kami worship and Buddhism. When the great Buddha at T≈çdai-ji in Nara was built, within the temple grounds was also erected a shrine for Hachiman, according to the legend because of a wish expressed by the kami himself. After this, temples in the entire country adopted tutelary kami like Hachiman and built shrines for them. This tendency to see kami as tutelary deities was strengthened during the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868) by the terauke system. Because all shrines were by law owned and managed by a Buddhist temple, many of their kami came to be viewed as the temple's tutelary kami. As a result, until the Meiji period (1868‚Äì1912) the vast majority of all shrines were small, had no permanent priest and belonged to a Buddhist temple. With very few exceptions like Ise Shrine and Izumo Taisha, they were just part of a temple-shrine complex controlled by Buddhist clergy. Because they enshrined a local and minor tutelary kami, they were called with the name of the kami followed by terms like gongen (avatar), ubusuna, or . The term , now the most common, was rare. Examples of this kind of pre-Meiji use are Tokus≈ç Daigongen and Kanda My≈çjin. Examples of tutelary shrine * As we have seen, Hachiman played an important role in the evolution of temple-shrines, and is still the tutelary kami of many important temples, among them T≈çdai-ji, Daian-ji, Yakushi-ji and T≈ç-ji. * Akiha shrines practice a fire protection cult which originated at Akihasan Hong≈´ Akiha Jinja in Shizuoka prefecture. Because during the Edo period the shrine was under the administration of neighboring S≈çt≈ç Zen temple Sh≈´y≈ç-ji, many affiliated Akiha shrines are the tutelary shrines of a S≈çt≈ç temple.. *During the Japanese Middle Ages, many estates belonging to K≈çfuku-ji and its tutelary shrine Kasuga Taisha were given the Kasuga kami as a tutelary kami, leading to the spread of such shrines to the whole country. *Kami Inari is often the tutelary kami of Buddhist temples. * The great Hiyoshi Taisha, head of a network of more than 4000 shrines, is Enryaku-ji's chinjusha.

Their first patron is a tall terrier who comes in for spaghetti. After finishing his meal, he slowly walks toward the cash register, pretending he would pay his bill. The tall terrier discloses that he has nothing to pay as he quickly exits the door and gives the bistro operators a raspberry. Nevertheless, Oswald and the girl beagle just laugh, knowing they can prevent other customers from running off. Coming in next is the boy beagle with an appetite for pancakes. As he receives his order and tries to take a nibble, the boy beagle finds the pancakes rock solid and therefore too hard to chew on, much to his disgust. He then starts tossing them around, prompting Oswald to tell him that such actions come at a price. Refusing to give a cent, the boy beagle heads toward the door. Before he could do so, however, he is nabbed by the robotic cash register that shakes off every single coin he has. The third customer is a big bear who orders a ham sandwich. Oswald cracks an egg which turns into a chick and cools itself and while he is in the kitchen, the bear starts flirting the girl beagle, and Oswald is aware of it. Irritated by that, Oswald saws out of two square wooden boards and glues them in between. The bear then receives and takes a bite of the false sandwich, thus resulting in cracked and chipped teeth. Provoked, the bear goes into a frenzy. Oswald, however, is able to evade and fend off the bear's aggression, as the bear tries to catch Oswald but got knocked by Oswald's plan, which is the cash register's money drawer. The bear landed on the floor hitting a cabinet with drawers forcing the bear to feel dazed. Upon bringing their unruly client down, Oswald the girl beagle put corn kernels plus a lighted oil lamp in the bear's trousers. The corn starts popping inside and the bear runs away hysterically.

The worms live out of sight in burrows under the sand and produce casts which are visible on the surface. Polychaetes, or marine bristle worms, have elongated bodies divided into many segments. Each segment may bear setae (bristles) and parapodia (paddle-like appendages). Some species live freely, either swimming, crawling or burrowing, and these are known as \\"errant\\". Others live permanently in tubes, either calcareous or parchment-like, and these are known as \\"sedentary\\". Description A. pacifica is a large worm growing up to fifteen centimetres in length with an elongated, segmented body which is tapered at both ends. The head has no appendages, palps or eyes but has a prostomium and evertable oesophagus. The body is divided into three regions which are sometimes differently coloured. The segments are wider than they are long and most have setae borne on parapodia. There are between four and seven pairs of oesophageal caeca, the anterior one being larger than the others. There are some capillary setae and the segments in the middle region bear up to thirteen trunk-like sets of gills which are red due to the hemoglobin circulating in the blood. The neuropodia of these segments are short and widely separated ventrally. There are no setae on the segments of the posterior region.Marine Biodiversity of British Columbia Distribution and habitat A. pacifica is found in the intertidal and subtidal zones round the coasts of North America between Alaska and northern California and in Japanese waters. It is found living under the surface of sand flats and muddy shores, and in estuaries where it can tolerate salinities of as low as 23% of normal seawater for short periods, although 50% is a more sustainable level.Oglesby L. C., 173. Salt and water balance in lugworms (Polychaeta: Arenicolidae) with particular reference to Abarenicola pacifica in Coos Bay, Oregon. Biol.Bull. 145: 180-199. Biology Like other lugworms, A. pacifica lives under the sand in a \\"J\\" shaped burrow with its head at the bottom and its tail near the surface. It is a deposit feeder and the head is constantly swallowing muddy sand. This creates a shallow depression on the surface. The cleaner sand, with nutrients removed, is expelled through the posterior end of the worm and ends up as a neat pile of coiled sand on the surface. Bacteria and microfauna may colonise the worm's gut and enrich the faecal casts. Some beaches may have fifty to a hundred lugworms per square metre and the sand is consequently being perpetually recycled by the worms. The lugworm maintains a constant stream of water through the burrow by the alternate contraction and dilatation of its body segments. Gas exchange is facilitated by the bushy tufts of gills which project from its middle region and which continually turn and flex. These adaptations to life under the sediment provide protection for the worm from desiccation and predation while providing a plentiful supply of food and oxygen. At low tide, when the sediment in which the lugworm is living is no longer covered by water, aerial respiration takes place.The Effects of Oxygen Concentration and Anoxia on Respiration of Abarenicola pacifica and Lumbrineris zonata (Polychaeta) When feeding, A. pacifica everts its oesophagus (which then resembles a mushroom) and engulfs a \\"mouthful\\" of sand before restoring the oesophagus to its rightful position. Organic detritus and organisms such as nematodes, diatoms, bacteria and microphytes Abarenicola pacifica are ingested with the sand and digested in the gut. Periodically, the worm reverses up its burrow and defecates near the surface, creating a mound of coiled cast. Individuals of A. pacifica are either male or female. Reproduction occurs once a year in the spring at a time when the worm has a high level of stored fats.Taghon, G. L., F. G. Prahl, M. Sparrow, and C. M Fuller. 1994. Lipid class and glycogen content of the lugworm Abarenicola pacifica in relation to age, growth rate, and reproductive condition. Marine Biology 120:287-295. The embryos are brooded in the burrow. The larvae do not feed and only spend a short time drifting in the water, or possibly none at all.Wilson, W. H., Jr. 1981. Sediment-mediated interactions in a densely populated infaunal assemblage: the effects of the polychaete Abarenicola pacifica. Journal of Marine Research 39:735-748. When they have developed to five or six segments, they leave their mother's burrow and start living independently in the top few millimetres of substrate. They grow rapidly and become mature in one to two years.Linton, D. L. and G. L. Taghon. 2000. Feeding, growth, and fecundity of Abarenicola pacifica in relation to sediment organic concentration. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology 254:85-107. Ecology Pinnixa schmitti, the Schmitt pea crab, is a commensal of A. pacifica and is often found cohabiting in its burrow. The crab may benefit from the protective environment but it is unclear whether the worm gains from the arrangement.O‚ÄôClair, R.M. and C.E. O‚ÄôClair. 1998. Southeast Alaska‚Äôs rocky shores: animals. Plant Press, Auke Bay, AK. 564 pp. A. pacifica may be useful in the recovery of beaches from the effects of oil pollution. The worm helps transport sediment from lower depths to the surface where aerobic microbes can break down the pollutant hydrocarbons.Augenfeld, J. M. 1980. Effects of Prudhoe Bay crude oil contamination on sediment working rates of Abarenicola pacifica. Marine Environmental Research 3: 307-313. It is considered to be useful as an indicator species for monitoring ecological conditions after an oil spillage, being the second most useful organism after the Baltic clam (Macoma balthica). This is because of the abundance of the lugworm and its widespread distribution near oil facilities.Lees, D. C., W. B. Driskell, J. R. Payne, and M .O. Hayes. 2001. Final report of CIRCAC intertidal reconnaissance survey in Upper Cook Inlet. Prepared for Cook Inlet Regional Citizens Advisory Council, Kenai, AK. The burrowing activities of A. pacifica may also cause the release of methylmercury and other heavy metals from underlying sediments into the water above. The breeding success of clams such as Macoma and Mya spp. is reduced when A. pacifica is present. Disturbance to the sediment has also been associated with a decline in the abundance of the polychaete Pygospio elegans and the crustacean Cumella vulgaris, both of which happen to be predators on juvenile lugworms. The rock sandpiper (Calidris ptilocnemis), the shrimp (Crangon spp.) and the isopod, Saduria entomon prey on both adults and young.

The sect was originally an effort to organize Shint≈ç teachings into a coherent structure in order to assert its authority vis-a-vis Buddhism. However, by the Edo period, Yoshida Shint≈ç continued to dominate the Shint≈ç discourse, and influenced Neo-Confucian thinkers such as Hayashi Razan and Yamazaki Ansai in formulating a Neo-Confucian Shinto doctrine (). Yoshida Shinto's dominance rivaled that of Ise Shint≈ç.  Doctrine  Yoshida Shint≈ç reversed the honji suijaku teaching of Shin-Butsu Shuugo promulgated by Kukai in the Heian Period, asserting that the Buddhist deities were manifestations of the Shint≈ç kami, not the other way around. Yoshida Shinto held that Shint≈ç was the primal religion of the world, which in turn gave rise to Buddhism and Confucianism. However, Shint≈ç was seen not only as the source of creation, but also as the source of all principle in the world. In this sense, Shinto was seen as a divine essence or energy rather than a teaching.Scheid 2000 This essence was seen as present in all beings at birth, but obscured petty desires and needs, which prevented Man from aligning himself with the Way of the Gods. Among the ethic \\"principles\\" in Yoshida Shint≈ç and took on a great meaning within the sect. These key virtues were linked to well-known Shint≈ç rites as harae or misogi purification ceremonies. Yoshida Shinto redefined and redesigned such traditional rites in a fashion borrowed from Esoteric Buddhism. Also, its doctrines are formulated in the elliptical discourse of Esoteric Buddhism, which makes sense only in combination with ritual practice.Scheid 2000, pp. 138‚Äì139 Rites took on significance not just as an outward form of purity, but as means to achieve inner purity as well and cultivating the necessary virtues towards makoto. These concepts may be related to Buddhist salvation but in contrast to Buddhism, Yoshida Shinto rejected celibacy and the idea that human life always leads to suffering. There is no clear conception of the afterlife, however. Yoshida Shint≈ç was an esoteric tradition also in terms of priestly organisation in that it consisted of several ranks achieved through secret initiations, with the highest rank accorded to only one man at a time, who would carry on the Yoshida family name. In cases where a suitable heir was lacking, one was adopted.  History  In spite of their alleged antiquity, Yoshida doctrines were created by Yoshida Kanetomo (1435‚Äì1511) who served the Imperial Court in the Department of Shint≈ç Affairs. Yoshida Shinto gained prominence during the Momoyama period, when the family was involved in the deification of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and enhanced its influence during the Edo period under Yoshikawa Koretaru (1616‚Äì94), a Yoshida scion (but not a family member) with excellent contacts to the ruling elites in Edo. Koretaru was probably the driving force behind the fact that the Yoshida were decreed the de facto supervisors of all lesser Shinto shrines in the official \\"Regulations for Shrine priests\\" (Shosha negi kannushi hatto Ë´∏Á§æÁ¶∞ÂÆúÁ•û‰∏ªÊ≥ïÂ∫¶) of 1665. Later, however, Koretaru created his own version of Shint≈ç (Yoshikawa Shint≈ç) with an emphasis on self-reflection and the nature of the Kami to Man, as well as Man's role in society (with an emphasis on the lord-vassal relationship common during this period).Scheid 2002 Early Neo-Confucian scholars in Japan such as Hayashi Razan and Yamazaki Ansai likely encountered Yoshida Shint≈ç during their time as Buddhist priests, when guest lectures by Yoshida Shint≈ç priests were common. However, later when Neo-Confucian teachings gained prominence, these thinkers formulated their own theories and doctrines on the relationship between Confucianism and Shint≈ç and criticized Yoshida Shint≈ç for being influenced by Buddhism. Nevertheless, Yoshida vocabulary and Yoshida ideas can still be found in their writings. This trend persisted until the rise of National Learning which sought to separate Shint≈ç from both Buddhism and Confucianism and thus developed a completely new discourse on the native kami.Nosco 1996, pp. 170‚Äì173 In terms of institutional history, Yoshida Shint≈ç was dominant until the late Edo period but decreased rapidly during the 19th century and has left hardly any trace in contemporary Japanese shrine worship. The Yoshida family's collection of ancient texts, however, still forms one of the most important sources of Shinto. Large parts of it are now stored in the library of Tenri University in Nara Prefecture.

Tamil is the place where 21 Siddhars (saints) men as well as women from different religion, had their Jeeva- Samadhis (meaning, where the Siddhars left their human forms behind, while they are still alive as holy spirits). Here in Melmaruvathur Adiparashakti Siddhar Peetam, the divine mother Adhi para sakthi transmigrates into Arulthiru Bangaru Adigalar thereby promoting spirituality and devotion. History Where the current temple's sanctum sanctorum stands today, there was only a neem tree in the 1960s. Unlike every other neem tree, which bear bitter tasting fruit, this tree secreted and dripped a sweet nectar. Residents of that village found that they had an urge in their mind to taste this nectar whenever they passed by this tree. Since many passers reported of curing their illness and diseases after tasting this nectar, the word spread swiftly to entire village and its neighborhood. So it became a customary for these villagers to take a drop of this nectar to ailing friends and relatives. They treated this as a medicinal tree and protected it from grazing cattle and wood cutters. In 1966, a severe storm uprooted this neem tree, which exposed the Swayambu underneath to the villagers for the first time. Swayambu means A self emerging, naturally formed oval shaped object (carved of rock). People built a small hut on top of this Swayambu and conducted poojas (prayer rituals) to it. This place is known as Siddhar Peetam (Siddhar in Tamil language means enlightened or evolved souls. Peetam means throne. Thus Siddhar Peetam means The Throne of Evolved Souls or Great Spiritual Masters/Gurus) where 21 Siddhars are laid in Jeeva Samaadhi. Swayambu alone was worshipped for many years. The idol of Mother Adhi para sakthi was installed later in the sanctum sanctorum on 25 November 1977. The idol of beautiful Mother is three feet tall, seated on thousand-petal lotus seat, with her right leg folded and the left leg resting on the lotus petals. The thousand petal lotus has significance in meditation. In this idol form, She holds the bud of a lotus in her right hand, the mudhra (sign) of knowledge in her left hand and with her hair plait and knotted upwards like a crown. Principles of the Siddhar Peetam The basic tenet of Melmaruvathur Adhiparasakthi Siddhar Peetam is One Mother, One Humanity, means the whole human race is one and all the human beings who inhabit this vast earth are children of Mother Goddess. Amma has revolutionized the concept of spirituality and to enter the sanctum sanctorum and perform the daily rituals and prayers to the Mother AdhiParaSakthi. The main objective for which the Siddhar Peetam strives is the cult of Sakthi that is, the whole humanity is born of one omnipotent Mother and hence the whole humanity is one, should be upheld, and each an everyone's grievances should be removed. Here in Melmaruvathur Adhiparasakthi Siddhar Peetam, during the transmigration Adigalar (AMMA) tells Arulvakku (oracle). Through the Arulvakku (oracle) Adhi parasakthi herself speaks to her devotees, this is the unique specialty of this Siddhar Peetam. Hearing the Goddess Adhiparasakthi's oracle is a great spiritual experience, this miracle takes place at Siddhar peetam. Arul Thiru Bangaru Adigalar is called by his devotees as AMMA (means Mother), here in Siddhar Peetam whatever \\"AMMA\\" says is the law and it is administered under the guidance of 'AMMA' which is a divine administration. InMelmaruvathur, women are permitted to perform poojas in the sanctum sanctorum. The layout of the Temple is as follows OM Sakthi Stage The Om Sakthi Stage at the entrance. On the highway in front of the Siddhar Peetam there is a stage with the mantra of \\"OmSakthi\\" on it. Soolam (Trishul - Trident) of the Mother is erected on this stage. The devotees entering the Peetam to worship the Mother, first go round this stage thrice and then enter the Peetam. Since the AdhiParaSakthi is the Mother Origin of everything, there is no Nava Grahas (9 Planets) that are usually found in all other Hindu Temples. The Mother has ascertained, \\"Those who surrender to me, need not pray to the planetary Lords. They are my officers who carry out the work of implementing my Law of Karma. The Sanctum Sanctorum faces the entrance where OM Sakthi stage is located. Inside this sanctorum is the Swayambu and Mother's idol. The sanctorum is only about 10X10 feet room.\\" Putrumandapam Putrumandapam The Mother in order to keep blessing people at all times, dwells in the snake pit (putrumandapam) in the form of a cobra. The Mother appears before the devotees who stay in the mandapam (Hall) at nights, in the form of a snake till this day. It is the putrumandapam where the Mother gives her Oracle. Saptha Kanniyar  Saptha Kanniyar Kovil Saptha Kanniyar Kovil (The Temple of Seven Virgins) to the right of putrumandapam. Normally the temple of the virgins will never have a roof. So also this temple of the virgins, with wall on four sides has no roof. To ascertain the fact that all are her children and that She doesn‚Äôt differentiate between any of us, the Mother ordained the local Harijans (considered to be low caste people in India) to construct the Saptha Kanniyar (Saptha means seven and Kanni means virgin. Kanniyar is plural for virgins) worship center within the Temple. In 1974, the Saptha (Seven) Kanni (Virgin Angels) Sannidhi (Temple) was consecrated in Melmaruvathur Adhiparasakthi Siddhar Peetam, Tamil Nadu, India. As with everything else in Melmaruvathur, Saptha Kanniyar (Virgin Mothers) and their Temple is also unique, transcends the traditional and emphasizes the fundamental Universal Nature of these Mothers. Seven Angels are Saptha Matre, Saptha Matrikas, Saptha Kannikas, etc. Also, some of these sources attempt to differentiate between Matrikas, Matre and Virgin Angels, although in reality, they are one and the same. In all Hindu scripts and Devi Mahatmyam, one will note that Saptha Kannikas are mentioned as Parivaara Devataas of Aadhi paraa shakti. Among the millions of Parivaara Devataas, these Seven Virgin Mothers carry special place in Aadhi para shakti as depicted in Sri Yantra (Sri Chakra). The seven nodes in the middle line of the First Enclosure (Prathama Aavaranaa) are occupied by the Saptha Kannikas, namely Brahmi, Mahe‚Äôshwari, Kowmaari, Vaishnavi, Vaaraahi, Indraani, and Chaamundi . The eighth node is occupied by Mahalakshmi. Traditionally, all the Hindu Temples in villages and rural areas of India, these seven virgin mothers are consecrated as seven stones and worshipped as formless. These shrines are often called ‚ÄúKanni Kovil‚Äù meaning ‚ÄúVirgin Temples‚Äù.

The windows are three-paned vertically within each casement; feature windows have columns supporting Moorish-arched openings. The living and dining rooms contain large bay windows. Outside, an arcade leads to the swimming pool, where privacy from the street is provided by a pyramid-roofed bath house and garden walls. According to William J. Hawkins, III and William F. Willingham, these elements \\"add to the unity of the entire architectural composition, giving a handsome facade to the public street, yet providing a great variety of private spaces behind the house and walled gardens to the rear.\\" The architect, Herman Brookman, also designed the Congregation Beth Israel and Fir Acres, the M. Lloyd Frank Estate that became Lewis & Clark College, both in Portland. Brookman mixed architectural styles, as evidenced by the many influences seen in Bitar Mansion. History The mansion following foreclosure, April 2012 Robert and Mable Bitar purchased the house in 1951. Robert recalled that as a young boy he vowed to one day own the house. A grocery store owner and real estate investor, Robert later became an honorary consul to Lebanon and lived in the mansion until his death in 2000. While owned by the Bitar family, the home hosted First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, pianist Van Cliburn and many state governors and U.S. senators. The house was placed on the real estate market in 2006, the first time in 55 years, and sold for $1.825 million after being valued at $3.99 million by an assessor for Multnomah County. The new owners began to restore the mansion to its original condition with building renovations and searching for furnishings in the original Doernbecher style. Since 2010, the house has fallen into disrepair and been foreclosed. On August 22, 2011, the house was auctioned off at the Multnomah County Courthouse. The property was purchased by ReconTrust Company, an affiliate of Bank of America, for $1.605 million. In December 2011 the home sold for $870,000. Willamette Week included the house on their \\"Best of Portland 2012\\" list as the \\"Best Barometer of the Real Estate Market\\", signifying the bottom of the economic market. As of 2011, the house remains the most expensive sold in Southeast Portland.

It premiered on Saturday, November 5, at 8 pm ET/PTRose McGowan in Lifetime's The Pastor's Wife on the Lifetime Network.\\"Lifetime Announces 2011-12 Slate\\" (scroll down to The Pastor's Wife) Plot Mary Winkler is a housewife and mother of three daughters who is married to Matthew Winkler, a pastor who is admired by many in his community for his friendliness and his views about family values. To many in town the Winklers are seen as a perfect family with Matthew as a perfect husband and wonderful father and Mary as a dutiful wife and mother. However, early one morning at the Winkler's home, a shotgun blast is heard by the Winkler children. Mary takes the children away in the car on a sudden trip, with the children wondering what happened to their father. Concerned neighbors investigate the Winkler home that night, finding Matthew dead in a bedroom with a shotgun wound. Fearing the Winkler family has been kidnapped, the local and state authorities and FBI issues an Amber alert for the Winklers. Eventually a patrol car finds Mary and her children but they also find a shotgun in her car and apprehend Mrs. Winkler. Later the shotgun is identified as the murder weapon. At the station, Mary admits she may have shot her husband, which shocks the community and her parents-in-law. At first Mary refuses to divulge more about the incident and refuses to say anything negative about her husband. But her lawyer convinces her to reveal a darker, hidden side of Matthew. Mary reveals that Matthew, despite his kind pastor image, was an angry and abusive man who engaged in physical and emotional abuse when she did something that angered him. She had never revealed this to anyone because her religious beliefs led her to silence. Matthew threatened to hurt or kill her to make her keep quiet. Mary also revealed Matthew tried to tax cheat the money she won in a lottery in order to pay their bills by having her put it in an account at another bank under her name. When the bank calls and asks her and her husband to meet them due to suspicions about the money, Mary tells Matthew about it on the night before he is murdered, but Matthew has no intention to follow her to the bank, citing since the account was under her name, it was her problem to deal with it. Mary refuses to reveal more of the abuses she suffered from Matthew to her lawyer, but upon learning her parents-in-law have not given her daughters her letters over what happened, making her eldest believe she murdered their father in cold blood, Mary finally reveals it in order to not lose custody of her daughters. Mary reveals to the court that Matthew was a hypocrite who forced her to dress up like a hooker before they had sex and made her watch online pornography so they could reenact it even when she didn't want to. The years of abuse and financial situation was gaining its toll on Mary's mental state and what finally broke her was when hours before Matthew was killed, he tried to suffocate their baby daughter as he was unable to sleep due to the baby's cries. Unable to stand it any longer, in the early morning hours, Mary brings out the shotgun and pokes it on her sleeping husband at their bed to wake him up as she wanted to have a serious discussion with him about stopping the abuse. However, Mary was standing on a slippery rug which causes her to fall and accidentally pulls the trigger and shoots her husband. Upon realizing what she has done, a confused Mary decides to run away with her daughters. After this revelation, she tells the jury that despite the abuse she suffered, Mary still loves Matthew and never wanted to kill him, she just wanted him to stop mistreating her. After jury makes their decision, the jury finds Mary not guilty of murder but guilty of involuntary manslaughter, much to Mary's lawyers and supporters joy. Throughout the film, various people who knew or met the Winklers are interviewed about their opinions of the case. While some refuse to believe that Matthew was an abusive man and Mary was guilty and got away with murder, others believe he was and Mary was innocent and was only defending herself and her children. Even Matthew's parents are interviewed who each have their different opinions. While his mother doesn't believe in Mary's story that Matthew was abusive, Matthew's father however believes he was but thinks Mary didn't kill Matthew accidentally but purposely as revenge and is willing to forgive her if she confesses the truth.

History With the closure of Kohla Bridge in 1947, most of the trucks and buses owned by Allied Chirag Din and Sons, Nanda Bus Service, N.D. Radhakrishan and other small transport operators got held up on the other side of the border. The foremost challenge that the State of Jammu and Kashmir faced was the availability of essential commodities. The handful of private transporters did not come forward to meet the challenge. Their vehicles had to be commandeered to bring refugees from border areas but they did not co-operate with the State‚Äôs Emergency Administration. The non co- operating transporters were even jailed. The Government addressed the issue of development of road transport immediately after assuming office which led to the birth of the first-ever Government owned transport fleet on June, Ist 1948. A handful of persons were drawn virtually from the road-side both at Jammu and Srinagar to form the management to operate the 50 trucks it acquired from General Motor Corporation, Bombay along with some accessories left by the American Company. The Organisation was run as a government department in the early stages. Later it was named as Government Transport Undertaking. The J&K; State Road Transport Corporation (a successor to the erstwhile Government Transport Undertaking) came into existence on 1.9.1976 under Road Transport Corporation Act of 1950. The J&K; SRTC has played a vital role in developing the economy of the State right from the date of its inception. The JKSRTC has maintained the supply of essential commodities to every nook and corner of the State very efficiently and operates passenger bus services in all the regions within the State. It also operates services on Inter-state routes in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan. Objectives The main objectives of the Road Transport in the Public Sector in J&K; State are summarized as under: 1\\\\. To make the transport system advantageous and convenient to the Public, kargil, Tourism, Trade, Industry and various other agencies. 2\\\\. To provide an efficient and economic Road Transport Service for the traveling public both within the State and on the Interstate routes. 3\\\\. To provide for highly integrated transport system for carriage of essential commodities of the Government agencies and under the Public Distribution System. Fleet At present the Corporation has total 497 buses. In the year 1988-89, there were a total 1135 buses in the fleet of the State Road Transport Corporation but at present the number has been reduced. On operational fleet of State Road Transport Corporation and measures to prevent the state owned corporation from bankruptcy, the government stated that there are 278 buses of JKSRTC operating on different routes of the state.

Fire  The fire occurred on China National Highway 105, which links Beijing to Zhuhai, Guangdong. At 3:43 am, a fire started at the rear of the bus, rapidly consuming the bus. Upon noticing the explosion, the driver immediately pulled over to the left and stopped in 145 meters. Some of the survivors reported hearing an explosion at the back of the vehicle when the fire started. Six people, including the driver, survived and were hospitalized. As a result of the fire, the vehicle was severely damaged.  Investigation  The investigation concluded that the vehicle was illegally carrying 15 boxes of Azobisisobutyronitrile, each weighing 20 kg.It was found that at Weihai, the starting point of the route, Huichang Company worker Zhang Hui (deceased) loaded the 10 boxes on to the bus, first into the luggage area then later moved into locked toilet with another 5 loaded on later, beside the toilet, and due to the improper packaging, the motion of the vehicle and the heat generated from the engine caused it to decompose and combust.

Heroes Action Man The eponymous protagonist of the franchise, first introduced as an action figure in 1966 as a British equivalent to G.I. Joe. However, the character soon developed his own identity as an action hero, rather than being specifically a military figure. Although the appearance and backstory of Action Man has varied over time and across different media, the scar on the character's right cheek has remained consistent. In the Hasbro toy line and the Panini Comics canon, he is depicted as the leader of the heroic 'Action Force' team. He is advanced in many forms of martial arts and has a large arsenal of weapons and vehicles. In the 1995 TV series, the character is depicted is a man suffering from amnesia who leads the Action Force in their fight against the evil Dr. X and his terrorist organisation. He often has brief flashbacks of his past which are triggered by certain events. He later learns that his real name is Matthew Exler, and that he's actually the brother of Dr. X (Dorian Exler). In the 2000 TV series, Action Man was reimagined as extreme sports athlete Alex Mann of 'Team Xtreme'. He has a special ability called an AMP (Advanced Macro Probability) Factor, a result of secret experiments by his former coach Simon Grey. The AMP Factor allows Alex to see every possibility in a situation but in order to use it he has to feel a triggering adrenaline rush. Action Man was released as a G.I. Joe figure in 2004 and was a Toys R Us Night Force set exclusive.http://www.bloodforthebaron.com/toys/008/actionman/001/index.html The character was originally planned to have a starring role in an early script for G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra. The Action Man character was again rebooted by IDW Publishing in 2016 for a four-issue limited comic book series set within the Hasbro Comic Book Universe. In this series, 'Action Man' is a title held by the lead agent in the secret British intelligence operation, the Action Man Programme, with Agent Ian Noble as the current Action Man. This incarnation of the character subsequently featured in the Revolution and First Strike crossover storylines alongside several other Hasbro characters. Flynt An Australian member of Action Force introduced in 2004 alongside Red Wolf. A lover of action and extreme sports, Flynt is typically seen with his dirt rider or snowboard and was often depicted with an arm in a cast due to sporting injuries. Two action figures of Flynt were released and the character was featured regularly in Action Man comics as well as the 2004 film Action Man: Robot Atak and its sequels. His only video game appearance came in the adaptation of Robot Atak, where he was a playable character. Red Wolf An Native American archer and Action Force member introduced in 2004, alongside Flynt. As well as his bow and arrows, he is equipped with a wavin pipe and tomahawk. Three action figures were released by Hasbro, the second of which came with a canoe. In 2005, he was seen with a section of his hair died red, an indicator of the time he successfully wrestled a bear. Red Wolf was a recurring character in Panini's Action Man comic book from his introduction up to the finale of the series and featured in each of the direct-to-DVD Action Man films. He was also a playable character in the video game Action Man: Robot Atak. Natalie Poole A member of the Action Force seen in the 1995 TV series. Hasbro released a single, now rare, action figure which had a kicking action. At Joecon 2010, a convention exclusive Q-Force action figure of Natalie Poole was released and came with a 'Silent Attack' canoe.http://www.bloodforthebaron.com/toys/008/actionman/002/index.html Poole is the only female Action Man character for which Hasbro produced any toys. Knuck Williams Knuck was a military member of the Action Force in the 1995 TV series, always sporting a beret and camo gear. Like Natalie Poole, a single action figure of Knuck Williams was manufactured by Hasbro during the 1990s. Jacques A French wheelchair-bound boy and member of Action Force in the 1995 TV series. He was in charge of the team's computer works. Krunch Duane Curtis, also known as 'Krunch', was a professional boxer and ally of Action Man. A single limited edition 12\\" action figure was released by Hasbro in 1996, which included a title belt accessory. Also included in the box was a mini Action Man comic book produced by Marvel Comics, in which Krunch battles Professor Gangrene. RAID RAID (Randomly Acquired Intelligent Dog) is the pet dog of Action Man. He first appeared in the 1995 TV series and would later appear sporadically in the Panini Comics series. Several different action figures of Raid were released, the final one in 2003. RAID became the poster-dog for the SPCA after Action Man aggressively chastised him for urinating on his new rug, prompting outrage from the public. The dog who played RAID went on to have success playing Cerberus in the Broadway adaption of \\"Hercules in New York\\". Villains Dr. X Dr. X (real name Count Laszlo Huszar II, or Dorian Exler in the 1995 TV series) is the main antagonist of the franchise, introduced in 1993. He is a master scientist bent on world domination and is prepared to reach his goal by any means necessary. He is Action Man's archenemy and it is always up to Action Man and Action Force to stop his evil plans and save the world. Despite his varying appearance over the years, his bionic hand/arm and eye (sometimes covered by an eye patch) remain consistent. He is the leader of the paramilitary terrorist organisation named 'Council of Doom' and has had many villainous teammates and right hand men. In the 2000 TV series, Dr.X was depicted as a handicapped scientist who worked with Simon Grey to help humanity in case of a nuclear war. This included creating Action Man's AMP factor. However, Simon left because he thought Dr.X's methods were cruel and heartless. Unabated, Dr. X continued his work on 'neo-humanity', eventually transplanting his mind in to the body of Action Man's sporting rival Brandon Cane in an attempt to obtain immortality. In the 2016 reboot comic series by IDW Publishing, the original Doctor X dies in a confrontation with then-Action Man, Agent Mike Brogan. His corpse is destroyed by traitorous AMP Agent Mercy Gale who adopts his identity to manipulate global conflicts. Gale receives a X-shaped scar after being non-fatally shot by current Action Man, Agent Ian Noble. Professor Gangrene Gangrene is another archenemy of Action Man and the former right-hand man of Dr. X. He's known to be a master scientist, who was infected by so many diseases that he became known as Gangrene. Like Dr. X, he has had many different looks, but is easily characterized by his pale green skin and the fact that his left eye is bigger than his right. He was replaced by No-Face as Dr. X's closest associate after failing to defeat Action Man too many times. Gangrene was a recurring antagonist in the Panini comic book series and the 1995 TV series, while also featuring in the 2005 film Action Man: X-Missions - the Movie where he was voiced by Scott McNeil. Several different action figures of Gangrene were released, often featuring some kind of unique gimmick.http://www.actionmanhq.co.uk/frameset/frameset2.html Gangrene action figure produced in 2002 by Hasbro. No-Face 'No-Face' (real name 'Gerrard De Visage') was the right-hand man of Dr. X and acted as a replacement for Professor Gangrene in that role. He grew up in Belgium, before moving to the United States to train as a movie stunt man. His skills in fencing and motorsport caught the eye of Dr. X, who then lured Visage into crime with empty promises of glory. The 'No-Face' moniker comes from the hideous state of his skin, the result of a botched robbery where Visage was covered in toxic acid and suffered severe burns and scarring. No-Face is a master of disguises and his face is often covered by bandages or a mask. Following the death of Dr. X, No-Face created the 'X-Robot' army and later resurrected his master, in the hope that his services to Dr. X would one day be rewarded by the restoration of his face. A single action figure was released by Hasbro,http://www.actionmanhq.co.uk/frameset/frameset2.html 'No-Face' action Figure at Action Man HQ. but the character was featured prominently in the Panini Comics series from his 2004 introduction onwards and played a prominent role in the film Action Man: Robot Atak. Anti-Freeze A member of Dr. X's 'Council of Doom', Anti-Freeze was first introduced as a toy in 2003. His first appearance in the comic was in issue No. 89 in a strip titled \\"Anti- Freeze Attacks\\". He is a man composed of ice, but it's unknown how he came to be in that state. His main weapon is an ice staff. His final appearance was in issue No. 137 of the comic, in which he was seen swimming away from an X-Shark that had been set free by Action Man. Tempest Tempest (real name 'Templeton Storm') is a villain who has the power to control the weather using weather machines, which he began creating at a young age. He also wields twin staffs, which can shoot lightning. He was introduced in the 2000 TV series and subsequently featured in the Panini Comics series. Two varieties of action figure were released. Asazi Exclusive to the 2000 TV series and the only female Action Man villain in any media, Asazi is a notorious assassin whose signature weapon is a crossbow. Plague Locust A villain featured in the PC game Action Man: Raid on Island X, Plague Locust is an insane robotics specialist, disguised in an insect-like armoured outfit featuring a gas mask and a jetpack with insectoid wings. In the game, Action Man must venture into the jungle to fight Plague Locust and his robotic insects, in an effort to halt his plans to take control of jungle animals and use them for crime. X-Robots A robot army created by No-Face in the image of Dr. X. They were introduced in 2004 and served as a replacement for regular henchmen. Action Man was quickly able to discover the weak spot of the robots: a small panel in the centre of each robot's stomach area. They played a central role in the 2004 direct-to-DVD film Action Man: Robot Atak and its video game adaptation. In 2005, many X-Robots were upgraded by Dr. X to become 'Toxic Robots' which had blades for arms. In the 2009 Tesco exclusive range, the X-Robots were redesigned to have faces less akin to that of Dr. X. Raptors A race of dinosaur-like creatures which inhabited the 'Jungle Zone' of Island X. Professor Gangrene later created a race of 'Robo-Raptors' in issue #130 of the Panini Comics series. These were designed to overshadow No-Face's X-Robots in the hope that Gangrene could become Dr. X's right-hand man once again. The Intruder The Neanderthal-esque archenemy of Action Man and his team in the original Palitoy Action Man toy franchise. He was introduced in 1976 and sometimes seen with the dragon-like creature Gargon. The action figure featured a 'bear hug' mechanism operated by a button on the back of the doll. Other Nick Masters A TV presenter and extreme sports commentator for the TV network 'Mastervision' in the 2000 TV series. He had a public feud with Templeton Storm which led to Storm becoming Tempest. On camera, Masters appears a well-adjusted, friendly individual. However, in reality Masters is an egotistical person who will do anything for screen time no matter the collateral damage or risk to the lives of others. He later went on to work for Bank of Ireland as an accountant, solving mysteries such as why the expenses claimed by senior executives were so excessively high. Professor Moran A scientist who was kidnapped by No-Face and forced to make a mind control gas for Dr. X during the events of the 2004 Panini Comics story-arc and the 2004 film Action Man: Robot Atak. Action Force ultimately save Moran from Dr. X and free him from captivity. Brandon Cane Sporting rival of Alex Mann in the 2000 TV series. He is soon captured by Dr. X, who places his own mind into the younger, more able body of Cane. See also *List of hero and minor characters in A.T.O.M.

Prototypes for a lightweight sports coup√© were presented at various motor shows starting with the 1951 Frankfurt Motor Show and the cars were produced between 1953 and 1955. The cars The cars were derived from a design by Hans Trippel with a silhouette not unlike that of the Porsche 356, and it has been suggested that the manufacturer‚Äôs founder, Bernard Denis, dreamed of producing a French Porsche equivalent. The first car, like several lightweight sports cars appearing in France at this time, was powered by the two-cylinder boxer engine from the Panhard Dyna X (and later the Panhard Dyna Z) which produced at this stage a claimed 42 hp from 850 cc of cylinder capacity. There was a coup√© version, branded as the Marathon Corsair, and a roadster, branded as the Marathon Pirate. History The technical enthusiasts who established the Marathon car business purchased the design from Hans Trippel (1908‚Äì2001) who had been released from war-related imprisonment in 1949 and at this point was based in Stuttgart. Trippel had constructed his prototype in 1950: it already featured the stylish fast-back (and possibly Porsche inspired) body work and rear-hinged doors that would define the Marathon Corsair. Trippel‚Äôs steel-bodied prototype was propelled by a Z√ºndapp 600 cc engine producing just over 18 hp. In order to fit the larger Panhard engine, the Marathon team were obliged slightly to adapt the rear of the car, which lost a little of the cleanness of form that had characterised the Trippel prototype. At the front they also had to raise the level of the head-lights in order to conform with French regulations. By the time the car appeared at the Brussels Motor Show in January 1953, these changes had been effected, and the car‚Äôs name had been changed from Trippel to Marathon. In June 1953 Marathon‚Äôs first pre-production prototype was presented to Gilles Gu√©rithault who was managing editor of L'Auto-Journal, and who thereby obtain exclusive details of the car which would debut in production form only in October at the Paris Motor Show. By then arrangements were in place to produce the car at the Societ√© Industrielle de l'Ouest Parisien (SIOP) factory in the Boulevard de Dixmude on the western side of Paris, previously the manufacturing location for Rosengart automobiles. The production cars were not steel bodied, but were constructed from a material initially christened at the plant ‚Äúpolyester‚Äù, but which is better understood as a series of layers of glass fibre and resin, a lightweight material that would become popular with low volume producers in the UK and elsewhere for ‚Äúfibreglass‚Äù car bodies. The Marathon was something of a pioneer in this respect, and the resulting light body combined with an engine delivering more than twice the power of Trippel‚Äôs original prototype gave rise to a level of performance that was, by the standards of the time and category of the car, very lively indeed. The top speed was approximately 150 km/h (93 mph). Enthusiasts Since 2011 a Marathon Corsair is on display at the Manoir de l'Automobile at Loh√©ac in the French west.

Afterward he served with distinction in the colonies, and, after reaching the rank of brigadier, was appointed, in 1857, governor of the islands of Fernando Poo and Annob√≥n y Corisco. In 1862 he became major general, and in November of that year was made military governor and commander-in-chief of the province of Santiago de Cuba. The insurrection against the Spanish domination of Santo Domingo, which had been annexed in 1861, began in the department of Cibao in February 1863; the troops were soon driven into the coast-towns, and the interior cities wrested from them. Gandara, without waiting for orders from the home- government, despatched reinforcements to his comrades by the frigate Isabel II, then in port. He afterward received orders to march with all the forces at his command to the assistance of the commander-in-chief. He landed in Puerto Plata, 17 September 1863, driving the insurgent forces back, and afterward occupied the cities of Santo Domingo and San Crist√≥bal, the latter after a series of bloody engagements with the enemy, in 1864 he was promoted to lieutenant-general and appointed captain-general and commander-in-chief of the island, and in that year won the battle of Monte Cristi. The provisional government now began peace negotiations, which, however, led to no favorable issue. Meanwhile, the home government resolved to abandon the struggle, and in May 1865, Gandara, with his troops, evacuated the island. He subsequently received the appointment of governor-general of the Philippine islands, and, after the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, was military chief of the king's household, and captain-general of Castile. He published Historia de la Anexion y Guerra de Santo Domingo. The municipality of Gandara in the province of Samar in the Philippines is named after him.

Ralph had already written complaining of the lack of application of William Ridgeway the military engineer who seldom came to Roxburgh. Ralph was intending to collect the profits from the lands of Kelso Abbey and Melrose Abbey, and planned to set Ker of Cessford, an ally, against Walter Scott of Buccleuch to strengthen his hold on the area.

The Jungle consists of more than underneath and along an elevated section of Interstate 5 between South Dearborn Street and Lucile Street. An assessment counted 201 tents and estimated more than 400 homeless people lived in the encampment prior to a shooting on January 26, 2016 that increased scrutiny in the area. Location and ecology The Jungle is situated on the steep western slope of Beacon Hill near the south-end of Downtown Seattle. Being bound by Interstate 5 to the west and Interstate 90 to the north, the land is primarily managed by the city and state departments of transportation. The thin tract of land is about and extends south to the Georgetown neighborhood. The wooded area can be entered through Rizal Park, highway maintenance roads, or residential areas on Beacon Hill. Thick blackberry brambles and vines grow among maple and other trees in the urban forest. Various rodents‚Äîincluding rats‚Äîand numerous species of birds are common.  Population  Firsthand reports in 2016 described distinct areas within the encampment. The portions under the freeway were referred to as \\"The Caves\\" and were within easy walking distance to a nearby methadone clinic. Alcoholism was more prevalent in the southern stretch while certain residents remained more isolated in the brush to the east. A survey conducted by the city of Seattle and the United Gospel Mission later in the year determined that a total of 111 people remained in The Jungle after multiple attempts to close the encampment. Approximately 80 percent are male and 20 percent are female. 45 percent of residents were white, 45 percent were black, and 10 percent were another race. During large-scale sweep in January of 2020, 30 residents and 75 tents and other makeshift structures were counted. History Homeless people may have used the area as early as the 1930s. It gained notoriety in the 1990s when the city began razing the encampments. In 1994, about 50 campsites yielded 120 tons of trash. Periodic bulldozing in the 1990s by the city or state department of transportation led to complaints of the city providing little to no warning before enacting cleanups. Seattle's organized tent cities for the homeless are offshoots of illegal communities that formed after squatters were forcibly removed from The Jungle. Along with numerous and ongoing low profile deaths and murders, the bodies of three women murdered by a serial killer were found in the area between September 1997 and February 1998. Other deaths have included transients being struck by vehicles while attempting to cross the nearby freeways and even a homeless man was sleeping in a blackberry thicket being mowed by workers. The Jungle increasingly became a haven for criminals in the 2000s. Criminal activity has included assaults, rapes, prostitution, and murders. Residences in the Beacon Hill neighborhood complained of been burglarized by those staying in The Jungle. Gang members basing drug trade in the woods also became a concern. In the early 2000s, a gravel road was built for emergency services while brush was cleared for greater visibility. An extension of the Mountain to Sound bike corridor through the Jungle opened in the fall of 2011 in an attempt to revitalize the area. The trail features a paved path, lighting, and fences. The city attempted to clear the encampment twice a year during the mayoral term of Greg Nickels (January 1, 2002 ‚Äì January 1, 2010), but such sweeps were less frequent during Michael McGinn's term even though homelessness became more prevalent throughout the city. From 2011 to 2016, the area was the site of at least 750 incidents responded to by the Seattle Fire Department, of which 500 times were emergency medical situations. By 2016, The Jungle was considered by many as unsafe at any hour, though others argued the dangers was exaggerated by both officials and the media. Weapons, used drug paraphernalia, potentially stolen goods, and human feces were, and continue to be, seen often during the city and state sweeps. In April 2015, police arrested 20 suspects during a series of raids, including Son Van Tran, who Federal prosecutors described as a \\"boss\\" in the area's drug market. On January 26, 2016, two people were killed and three were injured during a shooting at the Jungle encampment. The shooting led to calls from Mayor Murray and other local officials to close the encampment per state trespassing laws, though homeless advocates said the city should stop closing unauthorized encampments until it has an alternative location or shelter for campers. In February, 2016, the Washington State Legislature proposed $1 million to install a , razor wire and barbed-wire fence to encircle the area. On May 17, 2016, the city of Seattle and the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) announced plans to permanently clear out The Jungle, with the estimated 300 remaining people living there to be resettled by the Union Gospel Mission. WSDOT will also clear debris from the freeway's underside and improve road access, while the city will clear the hill above the site, at a total cost of $1 million. A newer encampment formed under the Interstate 5 and Interstate 90 interchange to the northwest of the Jungle, dubbed \\"The New Jungle\\" or \\"The Triangle\\" by local media. While sweeps continued, ongoing reports of gunfire and drug abuse triggered a larger police intervention in January 2020. Authorities made seven arrests and identified a large tent in the middle of the encampment where crack, meth, and heroin were sold.

The palms of the hands are typically touching the sides of the body and the toes are typically touching the ground. Some players compete to find the most unusual and original location in which to play. The term planking refers to mimicking a wooden plank. Planking can include lying flat on a flat surface, or holding the body flat while it is supported in only some regions, with other parts of the body suspended. Many participants in planking have photographed the activity in unusual locations and have shared such pictures through social media. Planking gained popularity and eventually notoriety from late 2010 to early 2011 in Australia. History A planking- like activity, called face dancing by its participants, was initiated in 1984 in Edmonds in the US by Scott Amy and Joel Marshall. The two high school age boys were walking in a park when they came upon a baseball game. They decided to lie face down in right field to see if anyone would react. The first video- recorded occurrence of planking was in 1994 when Tom Green performed a stunt he called \\"Dead Guy\\" for a cable TV show, which consisted of Green lying down on an Ottawa sidewalk without moving. Green, who was in an MTV show in the 1990s, is a comedian known for his pranks. He informed CNN about this video evidence and how it did not air on the show, stating that it was \\"a very obscure piece of video.\\" Green tweeted \\"Just found video of me #planking in 1994. I will post it soon. Let people know. :)\\" on July 12, 2011. However, the video sketch was never aired. So when, in 1997, two bored school boys in Taunton, England, started lying face-down in public places to amuse themselves and baffle onlookers, they could not have known of Green's stunt. Gary Clarkson (then aged 15) and Christian Langdon (then aged 12) called it the \\"lying down game\\". As Clarkson puts it, \\"It was just a really stupid, random thing to do.\\" The Lying Down Game remained within Clarkson and Langdon's circle of friends until 2007, when their friend Daniel Hoppin created a Facebook page for their craze. As Hoppin says, \\"We began a Facebook group to see who could get the craziest photo.\\" The term \\"Planking\\" was coined by Sam Weckert, Darcy McCann and Kym Berry of Adelaide, South Australia: \\"Planking was a term myself and two other mates came up with in the summer of 2008\\". Weckert created a Facebook fan page to share \\"planking\\" photos. After reports of the practice started appearing in the Australian media, it grew rapidly and the meme became a global phenomenon. After reports of the craze in the British media in 2009, Planking spread to the rest of the world. Worldwide it has also been known as \\"extreme lying down\\" (2008, Australasia), \\"facedowns\\" (2010, USA and Ireland), and \\"planking\\" (2011, Australia, New Zealand and worldwide). In the years following its explosion in popularity, several variations on planking have proliferated, some inspired by the fad, and others that have arisen independently.  Controversies  The popularity of planking has generated a backlash. Some people object to the more ridiculous photos that have circulated, such as a girl planking with her head in a toilet or a woman planking on a stripper pole. Also, planking in dangerous places has resulted in many injuries and at least one death.  Notable incidents  * The planking fad made news in September 2009, when seven accident and emergency staff working at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon, England were suspended for playing the \\"lying down game\\" during a night shift and posting photos to Facebook. They were considered to have breached health and safety and infection control regulations. * On 15 May 2011, Acton Beale, a 20-year-old man, plunged to his death after reportedly \\"planking\\" on a seventh-floor balcony in Brisbane, Australia. The Darwin Awards recognized this incident in their 2011 edition. * On 29 May 2011, Max Key, son of New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, uploaded to Facebook a photograph of himself planking on a lounge suite, his father standing behind him. Afterwards, the photograph was reproduced on the front page of the New Zealand Herald.\\"PM's son named 'New Zealand's top planker'\\" Yahoo News/AFP (31 May 2011) Confirming that the photograph was indeed genuine, John Key remarked that he doesn't see anything wrong with planking when done safely. Key was criticized for his appearance in the photograph, with some going as far as to comment that he \\"killed\\" the meme. * On 2 September 2011, Dwight Howard and about 100 of his fans planked in Beijing, China as part of a promotional Adidas campaign. * On 20 January 2012, Pat Barry planked on television after a mixed martial arts match in which he won a knockout victory over his opponent. This was broadcast in the United States and internationally.  In popular culture  * The fall 2011 season premiere of the U.S. version of The Office featured several employees planking in the parking lots, the restroom, on desks, and on top of file cabinets. *American hip hop artists Kanye West and Jay-Z reference planking in their 2011 single \\"Gotta Have It\\". * In \\"Faith Hilling\\", the 28 March 2012 episode of the animated American TV series South Park, trends such as planking were parodied. *Regina Spektor planks multiple times in her 2012 music video for \\"Don't Leave Me (Ne Me Quitte Pas)\\". *American rapper Eminem references planking in his 2013 song \\"Rap God\\". *In the 2014 animated film Mr. Peabody and Sherman, Mr. Peabody, the talking, genius dog claims to have invented planking. *On July 6, 2019, Israel Adesanya referenced planking in a commentary of \\"UFC 239: Jones vs. Santos\\" after Jorge Masvidal delivered the fastest knockout in UFC history. * Throughout the Super Smash Bros. series starting with Melee, one of Luigi's victory animations in multiplayer matches shows him planking twice, to comical effect.

This variation was created by teachers in Mortlake College in an attempt to create a new 'craze' after noticing the amount of attention given to planking. * Playing Dead (known as \\"ÏãúÏ≤¥ÎÜÄÏù¥\\" in Korean) originated in South Korea in 2003. It involves a large number of participants pretending to be dead. It was inspired by the manga character Crayon Shin-Chan and is thought to have arisen independently of planking. * Hadoukening also known as Makankosappo, involves multiple people staging a ‚ÄúKi attack‚Äù knockout sequence and photographing themselves in mid-action, posed like in the popular Japanese fighting arcade game Street Fighter or manga series Dragon Ball. * Gallon smashing involves a person spilling a gallon of liquid (usually milk), then \\"falling\\" and having a hard time getting back up. * Vadering mimics Darth Vader‚Äôs Force Choke hold. One person has their hand up in a choking gesture, while their ‚Äúvictim‚Äù looks to be raised off the ground while clutching at their neck. Owling (and planking) in the snow * Owling is a variation on planking in which a person squats \\"like an owl\\" in a populated but unusual area. Participants commonly make noises similar to an owl, to make the owl impression more realistic. It was first documented on 11 July 2011 in a post on the social news website reddit.Owling the new planking. YouTube. Retrieved on 2012-01-19. * Horsemaning involves posing two people so that they appear to be a single body with a detached head and is a revival of a photography fad popular in the 1920s. It is thought that the name comes from the Headless Horseman in Washington Irving's short story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.'Planking' is Dead; Long Live 'Horsemaning' [SLIDESHOW] ‚Äì International Business Times. Ibtimes.com (2011-08-11). Retrieved on 2012-01-19. Batmanning * Batmanning involves hanging upside down by the feet.Batmanning is a Christian Bale stunt with an Adam West flavour Sept 11 2011, The Guardian's Sam Leith * Dufnering is a variation of planking that involves a person lying with the bottom half of their body on the floor, the top half leaning up, their arms close to the side of their body, and their hands ending towards the bottom of their thighs. The person would also be looking straightforward. The fad began when Rory McIlroy tweeted a photo of himself imitating 2013 PGA Championship winner Jason Dufner. * Pratting is a variation of planking that was spawned from a scene in the film Jurassic World in which Chris Pratt's character uses a defensive posture in order to save himself from velociraptors while inside of their cage. The pose requires the user to have their knees slightly bent, head forward, arms extended out far (sometimes with one closer to the subject) and fingers up. Immediately following the film's wide release, many zookeepers posted images of themselves in similar formation with their respective animals.  Football-related  Tim Tebow's original \\"tebowing\\" position * Tebowing is a phenomenon that began to spread in October 2011. It involves imitating National Football League quarterback Tim Tebow's habit of getting down on one knee, resting one or both arms across the upright knee, and bowing his head, especially in a setting where others are doing something unrelated. * Gronking: Toucher and Rich, of Boston's 98.5FM sports talk radio station, started a trend for New England Patriots fans to compete with Tebowing during the 2011 NFL season. Rob Gronkowski, a player for the Patriots, was known for spiking the football in a very characteristic manner. Replacing the football with any inanimate object and spiking it when Gronkowski made a touchdown became known as Gronking.Toucher & Rich: Patriots Rob Gronkowski Talks Denver Broncos Defense, 'Gronking' ¬´ CBS Boston. Boston.cbslocal.com (2011-12-15). Retrieved on 2012-01-19. * Bradying: After the loss to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLVI, a photograph of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady spread throughout the Internet, with him sitting down with his head lowered and hands clasped between his legs. The picture was taken after Brady threw an interception late in the game. Unlike \\"Gronking\\" and \\"Tebowing\\", Bradying is not considered a \\"celebration\\". Many called Tebowing the pose of 2011, and Bradying the pose of 2012. However, Tebowing.com creator Jared Kleinstein claimed that the pose would not catch on for long, suggesting that it was too negative. * Griffining: Rookie Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III (RGIII)'s first NFL touchdown pass was an 88-yard pass play to Pierre Garcon against the New Orleans Saints. In the process of throwing the pass, Griffin was knocked to the ground, and watched the rest of the play from that position. As Garcon streaked across the goal- line, Griffin, seated on the turf, thrust his hands in the air showing a #1 with both index fingers, thereby spawning the Griffining Internet meme. The Griffining movement began in earnest when Brent from @BurgundyBlog tweeted, \\"How has the sitting-down-arms-up posture not yet incited a 'Griffining' meme?\\" Soon afterward, the Griffining pose was featured on an ESPN segment and on the front page of The Washington Post. Robert Griffin III was later asked how he felt about the new meme by ESPN's Rick Reilly and he responded with, \\"Who would have thought getting knocked on your butt and throwing a touchdown would start a phenomenon like that? I‚Äôm not opposed to it. It‚Äôs pretty funny to me.\\" * Kaepernicking: In the 2012-13 NFC Divisional Playoffs between the San Francisco 49ers and Green Bay Packers, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick celebrated a touchdown by flexing his right arm and kissing his bicep. Afterwards, 49ers fans began posting photos online of themselves performing the pose, and Kaepernick had retweeted other fans' photos of the pose on Twitter. However, USA Today pointed out that Kaepernicking had already been performed by other athletes prior to the game, including wrestler Scott Steiner, Steve Nash, and Metta World Peace. Kaepernick later trademarked the pose.

It is separated from other gold rushes by the ease with which gold could be obtained. Much of the gold was lying in the beach sand of the landing place and could be recovered without any need for a claim. Nome was a sea port without a harbor, and the biggest town in Alaska. Together with the Klondike Gold Rush (1896‚Äì1899) and Fairbanks Gold Rush (1903‚Äì1911), Nome was among the biggest gold rushes north of 60 degrees latitude on the North American continent. It shared prospectors with both Klondike and later rushes like Fairbanks. It is memorialized in films like North to Alaska. Nome City still exists and the area is mined as Nome mining district and by tourists. Total production of gold from the area is estimated to be 112 metric tons. History Prehistory The center of the Nome Gold Rush was the town of Nome at the outlet of Snake River on the Seward Peninsula at Norton Sound of the Bering Sea. Inupiaq Eskimos had camped for centuries in the Nome area before Russians came. In the 18th century, they established the port of St. Michael, 125 miles to the southeast, for sailing on the Yukon River. Fur traders and whalers from many countries visited the area. A few church missions were established beginning in the 1880s.University Library Washington , retrieved 2011-12-21 Gold was found in smaller amounts at Council 1897, the year before Nome, and subsequently other places in the area. Discovery View of beach west of Nome, 1900. Tents and mining equipment are seen. In September 1898, the \\"Three Lucky Swedes\\": Norwegian-American Jafet Lindeberg, and two American citizens of Swedish birth, Erik Lindblom and John Brynteson, discovered gold on Anvil Creek and founded Nome mining district. News of the discovery reached the outside world that winter. By 1899, Nome had a population of 10,000 many of whom had arrived from the Klondike gold rush area. In that year, gold was found in the beach sands for dozens of miles along the coast at Nome, which spurred the stampede to new heights. Thousands more people poured into Nome during the spring of 1900 aboard steamships from the ports of Seattle and San Francisco. More gold seekers from the distant city of Adelaide, Australia set out for Nome aboard the schooner Inca in 1902.San Francisco Call, Volume 93, Number 165, 14 May 1903 ‚Äì From Australia to Nome By 1900, a tent city on the beaches and on the treeless coast reached 30 miles, from Cape Rodney to Cape Nome. Claim jumping Many late-comers were jealous of the original discoverers, and tried to \\"jump\\" the original claims by filing claims covering the same ground. The federal judge for the area ruled the original claims valid, but some of the claim jumpers agreed to share their invalid claims with influential U.S. politicians. One of these, Alexander McKenzie, a Republican from North Dakota, took interest in the gold rush and seized mining claims with the help of a crooked judge, Arthur H. Noyes.The Nome Gold Rush, Alaska Science Forum, retrieved 2011-12-21 Mckenzie's claim-jumping scheme was eventually stopped by the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals; however, the episode provided the plot for Rex Beach's best-selling novel The Spoilers (1906), which was made into a stage play and movies, most famously The Spoilers (1942) starring John Wayne.World Port Source, retrieved 2011-12-21 Because of the unrest Fort Davis was established 1900 at the mouth of Nome River, 4 miles east of Nome City.

Creeks Panning creeks for gold in Alaska is slow and cold. As in Klondike there was a layer of permafrost just below the surface. In Nome different kinds of equipment were used to thaw the ground and suck up gravel. The mining methods used were extensive meaning that the amount of soil processed was more important than the efficiency of the equipment that separated gold from sand. By hydraulic methods soil was washed off the creek banks and into sluices either by gravity or suction. Dredges and in some cases mine shafts were used. To facilitate digging the ground was softened with steam.Picture of shaft mining with steam, retrieved 2011-12-21 Steam was also used for collecting dumps of gravel in the winter.

Messages could be sent from Nome to St. Michael and from there by cable to Seattle. Nome had no harbor for ships during the rush, only one for local boats. Ships anchored offshore and people were shuttled ashore in boats.Picture of boat coming ashore, retrieved 2011-12-21 In early summer the coast could still be covered with ice.

Between 1900‚Äì1909 Nome's estimated population reached as high as 20,000; in the census of 1909 the population at Nome had dropped to 2600. The rush was over, but gold mining continues to the present (2015) and every year prospectors arrive to look for gold. Total gold production for the Nome district is at least 3.6 million ounces or 111.6 metric tonnes. View of sand spit and Nome City 1903.

Mining claims could only be staked lawfully by citizens. Since natives were considered to be uncivilized, they could not get citizenship. For them, the gold rush meant a drastic reduction in moose, caribou, and small game as prospectors hunted these for food. In many areas, gold mining resulted in destruction of salmon streams. Contact with white men also had consequences like drinking and disease.Alaska Native Land Claims., retrieved 2011-12-21 Legacy Routes from Seattle to Nome, 1901 The original claim sites of the \\"Three Lucky Swedes\\" were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 (as \\"Anvil Creek Gold Discovery Site\\", \\"Erik Lindblom Placer Claim\\", and \\"Snow Creek Placer Claim No. 1\\"). In 1978, these three places, plus a fourth critical to the gold rush, were designated a National Historic Landmark District, Cape Nome Mining District Discovery Sites. The fourth site is a stretch of the beach on the eastern edge of the city, extending from the seawall to East Limit Road. and Nome and Klondike The legacy of the Nome gold rush is somewhat obscured by the fame of Klondike. The two gold rushes, however, should not be confused. Both Klondike and Nome are often thought of as Alaska gold rushes, even though only Nome is actually in Alaska. The center of the Klondike gold rush was near Dawson City in the Yukon Territory, Canada and therefore outside Alaska, but the two locations are connected by the Yukon River, which has its headwaters in northern British Columbia, Canada, and eventually flows through the Yukon Territory into Alaska. Klondike River giving name to the rush is a tributary of the Yukon River, which runs through Alaska and ends in Norton Sound opposite Nome. For that reason, Yukon River too is associated with both rushes. As mentioned earlier, there was an overlap of prospectors between Klondike and Nome and, finally, the two rushes shared some of the same routes. Film Apart from the novel and the films The Spoilers filmed in 1955 with Jeff Chandler, 1942 with John Wayne, 1930 with Gary Cooper, and 1914 with William Farnum, and also North to Alaska (1960 comedy, starring John Wayne as well and also known for its theme song) is set in Nome during the rush. In wyatt earp (1993 western based on the life of Wyatt Earp, starring Kevin Costner) a scene in the end refers briefly to Nome.

Jet Paul Rowland  On 28 February 2004, 22-month- old Jet Paul Rowland (born 9 April 2002) was killed when a driver with unstable epilepsy travelling in the opposite direction suffered a seizure, crossed the median strip on the Logan Motorway, south of Brisbane, and collided with the car Jet was travelling in with his mother Anita and his brother Bailey, aged 6. Anita Rowland, a police officer with the Queensland Police Service, sustained life-threatening injuries after the 200 km per hour impact. Bailey's spinal cord was severed, causing instant paraplegia. Jet later died at Brisbane's Mater Children's Hospital on the night of 28 February due to massive internal injuries after life support had to be withdrawn. The case highlighted and demonstrated the importance of managing any potentially unstable medical condition and the Coroner's Inquest, held on 25‚Äì26 August 2005, revealed that the driver who collided with the Rowland's vehicle had been experiencing 'frequent seizures' and therefore should not have been driving. 'The most telling question and answer in the inquest was when the driver was asked; 'You would not want to be driving while you had a simple partial seizure at one hundred kilometres per hour, would you?' The driver responded 'No'.Office of the State Coroner, 8 page 120, line 53-54 The State Coroner recommended the following actions be taken: 1\\\\. Review of practices concerning the forwarding of discharge summaries from hospitals in Queensland (both public and private) to ensure uniform consistent practice in forwarding a patient's discharge summary to the patient's general practitioner. 2\\\\. Review of legislation to require any doctor becoming aware of a patient suffering any epileptic event which would, in that doctor's opinion adversely impact on the patient's ability to safely drive a motor vehicle, to specifically discuss the issue with the patient at the consultation. The legislation should require the doctor to; (i) advise the patient if the doctor considers it inappropriate to continue to drive, (ii) set a period of time and/or refer the patient to an appropriate specialist for further management and advice concerning suitability to drive. (iii) provide written confirmation of the doctor's advice to the patient. 3\\\\. Review of legislation to consider whether and in what circumstances a driver, and/or a treating doctor should be required to inform the Transport Department of a medical condition (such as epilepsy) or a change in the medical condition of a person impacting on their ability to safely drive. Consideration of whether sanctions should apply against a driver and/or a treating medical officer if they fail to report relevant information. 4\\\\. Review of legislation (after consultation with relevant interest groups) to consider a panel of independent doctors available to accept referrals for assessment of suitability to drive in the context of epilepsy. The panel would be available to review a driver's eligibility to drive and to inform the Department of Transport accordingly. 5\\\\. Initiative by the Department of Transport or other appropriate agency or authority to publicise both to the public and the medical profession the Guidelines for Fitness to Drive. Emphasis should be given to a responsibility to review a person's fitness to drive in circumstances where there is any alteration in the person's medical condition likely to impact on their ability to safely drive a motor vehicle. 6\\\\. Review of current Australian standards of child safety restraint mechanisms taking into consideration world best practice standards, despite Jet having been restrained properly.  Anita Rowland  Anita Rowland lobbied the Queensland government for more stringent guidelines regarding medical conditions and driving. In 2008, new legislation was passed and 'Jet's Law' was created: whereby if a driver has a medical condition which may affect their ability to drive safely, they must declare it to the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads, as well as to their relevant health professional (doctor, physiotherapist, occupational therapist). Should there be a deterioration or a change in a person's medical condition, it must be reported and a medical certificate issued to indicate that the person is fit to drive. Following Jet's death, Anita returned to the police service and began facilitating road safety workshops with the Queensland Police Service as well as the Australian Defence Forces and Queensland Rail to make drivers aware of their duty of care. Through these workshops, it is estimated that Anita has shared her story with at least 10,000 people. While Anita left the service in 2013, her husband continues to work for the Queensland Police Service.

History In 1914, four years after the Scouting Movement was launched in the United States, the Allegheny County Council was chartered by the Boy Scouts of America. The Philadelphia Council was also chartered in 1914. In 1921 the council was split into seven separate council units: the Allegheny Council, Allegheny Valley Council, Chartiers Council (McKees Rocks), East Boroughs Council (Wilkinsburg; merged with Mon- Yough Council in 1973), Guyasuta Council (Aspinwall), Ohio Valley Council, Pittsburgh Council, and South Hills Council (merged with Pittsburgh Council, 1928, to become Allegheny County Council, West). In 1967, the former Nemacolin Trails Council in Washington, Pennsylvania, merged with the Allegheny Council in Pittsburgh to become the Allegheny Trails Council. This council merged again in 1993 with East Valley Area Council Forest Hills to become the former Greater Pittsburgh Council. Greater Pittsburgh Council and Penn's Woods Council merged on July 1, 2011 to form Laurel Highlands Council. Potomac Council was absorbed into Laurel Highlands Council in early 2014. Allegheny County Council Allegheny Council Allegheny Valley Council Chartiers Council East Boroughs Council Mon-Yough Council Guyasuta Council Ohio Valley Council East Valley Area Council Pittsburgh Council South Hills Council Allegheny County Council, West Nemacolin Trails Council Allegheny Trails Council Allegheny Trails Council was around from 1967-1992.

Anawanna offers some weekend cabins and tent camping.http://www.lhc- bsa.org/Camping/Camping%20Facilities/Camp%20Anawanna Camp Baker Camp Guyasuta Camp Guyasuta, located in Allegheny County (Pa.) between Aspinwall and Sharpsburg near the banks of the Allegheny River, was established in 1918. Mary Darlington, great-granddaughter of James O'Hara, lived in a house (named \\"Guyasuta\\") on the land at the time but was forced to vacate the property during World War I when the Federal government took over the railroad lines as part of the war effort. While the government acquired the land it needed, Mary subsequently gave the Boy Scouts over 100 additional acres suitable for a camp. When she died in 1925, Mary's will officially bequeathed the land to the Scouting organization. Heritage Reservation Heritage Reservation is located in Farmington, Pennsylvania,http://www.heritagereservation.org/resources/index.php#Maps Heritage opened in 1980 and is located in southwestern Pennsylvania. Heritage Reservation's primary season is summer, however it does offer other camping options throughout the year. Camps The reservation consists of four camps: * Camp Independence‚Äî Cub Scout camp * Eagle Base‚Äî Boy Scout and Venturing High Adventure camp * Camp Liberty‚Äî Boy Scout camp * Camp Freedom‚Äî Boy Scout camp Camp Liberty is functionally a more troop-centric model of camping, as all meals are prepared by the patrols. Camp Freedom and Independence are functionally more camp-centric models, as all meals and many events are centralized within the camp. All four camps offer various activities and merit badge opportunities that vary based on age appropriateness, Scout Rank and weather. Summer Activities Boy Scouts Cub Scouts Webelos Scouts Winter Activities Camp Potomac Camp Potomac is a rustic 114-acre Boy Scout Resident Camp located in Oldtown, Maryland, operated by the Laurel Highlands Council, Boy Scouts of America. There are three cabins and eight campsites available for camping. It was founded in 1951. Camp Potomac is perfectly located to provide a base camp for trips to Green Ridge State Forest, the C&O; Canal Towpath, the Potomac River, as well as a huge number of other attractions in the Western Maryland, Potomac Highlands of West Virginia, and Southwestern Pennsylvania areas. Camp Seph Mack Camp Seph Mack is located on Yellow Creek Lake near Penn Run, PA, and is one of the council camps of the Laurel Highlands Council, Boy Scouts of America. Laurel Highlands, BSA, is headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA, and serves approximately 30,000 youth and their families from an twelve-county area in south western Pennsylvania. Camp Seph Mack encompasses approximately 200 acres within the boundaries of Yellow Creek State Park and lies along the north shore with of almost 4,000 feet of lake frontage. Camp Seph Mack takes its name from the late J. Sephus Mack of Indiana, the patriarch of the family that originally donated much of this land for youth activities in the 1930s. The William Penn Council, a predecessor to Laurel Highlands, first operated Seph Mack as a Boy Scout Camp in the late 1940s. The camp ceased operation in the late 1960s and was sold to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as part of the development of Yellow Creek State Park. An organization titled William Penn Inc. was created to administer the investments made with the proceeds of that sale. In 1970, William Penn, Admiral Peary and Blair-Bedford Councils were merged to form Penn's Woods Council. In 1980, Penn's Woods Council reacquired the camp through a long-term lease agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Parks and the Department of Environmental Resources. In 2011 the Penn's Wood Council merged with the Greater Pittsburgh Council to form the Laurel Highlands Council. Today, William Penn Inc. is a major contributor to Laurel Highlands Council, providing donations from its investment income as seed money for capital improvement projects. In 1999 and 2000, with the support of William Penn Inc., a first-rate shower facility was constructed at Seph Mack for the use of the campers and guests of Laurel Highlands Council. Camp Seph Mack has seen many changes, and additions, over its storied history. Although the camp is open year round for camping and adventure, it is most popular for its summer camp programs. Seph Mack will host more than 1,000 Scouts during the summer in a variety of programs for youth of all ages, from the Cub Scout Day Camp program in mid-June, through the Boy Scout Resident program of late June to early August, and Webelos/Cub Resident Camp the week after. All of the programs are planned and supervised by a Nationally Accredited Camp Staff and provide age-appropriate activities. The Boy Scout and Webelos/Cub Summer Camps feature traditional camping programs. Sleeping in tents or under the stars, evening campfires and meals in the dining hall comprise the core of the camping experience. But beyond that, the Laurel Highlands Council has worked hard to upgrade and modernize Seph Mack, its facilities and programs, consistent with the interests and the demands of our area‚Äôs youth. In addition to the new shower house, the dining hall has been enlarged to provide for an ever-growing number of campers. Camp Seph Mack is particularly proud of a waterfront and aquatics program. No other Boy Scout camp in the northeast comes close. The waterfront and aquatic area was regraded and improved when the State drew down the water level of the Lake during the winter of 1999-2000. Through a generous contribution of a Scouting supporter, Laurel Highlands was able to purchase a large pontoon boat, christened the Jolly Roger in honor of our benefactor, which can be used for teaching power boat safety or for taking groups of Scouts to new and different fishing spots around the Lake. Sailboats, rowboats, canoes and kayaks are an integral part of our waterfront. Swimming, snorkeling and lifesaving are just a few of the other activities that are offered on what might be the best waterfront area in the northeast. Few other Scout camps can boast a 600-acre lake for its aquatic program. Traditional advancement programs are available throughout the camping season. Additionally, Sprint Troop, a specialized program for Scouts working on Second and First Class ranks, is available to usually first year scouts. Camp Seph Mack provides opportunities for lots of merit badges; camping, hiking, wilderness survival, nature, fishing and the shooting sports are available. Seph Mack has programs in astronomy and space exploration, canoeing and small boat sailing, athletics, and handicrafts of all kinds. Camp Seph Mack also serves as a training facility for adult leaders during the summer season. Training for adult leaders in Health and Safety, Youth Protection, Troop Leadership, Safety Afloat and a number of other topics is made available so that our adults can provide a better year-round program for the youth. But, Camp Seph Mack is open to more than just Scouting groups. In the past few years, Seph Mack has hosted Native American Festivals, SCUBA training programs, fishing and boating clubs, business meetings, military units and family reunions. The camp‚Äôs various facilities may be rented or donated, depending on the nature of the event and the length of each program. The Council has made a number of capital improvements to Camp Seph Mack over the past three years. The Council‚Äôs strategic vision will continue the building projects over the next 5‚Äì10 years. Camp Twin Echo Camp Twin Echo is a scout camp near Ligoner, PA and is a camp that is owned by the Laurel Highlands Council. One of the many of the program's housed there is the NYLT Twin Arrow training course and the Advancement Camp merit badge course. Camp Twin Echo was sold in the winter/spring of 2019 and is no longer being used as a scout camp. Order of the Arrow The Order of the Arrow is represented by the Allohak Menewi Lodge. It supports the Scouting programs of the council through leadership, camping, and service.

The Nilachala is a place of high religious significance in Hinduism and is one of the four Char Dhams. Religious teachers like Shri Ramanuja Acharya, Swami Vishnuswami visited Nilachala in the Twelfth century and established a mathas. Shri Nimbarka Acharya also visited Puri, as also Guru Nanak Dev and many other Acharyas. Shri Chaitanya spent 18 years at Nilachal dhama. As per religious texts and the Skanda Purana, mythical King Indradyumna of Avanti once dreamt of the great deity Nila Madhava (Blue Madhava) being worshipped at the Nilachal mount. The King sent out many priests and messengers in the search of the elusive deity Nila Madhava. Finally, Vidyapati, one of the priests of King Indradyumna located Nilachala as well as Nila Madhava at the Purusottam Kshetra (The land of the Supreme Being) and took the news back to the King. However, as per divine designs, the Nila Madhava deity vanished before Indradyumna could undertake darshan. But, subsequently, propitiated, the God appeared as Jagannath at Nilachal. Geographically, though, there is no such apparent geographic structure at Puri, the township being located at the coastal plains of Eastern Odisha. Such a reference to a seemingly non-existent mountain has been a matter of debate which throws light on the origin of the deity. Hypotheses regarding existence of the Blue Mountain Hypothesis 1 Indologist and Jagannath cult researcher, Heinrich von Stietencron in \\"The Advent of Vishnuism in Orissa: An Outline of its History According to Archaeological and Epigraphical Sources from the Gupta Period up to 1135 AD.\\" in A. Eschmann et al., The Cult of Jagannath and the Regional Tradition of Orissa, Delhi: Manohar, pp. 1‚Äì30, hypothesizes the actual existence of a mountain at Puri in the past and notes the following: > Yet contrary to such opinion, the platform of the Jagannath temple, seems to > be a totally man-made monument, not a modified natural hill. The Nilachala > consists almost entirely of a platform, and at its north‚Äîwestern foot lies > an artificial cave. This is approximately 25 feet below the level of the > inner enclosure, for a staircase of about twenty two steps leads down to the > sanctum of deity Patalesvara Shiva, and gives some idea of the level of the > original terrain. The site was obviously exposed to flooding during the > monsoon season as once the river touched its lowest steps when it flowed in > the broad road just in front of the temp Hypothesis 2 Another > hypothesis regarding the naming of Puri as 'Nilachala' has been advanced by > the noted historian, Dr. Krushna Chandra Panigrahi, in his \\"History of > Orissa\\", pp. 338‚Äì339. It has been argued that no mountain existed at the > Jagannath shrine, and: > \\"\\"Then the Bhaumas came from Assam in the first part of the eighth century > A.D., ruled over Orissa, obtained the shrine from the Savaras, got the > temple built on the spot and gave it the name Nilachala, which was the name > of the famous shrine of Kamakhya in their homeland of Assam.\\".\\" In the 19th century, certain scholars have imagined that the Nilachala (Blue Hill) concealed the debris of a former Buddhist monument named Dantapura. However, Puri cannot be identified with Dantapura and so far no Buddhist remains have been discovered there.

The road to supply the Piave front was built in only three months. Due to its short construction period, it is nicknamed the \\"Road of 100 Days.\\" Prisoners of war, the elderly, women, and children of the local population were pressed into service to build it.

The team successfully acquire the phone from CIA director Friedkin (Wayne Knight), through which Friedkin received mysterious orders to exterminate Torchwood. The team follow leads and uncover a stockpile of painkillers at the pharmaceutical corporation PhiCorp, indicating they knew the Miracle was going to happen. At a loose end, Jack (John Barrowman) takes the night off and picks up a man in a bar, and Rex seeks solace in his surgeon, Vera Juarez (Arlene Tur). Juarez tells Rex that PhiCorp representative Jilly Kitzinger (Lauren Ambrose) has invited her along to an important meeting tomorrow; Rex recruits Juarez to listen in for Torchwood, while Gwen (Eve Myles) goes on a mission with the special Torchwood contact lenses and steals information from Kitzinger's computer. The meeting turns out to be a seminar, where Congressman Morganthall announces plans to make painkillers legal to purchase without prescription. At Torchwood HQ, Rex and Esther receive a mysterious phone call from Friedkin's anonymous superiors and figuring their base has been compromised, realise that Torchwood must now leave D.C. Released murderer Oswald Danes (Bill Pullman) struggles to fit into the real world, and after being assaulted by police officers accepts Kitzinger's earlier offer of representation. He attends a select board meeting at PhiCorp. PhiCorp award him personal security on the condition he promotes their new painkiller legislation on national television to his growing following. Suspicious of Danes, Jack confronts him at the TV station. Jack gets Danes to admit that he does not feel forgiveness, but also that he enjoyed the rape and murder of his 12-year-old victim; Jack realises from this speech that Danes has a death wish that is being denied him. Danes' security assaults Jack and releases him onto the streets just as Danes tells the world about the need for PhiCorp's painkiller legislation. Sex scene broadcast differences \\"Dead of Night\\" features concurrent gay and straight sex scenes; the straight sex scene features Rex and Vera (Mekhi Phifer and Arlene Tur), and the gay scene features John Barrowman and guest actor Dillon Casey, playing bartender Brad. Gay men's website AfterElton.com enthusiastically reported on Casey's casting in March; the casting side for Brad, released in December 2010, had assuaged fears that Jack would be \\"de-gayed\\" by American network Starz. Barrowman later told Access Hollywood reporters that the gay sex scene the series would feature would be more explicit than previous shots of its kind in Torchwood, because Starz as a US premium cable network allowed the show to \\"push the envelope a little bit more\\". For airings in the UK, the BBC (a public broadcast network) edited the scene because it was deemed inappropriate for the primetime slot. However, a BBC spokesperson stated that the edit would not affect the story in any way. Barrowman however, responded by saying that sex scenes in the show were not gratuitous, and did form a part of the plot. Reception The A.V. Club's Zack Handlen awarded \\"Dead of Night\\" a B- rating. He felt that the episode did not have any truly tense scenes compared to previous episode \\"Rendition\\". While he celebrated that the \\"two-fer sex scene\\" was unusual for mainstream science fiction, Handlen felt it \\"didn't make for gripping television\\", and felt Jack's hook-up was at least more believable than the prospect of a Rex/Vera romance. Though he gave the episode a relatively high rating, and was optimistic for Miracle Day as a series, Handlen's concluding paragraph stated \\"an episode like this isn't a good sign\\". Los Angeles Times reviewer Emily VanDerWerff wrote \\"With every week it‚Äôs on the air, Torchwood: Miracle Day continues to expand its scope\\"; her review was largely positive but marked with criticisms. She felt \\"the episode's mid-section was where it was flabbiest\\", referring to Gwen's contact with Rhys and the lovemaking scenes. Like Handlen, she remarked on the believability of the Rex/Vera pairing, saying \\"It made sense for later in the episode that Rex and Vera had hooked up (since it gave her stronger motivation to work with Torchwood), but in the moment, it seemed ludicrously convenient.\\" Like Handlen, VanDerWerff didn't find the American public's reaction to Danes believable either. However, her summary said \\"All in all, this was a \\"putting the pieces in place\\" kind of episode, and though some of the pieces were moved quite inelegantly‚Äîagain, the Rex and Vera hook-up‚Äîmuch of whether this episode stands out as the start of a decline or a brief hiccup will be determined by where the pieces go from here.\\" Assignment X gave the episode a positive review, stating \\"Although there‚Äôs certainly plenty here for new viewers to enjoy, there‚Äôs such a richness of character development for old fans to appreciate.\\"http://www.assignmentx.com/2011/tv-review-torchwood-miracle-day- dead-of-night-review-1/ WhatCulture! gave the episode 5 stars, praising it as \\"easily the best episode of the series thus far\\", with \\"plenty of character development\\" and plot momentum, which bodes well for Starz' Miracle Day investment. Den of Geek gave the episode a positive review, praising Espenson's script for having \\"fun with the cultural differences\\" in the Torchwood team, and for the development of friction around Rex. The reviewer praised the use of \\"old fashioned Torchwood technology\\" from past seasons, and praised the episode on a whole for showing \\" what Torchwood continues to do extremely well, namely, the slower moments, where very good characters are put in extraordinary situations. It sounds a very simple thing to praise Miracle Day for, but it's something that many, many shows get wrong.\\"http://www.denofgeek.com/television/995763/torchwood_miracle_day_episode_3_review_dead_of_night.html In The United Kingdom the consolidated ratings reveal that 5.49 million viewers watched this episode, making it the 8th most popular of the week. Between broadcast on the 28th and the end of July the programme had amassed a further 410,000 viewers on the UK catch up service iPlayer.

Career and City Slickers scandal Between 1998 and 2000, along with his colleague, Anil Bhoyrul, Hipwell worked on the Daily Mirror's financial column City Slickers, offering financial news, gossip and share tips. It became very popular, a Guardian article describing it as the \\"Column that turns City into showbiz\\". However, in February 2000 the pair were fired following allegations that they had been giving tips about companies in which they held stock. The Department of Trade and Industry launched an investigation in 2000 but it did not conclude for several years and the trial did not come to court until October 2005. In 2002 Hipwell gave an interview to The Guardian in which he described the situation as \\"Kafkaesque\\". \\"We are in the invidious position of everyone knowing that we are under investigation by the DTI yet nobody, including us, knows exactly what the scope of the investigation is, who they are talking to, what they are minded to do or when, if at all, there will be an outcome,\\" he said. On 7 December 2005, following a six-week trial, Hipwell and Bhoyrul were convicted of conspiracy to contravene section 47(2) of the Financial Services Act 1986 contrary to section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977. Daily Mirror whistleblower In July 2011, following allegations about phone hacking at the News of the World and other News International titles, an interview that Hipwell gave to The Guardian in 2006 about hacking at The Mirror while he was there was unearthed by blogger Paul Staines. Hipwell spoke to The Independent claiming that the practice had been \\"endemic\\" at the Mirror during his time there under the editorship of Piers Morgan. He also alleged that phone hacking took place at some of the Mirror's sister publications. Trinity Mirror, which publishes the Daily Mirror, contested Hipwell's claims. A spokesman said: \\"Our position is clear...Our journalists work within the criminal law and the Press Complaints Commission code of conduct.\\" Following Hipwell's allegations the share price of Trinity Mirror dropped 10 per cent and the company was forced to announce a review into whether its journalists had in the past hacked telephones. In an interview for the BBC's World at One programme on 28 July 2011 Hipwell said there was \\"no doubt\\" that Piers Morgan knew that his journalists were using phone hacks as a method to get stories. In another interview with the BBC's Newsnight he said that phone hacking had been an \\"accepted technique\\" to get a story at the Daily Mirror while he worked there. On 21 December 2011 Hipwell appeared before the Leveson Inquiry and told the hearing that he had witnessed several incidents in which people's privacy was infringed while working for the Mirror, and that phone hacking appeared to be a \\"bog-standard journalistic tool\\" for gathering information at the paper. In the official report, Lord Justice Leveson said Hipwell's account of phone hacking at the Mirror was \\"clear, firm and convincing\\", while Piers Morgan's assertion that he had no knowledge of alleged phone hacking was described as \\"utterly unpersuasive\\". Max Clifford Associates Subsequent to working for the Daily Mirror, Hipwell worked for Max Clifford at Max Clifford Associates. Personal life In 2000 Hipwell was struck down with kidney failure and had to start having dialysis three times a week at the Middlesex Hospital in London. His brother, Tom Hipwell, donated a kidney in 2002 but the underlying kidney disease, IgA nephropathy, returned and he was back on dialysis in 2010. He has written extensively about the experience in a blog called \\"Life on the waiting list\\" in The Guardian. In September 2010 he had a second kidney transplant, this time with his wife, film-maker and journalist Rachel Stevenson, acting as donor. She made a film about their journey to the operating table for The Guardian. On 14 April 2011 the pair appeared on ITV morning programme Lorraine to talk about the experience and to highlight the importance of joining the NHS Organ Donor Register. Since first being diagnosed with kidney failure, Hipwell has campaigned on related issues such as organ donation and presumed consent. In 2002 he launched National Transplant Awareness Week with health minister David Lammy. They unveiled a billboard encouraging the public to register to become organ donors. He has also written articles in support of a campaign by The Observer to change the system of organ donation to one of presumed consent, in line with other European countries such as Spain, Austria and Belgium.

He was ambassador of the king of Portugal to several popes, and papal ambassador to the Emperor and others. Sometimes referred to through antonomasia as the Cardinal of Viseu (), he was Bishop of Viseu (Portugal), and Apostolic Administrator of the diocese of Massa Maritima (Tuscany). He was a cardinal of the Holy Roman Church from 1539 to 1556, and served as governor of several papal states. Education and career Silva was educated at the University of Paris, then in Siena, then Bologna, and finally in Rome. After his stay in Rome, he travelled to Venice, and from there he returned to Portugal, visiting several European principalities along the way.Cardella, p. 234. On his return to Portugal in 1502, he was appointed escriv√£o da puridade, or keeper of the royal seal, to the eldest son of King Manuel I, who succeeded him as John III of Portugal.Susannah Humble Ferreira, \\"Inventing the Courtier in early Sixteenth-Century Portugal,\\" in: He was appointed by King Manuel I of Portugal as ambassador to Rome in 1514. He served in that post during the reigns of popes Leo X, Adrian VI and Clement VII. Both Leo X and Clement VII wanted to make him a Cardinal, but were opposed by the Portuguese Crown. He was recalled to Lisbon in 1525 where he served as member of the Royal Council. Pope Clement VII appointed him Bishop of Viseu on 21 November 1526. He resigned the see on 22 April 1547, in favor of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, the grandson of Pope Paul III.Eubel, p. 335. Pope Paul III finally elevated Miguel da Silva to the cardinalate on 19 December 1539, though the appointment was kept secret (in pectore) for the time being.Eubel, p. 27 no. 39. Seniority in the College of Cardinals is measured from the date of appointment, not the date of publication. Falling out of favour with King John III of Portugal, D. Miguel da Silva ran away to Rome in 1540, where he was warmly welcomed to the Curia by Paul III. His status as a Cardinal was revealed in 1541, and on 6 February 1542 he was assigned the titular church of Ss. XII Apostolorum.Eubel, p. 27 note 9. King John III of Portugal promptly condemned him on a charge of treason and revoked his Portuguese nationality. On 30 August 1542, Silva was named Legate to the Emperor Charles V.Eubel, p. 27, note 10. On 9 January 1545, he was appointed Legate of the Marches of Ancona, and on 19 March 1545 was also named governor of Fermo.Eubel, p. 27, note 11. He served as papal legate to Venice and Bologna. On 20 May 1549, he was named Apostolic Administrator of the diocese of Massa Marittima by Pope Paul III. Eubel, p. 237. Silva took part in the papal conclave following the death of Paul III, which began on 29 November 1549 and concluded on 7 February 1550 with the election of Cardinal Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte, who took the name Julius III.Eubel, p. 31, with note 1. He also took part in the conclave following the death of Julius III, which began on 5 April 1555 and ended on 9 April 1555, with the election of Cardinal Marcello Cervini, who took the name Marcellus II. He died three weeks later, on 30 April.Eubel, p. 33, with note 1. A conclave followed immediately, opening on 15 May 1555 and concluding on 23 May with the election of Giampetro Carafa (Paul IV).Eubel, p. 34, with note 1. Silva died in Rome on 5 June 1556, and was buried in the church of S. Maria in Trastevere, which had been his titular church since 11 December 1553.Chac√≥n, pp. 675-676. Greatly praised for his classical culture and command of ancient languages, he was a personal friend of the painter Raffaello Sanzio.

It includes detailed data on the identification of very young fish and the rearing of fish species important for fisheries and aquaculture. , it included descriptions of 2,228 species, 4,229 pictures, and references to 4,513 works in the scientific literature.According to the LarvalBase web page, accessed 21 July 2011 The database is under the supervision of Bernd Ueberschaer at the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Kiel, Germany. LarvalBase is an offshoot of, and follows the same format as FishBase, a comprehensive online database about finfish. Whereas FishBase is a database about adult finfish, LarvalBase is a database about the juvenile stages of fish. Juvenile fish often feed differently and occupy different habitats than the adults do. LarvalBase complements FishBase by providing information about these early stages of life. LarvalBase aims to include all the key data on finfish larvae, with an emphasis on standardising the data, making it easy to extract and combine data with other data, and offering powerful presentation tools. It draws on the traditional primary sources found in papers, books and reports, gray literature and unpublished but reliable data from sources such as practicing aquaculturists. The data includes information such as identification keys, morphometrics, broodstock, spawning and nursery behaviour, prey and predators, and growth stages and rates.LarvalBase: A Global Information System on Fish Larvae American Fisheries Society, Early Life History Section Newsletter, May 2002, 23(2): 7‚Äì9. It also includes information of specific interest to aquaculturists, such as how long it takes egg to hatch, diagrams charting changes in anatomy at different larval stages, analysis of larval diets, and techniques for rearing fish fry.Database: Fish Fry Science, 16 June 2006, 312(5780): 1577. Background It can be difficult for fisheries, aquaculture and hatchery scientists and managers to get the information they need on the species that concern them, because the relevant facts can be scattered and buried across numerous journal articles, reports, newsletters and other sources. It can be particularly difficult for people in developing countries who need such information. An answer to this situation is to consolidate all the available information, drawn from the global sources, into an easily accessed database. The database will be particularly useful if the data has also been standardised and validated.Palomares MLD and Bailly N (2011) \\"Organizing and disseminating marine biodiversity information: the Fishbase and SeaLifeBase story\\" Pages 24‚Äì46. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective, Cambridge University Press. .

He was the first to set up missions in the Kavango Region and in Ovamboland, became the first Vicar Apostolic of Windhoek. Early life and missionary work  Gotthardt was born in Thalheim in the German Westerwald. He attended the Oblate Congregation in the Limburg Province in the Netherlands from 1900 to 1905 and graduated as priest. He worked as Junior Lecturer directly after being ordained until 1907 and was then sent to Grootfontein in German South- West Africa. Soon after his arrival he in Namibia he led the sixth and seventh mission journeys to the Kavango region‚Äîa difficult assignment considering that the leader of the indigenous population, Hompa (King) Nyangana of the VaGciriku was a fierce critic of all European influence, and particularly that of missionaries. The previous five mission journeys into the Kavango had been unsuccessful but the seventh led to the establishment of a mission station at Nyangana in 1910 and at Andara in 1913. Gotthardt also developed the first mission station in former Ovamboland, at Oshikuku, in 1924. Church career Gotthardt was appointed Prefect Apostolic of Cimbebasia in 1921, replacing the retired Eugenio Klaeyle. When the prefecture became the Windhoek Vicariate soon thereafter, he became Vicar and was ordained as Bishop at H√ºnfeld in Germany in 1924, becoming the leader of the Catholic Church in South-West Africa. In 1923, he published a widely received paper The awakening of Africa and the duties of the Catholic church in which he portrayed the \\"unhappy entanglement\\" of colonisation and mission, one of the first pieces of criticism of colonisation in Namibia. After serving 25 years in the position of Vicar, Pope Pius XII appointed him as archbishop in 1951. After more than 50 years of service, Gotthardt resigned at the age of 80 in May 1961.

In July 2011, GE Lighting entered a licensing agreement with Nuventix for its LED cooling technology and invested $10 million into the company.GigaOm. \\"A Better Way to Cool LEDS Gets Attention from GE.\\" Two weeks later, the company announced its plans to buy Lightech, acquiring its LED and halogen power supplies, for a deal reportedly worth between $15 million and $20 million.https://gigaom.com/2011/07/25/ge-to- buy-led-tech-maker-lightech On October 7, 2015, the Commercial division of GE Lighting was separated from the business and a new startup, Current was created. On July 1, 2020, GE Lighting was acquired by Savant Systems, a home automation company.https://www.twice.com/product/product-spotlight/smart- home/savant-systems-inc-completes-acquisition-of-ge-lighting References See also * Chicago Lighting Institute External links * Category:American brands Category:Lighting brands Category:Electronics companies established in 1911 Category:American companies established in 1911 Category:Manufacturing companies based in Ohio Category:Former General Electric subsidiaries Category:East Cleveland, Ohio Category:2020 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"GE Lighting"},{"id":"32506593","text":"Dungeons of Dredmor is a roguelike indie game released on July 13, 2011 by Gaslamp Games. Downloadable content (DLC), \\"Realm of the Diggle Gods\\", was released later that year. A second DLC, \\"You Have To Name The Expansion Pack\\" was released on June 5, 2012. A third DLC, \\"Conquest of the Wizardlands\\" was released on August 1, 2012. The game has extensive support for user created modifications.http://www.gaslampgames.com/2011/12/12/patch-1-0-8-is-up-the- dlc-is-not/  Gameplay  Stat and Damage Types The game starts as the player assumes the role of the game's main character entering a hostile dungeon crawler environment. The player enters a dungeon at the top floor and gradually progresses down through levels of increasing difficulty. Each level is a randomly generated maze of interconnected rooms, filled with monsters, traps, loot, and various objects. The game world is laid out in a tile-based square grid viewed from a top-down perspective, where the player, enemies, and various items and objects occupy discrete squares. The game is turn-based, and both the player and numerous enemies take turns performing actions. Each turn the player may move to or attack monsters in adjacent squares, pick up, drop, and use items, and interact with various in-game objects. As in most role- playing games, the player has several character statistics that determine their effectiveness in various aspects of gameplay. The player begins the game with 7 chosen skills, which may be further improved as the player gains experience levels. The combat focuses on melee, ranged, and magic attacks, as well as use of items and skills. Weapons and equipment can be worn to improve the player's defences and abilities. The player carries an inventory of items, which can include various foods, drinks, potions, crafting materials, etc. Dungeons of Dredmor's in-game currency is zorkmids, a reference to Zork. Shops are also featured on every floor, where players may buy and sell equipment and consumables; however, stealing from a shop will result in the player being attacked by many powerful enemies. The objective of the game is ostensibly to find and slay the eponymous Lord Dredmor, the ruler of the dungeons. However, doing so is difficult, and per the developers' own admittance, the objective is more often to see how far one can get before dying, and then try again. The game features three levels of difficulty - Elvishly Easy, Dwarven Moderation, and Going Rogue, equivalent to Easy, Normal, and Hard, respectively. \\"No Time To Grind?\\" can be selected, which is an option for smaller floors, but offer the same amount of experience as normal levels. Character permadeath may be enabled or disabled during character creation. Artifacts are powerful weapons and armor that have a randomly-generated name and extra attributes compared to standard gear. Artifacts have the same appearance as normal gear but have bonus stats alongside the existing stats of the gear, i.e a Wooden Sword does two points of Crushing damage, but an artifact version may have additional added damage types as well. The player may obtain artifacts by discovering them in the dungeon, from the Lutefisk God, creating them using an Anvil of Krong, or as a reward from quests. Quests can be accepted from Statues of Inconsequentia, which assign the player the task of defeating a squad of monsters, retrieving an artifact, or delivering a retrieved artifact to a specific location in the dungeon. Lutefisk is frequently referenced in Dungeons of Dredmor, where lutefisk is a consumable item, and flavor text frequently mocks it and refers to it as being 'inedible'. Lutefisk may be sacrificed to the Lutefisk God, which may reward the player with artifacts.Dungeons of Dredmor (2011). Gaslamp Games. Gaslamp Games.  Development  In an interview with RPGWatch, game's artist David Baumgart explains that the game is based on an \\"immature build of a humorous roguelike game\\" that the game's programmer Nicholas Vining had been working on since 2006. He also notes that the game's art sets the game apart from traditional roguelikes that feature ASCII graphics.  Reception  Critics have generally given Dungeons of Dredmor high scores, and as of June 6, 2012 it holds a 79/100 score at Metacritic and 79.00% at GameRankings. Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun notes how the game's complexity and heavy reliance on the random aspect makes it unbalanced and unpredictable. He notes that careful strategy has to be employed; and ends that Dungeons of Dredmor is \\"genuinely, a fantastic game\\" albeit with minor interface issues. Jordan Baughman of GamesRadar calls it a \\"competent roguelike\\" and points out that it requires careful strategy. He notes that its humor sets it apart other roguelikes, but criticizes inventory management. Adam Biessener of Game Informer calls the game a \\"fun, accessible, lighthearted dungeon crawl\\". He notes that the game does not innovate outside the bounds of the genre, but manages to excel at certain aspects. He also remarks on the game's humor and level of detail. Nathan Meunier of IGN calls Dungeons of Dredmor challenging, but notes it is easy to get into with adjusted difficulty settings. He praises its humor and replayability. Jason Wilson of GamePro praises the simple starting setup and calls the combat \\"simple yet deep\\". While he sees the difficulty as a good feature, he also comments on balance issues. Josh McIllwain of Ars Technica notes that the game's \\"wicked sense of humor\\" sets it apart from other roguelike games. He also points out the difficulty and calls it \\"brutal and unforgiving\\".

In 2017, the BMI Latin Awards named him the Contemporary Latin Songwriter of the Year for his contribution in Latin music industry, and has won the first Global Icon Award given by Lo Nuestro Awards, in recognition of his contribution to spread Latin music worldwide. He became the first Latino to headline world-musical events such as Coachella, Tomorrowland, and Lollapalooza. The Guinness World Records acknowledged him as a \\"leader of a second-generation reggaeton\\". His breakthrough came in 2014 with \\"Ginza\\" and the single \\"6 AM\\" featuring Puerto Rican singer Farruko which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart following with \\"Ay Vamos\\" and \\"Ginza\\". In 2016, he released Energia, which included the hit singles \\"Ginza\\", \\"Bobo\\", \\"Safari\\", and \\"Sigo Extra√±√°ndote\\".

He has collaborated with Latin American artists such as Ozuna, Nicky Jam, Alejandro Sanz, Bad Bunny and Pitbull. Despite working with many English-speaking artists such as Beyonc√©, Pharrell Williams, The Black Eyed Peas, Cardi B, Dua Lipa and Major Lazer, J Balvin continues to sing almost exclusively in Spanish, and hopes to introduce Spanish-language music to a global audience. He is also noted for his eclectic and colorful fashion sense. J Balvin is included in Time magazine 's 100 Most Influential People of 2020. Life and career  1985‚Äì2013: Early life and career beginnings  J Balvin was born into a middle-class family in Medell√≠n, Colombia on May 7, 1985. His father was an economist and business owner, and he grew up in a large home in the hills outside the city. He grew up listening to rock groups such as Metallica and Nirvana, and states that he incorporates the grunge aesthetic into his personal style, having a Nirvana tattoo on his knee. He developed an interest in reggaeton after listening to Daddy Yankee. He recalls that \\"I was such a fan that I was copying his style, the way he moved onstage, his flows, his raps,\\" comparing him to the reggaeton equivalent of Jay-Z. His father's business went bankrupt, and the family lost their home and car, requiring the family to move to a poorer neighborhood. On this period of his life, J Balvin notes, \\"When I would go to the barrio, people saw me as a rich person, but when I‚Äôm around rich people they see me as someone from the ghetto. It‚Äôs all perceptions. I like moving between worlds. I feel equally comfortable in both.\\" When J Balvin was 16, he participated in an English-exchange program in Oklahoma, but was disappointed by the experience, saying, \\"I was expecting the U.S. that everyone knows from Hollywood.\\" Soon after the program, he moved to New York City to further study English and music, living with an aunt on Staten Island and working as a dog walker. During his time in New York, he became fascinated by the business savvy of New York rappers 50 Cent and P. Diddy. J Balvin worked various jobs in New York, Miami, and Medell√≠n, including working illegally in the United States as a roofer and house painter. He ultimately decided to return to Colombia and began performing at various urban clubs in Medell√≠n and increasing his social media following. He enrolled at the prestigious EAFIT University in Medell√≠n for seven semesters, studying international business. At age 19, he began to seriously pursue a career in music and adopted the stage name J Balvin \\"El Negocio\\", meaning \\"The Business\\" in English. He met his DJ and business partner David Rivera Mazo in a freestyle battle on the street in Medell√≠n. The two became fast friends and started producing and promoting their own music without a record label. J Balvin's early songs were described as \\"basically poor imitations of commercial reggaeton from Puerto Rico,\\" but he soon adopted a more relaxed, minimalist style in his music. He signed to EMI Colombia in 2009 and soon after released the single \\"Ella Me Cautiv√≥,\\" which charted at number 35 on the Billboard Tropical Songs chart. He released his debut album, Real, in 2009. In 2012, J Balvin released a mixtape featuring many of his early hits in Colombia, including \\"En Lo Oscuro\\" and \\"Como un Animal.\\" His first international hit was the one-night-stand-themed \\"Yo Te Lo Dije\\", and signed with Universal subsidiary Capitol Latin a year later.  2014‚Äì16: \\"6AM\\" success and La Familia  J Balvin in June 2014 In February 2014, J Balvin released a new track entitled \\"6 AM,\\" featuring Puerto Rican singer Farruko. J Balvin described the lyrical content of the song as the \\"Latin version of The Hangover,\\" where the two singers attempt to remember what happened during a night of partying. The song debuted at number 43 on the Billboard Latin Airplay chart in February and reached number one in May. His album La Familia reached number ten on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart, spending 122 weeks on the chart in total. Shortly after, J Balvin released his second track in the United States, \\"Ay Vamos,\\" which solidified his mark in the Latin urban market. It won a Latin Grammy Award for Best Urban Song. This was a bonus track on the deluxe edition of J Balvin's album La Familia B-Sides The music video is one of the most watched Latin music videos of all time, at over one billion views. The song went to number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in 2015. The remix, featuring Nicky Jam and French Montana was used in the soundtrack to the film Furious 7. J Balvin performed the track at the 2015 Premios Lo Nuestro and the Billboard Latin Music Awards. J Balvin has been featured on remixes of \\"Sorry\\" by Justin Bieber, \\"The Way\\" and \\"Problem\\" by Ariana Grande, \\"Blurred Lines\\" by Robin Thicke, \\"Maps\\" by Maroon 5, and \\"Stuck on a Feeling\\" by Prince Royce. J Balvin was the first Colombian singer to record with \\"The Prince of Bachata\\" and establishing itself as an international artist. J Balvin swept the urban category at the 2015 Premios Lo Nuestro, including \\"Urban Artist of the Year,\\" \\"Urban Album of the Year,\\" \\"Urban Song of the Year\\" and \\"Urban Collaboration of the Year.\\" On February 12, the nominees for the Billboard Latin Music Awards were announced, and J Balvin was nominated 13 times, of these nominations, eight were in the same category twice \\"Ay Vamos\\" and \\"6 AM,\\" being the most nominated Colombian and the first urban artist from Colombia. J Balvin won New Artist, Latin Rhythm Song of the Year, and Latin Rhythm Song Artist of the Year, where he dedicated the award to his home country of Colombia. In June 2015, it was announced that J Balvin had cancelled his performance on Miss USA 2015 to protest Donald Trump's inflammatory comments insulting illegal immigrants, saying, \\"During [Trump's] presidential campaign kickoff speech last week [June 2015], Trump accused illegal immigrants of bringing drugs, crime and rapists to the U.S.\\" His live performance had been scheduled for July 12, 2015 in Louisiana, which would have been J Balvin's first performance on national mainstream television.  2016‚Äì17: Energia  J Balvin performing \\"Sigo Extra√±√°ndote\\" in Chile in March 2017 On January 16, 2016, J Balvin premiered his new single \\"Ginza\\" from his upcoming album, at the Premios Juventud.

J Balvin became the first artist to receive a diamond certification in the Latin field from the Recording Industry Association of America, denoting digital sales of 600,000 units for his songs \\"6 AM\\" and \\"Ay Vamos.\\" Andrew Casillas of Rolling Stone wrote that \\"with its deliciously liquid beat, [\\"Ginza\\"] among the finest three minutes in reggaet√≥n history.\\" On June 24, 2016, J Balvin released his third studio album Energia. Energia debuted at number one on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart, signifying his first time topping that chart. It had the third-best debut sales of any Latin artist in 2016, after Juan Gabriel's Los Duo 2 and Banda Sinaloense MS de Sergio Lizarraga's Que Bendicion. It also debuted at number 38 on the all-genre Billboard 200. The album featured collaborations with Daddy Yankee, Juanes, Pharrell, and Yandel. He launched 3 hit singles from the album, \\"Bobo,\\" \\"Safari,\\" and \\"Sigo Extranandote,\\" which all reached the top 10 of the Latin charts. \\"Bobo\\" spent a week at the top of the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. Mario Prunes of Allmusic described Energia as \\"an album that knew it was going to be an international blockbuster almost a year before its release,\\" due to the success of \\"Ginza\\". Rolling Stone ranked the album number four on the magazine's list of the 10 Best Latin Albums of 2016. In promotion of the album, J Balvin embarked on the Energia Tour, traveling with several special guests including French Montana, Zion & Lennox, Bad Bunny, and Steve Aoki, the latter of which appeared as a surprise for fans during the last stop of the tour in Miami. That same year, J Balvin featured on \\"Cuando Seas Grande\\" by Spanish musician Alejandro Sanz and American singer Sofia Carson¬¥s \\"Love is the Name.\\" He launched a partnership with SoundCloud and Buchanan's Whiskey in a project called Es Nuestro Momento, where fans can access J Balvin's previously unreleased a capella vocals and create personalized remixes of his songs.

Vibras claimed the record for the most-streamed Latin album in 24 hours on the streaming platform for 2018. In the United States, it debuted at number one on the Top Latin Albums chart for the issue dated 9 June 2018. According to Nielsen Music, the record sold 22,000 album-equivalent units and became Balvin's second number-one album on the chart, following Energia in 2016. Additionally, Vibras scored the largest streaming week ever for a Latin album by an artist; its songs were streamed 16.1 million times. Subsequently, it debuted at number 15 on the US Billboard 200 and became his highest- charting album on the chart. In an interview with Ebro Darden for Beats 1 Radio on Apple Music in April 2018, Balvin described the sound of the record as 33% dancehall, 33% R&B;, and 33% reggaeton. Balvin further elaborated that much love was put into the album's work and that contains different vibes, hence the name, Vibras, \\"The real meaning of this album was what's going on with Spanish music that's going so global, the fact that we did an album that the beats are so amazing that you don't have to understand what we say, you just have to love the songs.\\"  2019‚Äìpresent: Oasis and Colores On June 27, 2019, J Balvin released his new album in collaboration with Bad Bunny titled Oasis. The record was released overnight and was deemed a \\"surprise\\" release. The two artists first met at a J Balvin concert in Puerto Rico, when Bad Bunny was working on releasing music on SoundCloud, and then collaborated on the 2017 track \\"Si Tu Novio Te Deja Sola\\". The chemistry between the two was so strong that they came up with the idea to release a joint album. Oasis peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200, and topped the Billboard US Latin Albums chart. The album was nominated for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album at the 2020 Grammy Awards and was named one of Rolling Stone‚Äòs Best Latin Albums of 2019.

The concert series consisted of two performances in Texas, one in Dallas and one in Houston, and featured openers Wisin y Yandel, Reik, Sech, Ozuna, Natti Natasha, Pedro Capo, Sebastian Yatra, Tito El Bambino. J Balvin's collaboration with Spanish singer Rosal√≠a \\"Con altura\\" won Best Urban Song at the 2019 Latin Grammy Awards. The song received positive reviews from critics and Billboard ranked it 5th on their list of 100 Best Songs of 2019. J Balvin was a guest performer in the Super Bowl LIV halftime show headlined by Jennifer Lopez and Shakira. He also collaborated with Major Lazer and Dominican dembow singer El Alfa on the single \\"Que Calor\\" in September 2019. In November 2019, J Balvin released the music video for the single \\"Blanco\\", which introduced a \\"futuristic, all-white environment filled with hypnotic dancers and flying cats\\". On March 20, 2020, J Balvin released the album Colores, in which every song is named after a color except the song \\"Arco√≠ris\\" (the Spanish word for rainbow). The album contains influences from dancehall, R&B;, and electronica, and features Nigerian afrobeats artist Mr Eazi on the song \\"Arco√≠ris\\". Suzy Exposito of Rolling Stone called the album \\"sophisticated show of Balvin‚Äôs sonic palette\\". The album artwork was created by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami. Balvin collaborated with Murakami for the music videos and album and single artwork, which notably feature Murakami's flowers, as well as American clothing brand Guess on a capsule collection inspired by the album. Artistry Musical style and influences Critics have contrasted J Balvin's musical style from the first internationally popular wave of reggaeton led by Daddy Yankee. Marlon Bishop of The Fader described his vocal delivery as a \\"gentle drawl\\", differing greatly from the rapid-fire, aggressive delivery of earlier reggaeton acts. He generally sings over his beats as opposed to rapping, and favors a more melodic, pop-influenced style. Describing his music's production, Bishop writes, \\"Instead of the hard-edged, maximalist beats of the first wave, Balvin‚Äôs tracks are moody and spaced out\\". He frequently works with Medellin-based writer/producers Alejandro \\"Sky\\" Ramirez and Carlo Alejandro \\"Mosty\\" Pati√±o, whom he often name-drops in his songs. He has been credited with popularizing a new style of reggaeton based in Medellin, along with Maluma and Puerto Ricans who have relocated to the city to become involved in the reggaeton scene, such as Nicky Jam and Farruko. Though he cites Daddy Yankee as his biggest musical inspiration, J Balvin's earliest influences were rock bands such as Metallica and Nirvana, as well as salsa legend Hector Lavoe. He has covered Nirvana's hit \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" in live performances. As a teenager, he listened to hip-hop artists such as 2Pac, The Notorious B.I.G., Snoop Dogg, Wu-Tang Clan, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, and Onyx. He also cites albums by Canadian R&B; singer The Weeknd and Puerto Rican reggae band Cultura Prof√©tica as his \\"desert island albums.\\" Pop singer Camila Cabello has cited J Balvin as a musical influence. Public image and lyrics His public image was described by Bishop by saying, \\"J Balvin‚Äôs not a bad boy, he‚Äôs a good guy with a well-tended naughty side.\\" He often interacts with fans on social media sites such as Snapchat and Instagram, and cites these platforms as essential for his success. His musical partner Mazo explained, \\"We wanted to make music that was clean enough for your grandma to like, but sensual enough that the streets would like it too.\\" His lyrics have been described as more vulnerable than typical reggaeton lyrics, discussing interpersonal relationships, exemplified by the single \\"Ay Vamos\\". For this reason, he has been compared to Canadian artist Drake, a comparison with which J Balvin agrees. On the issue of misogyny in reggaeton, J Balvin notes, \\"[I] have mothers, sisters, relatives. Part of what we did is change that misconception that reggaet√≥n is machista and misogynist. On the contrary, women are our biggest fans, and they inspire us.\\" He also refrains from singing about his country's violent past, saying that doing that exacerbates stereotypes about Colombians and that the country has made vast improvements since the days of Pablo Escobar. Instead, he discusses everyday life in his songs. Luis Estrada of Universal Music Latino and Capitol Latin says of Balvin, \\"He breaks every rule of what people think reggaeton is, and they love him for that...He doesn‚Äôt take himself too seriously.\\" J Balvin is unique also in that his dance crew on his videos and concerts are all male. Despite being fluent in English and frequently collaborating with English-speaking artists, J Balvin plans to only sing in Spanish. His goal is to make reggaeton a globally popular genre without having to sing in English to attain crossover success. He explains, \\"I want to keep making history in Spanish. I want to invite the mainstream into my world, and to my sound, and to what I‚Äôm doing. And I want mainstream artists to respect me, and accept Latino artists as equals, without us having to sing in English. I want them to know that I can compete globally with whomever, in Spanish.\\" American artist Pharrell instead sings the hook in Spanish on \\"Safari\\", and J Balvin described having more American musicians singing in Spanish as one of his \\"biggest dreams\\". However, he recorded his first all-English song with Pitbull and Camila Cabello for the 2017 soundtrack to The Fate of the Furious, and explained that he is open to the idea of singing in English if the opportunity presents itself. Fashion J Balvin is noted for his eccentric style, often wearing bright colors and dyeing his hair. J Balvin has called fashion \\"his life‚Äôs passion, on the same level as music.\\" He appeared as an ambassador during the 2017 New York Fashion Week, and has called for greater representation of Latinos in the fashion world. He utilizes eccentric accessories such as cowboy hats, colorful tracksuits, and ripped jeans. Isabela Raygoza described his aesthetic at the 2017 Latin Grammys as a \\"Latin raver Eminem\\" due to his neon blonde hair and brightly colored athletic clothing. His style often combines streetwear traditionally associated with reggaeton artists and classic luxury brands. J Balvin is influenced by musicians such as Kanye West and Pharrell Williams who have made forays into fashion. Discussing Pharrell's influence, J Balvin explained, \\"I don't dress exactly like him, but I want to be like him in the cultural way. He opens the doors for a lot of new fashion designers and creates his own style. It's all about love with him and he's the culture.\\" The musician appeared in Ovadia and Sons' Spring 2017 catalogue. He debuted pieces that he designed in the Colombiamoda Fashion Week show in Medellin in July 2018, where he presented his collaboration with the clothing brand Gef France. The collection was inspired by the colorful, bright aesthetic of his 2018 album, Vibras. In January 2019 Balvin launched another Vibras-inspired clothing campaign with the Guess x J Balvin clothing collection, becoming the first Latin man to collaborate with the brand. J Balvin explained that he \\"grew up with the Guess brand\\" and \\"always respected and identified with the Marciano brothers‚Äô history of taking influence from the country and culture of their heritage, and fusing it with the spirit of the United States\\". Personal life J Balvin in 2018. J Balvin has spoken out about the Venezuelan economic crisis and the situation occurring at the country's border with Colombia, where thousands of Colombians have been forcibly deported. He called the situation \\"deplorable\\" and created the social media campaign #LatinosSomosFamilia (We Latinos are Family), encouraging fans to sign a petition to support the displaced victims. The petition was soon signed by other prominent Latin artists including Colombian singer Maluma. J Balvin's campaign was launched shortly after cancelling his performance on Miss USA 2015 in protest of Donald Trump. He supports LGBT rights, explaining \\"It‚Äôs all about love. A lot of my closest friends are gay\\", and dyed his hair rainbow colors to show support for Pride 2019. In August 2016, the singer was involved in a plane crash while leaving the Bahamas. While returning from a vacation with his family, the plane failed to take off properly and crash landed shortly after departing from the runway. He posted a photo on Instagram of the small private plane after having landed in the bushes. Nobody was injured in the accident, and J Balvin called it \\"a miracle.\\" J Balvin experiences panic attacks and states that \\"meditation saved [his] life\\". When his anxiety was at its worst, he recalled that \\"I forgot about my happiness. I forgot about Jos√© (J Balvin's given name).\\" He is known for his tattoos and got his first tattoo when he was twelve years old. His mother suffers from the rare genetic condition acute intermittent porphyria, which causes seizures, chronic pain, and mental health difficulties. He has the word \\"Familia\\" tattooed on his chest in her honor. Unlike many popular reggaeton singers who move to the United States upon gaining popularity, J Balvin continues to live in his hometown of Medellin, explaining, \\"It keeps me real. I'm gonna be real everywhere I go, but I'm with my people, I'm connected to my roots ‚Äì I'm in my country! I don't need to live somewhere else. I respect the ones who make it and leave their home base, but I'm good in Colombia.\\". In 2020, it was revealed that J Balvin contracted COVID-19, but he has since recovered.  Impact  J Balvin in 2018 J Balvin's global success with his Spanish recordings has been praised by music critics. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) \\"he has pioneered Latin music‚Äôs explosion onto the global stage\\". Billboard described him as \\"the biggest breakout act Latin music has seen in many years\\". Nicole Acevedo of NBC News said that although Latin artists such as Ricky Martin, Enrique Iglesias and Shakira achieved crossover success by recording English-language albums, \\"Balvin is reinventing the way Latin music artists cross over to the U.S. music scene\\" with musical productions recorded entirely in Spanish. Similarly, August Brown of Los Angeles Times commented that \\"Balvin's ideas felt like an inevitable future\\" and is part of a new wave of several Latin artists representing the \\"future of Latin and global pop where language is less a barrier than a invitation\\". J Balvin participation in the reggaeton scene has been noted, a genre previously associated primarily with Puerto Rican and Panamanian artists. He uses reggeaton as a vehicle to \\"expose ideas, identities\\" and other social messages, and is \\"perhaps the genre's most visible star\\" according to American journalist Jon Caramanica. Elias Leight of Rolling Stone included him along Karol G and Ozuna as \\"global hit-makers\\" with reggaeton and trap songs. When Joan Scutia from Mexican Vogue reviewed Balvin's career and success, noted that reggaeton is part of Simon Reynolds' theory about globalization in music: \\"Nothing is foreign in an internet age\\". Evan Lamberg, UMPG's president commented: \\"I consider J Balvin one of the greatest global contemporary songwriters/artists in any genre\\". In a general perspective, Sofia Rocher from Guinness World Records stated J Balvin became \\"leader of a second-generation reggaeton revolution propelling Urban music back to the forefront of Latin music worldwide\\". Univision presented him as \\"Latin Music‚Äôs most popular and influential international artist\\". He was the first Latino to headline world-musical events such as Coachella, Tomorrowland, and Lollapalooza. Iman Amrani from The Guardian felt that Balvin is \\"now arguably Colombia‚Äôs biggest cultural export\\" and described him as example on \\"how embracing national pride can be a force for cultural good\\". Awards and achievements Trophies received by J Balvin photographed in 2018. J Balvin has won numerous awards and achievements. He became the first recipient of the Global Icon Award given by Lo Nuestro Awards, in recognition of his contribution to spread Latin music worldwide, and the first recipient of the inaugural Contemporary Song of the Year at the BMI Latin Awards with \\"Ay Vamos\\". His single \\"Ginza\\" was recognized by Guinness World Records for the longest stay at number 1 on Hot Latin Songs chart ever by a single artist, and is the second artist with the most number one on Latin Rhythm Airplay, behind only Daddy Yankee as of 2019. His music videos have billions of views, and had a consecutive record-setting of 100 million views on VEVO with \\"Tranquila\\", 6 A.M.\\", \\"Ay Vamos\\" and \\"Ginza\\", which marked the most viewed Spanish video debut in history. \\"Ay Vamos\\" became the first reggeaton song to exceed one billion views on YouTube. In addition, VEVO named Balvin \\"most watched Latin artist of 2015\\" and he became the \\"most viewed artist on YouTube Global\\" as of 2019. Balvin has multiple streaming records. \\"Mi Gente\\" is the first Spanish language song to be number one on Spotify's Global Top 50 Chart, and he became the most streamed artist on Spotify as of 2018, overtaking Drake's previous record. He remains on Top 5 as of April 2020. With his album Colores set a new record with all his songs occupying the Top 10 on Spotify. Additionally, he became the first Latin artist to reach one billion streams on Apple Music. His other achievements include selling 35 million singles worldwide, and 25 billion streams as of 2020.

During the inter-war period, he was Minister of Transport during the 1929‚Äì1931 Labour Government, then, after losing his seat in Parliament in 1931, became Leader of the London County Council in the 1930s. Returning to the Commons in 1935, he was defeated by Clement Attlee in the Labour leadership election that year, but later acted as Home Secretary in the wartime coalition. Morrison organised Labour's victorious 1945 election campaign, and was appointed Leader of the House of Commons and Deputy Prime Minister in Attlee's governments of 1945‚Äì51. Attlee, Morrison, Ernest Bevin, Stafford Cripps and (initially) Hugh Dalton formed the \\"Big Five\\" who dominated those governments. Morrison oversaw Labour's nationalisation programme, although he opposed Aneurin Bevan's proposals for a nationalised hospital service as part of the setting up of the National Health Service. Morrison developed his social views from his work in local politics and always emphasised the importance of public works to deal with unemployment. In the final year of Attlee's premiership, Morrison had an unhappy term as Foreign Secretary. He was hailed as \\"Lord Festival\\" for his successful leadership of the Festival of Britain, a critical and popular success in 1951 that attracted millions of visitors to fun-filled educational exhibits and events in London and across the country. Morrison was widely expected to succeed Attlee as Labour leader, but Attlee, who disliked him, postponed stepping down until 1955. Morrison, who was by then considered too old, came a poor third in the ensuing Labour leadership election.Laybourn, Keith (2002) ‚ÄúMorrison, Herbert Stanley‚Äù in John Ramsden, ed., The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-century British Politics. Oxford University Press. . pp. 443‚Äì44 Early life Morrison was born in Stockwell, Lambeth, London, to Priscilla (n√©e Lyon; died 1907) and Henry Morrison (died 1917), one of six children who survived infancy. Henry Morrison was a police constable, whose Conservative political opinions his son would later come to disagree with strongly. As a baby, he permanently lost the sight in his right eye due to infection. He attended Stockwell Road Primary School and, from the age of 11, St Andrew's Church of England School. He left school at 14 to become an errand boy. His early politics were radical, and he briefly flirted with the Social Democratic Federation over the Independent Labour Party (ILP). As a conscientious objector, he worked in a market garden in Letchworth in World War One. Political career Early career Morrison eventually became a pioneer leader in the London Labour Party. He was elected to the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney in 1919 when the Labour Party won control of the Borough, and he was Mayor in 1920‚Äì21. Morrison was a follower of Clapton Orient FC and became a shareholder in the club. He was elected to the London County Council (LCC) in 1922 and at the 1923 general election he became Member of Parliament (MP) for Hackney South, but lost that seat the following year when Ramsay MacDonald's first administration lost the general election.Howell, David (2004) \\"Morrison, Herbert Stanley, Baron Morrison of Lambeth (1888‚Äì1965)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press; Morrison returned to Parliament in the 1929 general election, and MacDonald appointed him Minister of Transport. Morrison, like many others in the party, was deeply disheartened by MacDonald's national government, and he lost his seat again in 1931. London Morrison continued to sit on the London County Council and in 1933 was elected to lead the Labour Group. He wrote a book Socialisation and Transport : the Organisation of Socialised Industries with Particular Reference to the London Passenger Transport Bill which encapsulated his ideas on nationalisation. Managers would be appointed to run monopoly industries in the public interest. He did not, however, envisage democratic control by the workers. Unexpectedly, Labour won the 1934 LCC election and Morrison became Leader of the council. This gave him control of almost all local government services in London. His main achievements here included the unification of bus, tram and trolleybus services with the Underground, by the creation of the London Passenger Transport Board (colloquially known as London Transport) in 1933, and creating the Metropolitan Green Belt around the suburbs. He confronted the Government over its refusal to finance the replacement of Waterloo Bridge, and eventually they agreed to pay 60% of the cost of the new bridge. In the 1935 election, Morrison was once again elected to the House of Commons and immediately challenged Attlee for the leadership of the party. He was defeated by a wide margin in the final ballot, a defeat ascribed to his unfamiliarity with the MPs who had served in the previous Parliament. Both he and his supporter Hugh Dalton put some of the blame on the Masonic New Welcome Lodge, who, they claimed, backed the third-place leadership candidate Arthur Greenwood and then switched their votes to Attlee. This cites as note number 2 H. Morrison, Herbert Morrison: An Autobiography by Lord Morrison of Lambeth, London, Odhams, 1960, p. 164 After losing, Morrison concentrated on his LCC work. He convinced Labour to adopt the new electioneering techniques that opponents had been using, especially using advertising agencies in the 1937 local elections.Dominic Wring, \\"‚ÄúSelling socialism‚Äù-The marketing of the ‚Äúvery old‚Äù British Labour Party.\\" European Journal of Marketing 35#9/10 (2001): 1038-1046. online For example, he stressed housing, education and his own leadership with posters featuring Morrison alongside children and with a backdrop of new LCC flats above slogans such as \\"Labour Puts Human Happiness First\\", \\"Labour Gets Things Done\\" and \\"Let Labour Finish the Job.\\"Donoughue and Jones, 1972, pp. 209-11 In 1939, Conservative MPs defeated Herbert Morrison's bill introducing \\"site value rating\\", a tax on similar lines to Land Value Tax, in the old London County Council area.Wetzel, Dave (20 September 2004) The case for taxing land. New Statesman. By the late 1960s, long after Morrison had left the leadership of the London County Council, London Conservatives frequently accused him of seeking to \\"build the Tories out of London\\",Ken Young, John Kramer, Strategy and conflict in metropolitan housing (Heinemann Educational, 1978), p. 262. the implication being that the LCC would deliberately build council houses in order to affect local voting patterns. His biographers, Bernard Donoghue and George W. Jones, have written that \\"Morrison never said or wrote\\" the words attributed to him.Donoghue and Jones, Herbert Morrison: Portrait of a Politician. p. xxxi Wartime Coalition In 1940, Morrison was appointed the first Minister of Supply by Winston Churchill, but shortly afterwards succeeded Sir John Anderson as Home Secretary. Morrison's London experience in local government was particularly useful during the Blitz, and the Morrison shelter was named after him. He made radio appeals for more fire guards in December 1940 ('Britain shall not burn').audiobook titled The Blitz Morrison had to take many potentially unpopular and controversial decisions by the nature of wartime circumstances. On 21 January 1941, he banned the Daily Worker for opposing war with Germany and supporting the Soviet Union. The ban lasted for a total of 18 months before it was rescinded. The arrival of black American troops caused concern in the government, leading Morrison, the Home Secretary, to comment \\"I am fully conscious that a difficult social problem might be created if there were a substantial number of sex relations between white women and coloured troops and the procreation of half-caste children.\\" That was in a memorandum for the cabinet in 1942.Marc Blitzstein, Roland Hayes and the ‚ÄòNegro Chorus‚Äô at the Royal Albert Hall in 1943. nickelinthemachine.com. May 2011 In 1942, Morrison was confronted with an appeal from the Central British Fund for German Jewry (now World Jewish Relief) to admit 350 Jewish children from Vichy France.Gottlieb, Amy Zahl.

London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998, p.175 Although Case Anton ensured the scheme's failure, Morrison had been reluctant to accept it beforehand, wanting to avoid provoking the ‚Äòanti-foreign and anti-semitic feeling which was quite certainly latent in this country (and in some isolated cases not at all latent)‚Äô.Gottlieb, Amy Zahl. Men of Vision: Anglo-Jewry's Aid to Victims of the Nazi Regime, 1933-1945.

(2004) \\"Greenwood, Arthur (1880‚Äì1954)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Deputy Prime Minister After the end of the war, Morrison was instrumental in drafting the Labour Party's 1945 manifesto Let us Face the Future. He organised the general election campaign and enlisted the help of left-wing cartoonist Philip Zec, with whom he had clashed during the early stages of the war when, as Minister of Supply, he took exception to an illustration commenting on the costs of supplying the country with petrol.Contentious Cartoon by Dr Tim Benson , PoliticalCartoon.co.ukTabloid Nation: The Birth of the Daily Mirror to the Death of the Tabloid, by Chris Horrie, Andr√© Deutsch (2003) Labour won a massive and unexpected victory, and Morrison was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the House of Commons, having switched his own seat to Lewisham East. He was the chief sponsor of the Festival of Britain. Morrison supervised the major Labour programme of nationalising large sectors of industry. As Lord President chaired the committee on the Socialization of Industries, he followed the model that was already in place of setting up public corporations, such as the BBC in broadcasting (1927). The owners of corporate stock were given government bonds, and the government took full ownership of each affected company, consolidating it into a national monopoly. The management remained the same, only now they became public servants working for the government. For the Labour Party leadership, nationalisation was a method to consolidate national planning in their own hands. It was not designed to modernise old industries, make them efficient, or transform their organisational structure.Sked, Alan and Cook, Chris (1979) Post-War Britain: A Political History. . pp 31‚Äì34Beer, Samuel H. (1965) British Politics in the Collectivist Age. pp 188‚Äì216 In July 1946, Morrison, together with US ambassador Henry F. Grady proposed \\"The Morrison-Grady Plan\\", intended to resolve the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, calling for federalisation under overall British trusteeship. Ultimately, the plan was rejected by both Palestinians and Israelis. After Ernest Bevin's resignation as Foreign Secretary, Morrison took over his role, but did not feel at ease in the Foreign Office. He took an aggressive stance against Iran's nationalist Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq and approved his overthrow. His tenure there was cut short by Labour's defeat in the 1951 general election, and he was appointed a Companion of Honour in November that year. Festival of Britain Skylon at the Festival of Britain, 1951 Morrison lacked a deep concern for foreign affairs, but he was an enthusiastic leader of a major domestic project, the Festival of Britain. Starting in 1947, he was the prime mover of the 1951 fair. The original goal was to celebrate the centennial of the Great Exhibition of 1851.Bernard Donoughue, and G. W. Jones, Herbert Morrison: Portrait of a Politician (1973), pp 492-95. However, the plans were changed. It was not to be another World Fair, and international themes were absent; even the Commonwealth was ignored. Instead, the Festival focused entirely on Britain and its achievements; it was funded chiefly by the government, with a budget of ¬£12-million. The Conservatives gave little support. The Labour government was losing support, and the implicit goal of the festival was to give the people a feeling of successful recovery from the war's devastation, as well as promoting British science, technology, industrial design, architecture and the arts.F.M. Leventhal, \\"'A Tonic to the Nation': The Festival of Britain, 1951.\\" Albion 27#3 (1995): 445-453. Historian Kenneth O. Morgan says the Festival was a \\"triumphant success\\" as thousands: :flocked to the South Bank site, to wander around the Dome of Discovery, gaze at the Skylon, and generally enjoy a festival of national celebration. Up and down the land, lesser festivals enlisted much civic and voluntary enthusiasm. A people curbed by years of total war and half-crushed by austerity and gloom, showed that it had not lost the capacity for enjoying itself....Above all, the Festival made a spectacular setting as a showpiece for the inventiveness and genius of British scientists and technologists. End of political career Although Morrison had effectively been Attlee's heir presumptive since the 1930s, Attlee had always distrusted him. Attlee remained as Leader through the early 1950s and fought the 1955 election, finally announcing his retirement after Labour's defeat. Morrison was then 67, and was seen to be too old to embark on a new leadership role. During the leadership election, he was the interim Leader of the Labour Party. Although he stood, he finished last, by a wide margin, of the three candidates, with many of his supporters switching to Hugh Gaitskell. Gaitskell won the election, and Morrison resigned as Deputy Leader. During the Suez Crisis, Morrison advocated unilateral action by the United Kingdom against Egypt, following Colonel Nasser's seizure of the Suez Canal. Morrison stood down at the 1959 general election and was made a life peer as Baron Morrison of Lambeth, of Lambeth in the County of London on 2 November 1959. He was appointed President of the British Board of Film Censors.  Personal life  While working in a market garden in Letchworth during World War One, Morrison met his first wife, Margaret Kent (1896‚Äì1953), a secretary and daughter of a railway clerk. The couple married on 15 March 1919. His total involvement in politics, however, meant that theirs was not a happy marriage; his later autobiography made no mention of Kent or their daughter, Mary. Following Kent's death in July 1953, Morrison married Edith Meadowcroft (b. c.1908), a businesswoman of Conservative politics. The pair married on 6 January 1955 and their relationship appeared much more successful. Morrison's grandson Peter Mandelson was a cabinet minister in the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Death He died on 6 March 1965, coincidentally in the same month as the London County Council was abolished. TV portrayal Morrison was Foreign Secretary at the time of the defection of the double agents Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean. In the 1977 Granada TV play Philby, Burgess and Maclean by Iain Curteis, Arthur Lowe appeared as Morrison ‚Äì glowering to the camera in his final shot to show the opaque right lens of his spectacles.

The Hindenburg disaster Morrison and engineer Charlie NehlsenBBC Prime: TV Documentary: Days That Shook the World (2003): TV Episode: Disaster in the Skies (2004); Charlie Nehlsen played by Dickon Tolson had been assigned by station WLS in Chicago to cover the arrival of the Hindenburg in New Jersey for delayed broadcast. Radio network policy in those days forbade the use of any other recorded material than that used for sound effects, and Morrison and Nehlsen had no facilities for live broadcast. Even so, the results still became the prototype for news broadcasting in the war years that followed. The event had no effect on this policy, and recordings were not regularly used until after the end of World War II.

Morrison and Nehlsen continued their work, reporting at length on the rescue efforts and interviewing survivors, with several pauses while Morrison composed himself.

Thirty-five people died in addition to one fatality on the ground. The 16-inch green lacquer disk recordings were rushed back to Chicago by airplane and broadcast in full later that night. Portions were rebroadcast nationally by the NBC Radio network the next day. It was the first time that recordings of a news event were ever broadcast, and also the first coast-to-coast radio broadcast. Morrison's quick professional response and accurate description combined with his own emotional reaction have made the recordings a classic of audio history. Several people believe that this classic recording is not an accurate reflection of Morrison's speech. These people theorize that Nehlsen's Presto 6D recorder ran about 3% slow, causing Morrison's voice to sound different from how it actually was, and that Morrison's normal speaking and radio announcer voice was actually quite deep as evidenced by other recordings of his voice from the same era. One of these people is audio historian Michael Biel of Morehead State University, who studied the original recordings and analyzed Nehlsen's vital contribution as an engineer as well as the playback speed issue: Morrison's description has been dubbed onto the newsreel film of the crash, giving the impression of a modern television-style broadcast. However, at the time, newsreels were separately narrated in a studio, and Morrison's words were not heard in theaters. The availability of newsreel films, photographs and Morrison's description was a result of heavy promotion of the arrival by the Zeppelin Company, making the crash a media event and raising its importance far beyond other disasters, less well-reported and documented. Morrison's usual broadcast work was as an announcer on live musical programs, but his earlier successful reporting of Midwestern floods from an airplane led to his assignment at Lakehurst that day. Morrison later served in the Army Air Forces during World War II and was the first news director at WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh. He also ran for Congress three times as a Pennsylvania Republican. Prior to retirement he served as a technical adviser for the 1975 film The Hindenburg and developed a radio and television section at West Virginia University. In popular culture *In the fourth episode of season 4 of The Simpsons, \\"Lisa The Beauty Queen\\", a Duff Beer blimp crashes into a broadcasting antenna and catches fire in a similar fashion to the Hindenburg. The news reporter exclaims \\"Oh the humanity!\\" upon seeing it. *In the pilot episode of Timeless, Morrison is portrayed by Donal Thoms-Cappello. He is shown narrating the arrival of the Hindenburg in both the original version of the landing and the alternate version of the landing which the time travelers diverge. *In season 8 episode 16 of Seinfeld, \\"The Pothole\\", Newman yells \\"Oh, the humanity\\" as his postal truck bursts into flames. *The event is also parodied in the WKRP in Cincinnati episode \\"Turkeys Away\\", with Les Nessman echoing some of Morrison's dramatic words. *In the 2000 film Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas, the Grinch yells \\"Oh, the Who-manity!\\" when the Whoville Christmas tree burns to ground. *In the 1988 film Heathers, the phrase \\"Oh, the humanity!\\" is used frequently as a reference. *In the 2008 game Spore there's an achievement for destroying planet Earth called \\"Oh the Humanity!\\" *In Season 1, Episode 7 of Archer, \\"Skytanic\\", Archer yells \\"Oh, the humanity\\" when talking about the luxury airship Excelsior.

The Rothschild family was founded by Mayer Amschel Rothschild. Wanting his sons to succeed on their own and to expand the family business across Europe, he had his eldest son remain in Frankfurt, while his four other sons were sent to different European cities with the mission of establishing a financial institution to invest in business and provide banking services. Endogamy within the family was an essential part of the Rothschild strategy in order to ensure control of their wealth remained in family hands. Through their collaborative efforts, the Rothschilds rose to prominence in a variety of banking endeavours including loans, government bonds and trading in bullion. Their financing afforded investment opportunities and during the 19th century they became major stakeholders in large-scale mining and rail transport ventures that were fundamental to the rapidly expanding industrial economies of Europe. Five lines of the Austrian branch of the family were elevated into the Austrian nobility, being given hereditary baronies of the Habsburg Empire by Emperor Francis II in 1816. The British branch of the family was elevated into the British nobility by Queen Victoria.The House of Rothschild: Money's prophets, 1798‚Äì1848, Volume 1, Niall Ferguson, 1999, introductionThe House of Rothschild: Money's prophets, 1798‚Äì1848, Volume 1, Niall Ferguson, 1999, page 481-85 This article shows the family tree of some of the prominent branches of the Rothschild family. The founder and his children Mayer Amschel Rothschild Mayer Amschel Rothschild was born in 1744 in the ghetto in Frankfurt. At the age of 13, he went to Hanover to serve an apprenticeship with the bank of Simon Wolf Oppenheimer. At the age of 19, he returned to Frankfurt. There he joined his brother Calmann's money-changing business. He became a dealer in rare coins and won the patronage of Wilhelm IX of Hesse, gaining the title of \\"court factor\\". Rothschild's coin business expanded through the provision of banking services to Wilhelm IX. His bank became one of the biggest in Frankfurt. He married Guttle Schnapper in 1770. With her, he had 10 children.

Resume Br√°s de Oliva Domingos is the son of writer know and worldwide, and for that reason, dreams of being one. He works finishing others' books, while yours is still in the beginning. His life as a dreamer ends after his sad death, and the narrator decides to recall the most important moments of the character's life: travel, family, relationship, childhood, fatherhood.https://www.omelete.com.br/quadrinhos/daytripper-classico-de-fabio- moon-e-gabriel-ba-e-relancado-no-brasil Collected editions The series has been collected into a trade paperback: *Daytripper (256 pages, Titan Books, March 2011, , DC Comics, February 2011, ) *Daytripper (272 pages, Titan Books, March 2011, , DC Comics, April 2014, ) Reception The trade paperback went into the New York Times Paperback Graphic Books chart at #1 in February 2011, and returned to the chart at the same position in mid-March, where it stayed for a week, before dropping to #2 the following week. Daytripper was selected as the 2014 Life of the Mind book at the University of Tennessee (UT) in Knoxville. The Life of the Mind program at UT is a common reading program for all incoming first-year students. Daytripper is the first graphic novel and the first Brazilian work to be selected for the program. It is often named among the best graphic novels of the modern era. Prominent reviewer GoodOKBad gave it a perfect 3-star rating and praised the art and emotion that is brought along with the characters. Brazilian influences Daytripper presents many Brazilian influences regarding language, literature and culture. The most predominant influence in the book is the main character's first name. The name \\"Bras\\" can be seen as a reference to the country Brazil, where Daytrippers creators were born, since this name is composed of the first four letters of the country written in Portuguese, \\"Brasil\\". This name can also be perceived as a reference to one of the most famous characters in Brazilian literature, Br√°s Cubas. Such character appeared in Mem√≥rias P√≥stumas de Br√°s Cubas (The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas), by Brazilian author Machado de Assis. In an interview with A Filanctera, a Brazilian blog about illustrations, B√° and Moon explained that the character \\"is a homage, a homage that makes sense because Bras's father is a very famous writer. The kind of father that would give his children the name of novel's characters. And also because Bras dies, and Br√°s Cubas dies as well\\".Translated from \\"Ele √© uma homenagem, uma homenagem que faz sentido porque o pai do Br√°s, ele √© um escritor muito famoso. Do tipo que daria o nome de personagem de livro aos filhos. E tamb√©m porque o Br√°s morre, o Br√°s Cubas morre.\\" In both stories the characters are narrating the story of their deaths: while Bras Cubas makes it clear to the reader that he is already dead and is telling the story of his life, Bras de Oliva Domingos dies unexpectedly in many different ways at the end of each chapter. Another Brazilian influence found in Daytripper is regarding the use of Portuguese language. In chapter 3, when Bras dies hit by a delivery truck, an important saying is written in it: \\"Foda. entregas\\".Moon and B√°, Daytripper, p. 80. This translates is \\"Fuck. delivery\\", which could be perceived as a reference to the situation experienced by the main character, dying moments after seeing \\"...the woman he was going to spend the rest of his life with.\\"Moon and B√°, Daytripper, p. 78. In addition to language and literature, Brazilians' behaviour regarding family is also depicted in Daytripper. In chapter 5, during which Bras and his parents visit his grandparents in the countryside, all the family is reunite: cousins, uncles, aunts. The act of getting the entire family united every weekend is a common tradition in Latin America, in which the value of family is highly considered. According to Clutter and Nieto, \\"Traditionally, the Hispanic family is a close-knit group and the most important 5 social units. The term familia usually goes beyond the nuclear family. The Hispanic 'family unit' includes not only parents and children but also extended family.\\" Although Brazil is not a Hispanic country (being discovered and ruled by Portugal from 1500 to 1822), this custom is found in many Latin countries, from Latin America to the original European ones (Porgual, Spain, Italy and France). Another big influence of Brazilian culture in the graphic novel is related to food. In chapter 5, when the entire family is united to eat lunch, the dishes are all traditional in Brazilian cuisine. That basic meal consists of \\"Rice and beans, potatoes, lettuce, ‚Äî all very simple and homemade ‚Äî but lunch always felt like a loud happy feast... Chicken was the kids' favorite dish, so grandma always cooked it.\\" Moon and B√°, Daytripper, p. 113 The basis of Brazilian lunches and dinners are chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, and potatoes. In accordance with Botelho, \\"Beyond the regional differences, the daily dish eaten on almost all tables of the country is the duo rice with beans, accompanied by a salad, some kind of meat and manioc flour. The Aur√©lio dictionary of the Portuguese language defines the duo feij√£o-com-arroz (beans with rice) as 'of everyday use; common; usual'. It is a true element of national identity, which embraces the people from North to South.\\" Daytripper also describes Brazilians' culture regarding soap operas. In chapter 5, when Bras says, \\"Grandma named the chickens after characters from her soap operas\\", the great influence of this type of show in Brazilian people is depicted. While in some countries movies or TV series are the most watched television program, in Brazil soap operas are by far the most famous type of program. According to Brazilian Business, \\"Rede Globo soap operas are really famous and it happens inside and outside the country. There are some other broadcasters that advertise their programs saying 'After the Globo's soap opera, switch to our channel'.\\" Awards *2011: ** Won \\"Best Limited Series or Story Arc\\" Eisner Award ** Won \\"Best Single Issue or Story\\" Harvey Award ** Won \\"Favourite New Comicbook\\" Eagle Award Notes References  External links * Daytripper on Moon and B√°'s blog * Daytripper on Vertigo's blog * Daytripper #1 review, Comic Book Resources * Tennessee Today article Category:Harvey Award winners for Best Single Issue or Story Category:Comics set in Brazil Category:Brazilian graphic novels ","title":"Daytripper (DC Comics)"},{"id":"32506786","text":"Naradasu Laxman Rao is an Indian politician and a Member of Legislative Council in Telangana.http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/cities/hyderabad/13-mps-t- resign-985 He belongs to Telangana Rashtra Samithi.http://www.hindu.com/2011/05/15/stories/2011051552650300.htm He is an MLC from Karimnagar.http://www.hindu.com/2011/03/10/stories/2011031055390500.htm References Category:Telangana Rashtra Samithi politicians Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Naradasu Laxman Rao"},{"id":"32506810","text":"Vara Vikrayam () is a famous novel and play with same name by Kallakoori Narayana Rao.

It has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. History Down End Castle was built at Down End, north of Dunball in Somerset, England.Prior, p.88. The castle has a motte and bailey design, with the two baileys lying to the north of the motte; the inner bailey has one bank and the outer one a double bank. The mound measures across the top, and may have exploited an existing Viking site. The castle was once fed water by a natural spring at the base of the motte.Prior, p.61. Recent academic work has suggested that the castle was built around 1100, after the surrounding region of Somerset had become stable in the years following the Norman invasion of England and the subsequent Anglo-Saxon rebellion against Norman rule.Prior, pp.88-9. The location Down End was strategically well placed, as the nearby Parrett is an important tidal river, essential for trade during the early medieval period.Prior, p.89. The de Columbers were probably responsible for building the castle, which also enjoyed a good defensive position on a natural ridge, protected by several nearby streams; the family also built nearby Stowey Castle. Norman and later pottery and iron objects were found during excavations in 1908; these match those found at the nearby castle of Neroche, also built around 1100.; Prior, p.89. Down End became a new borough town in 1225, but may have existed as a settlement and port from 1159 onwards; the de Columbers were lords of the manor of nearby Puriton in the late 12th century.Dunning, p.37; Prior, p.89. After the creation of Bridgwater town and castle, however, Down End began to face fierce competition as a port: Bridgwater eventually became dominant and Down End went into decline.Creighton, p.154.

Chris Meek hosting a SoldierStrong fundraising charity event at Honeywell, Washington D.C.; May 20, 2014. In April 2009, Meek held his first in a series of loan modification events at the Yerwood Center in Stamford. The event consisted of five banks and several agencies offering assistance to avoid foreclosure. The program enabled 36 families to modify their mortgage, avoid going into foreclosure and losing their homes. Meek created the not-for- profit START Now! in May 2009, which extended similar assistance to 252 families over 11 events. In July 2009, Meek received a request from a U.S. marine asking for help in obtaining hygienic items for our American soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. This led him to create the not-for-profit SoldierStrong. Since its founding, SoldierStrong has shipped more than 75,000 pounds of basic supplies to 73 units in Iraq and Afghanistan. In June 2012, SoldierStrong launched a scholarship initiative partnering with the Maxwell School at Syracuse University and the Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. That July, SoldierStrong expanded its efforts launching the new SoldierStrong Veterans Grant Foundation to help those returning from the frontlines. A year later, in July 2013, SoldierStrong again set its focus on returning veterans and further expanded the scope of the not-for-profits‚Äô efforts. Partnering with Ekso Bionics, SoldierStrong began working to give paralyzed veterans the ability to walk again. In October 2013, SoldierStrong launched a fundraising campaign to raise funds to provide robotic exo-skeletal suits to veterans. Dan Rose became the first recipient of an Ekso suit from SoldierStrong in December 2013. Rose was paralyzed after the truck he was commanding struck an IED in Afghanistan on April 27, 2011. Since donating the first suit, SoldierStrong has partnered with VA facilities across the country to expand the reach of these transformational devices. As of March 2020, SoldierStrong has donated 24 exoskeleton suits.

Football career Jones was born in the village of Penrhiwceiber, near Aberdare and started his football career with Aberdare Athletic in 1898, becoming team captain in 1901. In March 1901, he became the first player from South Wales league football to be selected for Wales, when he played in the 1‚Äì1 draw with Scotland followed by a 6‚Äì0 defeat by England. (In the latter match, four goals were scored by Steve Bloomer.) Described as \\"a sound tackler who played well within himself\\" who was \\"adept at feeding the wingmen\\", his transfer to Kettering in September 1901 was \\"much regretted\\" in his home town. He failed to settle at Kettering and in December he moved to West Ham United in a swap with Peter Kyle. He was relatively successful at the East London club, with only two defeats in 15 Southern League appearances. In the summer of 1902, he returned to Wales joining Aberaman Athletic. At the end of his first season there, he helped Aberaman become the first club from South Wales to reach the final of the Welsh Cup, although the final was a one-sided affair with Wrexham winning 8‚Äì0.

The titular hero is similar to a Zorro during the Joseon period. The drama served as the last project of actor Lee Eon, who died on August 21, 2008, in a motorcycle accident. Synopsis The series starts by stating: \\"Rather than being a person born in chaotic times, better to be reborn as a dog in peaceful times. However, there are some people who are born as dogs in chaotic times. This is their story.\\" The series occurs during the reign (1623‚Äì1649) of King Injo, the 16th ruler of Joseon. Injo was the son of Prince Jeongwon, who himself was the 7th son of King Seonjo, the 14th ruler of Joseon with Royal Noble Consort In of the Suwon Kim clan. The 15th ruler, King Gwanghaegun, was the 3rd son of Seonjo with Gongbin of the Gimhae Kim clan and therefore the Injo's uncle. In 1623, Gwanghaegun was ousted of power by a political plot from the Western faction, that puts Injo on the throne. The turmoil of the civil war was thereafter increased by the Manchu invasions of 1627 and 1636. Two events are the cornerstones of the series and are stepwise described during numerous flashbacks. Both of them were instigated by the conservative Western faction. One of them is the bloody extermination of the \\"Rising Sun Utopia\\" (Muryundang), occurring during the year of the Snake (Gisa year, 1629, Injo '6), and the other is the assassination of Crown Prince Sohyeon by his father in 1645 (Injo '22). The main action is situated circa 1648.

Mandate/Mission A few CISDL Members with CISDL patron H.E. Judge C.G Weeramantry, former Vice-President of the International Court of Justice, after a 2011 meeting. The Centre for International Sustainable Development Law (CISDL) exists to promote sustainable societies and the protection of ecosystems by advancing the understanding, development and implementation of international sustainable development law. As part of its ongoing legal scholarship and research, the CISDL publishes books, articles, working papers and legal briefs in English, Spanish and French. The CISDL hosts academic workshops, dialogue sessions, legal expert panels parallel to international negotiations, law courses and seminar series, and conferences to further its legal research agenda. It provides instructors, lecturers and capacity- building materials for developing country governments and international organisations in national and international law in the field of sustainable development, and works with countries to develop national laws to implement international treaties in these areas.See http://cisdl.org/about-the- cisdl.html International Sustainable Development Law Sustainable development law is found at the intersection of three principal fields of international law: international economic law, international environmental law and international social law. Sustainable development law refers to emerging substantive body of legal instruments, norms and treaties, supported by distinctive procedural elements. In international treaty law, sustainable development is an agreed objective of many international treaties, both at the global and regional levels. As such, sustainable development can be considered part of the 'object and purpose' of a growing number of treaties, and therefore directly relevant in the interpretation of their provisions. The concept appears, often as an objective or preambular reference, in most international statements and declarations related to environmental, social and economic issues since the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit. In the 1992 Rio Declaration and Agenda 21, governments committed to the \\"further development of international law on sustainable development, giving special attention to the delicate balance between environmental and developmental concerns.\\" Sustainable development requires accommodation, reconciliation and integration between economic growth, social justice (including human rights) and environmental protection objectives, towards participatory improvement in collective quality of life for the benefit of both present and future generations. It has also featured as an object and purpose of many international economic, social and environmental treaties involving developed and developing countries, as a concept which guides the decisions of international courts and tribunals, and the holdings of judges in national courts around the world.For more information on International Law on Sustainable Development, see for example Governance The CISDL is federally incorporated as a not-for-profit organisation in Canada since 2001, and governed by a distinguished Board of Governors. It is guided by a roster of international advisors and expert collaborators. The management of the CISDL is entrusted to the CISDL Director as well as the CISDL Secretariat, which is based in Montreal, Canada.See Strategic Objectives The objectives of the CISDL are to: ‚Äì Advance International Sustainable Development Law (ISDL) scholarship through research and analysis. ‚Äì Build capacity, education and experience in ISDL. ‚Äì Support the development and implementation of stronger ISDL. ‚Äì Promote ISDL networks and knowledge dissemination, and ‚Äì Strengthen the CISDL as an institution. Legal Research The CISDL is engaged in six primary areas of sustainable development law research and legal analysis, each of which is led by a CISDL Lead Counsel based at a law faculty, international organisation or firm.For more details about CISDL programmes, see These CISDL programmes focus on intersections and sustainable development related laws on : 1\\\\. Trade, investment and competition 2\\\\. Natural Resources 3\\\\. Biodiversity and Biosafety 4\\\\. Climate Change 5\\\\. Human Rights and Poverty Eradication 6\\\\. Health and Hazards 7\\\\. Governance, Institutions & Accountability The CISDL works in cooperation with a network of developing country faculties of law, and collaborates closely with the Law Faculty of McGill University the University of Cambridge Faculty of Law through the LRCIL and the Universit√© de Montreal through the CERIUM. It has guidance from three Montreal-based multilateral treaty secretariats, the World Bank Legal Vice-Presidency, the United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations Development Programme. It maintains a memorandum of understanding with the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) and the International Development Law Organisation (IDLO). Leading CISDL members serve as expert delegates on the International Law Association Committee on International Law on Sustainable Development. With the International Law Association (ILA) and the International Development Law Organisation (IDLO), under the auspices of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (UN CSD), CISDL chairs a Partnership Initiative, 'International Law for Sustainable Development' that was launched in Johannesburg at the 2002 World Summit for Sustainable Development, to build knowledge about international law on sustainable development.For more on the ILSD Partnership, see Membership CISDL members include learned jurists and scholars from all regions of the world, and a diversity of legal traditions. Through a competitive annual selection process, the CISDL appoints Associate Fellows, Legal Research Fellows and Senior Research Fellows, who are holders of all associated privileges and obligations fellowship. Continuing Legal education The CISDL offers, in partnership with ILA Canadian Branch, an on-line course in international law offered for lawyers seeking to accomplish Continuing Legal Education credits. The course offers through 25 hours of related in-depth online training on international law which can be done from anywhere in the world. Through a series of modules with some of Canada and the World's best international law professors and experts, the International Law course focuses on topics such as the relevance on International law in Canada, trade and investment law, Climate Change, Human Rights.For CISDL online Continuing Legal Education, see http://www.cisdl.org/continuing_education/index.html Sustainable Development Law Website In the Spring 2011, in partnership with ILA, IDLO and LCIL, the CISDL launched a new pilot website on sustainable development law. In recent years, discussions of the role of international law in sustainable development have expanded considerably, the concept of sustainable development is increasingly being invoked before nations and international courts and tribunals worldwide. With this new project, the CISDL sought to develop a tool for researchers around the world studying the legal dimension of sustainable development. This on-line analytical tool comprises a dynamic database of decisions from international courts and tribunals that have referred to, or used, the concept-objective of sustainable development, and related international legal principles. It also includes direct links to the decisions from economic, social and human rights and international public law courts and tribunals that have applied sustainable development principles in the resolution of disputes between 1992 and 2012.To use the new tool, see http://www.cisdl.org/sustainable_development/  References  External links  * www.cisdl.org * www.cisdl.org/continuing_education/ Category:International sustainability organizations Category:Environmental law Category:Legal research institutes Category:Non-profit organizations based in Montreal Category:Legal organizations based in Canada ","title":"Centre for International Sustainable Development Law"},{"id":"32507059","text":"Marianne Oswald (January 9, 1901 ‚Äì February 25, 1985) was the stage name of Sarah Alice Bloch, a French singer and actress born in Sarreguemines in Alsace-Lorraine. She took this stage name from a character she much admired, the unhappy Oswald in the Ibsen play Ghosts.Music: Diseuse, TIME Magazine, June 17, 1940 She was noted for her hoarse voice, heavy half-Lorraine, half- German accent, and for singing about unrequited love, despair, sadness, and death. She sang the songs of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht.Chanson R√©aliste, Remembering Marianne Oswald, in French She was friends with Jean Cocteau, Jacques Pr√©vert, Fran√ßois Mauriac, and Albert Camus.Judge not By Andr√© Gide, Benjamin Ivry at Google Books In fact, the text for one of her album covers was written by Camus.The time of the cherry leaves, A site devoted to songs at the end of the Second Empire (in French) She was an inspiration for the composers Francis Poulenc and Arthur Honegger.Marianne Oswald by Maurice Pauliac of Radio Luxembourg  Biography  Marianne Oswald's parents were Jewish immigrants, exiles from Poland. Both parents died young and she became an orphan in 1917 at the age of 16. Initially she was sent to a boarding school in Munich, but by 1920 she found her way to Berlin where she began singing in the thriving cabarets of the period. During this time, an operation to remove a goiter‚Äîshe called it \\"having my throat cut\\"‚Äîleft her with a permanent hoarse voice which would have a major, and not entirely negative, effect on her singing career. In 1931, with the rise of the Nazi party, and the threat it posed‚ÄîOswald was after all Jewish‚Äîshe was forced to emigrate to Paris where she forged a unique new style of French singing incorporating the techniques of German expressionism. She sang at the cabaret Le Boeuf sur le Toit (the ox on the roof), a tavern which had long welcomed the songs of the French avant-garde. She was one of the first to interpret The Threepenny Opera by Berthold Brecht and Kurt Weill, with lyrics adapted into French by Andr√© Mauprey, for instance singing La complainte de Mackie (a song English speakers know as Mack the Knife) and Pirate Jenny. It was said that she had no voice, that she had an accent you could cut with a knife, that she was too skinny, that she was not beautiful, that her voice‚Äîby turns raw and tender‚Äîwas bizarre and even shocking. It was all true. Moreover, she sang about depressing subjects‚Äîunrequited love, despair, death, and even suicide. And yet, her red hair, her intensity, and the uniqueness of her singing with its peculiar diction and spoken-sung style‚Äîin those days an innovation‚Äîearned her the nickname magnifique de Marianne la Rouge (the magnificent redheaded Marianne).Dictionary of Jewish women of France in the 19th and 20th centuries: Marianne Oswald Many years later, the French singer Barbara records in her memoirs her amazement when a friend introduced her to this artist \\"fierce, modern, desperate, staggering\\".the unfinished autobiography of the French singer-songwriter Barbara , In June 1932 she made her first two recordings‚Äîwith the recording company Salabert: En m'en foutant (In did not care) and Pour m'avoir dit je t'aime (I love you for telling me). She attracted the attention of Jean B√©rard, president of Columbia Records France, and this led to her recording two songs written by , La Complainte de Kesoubah and Le Grand √âtang.Casse Pipe, RFI Musique Creation date: 1990 (Tranchant would later write the songs Appel and Sans repentir especially for her.) Then, in 1934, Jean Cocteau wrote for her Anna la bonne, a \\"spoken song\\" inspired by the sensational news story of the Papin sisters, two servants, who in 1933 senselessly massacred their employers, mother and daughter.La travail en chansons Anna la bonne (in French) Anna la bonne would later be the basis for a 1959 short film of the same name starring Oswald and directed by Claude Jutra. In March 1934 she recorded Le Jeu de massacre, with lyrics by Henri- Georges Clouzot and music by Maurice Yvain. In 1936 she recorded another Cocteau composition, La Dame de Monte-Carlo.The art of Mariane Oswald (1932-1937) , Communaut√© Teemix In 1934, when Oswald sang Jean Tranchant's composition appel (the summons), with its pacifist theme, she was booed off the stage by anti-semites in the audience. The poet and screenwriter Jacques Pr√©vert immediately came to her defense, and this encounter was the beginning of a long and fertile collaboration between the poet and the singer. Later in the summer of 1934, another shocking news story captured the attention of Jacques Pr√©vert. Thirty children had escaped from a prison in Belle-Ile-en-Mer where they had been tormented by sadistic guards. A reward of twenty francs per child was offered to help recapture the miscreants, and ordinary citizens actually joined in the hunt!Roubaud, Louis (1925), Enfants de Cain, Grasset, Paris, OCLC Number 10769600 Pr√©vert responded by writing a poem, La chasse √† l'enfant (The hunt for the child), which was set to music by Joseph Kosma, and recorded by Marianne Oswald in October 1936.Marianne Oswald - La chasse √† l'enfant on YouTube Pr√©vert also intended to make the story into a movie, but this never came to pass. In 1935 Oswald married a Monsieur Colin, a Catholic- born Frenchman. But their union did not survive the war and the racist laws characteristic of the period. In December 1937, the exclusive contract with Columbia ended with Oswald recording one final song written by Pr√©vert and Kosma, The sounds of the night. Until 1939 Marianne Oswald could be heard at the Le Boeuf sur le Toit, at the Alcazar, at , and at Bobino. In 1939, she went into exile in the United States where she performed in nightclubs and on radio, and was sponsored by men such as Malcolm Cowley, John Erskine, and Langston Hughes. In 1942 she appeared with the accordionist John Serry Sr. in a performance of works by the poets Carl Sandburg and Archibald MacLeish at New York City's Town Hall.The Nation 7 March 1942, Vol 154, #10'The New York Times 1 March 1942, P. 36https://archive.li/20070814110438/http://www.thenation.com/archive/detail/13485324 While in the United States, she published a memoir in English, One small voice, in 1945. All together, she remained in America for almost seven years. In 1946 she returned to France. During her six years of exile in America, the taste of the Parisian audience had changed. Marianne Oswald's outr√© style was no longer welcome in the cabarets. She turned to radio and was the subject of a series of programs presented by Cocteau, Camus, Seghers, Ribemont- Dessaignes, Gaston Bonheur, and television producer/director Jean Nohain. Titled The Return of Marianne Oswald, she sang and recited the works of Apollinaire, Paul √âluard, and, of course, Pr√©vert. In 1948 she published an expanded version of her memoirs in French under the title Je n'ai pas appris √† vivre (I have not learned to live), with a preface by Jacques Prevert. In 1938 Marianne Oswald began her acting career with Le Petit chose directed by Maurice Cloche. All together she appeared in seven films between 1938 and 1958. She was especially noted for her performance in the 1949 film Les amants de V√©rone (The Lovers of Verona), directed by Andr√© Cayatte and written by Cayatte and Jacques Pr√©vert. She was a sometimes screenwriter, writing the screenplay for La premi√®re nuit in 1958, and a television short, Bouquet de femmes in 1960.Marianne Oswald at the Internet Movie Database Working with Remo Forlani, she also produced television programs for children, in particular, Terre des Enfants (Children of Earth). For over thirty years Marianne Oswald lived in a room at the famous H√¥tel Lutetia on the Left Bank in Paris, a hotel which ironically had served as the headquarters of the Gestapo during the war. When she died in 1985 at the age of 84, at the hospital in Limeil-Brevannes in the Val-de-Marne, few people attended the funeral. Six years later, in June 1991, her remains were returned to her hometown of Sarreguemines.B√©n√©dicte Mathieu (1991), Coming Home: Marianne Oswald has returned to her hometown, Le Monde, June 11, 1991, p. 19. A plaque with her name was affixed to the corner of Church Street and Rue de Verdun, at the very spot occupied by the building in which she had been born, and which had been destroyed during the war. Tributes * She sings neither well nor ill. Let specialists define her talent. The important thing is that she sings as a torch burns. She is alternately the geranium of the suburbs, the scar of crime, the lantern of the brothel and the whistle of the police. ‚ÄîJean Cocteau * She sings of reality, however it goes beyond reality, she does not pretend to translate, she torments the human soul, and it cuts like a knife. (Elle chante des chansons r√©alistes, cependant elle d√©passe le r√©alisme, elle ne fait pas semblant, elle transpose, elle taraude l'√¢me humaine, elle dessine au burin.) ‚ÄîLouis Leon Martin * I suppose that it is this mighty crimson fire, this flare, this lighthouse, a beacon which infuses this ember fury, this dispenser of acetylene gas and magnesium flame, which explains the effectiveness of this singer, this mime that repels many, but who is nonetheless much needed. (Je suppose que c'est cette puissance rouge d'incendie, de m√©got, de torche, de phare, de fanal, qui l'habite, cet acharnement de braise, cette haleur de gaz d'ac√©tyl√®ne, de magn√©sium et de lampe √† souder, qui forment l'efficacit√© de cette chanteuse, de cette mime que bien des esprits repoussent, mais qui s'impose malgr√© tout.) ‚ÄîJean Cocteau Filmography * 1938: The Little Thing (directed by Maurice Cloche) ‚Äì La camarade * 1949: The Lovers Of Verona (directed by Andr√© Cayatte) ‚Äì Laetitia * 1953: Le Gu√©risseur (directed by Yves Ciampi) ‚Äì La gu√©risseuse Lucie * 1958: The Adventures of Remi (directed by Andr√© Michel) ‚Äì Mrs. Emily Driscoll * 1958: Anna la bonne (short) (directed by Harry K√ºmel) ‚Äì Anna * 1956: The Hunchback of Notre Dame (directed by Jean Delannoy) * 1958: Les Amants de Montparnasse (directed by Jacques Becker & Max Oph√ºls) Television * Marianne Oswald, une flamme, un cri: a musical/biographical documentary directed by Yannick Delhaye, broadcast on France 3 Lorraine in 2014.Marianne Oswald, une flamme, un cri by Nathalie Zanzola, FranceTV: Lorraine, June 16, 2014 Discography * L‚ÄôArt de Marianne Oswald [1932-1937], EPM 982272 (1991). * Kurt Weill in Paris, Assai, 2000.Kurt Weill √† Paris, Amazon.com, Import Bibliography   Colette Godard, Marianne Oswald.
