The highway runs north-south through the Nantahala National Forest in Western North Carolina. Route description NC 28 is part of a three-state highway 28, that totals , from Beech Island, South Carolina to Deals Gap. Southward the road continues as Georgia State Route 28. This is the sole state highway that keeps its exact number as it crosses between Georgia and North Carolina. It heads southeast briefly through Georgia, enters South Carolina as South Carolina Highway 28, re-enters Georgia once more before terminating in South Carolina. NC 28 starts at the Georgia state line in Macon County. From the state line, it follows a winding course northwards to Highlands. There it begins a concurrency with U.S. Route 64 (US 64) on the way northwest to Franklin. Following an interchange with US 23 and US 441, the US 64 concurrency ends and enters the downtown business district of the city. NC 28 forms a concurrency with US 441 Business on the one-way pair of Main Street and Palmer Street. The two roads cross the Little Tennessee River before NC 28 breaks off and heads north out of the city on Harrison Avenue. Though the official routing of the highway is along Harrison Avenue, signage shows NC 28 traveling along Depot Street and Riverview Street bypassing the city downtown. From Franklin it travels north-northwest, mostly following the Little Tennessee River valley. There is a concurrency with US 19 and US 74 between the unincorporated communities of Lauada and Needmore. From Needmore, it follows a westerly course along the southern shore of man-made Fontana Lake. A side road crosses the TVA constructed Fontana Dam; NC 28 skirts the southern boundary of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park before reaching its northern terminus at US 129\\\\. NC 28 overlaps with two state scenic byways: the Waterfall Byway, between Highlands and Franklin, and the Indian Lake Scenic Byway, between Almond and Deals Gap. NC 28 also overlaps parts of the Mountain Waters Scenic Byway, a National Forest Scenic Byway, that traverses through the Nantahala National Forest. History Established in 1938 as the third and current NC 28, it traversed from Georgia to Highlands, where it duplexed with US 64 to Franklin. Continuing northeast from Franklin, it replaced NC 286 to end at US 19, in Lauada. In 1940, NC 28 was extended northeast along US 19 through Bryson City and Ela, then replaced part of NC 107, ending in Cherokee. In 1947, NC 28 was truncated back to its former northern terminus; its former routing to Cherokee becoming US 19A. In 1954, NC 28 was extended southwest along US 19 to Almond and then northwest along new primary routing to Fontana, then replaced NC 288 to its current northern terminus at Deals Gap. In 1974, NC 28 was adjusted to one-way streets in downtown Franklin, in concurrency with US 441 Bus, via Main Street and Palmer Street. The first NC 28 was an original state highway that traversed from NC 10, in Andrews, through Franklin, Highlands, Rosman, Brevard and Hendersonville, to NC 20, in Bat Cave. In 1923, NC 28 was rerouted west of Franklin on new primary routing to Elf and Hayesville, then replacing NC 109 from Hayesville to NC 10, in Murphy. In 1929, NC 28 was extended west from Murphy along new primary routing to the Tennessee state line. In 1932, NC 28 was extended northeast along new primary routing from Bat Cave to Old Fort, where it overlapped with US 70 to Marion; going north from Marion, in concurrency with US 221, it traversed through Linville, Boone and Jefferson (replacing NC 691 in the process) to US 21/NC 26, in Twin Oaks, reaching its high point at long. Also in 1932, US 64 was assigned along NC 28 from the Tennessee state line to Old Fort. In 1934, all of NC 28 was decommissioned in favor of US 64 and US 221\\\\. The second NC 28 existed from 1935-1938, where it had replaced NC 21 between Fayetteville and Delco, through Elizabethtown. It was renumbered as NC 87\\\\. North Carolina Highway 282 North Carolina Highway 282 (NC 282) was established as a new primary routing from the Georgia state line to Highlands. In 1938, NC 282 was renumbered as part of NC 28\\\\. North Carolina Highway 286 North Carolina Highway 286 (NC 286) was an original state highway that began from the Georgia state line, near Otto, to NC 10, along Old Alarka Road. In 1927, NC 286 was renumbered as an extension of NC 285, from the Georgia state line to Franklin. Around 1938, NC 286 was replaced by NC 28 and moved to the north terminus to the community of Swain (today known as Lauada). North Carolina Highway 288 North Carolina Highway 288 (NC 288) was a primary route that served the Fontana area from 1929-1944 and revived again from 1951-1954. The first NC 288 traversed from NC 108, in Deals Gap, to NC 10, in Bryson City. In 1942, construction began on Fontana Dam; which by 1944, NC 288 was decommissioned when a majority of the route was submerged. Various sections of the old highway still exist on higher ground and are incorporated in hiking trails that are easily reachable from the Fontana Dam parking area. The second NC 288 was a return along the western part of the highway that wasn't submerged, linking to the relocated Fontana community. In 1954, new construction was completed between Fontana and Almond, and all of NC 288 was renumbered NC 28\\\\. NC 288 was originally to be rebuilt along the north shore of Fontana Lake by the National Park Service, an agreement that was made between the county, state, and federal government. Construction of New Fontana Road (SR 1364) was completed in 1958, connecting Bryson City to the border of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. From 1960-1970, was built within the park, which was called Lakeview Drive; ending just west of a tunnel, that went through aptly named Tunnel Ridge. Since then, questions about the cost of building the highway and the environmental impact of the road had stopped all further construction. Known unofficially as \\"the Road to Nowhere,\\" it provides access to various hiking trails within the National Park. After being in limbo for forty years, it was finally resolved in February 2010 when the U.S. Department of Interior signed a settlement agreement paying Swain County $52 million instead of building the highway. As of September 2017, only $12.8 million of that has been paid. Four million additional dollars were released by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, and the final installment of $35.2 million was paid on June 29, 2018. However, under a 2010 agreement, the money was deposited with the state treasurer's office. Swain County can spend only the interest the money earns.

After leaving French Sudan in January 1899, they ruthlessly subjected the native peoples, meeting little resistance. One of the few to resist was the sorcerer queen Sarraounia, ruler of the Azna, a pagan people in a long Islamized region. Determined to bar the expedition's road, Sarraounia wrote to Voulet a provocative letter full of insults; the French took up the challenge, and on 15 April left the camp, marching towards the villages of Lougou and Tougana, where Sarraounia had concentrated her forces. The day after, at 6:00, started what Lt. Paul Joalland called \\"one of the hottest moments of the campaign\\". The French found the enemy assembled on the field, while women and children had already retired themselves in a small thick and almost impenetrable bush where the Azna defended themselves when facing a superior enemy. After the Azna had started to disperse under the French gunfire, their lines broke when hit by three grapeshot balls; the Azna then retreated in the bush, where the thick foliage partly protected the natives from the gunfire. The French felt that if left there, the Azna may attack them at night; so it was decided to assault the bush, but being careful to leave a way of escape for the Azna open, so to avoid a too deadly confrontation that could cost too much blood. The French met a strong resistance, killing two riflemen and wounding four, but were at the end successful and forced the Azna to escape. The battle had protracted itself till 13:00, and among the French tirailleurs four were killed and six wounded, with 7,000 cartridges consumed.

Early life and education Born and raised in Toulouse, Esquirol completed his education at Montpellier. He came to Paris in 1799 where he worked at the Salp√™tri√®re Hospital and became a favorite student of Philippe Pinel. To enable Esquirol to take up the intensive study of insanity in an appropriate setting, Pinel reportedly put up the security for the house and garden on Rue de Buffon where Esquirol established a maison de sant√© or private asylum in 1801 or 1802. Esquirol's maison was quite successful, being ranked, in 1810, as one of the three best such institutions in Paris. In 1805 he published his thesis The passions considered as causes, symptoms and means of cure in cases of insanity. Esquirol, like Pinel, believed that the origin of mental illness could be found in the passions of the soul and was convinced that madness does not fully and irremediably affect a patient's reason. Career Esquirol hospital in Saint-Maurice (Val de Marne) Esquirol was made m√©decin ordinaire at the Salp√™tri√®re in 1811, following the death of Jean- Baptiste Pussin, Pinel's trusted concierge. Pinel chose Esquirol because he was, as Pinel put it, \\"a physician... devoted exclusively to the study of insanity,\\"according to Jan Goldstein, Console and Classify: The French Psychiatric Profession (, 1990), page 124 arguing that with his many years of maison de sant√© experience he was the only man suited for the job. Esquirol saw the question of madness as institutional and national. This was especially true for the poor where he saw the state, with the help of doctors, playing an important role. He also saw an important role for doctors in caring for people accused of crimes who were declared not responsible by reason of insanity. In public controversies over this question he promoted the usefulness of the diagnosis of monomania. By taking such an active role in these public matters, his fame eclipsed that of his teacher Pinel. In 1817, under the restored Bourbon monarchy, Esquirol initiated a course in maladies mentales in the makeshift quarters of the Salp√™tri√®re dining hall. This was perhaps the first formal teaching of psychiatry in France. It was in 1817 that he coined the word hallucination. At this time he was neither a professor at the Paris faculty or the chief physician at a Paris hospital, but merely a m√©decin ordinaire. Nonetheless he was reported to have been one of the clinical instructors to whose hospital visits \\"students flock with a kind of frenzy.\\" He had many very distinguished students. In 1810, 1814 and 1817 Esquirol, at his own expense, had toured facilities for lunatics throughout France. In 1818 following these trips he wrote a short memoir presented to the minister of the interior and a more detailed description of his findings published in the Dictionnaire des sciences m√©dicales. These articles described, in precise and frightening terms, the conditions in which the insane lived throughout France. They demonstrate that the reforms undertaken in Paris had not penetrated the provinces. Together these two articles constituted a program of reform directed both at the government and the medical profession. This program consisted of four points: *First, that insanity should be treated in special hospitals by physicians with special training. *Second, that reform involved exporting the advances made in Paris to the provinces. *Third, that \\"a lunatic hospital is an instrument of cure\\". By this he meant that the physical structure of new psychiatric hospitals must be designed to support the practice of the new specialty. *Fourth, Esquirol insisted on the definitive medicalization of the care of the insane. \\"The physician must be, in some matter, the vital principal of a lunatic hospital. It is he who should set everything in motion‚Ä¶ The physician should be invested with an authority from which no one is exempt.\\" At the behest of the minister of internal affairs, Esquirol next undertook a nationwide survey, visiting all the institutions throughout France where mental patients were confined. In 1822 he was appointed inspector general of medical faculties, and in 1825 director of Charenton Hospice. He became the main architect of the national law of 1838 that instituted departmental asylums for all needy French mental patients and that is still in force today. In 1834, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Though he shunned the spotlight so that his name was not known widely among the general public, he was one of the most successful and influential manager-producers in the West End during the middle of the 20th century. Beaumont was brought up in Cardiff, where he joined the staff of a local theatre at the age of fifteen. From there he built a career in theatrical management. His company, H. M. Tennent, which he co-founded in 1936, was based at the old Globe Theatre (now the Gielgud Theatre) in Shaftesbury Avenue, London. His success was based on lavish productions, starry casts and plays calculated to appeal to a West End audience. Among those with whom he was closely associated were No√´l Coward and John Gielgud. His successes included new plays, revivals of classics, and musicals. With the rise of state-subsidised theatre and avant-garde plays from the mid-1950s onwards, Beaumont's genre of opulent productions of safe repertoire started to seem conventional. He recognised this by serving on the board of the new National Theatre during the last decade of his life. Life and career Early years Throughout his life Beaumont was evasive about his background, given, as one biographer wrote, \\"to disseminating fanciful accounts of his origins\\". It was not until a 1989 biography by Richard Huggett that the facts became widely known. He was born Hughes Griffiths Morgan, in Hampstead, London, the son of Morgan Morgan, a barrister, and his wife Mary Frances, n√©e Brewer.Wardle, Irving. \\"Beaumont, Hughes Griffiths (1908‚Äì1973)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 7 March 2013 Morgan divorced his wife for adultery when the boy was two.\\"High Court of Justice\\", The Times, 28 June 1910, p. 3 Mary Morgan then married the co-respondent, William Sugden Beaumont, a Cardiff timber merchant, whom the young Beaumont was brought up believing to be his real father. The boy was formally known as Hugh, but was generally called \\"Binkie\\". The origin of his nickname is uncertain; John Elsom in a 1991 book Cold War Theatre suggests that \\"Binkie\\" was Cardiff slang for a black child or a ragamuffin.Elsom, p. 29 William Beaumont died while Binkie was still a boy. Mary Beaumont then let rooms to a lodger, Major Harry Woodcock, a former Army Entertainments Officer and latterly general manager of the Cardiff Playhouse. At the age of fifteen Beaumont left Penarth Grammar School and became a box- office assistant at the Playhouse; he was appointed assistant manager of the Prince of Wales Theatre in Cardiff a year later.Davie, Michael. \\"Curtains for Binkie\\". The Observer, 12 March 1989, p. 43 He was subsequently business manager for Aubrey Smith's touring company and then of the Barnes Theatre in London for the producer Philip Ridgeway.Gaye, pp. 355‚Äì356 The Barnes Theatre was famous for its productions of Chekhov and the other Russian classics, often directed by Theodore Komisarjevsky. During Beaumont's time with the company five of its productions transferred to the West End, giving him valuable managerial experience in five West End theatres. During his time with Ridgeway, Beaumont met John Gielgud for the first time.Morley, p. 182 Tennent's Beaumont was appointed assistant to Harry Tennent, a senior executive in the Moss Empires theatre chain. In 1933 Tennent engineered the creation of a joint-booking company - which lasted three years - for Moss Empires and Howard & WyndhamGlasgow Alhambra by Graeme Smith, published 2011 and became general manager.\\"The Theatre Royal Drury Lane\\", The Times, 21 December 1933, p. 12 Tennent and Beaumont were unimpressed by the quality of many shows offered by producers for staging in the two groups' theatres. At Beaumont's instigation, he and Tennent went into production and management on their own account in 1936, setting up H M Tennent Limited. Tennent concentrated on the business side of the enterprise, with Beaumont as the producer, choosing plays and engaging directors, actors and designers.Bruguiere, p. 138 Their first production, The Ante Room, by Kate O'Brien at the Queen's Theatre in 1936, was a failure. The firm suffered a series of further flops, running short of capital before finding success with the 1937 production of Gerald Savory's George and Margaret, which ran for 799 performances.Gaye, p. 153 This was followed by Dodie Smith's Dear Octopus (373 performances) and other long-running shows that established Tennent as a highly profitable concern. When the Chamberlain government closed all the theatres in Britain on the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Beaumont had enough clout to persuade the prime minister to cancel the closures less than a week later.Morley, p. 189 John Gielgud Tennent died in 1941, leaving Beaumont in sole control, and for the next twenty years he was one of the most powerful men in British theatre. He maintained a low profile, shunning the limelight partly from natural reticence (saying, \\"I haven't the temperament to be a Cochran or a Diaghilev\\") and partly from his belief that he could operate more effectively behind the scenes.\\"Vivienne Byerley ‚Äì Obituary\\", The Times, 13 April 1995 The first full-length biography of Beaumont, published in 1989, is subtitled \\"√©minence grise of the West End theatre, 1933‚Äì1973\\".Huggett, title page Beaumont gained a strong commercial advantage over his rivals by setting up a subsidiary company to present classic plays: he successfully maintained that this operation qualified as \\"educational\\", and was thus exempt from tax. With productions such as The Importance of Being Earnest, with Gielgud and Edith Evans, and Hamlet, with Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft, Beaumont made large profits from this ostensibly charitable enterprise. Gielgud was a strong influence on Beaumont's aesthetic development, and they maintained a mutually beneficial association which survived despite a personal crisis when Gielgud's then partner John Perry fell for and moved in with Beaumont. Perry remained personally and professionally involved with Beaumont for the rest of the latter's life, and all three remained on close terms.Morley, pp. 182‚Äì183 Another close associate was No√´l Coward. In his play Present Laughter, he caricatured himself and his friends, including Beaumont, portrayed as \\"Henry Lyppiatt\\", the shrewd man of business.Hoare, p. 293 Despite the heavy entertainment tax paid on productions by the main Tennent organisation, Beaumont made substantial profits from such new plays as Coward's Blithe Spirit, which ran for 1,997 performances.Gaye, p. 1525 Postwar Beaumont was always careful to balance innovation and box-office appeal. He combined both in the London premiere of Oklahoma! in 1947, which ran at Drury Lane for 1,543 performances. He promoted the works of new dramatists, including Christopher Fry, Tennessee Williams, and later Robert Bolt and Peter Shaffer, and engaged promising young directors and performers including Peter Brook and Richard Burton. No√´l Coward The rise of state-subsidised theatre, and the emergence of kitchen sink drama undermined Beaumont's pre-eminence beginning in the 1950s. He disapproved of both, and stuck to his style of lavish, starry West End productions, even when they began to go out of fashion. He alienated both Coward and Terence Rattigan with his arrogant and sometimes duplicitous behaviour. Beaumont attempted to sabotage the former's new play Waiting in the Wings by telling him that the actresses Coward wanted to cast refused to play in it, whereas in reality Beaumont had not consulted them.Coward, pp. 436‚Äì437 He continued to have enormous successes: in 1958, he presented the first British productions of both West Side Story (1040 performances) and My Fair Lady (2281 performances). The latter cost an unprecedented sum to stage, but, thanks to a sustained publicity campaign by Tennent's, advance bookings meant that the show was in net profit two months before it opened. Beaumont sufficiently overcame his suspicion of the subsidised theatre to be a founder member of the board of the National Theatre, on which he served with energy and commitment during the last ten years of his life.\\"Mr Hugh Beaumont\\", The Times, 31 March 1973, p. 16 He also continued to run H M Tennent until his death. His last production for Tennent's was a 1973 revival of Maugham's The Constant Wife, starring Ingrid Bergman, directed by Gielgud, which opened after Beaumont's death.Lewsen, Charles. \\"The Constant Wife\\", The Times, 20 September 1973, p. 13; and Wardle, Irving. \\"The changing role of Tennents\\", The Times, 2 February 1978, p. 11 Beaumont died at his house in Lord North Street, Westminster, at the age of 64.

He settled in Paris as a chess professional and writer.http://www.midrasz.home.pl/2002/wrz/wrz02_2.html In 1864, he lost a match to Ignatz von Kolisch (+1‚àí7=0) in Paris. Rosenthal won the Caf√© de la R√©gence championship in 1865, 1866, and 1867 in Paris, and became the strongest French chess player. In 1867, he came ninth in the Paris tournament (von Kolisch won), and lost a match to Gustav Neumann (+0‚àí5=6) in Paris. In 1869, he lost two matches to Neumann (+1‚àí3=1) and (+2‚àí4=1). In July 1870, he tied for 8‚Äì9th places in Baden-Baden. The event was won by Adolf Anderssen. Because of the Franco Prussian War in 1870‚Äì71, Rosenthal moved to London. In 1870‚Äì71, he won a match against John Wisker (+3‚àí2=4). In July‚ÄìAugust 1873, Rosenthal took fourth place, behind Wilhelm Steinitz, Joseph Henry Blackburne, and Anderssen, in Vienna. In 1878, he tied for 7‚Äì8th in Paris (Johannes Zukertort and Szymon Winawer won). In 1880, he won in Paris the first unofficial French Chess Championship (ahead of Albert Clerc and Jules Arnous de Rivi√®re). In 1880, he lost a match against Zukertort (+1‚àí7=11) in London. In 1883, he took 8th in London (Zukertort won). In 1887, he tied for 5‚Äì7th in Frankfurt am Main (5th DSB-Congress, Hauptturnier, elim.).

The railway was intended to be built between to and on to Porth Dinllaen, with branches to and . These branches joined the Bala and Dolgelly Railway and Newtown and Machynlleth Railway respectively. There were two major river bridges on the planned route: the Dovey Bridge, across the River Dovey, and the Barmouth Bridge, over the River Mawddach. The Dovey bridge proved to be impracticable so was not built; an altered route was built from to , near Morben, making a Y-shaped network. The line from Pwllheli to Porth Dinllaen was also not built, although parliamentary powers to do so were obtained on multiple occasions. The routes were opened progressively between 1863 and 1869, all parts of the planned network being built apart from the Dovey Bridge, and Porth Dinllaen to Pwllheli line. The company was absorbed into the Cambrian Railways in 1865. Shortage of money was a continuous problem and delayed completion of the network. The Dolgelly branch was closed in 1966; the rest of the line was under threat of closure in the 1970s but the threat was lifted. In 1980 serious defects were found in Barmouth Bridge due to a marine worm boring into timber piles, and this too seemed to threaten part of the line. This was dealt with and the line continues in operation. History Conception The planned network of the A&WCR; In 1859 the first main line railwayThere were several private mineral lines. in central Wales was opened: it was the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway.Rex Christiansen and R W Miller, The Cambrian Railways: volume I: 1852-1888, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1971, , page 23 At first it was not connected to any other railway, but it fostered interest in railway development, and soon through routes to Newtown both from Chester (opened 1861).Christiansen and Miller, page 31 and from Shrewsbury (opened 1862)Malcolm Reed, The London and North Western Railway: A History, Atlantic Transport Publishers, Penryn, 1996, , page 110 were available. Striking westward and crossing very difficult terrain, the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway was opened on 31 December 1862.There was a \\"Grand Opening\\" afterwards, on 3 January 1863.Gwyn Briwnant-Jones, Railway through Talerddig: The Story of the Newtown & Machynlleth and Associated Railways in the Dyfi Valley, Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1990, , page 48 Although Machynlleth was an important market town, its promoters were considering an extension to Aberystwyth and the Cardigan Bay coast. Due to shortage of subscription money from general investors, the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway was in the hands of a successful partnership of railway contractors, David Davies and Thomas Savin, who put up most of the construction money and took paid up shares as the majority of their payment. These men shared the idea of continuing to the coast, but Savin had an ambitious vision of a huge investment in developing the coastal district, which Davies considered to be over-reaching, and the partnership was dissolved on 30 January 1861.C C Green, The Coast Lines of the Cambrian Railways: volume one, Wild Swan Publications, Didcot, 1993, , pages 1 to 3Peter E Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 11: North and Mid Wales, David St John Thomas, Nairn, 1980, , pages 155 to 161 The Newtown and Machynlleth Railway had preliminary designs made for a coast line, to be called The Machynlleth, Aberystwyth and Towyn Railway. At about the same time, the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway and the Oswestry and Newtown Railway (the latter still under construction), working together, had a coast scheme prepared for a line from Aberystwyth to Pwllheli, with several branches. Davies supported the Towyn scheme, while Savin favoured the line to Pwllheli. Moreover there was now talk of the Pwllheli continuing to Porthdinllaen, on the north side of the Lleyn Peninsula. Porth Dinllaen was a natural harbour on the north side of the Lleyn Peninsula, that had been proposed as a packet station for the Irish mail service. At that time Holyhead had been selected in preference, but Porth Dinllaen still had supporters for development as a ferry port. Authorisation of the A&WCR; Both schemes were to be presented to Parliament for the 1861 session, but in fact the Machynlleth, Abersytwyth and Towyn Railway scheme failed to deposit its documentation in time for the Parliamentary deadline, and was unable to proceed. The Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway Act (in earliest documentation spelt Aberystwith and Welch Coast Railway) alone continued the Parliamentary process and was given the Royal Assent on 22 July 1861; the authorised share capital was ¬£400,000 (later increased). The railway was to extend from Aberystwyth to Portmadoc, an important harbour at the time. There was also to be a branch from Ynyslas to Machynlleth to connect to the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway. The main line would bridge the Dovey estuary with a viaduct from Ynyslas to Aberdovey. Seeing a connection to its own line as essential, the Newton and Machynlleth Railway succeeded in getting a clause in the A&WCR; Act that, if the A&WCR; failed to complete the Machynlleth connection by 1 August 1864, the N&MR; might take the powers over.Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 6Christiansen and Miller, pages 59 to 61 The A&WCR; took stock and now made progress to secure the extension on from Portmadoc to Pwllheli and Porthdinllaen. Railway schemes supported by the Great Western Railway were being planned from Llangollen towards Barmouth, and possibly on from there to north Wales.Baughan, page 137 The A&WCR; wanted to head off the threat; to do so it proposed a branch line from near Barmouth to Dolgelly. The A&WCR; obtained a second Act of 29 July 1862 which authorised these extensions.Green, pages 3 to 9 The Bala and Dolgelley Railway, friendly to the GWR, had been authorised on 30 June 1862, so that when built it would complete a GWR-supported route to Dolgelly from Ruabon.Grant, page 25 Further north, the Carnarvonshire Railway was incorporated on 29 July 1862 with powers to build from Carnarvon to Portmadoc by way of Afon Wen.W G Rear, LMS Branch Lines in North Wales, volume 1, Wild Swan Publications Ltd, 1986, , page 2 The Carnarvonshire Railway authorisation duplicated the A&WCR; as between Afon Wen and Portmadoc. The duplication was ignored at first, but the position was finally resolved by an agreement of 13 December 1865 under which the Cambrian Railways (successor to the A&WCR;) built the section. Construction and early opening The A&WCR; concentrated its construction work on the Machynlleth \\"branch\\", as it was clear that this offered better hopes of an early income, compared with the main line crossing the Dovey estuary. In addition, the deadline set by the clause in the Act had to be achieved. The line was opened from Machynlleth as far as Borth on 1 July 1863; it was worked by Thomas Savin, the contractor who had built the line, for the time being. Opening of the rest of the Aberystwyth line, from Borth to Aberystwyth, was achieved for goods traffic on 23 June 1864; passenger operation had been refused by the Board of Trade inspecting officer, Captain Tyler, but rectification work was put in hand, and passengers were carried from 1 August 1864.Green, page 9 Part of the northern section of the network, from Aberdovey to Llwyngwril, was next opened, on 24 October 1863. The Aberdovey station was at the harbour, and for the time being connected with a ferry from Ynyslas.Christiansen and Miller, pages 61 to 64 The line from Llwyngwril to Barmouth Junction, and from there to Penmaenpool, on the Dolgelly line, followed on 3 July 1865. There was an intermediate station called Barmouth Ferry, at the place where Fairbourne station was later built. Passengers for Barmouth alighted there and walked on across the sand-bar to catch a ferry over the Mawddach estuary to Barmouth harbour.Christiansen and Miller, page 64C C Green, The Coast Line of the Cambrian Railways: volume two, Wild Swan Publications Ltd, Didcot, 1996, , page 1 Authorisation of enhancements The third Bill promoted by the Company was the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway Act, passed on 13 July 1863. It authorised construction of an Aberystwyth Harbour branch, and alteration of the Dovey viaduct, and of the Mawddach bridge to add a vehicular road as well as the railway. The south- western extremity of the Corris Railway was duplicated by the A&WCR; line and was no longer useful; the Corris Railway was authorised to abandon its line west of Machynlleth, by its Act of 25 July 1864.Green, volume 1, page 7 (The Aberystwyth Harbour branch was not constructed because the Cambrian Railways as successor to the A&WCR; wished such traffic to go to Aberdovey.R W Kidner, The Cambrian Railways, Oakwood Press, Headington, 1992, , page 118) Dovey bridge The railway follows the north shore of the Afon Dyfi The A&WCR;'s engineer Benjamin Piercy was dismissed from the company's service early in 1864 as part of a power struggle between Thomas Savin and other factions on the board. He had been progressing the design of the Dovey bridge, but practical and financial difficulties with it had been emerging. In particular finding a good foundation stratum was proving extremely difficult. Piercy's expulsion gave an opportunity to revisit the plan to bridge the estuary, and in May 1864 the decision was taken to abandon the bridging plan.Green, volume 1, pages 8 and 9 In October 1864 preparations were undertaken for a Parliamentary Bill to authorise the abandonment, and to substitute an extension from Aberdovey to a junction with the Aberystwyth line near Morben. The line became known as the \\"deviation line\\" and the junction location was later called Dovey Junction. The Bill was given the Royal Assent on 5 July 1865. The Act stipulated that the fares and goods rates for consignment between Aberdovey and Borth via Morben were to be the same as if the bridge were built and in operation. The GWR had planned to get direct access from Dolgelly to Abersytwyth by way of the bridge, and it got a clause inserted empowering it to build the bridge itself within ten years; it never attempted to do so.Christiansen and Miller, page 66Green, volume 1, pages 11 and 12 The course of the connecting line at Aberdovey was difficult, and a proposed waters' edge route through the town proved unacceptable. An alternative path round the back of the town was developed, but it was operationally difficult, with steep gradients and sharp curves, and three tunnels. In addition, the Aberdovey Harbour station would be by-passed, and there was no space for a new station on the deviation line, and the new Aberdovey was inconveniently located some way west of the town. Into the Cambrian Railways The A&WCR; network in 1869 (under the Cambrian Railways) The group of Newtown railways were now discussing amalgamation: the several small railways would be stronger if they joined forces. The A&WCR; was included in the talks, but there was a standard condition imposed by Parliament in considering amalgamations, that the companies concerned must have spent at least half of their authorised capital, and that at least half of their authorised network must have been built. The A&WCR; was not yet in that position, and had to be excluded from the amalgamation Bill put forward by the other companies. They were authorised to amalgamate, forming the Cambrian Railways, by Act of 25 July 1864. Henceforward the A&WCR; was included in strategic discussions and plans with the Cambrian Railways.Green, volume 1, page 9 A year later, the criterion for amalgamation was achieved, and the A&WCR; was incorporated in the Cambrian Railways by the passing of the Cambrian and Coast Railways (Amalgamation) Act of 5 July 1865: the merger took effect on 5 August 1865. Financial catastrophe The contractor Thomas Savin was undertaking all the remaining construction work for the A&WCR; section of the Cambrian Railways, as well as working the traffic. He had accepted company shares as the major part of payment for his construction work, and he was directly financing company outlays from his own resources. On 5 February 1866 he found himself in serious financial difficulty, and was in effect bankrupt. This put the Cambrian company into difficulty as well. On 10 May 1866 the financial house of Overend, Gurney and Company failed, plunging money markets throughout the United Kingdom into turmoil and making railway investments a source of danger for the public. Many investors were unwilling or unable to respond to calls on shareholdings, and money became very difficult to borrow.Green, volume 2, pages 3 to 7 For some years the company was in serious financial difficulty, and at length mortgage holders sued in the Court of Chancery. The company's Deputy chairman, Captain R D Pryce was appointed Receiver, but they stayed their actions after two months, at the end of 1867.Green, volume 2, pages 6 to 8 In fact the Cambrian Railways as a whole was in serious financial difficulty, with huge obligations and almost no profitable business activity. The Cambrian Railways Finance Act, 1868, was passed on 31 July 1868 and authorised a financial reconstruction, as well as preventing for a period the activation of claims against the company, but although this prevented immediate disaster, it did not abate the problem. Further openings Barmouth viaduct was first tested in July 1866 by crossing a steam engine, but it was not until 3 June 1867 that a service started, and then only of a horse- drawn carriage. Steam trains did not use it regularly until the opening of the entire coast line four months later, when on 10 October 1867 the line was opened through to Pwllheli. Meanwhile on 14 August 1867 the \\"deviation\\" line from Dovey Junction to Aberdovey was opened.Christiansen and Miller, page 69 Pwllheli and Porth Dinllaen Harlech Station and Morfa Harlech Porth Dinllaen had once been promoted as the mail packet terminal for Dublin, but lost out in favour of Holyhead. The A&WCR; still yearned to develop it and got powers to do so in the 1862 Act. When the line reached Pwllheli the vision waned, and continuing across the Lleyn peninsula was not attempted. In 1876 the Cambrian Railways unsuccessfully sought to revive the powers. Undeterred, the Porthdinlleyn Railway Company was incorporated in 1884 for a line from Pwllheli, but abandoned it in 1892. In 1913 the company obtained powers for a rail extension to Porth Dinllaen, but World War I intervened and afterwards the idea lapsed.Baughan, page 162 The original Pwllheli station was on Abererch Road, stopping short of the inner harbour and the River Erch. In the mid-nineteenth century the harbour was busy with coal and agricultural products, but the railway dominated those traffics; reduced conservancy allowed silting of the inner harbour by material brought in by the River Erch. In 1903 improvement works were carried out to the Inner Harbour, and reclamation work was carried out; an embankment was constructed by Pwllheli Corporation. The location of the railway station was far from the centre of the town and the opportunity was taken to extend the line westwards to its present position at the Cob. This was authorised by a Cambrian Railways Act of 2 July 1901. On 19 July 1909 the extension to a new two-platform terminus was opened.Pwllheli Harbour, at History Points, https://historypoints.org/index.php?page=pwllheli-harbour Strengthening of Barmouth viaduct Gasquoine mentions strengthening works: > In 1899, the ironwork portion of [Barmouth] viaduct had become too weak for > the constantly increasing loads of developing traffic, [so] it was > completely renewed with a modern steel structure of four spans, one of which > was a swing span, revolving on the centre pier and giving two clear > openings. The piers carrying the girders are formed of columns 8ft. in > diameter sunk through the sand down to solid rock, which was reached at a > depth of about 90 feet below high water mark... In 1906, and the following > two or three years, the timber portion of the viaduct was also completely > renewed in the same material. Grouping of the Railways After World War I the Government decided to transfer most of the main line railways of Great Britain into one or other of four new large concerns, in a process referred to as the \\"grouping\\". The Cambrian Railways was to be a constituent of a new Great Western Railway, although the old GWR was to be the largest component of the new company, The transfer took effect on 1 January 1922, from which date the Cambrian Railways ceased to exist.Except for the winding up of financial affairs.Green, volume 2, page 19 After 1923 The layout at Aberystwyth was improved in 1925 with longer platforms taking up the land formerly used by a turntable. A triangle for locomotive turning was installed, using one of the Manchester and Milford sidings, but it was not possible to carry out through running to Carmarthen over the triangle. A new station frontage and a big increase in the area roofed over were the improvements most appreciated by passengers.Christiansen, volume 2, page 144Kidner, page 115 Aberdovey station, opened when the \\"deviation\\" line connecting to Dovey Junction was opened, was a great distance west of the town, and over decades there were complaints about this. In 1933 Penhelig Halt was opened, at the east end of the town but considerably more convenient.Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Machynlleth to Barmouth, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2009, , caption to plate V The last of a series of coast halts was opened at Llandecwyn in 1935. At Abererch, a conditional halt with double-arm platform signals for passengers to stop trains, became a full station. Penychain and Butlins Pwllheli to Bangor train at Afon Wen in 1962 Penychain Halt was opened on 31 July 1933, at first just a simple short platform. On the seaward side here Butlins built a large holiday camp in 1939, but just as it was being finished, it was taken over by the Royal Navy as \\"HMS Glendower\\". After the War some further work needed doing, and the holiday camp did not open until the 1947 season. The halt station was enlarged and a second platform was built, with brick waiting rooms and a wooden platform; the old halt platform was refurbished, and the line was doubled to Afon Wen, (commissioned on 3 April 1947) since most of the Butlins traffic would be coming via Bangor and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (successor to the Carnarvonshire Railway). The layout at Afon Wen was enhanced at this time, as the holiday trains reversed there. The running lines at Penychain were reversible. By the 1970s the camp station had fallen into disuse as most holidaymakers came by road.Kidner, page 133 After 1948 The railways of Great Britain were again reorganised by Government when in 1948 nationalisation of the system took place. The new owner was British Railways. In the 1960s the former A&WCR; network was under consideration for closure or significant reduction, as goods traffic declined steeply and passenger business too transferred to road transport. The threat of total closure was eventually averted, but the collapse of wagonload traffic in particular rendered most local goods facilities unnecessary. The national strike in the coalmining industry in 1983 also hastened a transfer away from traditional traffics. The Dolgelly line did succumb to closure. Trains from Barmouth to Ruabon did not run from 13 to 17 December 1965 due to floods east of Dolgellau. The Barmouth to Dolgelly section reopened, but finally closed from 18 January 1966.Kidner, page 178 A proposal to close the entire Coast line in 1971 was fought successfully by a pressure group. The Radio Electronic Token Block signalling system was installed over the weekend of 1 and 2 October 1988. Barmouth bridge and the shipworm Barmouth Bridge across the River Mawddach estuary near Barmouth, in 2007 On 13 October 1980, Barmouth bridge was closed to rail traffic when it was discovered that about three- quarters of the 500 timber trestle piles had been damaged at river bed level by the shipworm, teredo navalis, a marine borer. Extensive repairs were undertaken in the mid 1980s, including replacing 48 of the piles with greenheart hardwood and strengthening 330 more piles with cementitious resin grout and glass-reinforced concrete jackets. Rail services resumed when the viaduct re-opened in April 1986.Barmouth Viaduct at Engineering Timelines http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=1340 Barmouth viaduct Barmouth railway bridge Gasquoine described the viaduct as being: > Eight hundred yards in length, the greater portion was constructed on timber > piles, over 500 in number, in 113 spans, driven into the sand. The navigable > channel, at the Barmouth end, was crossed by an iron-work construction, of > seven fixed and one opening span. The latter was of the drawbridge type, and > when lifted at one end by means of large screws was carried on wheels and > could be drawn back over the adjoining span. C P Gasquoine, The Story of the Cambrian: A Biography of a Railway, Christopher Davies Publishers, Llandyibie, 1922, reprinted 1973, pages 85 to 87 Morfa Mawddach triangle There was a triangular layout at Morfa Mawddach where the Dolgelly line diverged from the main line to Pwllheli. The south curve was opened first, on 3 July 1865 as part of the direct route from Aberdovey to Dolgelly. The west and north curves were opened in 1867 as part of the main line to Barmouth, and at that time a station was then opened at the apex nearest Barmouth; it was named Barmouth Junction until 1960, when it was renamed Morfa Mawddach. No platform was ever built on the south curve; it was singled around 1900 and then used as a siding. The station originally had three platforms, two on the main line and one on the branch, but about 1890 a down platform on the Dolgellau line was added. There was also a bay platform at the end of the up Dolgellau platform, used from 1934 for camping coaches. As the Barmouth turntable would not take all types of engines working through from Dolgellau (which was less restricted than the main line) the triangle was sometimes used for turning engines.Kidner, page 125 Dolgelly Early train at the first A&WCR; Dolgelly station The A&WCR;'s Dolgelley branch had been authorised in 1862, and in the same session the Bala and Dolgelly Railway, in effect the Great Western Railway, was also approved. At the time no direction was given as to the lines connecting, but this was rectified in an Act of 21 July 1863, which mandated a joint station. The A&WCR; had reached Penmaenpool, two miles short, on 3 July 1865, and no progress was made for some time.Christiansen and Miller, page 79 The GWR line opened on 4 August 1868.Baughan, pages 142 and 143 On 11 June 1869, the Board of Trade Inspector passed the Cambrian extension from Penmaenpool to Dolgelly. Due to a delay in getting possession of land, the Cambrian Railways had to erect a temporary station at a point known as Frondirion (about half a mile west of the Great Western station), opening on 21 June 1869. The extension to Dolgelley GWR station was opened on 1 August 1869.Green, volume 2, page 8 There were two separate stations here until 1872.Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Ruabon to Barmouth, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2010, , Historical Background Mitchell and Smith show a fragment of a 1911 Ordnance Survey map; Dolgellau station has the appearance of a single station on a double track section of line, but the legend shows \\"Station (Great Western)\\" for the buildings on the northern platform, and \\"Station (Cambrian)\\" for the southern.Mitchell and Smith, map XXI Plate 92 shows the station and the caption states, \\"The canopy styles reflect the earlier different ownerships\\".Mitchell and Smith, plate 92 Manchester and Milford Railway The Manchester and Milford Railway built its ill-fated line from Pencader to Aberystwyth, opening there in August 1867, with platforms on the south-west side.Kidner, page 115 Accidents The cliff top line at Friog was the site of two almost identical accidents, in 1883 and 1933, in which the locomotive plunged to the foot of the cliff, leaving the bulk of the train remaining on the track. The locomotive crews were killed in both instances. The topography at this point is demanding, as the existing coast road at a higher level had to be accommodated, as well as a working mine. Current operations The majority of the line is open, except for the line between Morfa Mawddach and Dolgellau, which closed on 18 January 1965, and the Aberdovey Harbour and Ynyslas wharf branches. The ten-mile (16 km) section of the Dolgellau branch, alongside the southern shore of the Mawddach estuary, is now the Llwybr Mawddach (or \\"Mawddach Trail\\"), a cycle route and bridleway. This section of the line featured in the BBC's Railway Walks series with Julia Bradbury. Topography Station list Stations in bold are still open.

Physically, the MSD can be considered the amount of space the particle has \\"explored\\" in the system. An example of anomalous diffusion in nature is the subdiffusion that has been observed in the cell nucleus, plasma membrane and cytoplasm. Unlike typical diffusion, anomalous diffusion is described by a power law, œÉr2 ~ DtŒ±, where D is the diffusion coefficient and t is the elapsed time. In a typical diffusion process, Œ± = 1. If Œ± > 1, the phenomenon is called super-diffusion. Super-diffusion can be the result of active cellular transport processes. If Œ± < 1, the particle undergoes sub- diffusion. The role of anomalous diffusion has received attention within the literature to describe many physical scenarios, most prominently within crowded systems, for example protein diffusion within cells, or diffusion through porous media. Sub-diffusion has been proposed as a measure of macromolecular crowding in the cytoplasm. It has been found that equations describing normal diffusion are not capable of characterizing some complex diffusion processes, for instance, diffusion process in inhomogeneous or heterogeneous medium, e.g. porous media. Fractional diffusion equations were introduced in order to characterize anomalous diffusion phenomena. Recently, anomalous diffusion was found in several systems including ultra-cold atoms, scalar mixing in the interstellar medium, telomeres in the nucleus of cells, ion channels in the plasma membrane, colloidal particle in the cytoplasm, moisture transport in cement-based materials, and worm-like micellar solutions. Anomalous diffusion was also found in other biological systems, including heartbeat intervals and in DNA sequences. The daily fluctuations of climate variables such as temperature can be regarded as steps of a random walker or diffusion and have been found to be anomalous. In 1926, using weather balloons, Lewis Richardson demonstrated that the atmosphere exhibits super-diffusion. In a bounded system, the mixing length (which determines the scale of dominant mixing motions) is given by the Von K√°rm√°n constant according to the equation l_m={\\\\kappa}z, where l_m is the mixing length, {\\\\kappa} is the Von K√°rm√°n constant, and z is the distance to the nearest boundary. Because the scale of motions in the atmosphere is not limited, as in rivers or the subsurface, a plume continues to experience larger mixing motions as it increases in size, which also increases its diffusivity, resulting in super-diffusion.  Types of Anomalous diffusion  Of interest within the scientific community, when an anomalous-type diffusion process is discovered, the challenge is to understand the underlying mechanism which causes it. There are a number of frameworks which give rise to anomalous diffusion that are currently in vogue within the statistical physics community. These are long range correlations between the signals continuous- time random walks (CTRW ) and fractional Brownian motion (fBm), diffusion of colloidal particles in bacterial suspensions, and diffusion in disordered media. Anomalous subdiffusion in cellular cytosol can be an artifact resulting from using of polydisperse probes for measurements. Hyper-ballistic diffusion One important class of anomalous diffusion refers to the case when the scaling exponent of the MSD increases with value greater than 2. Such case is called hyper-ballistic diffusion and it has been observed in optical systems.

It is just one of a number of such possible extensions. Given a hypersurface X \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{P}^n defined by a degree d polynomial F and a rational n-form \\\\omega on \\\\mathbb{P}^n with a pole of order k > 0 on X, then we can construct a cohomology class \\\\operatorname{Res}(\\\\omega) \\\\in H^{n-1}(X;\\\\mathbb{C}). If n=1 we recover the classical residue construction.  Historical construction  When Poincar√© first introduced residues he was studying period integrals of the form > \\\\underset{\\\\Gamma}\\\\iint \\\\omega for \\\\Gamma \\\\in H_2(\\\\mathbb{P}^2 - D) where \\\\omega was a rational differential form with poles along a divisor D. He was able to make the reduction of this integral to an integral of the form > \\\\int_\\\\gamma \\\\text{Res}(\\\\omega) for \\\\gamma \\\\in H_1(D) where \\\\Gamma = T(\\\\gamma), sending \\\\gamma to the boundary of a solid \\\\varepsilon-tube around \\\\gamma on the smooth locus D^*of the divisor. If > \\\\omega = \\\\frac{q(x,y)dx\\\\wedge dy}{p(x,y)} on an affine chart where p(x,y) is irreducible of degree N and \\\\deg q(x,y) \\\\leq N-3 (so there is no poles on the line at infinity page 150). Then, he gave a formula for computing this residue as > \\\\text{Res}(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{qdx}{\\\\partial f / \\\\partial y} = > \\\\frac{qdy}{\\\\partial f / \\\\partial x} which are both cohomologous forms.  Construction   Preliminary definition  Given the setup in the introduction, let A^p_k(X) be the space of meromorphic p-forms on \\\\mathbb{P}^n which have poles of order up to k. Notice that the standard differential d sends :d: A^{p-1}_{k-1}(X) \\\\to A^p_k(X) Define :\\\\mathcal{K}_k(X) = \\\\frac{A^p_k(X)}{dA^{p-1}_{k-1}(X)} as the rational de-Rham cohomology groups. They form a filtration > \\\\mathcal{K}_1(X) \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{K}_2(X) \\\\subset \\\\cdots \\\\subset > \\\\mathcal{K}_n(X) = H^{n+1}(\\\\mathbb{P}^{n+1}-X) corresponding to the Hodge filtration.  Definition of residue  Consider an (n-1)-cycle \\\\gamma \\\\in H_{n-1}(X;\\\\mathbb{C}). We take a tube T(\\\\gamma) around \\\\gamma (which is locally isomorphic to \\\\gamma\\\\times S^1) that lies within the complement of X. Since this is an n-cycle, we can integrate a rational n-form \\\\omega and get a number. If we write this as :\\\\int_{T(-)}\\\\omega : H_{n-1}(X;\\\\mathbb{C}) \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} then we get a linear transformation on the homology classes. Homology/cohomology duality implies that this is a cohomology class :\\\\operatorname{Res}(\\\\omega) \\\\in H^{n-1}(X;\\\\mathbb{C}) which we call the residue. Notice if we restrict to the case n=1, this is just the standard residue from complex analysis (although we extend our meromorphic 1-form to all of \\\\mathbb{P}^1. This definition can be summarized as the map > \\\\text{Res}: H^{n+1}(\\\\mathbb{P}^{n+1}\\\\setminus X) \\\\to H^n(X)  Algorithm for computing this class  There is a simple recursive method for computing the residues which reduces to the classical case of n=1. Recall that the residue of a 1-form : \\\\operatorname{Res}\\\\left(\\\\frac{dz} z + a\\\\right) = 1 If we consider a chart containing X where it is the vanishing locus of w, we can write a meromorphic n-form with pole on X as :\\\\frac{dw}{w^k}\\\\wedge \\\\rho Then we can write it out as : \\\\frac{1}{(k-1)}\\\\left( \\\\frac{d\\\\rho}{w^{k-1}} + d\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{w^{k-1}}\\\\right) \\\\right) This shows that the two cohomology classes :\\\\left[ \\\\frac{dw}{w^k}\\\\wedge \\\\rho \\\\right] = \\\\left[ \\\\frac{d\\\\rho}{(k-1)w^{k-1}} \\\\right] are equal. We have thus reduced the order of the pole hence we can use recursion to get a pole of order 1 and define the residue of \\\\omega as : \\\\operatorname{Res}\\\\left( \\\\alpha \\\\wedge \\\\frac{dw} w + \\\\beta \\\\right) = \\\\alpha|_X  Example  For example, consider the curve X \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{P}^2 defined by the polynomial :F_t(x,y,z) = t(x^3 + y^3 + z^3) - 3xyz Then, we can apply the previous algorithm to compute the residue of :\\\\omega = \\\\frac{\\\\Omega}{F_t} = \\\\frac{x\\\\,dy\\\\wedge dz - y \\\\, dx\\\\wedge dz + z \\\\, dx\\\\wedge dy}{t(x^3 + y^3 + z^3) - 3xyz} Since : \\\\begin{align} -z\\\\,dy\\\\wedge\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_t}{\\\\partial x} \\\\, dx + \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_t}{\\\\partial y} \\\\, dy + \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_t}{\\\\partial z} \\\\, dz \\\\right) &=z\\\\frac{\\\\partial F_t}{\\\\partial x} \\\\, dx\\\\wedge dy - z \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_t}{\\\\partial z} \\\\, dy\\\\wedge dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\, dz\\\\wedge\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial F_t}{\\\\partial x} \\\\, dx + \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_t}{\\\\partial y} \\\\, dy + \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_t}{\\\\partial z} \\\\, dz\\\\right) &= -y\\\\frac{\\\\partial F_t}{\\\\partial x} \\\\, dx\\\\wedge dz - y \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_t}{\\\\partial y} \\\\, dy\\\\wedge dz \\\\end{align} and : 3F_t - z\\\\frac{\\\\partial F_t}{\\\\partial x} - y\\\\frac{\\\\partial F_t}{\\\\partial y} = x \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_t}{\\\\partial x} we have that : \\\\omega = \\\\frac{y\\\\,dz - z\\\\,dy}{\\\\partial F_t / \\\\partial x} \\\\wedge \\\\frac{dF_t}{F_t} + \\\\frac{3\\\\,dy\\\\wedge dz}{\\\\partial F_t/\\\\partial x} This implies that :\\\\operatorname{Res}(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{y\\\\,dz - z\\\\,dy}{\\\\partial F_t / \\\\partial x} See also * Grothendieck residue * Leray residue * Bott residue * Sheaf of logarithmic differential forms * normal crossing singularity *Adjunction formula#Poincare residue *Hodge structure *Jacobian ideal References Introductory * Poincar√© and algebraic geometry *Infinitesimal variations of Hodge structure and the global Torelli problem - Page 7 contains general computation formula using Cech cohomology Higher Dimensional Residues - Mathoverflow Advanced  References *Boris A.

Allies during World War II, the US and the USSR became competitors on the world stage and engaged in the Cold War, so called because it never resulted in overt, declared total war between the two powers but was instead characterized by espionage, political subversion and proxy wars. Western Europe and Japan were rebuilt through the American Marshall Plan whereas Central and Eastern Europe fell under the Soviet sphere of influence and eventually behind an \\"Iron Curtain\\". Europe was divided into a US-led Western Bloc and a Soviet-led Eastern Bloc. Internationally, alliances with the two blocs gradually shifted, with some nations trying to stay out of the Cold War through the Non-Aligned Movement. The War also saw a nuclear arms race between the two superpowers; part of the reason that the Cold War never became a \\"hot\\" war was that the Soviet Union and the United States had nuclear deterrents against each other, leading to a mutually assured destruction standoff. As a consequence of the war, the Allies created the United Nations, an organization for international cooperation and diplomacy, similar to the League of Nations. Members of the United Nations agreed to outlaw wars of aggression in an attempt to avoid a third world war. The devastated great powers of Western Europe formed the European Coal and Steel Community, which later evolved into the European Economic Community and ultimately into the current European Union. This effort primarily began as an attempt to avoid another war between Germany and France by economic cooperation and integration, and a common market for important natural resources. The end of the war also increased the rate of decolonization from the great powers with independence being granted to India (from the United Kingdom), Indonesia (from the Netherlands), the Philippines (from the US) and a number of Arab nations, primarily from specific rights which had been granted to great powers from League of Nations Mandates in the post World War I-era but often having existed de facto well before this time. Independence for the nations of Sub- Saharan Africa came more slowly. The aftermath of World War II also saw the rise of communist influence in Southeast Asia, with the People's Republic of China, as the Chinese Communist Party emerged victorious from the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Immediate effects Warsaw, Poland: Result of the war. At the end of the war, millions of people were dead and millions more homeless, the European economy had collapsed, and much of the European industrial infrastructure had been destroyed. The Soviet Union, too, had been heavily affected. In response, in 1947, U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall devised the \\"European Recovery Program\\", which became known as the Marshall Plan. Under the plan, during 1948‚Äì1952 the United States government allocated US$13 billion (US$ billion in dollars) for the reconstruction of the affected countries of Western Europe. United Kingdom By the end of the war, the economy of the United Kingdom was one of severe privation. More than a quarter of its national wealth had been consumed. Until the introduction in 1941 of Lend-Lease aid from the US, the UK had been spending its assets to purchase American equipment including aircraft and ships‚Äîover ¬£437 million on aircraft alone. Lend-lease came just before its reserves were exhausted. Britain had placed 55% of its total labour force into war production. In spring 1945, the Labour Party withdrew from the wartime coalition government, in an effort to oust Winston Churchill, forcing a general election. Following a landslide victory, Labour held more than 60% of the seats in the House of Commons and formed a new government on 26 July 1945 under Clement Attlee. Britain's war debt was described by some in the American administration as a \\"millstone round the neck of the British economy\\". Although there were suggestions for an international conference to tackle the issue, in August 1945 the U.S. announced unexpectedly that the Lend-Lease programme was to end immediately. The abrupt withdrawal of American Lend-Lease support to Britain on 2 September 1945 dealt a severe blow to the plans of the new government. It was only with the completion of the Anglo-American loan by the United States to Great Britain on 15 July 1946 that some measure of economic stability was restored. However, the loan was made primarily to support British overseas expenditure in the immediate post-war years and not to implement the Labour government's policies for domestic welfare reforms and the nationalisation of key industries. Although the loan was agreed on reasonable terms, its conditions included what proved to be damaging fiscal conditions for Sterling. From 1946-1948, the UK introduced bread rationing, which it had never done during the war.The Dominance of England, Dorothy Crisp, Holborn Publishing, London 1960, pages 22-26,The World at War, Mark Arnold-Foster, BCA London, 1974, pages 286-7,Sunday Times Sept 6, 2009 by Max HastingsA History of the American People, Paul Johnson, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1997, pages 647-8 Soviet Union Ruins in Stalingrad, typical of the destruction in many Soviet cities. The Soviet Union suffered enormous losses in the war against Germany. The Soviet population decreased by about 27 million during the war; of these, 8.7 million were combat deaths. The 19 million non-combat deaths had a variety of causes: starvation in the siege of Leningrad; conditions in German prisons and concentration camps; mass shootings of civilians; harsh labour in German industry; famine and disease; conditions in Soviet camps; and service in German or German-controlled military units fighting the Soviet Union.Michael Ellman and S. Maksudov, \\"Soviet Deaths in the Great Patriotic War: A Note\\", Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 46, No. 4, pp. 671-680 The population would not return to its pre-war level for 30 years.\\"20m Soviet war dead may be underestimate\\", Guardian, 30 April 1994 quoting Professor John Erickson of Edinburgh University, Defence Studies. Soviet ex-POWs and civilians repatriated from abroad were suspected of having been Nazi collaborators, and 226,127 of them were sent to forced labour camps after scrutiny by Soviet intelligence, NKVD. Many ex-POWs and young civilians were also conscripted to serve in the Red Army. Others worked in labour battalions to rebuild infrastructure destroyed during the war.Edwin Bacon, \\"Glasnost and the Gulag: New Information on Soviet Forced Labour around World War II\\", Soviet Studies, Vol. 44, No. 6 (1992), pp. 1069-1086.Michael Ellman, \\"Soviet Repression Statistics: Some Comments\\", Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 54, No. 7 (Nov., 2002), pp. 1151-1172 World War II casualties The economy had been devastated. Roughly a quarter of the Soviet Union's capital resources were destroyed, and industrial and agricultural output in 1945 fell far short of pre-war levels. To help rebuild the country, the Soviet government obtained limited credits from Britain and Sweden; it refused assistance offered by the United States under the Marshall Plan. Instead, the Soviet Union coerced Soviet-occupied Central and Eastern Europe to supply machinery and raw materials. Germany and former Nazi satellites made reparations to the Soviet Union. The reconstruction programme emphasised heavy industry to the detriment of agriculture and consumer goods. By 1953, steel production was twice its 1940 level, but the production of many consumer goods and foodstuffs was lower than it had been in the late 1920s.Glenn E. Curtis, ed.

Yugoslavia emerged as an independent Communist state allied but not aligned with the Soviet Union, owing to the independent nature of the military victory of the Partisans of Josip Broz Tito during World War II in Yugoslavia. The Allies established the Far Eastern Commission and Allied Council for Japan to administer their occupation of that country while the establishment Allied Control Council, administered occupied Germany. In accordance with the Potsdam Conference agreements, the Soviet Union occupied and subsequently annexed the strategic island of Sakhalin. Germany occupation zones of Germany, in its 1937 borders, with territories east of the Oder-Neisse line shown as annexed by Poland and the Soviet Union, plus the Saar protectorate and divided Berlin. East Germany was formed by the Soviet Zone, while West Germany was formed by the American, British, and French zones in 1949 and the Saar in 1957. In Germany, in the west, Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France. In the east, the Sudetenland reverted to Czechoslovakia following the European Advisory Commission's decision to delimit German territory to be the territory it held on 31 December 1937. Close to one- quarter of pre-war (1937) Germany was de facto annexed by the Allies; roughly 10 million Germans were either expelled from this territory or not permitted to return to it if they had fled during the war. The remainder of Germany was partitioned into four zones of occupation, coordinated by the Allied Control Council. The Saar was detached and put in economic union with France in 1947. In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was created out of the Western zones. The Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic. Germany paid reparations to the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, mainly in the form of dismantled factories, forced labour, and coal. The German standard of living was to be reduced to its 1932 level.Cost of Defeat Time Magazine Monday, 8 April 1946 Beginning immediately after the German surrender and continuing for the next two years, the US and Britain pursued an \\"intellectual reparations\\" programme to harvest all technological and scientific know-how as well as all patents in Germany. The value of these amounted to around US$10 billion (US$ billion in dollars). In accordance with the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947, reparations were also assessed from the countries of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. The hunger-winter of 1947. Thousands protest against the disastrous food situation. Sign says \\"we want coal. we want bread.\\" (31 March 1947). US policy in post-war Germany from April 1945 until July 1947 had been that no help should be given to the Germans in rebuilding their nation, save for the minimum required to mitigate starvation. The Allies' immediate post-war \\"industrial disarmament\\" plan for Germany had been to destroy Germany's capability to wage war by complete or partial de- industrialization. The first industrial plan for Germany, signed in 1946, required the destruction of 1,500 manufacturing plants to lower German heavy industry output to roughly 50% of its 1938 level. Dismantling of West German industry ended in 1951. By 1950, equipment had been removed from 706 manufacturing plants, and steel production capacity had been reduced by 6.7 million tons.Frederick H. Gareau \\"Morgenthau's Plan for Industrial Disarmament in Germany\\" The Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 14, No. 2 (Jun., 1961), pp. 517-534 After lobbying by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Generals Lucius D. Clay and George Marshall, the Truman administration accepted that economic recovery in Europe could not go forward without the reconstruction of the German industrial base on which it had previously been dependent.Ray Salvatore Jennings \\"The Road Ahead: Lessons in Nation Building from Japan, Germany, and Afghanistan for Postwar Iraq \\" May 2003, Peaceworks No. 49 pg.15 In July 1947, President Truman rescinded on \\"national security grounds\\"Ray Salvatore Jennings \\"The Road Ahead: Lessons in Nation Building from Japan, Germany, and Afghanistan for Postwar Iraq May 2003, Peaceworks No. 49 p.15 the directive that had ordered the US occupation forces to \\"take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany.\\" A new directive recognised that \\"[a]n orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.\\"Pas de Pagaille! Time Magazine 28 July 1947. From mid-1946 onwards Germany received US government aid through the GARIOA programme. From 1948 onwards West Germany also became a minor beneficiary of the Marshall Plan. Volunteer organisations had initially been forbidden to send food, but in early 1946 the Council of Relief Agencies Licensed to Operate in Germany was founded. The prohibition against sending CARE Packages to individuals in Germany was rescinded on 5 June 1946. After the German surrender, the International Red Cross was prohibited from providing aid such as food or visiting POW camps for Germans inside Germany. However, after making approaches to the Allies in the autumn of 1945 it was allowed to investigate the camps in the UK and French occupation zones of Germany, as well as to provide relief to the prisoners held there. On 4 February 1946, the Red Cross was also permitted to visit and assist prisoners in the U.S. occupation zone of Germany, although only with very small quantities of food. The Red Cross petitioned successfully for improvements to be made in the living conditions of German POWs.Staff. ICRC in WW II: German prisoners of war in Allied hands, 2 February 2005 France As France was liberated from German occupation, an √©puration (purge) of real and suspected Nazi collaborators began. At first this was undertaken in an extralegal manner by the French Resistance (called the √©puration sauvage, \\"wild purge\\"). French women who had had romantic liaisons with German soldiers were publicly humiliated and had their heads shaved. There were also a wave of summary executions estimated to have killed about 10,000 people. When the Provisional Government of the French Republic established control, the √âpuration l√©gale (\\"legal purge\\") began. There were no international war crimes trials for French collaborators, who were tried in the domestic courts. Approximately 300,000 cases were investigated; 120,000 people were given various sentences including 6,763 death sentences (of which only 791 were carried out). Most convicts were given amnesty a few years later. Italy The 1947 Treaty of Peace with Italy spelled the end of the Italian colonial empire, along with other border revisions. The 1947 Paris Peace Treaties compelled Italy to pay $360 million (US dollars at 1938 prices) in war reparations: $125 million to Yugoslavia, $105 million to Greece, $100 million to the Soviet Union, $25 million to Ethiopia and $5 million to Albania. In the 1946 Italian constitutional referendum the Italian monarchy was abolished, having been associated with the deprivations of the war and the Fascist rule, especially in the North. Unlike in Germany and Japan, no war crimes tribunals were held against Italian military and political leaders, though the Italian resistance summarily executed some of them (such as Mussolini) at the end of the war; the Togliatti amnesty, taking its name from the Communist Party secretary at the time, pardoned all wartime common and political crimes in 1946. Austria The Federal State of Austria had been annexed by Germany in 1938 (Anschluss, this union was banned by the Treaty of Versailles). Austria (called Ostmark by the Germans) was separated from Germany and divided into four zones of occupation. With the Austrian State Treaty, these zones reunited in 1955 to become the Republic of Austria. Japan The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands in Micronesia administered by the United States from 1947 to 1986 Silent film footage taken in Hiroshima in March 1946 showing survivors with severe burns and keloid scars. After the war, the Allies rescinded Japanese pre-war annexations such as Manchuria, and Korea became independent. The Philippines and Guam were returned to the United States. Burma, Malaya, and Singapore were returned to Britain and French Indo-China back to France. The Dutch East Indies was to be handed back to the Dutch but was resisted leading to the Indonesian war for independence. At the Yalta Conference, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt had secretly traded the Japanese Kurils and south Sakhalin to the Soviet Union in return for Soviet entry in the war with Japan.Time Magazine, FOREIGN RELATIONS: Secret of the Kurils, Monday, 11 February 1946 URL The Soviet Union annexed the Kuril Islands, provoking the Kuril Islands dispute, which is ongoing, as Russia continues to occupy the islands. Hundreds of thousands of Japanese were forced to relocate to the Japanese main islands. Okinawa became a main US staging point. The US covered large areas of it with military bases and continued to occupy it until 1972, years after the end of the occupation of the main islands. The bases still remain. To skirt the Geneva Convention, the Allies classified many Japanese soldiers as Japanese Surrendered Personnel instead of POWs and used them as forced labour until 1947. The UK, France, and the Netherlands conscripted some Japanese troops to fight colonial resistances elsewhere in Asia. General Douglas MacArthur established the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. The Allies collected reparations from Japan. To further remove Japan as a potential future military threat, the Far Eastern Commission decided to de-industrialise Japan, with the goal of reducing Japanese standard of living to what prevailed between 1930 and 1934.Frederick H. Gareau \\"Morgenthau's Plan for Industrial Disarmament in Germany\\" The Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 14, No. 2 (Jun., 1961), pp. 531(Note: A footnote in Gareau also states: \\"For a text of this decision, see Activities of the Far Eastern Commission. Report of the Secretary General, February 1946 to July 10, 1947, Appendix 30, p. 85.\\") In the end, the de- industrialisation programme in Japan was implemented to a lesser degree than the one in Germany. Japan received emergency aid from GARIOA, as did Germany. In early 1946, the Licensed Agencies for Relief in Asia were formed and permitted to supply Japanese with food and clothes. In April 1948 the Johnston Committee Report recommended that the economy of Japan should be reconstructed due to the high cost to US taxpayers of continuous emergency aid. Survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, known as hibakusha (Ë¢´ÁàÜËÄÖ), were ostracized by Japanese society. Japan provided no special assistance to these people until 1952.\\"Japan and North America: First contacts to the Pacific War\\", Ellis S. Krauss, Benjamin Nyblade, 2004, pg. 351 By the 65th anniversary of the bombings, total casualties from the initial attack and later deaths reached about 270,000 in Hiroshima and 150,000 in Nagasaki. About 230,000 hibakusha were still alive , and about 2,200 were suffering from radiation- caused illnesses . Finland In the Winter War of 1939‚Äì1940, the Soviet Union invaded neutral Finland and annexed some of its territory. From 1941 until 1944, Finland aligned itself with Nazi Germany in a failed effort to regain lost territories from the Soviets. Finland retained its independence following the war but remained subject to Soviet-imposed constraints in its domestic affairs. The Baltic states In 1940 the Soviet Union invaded and annexed the neutral Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. In June 1941, the Soviet governments of the Baltic states carried out mass deportations of \\"enemies of the people\\"; as a result, many treated the invading Nazis as liberators when they invaded only a week later. The Atlantic Charter promised self-determination to people deprived of it during the war. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, argued for a weaker interpretation of the Charter to permit the Soviet Union to continue to control the Baltic states.Roger S. Whitcomb, \\"The Cold War in retrospect: the formative years,\\" p. 18 \\"Churchill suggested that the principles of the Atlantic Charter ought not be construed so as to deny Russia the frontier occupied when Germany attacked in 1941.\\" Google Books In March 1944 the U.S. accepted Churchill's view that the Atlantic Charter did not apply to the Baltic states.Roger S. Whitcomb, \\"The Cold War in retrospect: the formative years,\\" p. 18 With the return of Soviet troops at the end of the war, the Forest Brothers mounted a guerrilla war. This continued until the mid-1950s. The Philippines An estimated one million military and civilian Filipinos were killed from all causes; of these 131,028 were listed as killed in seventy-two war crime events. According to a United States analysis released years after the war, U.S. casualties were 10,380 dead and 36,550 wounded; Japanese dead were 255,795. Population displacement Expulsion of Germans from the Sudetenland As a result of the new borders drawn by the victorious nations, large populations suddenly found themselves in hostile territory. The Soviet Union took over areas formerly controlled by Germany, Finland, Poland, and Japan. Poland lost the Kresy region (about half of its pre-War territory) and received most of Germany east of the Oder-Neisse line, including the industrial regions of Silesia. The German state of the Saar was temporarily a protectorate of France but later returned to German administration. As set forth at Potsdam, approximately 12 million people were expelled from Germany, including seven million from Germany proper, and three million from the Sudetenland. During the war, the United States government interned approximately 110,000 Japanese Americans and Japanese who lived along the Pacific coast of the United States in the wake of Imperial Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.National Park Service. Manzanar National Historic SiteVarious primary and secondary sources list counts between persons. Canada interned approximately 22,000 Japanese Canadians, 14,000 of whom were born in Canada. After the war, some internees chose to return to Japan, while most remained in North America. Poland The Soviet Union expelled at least 2 million Poles from east of the new border approximating the Curzon Line. This estimate is uncertain as both the Polish Communist government and the Soviet government did not keep track of the number of expelled. The number of Polish citizens inhabiting Polish borderlands (Kresy region) was about 13 million before World War II broke out according to official Polish statistics. Polish citizens killed in the war that originated from the Polish borderlands territory (killed by both German Nazi regime and the Soviet regime or expelled to distant parts of Siberia) were accounted as Russian, Ukrainian or Belarusian casualties of war in official Soviet historiography. This fact imposes additional difficulties in making the correct estimation of the number of Polish citizens forcibly transferred after the war.Norman Davies, God's Playground, a History of Poland, Columbia University Press, 1982, , p.558 The border change also reversed the results of the 1919-1920 Polish-Soviet War. Former Polish cities such as Lw√≥w came under control of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Additionally, the Soviet Union transferred more than two million people within their own borders; these included Germans, Finns, Crimean Tatars, and Chechens. Rape during occupation In Europe As Soviet troops marched across the Balkans, they committed rapes and robberies in Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. The population of Bulgaria was largely spared this treatment, due possibly to a sense of ethnic kinship or to the leadership of Marshal Fyodor Tolbukhin. The population of Germany was treated significantly worse. Rape and murder of German civilians was as bad as, and sometimes worse than, Nazi propaganda had anticipated.West Germany under construction: politics, society, and culture in the Adenauer era\\", Robert G.

Over 4.5 million Germans fled towards the West.The Miracle Years: A Cultural History of West Germany, 1949-1968 Hanna Schissler, Princeton University Press, 2001, p.27 The Soviets initially had no rules against their troops \\"fraternising\\" with German women, but by 1947 they started to isolate their troops from the German population in an attempt to stop rape and robbery by the troops. Not all Soviet soldiers participated in these activities. Foreign reports of Soviet brutality were denounced as false. Rape, robbery, and murder were blamed on German bandits impersonating Soviet soldiers. Some justified Soviet brutality towards German civilians based on previous brutality of German troops toward Russian civilians. Until the reunification of Germany, East German histories virtually ignored the actions of Soviet troops, and Russian histories still tend to do so. Reports of mass rapes by Soviet troops were often dismissed as anti-Communist propaganda or the normal byproduct of war.West Germany under construction: politics, society, and culture in the Adenauer era\\", Robert G. Moeller, Univ. of Michigan Press, 1997, p.35 Rapes also occurred under other occupation forces, though the majority were committed by Soviet troops. In a letter to the editor of TIME published in September 1945, an American army sergeant wrote, \\"Our own Army and the British Army along with ours have done their share of looting and raping... This offensive attitude among our troops is not at all general, but the percentage is large enough to have given our Army a pretty black name, and we too are considered an army of rapists.\\"Dear editor: letters to Time magazine, 1923-1984 \\", Phil Pearman, Salem House, 1985, p.75 Robert Lilly's analysis of military records led him to conclude about 14,000 rapes occurred in Britain, France, and Germany at the hands of US soldiers between 1942 and 1945.Politicization of sexual violence: from abolitionism to peacekeeping\\", Carol Harrington, Ashgate Pub., 2010, p.80 Lilly assumed that only 5% of rapes by American soldiers were reported, making 17,000 GI rapes a possibility, while analysts estimate that 50% of (ordinary peacetime) rapes are reported. Supporting Lilly's lower figure is the \\"crucial difference\\" that for World War II military rapes \\"it was the commanding officer, not the victim, who brought charges\\". According to German historian Miriam Gebhardt, as many as 190,000 women were raped by U.S. soldiers in Germany. German soldiers left many war children behind in nations such as France and Denmark, which were occupied for an extended period. After the war, the children and their mothers often suffered recriminations. In Norway, the \\"Tyskerunger\\" (German-kids) suffered greatly. During the Italian campaign, the Goumiers, French Moroccan colonial troops attached to the French Expeditionary Forces, have been accused of committing rape and murder against the Italian peasant communities, mostly targeting civilian women and girls, as well as a few men and boys. In Italy the victims of these acts were described as Marocchinate meaning literally \\"Moroccaned\\" (or people who have been subjected to acts committed by Moroccans). According to Italian victims associations, a total of more than 7,000 civilians, including children, were raped by Goumiers. In Japan In the first few weeks of the American military occupation of Japan, rape and other violent crime was widespread in naval ports like Yokohama and Yokosuka but declined shortly afterward. There were 1,336 reported rapes during the first 10 days of the occupation of Kanagawa prefecture.Molasky, Michael S; Rabson, Steve (2000), Southern Exposure: Modern Japanese Literature from Okinawa, University of Hawaii Press, p. 16,22,121 Historian Toshiyuki Tanaka relates that in Yokohama, the capital of the prefecture, there were 119 known rapes in September 1945.Tanaka, Yuki; Tanaka, Toshiyuki (2003), Japan's Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery and Prostitution During World War II, Routledge, Historians Eiji Takemae and Robert Ricketts state that \\"When US paratroopers landed in Sapporo, an orgy of looting, sexual violence, and drunken brawling ensued. Gang rapes and other sex atrocities were not infrequent\\" and some of the rape victims committed suicide.Takemae, Eiji; Robert Ricketts (2003). Inside GHQ: The Allied Occupation of Japan and Its Legacy. trans. Robert Ricketts, Sebastian Swann. Continuum International. p. 67. . General Robert L. Eichelberger, the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, recorded that in the one instance when the Japanese formed a self-help vigilante guard to protect women from off-duty GIs, the Eighth Army ordered armored vehicles in battle array into the streets and arrested the leaders, and the leaders received long prison terms.Svoboda, Terese. \\"U.S. Courts-Martial in Occupation Japan: Rape, Race, and Censorship\\". The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus. Retrieved 2013-05-20. According to Takemae and Ricketts, members of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) were also involved in rapes: Rape committed by U.S. soldiers occupying Okinawa was also a notable phenomenon. Okinawan historian Oshiro Masayasu (former director of the Okinawa Prefectural Historical Archives) writes: According to Toshiyuki Tanaka, 76 cases of rape or rape-murder were reported during the first five years of the American occupation of Okinawa. However, he claims this is probably not the true figure, as most cases were unreported.Tanaka, Yuki; Tanaka, Toshiyuki (2003), Japan's Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery and Prostitution During World War II, Routledge, p.112  Brief Overview of Post-war Latin America  One of the largest changes post-war was the global shift in those nations of authority. European influence in the Americas, Africa, and Asia diminished significantly, and only some of them managed to hold onto their colonial outposts, such as; Great Britain, France, and the Netherlands. While the United States was considered one of two of the largest military and political powers after World War II, it did not show interest in colonizing with the exception of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. However, it did not hesitate to enforce its military strength; if there were protests from local governments asking for higher wages and better working conditions from US firms that have bases in Latin America, Washington would step in and destabilize the current government in order to establish one that was more compliant to its desires. The increased industrialization in Latin America led to a need for a more educated workforce who knew how to operate the new machinery. This led to a previously unprecedented number of people attending schools for higher education when previously citizens rarely completed secondary school. Large numbers of women went on to pursue higher education for the first time, and this gave more opportunity for women in professions and employment in general outside of the home. Universities also grew, and this led to a more progressive and left- leaning institutional setting; a larger number of people going to higher education led to a larger amount of the population being aware of and willing to challenge inequalities in society and were preoccupied with social justice and improving the infrastructure and government bureaucracy so it would serve all instead of a select privileged few. These progressions managed to bring to light that while the middle class population was increasing, prosperity was absent from poor areas, both urban and rural, and this led to subsistence living or crowding into makeshift settlements on the outskirts of cities and towns. Often, such as in the Rocinha favela near Rio de Janeiro's South Zone, these poor settlements were placed directly adjacent to more wealthy residences, which emphasizes even more clearly how disproportionate these two class groups were, and still are today. Post-war tensions Europe Central-Eastern European borders and creation of the Communist Eastern bloc after World War II The alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union began to deteriorate even before the war was over, when Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill exchanged a heated correspondence over whether the Polish government-in-exile, backed by Roosevelt and Churchill, or the Provisional Government, backed by Stalin, should be recognised. Stalin won.Stewart Richardson, Secret History of World War II, New York: Richardson & Steirman, 1986, p.vi. A number of allied leaders felt that war between the United States and the Soviet Union was likely. On 19 May 1945, American Under- Secretary of State Joseph Grew went so far as to say that it was inevitable.Yefim Chernyak and Vic Schneierson, Ambient Conflicts: History of Relations between Countries with Different Social Systems, , Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1987, p. 360 On 5 March 1946, in his \\"Sinews of Peace\\" (Iron Curtain) speech at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, Winston Churchill said \\"a shadow\\" had fallen over Europe. He described Stalin as having dropped an \\"Iron Curtain\\" between East and West. Stalin responded by charging that co- existence between communist countries and the West was impossible.Anthony Cave Brown, Dropshot: The United States Plan for War with the Soviet Union in 1957, New York: Dial Press, 1978, p.3 In mid-1948 the Soviet Union imposed a blockade on the Western zone of occupation in Berlin. Due to the rising tension in Europe and concerns over further Soviet expansion, American planners came up with a contingency plan code-named Operation Dropshot in 1949. It considered possible nuclear and conventional war with the Soviet Union and its allies in order to counter a Soviet takeover of Western Europe, the Near East and parts of Eastern Asia that they anticipated would begin around 1957. In response, the US would saturate the Soviet Union with atomic and high-explosive bombs, and then invade and occupy the country.Cave Brown, op cit, p. 169 In later years, to reduce military expenditures while countering Soviet conventional strength, President Dwight Eisenhower would adopt a strategy of massive retaliation, relying on the threat of a US nuclear strike to prevent non-nuclear incursions by the Soviet Union in Europe and elsewhere. The approach entailed a major buildup of US nuclear forces and a corresponding reduction in America's non-nuclear ground and naval strength.John Lewis Gaddis, Strategies of Continment, New York: Oxford University Press, pp.127-9Walter LaFeber, America, Russia and the Cold War 1945-1966, New York: John Wiley, 1968, pp.123-200 The Soviet Union viewed these developments as \\"atomic blackmail\\".Chernyak, op cit, p.359 In Greece, civil war broke out in 1946 between Anglo-American-supported royalist forces and communist-led forces, with the royalist forces emerging as the victors.Christopher M Woodhouse, The Struggle for Greece 1941-1949, London: Hart-Davis 1976, pp.3-34, 76-7 The US launched a massive programme of military and economic aid to Greece and to neighbouring Turkey, arising from a fear that the Soviet Union stood on the verge of breaking through the NATO defence line to the oil-rich Middle East. On 12 March 1947, to gain Congressional support for the aid, President Truman described the aid as promoting democracy in defence of the \\"free world\\", a principle that became known as the Truman Doctrine.Lawrence S Wittner, \\"How Presidents Use the Term ‚ÄòDemocracy‚Äô as a Marketing Tool\\", Retrieved October 29, 2010 The US sought to promote an economically strong and politically united Western Europe to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union. This was done openly using tools such as the European Recovery Program, which encouraged European economic integration. The International Authority for the Ruhr, designed to keep German industry down and controlled, evolved into the European Coal and Steel Community, a founding pillar of the European Union. The United States also worked covertly to promote European integration, for example using the American Committee on United Europe to funnel funds to European federalist movements. In order to ensure that Western Europe could withstand the Soviet military threat, the Western European Union was founded in 1948 and NATO in 1949. The first NATO Secretary General, Lord Ismay, famously stated the organisation's goal was \\"to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down\\". However, without the manpower and industrial output of West Germany no conventional defence of Western Europe had any hope of succeeding. To remedy this, in 1950 the US sought to promote the European Defence Community, which would have included a rearmed West Germany. The attempt was dashed when the French Parliament rejected it. On 9 May 1955, West Germany was instead admitted to NATO; the immediate result was the creation of the Warsaw Pact five days later. The Cold War also saw the creation of propaganda and espionage organisations such as Radio Free Europe, the Information Research Department, the Gehlen Organization, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Special Activities Division, and the Ministry for State Security. Asia World map of colonization at the end of the Second World War in 1945 In Asia, the surrender of Japanese forces was complicated by the split between East and West as well as by the movement toward national self-determination in European colonial territories. China Generalissimo alt=A Chinese man in military uniform, smiling and looking towards the left. He holds a sword in his left hand and has a medal in shape of a sun on his chest. As agreed at the Yalta Conference, the Soviet Union went to war against Japan three months after the defeat of Germany. The Soviet forces invaded Manchuria. This was the end of the Manchukuo puppet state and all Japanese settlers were forced to leave China. The Soviet Union dismantled the industrial base in Manchuria built up by the Japanese in the preceding years. Manchuria also became a base for the Communist Chinese forces because of the Soviet presence. After the war, the Kuomintang (KMT) party (led by generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek) and the Communist Chinese forces resumed their civil war, which had been temporarily suspended when they fought together against Japan. The fight against the Japanese occupiers had strengthened popular support among the Chinese for the Communist guerrilla forces while it weakened the KMT, who depleted their strength fighting a conventional war. Full-scale war between the opposing forces broke out in June 1946. Despite U.S. support to the Kuomintang, Communist forces were ultimately victorious and established the People's Republic of China (PRC) on the mainland. The KMT forces retreated to the island of Taiwan in 1949. Hostilities had largely ceased in 1950. With the Communist victory in the civil war, the Soviet Union gave up its claim to military bases in China that it had been promised by the Western Allies during World War II. The defeat of the US-backed KMT led to a debate in the United States about who in the US government was responsible for this. The outbreak of the Korean War diverted the attention of the PRC at the same time as it bolstered US support for Chiang Kai-shek, the two main factors that prevented the PRC from invading Taiwan. Intermittent military clashes occurred between the PRC and Taiwan from 1950-1979. Taiwan unilaterally declared the civil war over in 1991, but no formal peace treaty or truce exists and the PRC officially sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that rightfully belongs to it and has expressed its opposition to Taiwanese independence. Even so, tensions between the two states has decreased over time for example with the Chen- Chiang summits (2008-2011). Sino-American relations (between the PRC and the US) continued to be mostly hostile up until US president Nixon visited China in 1972. From this point, the relations between them have improved over time although some tension and rivalry remain even with the end of the Cold War and the PRC's distancing from the Communist ideology. Korea Yalta Soviet- American 38th parallel division to the stalemate of 1953 that was officially ended in 2018 by North Korean Kim Jong-Un and South Korean Moon Jae-In At the Yalta Conference, the Allies agreed that an undivided post-war Korea would be placed under four-power multinational trusteeship. After Japan's surrender, this agreement was modified to a joint Soviet-American occupation of Korea.Dennis Wainstock, Truman, McArthur and the Korean War, Greenwood, 1999, p.3 The agreement was that Korea would be divided and occupied by the Soviets from the north and the Americans from the south.Dennis Wainstock, Truman, McArthur and the Korean War, Greenwood, 1999, pp.3, 5 Korea, formerly under Japanese rule, and which had been partially occupied by the Red Army following the Soviet Union's entry into the war against Japan, was divided at the 38th parallel on the orders of the US War Department.Jon Halliday and Bruce Cumings, Korea: The unknown war, London: Viking, 1988, pp. 10, 16, A US military government in southern Korea was established in the capital city of Seoul.Edward Grant Meade, American military government in Korea,: King's Crown Press 1951, p.78A. Wigfall Green, The Epic of Korea, Washington: Public Affairs Press, 1950, p. 54 The American military commander, Lt. Gen. John R. Hodge, enlisted many former Japanese administrative officials to serve in this government.Walter G Hermes, Truce Tent and Fighting Front, Washington, D.C.: US Army Center of Military History, 1992, p. 6 North of the military line, the Soviets administered the disarming and demobilisation of repatriated Korean nationalist guerrillas who had fought on the side of Chinese nationalists against the Japanese in Manchuria during World War II. Simultaneously, the Soviets enabled a build-up of heavy armaments to pro-communist forces in the north.James M Minnich, The North Korean People's Army: origins and current tactics, Naval Institute Press, 2005 pp.4-10 The military line became a political line in 1948, when separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel, each republic claiming to be the legitimate government of Korea. It culminated in the north invading the south, start of the Korean War two years later. Malaya Labour and civil unrest broke out in the British colony of Malaya in 1946. A state of emergency was declared by the colonial authorities in 1948 with the outbreak of acts of terrorism. The situation deteriorated into a full-scale anti-colonial insurgency, or Anti- British National Liberation War as the insurgents referred to it, led by the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), the military wing of the Malayan Communist Party.Mohamed Amin and Malcolm Caldwell (eds.), The Making of a Neo Colony, London: Spokesman Books, 1977, footnote, p. 216 The Malayan Emergency would endure for the next 12 years, ending in 1960. In 1967, communist leader Chin Peng reopened hostilities, culminating in a second emergency that lasted until 1989. French Indochina Events during World War II in the colony of French Indochina (consisting of the modern-day states of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) set the stage for the First Indochina War which in turn led to the Vietnam War. During World War II, the Vichy French aligned colonial authorities cooperated with the Japanese invaders. The communist-controlled common front Viet Minh (supported by the Allies) was formed among the Vietnamese in the colony in 1941 to fight for the independence of Vietnam, against both the Japanese and prewar French powers. After the Vietnamese Famine of 1945 support for the Viet Minh was bolstered as the front launched a rebellion, sacking rice warehouses and urging the Vietnamese to refuse to pay taxes. Because the French colonial authorities started to hold secret talks with the Free French, the Japanese interned them 9 March 1945. When Japan surrendered in August, this created a power vacuum, and the Viet Minh took power in the August Revolution, declaring the independent Democratic Republic of Vietnam. However, the Allies (including the Soviet Union) all agreed that the area belonged to the French. Nationalist Chinese forces moved in from the north and British from the south (as the French were unable to do so immediately themselves) and then handed power to the French, a process completed by March 1946. Attempts to integrate the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with French rule failed and the Viet Minh launched their rebellion against the French rule starting the First Indochina War that same year (the Viet Minh organized common fronts to fight the French in Laos and Cambodia). The war ended in 1954 with French withdrawal and a partition of Vietnam that was intended to be temporary until elections could be held. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam held the north while South Vietnam formed into a separate republic in control of Ngo Dinh Diem who was backed in his refusal to hold elections by the US. The communist party of the south eventually organized the common front NLF to fight to unite south and north under the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and thus began the Vietnam War, which ended with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam conquering the South in 1975. Dutch East Indies A soldier of an Indian armoured regiment examines a light tank used by Indonesian nationalists and captured by British forces during the fighting in Surabaya. Japan invaded and occupied Indonesia during the war and replaced much of the Dutch colonial state. Although the top positions were held by Japanese, the internment of all Dutch citizens meant that Indonesians filled many leadership and administrative positions. Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945, nationalist leaders Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta declared Indonesian independence. A four and a half-year struggle followed as the Dutch tried to re-establish their colony, using a significant portion of their Marshall Plan aid to this end. The Dutch were directly helped by UK forces who sought to re-establish the colonial dominions in Asia. The UK also kept 35,000 Japanese Surrendered Personnel under arms to fight the Indonesians. Although Dutch forces re-occupied most of Indonesia's territory, a guerrilla struggle ensued, and the majority of Indonesians, and ultimately international opinion, favoured Indonesian independence. In December 1949, the Netherlands formally recognised Indonesian sovereignty. Covert operations and espionage Big Three\\" at the Yalta Conference: Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin. Diplomatic relations between their three countries changed radically in the aftermath of World War II. British covert operations in the Baltic States, which began in 1944 against the Nazis, escalated after the war. In Operation Jungle, the Secret Intelligence Service (known as MI6) recruited and trained Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians for the clandestine work in the Baltic states between 1948 and 1955. Leaders of the operation included Alfons Rebane, Stasys ≈Ωymantas, and R≈´dolfs SilarƒÅjs. The agents were transported under the cover of the \\"British Baltic Fishery Protection Service\\". They launched from British-occupied Germany, using a converted World War II E-boat captained and crewed by former members of the wartime German navy.Sigured Hess, \\"The British Baltic Fishery Protection Service (BBFPS) and the Clandestine Operations of Hans Helmut Klose 1949-1956.\\" Journal of Intelligence History vol. 1, no. 2 (Winter 2001) British intelligence also trained and infiltrated anti-communist agents into Russia from across the Finnish border, with orders to assassinate Soviet officials.Tom Bower, The Red Web: MI6 and the KGB, London: Aurum, 1989, pp. 19, 22-3 In the end, counter- intelligence supplied to the KGB by Kim Philby allowed the KGB to penetrate and ultimately gain control of MI6's entire intelligence network in the Baltic states.Bower, (1989) pp. 38, 49, 79 Vietnam and the Middle East would later damage the reputation gained by the US during its successes in Europe. The KGB believed that the Third World rather than Europe was the arena in which it could win the Cold War.Christopher Andrew & Vasili Mitrokhin, The World was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World, New York: Basic Books, 2005, foreword, p. xxvi Moscow would in later years fuel an arms buildup in Africa. In later years, African countries used as proxies in the Cold War would often become \\"failed states\\" of their own.Judt, \\"A Story Still to Be Told\\" Recruitment of former enemy scientists V-2 rocket launching at Peenem√ºnde, on the Baltic German coast (1943). When the divisions of postwar Europe began to emerge, the war crimes programmes and denazification policies of Britain and the United States were relaxed in favour of recruiting German scientists, especially nuclear and long-range rocket scientists.Tom Bower, The Paperclip Conspiracy: Battle for the spoils and secrets of Nazi Germany, London: Michael Joseph, 1987, pp.75-8, Many of these, prior to their capture, had worked on developing the German V-2 long-range rocket at the Baltic coast German Army Research Center Peenem√ºnde. Western Allied occupation force officers in Germany were ordered to refuse to cooperate with the Soviets in sharing captured wartime secret weapons,Bower, op cit, pp.95-6 the recovery for which, specifically in regards to advanced German aviation technology and personnel, the British had sent the Fedden Mission into Germany to contact its aviation technology centers and key personnel, paralleled by the United States with its own Operation Lusty aviation technology personnel and knowledge recovery program. In Operation Paperclip, beginning in 1945, the United States imported 1,600 German scientists and technicians, as part of the intellectual reparations owed to the US and the UK, including about $10 billion (US$ billion in dollars) in patents and industrial processes.Naimark, Science Technology and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Postwar Germany p.60 In late 1945, three German rocket-scientist groups arrived in the U.S. for duty at Fort Bliss, Texas, and at White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico, as \\"War Department Special Employees\\". The wartime activities of some Operation Paperclip scientists would later be investigated. Arthur Rudolph left the United States in 1984, in order to not be prosecuted. Similarly, Georg Rickhey, who came to the United States under Operation Paperclip in 1946, was returned to Germany to stand trial at the Mittelbau-Dora war crimes trial in 1947. Following his acquittal, he returned to the United States in 1948 and eventually became a US citizen. The Soviets began Operation Osoaviakhim in 1946. NKVD and Soviet army units effectively deported thousands of military- related technical specialists from the Soviet occupation zone of post-war Germany to the Soviet Union. The Soviets used 92 trains to transport the specialists and their families, an estimated 10,000-15,000 people. Much related equipment was also moved, the aim being to virtually transplant research and production centres, such as the relocated V-2 rocket centre at Mittelwerk Nordhausen, from Germany to the Soviet Union. Among the people moved were Helmut Gr√∂ttrup and about two hundred scientists and technicians from Mittelwerk. Personnel were also taken from AEG, BMW's Stassfurt jet propulsion group, IG Farben's Leuna chemical works, Junkers, Schott AG, Siebel, Telefunken, and Carl Zeiss AG. The operation was commanded by NKVD deputy Colonel General Serov, outside the control of the local Soviet Military Administration. The major reason for the operation was the Soviet fear of being condemned for noncompliance with Allied Control Council agreements on the liquidation of German military installations. Some Western observers thought Operation Osoaviakhim was a retaliation for the failure of the Socialist Unity Party in elections, though Osoaviakhim was clearly planned before that. Demise of the League of Nations and the founding of the United Nations World map showing member states of the League of Nations (in green and red) on 18 April 1946, when the League of Nations ceased to exist. As a general consequence of the war and in an effort to maintain international peace,Yoder, Amos. The Evolution of the United Nations System, p. 39. the Allies formed the United Nations (UN), which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945.History of the UN The UN replaced the defunct League of Nations (LN) as an intergovernmental organization. The LN was formally dissolved on 20 April 1946 but had in practice ceased to function in 1939, being unable to stop the outbreak of World War II. The UN inherited some of the bodies of the LN, such as the International Labour Organization. League of Nations mandates, mostly territories that had changed hands in World War I, became United Nations Trust Territories. South-West Africa, an exception, was still governed under terms of the original mandate. As the successor body to the League, the UN still assumed a supervisory role over the territory. The Free City of Danzig, a semi-autonomous city state that was partly overseen by the League, became part of Poland. The UN adopted The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, \\"as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations.\\" The Soviet Union abstained from voting on adoption of the declaration. The US did not ratify the social and economic rights sections. The five major Allied powers were given permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council. The permanent members can veto any United Nations Security Council resolution, the only UN decisions that are binding according to international law. The five powers at the time of founding were: the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union and the Republic of China. The Republic of China lost the Chinese Civil War and retreated to the island of Taiwan by 1950 but continued to be a permanent member of the Council even though the de facto state in control of mainland China was the People's Republic of China (PRC). This was changed in 1971 when the PRC was given the permanent membership previously held by the Republic of China. Russia inherited the permanent membership of the Soviet Union in 1991 after the dissolution of that state. Unresolved conflicts Japanese holdouts persisted on various islands in the Pacific Theatre until at least 1974. Although all hostilities are now resolved, a peace treaty has never been signed between Japan and Russia due to the Kuril Islands dispute. Economic aftermath By the end of the war, the European economy had collapsed with some 70% of its industrial infrastructure destroyed.\\"Who benefits from global violence and war: uncovering a destructive system\\". Marc Pilisuk, Jennifer Achord Rountree (2008). Greenwood Publishing Group. p.136. The property damage in the Soviet Union consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, and 31,850 industrial establishments.The New York Times, 9 February 1946, Volume 95, Number 32158. The strength of the economic recovery following the war varied throughout the world, though in general, it was quite robust, particularly in the United States. In Europe, West Germany, after having continued to decline economically during the first years of the Allied occupation, later experienced a remarkable recovery, and had by the end of the 1950s doubled production from its pre-war levels. Italy came out of the war in poor economic condition, but by the 1950s, the Italian economy was marked by stability and high growth. France rebounded quickly and enjoyed rapid economic growth and modernisation under the Monnet Plan. The UK, by contrast, was in a state of economic ruin after the war and continued to experience relative economic decline for decades to follow. The Soviet Union also experienced a rapid increase in production in the immediate post-war era. Japan experienced rapid economic growth, becoming one of the most powerful economies in the world by the 1980s. China, following the conclusion of its civil war, was essentially bankrupt. By 1953, economic restoration seemed fairly successful as production had resumed pre-war levels. This growth rate mostly persisted, though it was interrupted by economic experiments during the disastrous Great Leap Forward. At the end of the war, the United States produced roughly half of the world's industrial output. The US, of course, had been spared industrial and civilian devastation. Further, much of its pre-war industry had been converted to wartime usage. As a result, with its industrial and civilian base in much better shape than most of the world, the US embarked on an economic expansion unseen in human history. US Gross Domestic Product increased from $228 billion in 1945 to just under $1.7 trillion in 1975.

Located three miles (5 km) north east of Chichester, it is twinned with Hermanville-sur-Mer in Lower Normandy, France. The parish has a land area of 467.3 hectares (1,154 acres). In the 2001 census 2,462 people lived in 963 households, of whom 1,233 were economically active. At the 2011 Census the population was 2,625. Origin of the name The origin of the name Tangmere is not certain. 'Mere' implies a pool rather than a grand lake, and 'tang' is thought to mean tongs or a serpent's tongue. It could be that Tangmere was the pool at the fork, or junction, of two ancient paths. The pool was later filled in to form a small village green. History The Saxon village lies a mile south of the Roman road of Stane Street, linking Londinium with Noviomagus Reginorum, now known as Chichester. In 677 the controversial Bishop of York Wilfrid (later Saint Wilfrid) came to Selsey and converted the South Saxons to Christianity. In 680 a charter, possibly by the king, states: ‚ÄúI Caedwalla... have granted his brethren serving God at the church of St Andrew... the land of 10 hides which is called Tangmere‚Äù. A hide equated to 120 acres (49 hectares). The Domesday Survey records that Tangmere had a population of around 120, with the stone church of St Andrew built after the Norman conquest. Originally built of timber, the Saxon church was replaced in 1100 by a stone and timber building. Difficult to date precisely, the building incorporates scavenged and reused stone, including pre-Christian carved figures and Roman bricks, while the size of the yew tree by the present door suggests an ancient sacred site. The church was added to in both the 12th century and in the Victorian era. In 1341 King Edward II granted the new Archbishop of Canterbury the right to hold a fair at Tangmere on St Andrew's Day. The event is still held by the church every autumn, resulting in the source of the church's name. The Manor of Tangmere was owned by the Archbishop of Canterbury until 1542, when Henry VIII claimed possession. It later passed to Cardinal Archbishop Pole and then to the crown again, being granted by Elizabeth I to Richard Baker and then Sir Richard Sackville, a cousin of her mother Anne Boleyn. In 1579 the manor became part of the Halnaker estate, which was later acquired by the 3rd Duke of Richmond. When he died in 1806, the Goodwood estate, including Tangmere, totalled 17,000 acres (69 km¬≤). Goodwood maintained ownership of Tangmere land until the 1930s. Royal Air Force station 150px Tangmere was formerly the home of the RAF Tangmere airfield, which played a pivotal role in the Second World War, especially during the Battle of Britain. Part of the former airfield is now home to the Tangmere Military Aviation Museum. Founded in 1917 for use by the Royal Flying Corps as a training aerodrome, in 1918 it was turned over to the American Air Force. Mothballed after the First World War, in 1925 the RAF station re-opened to serve the Fleet Air Arm, then under the control of the RAF, and went operational in 1926 with No. 43 Squadron. In 1939 the airfield was enlarged to defend the south coast against attack by the Luftwaffe, with Tangmere's only hotel and some houses being demolished in the process. The RAF commandeered the majority of houses in the centre of the village, with only six to eight families being allowed to stay. In August 1940 the first squadron (602) of Supermarine Spitfires was based at the satellite airfield at nearby Westhampnett. The first and worst enemy raid on the station came on 16 August 1940, when 100 Junkers Stuka dive bombers caused extensive damage to buildings and aircraft on the ground. Fourteen service people and six civilians were killed. Throughout the war the station was also a secret base for the Special Operations Executive (SOE), who flew agents in and out of occupied France to strengthen the Resistance. The SOE used Tangmere Cottage, opposite the main entrance to the airfield. Today the cottage sports a commemorative blue plaque to its former secret life. As the RAF turned from defence to attack, the legendary Group Captain Douglas Bader ‚Äì the legless fighter ace ‚Äì commanded the Tangmere wing of Fighter Command. Today he is commemorated in the Bader Arms public house in the village, now converted to a Co-op grocery store. Many of those killed at the base, from both sides during the war, are buried in the cemetery of St Andrew's Church, tended to by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission After the war the RAF High Speed Flight was based at Tangmere and in September 1946 a world air speed record of was set by Group Captain Edward Mortlock Donaldson in a Gloster Meteor. During September 1953 Squadron Leader Neville Duke flew a Hawker Hunter at ; the 50th anniversary of this event was commemorated in 2003. The station finally closed on 16 October 1970, when a single Spitfire flew over the airfield as the RAF ensign was lowered for the last time. Recent history Following the closure of the RAF station some of the land around the runways was returned to farming. Tangmere Airfield Nurseries have built huge glasshouses for the cultivation of peppers and aubergines. Until 1983, of barracks, admin blocks and repair workshops remained derelict until bought by Seawards Properties Ltd. Housing soon spread around the airfield, and much RAF building was demolished and officers' houses retained as homes. However, some original RAF buildings remain, including the control tower and one of the 'H-Block' accommodation buildings. The Tangmere Military Aviation Museum, now a major visitor attraction and base for annual celebrations, was founded by a group of enthusiastic veterans. The Parish Council was established in 1966; since when the village has slowly resumed its development as a rural community rather than a military one. With the boom in modern housing there has been an influx of young families, most of whom work in and around Chichester.

The S-1 contains the basic business and financial information on an issuer with respect to a specific securities offering. Investors may use the prospectus to consider the merits of an offering and make educated investment decisions. A prospectus is one of the main documents used by an investor to research a company prior to an initial public offering (IPO). Other less detailed registration forms, such as Form S-3 may be used for certain registrations. Every business day from 10 to 5, S-1 forms are filed with the SEC's EDGAR filing system, the required filing format of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. However many of these (typically 30% to 90%) are of the related Form S-1/A, which is used for filing amendments to a previously filed Form S-1. The S-1 form has an OMB approval number of 3234-0065 and the online form is only 8 pages long. However the simplicity of the form's design is belied by the OMB Office's figure of the estimated average burden ‚Äì 972.32 hours. This means that much time and effort in preparation of the form is being used to collect and display information about the filer (a corporate registrant or new registrant who intends to offer securities). The S-1 form requires that the registrant provide information from diverse sources and incorporate this information using many rules or regulations, such as General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act, Regulation C, Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X. Under the JOBS Act, it has been possible since April 2012 for \\"emerging growth companies\\" to file a Form S-1 on a confidential basis, only making the contents public 21 days prior to the road show for the IPO. This quickly became a popular method for even established companies (such as Manchester United and MGM Studios) to conduct securities offerings.

His watercolors can be found in museums, travelling exhibitions as well as in private collections. Much of his bright and animated work was inspired by his time living in the Florida Keys. √âtienne was born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1941, but spent most of his childhood in Quebec province, Canada. At the age of 27, in 1978, he graduated from the Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles, California. He was also elected Senior Academician of the Royal Canadian Academy. He has exhibited his work in many cities from around the world including Paris, London, Sydney and New York. His work in animation includes design, editing and production of an IMAX production featuring of some of his paintings. He won an Emmy in Australia for animation. Errol was profiled in the January/February 1980 issue of Communication Arts magazine. The article covered his graphic design work while in Vancouver, B.C. Canada, where he did business under the name of the \\"Frog and Bison\\" \\"Frog\\" being a reference to his years in Montreal, Quebec, and \\"Bison\\" for a former associate in Montana. At that time Errol also operated a studio/gallery, the \\"Frog and Swan\\" with artist/calligrapher Robin Arkell. Errol is noted for his no-compromise professionalism, as expressed in this quotation from the Communication Arts magazine: \\"I don't let people make changes in my work because it's so personal. I know production and what the job needs, and the only thing that's important is the end product. How you get to that is the problem because the only standard is that it must be excellent. There is really is no excuse for a mediocre final product.\\" While he worked in numerous mediums, his work as a water colorist was considered world-class. During the last 20 years of his life, his technique never varied. Subject matter was drawn primarily from his visual interpretation of nature (fish, flowers and panoramas) using bold colors. Watercolors were created exclusively on two papers: Arches moldmade in France and Khadi handmade in India. He believed those two papers best displayed the positive optimism of his subject matter. He would initially draw his subject with one of two instruments: a Mout Blanc pen given to him by his father as a teenager or a common wide pencil employed in the construction industry. Once subject matter was drawn he would hand mix the colors he thought appropriate for an individual work. The technique that made his work most distinctive was the exclusive use of hand made Windsor Newton squirrel hair brushes which he would curl at the end to create different size strokes with the same brush. He also believed that a single stroke of color was the truest reflection of the artist. None of his watercolors have the overlapping use of color. He coined the phrase \\"singlelapping\\" to describe his unique technique. While impossible to estimate precisely, by the artists own estimate he created over 8,000 works of original art.

The gun saw combat in the German-Soviet War.  Development and production history  The gun resulted from a modernization of the Russian 122 mm howitzer M1909, initially developed by Krupp. The M1909 was employed by the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and remained in service after the revolution. From late 1920s the RKKA sought to upgrade its First World War-era artillery pieces. The modernization of the M1909, handled by Perm Plant in 1937, included: * Lengthened chamber * New sights * Strengthened carriage The resulting gun was adopted as 122-mm howitzer M1909/37. About 800-900 old M1909 guns were upgraded to the M1909/37 standard. The M1909/37 was a typical short-barrel howitzer, intended mostly for shooting with elevations from +20¬∞ to +43¬∞. Shell could be fired with six propellant loads (no. 1 to 5 and full). The gun had horizontal sliding breechblock, hydraulic recoil buffer and spring-driven recuperator. The carriage was of single trail type with unsprung wooden wheels and limited traverse.  Organization and employment  M1909/37 in H√§meenlinna Artillery Museum, Finland. M1909/37 in H√§meenlinna Artillery Museum, Finland.  Red Army  The M1909/37 was a divisional level howitzer. According to the organization of 1939, each rifle division had two artillery regiments - light regiment (a battalion of 76 mm guns; two mixed battalions with one battery of 76 mm guns and two batteries of 122 mm howitzers) and howitzer regiment (a battalion of 122 mm howitzers and a battalion of 152 mm howitzers), giving 28 122 mm howitzers per division. In June 1940 one more battalion of 122 mm howitzers was added to the howitzers regiment, bringing the number to 32. In June 1941 the howitzers regiment was removed and the number of howitzers dropped to 16. This organization was used throughout the war, except in guard rifle divisions which from December 1942 had three artillery battalions (two batteries of 76 mm guns and one battery of 122 mm howitzers each), totaling 12 howitzers. From December 1944 they received howitzer regiment (5 batteries, 20 howitzers). From June 1945 rifle divisions were reorganized identically. Mountain rifle divisions in 1939-40 had one battalion of 122 mm howitzers (3 batteries, 9 guns). From 1941 they received instead one artillery regiment (2 battalions, each from 3 four-gun batteries) with 24 howitzers. From early 1942 only one battalion (2 batteries, 8 howitzers) remained. From 1944 howitzers were removed from mountain rifle divisions. Motorized divisions had two mixed battalions (battery of 76 mm guns, two batteries of 122 mm howitzers), totaling 12 howitzers. Tank division had one battalion with 12 howitzers. Cavalry divisions until August 1941 had two batteries of 122 mm howitzers, totaling 8, then the divisional artillery was removed. Until late 1941 rifle brigades had a battery of four 122 mm howitzers. 122 mm howitzers were also used by the howitzer brigades of the Reserve of the Main Command (72-84 pieces). The M1909/37 started to replace the M1909 in 1937. By 1 October 1936 RKKA possessed 920 M1909 howitzers; until the beginning of the German-Soviet War all of them were replaced. The modernized gun saw combat in the Winter War and the German-Soviet War. On 1 June 1941 RKKA possessed about 800 pieces.778 according to Isaev, 881 according to http://www.soldat.ru/doc/mobilization/mob/table17.html, 800 according to Ivanov Due to combat losses, by the middle of the war only a limited number of pieces remained in service.  Other operators  A number of M1909/37s fell into the hands of Wehrmacht in 1941-42 and were adopted as 12,2 cm le.F.H.386(r). Finnish Army captured a few in the Winter War and further 21 in the Continuation War. In Finnish service the gun was designated 122 H/09-30. The howitzers were used against their former owners; a few were lost in combat. Finns also modernized in a similar way M1909 howitzers they possessed since the Civil War, resulting in a gun designated 122 H/09-40 (about 30 pieces); the guns were used in the Continuation War. Summary The M1909/37 was a relatively minor upgrade of a World War I-era howitzer, which didn't address the main flaws of the latter, namely: * Limited towing speed due to unsprung wheels * Limited elevation and very small traverse The short barrel meant short range, smaller than that of its main adversaries, such as the German 10.5 cm leFH 16 (8,9 km vs 10,7 km). Low muzzle velocity and small traverse also made the gun helpless against enemy armor. Although in 1943 a HEAT shell was developed, the aforementioned deficiences meant that a chance of hitting small moving target was slim. On the other side, the M1909/37 was rugged and reliable. It was also lighter than the newer M-30 or the 10.5 cm le.F.H.16. It was similar in most characteristics to another modernized World War I-era howitzer in Soviet service, the M1910/30, except slower rate of fire. In 1937 the Soviet Union still did not possess a modern 122-mm howitzer design ready for mass production, so upgrading old ones was a reasonable decision.  Ammunition  Although the M1909/37 has slightly longer barrel and slightly smaller maximum elevation than the M1910/30, according to ShirokoradShirokorad - Encyclopedia of the Soviet Artillery these guns had identical ballistics. {border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\\"margin:0 0 .5em 1em;

It was founded by ƒêuraƒë Crnojeviƒá, the Serbian medieval ruler of Zeta between 1490 and 1496. The printing press was operated by Serbian Orthodox monks at the supervision of Hieromonk Makarije. The Crnojeviƒá printing press was also the first state press in the world. Five Orthodox liturgical books were printed in this printshop: Oktoih Prvoglasnik, Oktoih Petoglasnik, Psaltir, Trebnik (Molitvenik) and Cvetni Triod. *Octoechos of the First Tone (Oktoih provglasnik) is the first book printed in the Cyrillic script among the South Slavs. It was finished on 4 January 1494. There are 108 copies of this book existing. It contains 270 leaves sized 29 x 21,6 cm. It is characterized by high quality and clean two-coloured printing, red and black, with nicely shaped letters. It is decorated with headpieces and initials printed from woodcuts in the spirit of the Renaissance with traces of old manuscript traditions. *Octoechos of the Fifth Tone (Oktoih petoglasnik) represents the first illustrated South Slavic incunabulum. It is preserved in fragments, the longest one containing 37 leaves. It has six woodcut illustrations, made by an artist who managed to put rather complex compositions with many characters on a relatively small space. *Psalter with Additions (Psaltir s posledovanjem) was printed in 1495. It is not only of liturgical and conventional but also historical and literary significance. It is decorated with three headpieces and 27 initials repeated for 221 time. There are 36 complete and partial copies preserved. The National Library of Montenegro \\"Djurdje Crnojevic\\" published 650 facsimiles of the psalter in 1986.  Legacy  In his 1514 letter to Ragusan senate, Ragusan nobleman Luka Primojeviƒá emphasized that he had intention to print books using the same letters used by Serbian priests in their churches, the same letters used in the Crnojeviƒá printing house which books were well respected and praised. Although his intention to establish a printing house in Dubrovnik and to print Cyrillic books failed, his written statements left significant testimony about high reputation of books printed in the Crnojeviƒá printing house.

In the United States ultra low #2 diesel is the common fuel used. It is dyed red to show that it is road-tax exempt. In most markets of the United States heating oil is the same specification of fuel as on-road un-dyed diesel. An oil burner is a part attached to an oil furnace, water heater, or boiler. It provides the ignition of heating oil/biodiesel fuel used to heat either air or water via a heat exchanger. The fuel is atomized into a fine spray usually by forcing it under pressure through a nozzle which gives the resulting flame a specific flow rate, angle of spray and pattern (variations of a cone shape). This spray is usually ignited by an electric spark with the air being forced through around it at the end of a blast tube, by a fan driven by the oil burner motor. The fuel pump is typically driven via a coupling connecting its shaft to that of the motor's. Oil burners also include combustion-proving devices to prevent out-of-control combustion - Primary Control; Safety Control; Cad Cell Control; Master Control; Fire-Eye Control are all common names for the 'combustion safety control'. In the United States residential home heating oil market the \\"vaporizing gun burner\\" is the most common mechanical device used to heat a home or small commercial forced air space with. Depending on the manufacturer these simple burners will see a lifespan if regularly maintained for decades. Currently, old installations from the 1950s and 1960s are still in operation today if they received regular maintenance. The maintenance involved in a gun burner usually is a replacement of the nozzle used to atomize the fuel, replacing the filter located at the air handler, replacing the fuel filter on the heating oil system from the tank, cleaning out any soot or deposits in the heat exchanger of the furnace, and ensuring the system is in good working order, and also involves checking and adjusting the fuel-air mixture for efficiency with a combustion analyzer. If a heating oil burner runs out of oil it often must be primed to be restarted. Priming involves purging any air from the fuel lines so that a steady flow of oil can find its way to the burner. If an oil burner wears out it can usually be upgraded and replaced with a more efficient modern burner. If the heat exchanger wears out that requires a new furnace. Oil furnaces will last nearly forever if maintained regularly ensuring the heat exchanger is vacuumed out and cleaned. Oil burners deposit soot in the heat exchanger which is an un-even insulator. The heat distribution in the heat exchanger is un-even, causing wear on this critical steel part causing an eventual cracking. Annual or every other year tune-ups guarantee this wear is far reduced. Oil furnace lifespans of fifty to seventy-five years with regular service are not uncommon compared to an average wear out of natural gas furnaces every twenty years. Fuel injection Used nozzles from an oil burner Fuel is injected into the combustion chamber by a spray nozzle. The nozzles are usually supplied with high pressure oil. Because erosion from friction with the oil, and possible blockage due to lumps in it, they need replacement when worn. Fuel nozzles are usually rated in fuel volume flow per unit time e.g. USGal/h (U.S. Gallons per hour). A fuel nozzle is characterized by three features: * Flow at 100psi pump pressure (e.g. 0.65 USGal/h) * Spray characteristic (e.g. \\"S\\") * Spray angle (e.g. 60 ¬∞) Alternatively fuel may be passed over a tiny orifice fed with compressed air. This arrangement is referred to as Babington atomiser/nozzle, named after its inventor Robert Babington. As the oil flows over the nozzle, the fuel needn't be under any great pressure. If the pump can handle such the oil may even contain lumps such as scraps of food. Because it is only compressed air that passes through the orifice hole, such nozzles do not suffer much from erosion.  Oil pump  Oil pump A gear pump of two parts: Gear pump assembly This pumps the oil in and increases the pressure in the nozzles to 15 bar maximum (217.5 psi). Usually a gerotor of the sickle type is used. Gear pumps are used frequently in oil burners because of their simplicity, stability and low price. Pressure regulator To set the heat output of the burner, the rate of fuel delivery via the nozzle must be adjustable. This is often achieved by an adjustable pressure relief valve between the pump and the nozzle. When the set pressure is reached (usually 100psi), this valve opens and allows excess oil to flow through a bypass back to the fuel tank or the pump suction side.  Electromagnetic valve  A small two-stage industrial burner. The blue cubes are the coils of the two electromagnetic valves. This allows fuel to be shut off from the sprayer by electrical control. It helps avoid drips when the valve is closed. It also eases the purging of the burner (and any boiler) of fuel mist during startup, or while restarting after a misfire. If the burner were not purged the oil/air mixture could explode dangerously.  Fan  The fan blows air into the combustion chamber. The rotor of the fan is powered by an electric motor. Igniters Some oil burners use glow bars which operate much like the glow plugs of a diesel engine. Many use high voltage generated by a voltage-step up transformer to create a spark for ignition, somewhat similar to a spark plug. Original oil burner transformers were copper wire conductors wrapped around an iron core. A standard type of transformer to this day. In the mid-90s electronic igniters replaced the copper and iron transformer, solving many problems related to the old style transformer. This new technology in igniters would soon replace all old style transformers throughout the oil burner industry. The new igniters would run cooler so the output voltage could be increased from 10,000 to 20,000 VAC. This increase of voltage would be more reliable, reduce delayed ignition, run cooler and all while using less energy. The voltage is high, but a standard igniter will only pull around 35 milliamps.  Safety control LDR Oil-fired burners are fitted with a safety mechanism for determining if the fuel has ignited and a flame present. The terms \\"primary control\\", \\"safety control\\", \\"cad cell control\\", \\"master control\\", and \\"fire-eye control\\" are variously used to describe a light dependent electrical resistor (LDR) which detects the flame whose value changes by the amount of light it is exposed to. The resistance decreases as the LDR is exposed to more light. The material is usually cadmium sulfide, hence the name \\"cad cell\\" for this component. In darkness the resistance is around 1 MŒ©, while when exposed to light from a properly ignited flame the resistance is significantly lower, around 75‚Äì300 Œ©. Older oil burners were equipped with a primary control installed on the exhaust stack with a bimetallic heat sensing element protruding into the stack, such a control was referred to as a \\"stack relay\\" or a \\"stack control\\". It performed the same function as the newer cad-cell control but instead of sensing light from the burner flame it sensed heat from the flame exhaust gases to prove that ignition took place.  Capacitor start motor  Schematic of a capacitor start motor. The motor which drives the fan and the oil pump is usually a capacitor start motor. It is a single phase, squirrel cage induction motor. The difference with a three-phase motor is in the stator. Where the three phase motor has three coils aligned at 120¬∞ in the stator, the capacitor start motor holds one main winding and one auxiliary winding aligned at 90¬∞. The phase shift of 90¬∞ between the main winding and the auxiliary winding is achieved by a connected capacitor which feeds the auxiliary winding and is connected on the single-phase AC mains. The capacitor will achieve a phase shift of 90¬∞ between the main and the auxiliary winding, producing an acceptable initial torque. This motor is intended for continuous operation.

He most recently played for the Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League (AHL). Hennessy previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Ottawa Senators and Boston Bruins. Early career As a youth, Hennessy played in the 1999 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Boston Junior Eagles minor ice hockey team. Hennessy was drafted 17th overall in 2001, by the Quebec Remparts in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League draft. He finished the 2001‚Äì02 QMJHL season with 40 points, good for the sixth in scoring on his team. He did not speak French when he arrived, but later became fluent and served as the team's captain. Hennessy played in the 2003 Memorial Cup, but Quebec was eliminated at the after round-robin tournament losing all three games. He was then drafted by the San Jose Sharks 43rd overall at the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. He was awarded the Karcher Plaque as the QMJHL Humanitarian of the Year in 2004. In the 2004‚Äì05 QMJHL season, Hennessey led the team in scoring. Professional career Hennessy began his professional career with the San Jose Sharks' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Cleveland Barons, in 2005‚Äì06. He led the Barons in goals (24) and assists (39) for 63 points in 80 games. He was one of only two players on the team to play in every regular-season game. Hennessy holds the franchise records for both goals and points in a season by a rookie and was named the Barons Rookie of the Year for the 2005‚Äì06 season. Hennessy was traded (along with Tom Preissing) to the Ottawa Senators via the Chicago Blackhawks on July 9, 2006, in a three-way deal; Ottawa traded Bryan Smolinski and Martin Havl√°t to Chicago, who sent Mark Bell to San Jose while sending Michal Barinka and a second-round draft pick in 2008 to Ottawa. Hennessy then spent the majority of 2006‚Äì07 season with the Senators' AHLs affiliate, the Binghamton Senators. During the season on his second call up to Ottawa, Hennessy scored his first NHL goal on January 7, 2007, against the Philadelphia Flyers. On May 6, 2010, Hennessy left the Senators organization after four years, signing a one-year deal with Swiss club HC Lugano. On July 5, 2011, Hennessy signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Boston Bruins. He was assigned to their AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins, for the majority of the 2011‚Äì12 season. In 67 games, he contributed offensively with 41 points before he was recalled to appear in three scoreless games with the Bruins. During the 2014‚Äì15 season, Hennessy featured in 27 games in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) with Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk before opting for a mid-season transfer to Swedish club V√§xj√∂ Lakers on December 30, 2014. In adding 13 points in just 20 games to close out the season with the Lakers and claim the Swedish championship, Hennessy signed a two-year contract extension on June 4, 2015.

He was described by Charles Dickens as \\"an honourable and well-educated showman\\".Zeitler, William. \\"E.G. Robertson \\". Accessed 29 July 2007. Alongside his pioneering work on projection techniques for his shows Robert was also a physics lecturer and a keen balloonist at a time of great development in aviation. Early work Born in Li√®ge Robert studied at Leuven and became a professor of physics specialising in optics. He was an avid painter and intended to move to France to pursue a career in art. He moved to Paris in the 1791 and maintained a living as a painter and draughtsman. While there he attended lectures in natural science at the Coll√®ge de France as well as those by Jacques Charles, a fellow scientist and important figure in ballooning history. Charles would go on to become a mentor for Robert. In 1796, during the French Revolution and three years after the declaration of war between France and Great Britain, Robert met with the French government and proposed a method of burning the invading ships of the British Royal Navy. Based on the myth of the mirrors of Archimedes he wanted to employ enormous mirrors to direct intense amounts of sunlight onto the approaching vessels. The government turned down his suggestion.Burns, Paul. \\"The History of The Discovery of Cinematography: Chapter Six 1750‚Äì1799\\". Accessed 29 July 2007.Adventures in Cybersound. \\"Robertson's Phantasmagoria\\". Accessed 29 July 2007. Robert experimented with various areas of physics, giving public demonstrations about his research into galvanism and optics in the 1790s and early 19th century. Fantasmagorie Inspiration from Philidor's show Robert probably attended one of Paul Philidor's Phantasmagorie shows in Paris in 1792 or 1793. In 1790 in Vienna, Philidor had turned the fake s√©ance ghost projections of charlatans into his pioneering phantasmagoria spectacle that allowed larger audiences to watch a safe but scary show. He probably profited from a strong light source, but especially revolutionized the concept of ghost-raising by claiming he used scientific and optical art to reveal how charlatans duped gullible audiences. After performing in Paris for about half a year, Philidor left and was not heard of again in France (although he took his show to other European cities). With his understanding of optics, Robert would have had relatively little problem figuring out how Philidor's ghosts were created with the magic lantern. Years later, his further technological prowess was combined with his skills in painting and showmanship, in developing his own pre-cinema horror show. He evidently felt safe from any possible claims from Philidor and only slightly altered the spelling of the title that Philidor had introduced in Paris. Fantoscope Robert read the works of 17th-century scholar Athanasius Kircher and was particularly interested in the magic lantern. He created his own version of the device with several improvements, adding adjustable lenses and a moveable carriage system that would allow the operator to change the size of the projected image. He also made it possible to project several different images at once using more than one painted glass slider. The resultant display had a very ghostly effect, especially when in a smoky atmosphere. Through this the operator had the ability to manipulate images projected from an unseen location.Prints George. \\"Phantasmagoria \\". Accessed 29 July 2007. In 1799, after further refining the system, he received a patent for his \\"magic lantern on wheels\\", naming it the Fantoscope. Shows Robert developed a phantasmagoria show based around his projection system and the use of other effects and techniques. Robert scripted scenes that involved actors and ventriloquism alongside his projections, creating a convincing impression of the appearance of ghosts.Heard, Mervyn. \\"The Lantern of Fear \\". Accessed 11 September 2013. Robert used several projection devices in a variety of ways, including rear projection and projection onto large pieces of wax-coated gauze (giving the image a more translucent appearance). He also used smoke and mirrors to further disguise the mechanisms behind his show. His painting skills allowed him to create accurate depictions of famous French heroes such as Jean-Paul Marat, Voltaire, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Robert appeared at the Pavillon de l'Echiquier on 23 January 1798 and performed his first show. His charisma and the never-before-seen visual effects left the audience convinced that they had seen real ghosts, with many left terrified by the performance. After being investigated by the authorities, Robert's show was shut down in Paris. He moved to Bordeaux and continued to perform, before returning to Paris a few weeks later. It was during this trip to Bordeaux that Robert first experience balloon flight as a passenger ‚Äì an experience that would have a massive influence on his life. On his return to Paris Robert discovered that two of his former assistants had continued the performances without him. He refined his show, making it more elaborate and inventive and started performing in a more permanent location from 3 January 1799. The Gothic surroundings of the crumbling Convent des Capucines near the Place Vend√¥me gave Robert the ideal eerie home for his show. The shows began with the audience being shown optical illusions and trompe-l'≈ìil effects on their way to the showroom. Inside the candlelit room the audience would be seated as audio effects emulate the sound of wind and thunder and an unseen glass harmonica plays unsettling music. Robert would then enter the room and start a monologue about death and the afterlife. He then began the show in earnest, creating smoky mix of sulphuric acid and aqua fortis before projecting his ghostly apparitions. The shows were performed at the Convent des Capucines for four years, and Robert went on to take the show around the world, visiting Russia, Spain, and the United States among others. During his travels he dedicated a lot of his time to ballooning. Balloon flights Commemorative 18th century plate Robert was a keen balloonist who designed and flew balloons in different countries around the world. On 18 July 1803 in Hamburg he set an altitude record in a montgolfi√®re. He spent many flights investigating meteorological activity.National Museum of Denmark. \\"The Soul in Nature: 1802 \\".

In fact, he did numerous observations: Observations of barometer and thermometer, on shapes and altitudes of cloud formations, the behaviour of parachutes at different altitudes, the evaporation of Ether, the electrical properties of different materials and the air, behavior of a magnetic needle, the boiling point of Water at great altitudes, sound propagation, influence of the high altitudes on animals (Pigeons and Butterflies), strength of solar radiation, the solar spectrum, gravity properties, chemical composition of the air and pressure of the air. Nevertheless, close examination of the results shows, that many of them contradict with laws of physics, which were already known at the time of the flights. Prof. L.W. Gilbert discussed the results published by Robert in his Annalen der Physik.Gilbert, L.W. \\"Annalen der Physik Volume 16, 1804, p.257-290\\" and showed why Robert was wrong. For example, Robert claimed, that a spring scale with attached weights showed a lower weight at altitude as compared to the ground. Such an effect is existing, but only becomes apparent at altitudes in excess of 70,000 feet (20,000 metres). In 1806 an audience of 50,000, including the royal family, gathered at Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen to see Robert and his balloon. Robert flew all the way to Roskilde ‚Äì a remarkable feat for the time. The event made a lasting impression on Hans Christian √òrsted, an influential Danish physicist who went on to write a series of poems about the flight. Other details Robert officially opened the third Jardin de Tivoli, Paris on 14 May 1826. He died in Paris in 1837 and is buried at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery.

The term biosignal is often used to refer to bioelectrical signals, but it may refer to both electrical and non-electrical signals. The usual understanding is to refer only to time-varying signals, although spatial parameter variations (e.g. the nucleotide sequence determining the genetic code) are sometimes subsumed as well.  Electrical biosignals  Electrical biosignals, or bioelectrical time signals, usually refers to the change in electric current produced by the sum of an electrical potential difference across a specialized tissue, organ or cell system like the nervous system. Thus, among the best-known bioelectrical signals are: * Electroencephalogram (EEG) * Electrocardiogram (ECG) * Electromyogram (EMG) * Mechanomyogram (MMG) * Electrooculography (EOG) * Galvanic skin response (GSR) * Magnetoencephalogram (MEG) EEG, ECG, EOG and EMG are measured with a differential amplifier which registers the difference between two electrodes attached to the skin. However, the galvanic skin response measures electrical resistance and the MEG measures the magnetic field induced by electrical currents (electroencephalogram) of the brain. With the development of methods for remote measurement of electric fields using new sensor technology, electric biosignals such as EEG and ECG can be measured without electric contact with the skin. This can be applied for example for remote monitoring of brain waves and heart beat of patients who must not be touched, in particular patients with serious burns. Electrical currents and changes in electrical resistances across tissues can also be measured from plants. Biosignals may also refer to any non-electrical signal that is capable of being monitored from biological beings, such as mechanical signals (e.g. the mechanomyogram or MMG), acoustic signals (e.g. phonetic and non-phonetic utterances, breathing), chemical signals (e.g. pH, oxygenation) and optical signals (e.g. movements). Use in artistic contexts In recent years, the use of biosignals has gained interest amongst an international artistic community of performers and composers who use biosignals to produce and control sound.

It is the 20th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who appeared in 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot After escaping from the railroad police after stowing away on a train, the Stooges befriend a champion wrestler named Ivan Bustoff (Harrison Greene). His trainers, who are part of the mob, have a large bet placed on Bustoff to win the big match. But Bustoff likes to go out drinking, and after a wild night out with the boys ending in Bustoff downing a mixture made of \\"a little tequila, vodka and cognac\\", which he believes is not alcohol and a different kind of drink, then passes out from drinking the mixture. The mobsters hire/force the Stooges to become Bustoff's managers and get him to the ring sober. In the locker room at the arena, the boys are trying to wake Bustoff up, but end up knocking him out with dumb bells and causing the locker to fall on him. Bustoff remains unconscious. In fear, the Stooges substitute Curly, who possesses a tendency to get violent in reaction to the smell of Wild Hyacinth perfume. Moe and Larry realize that this can be used to their advantage. But the subsequent wrestling match is not a good time for Curly as he performs poorly. Moe then spots a woman spectator holding a bottle of Wild Hyacinth and gets it from her. By this time, the mobsters get wind of Bustoff's non-participation and are threatening the Stooges with harm if Curly does not win as planned. The Wild Hyacinth is then applied to Curly, and soon the challenger is knocked out cold along with nearly everyone else in attendance as Curly goes on a rampage using the match bell as a cudgel. The bell then slips out of Curly's hands and flies up in the air, only to land back onto his head and knock him out as well. Cast Production notes The filming of Grips, Grunts and Groans took place from October 30 to November 5, 1936. Its title parodies the expression \\"gripes, grunts and groans.\\" An external stimulus that causes Curly to go berserk was also used as a plot element in Punch Drunks, Horses' Collars, and Tassels in the Air.

An oil burner engine is a steam engine that uses oil as its fuel. The term is usually applied to a locomotive or ship engine that burns oil to heat water, to produce the steam which drives the pistons, or turbines, from which the power is derived. This is mechanically very different from diesel engines, which use internal combustion, although they are sometimes colloquially referred to as oil burners. An early pioneer of this form of engine was James Holden, of Britain's Great Eastern Railway. In James Holden's system, steam was raised by burning coal before the oil fuel was turned on.http://www.lner.info/co/GER/locomotives.shtml Conversion Some oil- burning engines were originally designed to be coal powered but were converted. When a coal-burning steam locomotive is converted to burn oil, various modifications are usual: # the grate is covered with broken firebrick to act as a reservoir of heat. If the oil flame is blown out (e.g. by a downdraft when entering a tunnel) the hot firebrick will re-ignite it # the lower part of the inner firebox is lined with firebrick # shorter superheater elements are fitted The latter two changes are needed because oil firing produces higher temperatures than coal firing, and can cause rapid erosion of metal. For a similar reason, the smokebox is sometimes painted with silver- coloured heat-resisting paint.

Schreiber, Die antiken Bildwerke der Villa Ludovisi, Rome 1880, p. 5). The overgrown avenues contrasting with the dramatic Roman walls inspired Stendhal to declare in 1828 that the Villa Ludovisi's gardens were among the most beautiful in the world.Stendhal, Promenades dans Rome (18 April 1828), in Voyages en Italie. Frescoes in the villa were carried out by Domenichino, Guercino, Giovambattista Viola, and others.

The villa passed to the ownership of the Boncompagni Ludovisi family, which in 1872 rented it to King Victor Emmanuel II.

All three crew members and 15 passengers on board perished. The subsequent investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the cause of the accident was the captain's premature descent below the minimum descent altitude, carried out without having the runway in sight. The accident's investigation also brought into focus several generic safety issues, such as pressure applied on charter pilots by customers, night flight into airports near mountainous terrain, and the ambiguity of some Federal Aviation Administration rules.Robert P. Mark, \\"Aspen crash prompts approach controversy\\", AIN Online, August 2002 Flight history The captain and first officer reported for work at Avjet's Burbank, California facility around noon on the day of the accident. After checking the weather and the aircraft, they embarked on an 11-minute repositioning flight to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to pick up their passengers. The flight was originally scheduled to leave LAX at 16:30 MST, but departed after a 41-minute delay for late passengers at 17:11 MST. Earlier in the day, an FAA specialist had informed the crew that it would be illegal to land at night in Aspen under instrument flight rules. In addition, the crew were aware that due to noise abatement restrictions, their jet aircraft was required to land at Aspen by the 18:58 MST night curfew. Following the delayed departure from LAX, their estimated arrival time was 18:46 MST, twelve minutes before the curfew took effect. As the flight approached Aspen‚ÄìPitkin County Airport, it became evident that some of the other inbound flights were performing missed approaches, as they had been unable to complete an instrument approach to the airport's runway. The airport is surrounded by high terrain on all sides and a fairly steep descent is required in order to land. At 18:56:06 MST, the flight was cleared for the VOR/DME-C instrument approach to the airport, whereupon it proceeded to the Red Table VOR, executed a sequence of designated step-down maneuvers and began final approach to the runway. As it continued its descent past the missed approach point ‚Äì where the runway must be in sight to continue ‚Äì the pilots had still not visually located the runway in the increasing darkness and snow showers. At 19:01:57 MST, while in a steep left bank, the aircraft crashed into the terrain, killing all 18 persons on board.  Investigation and final report  Profile view of N303GA's approach to Aspen (NTSB report). Following the crash, the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder was recovered from the wreckage and the data recorded found to be intact and usable. Under Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 Air Taxi rules, no flight data recorder was required for this type of flight and one had not been installed. Part of the subsequent NTSB investigation focused on the fact that the instrument approach at the destination airport was not legal for night landing, and the overall pressure applied on the charter company and flight crew by the charter customer to complete the flight into the original destination. According to witnesses, the charter customer, upon learning that the flight might have to be diverted to an alternate airport due to the night landing restriction, had his business assistant call Avjet management, to \\"let them know that the airplane was not going to be redirected\\". In addition, witnesses claimed that when the charter customer learned that the captain had discussed the possible diversion with some of the passengers waiting for the late arrivals, he had his assistant call Avjet to instruct the captain to \\"keep his comments to himself\\". The Avjet charter department scheduler subsequently testified that \\"the captain felt that it was important to land at [Aspen] because of the substantial amount of money that the [charter] customer spent for a dinner party\\". A daytime fair weather view of the approach to runway 15 at Aspen airport, depicting accident site of N303GA (NTSB report). Based on information obtained from the cockpit voice recorder, the flight attendant had escorted an unidentified male passenger to the flight deck's jump seat during the approach sequence. According to the NTSB's analysis, \\"the presence of this passenger in the cockpit, especially if it were the charter customer, most likely further heightened the pressure on the flight crew to land at [Aspen]\\". The NTSB issued its final report on June 11, 2002, with the following probable cause: > The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause > of this accident was the flight crew's operation of the airplane below the > minimum descent altitude without an appropriate visual reference for the > runway. The NTSB added the following contributing factors: > Contributing to the cause of the accident were the Federal Aviation > Administration's (FAA) unclear wording of the March 27, 2001 Notice to > Airmen regarding the nighttime restriction for the VOR/DME-C approach to the > airport and the FAA's failure to communicate this restriction to the Aspen > tower; the inability of the flight crew to adequately see the mountainous > terrain because of the darkness and the weather conditions; and the pressure > on the captain to land from the charter customer and because of the > airplane's delayed departure and the airport's nighttime landing > restriction. Aftermath After the accident, Avjet decided to prohibit airport operations at Aspen and three other mountainous airports between sunset and sunrise. It also issued the following memorandum to its flight crews and schedulers: > \\"if you cannot accomplish a landing and be on the ground at one of these > airports before sunset you must divert to a suitable alternate. All > passengers for one of these destinations must be informed of this policy. > Flight crew members must report any violation of this policy or pressure > from passengers to violate this policy to the Director of Operations or > Chief Pilot.\\" Avjet also added the following policy to its operations manual after the accident: > \\"Only an Avjet assigned crewmember, check airman, or FAA observer may occupy > the observer's seat (jump seat) in any Avjet aircraft. Charter passengers > shall never be allowed to occupy the observer's seat at any time.\\"  Litigation  A wrongful death lawsuit was filed by the families of three of the victims in Los Angeles. After a jury found the captain and Avjet Corporation negligent, an out-of-court settlement was reached, where Avjet agreed to pay the plaintiffs a total of US$11.7M in damages.\\"Aspen crash victims awarded $11.7M\\", The Denver Business Journal, July 8, 2003 There were reportedly also other settlements for other victims.\\"Charter company to pay USD11.7m to relatives of 2001 crash victims\\", Airline Industry Information, July 8, 2003  See also  *List of accidents and incidents on commercial aircraft  References  Further reading *Christina Ward, \\"Charter Plane Crash Kills 18 Near Aspen\\", RedCross.org, March 30, 2001 *Gordon Gilbert, \\"Fuel and weather suspect in Aspen GIII accident\\", AIN Online, November 2001 *Gordon Gilbert, \\"Editors' Choice: Gulfstream III crew in Aspen crash\\" AIN Online, January 2002 *  External links  *Avjet Corporation *CNN Rush Transcript on accident *GoogleMaps aerial photo of KASE airport *AirNav record for KASE ‚Äì note 'Additional Remarks' *Airliners.net Photo of accident aircraft N303GA, on June 2, 2000 in Budapest, Hungary Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 2001 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Colorado Category:Pitkin County, Colorado Category:2001 in Colorado Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving controlled flight into terrain Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by pilot error Category:March 2001 events in the United States ","title":"2001 Avjet Aspen crash"},{"id":"7062765","text":"Cornelis Nay reached the Kara Sea in August 1594 Cornelis Corneliszoon Nay was a Dutch navigator and explorer who attempted to discover the Northeast Passage from Europe to the Far East. Nay hailed from Enkhuizen in The Netherlands. In June 1594, he set out from the Dutch island of Texel with a small fleet (consisting of three ships and a fishing boat) to discover the Northeast Passage. Nay commanded the ship De Zwaan. Fellow explorer Willem Barentsz, who commanded another of the ships (as well as the fishing boat), followed the coast of Novaya Zemlya, but his progress was halted by the ice. Nay was more successful: he passed through the Kara Strait (south of Novaya Zemlya) and reached the Kara Sea. Nay's success led to a second expedition the following year (1595) with a larger fleet, consisting of seven ships. The expedition was under the command of Nay (something to which Barentsz was strongly opposed). Having left too late in the season, the explorers were soon stopped by the ice. Barentsz wanted to stop for the winter and continue in the spring, but Nay decided that the fleet should return home. The Dutch government considered the expedition a total flop and refused to fund a new expedition. Nevertheless, a third attempt was made the next year, in 1596 - this time without Nay. This was the famed expedition during which Barentsz and his men managed to survive the winter on Novaya Zemlya, though Barentsz died on the way home. Although Nay and Barentsz failed to find the passage to the East by way of the Arctic Sea, the Dutch journeys of exploration in the Arctic paved the way for large-scale whale and seal fishery which greatly enriched the Netherlands during the Dutch Golden Age.

Early life Grinnell was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts on March 3, 1803. He was the son of Cornelius Grinnell (1758‚Äì1850) and Sylvia (n√©e Howland) Grinnell (1765‚Äì1837). His siblings included Henry Grinnell and Joseph Grinnell. After attending public schools, he took his first paying job at the age of 15, working in a \\"counting room\\" in New York City. Shipping career In 1815, his brother Joseph Grinnell helped to establish the shipping firm Grinnell, Minturn & Co. Moses and brother Henry Grinnell became members of the firm in 1825. In 1830, Robert Bowne Minturn joinged the firm and it became Grinnell & Minturn. The company stayed active until 1880. Grinnell became a successful New York merchant and shipper and was subsequently appointed as president of the New York Chamber of Commerce. The pilot boat Moses H. Grinnell, was built in 1850 for the Jersey pilots and designed by George Steers. She was owned by George W. Blunt of New York. The Grinnell was the first pilot boat to show the fully developed long entry that was to become the New York schooner's trade mark. The shipping company is best known for owning the clipper ship Flying Cloud. Grinnell bought her from Donald McKay in 1851 for $90,000. Political career However, unlike his brother Joseph Grinnell, who represented Massachusetts for four terms as a Whig, Moses did not stick to a single political party. He was first a Democrat, then became a Whig in the 1830s, was an \\"out-and-out Native American party man\\" the 1840s, and in the 1850s joined the newly founded Republican Party, for which he served as a presidential elector in 1856. In February 1860, president-elect Abraham Lincoln, on his way to Washington, D.C., visited the Manhattan home of Grinnell's daughter, whose father had invited many of New York City's most prominent businessmen to meet the first Republican president. Grinnell subsequently wrote Lincoln with introductions for others, becoming something of a conduit of political power, if not a wielder of such himself. Grinnell was Collector of the Port of New York from March 1869 to July 1870, and the Port's Naval Officer of Customs from July 1870 to April 1871. Perhaps best remembered for his work as Central Park Commissioner during the early years of the urban park's design and construction. Personal life Moses Grinnell died in Manhattan on November 24, 1877. His funeral service was at the Unitarian Church of All Souls and he was buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Sleepy Hollow, New York.

C. Worsley, was a British teacher, writer, editor, and theatre and television critic. He is best remembered for his autobiographical Flannelled Fool: A Slice of a Life in the Thirties. Biography Cuthbert Worsley was born on 10 December 1907 in Durham, the son of a rising Anglican clergyman. He was the third of four sons, with one sister. His father, F. W. Worsley‚Äîa Doctor of Divinity, a holder of the Military Cross, a former holder of the English long jump record and obsessive sportsman, and eventually Dean of Llandaff Cathedral‚Äîwas a dominating but dysfunctional force in family life until his abrupt desertion, with two suitcases, of both family and deanery, when Worsley was a university student. Worsley was educated initially at the Llandaff Cathedral school, transferring later to nearby Brightlands preparatory school from which he won two scholarships to Marlborough College. While at home from Marlborough during a summer vacation Worsley's younger brother Benjamin drowned at the seaside, an event incalculably traumatic for Worsley: > however gentle everyone was with me, I had the facts to face. I was alive > and he was dead. He, the specially beloved of them all, the little genius, > the most precious of any of us, hadn't survived. I had. And how could I > forget that in the final climax of that deadly crisis, I had cast him off? I > had torn myself free. If I hadn't, there would, of course, have been two > deaths instead of one. True. But I had, I had actually, physically, > deliberately, wilfully torn his clutching hands away from my thighs. Are > such traumas ever healed? Was I ever to be released from dreams in which > such a thing had not happened? Or in which it turned out differently? In > which I could swim and, swimming on my back, brought him to the shore as in > the illustrations in the manuals? Would I ever be able to persuade myself > that my story‚Äîaccepted so willingly by the family‚Äîthat I couldn't swim was > true, when I had swum, I had swum thirty or forty yards to that rocky point > and had got there‚Äîalone? According to one account,John Richardson, The Sorcerer's apprentice, London, 1999 this tragedy transformed Cuthbert into somewhat of a bore: when he was with a lover he would weep all the time, giving vent to his sense of guilt. At Marlborough, following a year of general education, his studies were exclusively Classical and led to a scholarship at St John's College, Cambridge from which, though he initially read Classics, he graduated in English with a third-class degree. Throughout his school and university careers he was a successful cricketer, and his academic studies at Cambridge were neglected; but his sporting prowess helped him, immediately on graduating in 1929, to a position as schoolmaster at Wellington College. The story of his challenges to the traditions of the school is told in Flannelled Fool. With Stephen Spender he went to Spain during the Spanish Civil War, some of his experiences being recorded decades later in Fellow Travellers. His The End of the Old School Tie (1941) was published as part of the Searchlight Books series edited by Tosco Fyvel and George Orwell. He later worked for the left-wing magazine New Statesman as assistant to Raymond Mortimer the literary editor, and drama critic. In 1958 he moved to the Financial Times as theatre and television critic. He suffered from emphysema and died on 23 February 1977 in Kemp Town, Brighton.

The Assam Accord was a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) signed between representatives of the Government of India and the leaders of the Assam Movement. It was signed in the presence of the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in New Delhi on 15 August 1985. Later Citizenship Act was amended for the first time in the next year, 1986.Text of Assam Accord, according to the Part II (A) The Assam Gazette 23 June 2015, pp 7Assam Accord SATP.org Archives It followed a six-year agitation that started in 1979. Led by the All Assam Students‚Äô Union (AASU), the protestors demanded the identification and deportation of all illegal foreigners ‚Äì predominantly Bangladeshi immigrants. They feared the past and continuing large scale migration was overwhelming the native population, impacting their political rights, culture, language and land rights. The Assam Movement caused the estimated death of over 855 people. The movement ended with the signing of the Assam Accord. The leaders of the Assam Movement agreed to accept all migrants who had entered into Assam prior to January 1 1966. The Government of India acknowledged the political, social, cultural and economic concerns of the Assamese people and agreed to revise the electoral database based on that date. Further, the government agreed to identify and deport any and all refugees and migrants after March 25 1971. In 1971, millions of citizens of Bangladesh ‚Äì then called East Pakistan ‚Äì fled the abuses of a civil war and associated genocide between East Pakistan and West Pakistan triggering mass illegal migration into Assam, West Bengal, various other nearby states of India as well as Myanmar. According to the Assam Accord, the Government of India agreed to secure the international border against future infiltration by the \\"erection of physical barriers like walls, barbed wire fencing and other obstacles at appropriate places\\" and deploying a patrol by security forces on land and river routes all along the international Bangladesh-India border. To aid this effort, the Government also agreed to build a road near the border for the patrol and quicker deployment of Indian security forces, as well as maintain a mandatory birth and death list of citizens. All open police charges against the participants and the leaders of the Assam Movement, prior to and on the date of signing the Accord, were also withdrawn and closed. The families of those who died during the Assam Movement were given monetary compensation. The Government also agreed to open an oil refinery, reopen paper mills and establish educational institutions in the state. The accord brought an end to the Assam Movement and paved the way for the leaders of the agitation to form a political party and form a government in the state of Assam soon after. Though the accord brought an end to the agitation, some of the key clauses are yet to be implemented, which kept some of the issues festering.AASU questions Govts‚Äô sincerity on Accord , The Assam Tribune, 13 May 2007. According to Sanjib Baruah ‚Äì a professor of Political Studies, the task of identifying foreigners became politically difficult, affected vote banks, and attracted accusations of religious or ethnic discrimination. Hiteswar Saikia, a chief minister of Assam in early 1990s and senior Congress party leader, for example gave conflicting statements in his speeches. In the front of some crowds, he denied there were any foreigners; before other crowds, he said there were hundreds of thousands of illegal foreigners in Assam that need to be deported. In 1997, the state government completed a study and marked numerous names in its voter list with \\"d\\" meaning \\"disputed citizenship\\", with plans to block them from voting. Critics complained of disenfranchisement. The High Court of the state ascertained that the \\"d\\" is based on suspicion, not documentary evidence. All residents ‚Äì citizens and foreigners ‚Äì were allowed to vote in subsequent Assam elections. The supporters of the Assam Movement stated that the government has failed to implement the Assam Accord.

A one-shot comic title of the same name was written by Dwayne McDuffie, Ivan Velez Jr. and Robert Washington. Publication history In the summer of 1994, DC Comics and Milestone Media published an intercompany crossover called Worlds Collide. It featured a meeting between Metropolis- based superheroes from the DC Universe and Dakota-based superheroes from the Dakotaverse. Unlike many intercompany crossovers, it was intended to be part of the regular continuity and took place in the monthly issues of the involved series. The situation was somewhat complicated by the fact that in the Dakotaverse, DC superheroes such as Superman were known as fictional characters from comic books. Although the crossover initially had no lasting consequences in DC continuity (DC's Zero Hour event cancelled out everything before), it was remembered by Milestone's superheroes. Plot A postal worker named Fred Bentson unwittingly becomes a portal between two worlds and two cities. A living link between Dakota, home city of the Milestone heroes, and Metropolis, home of Superman. Eventually Bentson loses control of his powers and transforms into Rift, a cosmic being capable of manipulating and reconfiguring matter on a subatomic scale. The heroes of the two universes come together to stop him and seal the dangerous rift between their worlds. Revised continuity In 2008, the continuity of the Milestone characters was modified. Dakota City and the Dakotaverse characters were placed within the mainstream DC universe. Static encounters the Terror Titans, which leads to his eventual membership with their heroic counterparts, the Teen Titans. The Shadow Cabinet‚Äîalong with Hardware, Icon and Rocket‚Äîclashes with the Justice League of America. It is revealed that Icon and Superman are acquainted and have tremendous respect for each other. Additionally, it becomes apparent that the Cooperative (from which Icon hails) is known to the Green Lantern Corps and the Guardians of the Universe, but is exempt from their jurisdiction. Eventually, the being known as Dharma explains the origin of the revised continuity to Icon and Superman. Following the death of Darkseid (as chronicled in Final Crisis), the space-time continuum was torn asunder, threatening the existence of both the Dakotaverse and the mainstream DC universe. Dharma was able to use energies that he harnessed from Rift (upon that being's defeat) to merge the two universes, creating an entirely new continuity. Only Dharma, Icon and Superman are aware that Dakota and its inhabitants ever existed in a parallel universe.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #34 (August 2009) Bibliography *Part 1 ‚Äì Superman: The Man of Steel #35 *Part 2 ‚Äì Hardware #17 *Part 3 ‚Äì Superboy #6 *Part 4 ‚Äì Icon #15 *Part 5 ‚Äì Steel #6 *Part 6 ‚Äì Blood Syndicate #16 *Part 7 ‚Äì Worlds Collide #1 *Part 8 ‚Äì Superboy #7 *Part 9 ‚Äì Hardware #18 *Part 10 ‚Äì Superman: The Man of Steel #36 *Part 11 ‚Äì Icon #16 *Part 12 ‚Äì Steel #7 *Part 13 ‚Äì Blood Syndicate #17 *Part 14 ‚Äì Static #14 References External links *Milestone Title Index Category:Intercompany crossovers Category:Comics about parallel universes ","title":"Worlds Collide (comics)"},{"id":"7062917","text":"Mabel Fairbanks (November 14, 1915 ‚Äì September 29, 2001) was an American figure skater and coach. As an African American and Native American woman she paved the way for other minorities to compete in the sport of figure skating such as Naomi Lang. She was inducted into the US Figure Skating Hall of Fame, as the first person of African American and Native American descent, and the International Women's Sports Hall of Fame.  Early life  Mabel Fairbanks was born on November 14, 1915 in Florida's Everglades. Her father was African American while her mother was a Native American of English descent. In a 1999 interview, she said, \\"my mother took in everybody ‚Äì every kid off the street ‚Äì and gave them a place to stay and something to eat. So I never knew who were my real sisters and brothers, but my older sister told me there were 14.\\" Fairbanks was orphaned at the age of eight when her mother died. After staying with a teacher who treated her like a \\"maid,\\" she joined one of her brothers in New York City. She worked for him and his wife at their fish market on 8th Avenue in Harlem but they became displeased when, out of sympathy, she gave a family more fish than they had paid for. A wealthy woman saw her sleeping on a park bench and offered her a job as a babysitter at a home overlooking Central Park.  Career  Fairbanks began figure skating around 1925 to 1928. After observing children at the Central Park ice rink, she bought herself used skates, stuffed them with cotton because they were two sizes too big, and began skating at the rink. She said, \\"Blacks didn't skate there. But it was a public place, so I just carried on.\\" She gained further inspiration after seeing Sonja Henie in the 1936 film One in a Million. In the 1930s, Fairbanks, due to her race, was denied access to the local rink by the cashier but she kept returning until the manager admitted her. Maribel Vinson Owen and Howard Nicholson provided her with technical advice. Fairbanks was not allowed to compete in the national qualifying event for the Olympics or any competition. In a 1998 interview, she said, \\"If I had gone to the Olympics and become a star, I would not be who I am today.\\" Fairbanks performed in shows in New York until the 1940s. She often wore pink or purple skate boots rather than the more common black or white. She practiced on a 6 ft by 6 ft rink constructed by her uncle Wally in her room. After relocating to Los Angeles, she toured internationally, skating with Ice Capades in Mexico and later with Ice Follies. After returning to the United States, she saw a sign with \\"Colored Trade Not Solicited\\" at the Pasadena Winter Gardens. She stated, \\"my uncle had newspaper articles written about it and passed them out everywhere until they finally let me in.\\" Fairbanks coached singles and pairs, including Tiffany Chin, Billy Chapel, Scott Hamilton, Kristi Yamaguchi / Rudy Galindo, Tai Babilonia / Randy Gardner, Leslie Robinson, Michelle McCladdie, Richard Ewell, Debi Thomas, Atoy Wilson, and Jean Yuna. She also taught skating to the children of many celebrities. In 1997, she became the first African American inducted into the US Figure Skating Hall of Fame. She was inducted into the International Women's Sports Hall of Fame in October 2001.  Personal life  Fairbanks never married. She was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis in 1997 and with acute leukemia in mid-2001. She died on September 29, 2001 at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California. She is interred in the ground at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Hollywood, California. Her grave is right at the beginning of the bridge to the Clark Mausoleum.

S√£o F√©lix is the north of the two hills east of the city, the other being Cividade Hill. S√£o F√©lix is located in the civil parish of Laundos, and is a sequence of Serra de Rates mountain range. In the Middle Ages the hill was known as Lanudos, hence the name of the civil parish. Despite its low height, S√£o F√©lix is easily distinguished in the landscape because it is a significant rise in front of a coastal plain. Alto River's source is located in S√£o F√©lix Hill and ends at Rio Alto Beach in Estela. Myths and religion Senhora da Sa√∫de Shrine. Our Lady of Good Health and Saint F√©lix are venerated in the hill. The hill is of ancient cult to the people of P√≥voa de Varzim, especially the fishermen, as it was used as a reference from the sea. It is one of the sacred hills of Northern Portugal, sacro-monte in Portuguese. It has several temples: Senhora da Sa√∫de chapel, Senhora da Sa√∫de Sanctuary, the small S√£o F√©lix Chapel, 12 sideway shrines, and the main S√£o F√©lix Chapel in the top of the hill. While Senhora da Sa√∫de temples are located in the base, the ones from S√£o F√©lix are located higher in the hill. It is also the main pilgrimage site of P√≥voa de Varzim and Vila do Conde, especially important for the fisher community, who walk a 7 km long way from the Matriz Church of P√≥voa de Varzim to Senhora da Sa√∫de Shrine.

In a local myth, that became important for Christianity in the Iberian Peninsula, F√©lix is thought to have found the body of the first bishop of the Iberian Peninsula, Saint Peter of Rates, in the hilltop while seeing a light every evening. This myth was used by Braga clergy in order to justify that city's religious leading role in Christian Iberia. Castro culture ruins The hill has ruins of a small castro settlement of around the 2nd century B.C known as Castro de Laundos, that could have been an outpost of Cividade de Terroso. A vase with jewels inside, used in a Castro culture death ritual, was found in 1904 this is one of the most important jewelry artifacts found in Northwest Iberian Peninsula. Tourism The hill has iconic panoramic view over the city, its rural area, and beaches; mills (some converted into holiday houses), and the Cividade Hill. The Rates Shooting Camp is located nearby.

During World War II, he organized the first U.S. Navy Demolition Teams, which later gave rise to the SEALs. His wartime service also included participation in the invasions of Saipan, Tinian, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Childhood and education Draper L. Kauffman, the son of Vice Admiral James L. Kauffman, was born in San Diego, California, on 4 August 1911. He attended St. Albans School in Washington, D.C., and Kent School in Kent, Connecticut and was appointed to the United States Naval Academy from Ohio in 1929.Rear Admiral Draper L. Kauffman, Bio File, Operational Archives, Naval Historical Center. Kauffman graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1933, but poor eyesight denied him a commission in the regular Navy. World War II Volunteer service in Europe, 1940‚Äì1941 Employed by the United States Lines Steamship Company, his travels in Europe alerted him to the danger of Nazi Germany. In February 1940, he joined the American Volunteer Ambulance Corps in France. On 16 June, he was captured by the Germans and held prisoner for two months. Released in August, he made his way to England and was commissioned a sub-lieutenant in the British Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve, later rising to lieutenant. At the height of the Blitz on London (1940‚Äì1941), he served as a bomb and mine disposal officer, and achieved a high degree of proficiency in bomb disposal techniques. U.S. Navy service, 1941‚Äì1945 Securing a U.S. Naval Reserve commission a month before Pearl Harbor, Kauffman was rushed to Hawaii after the Japanese attack, and there disarmed an enemy bomb, the first to be recovered intact for study. For this action, the Navy awarded him a Navy Cross. In January 1942, he was assigned the task of organizing a U.S. Naval Bomb Disposal School at the Washington Navy Yard. This school is one of the forefathers to the Explosive Ordnance Disposal School (NAVSCOLEOD) at the Kauffman Training Facility at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, which is managed by the Navy and staffed by all services to train the Department of Defense EOD technicians. As an additional duty he assisted the U.S. Army in setting up a comparable school at Aberdeen, Maryland. In June 1943, he organized the first U.S. Navy Demolition Teams, which later became the well-known Underwater Demolition Teams (the forerunner of the SEALs) and received orders as the first commanding officer of the Naval Combat Demolition Unit, Naval Amphibious Training Base, Fort Pierce, Florida. While there, he also organized and was the first chairman of the Joint Army-Navy Experimental and Testing Board (JANET). In April 1944, he was ordered to the Pacific Fleet and served at the Naval Combat Demolition Training and Experimental Base, Maui, Hawaii as the commanding officer of Underwater Demolition Team 5 (UDT 5); as senior staff officer, Underwater Demolition Teams, Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet; and as Underwater Demolition Training Officer, Amphibious Training Command, Pacific Fleet. As commander of UDT 5, he participated in the invasion of Saipan, and received a second Navy Cross for leading his team in a daylight reconnaissance of fortified enemy beaches under heavy fire, and on 10 July 1944, leading a night reconnaissance of heavily defended beaches at Tinian island. During World War II, Kauffman also participated in the assaults on Iwo Jima and Okinawa as Commander Underwater Demolition Teams. On two occasions, he had to transfer from a damaged ship to another to carry on operations. In one such occasion at Iwo Jima in 1945, after an enemy aircraft bombed his ship and started a raging fire, he directed fire control efforts in the face of exploding ammunition. Cold War naval career His first postwar assignment came in February 1946 when he was assigned to Joint Task Force One, the organization which conducted \\"Operation Crossroads\\", the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. Later under the CNO, as head of the Defense and Protection Section, he established the U.S. Navy Radiological Safety School, and aided in setting up a comparable school for the Army. From October to December 1947, he was assigned to the carrier and was aboard her during her round-the-world cruise in 1948. Following a month's instruction at the Fleet Sonar School in Key West, Florida, he commanded the destroyer from December 1948 until July 1950, when he entered the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. Upon completion of the logistics course in June 1951, he remained for two years as a member of the Strategy and Tactics Staff. In June 1953, he assumed command of Destroyer Division 122. In 1954, Kauffman served in the Strategic Plans Division under the CNO, and in 1955 was appointed Aide to the Under Secretary of the Navy and later Secretary of the Navy, Thomas S. Gates, Jr.. In August 1957, he assumed command of the attack transport which he commanded until August 1958 when he was ordered to duty as Assistant Chief of Staff for Plans on the staff of the Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet. In January 1960, he commanded the heavy cruiser . In July 1960, Kauffman was selected as Rear Admiral, and he became Commander Destroyer Flotilla Three (later redesignated Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla Three). In 1962, he became Chief of the Strategic Plans and Policy Division. In 1965, he became the 44th Superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy, where he served for three years. His next assignment was as the Commander of the U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines, and Representative of the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific, a billet once filled 25 years earlier by his father. In June 1970, he became commandant of the 9th Naval District, headquartered at Great Lakes Naval Station, Illinois, with an additional duty as Commander of the Station. Rear Admiral Kauffman retired from the Navy on 1 June 1973 and became the 9th president of Marion Military Institute from 1974 to 1976. He died in 1979. Legacy The , launched in 1987, was named in honor of Draper Kauffman and his father, Vice Admiral James L. Kauffman (1887‚Äì1963). His roles as the founder of U.S. Naval Bomb Disposal and as the founder of the UDT/SEALs were also commemorated in the creation of the Kauffman EOD Training Complex at Eglin AFB, Florida, and the Draper L. Kauffman Naval Special Warfare Operations Facility in Norfolk, Virginia. His great-niece named her first-born child after her great uncle. Professor Kelsey Kauffman, of DePauw University, is his daughter and is an author. Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, founder of SumOfUs, is a granddaughter.

It is located about 12 km southwest of Tilburg. The village itself has about 2960 inhabitants; the countryside that belongs to the village has a population of about 1040. This includes the hamlets 't Zand, Alphen-Oosterwijk, Druisdijk, Looneind, Boslust, Hondseind, Het Sas, Terover, Boshoven and Kwaalburg. According to the 19th-century historian A.J. van der Aa, Alphen was first mentioned in 711, when a nobleman named Engelbrecht sold \\"Alfheim\\" to Saint Willibrord. In 726, it was sold on to the Abbey of Echternach. In 1545 it was burned to the ground by the army of Guelders under Maarten van Rossum, and in later wars it suffered from destruction and looting as well. Until 1997, Alphen was the main village of the municipality of Alphen en Riel.

It is the 46th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot After being acquitted on a charge of chicken stealing, the Stooges attempt to catch a live fish from a pet store aquarium tank. A beat cop (Bud Jamison) catches them in action and gives chase, forcing the boys to pose as plumbers to avoid being incarcerated. The Stooges manage to destroy the entire plumbing system in the home in grand fashion. Curly attempts to repair a leak in the upstairs bathroom and ends up constructing a maze of pipes that traps him. Larry digs up the front lawn in fruitless search of the water shutoff valve. In addition, Moe and Curly end up connecting a water pipe with another nearby pipe housing electrical wires, leading to water exiting every electrical appliance in the mansion, resulting in much comedic suffering for the mansion‚Äôs bewildered chef (Dudley Dickerson). When a hostess invites her guests to watch Niagara Falls on her new television set, the whole company gets doused with water (therefore leading to the invention of 4-D television). The homeowner arrives to see his house in shambles and accidentally undoes the Stooges' convoluted repair work. As they are about to reprimand him, it becomes clear that the homeowner happens to be the judge who found them innocent a few hours earlier; in the last scene the Three Stooges are running away while being chased by the Judge, his butler and the police. Production notes A Plumbing We Will Go was filmed on December 13‚Äì18, 1939. It was the last Stooge short filmed in the 1930s. It was a remake of Sidney & Murray's 1934, short Plumbing for Gold and would be remade again with El Brendel and Shemp Howard as Pick a Peck of Plumbers in 1944. The Stooges remade A Plumbing We Will Go as Vagabond Loafers and Scheming Schemers using stock footage. The original story in Plumbing for Gold involved searching for a lost ring which the Stooges did not use until Scheming Schemers. Curly would recreate the maze-of-pipes gag several years later in Swing Parade of 1946. Shemp Howard attempted it as well in Vagabond Loafers and Scheming Schemers, while Joe DeRita also attempted the gag in Have Rocket, Will Travel. The chicken-stealing segment that opens the film was also reworked in Listen, Judge. Aside from the aforementioned reworked films, footage from A Plumbing We Will Go also reappeared in the 1960 compilation feature film Stop! Look! and Laugh!. Like A Ducking They Did Go, the title is a play on the children's song, \\"A-Hunting We Will Go\\". Reception A Plumbing We Will Go is considered a quintessential Three Stooges film. Ranking as a consistent fan favorite, the film was also a favorite of star Curly Howard. As of 2010, A Plumbing We Will Go is the highest-rated Three Stooges film on the Internet Movie Database.

Her keel was laid down on 2 July 1962 at Bath, Maine, by the Bath Iron Works Corporation. She was launched on 25 April 1965 sponsored by Mrs. Richard W. Wainwright; and commissioned on 8 January 1966 at the Boston Naval Shipyard with Captain Robert P. Foreman in command.  Shakedown  Between January and May, the guided missile cruiser completed her outfitting at Boston, Massachusetts. On 21 May, she departed Boston, initially to test the Navy's newest sonar equipment and then to proceed to her home port, Charleston, South Carolina. During the months of June, July, and early August, she operated out of that port along the eastern seaboard and in the West Indies. During this period, she made six highly successful missile firings on the Atlantic Fleet weapon range and conducted a three-day search for an unidentified submarine contact. Though no positive identification of the submarine could be made, Wainwright did establish contact with her new long-range sonar and then tracked the vessel for a time. On 13 August, the ship returned to Charleston for 15 days of upkeep in preparation for shakedown training, upon which she embarked on 28 August. At the conclusion of shakedown, she proceeded to Culebra Island for both gun and Terrier missile shoots. She returned to Charleston in October to prepare for the annual Atlantic Fleet exercise. On 28 November, the guided missile cruiser stood out of Charleston for 17 days of drills, including replenishment exercises, weapon coordination drills, and formation steaming maneuvers and tactics. She returned home on 16 December and ended the year in a leave and upkeep status.  Vietnam War  On 6 January 1967, Wainwright got underway for Boston and post-shakedown availability. She concluded that repair period and headed back to Charleston on 15 March. Following local operations there, the guided missile destroyer embarked upon her first deployment to the western Pacific on 10 April. She transited the Panama Canal a week later and arrived in San Diego, California, on 23 April. For almost a month, she conducted exercises off the coast of southern California before heading west on 15 May. After brief stops at Pearl Harbor and Guam, Wainwright entered Subic Bay in the Philippines on 3 June. Three days later, she arrived on station in the Tonkin Gulf and, on 8 June, took over positive identification radar advisory zone (PIRAZ) duties from . In that capacity, Wainwright maintained constant radar and visual surveillance of the gulf and adjoining coasts for the purpose of identifying all aircraft in the zone and vectoring defensive forces to the interception of any possible airborne enemy intruders. Because of the relative immobility necessary to those duties, she also served as a reference point to guide American strike aircraft to their targets ashore. Since her duties afforded her a continual picture of the events occurring in the air over the zone, she also served as a base for search and rescue (SAR) helicopters. During that first line period, one SAR helicopter crashed Wainwrights flight deck area; but the damage proved to be minimal, and the destroyer was able to resume full-scale flight operations the following day. Damage to the superstructure of the helicopter storage compartment consisted of a gash provided by a helicopter blade. The helicopter was ordered to be pushed over the side as a result of the damage to it. After a one-week upkeep period out of a scheduled two week period at Sasebo, Japan, Wainwright was called back to PIRAZ duty secondary to a fire aboard in July 1967. Wainwright resumed PIRAZ duty on 12 August. Her 27 days on station ended on 8 September when she cleared the gulf for a five-day visit to Hong Kong. On 15 September, she stood out of the British colony to return to Vietnamese waters. During that third and final tour, she served as a screen commander for two of the attack aircraft carriers operating on \\"Yankee Station\\" located in the southern reaches of the Tonkin Gulf as well as antiaircraft warfare command ship for all of Task Force (TF) 77. On 28 September, Wainwright completed her final assignment in the combat zone and departed the Tonkin Gulf. En route home, she visited Subic Bay; Sydney, Australia; Wellington, New Zealand; and Tahiti. The warship retransited the Panama Canal on 12 November and reentered Charleston four days later. The guided missile destroyer ended 1967 and began 1968 at Charleston. On 19 January 1968, she exited her home port and headed for Newport, Rhode Island, where she served as school ship for the Destroyer School from 21 January to 3 February before returning to Charleston on 5 February. Her operations from her home port, including Operation \\"Rugby Match\\" exercises in the West Indies, lasted until she sailed for the western Pacific on 24 June. The warship transited the Panama Canal on 29 June, stopped briefly at Pearl Harbor from 11 to 15 July and at Guam on 21 July, and arrived at Subic Bay on 26 July. Four days later, she embarked upon the first tour of combat duty of her 1968 deployment. She stopped at Da Nang for briefings on 2 August and then relieved on PIRAZ station on 4 August. During the following 41 days, she left her station only once -- to evade a typhoon -- and returned immediately after the storm passed. On 14 September, she turned PIRAZ duties back over to Sterett and steamed off for a month of port visits which included a brief upkeep period at Subic Bay followed by calls at Hong Kong and Yokosuka. On 13 October, she headed from Japan directly to the PIRAZ station and relieved Sterett once more. The 27 days of her second line period passed even more routinely than those of the first, and she cleared the Tonkin Gulf on 15 November for a four-day upkeep in Sasebo from 19 to 23 November. Back on station on 28 November, Wainwright concluded the year as the Navy's air coordinator in the northern portion of the Tonkin Gulf. The warship spent the first three days of 1969 winding up her third and final tour of duty as PIRAZ ship and then set a course for the Philippines, the first pause on her way home. After stopping at Subic Bay from 5 to 9 January, she continued her roundabout voyage to Charleston, stopping along the way at Sydney, Australia; Auckland, New Zealand; and Papeete, Tahiti. She passed back through the Panama Canal on 11 February, stopped at St. Thomas for a two-day visit on 15 February, and reached Charleston on 21 February. Following a month of leave and upkeep, Wainwright underwent a whole series of inspections at Charleston that spring. During the middle of May, she steamed north to Norfolk, Virginia, where she participated in the Presidential Seapower Demonstration conducted in the Virginia Capes operating area. At the conclusion of that event on 19 May, she headed south for the multifaceted combat exercise, \\"Exotic Dancer.\\" For the first two weeks of June, Wainwright remained in the West Indies and participated in the NATO anti-submarine warfare exercise, \\"Spark Plug\\", along with ships of the navies of Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Portugal. That exercise ended on 11 June, and the destroyer proceeded to Newport where she disembarked the Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla 2. She returned to Charleston on 16 June and spent all but two days of the next two months in port. On 18 August, Wainwright entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard for her first regular overhaul. On 16 February 1970, the ship returned to operational status. Training off the Florida coast followed by more of the same off the Virginia Capes occupied her until mid-March. After three days in Charleston, Wainwright got underway for gunnery and missile shoots on the Atlantic Fleet weapons range near Puerto Rico. Refresher training out of Guantanamo Bay followed in April, but it was interrupted by two special assignments. On 26 April, she received orders to intercept three Haitian Coast Guard vessels fleeing that country in the wake of an unsuccessful coup. The ship encountered one near the entrance to Guantanamo Bay; but, observing American port officials boarding the ship peacefully, she continued on her way. Later, Wainwright found the other two ships and escorted them back to Guantanamo Bay for temporary asylum. On 10 May, she put to sea to intercept quite a different force -- a Soviet task group. That night, she came upon two of the Russian ships, a guided missile cruiser and a guided missile destroyer. The following day, two submarines, an oiler, and a submarine tender rendezvoused with the first two ships; and all six entered port at Cienfuegos, Cuba, on 14 May. The next day, Wainwright returned to Guantanamo Bay to resume refresher training. Less than a month later, on 12 June, she moored at Charleston for two months of upkeep and training in preparation for her forthcoming deployment to the Far East. On 25 August, the guided missile destroyer stood out of Charleston, bound for her third and final deployment to the western Pacific in conjunction with the Vietnam War. Steaming via the Panama Canal and Pearl Harbor, she arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 21 September. For almost two months, she conducted operations in Japanese waters, primarily bilateral ASW exercises in the Sea of Japan with units of the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force. Periodically, the warship put into Yokosuka and Sasebo for upkeep and liberty. Wainwright departed from Japan on 14 November and headed via the Taiwan Strait for the Tonkin Gulf. On 20 November, she relieved on PIRAZ station and took up familiar duty as the American air coordinator in the northern part of the gulf. That assignment proved very brief for, on the following day, relieved Wainwright; and the guided missile frigate moved on to new duties as the coordinator ship assigned to the north SAR station. For almost a month, she alternated between north and south SAR stations, taking time briefly in mid-December to participate in Operation \\"Beacon Tower\\", a three-day exercise to test the readiness of American warships in the Tonkin Gulf to meet and deal with air and surface attacks. On 16 December, Wainwright left the combat zone, bound for Singapore, where she remained from 19 to 26 December. From there, she set a course for the Philippines and arrived in Subic Bay on 29 December. Wainwright during third Vietnam War deployment. The warship completed six days in port at Subic Bay on 4 January 1971 and got underway for Hong Kong. She returned briefly to Subic Bay, however, for repairs to one of her radar antennae but finally reached Hong Kong on 11 January. Following a four-day visit, she stood out of the British colony on her way to the Tonkin Gulf. She served 16 days in the gulf, dividing her time between PIRAZ duties and assignments as the northern SAR ship. After a final two-day stop at Subic Bay, Wainwright began the long voyage back to Charleston which took her through the Indian Ocean, around the Cape of Good Hope, and across the southern Atlantic to complete her first circumnavigation of the globe. Along the way, she made a series of calls at African and South American ports, beginning with Djibouti in French Somaliland. From there, she headed for Massawa, Ethiopia, where she participated in the celebration of the Ethiopian Navy Day, during which she joined ships of other nations in observing the graduation of midshipmen from the Ethiopian Naval Academy and hosted then-Emperor Haile Selassie I on board. She rounded out her African itinerary with calls at Diego Suarez, Madagascar, and at Louren√ßo Marques, Mozambique, before rounding the cape and heading across the Atlantic toward Brazil. Visits to Rio de Janeiro and Recife in Brazil and at St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands preceded gunfire support training and a missile shoot at Culebra Island. On 2 April, Wainwright steamed into Charleston and began an extended standdown period. Wainwright received four battle stars for service in the Vietnam War.  Post-Vietnam service  Upon completion of a 59-day post-deployment stand-down, Wainwright resumed operations early in June as a unit of the Atlantic Fleet Cruiser-Destroyer Force. She spent much of June in the Caribbean Sea undergoing gunnery and missile training and returned to Charleston on 19 June. Four days later, work began on the installation of a Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS). Those modifications were completed by mid-July, and Wainwright occupied the following four months with operations along the eastern seaboard in conjunction with the initial evaluation of her LAMPS helicopter. A tender availability followed by the conversion of her propulsion plant to burn Navy distillate fuel brought the year to a close at Charleston. The warship completed the conversion on 11 January 1972 and had resumed operations at sea out of Charleston by 24 January. For the next nine months, she tested her new LAMPS installation, made port visits to Atlantic and gulf coast ports, and participated in the usual Second Fleet exercises. Those duties took her from the southeastern coast of Texas to the West Indies and thence as far north as Maine. By late November, she was at Charleston preparing for her first tour of duty in the Mediterranean Sea. On 1 December, Wainwright stood out of Charleston and set a course for Rota, Spain, where she arrived on 10 December. After changing operational control from the Second Fleet to the Sixth Fleet, the guided missile destroyer departed Rota on 11 December and entered the Mediterranean Sea. Conducting ASW and antiair warfare (AAW) exercises, the warship headed across the Mediterranean, stopping at Barcelona from 20 to 26 December and arriving in Naples, Italy, on 30 December. She departed that port on 6 January 1973, and headed for the Ionian Sea. During ASW exercises in Greek waters, Wainwright contacted, tracked, and positively identified four Soviet submarines in spite of their strenuous efforts to evade. Upon completing those exercises, she headed for the southern coast of France, arriving in Marseille on 17 January for a two-day visit. More AAW exercises followed, as did port visits to Palma de Mallorca, M√°laga, and Genoa. On 17 February, she departed Genoa in company with the Italian cruiser Vittorio Veneto to participate in National Week XV, a multinational naval exercise of broad scope conducted across the Central Mediterranean. In addition to the Americans and Italians, units of the Greek and Turkish navies also participated in drills and battle exercises extending westward from Crete to the Strait of Messina between Sicily and the toe of the Italian boot. After National Week XV, Wainwright punctuated a series of Sixth Fleet ASW and AAW exercises with visits to many of the ports already mentioned as well as at Athens, Civitavecchia, Livorno, and Golfe Juan. On 17 June, she steamed from Palma de Mallorca through the Strait of Gibraltar to Rota on the Atlantic coast of Spain. There, she turned her duties over to on 21 June. That same day, she departed Rota for Lisbon, where she joined and in preparation for a transatlantic exercise to test the concept of the sea control ship. The three warships departed Lisbon on 28 June. The exercise lasted from 28 June to 8 July, during which time Wainwright vectored Guam-based Harrier II aircraft to the interception of two Soviet \\"Bear\\" aircraft. Just before the conclusion of the exercise on 8 July, Wainwright ventured across the Arctic Circle briefly before setting a course for Charleston. The guided missile destroyer concluded her first Mediterranean deployment on 20 July and began her standdown period at Charleston. On 10 September, she entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard for her second regular overhaul. Wainwright completed sea trials, the final phase of overhaul, between 10 and 14 June 1974 and officially rejoined the Atlantic Fleet on 20 June at the Charleston Naval Station. For the remainder of the year, the warship was busy with refresher training, a myriad of tests, qualifications, inspections, and evaluations, and other normal Second Fleet operations conducted along the southern Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean. The beginning of 1975 brought another period in drydock, this time at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, for repairs to her sonar dome. She returned to Charleston on 1 February 1975 and resumed tests and inspections in preparation for her second deployment to European waters. On 5 March, she stood down the Cooper River on her way to Europe. En route to the Mediterranean, the guided missile destroyer joined and in a series of ASW, surface, and air action drills, at the conclusion of which Wainwright continued on her way to Spain. She changed operational control to the Sixth Fleet while at Rota between 15 and 17 March. The warship entered the \\"middle sea\\" on the latter date and arrived in Naples, her first Mediterranean port of call, on 22 March. As during her previous Mediterranean cruise, she engaged in one training exercise after another, but interrupted that schedule almost as frequently for port calls all along the Mediterranean coast of Europe. Late in April, a missile- firing exercise was interrupted by a snoopy Soviet destroyer and had to be postponed until the following day. June proved to be an important month in Wainwright's history, for it was during the latter part of that month that she transited the Straits of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles into the Black Sea and became the first American ship to visit Romania, at the port city of Constan≈£a, in 49 years. After concluding that visit on 24 June and passing back into the Mediterranean on 25 June, she conducted a brief surveillance of the Soviet helicopter carrier Leningrad before resuming her schedule of training exercises and port visits. On 30 June, Wainwright was redesignated a guided missile cruiser, CG-28. Her second tour of duty with the Sixth Fleet lasted until late August. On 22 August, she made a one-day stop at Rota; then headed home. Nine days later, she moored at Charleston and, for the remainder of the year, resumed a routine of Second Fleet operations, inspections, and upkeep. Following a spring of special operations and underway training out of Charleston, Wainwright got underway on 30 June for New York City and her big events for 1976: the International Naval Review and Operation \\"Sail\\", both in honor of the United States' Bicentennial birthday. To the guided missile cruiser went the signal honor of being the focal point of both events, serving as flagship for the naval review and as reviewing ship for Operation \\"Sail.\\" During her service in those two capacities, she entertained Vice President of the United States Nelson D. Rockefeller, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Admiral James L. Holloway III, Chief of Naval Operations, and Admiral Shanahan, Commander, Second Fleet. On 6 July, the ship departed New York and headed back to Charleston to resume her more mundane schedule of special operations and training cruises. That routine, spiced liberally with tests, inspections, evaluations, and certifications. saw her through the Bicentennial year and the first three months of 1977. On 31 March 1977, Wainwright embarked upon her third deployment to the Mediterranean. She joined the Sixth Fleet officially upon arrival in Rota on 12 April and actually entered the Mediterranean the following day. Port visits and an almost incessant schedule of training exercises -- ASW drills, AAW practice, missile shoots, multinational and bilateral exercises -- occupied her once again. During June, she visited the Black Sea once more, but otherwise, her routine was similar to that she had experienced in previous tours of duty with the Sixth Fleet. She concluded her Mediterranean operations at Rota at the end of the first week in October and arrived back in Charleston on 21 October. For the remaining two months of 1977, typical Second Fleet operations out of Charleston filled her schedule. January 1978 was spent in grooming for a multi-threat training exercise, \\"READEX 1-78\\", which took place in February in the southern Florida and Caribbean operating areas. Returning to Charleston late in the month, Wainwright entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard on 23 February for the commencement of a scheduled 13-month overhaul which concluded in March 1979.  Operation Praying Mantis  On 18 April 1988, Wainwright participated in Operation Praying Mantis. Operation Praying Mantis was the 18 April 1988 action waged by U.S. naval forces in retaliation for the Iranian mining of an American warship. The 14 April mining nearly sank the guided missile frigate , which was sailing in the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Earnest Will, the 1987-88 convoy missions in which U.S. warships escorted reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers to protect them from Iranian attacks. After the mining, U.S. Navy divers recovered other mines in the area. The serial numbers matched those of mines seized along with the Iran Ajr the previous September. By the time Roberts was towed to Dubai on 15 April, battered but saved with no loss of life, U.S. planning for the retaliatory operation had already begun in Washington and in the Middle East. The battle, the largest for American surface forces since World War II, sank two Iranian warships and as many as six armed speedboats. It also marked the first surface-to-surface missile engagement in U.S. Navy history. The attack by the U.S. helped pressure Iran to agree to a ceasefire with Iraq later that summer, ending the eight-year conflict between the Persian Gulf neighbors. On 18 April 1988, the Americans responded with several groups of surface warships, plus airplanes from the carrier . The action began with coordinated strikes by two surface groups. One group, consisting of two destroyers and the amphibious transport dock , attacked the Sassan oil platform while the other, which included the guided missile cruiser, Wainwright and two frigates, attacked the Sirri oil platform. U.S. Marines from Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) 2-88 fast-roped onto the Sassan platform, gathered intelligence, and set explosives to disable it. Iran responded by dispatching Boghammar speedboats to attack various targets in the Persian Gulf, including an American-flagged supply ship and a Panamanian-flagged ship. After these attacks, A-6E Intruder aircraft from VA-95 were vectored in on the speedboats by an American frigate. The two aircraft, dropped Rockeye II cluster bombs on the speedboats, sinking one and damaging several others. Action continued to escalate. Joshan, an Iranian La Combattante II Kaman-class fast attack craft, challenged Wainwright and her surface group, firing a Harpoon missile at Wainwright. Wainwright responded to the challenge by firing four Standard missiles. After damage assessment of Joshan, fired one Harpoon missile at Joshan; however, Joshans superstructure had been destroyed by the previous attacks, so the missile did not strike the target. The three ships of Surface Action Group Charlie closed on Joshan, destroying it with naval gunfire. Fighting continued when the Iranian frigate Sahand departed Bandar Abbas and challenged elements of an American surface group. She was observed by two VA-95 A-6Es while they were flying surface combat air patrol for . Sahand launched missiles at the A-6Es, and the Intruders replied with launches of two Harpoons and four laser-guided Skipper bombs. This was followed by a Harpoon firing from Joseph Strauss. The weapons delivered against Sahand were successful. By the end of the operation, elements of the American fleet had damaged Iranian naval and intelligence facilities on two inoperable oil platforms in the Persian Gulf and sunk at least six armed Iranian speedboats. Sahand was repaired in 1989 and has since been upgraded and is still in service with the Iranian navy. In short, Iran lost one major warship and a smaller gunboat. Damage to the infrastructure of the two oil platforms forced their demolition after the war. The site was built up again for oil production by French and Russian oil companies, after buying the drilling rights from the Iranian government. The U.S. side took two casualties: the aircrew of a Marine Corps AH-1T Sea Cobra gunship. The Cobra, attached to USS Trenton, was flying reconnaissance from Wainwright and crashed sometime after dark about southwest of Abu Musa island. Two bodies were recovered by Navy divers in May, and the wreckage of the helicopter was raised later that month. Navy officials said it showed no sign of battle damage, though the aircraft could have crashed while trying to evade Iranian fire. The guided missile cruiser was called to protect the extraction of Roberts and arrived a month later. The heightened tensions contributed to the crew of Vincennes mistakenly shooting down a commercial airliner on a routine flight, Iran Air Flight 655, killing all 290 crew and passengers on 3 July, less than 2 months after their arrival. Operation Praying Mantis is one of five American naval engagements cited by United States Naval Academy Prof. Craig L. Symonds in his book Decision at Sea (2005) as being decisive in establishing U.S. naval superiority. The others were the Battle of Lake Erie (1813), the Battle of Hampton Roads (1862), the Battle of Manila Bay (1898), and the Battle of Midway (1942). On 6 November 2003, the International Court of Justice dismissed Iran's claim for reparation against the United States for breach of the 1955 Treaty of Amity between the two countries. The court also dismissed a counter-claim by the United States, also for reparation for breach of the same treaty. As part of its finding the court did note that \\"the actions of the United States of America against Iranian oil platforms on 19 October 1987 (Operation Nimble Archer) and 18 April 1988 (Operation Praying Mantis) cannot be justified as measures necessary to protect the essential security interests of the United States of America.\\" The Court also ruled that it, \\"...cannot however uphold the submission of the Islamic Republic of Iran that those actions constitute a breach of the obligations of the United States of America under Article X, paragraph 1, of that Treaty, regarding freedom of commerce between the territories of the parties, and that, accordingly, the claim of the Islamic Republic of Iran for reparation also cannot be upheld;\\"  Fate  Wainwright decommissioned on 15 November 1993 and was mothballed for most of a decade. On 11 June 2002, ex-Wainwright was used as a live fire target and struck by two Harpoon missiles from . Remaining afloat overnight, she was attacked the next day by the Royal Navy attack submarine , which hit Wainright with a Spearfish torpedo, severing the bow. US aircraft then attacked Wainwright, before she was scuttled with explosive charges.http://www.navynews.co.uk/articles/2002/0207/0002073001.asp  References  Category:Belknap-class cruisers Category:Ships built in Bath, Maine Category:1965 ships Category:Cold War cruisers of the United States Category:Ships sunk as targets ","title":"USS Wainwright (CG-28)"},{"id":"7063146","text":"Ambt Almelo is a former municipality in the Dutch province of Overijssel.

It was one of the first arcade games to feature a skateboard controller interface.Mark J. P. Wolf (2008), The video game explosion: a history from PONG to Playstation and beyond, p. xx, ABC-CLIO, In Top Skater, players stand on a skateboard-like platform which swung side-to-side or tilted, manipulating the actions of the avatars in the game. The game has ramps, rails and other skating objects from which the player can do tricks to gain points. The player has a limited amount of time in which to perform tricks, but can extend this time by collecting time bonus rings or by performing certain tricks. The game's style is like that of the later Sega game Crazy Taxi, noticeably the character art design and music type. Top Skater was also directed by Kenji Kanno. A sequel called Air Trix was released in 2001. Development The AM3 team wanted to make Top Skater a game which would allow players to explore unrealistically large skateboarding courses and perform the fantasy tricks associated with skateboarding's image, rather than a realistic simulation. Because of this, recreating some of the tricks for motion capture would require an unusually large studio with equipment to propel the motion capture actor through the air, so all the animation was done by hand. The primary target audience for the game was young Americans. None of the development team members skateboarded; instead, they watched professional skateboarders both live and on video for research. An AM3 member explained the game's trick-based approach: \\"It wouldn't make any sense to make a skateboard racing game. You don't need to skateboard as fast as you can. I just wanted to make the game cool and fashionable. If the game were a racing game you wouldn't want to do any tricks as you'd be absorbed in trying to race as fast as possible.\\" The team collaborated with Sega AM4 in designing the skateboard interface and cabinet. They installed an MPEG board for the sound, since using MPEG boards had recently become more financially feasible. The game debuted at Sega's GameWorks venue in Seattle. The main sponsor of the game was Coca-Cola. Soundtrack The soundtrack of the game consisted entirely of these songs by the punk rock band Pennywise: * \\"Society\\" (from the then-released Full Circle) * \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" (from Pennywise) * \\"Homesick\\" (from Unknown Road) * \\"It's What You Do With It\\" (from About Time) * \\"Dying To Know\\" (from Unknown Road) * \\"Searching\\" (from About Time) * \\"The Secret\\" (from Pennywise) * \\"Try To Conform\\" (from Unknown Road) * \\"Peaceful Day\\" (from About Time) * \\"Perfect People\\" (from About Time) The developers selected Pennywise because they felt punk rock was both the most appropriate genre for the skateboarding theme and the best choice to excite players, and some members of the team were fans of the group.

After the death of Arduino, marquis of Ivrea and the first to bear the title of king of Italy (1015), the Counts of Canavese part of the House of Ivrea (who all claimed to be his descendants) shared out the region. This was the beginning of the big families of Canavese: San Martino, Valperga, de Candia, Castellamonte, and later the Biandrate family from Novara. The House of Savoy started its political expansion in Canavese in the 14th century, and the Commune of Ivrea as well as the Canavese Counts became their subjects. In the 16th century, Canavese came under French domination, then Spanish domination, then back to French domination. Napoleon's defeat in 1814 returned Canavese under the House of Savoy.

The obverse side normally features an image of the subject with identifying information such as name and team. The reverse can feature statistics, biographical information, or as many early cards did, advertising. There is no fixed size or shape of hockey cards, running the gamut from rectangular to circular, however modern North American cards have typically standardized on a 2.5 by 3.5 inch (6.35 cm by 8.89 cm) rectangular format. History The first hockey cards were included in cigarette packages from 1910 to 1913, manufactured by Imperial Tobacco Canada for the inaugural NHL season. The 1910 set had a total of 36 cards, each one featuring an illustration of a player.History of Hockey Cards on Starr Cards website After World War I, only one more cigarette set was issued, during the 1924-25 season by Champ's Cigarettes. NHL player Billy Coutu's biography includes an example of one of the 40 cards issued at that time. During the 1920s, some hockey cards were printed by food and candy companies, such as Paulin's Candy, Maple Crispette, Crescent, Holland Creameries and La Patrie. Through to 1941, O-Pee-Chee printed hockey cards, stopping production for World War II. Presumably, the 1941 involvement of the US in the war affected the hockey card market, since Canada had been in the war since 1939. Hockey cards next appeared during 1951-52, issued by Toronto's Parkhurst Products. Brooklyn's Topps Chewing Gum began printing hockey cards in 1954-1955. Parkhurst and Topps did not produce cards for the 1955-56 season but returned for 1957-58. In the 1960s, some hockey card and hockey coin sets were issued by food companies, including Shirriff Desserts, Salada Tea and York Peanut Butter. Other companies to manufacture hockey cards include Pinnacle, Pacific, Pro Set, Upper Deck, In The Game, Panini, Score, and various early 1990s manufacturers (7th Inning Sketch, Classic, etc.). Esso briefly issued stamp- sized hockey cards on soft paper in the early 1970s in return for gas purchases. Post lockout hockey cards (2005-present) After the National Hockey League lockout that wiped out the 2004-05 NHL season, the hockey card market changed dramatically. Prior to the lockout, Upper Deck, Pacific, Topps and In The Game Trading Cards were all licensed by the NHL and NHLPA to produce trading cards featuring NHL players and logos. After the lockout, Upper Deck emerged with an exclusive contract from both parties. Upper Deck paid $25 million over 5 years for this deal with the PA. Without licensing, Topps simply did not produce hockey cards. Pacific went out of business, its last set was produced just prior to the NHL lockout. In The Game continued to produce hockey cards without NHL and NHLPA licensing. They signed current and retired NHL players to individual contracts, allowing the use of their likenesses and autographs. In The Game also signed licensing deals with the CHL, the AHL and Hockey Canada to use players and logos from these organizations in their products. Prior to the 2010-11 NHL season, Upper Deck renewed its license and the NHL and PA awarded Panini with a license. Following the 2013-14 NHL season, Upper Deck gained exclusive rights, and Panini lost its license.

After Gram Parsons' death in 1973, posthumous interest in the Burrito Brothers' music grew. This interest caused the band's original label, A&M; Records, to release the compilation album Close Up the Honky-Tonks in 1974. Since Rick Roberts had dissolved the Flying Burrito Brothers after a brief 1973 European tour with no original members, former manager Eddie Tickner started to think about the possibilities of reviving the band. After Tickner received booking interest from a number of clubs, founding members \\"Sneaky\\" Pete Kleinow and Chris Ethridge agreed to re- form the Burritos. They hired former Byrds drummer Gene Parsons, guitarist Joel Scott Hill from Canned Heat, and fiddler Gib Guilbeau to round out the \\"refried\\" Burritos. Tickner then got the new band a deal with Columbia Records, of which Flying Again was their label debut. Despite having two original members, the sound of this album is markedly different from the albums released by the original incarnation. The best examples of this are on the tracks \\"Dim Lights, Thick Smoke (And Loud, Loud Music)\\" and \\"Hot Burrito #3\\". \\"Dim Lights\\" is much faster and more rocking than the version recorded by the original lineup that would appear in 1976. While bassist Chris Ethridge had a significant hand in the writing of \\"Hot Burrito #1\\" and #2, #3 is a jarring departure from the style of the first two songs. The lyrics are written more as a caricature of the first two. Joel Scott Hill handled lead vocals on most of the tracks, with Gib Guilbeau on three (Including a sprightly version of \\"Why Baby Why\\") and Gene Parsons on one. \\"Building Fires\\" was released as a single.

He was the eldest child of Nicholas Porter Earp and Abigail Storm. He was the half-brother of Old West lawmen Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan Earp. He was in the Union army during the Civil War, serving as a part of the 4th Iowa Cavalry, and eventually mustered out with the rank of corporal. Departing the army in 1865 he went to Missouri to farm on the land of his father near Lamar, then lost an election for constable five years later at Lamar. In 1871 he moved to Kansas, near the town of Stearling, Rice County where he was a farmer and pioneer settler, and thence to Garden City, in which town he rose quickly, becoming marshal for some time. He was said to have hunted buffalo in 1873 near Peace, Kansas. He had also migrated to Wyoming and Nevada, probably settling in the towns of Casper and Paradise before moving to California. Newton was a Mason and died in 1928. Early life and Civil War service Newton was born in Ohio County, Kentucky, to Nicholas Earp and his first wife, Abigail Storm. His mother died when he was two. Newton Earp, and half-brothers James and Virgil, were close for their entire lives. He married Jennie (last name unknown) in 1854. She died before 1887. He ran against his younger half-brother Wyatt for the office of constable. The Earps may have hoped to keep the job in the family one way or another. Wyatt won by 137 votes to Newton's 108, but their father Nicholas lost the election for justice of the peace in a very close four-way race. Following the outbreak of the Civil War, Earp enlisted in the Union Army (along with both James and Virgil) on November 11, 1861. Earp served with Company F of the Fourth Cavalry, Iowa Volunteers. He was promoted to fourth sergeant on January 1, 1865. His brother James was badly wounded in a battle near Fredericktown, Missouri, and returned home only months after his enlistment. Virgil and Newton, however, served the entire war. Newton mustered out of the Army on June 26, 1865, in Louisville, Kentucky. Newton Earp card; Original Document; Civil War Pension Index Card;Newton Earp ; picture archival webpage; Eagle Free Enterprises; accessed May 2017. Post-Civil War After Earp's return from the American Civil War, he married Nancy Jane Adam in Marion County, Missouri on 12 Sep 1865. The newlyweds then joined his father and siblings in San Bernardino, California in southern California, where most of the family had relocated. There, Newton worked as a saloon manager. Earp and family returned to the Midwest in 1868, first settling in Lamar, Missouri, where Earp took up farming. The family later relocated to Kansas. The Earps had five children: Effie May, Wyatt Clyde, Mary Elizabeth, Alice Abigail, and Virgil Edwin. They named their first-born son (born on August 25, 1872) after his not-yet-famous younger brother, Wyatt; and their second son (born April 19, 1880) after his younger brother, Virgil. Later life and death Following another relocation to California, Newton became a carpenter, building homes in northern California and northwestern Nevada. Daughter Effie May and wife Jennie both died on March 29, 1898 in Paradise Hill, Nevada, also known as Paradise Valley. Newton died at age 91 in Sacramento, California on December 18, 1928. Only his brother Wyatt survived him, with Wyatt dying almost a month later on January 13, 1929. He is buried in Sacramento's East Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.

Rautaruukki steel factory in Raahe Jul2009 001 Four employees of Ruukki before the rolling mill in H√§meenlinna The company was founded in 1960 by the Finnish Government to provide the steel supply needed by the nation's heavy industries. Since part-privatization in 1994, the state has gradually decreased its holding in Rautaruukki to 40% and the firm is now a constituent member of the OMX Helsinki 25 index . The name of the corporation means simply ironworks in Finnish. The firm consists of three business areas: construction, engineering and metals. Rautaruukki produces a range of products for clients in various industries, including cabins and chassis for heavy vehicles, hot rolled steel plates and coils, roofing sheets and building and bridge structures. The company employs around 11,800 people, e.g. in the Nordic countries, the Baltics, China, Russia, Ukraine and Central Eastern Europe. History 1960s Rautaruukki was founded by the Finnish government in 1960. Also Outokumpu, Valmet, W√§rtsil√§, Rauma-Repola and Fiskars were involved in the company's birth. The main purpose for the new company was to guarantee the availability of raw materials for the Finnish metal industry, e.g. ship building. Rautaruukki's steel mill in Raahe did not use the traditional ingot casting method which was still used in other western countries but produced steel with the cost-efficient continuous casting technique. The company grew from six people employed in 1960 to more than 1,700 by the end of the 1960s. 1970s In the 1970s Rautaruukki portfolio expanded to sheets and pipe products because it wanted to reach a wider range of customers. A cold rolling mill was established in H√§meenlinna where tube production was started. A second blast furnace was also opened in 1976 in Raahe. In the end of the decade Rautaruukki had over 7,000 employees. 1980s Rautaruukki began to grow in Western Europe by establishing sales offices and making acquisitions. It bought a colour-coating works called Metalcolour A/S from Denmark, a steel wholesale business called CCB-Gruppen from Norway and a tube mill called Schmacke Rohr GmbH from Germany. In 1989 Stelform A/S (a new cold-formed section production plant) was established in Denmark. In the end of 1980's Rautaruukki employed almost 10,000 people. In 1989 Rautaruukki became a publicly traded company. 1990s In the 1990s Rautaruukki invested to increase the degree of production's upgrading. It also entered the construction business by acquiring Finnish steel roof manufacturer called Rannila. The markets in Eastern Europe were opened first in the Baltics and Poland, followed by Russia, Ukraine, the Czech Republic and Hungary. In the end of the decade, Rautaruukki had 5,000 employees outside Finland, employing all together over 12,000 persons. 2000s When Sakari Tamminen started as a new CEO in January 2004 he began a wide renewal program. All the companies in Rautaruukki Corporation began using Ruukki as their marketing name. According to the new strategy Ruukki began to focus on special steel products and on the solutions businesses in the construction and engineering industries. Ruukki executed demanding construction and engineering projects around the world. The acquisitions in the 2000s included Velsa (2004), Metalplast and Syneco Industri AB (2005) and PPTH, OOO Ventall, Omeo, AZST- Kolor and Steel-Mont in 2006. Ruukki started in China in 2005. It opened the first sales office in Shanghai in 2009, now there is office also in Beijing. 2010s In May 2011 Ruukki corporation's organization was renewed, it now has three divisions: Ruukki Construction, Ruukki Engineering and Ruukki Metals. In 2011 Ruukki introduced new product, an energy panel which helps to improve the energy rating of buildings and opened a sales office in Mumbai. In 2014 Swedish steelmaker SSAB has agreed to buy Finland's Rautaruukki Corp. The deal has not yet (April 2014) been approved by the anti-trust authorities. Organization Ruukki has three business areas: Ruukki Construction, Ruukki Engineering and Ruukki Metals. Ruukki Construction Ruukki Construction¬¥s solutions are for lifecycle and energy-efficient steel structure in the construction industry. Ruukki Construction's products are used in commercial, office and industrial construction, as well as in the construction of single- family houses, ports, wind turbines and infrastructure construction. Investments Ruukki has made in Russia has delivered results for Ruukki is now the largest steel constructor on the Russian market west of the Urals. In May 2011 Ruukki stated it was the first manufacturer which had developed a solar panel facade converting the sun's rays to electricity. The photovoltaic system is fully integrated into a facade and the electricity produced can be used either to serve the needs of the building itself or it can be fed into the public grid. A solar panel facade of an average office can produce 18,000 kWh of electricity yearly. Ruukki Construction's products can be found for example in the following buildings: * Alma Media's new office building was to be opened by the end of 2012. It has a steel frame supplied by Rautaruukki. * A mail terminal at Hallsberg, √ñrebro County, Sweden, has steel frame, facade and roof structures from Ruukki. Ruukki Engineering Ruukki Engineering focuses on providing fully assembled systems and components for the engineering industry. The unit's products include: *cabins for mobile machines, *special-steel components (such as booms, masts, frames and support legs), *components for the lifting, handling and transportation industry, *wind turbine components, *oil sumps *base frames for generators and *engines. Ruukki Metals In 2011 the Ruukki Metals business unit employed around 5.400 people and had net sales of ‚Ç¨1.691 million and operating profit of ‚Ç¨80 million which makes it the largest business area of Ruukki. In autumn 2011 Ruukki introduced Flex service concept. Instead of standard sizes customers can get exactly the size of stainless steel and aluminium they need which helps to reduce the customer's waste material and energy costs. Ruukki Metals' special steel products include *high-strength, wear-resistant and specially coated products, *wear-resistant Raex and *ultra-high-strength Optim structural steel. Raex is used in ships, concrete mixers, crushers, screening equipment, excavator buckets and demolition equipment. The advantage of Raex is in its lightness: a steel container made of Raex is 40% lighter than a container made of regular steel so it is easier to handle and cheaper to transport. Optim is used in aerial and various transportation tanks and containers. Optim weighs also less than regular steel. Ruukki Metal's other products are rolled steel products, metal and colour-coated steels, tubes, bars, beams, stainless steels and aluminium and mineral products which comes as a by-product of the steel-making process. The unit also provides product- related services including prefabrication, parts processing, logistics and storage. According to the company's strategy, it is not worth shipping mild steel far by world standards, but it does pay to ship spearhead products to the other side of the world for example. Recognitions *The 2011 Steel Construction of the Year award was given to Kilden Performing Arts Centre in Kristiansand, Norway by The Finnish Constructional Steelwork Association. Ruukki Construction delivered the frame and was responsible for the detail design, fabrication and installation of the steel structures for the centre. The construction of Kilden showed an innovative combination of different materials: steel, wood and stone. *Ruukki has received awards for promoting sustainability: **in autumn 2011 Ruukki achieved the position of industry leader in two Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes **in October 2011, Ruukki got Worldsteel's prize for sustainability reporting.

Kassel: AGON Sportverlag SVB was one of the founding members of the German Football Association (Deutscher Fussball Bund or German Football Association) established in Leipzig in 1900. History A split of the association led to the formation of Sport Club Schlesien Breslau on 26 August 1901. SC captured local titles in the Verband Breslauer Ballspiel-Vereine (VBBB) over four consecutive seasons from 1904 to 1907 leading to participation in regional level competition and championships in the S√ºdostdeutscher Fussball Verband in 1906 and 1907. Subsequent appearances in the national level playoffs ended with quarter final losses. What remained of parent club SV Blitz Breslau adopted the name Verein f√ºr Rasenspiel 1897 Breslau on 2 May 1907 and then went on to enjoy their own successes. They followed SC as three time VBBB champions from 1908 to 1910 and as S√ºdostdeutscher titlists in 1908 and 1910. VfR also went out in the quarter finals in their two national level appearances. Several members of SC left the club in 1919 to create a football department within Turnverein Vorw√§rts Breslau. This club later merged with 1911 Krietern to form FV Rapide Breslau and earned a semi-final appearance in SOFV play in 1921. SC and Rapid were united in 1924 to form Schlesien 01 Rapid Breslau. By 1925 this club was again playing simply as SC Schlesien Breslau. In 1934 these threads were all brought together when VfR and SC were re-united as VfR Schlesien 1897 Breslau.

Barbadoes Island, encompassing about 90 acres, was part of the original land grants made to William Penn. In the 1700s, the University of Pennsylvania acquired title to Barbadoes Island. The name of Barbadoes Island may reflect a trade relationship between Philadelphia and Barbados, an island in the West Indies that was also under British control at one time. Wealthy planters from the Caribbean-isle sent their children to Philadelphia to be educated. In the early 1800s John Markley purchased Barbadoes Island, where he farmed the land and built a farm house. Between 1840 and 1910, pleasure steamboats carried excursionists to the island and up to Phoenixville from a wharf in Norristown. The island was purchased in 1922 by Counties Gas and Electric Company, which later merged with Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO). A power plant was constructed on the island in 1926. Power plants fueled by gas, coal and oil occupied the island in post-World War II era until recently. The plant was originally coal-powered, then converted to diesel power in the 1970s. It was operated by the Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO/Exelon) until 1997. The PECO facility was most recently used for equipment storage, company training and as an electrical substation.

Although this is the second episode overall in the series, it is listed as the third episode on the first season DVD release, while \\"Queens for a Day\\" was listed as episode 2. The episode's title is a reference to the music box that Bradford took from Fey's apartment, and Betty's pink bunny that Amanda kidnaps and abuses. It is also the first episode to be produced in Los Angeles. Plot As Betty begins her first day at MODE as Daniel's assistant, she is given the ins and outs on what to expect now that she and Daniel have become a team. Things start when Bradford tells Daniel that as the editor-in-chief he should take charge of the 'book' - the mock-up of the upcoming issue before it hits the stands. Daniel decides to let Betty in on how the setup is prepared by taking her to the meeting. Here he tells the staff, including Wilhelmina, that he will review the issue personally and orders that he be given the 'book'. This issue will feature digitalized photos of movie star Natalie Whitman, who is none too happy with how they will alter them because she has gained weight, although Betty admires her just as she looks. While running an errand for Daniel, including a stop for lunch in the cafeteria where she shows off her homemade empanadas and talk about the mock-up with the \\"Uglies\\" (to which Zelda mentions to Christina that she would be great on the cover of National Geographic after she brings up about if she was on the cover), Betty notices her pink bunny is missing from her desk. This sets up a recurring theme in this episode, with Betty receiving several e-mails with pictures of the bunny being battered, and Amanda taunting Betty. Just as Daniel is giving the mock- up the once-over, Amanda distracts him with tickets to an opera (that she says is as boring as heck, but there is a room upstairs where they can 'do naughty things' and not get caught), so he agrees to go with her and leaves the 'book' in the office. After Daniel leaves for the evening, Betty goes into the office and takes it upon herself to take the 'book' home. At home Betty shows the issue to her family, but is distracted by Gina, who is furious with Betty over destroying her TV (see previous episode) and now wants $4,000. We also learn that there is bad blood between Gina and Hilda. When Hilda grabs the 'book' and threatens to hit Gina, Gina notices the 'book' (or as she calls it, \\"The Dead Sea Scrolls\\") and sees a way to get her money. That night, by using her 'juvie' skills, she sneaks in and takes the 'book'. The following day Betty receives a ransom note under the door saying that she'll get the book back if Gina gets her $4,000. At Gina's place, Gina and Hilda (who sneaked in through the back door) resume their catfight, resulting in Gina's hairpiece being ripped off. Hilda sarcastically says that now she and Betty owe Gina $4,000... and fifty cents. Daniel calls, and at first Betty decides to cover her tracks by lying to him but when she comes clean he decides to help Betty by paying Gina to get the issue back. Unfortunately Wilhelmina gets wind of this (via a text message from the chauffeur who picked Betty up) and sends Marc to retrieve it. When Betty and Daniel (who stalls a staff meeting so he has time to recover the mock-up) arrive to get the 'book', Gina tells them that she got a LCD TV after someone else showed up to claim it. While there, Betty sees Walter fixing Gina's set but he insists that he still has feelings for Betty. When Walter turns the TV on, they learn that a story involving the missing 'book' has found its way onto the TV channel Fashion TV. After telling the truth to Bradford about what has happened, Betty is left with no choice but to quit (good news for Amanda). Then Natalie shows up and says that she wants the real photos of herself to be published in MODE and that Betty should keep her job (another setback for Amanda). As expected Daniel upstages Wilhelmina by having Natalie appear on Fashion TV, where she explains why she wants the public to see her just the way she really looks. After taking the mock-up off Wilhelmina's hands, Daniel has just enough time to look properly through it before it is published. Meanwhile, Bradford decides to take a personal interest in the Fey Sommers scandal (Bradford and Fey dating) by telling the private detective he plans to sneak into Fey's apartment to see what he can find. In the process Bradford finds a photo of himself and Fey together, along with a music box, which he takes with him. Bradford destroys the photo by burning it, casting suspicion about his own involvement with Sommers. As for Wilhelmina, she once again visits the mystery woman to see if she can get more info on how to take down the Meades in her plot to take over the company. As Daniel goes over the mock-up, a woman phones to tell him that he should be proud of his father.... and warns him that he should be careful when he is around him... then hangs up. Other notes In the episode Bradford is reading the German newspaper \\"Berliner Zeitung\\" (actually the July 21, 2006 edition of the more distinguished \\"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\\" with a fake \\"Berliner Zeitung\\"-head) while talking to his private investigator, Steve, in the park. When Steve asks why he is reading the paper knowing that he doesn't speak German, Bradford replies that he doesn't need to...he owns the newspaper! This seems to be a reference to the German telenovela \\"Verliebt in Berlin\\", which is also based on \\"Yo soy Betty la fea\\". Germany's Sat. 1, which aired \\"Verliebt\\", started broadcasting \\"Betty\\" in that country in April 2007, but would cancel the show after two weeks because of low ratings, making it the only country to cancel the series. But in May 2010, sixx, a digital cable network for women owned by ProSiebenSat.1 began airing Ugly Betty under its original title. Sat.1 also gave Ugly Betty another chance as well with airing the show on Sunday afternoons starting August 8, 2010. In contrast to its premiere title which was Alles Betty (Everything Betty), the series was renamed Betty ‚Äì Allein unter Models (Betty ‚Äì Alone among models) when it aired on Sat.1 In one scene Justin, mentions The Devil Wears Prada, after he claims to have seen the movie seven times. The mentioning of \\"Prada\\" would be referenced later on in several episodes during the first season. There has been a lot of debate over the comparisons over \\"Ugly Betty\\" and \\"Prada\\" ever since.From USA Today (September 25, 2006) Ratings The episode would pull in 14.2 million viewers (down from 16.1 million for the first episode) in the United States, making it the second most watched episode in the seriesFrom TV Guide (October 6, 2007) References Also starring *Kevin Sussman - Walter *Ava Gaudet - Gina Gambarro *Stelio Savante - Steve *Elizabeth Payne - Masked Woman *Cicily Daniels - Zelda Guest stars *Sarah Jones - Natalie Whitman *Jack Plotnick - Natalie's Publicist *Lucy Davis - Fashion TV Host *Corinne Dekker - Nancy *Jeff Ellingson - Jeff *Michael Edward Rose - Edgar *Scottie Thompson - Photo Editor Category:Ugly Betty (season 1) episodes Category:2006 American television episodes ","title":"The Box and the Bunny"},{"id":"7063485","text":"IAR Systems is a Swedish computer software company that offers development tools for embedded systems.

In the early industrial revolution, the Mander family entered the vanguard of the expansion of Wolverhampton, on the edge of the largest manufacturing conurbation in the British Isles. Mander Brothers was a major employer in the city of Wolverhampton, a progressive company which became the Number One manufacturers of varnish, paint and later printing ink in the British Empire. The family became distinguished for public service, art patronage and philanthropy. Charles Tertius Mander (1852‚Äì1929) was created the first baronet of The Mount in the baronetage of the United Kingdom in the Coronation honours of George V, on 8 July 1911. Early history The family were yeoman farmers, settled since about 1291 at Tredington on the Warwickshire/Worcestershire borders of Midland England. The Wolverhampton family descends from Henry Mander (1601‚Äì72), of Aston Cantlow, whose son, Samuel Mander, migrated about 1695 to Lapworth Hall (also known as 'Irelands'], where the family remained for about 200 years. In 1742, his grandson Thomas Mander (1720‚Äì1764), a younger son, migrated a few miles north to Wolverhampton, then a market town of just 7,500 people. There he settled as a merchant, maltster and manufacturer, and in due course inherited property from the family of his wife, Elizabeth Clemson, in John Street, which today forms the core of the modern city. Family members *Benjamin (1752‚Äì1819) and John Mander (1754‚Äì1827) were Thomas's sons. By 1773, they were setting up a cluster of loosely integrated businesses in Wolverhampton, including one of the largest chemical manufacturing works in the country, together with businesses in baking, japanning and tin-plate working, canals and gas manufacture. Benjamin Mander was chairman of the Wolverhampton Union Flour and Bread Company, a milling co-operative company set up for charitable purposes to provide subsidised bread and flour in the period of social distress following the Napoleonic Wars. The two brothers campaigned actively against the slave trade, founded chapels, libraries and schools, and entered into local politics as town commissioners, four Manders sitting at one time for the Georgian borough. Hereafter, the eldest sons of the senior line of the family have been given the first name Charles: *Charles Mander (1780‚Äì1853), the eldest son of Benjamin, founded a varnish works in 1803 which was to prosper though the 19th century. He was a penal reformer who campaigned against the Blood Money Act, successfully petitioning with others for its repeal in 1818. The romantic story of how he rescued two soldiers from the gallows accused of stealing just 1s.1d. became the subject of a novel by the jurist Samuel Warren, Now and Then (1848). He was a noted nonconformist, whose exertions for the tenure of endowments by a 23-year Chancery case led to the Dissenters' Chapels Act 1844. *Charles Benjamin Mander JP (1819‚Äì1878) was the eldest son of Charles. He established the first publicly funded institution for art education in Britain in 1852. As a town councillor, he campaigned for clean drinking water fountains, and for the free library in Wolverhampton. With the rise of the railways, he greatly expanded the business of Mander Brothers, forming a partnership with his brother Samuel in 1845. *Sir Charles Tertius Mander JP, DL (1852‚Äì1929), the eldest son of Benjamin, among many public offices was uniquely four times mayor of Wolverhampton 1892-6, an alderman, was awarded an honorary freedom of the borough; he was a colonel in the Staffordshire Yeomanry, and the first of the family to serve as High Sheriff of Staffordshire. He was a progressive industrialist and manufacturer as the first chairman of Mander Brothers (1923), the family paint and varnish works, but also in many other companies, including a Midland electrical company credited with the invention of the spark plug. He was created the first baronet of the Mount, Tettenhall Wood, for his public services on 8 July 1911. *Sir Charles Arthur Mander JP, DL, TD (1884‚Äì1951), the second baronet, was the elder son of Charles Tertius by Mary Le Mesurier, daughter of Henry Nicholas Paint, a Member of the Dominion Parliament of Canada. He was twice mayor of Wolverhampton, and an honorary freeman of the borough. He shot (rifle) for England while at Trinity College, Cambridge. In World War I he was a major in the Staffordshire Yeomanry, attached to the Yeomanry Mounted Division in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. He was wounded in the Third Battle of Gaza at Beersheba in 1917, and following the decisive battle of Megiddo entered Damascus in triumph with General Allenby. He served on over 65 committees and organisations at one time, was in demand as a public speaker, and presented early radio discussion programmes. He was Vice-Chairman of the National Savings Committee and President of Rotary International for Britain and Ireland. In the USA, he was made an honorary chief Red Crow of the Blackfoot tribe in Montana when he gave the address at the dedication of the Waterton- Glacier International Peace Park, the first national park to be so dedicated, in 1932. *Sir Charles Marcus Mander (1921‚Äì2006), the third baronet, was the only son of Charles Arthur by Monica Neame, of Kent. He fought with the Coldstream Guards in World War II in North Africa, Germany and Italy, where following the Salerno landings he was gravely wounded in the fierce fighting at Calabritto, on the slopes of Monte Camino, in October 1943. He was a director of Mander Brothers, responsible for its property portfolio, and redeveloped the centre of Wolverhampton, from 1968 establishing the Mander Shopping Centre and Mander Square on the site of the early family works. Sir Charles was High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1962‚Äì63 before two City posts, first as chairman of Arlington Securities (sold to British Aerospace) and then as chairman of another property group, London & Cambridge Investments, which went bust in 1991. He developed a township for 11,500 people at Perton outside Wolverhampton on the family agricultural estate, which had been requisitioned as an airfield during World War II. His wife sustained underwriting losses as a Name in the Lloyd's insurance market in the 1990s. The Times newspaper reported on 24 June 2000, that Lady Mander, having refused a settlement offered to her by Lloyd's, was declared bankrupt. In due course, the mansion house at Little Barrow, Donnington, near Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, was sold to meet a debt believed to be well over one million pounds. *Sir (Charles) Nicholas Mander (born 1950), the elder son of Charles Marcus by Dolores (d. 2007), n√©e Br√∂dermann, of Hamburg, is the fourth baronet, a knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, and a FSA. He lives at Owlpen Manor in Gloucestershire. He was co-founder of Mander Portman Woodward and of Sutton Publishing, and is the author of a history on the family and other books. *(Charles) Marcus Septimus Gustav Mander (born 1975) is the eldest son of Charles Nicholas by Karin Margareta Norin, of Stockholm. He is heir apparent to the baronetcy. He is a barrister of the Middle Temple. Other members of the family *The Hon. Francis Mander (1849‚Äì1942) was a member of the Parliament of New Zealand and of the Legislative Council. He stood first as an Independent Conservative and then from 1909 for the Reform Party. He won the Marsden electorate in Northland in the 1902 general election, which he held until 1922, when he retired. He was subsequently appointed to the Legislative Council in 1923 and served to 1930. In business he was a pioneer sawmiller and owner of The Northern Chronicle newspaper, based in Whangarei. He then purchased a popular newspaper, The Northern Advocate, and closed the Chronicle. He was descended from the above Henry Mander of Aston Cantlow and was the father of the noted New Zealand novelist and journalist, Jane Mander. *Jane Mander (1877‚Äì1949) was one of the foremost New Zealand novelists of the early twentieth century. Her most successful novels were The Story of a New Zealand River (1920) and Allen Adair (1925). She was the daughter of the above Francis Mander and started as a journalist writing for his newspaper, The Northern Advocate. *(Samuel) Theodore Mander (1853‚Äì1900), paint and varnish manufacturer, public servant and philanthropist, was the eldest of seven children of Samuel Small Mander. He was educated at London and Berlin Universities, and at Clare College, Cambridge. He entered the partnership of Mander Brothers with his first cousin Charles Tertius Mander in 1879. As a Congregationalist with an fervent interest in the arts and education, he was active in the building of the Wolverhampton Free Library, governor of several local schools and of Birmingham University (where he endowed a scholarship), and one of the founding benefactors of Mansfield College, Oxford, the first Nonconformist college in the University. A selection of his journals and letters was edited and published in 1996. He was an art collector and patron, and is remembered as the builder of Wightwick Manor in 1887 and 1893 to the designs of Edward Ould, with decorations and furnishings by C.E. Kempe, William Morris and William de Morgan, which was given by his son Geoffrey Mander to the National Trust in 1937. He was an alderman and magistrate, who died in office as Mayor of Wolverhampton at Wightwick Manor on 14 Sept 1901 at the early age of 47, when he was given a civic funeral. *Sir Geoffrey Le Mesurier Mander (1882‚Äì1962), was the eldest son of (Samuel) Theodore Mander, the builder of Wightwick Manor. He was a Midland industrialist and chairman of Mander Brothers, an art collector and radical parliamentarian. He was the Member of Parliament for Wolverhampton East from May 1929 until he lost his seat in the Labour Party landslide at the 1945 general election. He was the Liberal Party specialist on foreign policy between the wars, strongly anti- Appeasement and a crusader on behalf of the League of Nations. He gave Wightwick Manor, with its outstanding collections of Victorian art, to the National Trust in 1937. His second wife, Rosalie Glynn Grylls, was a biographer of writers and artists of the romantic period and an early authority on William Morris and the Pre-Raphaelite movement. *Sir Frederick Mander FEIS (12 July 1883 ‚Äì 27 February 1964) was a headmaster and trade unionist and the General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) from 1931 to 1947. Mander College of Further Education in Bedford College was named after him. Born in Luton, Bedfordshire, he was descended from the above Henry Mander of Aston Cantlow.David Crook, 'Mander, Sir Frederick (1883‚Äì1964)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 14 April 2018 *Miles Mander (1888‚Äì1946), younger brother of Geoffrey, broke away from the mould of public service and industry, and became a well-known character actor of the Hollywood cinema of the 1930s and 1940s, and film director, playwright and novelist. He was an early aviator and racing car enthusiast, who spent his 20s in New Zealand farming sheep. He achieved success in films with The First Born which he directed and acted in, and which was based on his own novel and play. He is better remembered for his character portrayals of oily types, many of them upper-crust villains ‚Äì such as Cardinal Richelieu in The Three Musketeers (1939). In his Hollywood debut, he portrayed King Louis XIII in the 1935 version of that same Alexandre Dumas, p√®re classic. Other films credits included Wuthering Heights with Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon.

Battersby is one of football's journeymen and has played for many clubs both The Football League and non-League. Battersby started his career at Sheffield United, later moving to Notts County, Bury and Lincoln City, before dropping into non-League football. In the summer of 1995 Battersby joined Finnish second division club BK-IFK on loan, scoring 24 goals in just 16 appearances for the Vasa club. He attracted the attention of the Premier League-team VPS Vaasa with his performances with the city rivals BK- IFK, but no deal was ever to be as Battersby returned to Sheffield United in the autumn. Lincoln City In the summer of 2001, Battersby agreed a new three-year contract with Lincoln City. Non-League career 2002‚Äì03 season In October 2002, Lincoln announced that a severance package had been agreed with Battersby and he duly left the club, quickly linking up with neighbours Boston United on a three-month contract. He scored on his Boston debut in the 4‚Äì2 Football League Trophy home victory over Yeovil Town on 23 October 2002 before marking his league debut with another goal in the 3‚Äì1 victory over Rochdale at York Street just three days later. However, he failed to score in his next ten league games for the club and departed at the end of his contract. In January 2003, Battersby linked up with Hucknall Town, scoring a penalty on his debut in the 2‚Äì0 away victory over Lincoln United in the UniBond chairman's Cup quarter-final on 25 January 2003. After impressing in two reserve team games, he agreed to join Rushden & Diamonds on a non-contract basis, debuting in the 2‚Äì2 draw at Darlington on 8 February 2003. With Rushden having a free Saturday, Battersby returned to Hucknall to play in their 1‚Äì1 home draw with Wakefield & Emley on 15 February 2003 before turning out a further four times for Rushden before being released. He moved onto Football Conference side Stevenage Borough, scoring on his debut in a 2‚Äì0 home victory over Kettering Town on 25 March 2003. He scored twice more in four further appearances but his season ended early due to suspension following his sending-off in the 3‚Äì1 home victory over Leigh RMI on 5 April 2003. 2003‚Äì04 season Battersby began the season well, scoring five times, four in an eight-minute spell, in an 11‚Äì0 pre-season victory over Metropolitan Police. In February 2004, having seen a move to Crawley Town for a club record ¬£10,000 fall through, Battersby left Stevenage to join Gravesend & Northfleet. His spell with the Fleet would be short as having come on to make his debut as a 63rd-minute substitute in the 6‚Äì0 home victory over Morecambe on 28 February 2004, a groin injury saw him forced off the field just twenty minutes later and Battersby was released from his contract. Returning to fitness, Battersby saw out the remainder of the season with Cambridge City. 2004‚Äì05 season In May 2004, Battersby agreed a deal to join King's Lynn. In October 2004, he joined Grays Athletic, debuting in a 4‚Äì2 home victory over Welling United on 9 October 2004. Battersby would make 20 league appearances, scoring six times, as Grays went on to claim the Football Conference South title. Grays, with Battersby in the starting eleven, capped the season by claiming the FA Trophy with a victory, on penalties, over Hucknall Town at Villa Park on 22 May 2005. 2005‚Äì06 season Grays began their inaugural season in the Football Conference in fine form, enjoying a run of fifteen games without defeat. Battersby also began the season well, scoring Grays's first ever goal in the conference in the 1‚Äì1 away draw to Burton Albion on 13 August 2005 and netting twice more in his next four games. However, he sustained an injury in the 2‚Äì2 home draw with Kidderminster Harriers on 10 September 2005 and would be sidelined for three months. Returning to fitness, he failed to find the net and in March 2006 he moved on, joining AFC Wimbledon. He made his Dons debut in the 2‚Äì1 away victory over Harrow Borough on 21 March 2006 and scored his solitary goal for the club in the return fixture against Harrow Borough on 22 April 2006 which also resulted in a 2‚Äì1 victory. However, Wimbledon's dreams of promotion from the Isthmian League ended when Fisher Athletic defeated them 2‚Äì1 in the promotion play-off on 2 May 2006; the game would be Battersby's last for the club. 2006‚Äì07 season Battersby began the season with Chelmsford City, making his debut as a final minute substitute in the 1‚Äì1 home draw with Bromley on 19 August 2006. He struggled to make an impression with Chelmsford: making just three league starts with a further six from the bench and failing to find the net. He moved on to join Welling United debuting as a late substitute in the 1‚Äì0 away victory over Cambridge City on 9 December 2006. Battersby was forced to miss the final ten league games of the season to undergo tests on a heart complaint. The Welling manager Adrian Pennock was quoted in the Bexley Times as saying \\"Everyone at the club has got their fingers crossed for Tony and that everything works out for him. He has an enlarged heart muscle and it is better to be safe than sorry.\\" Fortunately, Battersby was able to resume his football career though his time with Welling was at an end. 2007‚Äì08 season In July 2007, Battersby returned to Lincolnshire to link up with Stamford. In February 2008, Stamford's manager Graham Drury departed to manage Corby Town and Battersby was one of seven Stamford players to follow him to the Northamptonshire club. 2008‚Äì09 season In August, Battersby moved to Bourne Town on loan, debuting in the 2‚Äì0 home defeat to Deeping Rangers on 19 August 2008. In November, Battersby moved on to join Bedford Town, debuting in the goalless draw at home to Clevedon Town on 22 November 2008. 2009‚Äì10 season Battersby commenced the season with Bedford Town but, after 37 appearances for the club in all competitions in which he scored nine goals, he rejoined Stamford, debuting in the 2‚Äì0 away victory over Cammell Laird on 31 October 2009. In March 2011 he departed Stamford to join St Albans City. In June 2011 he was appointed player-coach at Deeping Rangers. In late November 2011, Battersby linked up with Northern Premier League Division One South club Grantham Town.

The other quarter-sections are placed in map relationship to the northwest.http://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/tract%20index In each quarter-section area, all transfers are listed in chronological order, often regardless of any subdivisions of the quarter-section. Each entry includes several cross- reference details, such as the names of the grantor (seller) and grantee (purchaser), the description of the parcel, the volume and page of the Deed books, the date, and other identifying characteristics of the transfer (for example, the type of deed). Typically, when one quarter-section fills with its listings of transactions, a new set of pages is begun in the same volume or a later volume, so that all transactions in a period are found in the same volume. The number of sections within a jurisdiction dictates how many volumes are needed for a single period.

One of three films originally planned by Universal Pictures to star Griffith, it also features Lee Meriwether, Jerry Van Dyke, Kay Medford, Henry Jones, Edgar Buchanan, and Gary Collins. Plot The Reverend Samuel D. Whitehead, ex-Marine, bricklayer, and recent seminary graduate, is ecstatic to receive his first \\"calling,\\" or assignment as Pastor of his own church. But the Church of the Redeemer in Wood Falls, Kansas, will prove a challenging assignment and nearly his undoing. The trouble begins almost immediately after he drives into town with his family. A political rally connected with the upcoming mayoral campaign has erupted into a no- holds-barred, knock-down, drag-out brawl, which the sheriff will not stop. Sam attempts to intervene and succeeds only in getting struck in the face, so he drives on to see the church. There he learns that the church sorely needs major renovation, which has not been done in decades because the two founding families, the Sinclairs and the Greshams, have been running a feud for decades and cannot agree on the simplest decision that would benefit the church (or on anything else, either). Worse yet, Sam delivers his first sermon by preaching against physical violence‚Äîonly to discover most of the brawlers in attendance, including one who blames him for making him vulnerable to someone else's assault. Thereafter Sam spends most of his time trying to improvise to provide for the church needs, speak out on various problems in the community, and, ever more frequently, to run interference between the Sinclair and Gresham families. Each of these endeavors brings him trouble. First, his project to secure a new organ for the church leads to a confrontation with the church board when two town gossips witness him obtaining the organ from a house of Burlesque. Sam's brother-in-law, called \\"Bubba,\\" offers to help the caretaker repair the superannuated boiler‚Äîbut unknown to Sam, the two men turn the boiler into a still and start producing raisin jack, a variety of moonshine. Next, he takes his children out of school after seeing the appalling conditions there‚Äîwhich prompts his Bishop to warn him not to interfere in town affairs. Finally, he performs a marriage between a Sinclair and a Gresham‚Äîand when the secret gets out at a church social (after \\"Bubba\\" spikes the church punch with some of his raisin jack), Sam must physically restrain the heads of the families from brawling in the church fellowship hall, and then send everyone home. Not long afterward, the Bishop informs him that he is removed from his pastorate. In one final attempt to save his situation and the community, he persuades his one remaining friend, Attorney Art Shields, to run for mayor as a write-in candidate, with the election two days away. That leads to a confrontation along the main street among three different political parades, including Art's. Then the church's old boiler explodes, and the church burns down to its foundations as a result‚Äîand the attempt by the fire department to fight the fire turns pathetic when the fire hose springs multiple leaks. When the Sinclairs and the Greshams argue yet again about who was responsible for the faulty equipment, Sam roars at them to \\"go someplace else, yell your heads off, and let this poor church die in peace!\\" The next day, the Whiteheads are moving out‚Äîwhen Art Shields joyously announces that he is trouncing the opposition in the election and will definitely be the next mayor. Art offers Sam a job with the town, but Sam declines, saying that he needs to find another church. But as he is about to leave town, Will Sinclair and Axel Gresham‚Äîreconciled at last, and at the head of a procession of building-material trucks‚Äîintercept him, tell him that they intend rebuilding the church, and beg him to stay on. Cast *Andy Griffith as The Reverend Samuel D. Whitehead, Pastor of the Church of the Redeemer, Wood Falls, Kansas *Lee Meriwether as Mary Elizabeth Whitehead, his wife. *Jerry Van Dyke as Emery or \\"Bubba,\\" his shiftless and alcoholic brother-in-law. *Kay Medford as Racine, his mother-in-law. *Henry Jones as Will Sinclair, Mayor of Wood Falls and head of one of the two founding (and feuding) families. *Edgar Buchanan as Axel Gresham, head of the other founding family and Will Sinclair's principal opponent in the mayoral election. *Gary Collins as Art Shields, Attorney at law and write-in candidate for mayor. *Parker Fennelly as Calvin Grey, the caretaker *Jack Dodson as Norman Gresham *Elena Verdugo as Lila Sinclair, whose marriage to Norman brings the families to blows yet again. *Herbie Faye as Mr. Welch *Ellen Corby as Old Woman Themes This film is a comedy that makes great fun of small-town secrets, family feuds, politics, and gossip. The constant bickering between the Sinclairs and the Greshams, and the spectacle of the mayor's office bouncing back and forth between the two families, suggest a satire on the Democratic and Republican Parties. That, during the immediate past Federal election, Presidential Candidate George Wallace famously said, \\"There's not a dime's worth of difference between the two parties,\\" might or might not be a coincidence. There is potentially a bit of borrowing from \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" in that the families of the two people wanting to marry, are sworn enemies of each other, with the Gresham and Sinclair families easily being mistaken for the feuding Montague and Capulet families. The movie never identifies the denomination to which the \\"Church of the Redeemer\\" is supposed to belong. The presence of a Bishop, the vestments that Sam Whitehead wears, Sam's prefacing of his sermon with collect and the fact that his title is \\"pastor\\" suggest that the denomination is Methodist which has an Episcopal system or possibly one of the groups which formed the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Another possibility is the Episcopal Church, however the title given to the senior minister in an Episcopal parish is \\"rector,\\" not \\"pastor.\\" Background and production This film was one of three originally planned by Universal Pictures to feature Andy Griffith in the wake of his television series' success. Griffith's disappointment in this film led to a cancellation of the project. Hence, the other two films were never made. Griffith, Van Dyke and Fennelly would all go on to star in the TV series Headmaster in 1970. After that series failed halfway through its first and only season, Griffith teamed up with Meriwether to star in The New Andy Griffith Show, which ran for the rest of that season in Headmaster's time slot. Reception Information on the film's box-office reception is sketchy. NBC Television telecast it as part of their Saturday Night at the Movies program. The film has appeared on television only infrequently after that, and has never been released to home video.

Context The last major legislation on road traffic was the Motor Car Act 1903. Amendments had been discussed in 1905, 1913 and 1914 as the Motor Car Act (1903) Amendment Bill and Motor Car Act (1903) Amendment (No 2) Bill. Since 1926 in which there were 4,886 fatalities in some 124,000 crashes a detailed set of national statistics (now known as Road Casualties Great Britain) had been collected. It was not until 1929 that a new Road Traffic Bill was discussed in detail following a Royal Commission report on Transport, \\"The control of traffic on roads,\\" which was adopted almost in its entirety. During a parliamentary debate on making speedometers compulsory in 1932 it was suggested that speed limits for cars were removed by this Act because \\"the existing speed limit was so universally disobeyed that its maintenance brought the law into contempt\\" rather that for considerations of safety. Clauses The Act repealed the Locomotive Act of 1865, the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 and the Motor Car Act 1903 and introduced many new regulations which controversially included the removal of all speed limits on UK roads for motor cars. Relating to motor cars *Abolition of all speed limits for cars *Introduction of driving offences of dangerous, reckless and careless driving and driving whilst being unfit and under the influence of drink or drugs *Compulsory third-party insurance *The first UK driving tests for disabled drivers only *Classification of motor vehicles *Construction, weight and equipment of motor vehicles *Issue of Highway Code For public service vehicles *Central regulation of UK coach services *Introduction of a 30-mile an hour speed limit for buses and coaches. *Issue of public service vehicles *Rules regarding the conduct of drivers, conductors and passengers on public service vehicles. *Limitation of hours of continuous driving It was amended in 1988 and at other times. Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Act 1930 The Road Traffic Act 1930 was strengthened by the Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Act 1930. Legacy Many clauses introduced by the Act have been retained. Regulations relating to insurance, licensing and driving offences have continued to evolve since that date.

He came originally from Hackney Wick, his younger brother was the Olympic boxer Fred Mallin. He lived in Dartmouth Park, North London and was a police officer with the Metropolitan Police. Boxing career Mallin was British Champion five years in a row from 1919 to 1923. He was also world champion in the middleweight class between 1920 and 1928. He never lost an amateur bout and never turned professional. In the 1920 Summer Olympics he won a gold medal in middleweight division, defeating Canadian boxer Georges Prud'Homme in the final. In 1924 he went on to win another gold in the same weight class. In that year, he met Roger Brousse of France in the quarter-finals, and after the decision came down 2‚Äì1 in favour of Brousse, Mallin showed the referee fresh teeth marks on his chest, which further examination proved that Mallin had definitely been bitten by his French opponent. Brousse was disqualified, clearing the way for Mallin to win his second gold medal. After the incident versus Brousse, Mallin was referred to by one reporter as \\"the unroasted human beef of Old England\\". Mallin was the first to successfully defend an Olympic title in two consecutive games, and remained for 92 years the only British boxer to do so until the victory of Nicola Adams at the 2016 Summer Olympics Subsequently, he managed the British Olympic boxing teams at the 1936 and 1952 Summer Olympics. In 1937, he achieved the distinction of being the first British television sports commentator, when he gave commentary on two boxing matches that were broadcast by the BBC from Alexandra Palace.

It has one of the most diverse herbaceous plant floras of ecoregions in North America. Setting This is a large region, mainly of rolling plain except for the Ozark plateau and other smaller areas of plateau and basin in Kentucky and Tennessee. The region contains the large system of sandstone caves in Mammoth Cave National Park. The region was designated by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and is a fraction of what others consider the Central Hardwood Forest of the Central Hardwood Region, which would include the northern hardwood forest to the north. (cites definition by Braun 1950) This is an inland area with a fairly dry climate.  Flora  The pre- Columbian dominant ecosystems in this region were oak savannas with woodlands and forests of oak and hickory. Today only small areas of oak and hickory woodland remain, mixed with dogwoods, sassafras trees and hop hornbeams. The ecoregion contains large areas of prairie as well as wetter meadows that are home to tulip trees and sweetgums. Fauna Birds of the woodlands include vireos and tanagers while mammals include Eastern gray squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons and opossums.  Threats  The dominance of oak in this part of the pre-Columbian savannas of North America was due to frequent fires. The fire suppression policies since the 1930s have been a significant forest disturbance. Today there is very little intact habitat in this ecoregion, with a reduction of bottomland hardwood forests by 70‚Äì95%, and only 0.02 percent of the original oak savannas remain. Although much of the area is forested, these forests tend to be highly fragmented and significantly altered by development, agriculture, and fire suppression. The forests are dominated primarily by oak and hickory species, but succession has filled the understory with maples and yellow poplar and blocking oak regeneration. In some areas, habitat is threatened by urbanization and invasive species such as non-native privet, honeysuckle, garlic mustard and kudzu. Significant natural areas in the ecoregion include: Wolf River (Tennessee), the Cedar glades and the western Highland Rim of Tennessee; Mammoth Cave National Park; the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area of Tennessee and Kentucky; Hoosier National Forest and Yellowwood State Forest in southern Indiana; the Edge of Appalachia Preserve in Ohio; the Cache River (Illinois) wetlands and the Shawnee Hills in southern Illinois; and the Ozarks in Missouri including Mark Twain National Forest. The best preserved of these are Mammoth Cave, Edge of Appalachia, and parts of the Missouri Ozarks and the Tennessee Cedar Glades.

Origin Native to southern India and Sri Lanka, where it usually occurs in seasonal ponds, becoming dormant in the dry season,Tropica: Aponogeton crispus Aponogeton crispus is found naturally in both still and running waters. Description It is a seasonally submerged aquatic plant with a round rhizome 2‚Äì3 cm and up to 5 cm in diameter.Christel Kasselmann, Aquarium Plants, 2003, s.v. \\"Aponogeton crispus\\". The leaves are light green to olive green-brown, 8 ‚Äì 14 inches (20‚Äì35 cm) long and 2.5 inches (6 cm) broad, with a wavy margin and a petiole up to 18 inches (45 cm) long; wild plants tend to have longer and narrower leaves than the cultivated varieties. No floating leaves are formed. The flowers are produced on an erect stem up to 80 cm tall with an apical white (- pink) spike-like raceme up to 18 cm long; each flower is small, with a 2 mm perianth and six stamens. The flowers are scented, and a flowering spike will last 1 ‚Äì 2 weeks. The seeds are elliptical, 5‚Äì6 mm long and 2 mm diameter. Many plants sold in the aquarium trade are actually hybrids and many are sterile. The genuine plant never has leaves that float on the surface of the water. It is a protected plant in Sri Lanka, where A. crispus is banned from exportation under Section 24 (1) of Forest Ordinance. Cultivation and uses Aponogeton crispus is often cultivated as an aquarium plant and is probably the easiest and most robust of the aponogetons. It requires a mineral-rich substrate where carbon dioxide is easily available in the form of carbonic acid.Kasselmann 2003. It prefers moderate to bright lighting from above, and will tolerate a wide temperature range, c. 15 ‚Äì 32C. It does better planted in an established aquarium because of its liking for a nutrient rich environment. When these conditions are met a mass of leaves will be formed and flowering will often occur. It doesn't normally need a dormant period under aquarium conditions but will sometimes lose its larger leaves and can be rested in cooler water for about two months; hence it is often grown in removable pots. A. crispus is one of the aponogetons that eventually require a dry storage during a dormancy, of which the onset is recognized by the gradual ripening off and loss of leaves. Propagation is by seed or by carefully splitting the rhizome. The seeds have two prolongations which in horizontal position get curved and stuck into marshy ground forming the initial roots. Flowers can be pollinated with a soft brush and the resulting seeds sown in a propagater at normal room temperatures. They take several weeks to germinate. When both leaves and roots can be seen they can be potted in a peat-based compost and covered with water.

The East Kent Road Car Company Ltd was a bus company formed in 1916 and based in Canterbury, Kent. The company operated bus and coach services in Kent. In 1993 it was one of the first companies to be acquired by the Stagecoach Group, which eventually rebranded the operation as Stagecoach in East Kent, and made it part of the Stagecoach South East bus division. East Kent serves the area after which it was named and at one time also served part of East Sussex, operations in Rye and Hastings passing to Maidstone & District Motor Services in return for that company's Ashford interests. Since acquisition by the Stagecoach Group, the company has made some radical alterations to its traditional route network, linking some services into long distance circulars. History Formation East Kent Road Car Company Limited was officially formed on 11 August 1916. It was an amalgamation of Deal & District Motor Services, Wacher & Co (Herne Bay), Margate Canterbury & District, Ramsgate Motor Coaches, and Folkestone & District. The new company began trading on 1 September 1916. From 1928, the Southern Railway became a significant (49%) shareholder in the company. From 1929, an arrangement was made with the General Post Office where letter boxes would be installed on some vehicles. Moving into the 1930s saw the take overs of the tramways of Dover and Thanet, with the trams being quickly replaced with motor buses. During the Second World War, East Kent vehicles were regular targets for enemy aircraft and their long-range guns from across The Channel, on the French coast, before the fall of France. To try to combat this, the cream-coloured roofs of the buses were repainted grey to help make them less visible. The company experienced many vehicle losses during this time, especially at Dover where the garage suffered a direct hit in 1942, killing several staff. Lots of the vehicles had been lent out or contracted away, some stationed in the Midlands; and this, coupled with those written off by enemy action, led to severe shortages. This was alleviated, somewhat, with the delivery of 10 Guy Arabs with utility Park Royal bodywork. Post-war After the war, orders were placed for 50 Leyland Tiger PS1 coaches and 60 Dennis Lancet single decker service buses. These arrived between 1946 and 1949. In September 1946, East Kent ordered 50 Leyland Titan PD1As with Leyland bodywork. These were delivered in 1947 and 1948. East Kent was one of many operators to use rebodied buses as a way to extend their service life. Prewar Leyland Titans went to ECW for this treatment whilst 28 Leyland Titan TD5s were rebuilt as coaches by Beadle at Dartford. The company began to standardise on Guy Arabs for double decker buses and AEC Reliances for single deckers and coaches, although Dennises and Leylands were also acquired. In the mid-1950s, two of the company's bus stations were rebuilt, Folkestone and Canterbury - both surviving today in refurbished form. East Kent AEC Regent V on Southsea Common In the late 1950s, East Kent launched its first open-top bus service with conversion of some of the wartime Guys. Painted in the reverse cream and red livery, they operated out of Thanet Garage. Later, Herne Bay, Dover and Folkestone also operated open-top vehicles. Around this time, the first AEC Regent Vs arrived. These were delivered to Thanet and were bodied by Park Royal to a full front, front entrance design and arrived in 1959. Later, AEC Regents reverted to the half cab layout, but all were bodied by Park Royal and many would survive into the late 1970s and early 1980s. AEC also became the main supplier of single-deck buses and coaches, too, with batches of BET style bodied AEC Reliances entering the fleet as well as Park Royal, Plaxton and Duple bodied coaches. National Bus Company East Kent Leyland National and AEC Swift in Dover, 1980 East Kent was taken over by the National Bus Company on 1 January 1969, during this time the company's first rear engined double deckers arrived. These were 20 Daimler Fleetlines with Park Royal bodywork for Thanet garage. These were also the Company's first OMO (one man operated) double deckers. Later on some AEC Regents were also converted to OMO to reduce the cost of having 2 crew on each bus but these tended to be used only at peak hours. In 1971 the last buses were delivered in the traditional maroon and cream livery, these were 12 AEC Swifts with Alexander bodywork. Leyland Nationals started to enter the fleet in the 1970s bringing with them the National Bus Company standard livery of Poppy Red and white. In the mid-1970s the Bristol VRT entered the fleet, the first batch having 14'6\\" ECW bodywork. Later batches had rare Willowbrook bodies before the final batch reverted to the standard 13'8\\" ECW body, by that time the NBC's standard vehicle. These cleared the last of the AEC Regents from normal passenger service in the early 1980s although some had a swan song on the park and ride for the Open Golf and Sandwich, whilst others were used on contracts and for driver training. Deregulation On Sunday 26 October 1986, all the bus companies were deregulated. East Kent management entered into negotiations with the NBC sales team in October 1986 and following some hot competition from a French bidder, the company was sold to the management team on 5 March 1987. The NBC 'double arrow' was quickly removed from the vehicles to be replaced by a red EK in a white box. A new livery was introduced of cherry red and cream but it would take several years to completely remove all the NBC livery. Minibuses had entered the fleet in a big way, cutting a dash in bold yellow 'Minilink' livery. These vehicles were used to boost ailing passenger numbers by serving estates not accessible to larger vehicles and offering a better frequency of service. Also to help cover a new route network introduced, 12 Leyland Atlanteans from Northern General arrived. These were later replaced by more Atlanteans from Greater Manchester Transport. The Company's first new double deckers for nearly 7 years arrived in the form of 10 MCW Metrobuses. Meanwhile, 2 new MCW Hi-Liner coaches were purchased for the coaching fleet. More Metrobuses arrived the following year, some fitted with coach seating. Later, when MCW ceased production, the Company turned, once again, to Leyland for new buses, these being Olympians with Northern Counties bodywork. 1991 saw East Kent celebrate 75 years of service and MCW Metrobus 7755 (E755UKR) was repainted in the traditional livery. In the summer of 1993, the management sold out to a bid from the Perth-based transport group, Stagecoach Group. The coaching side of the business was soon sold off by Stagecoach, as were two garages and part of Westwood (Thanet) Garage, for redevelopment. The then standard Stagecoach livery began to creep into East Kent. Eventually, the maroon and cream was replaced by the original Stagecoach corporate colours of white with orange, red and blue stripes. Stagecoach invested heavily in new vehicles and upgrading routes. East Kent also gained the contract for operating the Canterbury Park and Ride around this time, a service they still operated until late 2008 when they lost it to Kent Top Travel who operated it until the summer of 2013 when it was regained by East Kent. During 2002, Canterbury Bus Station was given a makeover, and in 2004 Folkestone Bus Station was also refurbished. Low-floor buses on branded routes have become a big part of Stagecoach's business plans. It has also introduced a new livery and the company now trades as 'Stagecoach in East Kent', although the legal lettering remains unchanged. Today, branded routes such as The Loop, The Diamond, The Triangle, The Link, The Stars and The Heart operate in every major town in the area with low-floor, easy-access buses. The old East Kent habit of referring to the buses as cars still survives.

The coup d'√©tat, which was Thailand's first non- constitutional change of government in fifteen years, followed a year-long political crisis involving Thaksin, his allies, and political opponents and occurred less than a month before nationwide House elections were scheduled to be held. It has been widely reported in Thailand and elsewhere that General Prem Tinsulanonda, Chairman of the Privy Council, was the mastermind of the coup. The military cancelled the scheduled 15 October elections, abrogated the 1997 constitution, dissolved parliament and constitutional court, banned protests and all political activities, suppressed and censored the media, declared martial law nationwide, and arrested cabinet members. The new rulers, led by General Sonthi Boonyaratglin and organised as the Council for Democratic Reform (CDR), issued a declaration on 21 September setting out their reasons for taking power and giving a commitment to restore democratic government within one year. However, the CDR also announced that after elections and the establishment of a democratic government, the council would be transformed into a Council of National Security (CNS) whose future role in Thai politics was not explained.Bangkok Post, 25 September 2006, Military set to publish interim constitution The CNS later drafted an interim charter and appointed retired General Surayud Chulanont as Premier.

General Sonthi later said in an interview that the coup was originally planned for 20 September, to coincide with a major anti-Thaksin rally also planned for that day.

For some analysts, the silence of both the King and Privy Council President General Prem Tinsulanonda on the day following the coup was taken as indicating support. remarks made earlier in 2006 by Thaksin had been widely understood as a criticism of Prem's continued influence in Thai politics. Royal endorsement is critical to establishing legitimacy for military rebellions. Every successful coup over the past 60 years has been endorsed by King Bhumibol. Previous unendorsed coups in 1981 and 1985 failed after at most a few days. For background, see King Bhumibol's role in Thai politics. On 14 July 2006, Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda addressed graduating cadets of the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, telling them that the Thai military must obey the orders of the king, not the government. At the time that special forces started mobilizing from Lopburi to Bangkok, Prem was having an audience with the king. This led to speculation outside Thailand that the king had advance knowledge of the coup, or even that he had executive control over it, although there was no direct evidence for this. The day after the coup, the king endorsed it and its leader. Given the extensive reserve powers retained by the king, this statement gave legitimacy to the coup and legal authority to Sonthi's position. Some Thai analysts have said that the king must have at least been in favour of the coup. \\"The role of the king was critical in this crisis,\\" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak of Chulalongkorn University, adding that \\"This coup was nothing short of Thaksin versus the King. He is widely seen as having implicitly endorsed the coup.\\" Thitinan said he believed the king had allowed the coup to take place as it was the best option available. \\"What we were heading for otherwise was violence in the streets,\\" he said. Sulak Sivaraksa, a well-known social critic, said, \\"Without his involvement, the coup would have been impossible.\\" Sulak added that the king is \\"very skillful. He never becomes obviously involved. If this coup goes wrong, Sonthi will get the blame, but whatever happens, the King will only get praise.\\"Kate McGeown, Thai king remains centre stage, BBC News, 21 September 2006 The Bangkok correspondent of The Australian, Peter Alford, wrote: \\"The King's overriding commitment has always been to social stability...and by December last year, he had clearly lost any faith in Thaksin's capacity to govern without wedging the country apart...All Prem need do is refrain from criticising the coup... for almost all Thais to believe they know the King's will.\\"\\"Peter Alford: Tears for democracy, not Thaksin,\\" The Australian, 21 September 2006 On 13 April 2008, the Asia Sentinel wrote: \\"Never mind elections, the fate of Thaksin's proxy party could be decided, yet again, by Thailand's royalist judges and generals. Thailand's proxy war between loyalists to deposed Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and Bangkok's royalist elite is stirring once again, with the outcome as uncertain as ever.\\" National reactions The coup occurred after nearly two years of escalating anti-Thaksin sentiment, particularly in Bangkok. Even long-standing rural supporters of Thaksin reported increasing frustration at the tensions caused by the Thailand political crisis 2005-2006.The Christian Science Monitor, Thai coup uproots a thin democracy, 21 September 2006 Public support for the coup has been widely aired and published whilst public expression of opinion against the coup has been limited by the military control over the media, the ban on protests and political activity, and the arrest of some cabinet members by the junta. Protest has also arisen from both pro- and anti- Thaksin supporters and is directed against the use of military power to resolve a political stalemate. Protest is also limited following the king's endorsement of the coup and the junta's use of a royal decree that legitimizes the coup. See also Censorship in Thailand.

The story explores what might have happened when Europeans colonised land already inhabited by Aboriginal people.Kate Grenville: Secret River, Secret Past Channel 9 Sunday Art Profile The book has been compared to Thomas Keneally's The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith and to Peter Carey's True History of the Kelly Gang for its style and historical theme. Background The Secret River was inspired by Grenville's desire to understand the history of her ancestor Solomon Wiseman, who settled on the Hawkesbury River at the area now known as Wisemans Ferry.Grenville, Kate (2006), Searching for The Secret River, Text, Melbourne, Her inspiration to understand this came from her taking part in the 28 May 2000 Reconciliation Walk across Sydney Harbour Bridge during which she realised that she didn't know much about the early interactions between the settlers and the Aboriginal people. Initially intended to be a work of non-fiction about Wiseman, the book eventually became a fictional work based on her research into Wiseman but not specifically about Wiseman himself. The novel took five years and twenty drafts to complete. The novel is dedicated to the Aboriginal people of Australia.Grenville (2005), The Secret River, Dedication page Although sparking hostility from some historians such as the likes of an Australian academic, Mark McKenna, who published an article in which he criticized Kate Grenville, claiming that Grenville had referred to The Secret River as a \\"work of history,\\", however, he could not provide a source for the statement.https://www.gradesaver.com/the-secret-river/study- guide/controversy-surrounding-the-secret-river It received a positive response from many Aboriginal people, Grenville has said \\"they recognise that the book is my act of acknowledgement, my way of saying: this is how I'm sorry\\". Adaptations The Secret River has been adapted for the stage by Andrew Bovell; the play was presented by the Sydney Theatre Company in January 2013 and included in the Edinburgh International Festival in August 2019.

Thornhill then gets sent to Sydney on a boat, by himself. After 9 months, Thornhill is finally able to reunite with his family in Australia. Sal becomes Thornhill's master, and Thornhill obtained a ticket of leave, one year later, after he demonstrated good behaviour. His son, Willie is already five years old, and Willie could not recognize his father, after being away from him for so long. Thornhill now also has another son, Richard, whom he called Dick. During his first night in this new land, Thornhill encounters an Aboriginal and struggles to communicate with him. The following weeks, Thornhill went to work as a lighterman for Mr. King. Thornhill then brought the alcohol, which he got from Mr. King, back home, to set up his own bar, named the \\"Pickled Herring.\\" Scabby Bill was a regular customer, who would entertain the customers, by dancing for money. Three years later, and Thornhill quits his job and works for Thomas Blackwood, a former convict who is attempting to reconcile himself with the place and its people. Blackwood lived on the Hawkesbury River, with his boat, \\"the Queen\\". Thornhill also met Smasher Sullivan, a man whose fear of this alien world turns into brutal depravity towards it. Thornhill soon realises that the Aboriginal people of Australia have a different concept of land ownership, as compared to the white settlers, and notices that many of the Aboriginals were stealing his corn. Thornhill realises that Blackwood has an Aboriginal wife, and son. Shocked, he goes on to tell his wife about it. He also gave the black people names, to tell them apart easily, and renamed some of them as \\"Whisker Harry\\", \\"Long Bob\\" and \\"Black Dick\\". Thornhill was also shocked to see his son, Dick playing with the Aboriginal people, and he beat up Dick. As Thornhill and his family stake their claim on a patch of ground by the river, the battle lines between old and new inhabitants are drawn.Fantastic Fiction review Soon after, Saggity, a friend of Smasher Sullivan was killed after a raid on his farm by Aborigines, it is Saggity's death that leads to the battle with the Aborigines. Blackwood tries to stop the fighting, but gets whipped by Smasher. In the battle between the settlers and the Aborigines many casualties are sustained on both sides, Whisker Harry kills Sullivan, while he gets shot in the stomach, and long Jack gets shot in the head. Though Thornhill is a loving husband and a good father, his interactions with indigenous inhabitants are villainous. Thornhill dreams of a life of dignity and entitlement, manifested in his desire to own land. After befriending Blackwood under his employ, Thornhill finds a patch of land he believes will meet his needs, but his past comes back to haunt him. His interactions with the Aboriginal people progress from fearful first encounters to (after careful observation) appreciation. The desire for him to own the land contrasts with his wife wanting to return to England.The Quarterly Conversation review The clash is one between a group of people desperate for land and another for whom the concept of ownership is bewildering.Poster, Jem. Cultures in collision The Guardian, book review 29 January 2006 A decade later, and William Thornhill becomes the wealthiest man in the area. He builds his own house, but he has always felt that something felt off. He also bought a new boat, named \\"Sarah\\" and renamed \\"Darkey's Creek\\" to \\"Thornhill's Point.\\" Long Jack continued to stay, at Thornhill's Point, when all the other natives had fled. Thornhill's son, Dick, leaves him to live with Blackwood, and Thornhill's friendship with Blackwood also deteriorates, which leads Thornhill to have a sense of guilt of his actions.

He was the only surviving son of John Scollay, a strong supporter of colonial rights and a member of Boston's Board of Selectmen in 1764. William was extremely active in the community and was named a Colonel in the Boston Regiment. The Scollays originally came from the Orkney Islands. Scollay gave his name to the area through his ventures in real estate. In 1795 William Scollay purchased a two-story house on Court Street, locally known as Scollay's Building. The name arose as the stage line's last stop was at the Scollay Building and the conductors would yell \\"Last stop, Scollay's Building! Everybody off.\\" Eventually the name changed to Scollay's Square and was officially recognised by Boston in 1838. The Scollays ended their association with the square in 1868 when they sold Scollay's Building. Three years later the building was torn down. William Scollay's sister, Priscilla married Colonel Thomas Melvill, a participant in the Boston Tea Party. Thomas and Priscilla's grandson was author Herman Melville.

Although nanotechnology is a relatively recent development in scientific research, the development of its central concepts happened over a longer period of time. The emergence of nanotechnology in the 1980s was caused by the convergence of experimental advances such as the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981 and the discovery of fullerenes in 1985, with the elucidation and popularization of a conceptual framework for the goals of nanotechnology beginning with the 1986 publication of the book Engines of Creation. The field was subject to growing public awareness and controversy in the early 2000s, with prominent debates about both its potential implications as well as the feasibility of the applications envisioned by advocates of molecular nanotechnology, and with governments moving to promote and fund research into nanotechnology. The early 2000s also saw the beginnings of commercial applications of nanotechnology, although these were limited to bulk applications of nanomaterials rather than the transformative applications envisioned by the field.  Early uses of nanomaterials  The earliest evidence of the use and applications of nanotechnology can be traced back to carbon nanotubes, cementite nanowires found in the microstructure of wootz steel manufactured in ancient India from the time period of 600 BC and exported globally. Although nanoparticles are associated with modern science, they were used by artisans as far back as the ninth century in Mesopotamia for creating a glittering effect on the surface of pots. In modern times, pottery from the Middle Ages and Renaissance often retains a distinct gold- or copper- colored metallic glitter. This luster is caused by a metallic film that was applied to the transparent surface of a glazing, which contains silver and copper nanoparticles dispersed homogeneously in the glassy matrix of the ceramic glaze. These nanoparticles are created by the artisans by adding copper and silver salts and oxides together with vinegar, ochre, and clay on the surface of previously-glazed pottery. The technique originated in the Muslim world. As Muslims were not allowed to use gold in artistic representations, they sought a way to create a similar effect without using real gold. The solution they found was using luster.  Conceptual origins  Richard Feynman Richard Feynman gave a 1959 talk which many years later inspired the conceptual foundations of nanotechnology. The American physicist Richard Feynman lectured, \\"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom,\\" at an American Physical Society meeting at Caltech on December 29, 1959, which is often held to have provided inspiration for the field of nanotechnology. Feynman had described a process by which the ability to manipulate individual atoms and molecules might be developed, using one set of precise tools to build and operate another proportionally smaller set, so on down to the needed scale. In the course of this, he noted, scaling issues would arise from the changing magnitude of various physical phenomena: gravity would become less important, surface tension and Van der Waals attraction would become more important. After Feynman's death, a scholar studying the historical development of nanotechnology has concluded that his actual role in catalyzing nanotechnology research was limited, based on recollections from many of the people active in the nascent field in the 1980s and 1990s. Chris Toumey, a cultural anthropologist at the University of South Carolina, found that the published versions of Feynman‚Äôs talk had a negligible influence in the twenty years after it was first published, as measured by citations in the scientific literature, and not much more influence in the decade after the Scanning Tunneling Microscope was invented in 1981. Subsequently, interest in ‚ÄúPlenty of Room‚Äù in the scientific literature greatly increased in the early 1990s. This is probably because the term ‚Äúnanotechnology‚Äù gained serious attention just before that time, following its use by K. Eric Drexler in his 1986 book, Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology, which took the Feynman concept of a billion tiny factories and added the idea that they could make more copies of themselves via computer control instead of control by a human operator; and in a cover article headlined \\"Nanotechnology\\", published later that year in a mass-circulation science-oriented magazine, Omni. Toumey‚Äôs analysis also includes comments from distinguished scientists in nanotechnology who say that ‚ÄúPlenty of Room‚Äù did not influence their early work, and in fact most of them had not read it until a later date. These and other developments hint that the retroactive rediscovery of Feynman‚Äôs ‚ÄúPlenty of Room‚Äù gave nanotechnology a packaged history that provided an early date of December 1959, plus a connection to the charisma and genius of Richard Feynman. Feynman's stature as a Nobel laureate and as an iconic figure in 20th century science surely helped advocates of nanotechnology and provided a valuable intellectual link to the past. Norio Taniguchi The Japanese scientist called Norio Taniguchi of Tokyo University of Science was first to use the term \\"nano-technology\\" in a 1974 conference, to describe semiconductor processes such as thin film deposition and ion beam milling exhibiting characteristic control on the order of a nanometer. His definition was, \\"'Nano-technology' mainly consists of the processing of, separation, consolidation, and deformation of materials by one atom or one molecule.\\" However, the term was not used again until 1981 when Eric Drexler, who was unaware of Taniguchi's prior use of the term, published his first paper on nanotechnology in 1981. K. Eric Drexler K. Eric Drexler developed and popularized the concept of nanotechnology and founded the field of molecular nanotechnology. In the 1980s the idea of nanotechnology as a deterministic, rather than stochastic, handling of individual atoms and molecules was conceptually explored in depth by K. Eric Drexler, who promoted the technological significance of nano-scale phenomena and devices through speeches and two influential books. In 1980, Drexler encountered Feynman's provocative 1959 talk \\"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom\\" while preparing his initial scientific paper on the subject, ‚ÄúMolecular Engineering: An approach to the development of general capabilities for molecular manipulation,‚Äù published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 1981. The term \\"nanotechnology\\" (which paralleled Taniguchi's \\"nano-technology\\") was independently applied by Drexler in his 1986 book Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology, which proposed the idea of a nanoscale \\"assembler\\" which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity. He also first published the term \\"grey goo\\" to describe what might happen if a hypothetical self-replicating machine, capable of independent operation, were constructed and released. Drexler's vision of nanotechnology is often called \\"Molecular Nanotechnology\\" (MNT) or \\"molecular manufacturing.\\" His 1991 Ph.D. work at the MIT Media Lab was the first doctoral degree on the topic of molecular nanotechnology and (after some editing) his thesis, \\"Molecular Machinery and Manufacturing with Applications to Computation,\\" was published as Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation, which received the Association of American Publishers award for Best Computer Science Book of 1992. Drexler founded the Foresight Institute in 1986 with the mission of \\"Preparing for nanotechnology.‚Äù Drexler is no longer a member of the Foresight Institute.  Experimental research and advances  In nanoelectronics, nanoscale thickness was demonstrated in the gate oxide and thin films used in transistors as early as the 1960s, but it was not until the late 1990s that MOSFETs (metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor field-effect transistors) with nanoscale gate length were demonstrated. Nanotechnology and nanoscience got a boost in the early 1980s with two major developments: the birth of cluster science and the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). These developments led to the discovery of fullerenes in 1985 and the structural assignment of carbon nanotubes in 1991. The development of FinFET in the 1990s aldo laid the foundations for modern nanoelectronic semiconductor device fabrication. Nanoscale transistors In 1960, Egyptian engineer Mohamed Atalla and Korean engineer Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs fabricated the first MOSFET (metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor field-effect transistor) with a gate oxide thickness of 100 nm, along with a gate length of 20¬µm. In 1962, Atalla and Kahng fabricated a nanolayer-base metal‚Äìsemiconductor junction (M‚ÄìS junction) transistor that used gold (Au) thin films with a thickness of 10 nm. In 1987, Iranian engineer Bijan Davari led an IBM research team that demonstrated the first MOSFET with a 10 nm gate oxide thickness, using tungsten-gate technology. Multi-gate MOSFETs enabled scaling below 20 nm gate length, starting with the FinFET (fin field-effect transistor), a three-dimensional, non-planar, double-gate MOSFET. The FinFET originates from the DELTA transistor developed by Hitachi Central Research Laboratory's Digh Hisamoto, Toru Kaga, Yoshifumi Kawamoto and Eiji Takeda in 1989. In 1997, DARPA awarded a contract to a research group at UC Berkeley to develop a deep sub-micron DELTA transistor. The group consisted of Hisamoto along with TSMC's Chenming Hu and other international researchers including Tsu-Jae King Liu, Jeffrey Bokor, Hideki Takeuchi, K. Asano, Jakub Kedziersk, Xuejue Huang, Leland Chang, Nick Lindert, Shibly Ahmed and Cyrus Tabery. The team successfully fabricated FinFET devices down to a 17nm process in 1998, and then 15nm in 2001. In 2002, a team including Yu, Chang, Ahmed, Hu, Liu, Bokor and Tabery fabricated a 10nm FinFET device. In 2006, a team of Korean researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and the National Nano Fab Center developed a 3 nm MOSFET, the world's smallest nanoelectronic device. It was based on gate-all-around (GAA) FinFET technology. Invention of scanning probe microscopy The scanning tunneling microscope, an instrument for imaging surfaces at the atomic level, was developed in 1981 by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at IBM Zurich Research Laboratory, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986. Binnig, Calvin Quate and Christoph Gerber invented the first atomic force microscope in 1986. The first commercially available atomic force microscope was introduced in 1989. IBM researcher Don Eigler was the first to manipulate atoms using a scanning tunneling microscope in 1989. He used 35 Xenon atoms to spell out the IBM logo. He shared the 2010 Kavli Prize in Nanoscience for this work. Advances in interface and colloid science Interface and colloid science had existed for nearly a century before they became associated with nanotechnology. The first observations and size measurements of nanoparticles had been made during the first decade of the 20th century by Richard Adolf Zsigmondy, winner of the 1925 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, who made a detailed study of gold sols and other nanomaterials with sizes down to 10 nm using an ultramicroscope which was capable of visualizing particles much smaller than the light wavelength. Zsigmondy was also the first to use the term \\"nanometer\\" explicitly for characterizing particle size. In the 1920s, Irving Langmuir, winner of the 1932 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and Katharine B. Blodgett introduced the concept of a monolayer, a layer of material one molecule thick. In the early 1950s, Derjaguin and Abrikosova conducted the first measurement of surface forces. In 1974 the process of atomic layer deposition for depositing uniform thin films one atomic layer at a time was developed and patented by Tuomo Suntola and co-workers in Finland. In another development, the synthesis and properties of semiconductor nanocrystals were studied. This led to a fast increasing number of semiconductor nanoparticles of quantum dots. Discovery of fullerenes Fullerenes were discovered in 1985 by Harry Kroto, Richard Smalley, and Robert Curl, who together won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Smalley's research in physical chemistry investigated formation of inorganic and semiconductor clusters using pulsed molecular beams and time of flight mass spectrometry. As a consequence of this expertise, Curl introduced him to Kroto in order to investigate a question about the constituents of astronomical dust. These are carbon rich grains expelled by old stars such as R Corona Borealis. The result of this collaboration was the discovery of C60 and the fullerenes as the third allotropic form of carbon. Subsequent discoveries included the endohedral fullerenes, and the larger family of fullerenes the following year. The discovery of carbon nanotubes is largely attributed to Sumio Iijima of NEC in 1991, although carbon nanotubes have been produced and observed under a variety of conditions prior to 1991. Iijima's discovery of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the insoluble material of arc-burned graphite rods in 1991 and Mintmire, Dunlap, and White's independent prediction that if single-walled carbon nanotubes could be made, then they would exhibit remarkable conducting properties helped create the initial buzz that is now associated with carbon nanotubes. Nanotube research accelerated greatly following the independent discoveries by Bethune at IBM and Iijima at NEC of single-walled carbon nanotubes and methods to specifically produce them by adding transition-metal catalysts to the carbon in an arc discharge. In the early 1990s Huffman and Kraetschmer, of the University of Arizona, discovered how to synthesize and purify large quantities of fullerenes. This opened the door to their characterization and functionalization by hundreds of investigators in government and industrial laboratories. Shortly after, rubidium doped C60 was found to be a mid temperature (Tc = 32 K) superconductor. At a meeting of the Materials Research Society in 1992, Dr. T. Ebbesen (NEC) described to a spellbound audience his discovery and characterization of carbon nanotubes. This event sent those in attendance and others downwind of his presentation into their laboratories to reproduce and push those discoveries forward. Using the same or similar tools as those used by Huffman and Kratschmer, hundreds of researchers further developed the field of nanotube-based nanotechnology. Government and corporate support National Nanotechnology Initiative Mihail Roco of the National Science Foundation formally proposed the National Nanotechnology Initiative to the White House, and was a key architect in its initial development. The National Nanotechnology Initiative is a United States federal nanotechnology research and development program. ‚ÄúThe NNI serves as the central point of communication, cooperation, and collaboration for all Federal agencies engaged in nanotechnology research, bringing together the expertise needed to advance this broad and complex field.\\" Its goals are to advance a world-class nanotechnology research and development (R&D;) program, foster the transfer of new technologies into products for commercial and public benefit, develop and sustain educational resources, a skilled workforce, and the supporting infrastructure and tools to advance nanotechnology, and support responsible development of nanotechnology. The initiative was spearheaded by Mihail Roco, who formally proposed the National Nanotechnology Initiative to the Office of Science and Technology Policy during the Clinton administration in 1999, and was a key architect in its development. He is currently the Senior Advisor for Nanotechnology at the National Science Foundation, as well as the founding chair of the National Science and Technology Council subcommittee on Nanoscale Science, Engineering and Technology. President Bill Clinton advocated nanotechnology development. In a 21 January 2000 speech at the California Institute of Technology, Clinton said, \\"Some of our research goals may take twenty or more years to achieve, but that is precisely why there is an important role for the federal government.\\" Feynman's stature and concept of atomically precise fabrication played a role in securing funding for nanotechnology research, as mentioned in President Clinton's speech: President George W. Bush further increased funding for nanotechnology. On December 3, 2003 Bush signed into law the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, which authorizes expenditures for five of the participating agencies totaling US$3.63 billion over four years. The NNI budget supplement for Fiscal Year 2009 provides $1.5 billion to the NNI, reflecting steady growth in the nanotechnology investment. Other international government and corporate support Over sixty countries created nanotechnology research and development (R&D;) government programs between 2001 and 2004. Government funding was exceeded by corporate spending on nanotechnology R&D;, with most of the funding coming from corporations based in the United States, Japan and Germany. The top five organizations that filed the most intellectual patents on nanotechnology R&D; between 1970 and 2011 were Samsung Electronics (2,578 first patents), Nippon Steel (1,490 first patents), IBM (1,360 first patents), Toshiba (1,298 first patents) and Canon (1,162 first patents). The top five organizations that published the most scientific papers on nanotechnology research between 1970 and 2012 were the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Russian Academy of Sciences, Centre national de la recherche scientifique, University of Tokyo and Osaka University. Growing public awareness and controversy \\"Why the future doesn't need us\\" \\"Why the future doesn't need us\\" is an article written by Bill Joy, then Chief Scientist at Sun Microsystems, in the April 2000 issue of Wired magazine. In the article, he argues that \\"Our most powerful 21st-century technologies ‚Äî robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotech ‚Äî are threatening to make humans an endangered species.\\" Joy argues that developing technologies provide a much greater danger to humanity than any technology before it has ever presented. In particular, he focuses on genetics, nanotechnology and robotics. He argues that 20th-century technologies of destruction, such as the nuclear bomb, were limited to large governments, due to the complexity and cost of such devices, as well as the difficulty in acquiring the required materials. He also voices concern about increasing computer power. His worry is that computers will eventually become more intelligent than we are, leading to such dystopian scenarios as robot rebellion. He notably quotes the Unabomber on this topic. After the publication of the article, Bill Joy suggested assessing technologies to gauge their implicit dangers, as well as having scientists refuse to work on technologies that have the potential to cause harm. In the AAAS Science and Technology Policy Yearbook 2001 article titled A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists, Bill Joy was criticized for having technological tunnel vision on his prediction, by failing to consider social factors. In Ray Kurzweil's The Singularity Is Near, he questioned the regulation of potentially dangerous technology, asking \\"Should we tell the millions of people afflicted with cancer and other devastating conditions that we are canceling the development of all bioengineered treatments because there is a risk that these same technologies may someday be used for malevolent purposes?\\". Prey Prey is a 2002 novel by Michael Crichton which features an artificial swarm of nanorobots which develop intelligence and threaten their human inventors. The novel generated concern within the nanotechnology community that the novel could negatively affect public perception of nanotechnology by creating fear of a similar scenario in real life. Drexler‚ÄìSmalley debate Richard Smalley, best known for co-discovering the soccer ball-shaped ‚Äúbuckyball‚Äù molecule and a leading advocate of nanotechnology and its many applications, was an outspoken critic of the idea of molecular assemblers, as advocated by Eric Drexler. In 2001 he introduced scientific objections to them attacking the notion of universal assemblers in a 2001 Scientific American article, leading to a rebuttal later that year from Drexler and colleagues, and eventually to an exchange of open letters in 2003. Smalley criticized Drexler's work on nanotechnology as naive, arguing that chemistry is extremely complicated, reactions are hard to control, and that a universal assembler is science fiction. Smalley believed that such assemblers were not physically possible and introduced scientific objections to them. His two principal technical objections, which he had termed the ‚Äúfat fingers problem\\" and the \\"sticky fingers problem‚Äù, argued against the feasibility of molecular assemblers being able to precisely select and place individual atoms. He also believed that Drexler‚Äôs speculations about apocalyptic dangers of molecular assemblers threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology. Smalley first argued that \\"fat fingers\\" made MNT impossible. He later argued that nanomachines would have to resemble chemical enzymes more than Drexler's assemblers and could only work in water. He believed these would exclude the possibility of \\"molecular assemblers\\" that worked by precision picking and placing of individual atoms. Also, Smalley argued that nearly all of modern chemistry involves reactions that take place in a solvent (usually water), because the small molecules of a solvent contribute many things, such as lowering binding energies for transition states. Since nearly all known chemistry requires a solvent, Smalley felt that Drexler's proposal to use a high vacuum environment was not feasible. Smalley also believed that Drexler's speculations about apocalyptic dangers of self-replicating machines that have been equated with \\"molecular assemblers\\" would threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology. To address the debate between Drexler and Smalley regarding molecular assemblers Chemical & Engineering News published a point-counterpoint consisting of an exchange of letters that addressed the issues. Drexler and coworkers responded to these two issues in a 2001 publication. Drexler and colleagues noted that Drexler never proposed universal assemblers able to make absolutely anything, but instead proposed more limited assemblers able to make a very wide variety of things. They challenged the relevance of Smalley's arguments to the more specific proposals advanced in Nanosystems. Drexler maintained that both were straw man arguments, and in the case of enzymes, Prof. Klibanov wrote in 1994, \\"...using an enzyme in organic solvents eliminates several obstacles...\\" Drexler also addresses this in Nanosystems by showing mathematically that well designed catalysts can provide the effects of a solvent and can fundamentally be made even more efficient than a solvent/enzyme reaction could ever be. Drexler had difficulty in getting Smalley to respond, but in December 2003, Chemical & Engineering News carried a 4-part debate. Ray Kurzweil spends four pages in his book 'The Singularity Is Near' to showing that Richard Smalley's arguments are not valid, and disputing them point by point. Kurzweil ends by stating that Drexler's visions are very practicable and even happening already. Royal Society report on the implications of nanotechnology The Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering's 2004 report on the implications of nanoscience and nanotechnologies was inspired by Prince Charles' concerns about nanotechnology, including molecular manufacturing. However, the report spent almost no time on molecular manufacturing. In fact, the word \\"Drexler\\" appears only once in the body of the report (in passing), and \\"molecular manufacturing\\" or \\"molecular nanotechnology\\" not at all. The report covers various risks of nanoscale technologies, such as nanoparticle toxicology. It also provides a useful overview of several nanoscale fields. The report contains an annex (appendix) on grey goo, which cites a weaker variation of Richard Smalley's contested argument against molecular manufacturing. It concludes that there is no evidence that autonomous, self replicating nanomachines will be developed in the foreseeable future, and suggests that regulators should be more concerned with issues of nanoparticle toxicology.  Initial commercial applications  The early 2000s saw the beginnings of the use of nanotechnology in commercial products, although most applications are limited to the bulk use of passive nanomaterials. Examples include titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles in sunscreen, cosmetics and some food products; silver nanoparticles in food packaging, clothing, disinfectants and household appliances such as Silver Nano; carbon nanotubes for stain-resistant textiles; and cerium oxide as a fuel catalyst. As of March 10, 2011, the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies estimated that over 1300 manufacturer- identified nanotech products are publicly available, with new ones hitting the market at a pace of 3‚Äì4 per week. The National Science Foundation funded researcher David Berube to study the field of nanotechnology. His findings are published in the monograph Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz. This study concludes that much of what is sold as ‚Äúnanotechnology‚Äù is in fact a recasting of straightforward materials science, which is leading to a ‚Äúnanotech industry built solely on selling nanotubes, nanowires, and the like‚Äù which will ‚Äúend up with a few suppliers selling low margin products in huge volumes.\\" Further applications which require actual manipulation or arrangement of nanoscale components await further research. Though technologies branded with the term 'nano' are sometimes little related to and fall far short of the most ambitious and transformative technological goals of the sort in molecular manufacturing proposals, the term still connotes such ideas. According to Berube, there may be a danger that a \\"nano bubble\\" will form, or is forming already, from the use of the term by scientists and entrepreneurs to garner funding, regardless of interest in the transformative possibilities of more ambitious and far-sighted work. Commercial nanoelectronic semiconductor device fabrication began in the 2010s. In 2013, SK Hynix began commercial mass-production of a 16nm process, TSMC began production of a 16nm FinFET process, and Samsung Electronics began production of a 10nm process. TSMC began production of a 7 nm process in 2017, and Samsung began production of a 5 nm process in 2018. In 2019, Samsung announced plans for the commercial production of a 3nm GAAFET process by 2021.

It runs for in an irregular south-to-north pattern in eastern Alfalfa County, in the northwest part of the state. The highway begins at U.S. Route 64 (US-64) in Jet and extends to SH-11. SH-38 provides access to Great Salt Plains State Park, which the road skirts on the park's eastern edge. The road that is now SH-38 was added to the state highway system as SH-35 circa 1961. The highway was renumbered to SH-38 the following year.  Route description  State Highway 38 begins at an intersection with U.S. Highway 64 in downtown Jet. The road heads northward along a section line for approximately . The highway then makes a sharp turn to the east along another section line to avoid the Great Salt Plains Lake. The highway only heads east for about one mile (1.6 km) before turning back to the north; one mile further north, the highway makes a turn to the east, again avoiding the lake. After traveling east for , SH-38 is forced to turn back to the north by Kegelman Air Force Auxiliary Field, a secondary airfield of Vance Air Force Base. As the highway continues north, it forms the boundary between Kegelman AFAF to the east and the Great Salt Plains State Park to the west. Upon crossing the Salt Fork Arkansas River, the road turns back to the west, entering the park. Within the park boundaries, SH-38 is again forced to change course by the Great Salt Plains Lake, and turns back to a due north heading. One mile (1.6 km) north of the turn, the highway passes through the unincorporated place of Vining. SH-38 continues north, coming to an end at SH-11.  History  The SH-38 designation was originally given to an alignment from SH-58 in Carrier south to US-60 and SH-15 (now US-412). The majority of this route had been reassigned to SH-45, with the remainder being added to SH-132, by 1963. The road that is now SH-38 was added to the state highway system in late 1961 to early 1962 as SH-35. When the SH-38 designation was freed up in 1962, SH-35 was renumbered to SH-38. No further changes to the route have occurred since then.

In insects, it starts when the fat body stimulates the release of juvenile hormones and produces vitellogenin protein. It occurs in all animal groups other than the mammals. In cockroaches, for example, vitellogenesis can be stimulated by injection of juvenile hormone into immature females and mature males. Chemically yolk is lipoprotein composed of proteins, phospholipids and neutral fats along with a small amount of glycogen. The yolk is synthesised in the liver of the female parent in soluble form. Through circulation it is transported to the follicle cells that surround the maturing ovum, and is deposited in the form of yolk platelets and granules in the ooplasm. The mitochondria and Golgi complex are said to bring about the conversion of the soluble form of yolk into insoluble granules or platelets. In mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium, vitellogenesis may be manipulated by the parasites to reduce fecundity. In mammalian vitellogenesis, vitellogenin is the major protein, produced by the Vit gene and regulated by oestrogen. The yolk consists of lipids (triglycerides, cholesterol etc.) and proteins, mainly vitellogenin.

The supervisory authority is delegated to the Federal Railway Authority of Germany. Karlsruhe tram-train system The BOStrab regulations are not as strict as the EBO main railway regulations; for example the BOStrab does not specify a strict loading gauge to follow. A third law ESBO () covers narrow- gauge railway regulations. The distinctions for these light rail systems are slightly different from in the UK Tramways Act 1870 / Light Railways Act 1896. Some Stadtbahn systems are subject to both BOStrab and EBO regulations as their vehicles use both types of networks. This is common with tram-train systems - apart from a technical switch on the boundary (e.g. EMUs need to change from 750 V to 15 kV) a different set of safety regulations needs to be followed (e.g. tramways are run on sight while main railways use block control).

The ¬ß 16 BOStrab defines the legal types of trackbed: : Street running trackbed (\\"\\"): :: These tramways are running directly along public streets, without any separation which makes them subject to rules of the road as automobiles. As such the streetcars need to be equipped with mirrors and blinkers. : Exclusive Trackbed (\\"\\"): :: The tramway is part of the urban traffic structure but its railroads are separated from other traffic by an embankment, trees or curbs giving them an exclusive right of way. There may be railroad crossings marked with signs or traffic lights that regulate the access. : Independent Trackbed (\\"\\"): :: The railway is independent of the urban traffic structure which in most cases has the railroad trackbed grade- separated in the city. The law allows level crossing as they are common outside of the city centre. If the tramway is street running or the crossings of the exclusive trackbed do not fit in the scope of ¬ß 20 BOStrab then tramways are limited to a maximum length of and a maximum width of .

Set initially at 3% above inflation it was increased in two stages to 6% before being suspended and then, in 2011, replaced by a 'fuel duty stabiliser' (also known as the 'fuel price stabiliser' and 'fair fuel stabiliser') following further increases in the price of oil. History Fuel Price Escalator At a time of rapidly rising concerns about the effect of road transport on the environment, and in particular from the program of road building which had resulted in major road protests, at Twyford Down and other locations, the Conservatives under John Major introduced a 'Fuel Price Escalator' in March 1993 set initially at 3% ahead of inflation per year, increased to 5% later in the same year, and then increased again to 6% in 1997 by the Blair ministry after Labour won power. The last rise due to the escalator took place following the budget on 9 March 1999 at a time of rapidly increasing oil prices. In 2000 at a time of rising protests at the cost of fuel Gordon Brown announced that the prices would only be increased by inflation due to the high price of oil. Fuel Duty Stabiliser Increases were deferred for a number of budgets and then in 2011, at a time of rapidly increasing oil prices, George Osborne cut 1p from the tax, increased the Petroleum Revenue Tax to raise at additional ¬£2bn from North Sea oil firms, and announced that the escalator would be replaced with a 'fuel price stabiliser'. but would rise if oil prices fell below $75 per barrel. In the 2011 budget the Chancellor had also announced a rise of 1p in January 2012 and then 5p in August 2013, but later cancelled the 1p rise and reduced the 5p August rise to 3p in November 2012. In the budget of 2012 Osborne confirmed the 3p August rise, before first postponing it and then cancelling it in December 2012. A further proposed inflation-based increase in fuel duty was cancelled by the chancellor in March 2013. In March 2016, with oil prices at about $40 a barrel, and following widespread speculation that the duty would be increased at a time of record low oil prices, the chancellor froze fuel duty for the sixth year running, and reduced the tax on North Sea oil firms.

Southdown Motors Services Ltd (although this was the legal name of the company (until 1992) it was normally referred to as Southdown Motor Serviceshttps://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/00140534) was a bus and coach operator in East and West Sussex and parts of Hampshire, in southern England. It was formed in 1915 and had various owners throughout its history, being purchased by the National Bus Company (NBC) in 1969. The company fleet name was lost when it was acquired by the Stagecoach Group in 1989 but buses operated under that legal name until 2015 when the operating licence was transferred to another company within the Stagecoach Group and 1915 company became dormant but still owned by the Stagecoach Group.https://www.vehicle- operator-licensing.service.gov.uk/view-details/licence/20122 Early years Leyland Tiger, previously run by Southdown as fleet number 649. Leyland Titan, previously run by Southdown as fleet number 422. A now preserved Leyland Leopard, previously run by Southdown as fleet number 122. Southdown Motor Services can trace its history back to a pair of steam buses which operated between Pulborough and Worthing. However the company itself was formed in 1915, abandoning plans to call itself South Coast Motor Services (a similar name had been registered by a Folkestone operator). British Electric Traction (BET) took an early interest in the company, as did Thomas Tilling. The original registered office was in Middle Street, Brighton and in 1916, a garage was built in Freshfield Road. The operating area of the company was bounded by Eastbourne, Portsmouth and the Sussex border. In 1921, joint services with Maidstone & District Motor Services (M&D;) were started between Brighton and Hawkhurst (later service 18) and Eastbourne and Hastings via Hailsham (15). Similar services to Southampton and Winchester (joint with Hants & Dorset) began in 1922, although the Winchester service was truncated at Fareham in 1926. Horsham marked the boundary with Aldershot & District, Southdown later abandoning its operations in Haslemere in favour of the Aldershot company. Southdown also began to establish a programme of local long distance tours throughout the twenties and it was in 1921 that the famous Southdown scroll logo was adopted. Southdown pursued a policy of purchasing rival operators to consolidate its business. Companies acquired included Royal Red Coaches of Hove and Eastbourne operators Foard's, Cavendish, Southern Glideway and Chapman & Sons. Expansion Regular express services began in 1924, initially between Brighton and London (Lupus Street). It was a Southdown coach which was the first vehicle to enter Victoria Coach Station on 10 March 1932 (fleet number 202 - a Tilling-Stevens). Southdown turned to Hove coach builder Harrington for coach bodies, an arrangement that continued until the 1960s. In 1929 the company started a coastal express service between Bournemouth and Margate, joint with East Kent Road Car Company and Hants & Dorset in competition with an existing Royal Blue service. This service later known as the South Coast Express (and eventually joint with Royal Blue) continued until NBC days. Southdown's early orders favoured Tilling-Stevens chassis until the outbreak of World War II, although some all-Leyland Titans provided the company with its first closed top vehicles in 1929. The Titan continued to be the favoured double deck chassis until the end of BETs interest in the company. Oil engines were favoured and bodywork provided by a number of different coachbuilders, although Park Royal provided the majority of bus bodies, a relationship which continued into the NBC period. Southdown benefited from the establishment of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, gaining services previously operated by East Surrey and Autocar in the Weald south of East Grinstead and Crawley. This also extended the company's eastern boundary to Heathfield. Southdown became associated with BET following the division of Tilling and BET in 1942. The war was a difficult time in many ways for the company, although the casualties from enemy action remained low. Southdown's assistant traffic manager devised a scheme to overcome delays caused by the blackout on country routes by extending journey times on evening services, ensuring that connections would be maintained. In 1946, a co- ordination agreement with Portsmouth Corporation was reached, splitting mileage and receipts on a 57:43 share, Southdown being the minority. This often had the result, at the end of the year, that buses from one operator would be put onto routes of the other to balance the mileage. The driver/conductor would not change, thereby working on a 'foreign' vehicle. This replaced an earlier agreement dating from 1931 involving protective fares on Southdown routes within the city. The co-ordination of services, dubbed Portsmouth Area Joint Transport Services, lasted until deregulation in 1986. After the war, Southdown started its first overseas tours with a 17-day tour to France and Switzerland in 1950, operated by Leyland Tiger number 1223. This coach was transferred to Ulster in 1951 where it became the first to operate a programme of Irish tours for the company. 1950 also saw the introduction of scenic open top services from Brighton to Devil's Dyke and Eastbourne to Beachy Head, operated by decapitated war time Guys. Beacon Motor Services of Crowborough was fully acquired in 1954 (although it had been controlled by Southdown since 1949). The company also controlled three services operated by Sargents of East Grinstead although these passed to M&D; in 1951. In 1957 Southdown also entered into the Heathfield Pool agreement (also known as the Heathfield Cycle) with M&D; by which all services through Heathfield became joint operations. In 1958, mileage agreements were reached with the London Transport Executive for services in Crawley and with Brighton & Hove and Brighton Corporation for services in Brighton - establishing Brighton Area Transport Services, similar to the arrangements in Portsmouth established in the previous decade. The post war building programme continued with garages established at Crawley, Hassocks, Moulsecoomb and Seaford, while bus stations were opened in Chichester, Haywards Heath and Lewes. It was during the late 1950s and 1960s that Southdown purchased many of the vehicle types most commonly associated with the company, notably the Leyland Titan PD3 'Queen Mary' vehicles. Southdown did not take any deliveries of rear engined double deck vehicles until 1970 when it purchased a batch of Daimler Fleetlines with Northern Counties bodywork similar to that on later PD3s for Brighton & Hove and a number of Bristol VRTs with Eastern Coach Works (ECW) bodies painted in green and cream livery. A further batch of Fleetlines with ECW bodywork was delivered in 1972. In 1964, Southdown moved into new headquarters in Freshfield Road, which also became the headquarters of Brighton Hove & District in 1969 when that company passed to Southdown. The only visible difference at first was the addition of 2000 to the fleet numbers. Later vehicles were painted in Southdown's green and cream livery with the fleetname 'Southdown BH&D;'. With the advent of NBC, green/white livery was adopted and the BH&D; suffix dropped from the fleetname, although by 1985 most Brighton area Southdown vehicles carried Brighton & Hove fleetnames, being operated as a dedicated section of the company within the former BH&D; area. National Bus Company A now preserved Leyland National, previously run by Southdown as fleet number 37. It is in the National Bus Company Southdown Livery. Leyland Nationals were the standard NBC single decker choice. A now preserved Leyland Titan PD3, previously run by Southdown as fleet number 419. It is also in the post NBC purchase livery. In 1969 Southdown became part of the National Bus Company. Little change was noticeable at first, the corporate green and white livery not appearing until the early 1970s. There was, however, an influx of rear-engined double decker vehicles into the fleet, starting with Bristol VRTs and later Leyland Atlantean AN68s with Park Royal bodywork. The Leyland National became the standard single deck bus while the Leyland Leopard fulfilled coach orders. Southdown succeeded in maintaining a certain individuality during its NBC years, even painting some coaches in traditional livery and fleetnames (albeit with a small NBC logo). 1971 also saw the transfer of most Crawley services to and from London Country - a newly formed organisation within the National Bus Company. 1975 saw the forerunner of the 'Stagecoach' limited stop services with the 51 mile Brighton to Portsmouth Coastliner route 700. The following year saw the introduction of the 'Solenteer' between Portsmouth and Southampton (X71), operated jointly with Hants & Dorset. On the launch of both these services, messages were exchanged between the mayors of the terminus towns. This was followed by the Regency Route (729) in 1977 between Brighton and Tunbridge Wells, operated jointly with M&D.; These routes were rebranded (somewhat ironically) as Stage Coach in 1982. The network included services from Brighton to Worthing, Bognor Regis, Chichester and Portsmouth (700), Newhaven and Eastbourne (712), Lewes, Uckfield and Tunbridge Wells (729), Haywards Heath (770) and between Eastbourne and East Grinstead (780) and Rye via Hastings (799). The Stage Coach brand was also applied to occasional services to Winchester and Salisbury (710), Hawkhurst and Canterbury (718), Windsor and St Albans (735), and Oxford (738). Southdown shared the operation of the Flightline 777 Service between Crawley, Gatwick Airport and London Victoria with London Country's Green Line operation. This service initially used Leyland Leopards, and latterly Leyland Tigers, and was one of four \\"airport network\\" service connecting Gatwick, Heathrow, Luton and Stansted with Central London. Privatisation Southdown celebrated its 70th anniversary in 1985, the year before deregulation, and buses carried a special logo (shown above) which also appeared on publicity. With deregulation, the company adopted \\"Southdown East & Mid Sussex\\" and \\"Southdown West Sussex\\" fleetnames, while the Brighton & Hove operations became a separate company (Brighton & Hove). The East Sussex division registered a fairly basic network from the outset, linking a number of services together to form trunk services linking the major towns, sometimes by fairly circuitous routes. A version of Southdown's traditional livery was adopted, albeit with less cream than on the pre-NBC incarnation. The scroll fleetname returned on minibus operations and eventually the operations (except Brighton) were re-unified as Southdown. Southdown was acquired by the Stagecoach Group in August 1989. A few vehicles (mainly Leyland Nationals) soon received the original Stagecoach white and stripes livery, albeit with the fleetname bearing \\"SOUTHDOWN - Part of the Stagecoach Group\\". Southdown's existence ended effectively in 1992 when the company changed its name to South Coast Buses Ltd, using the fleet names \\"In East Sussex\\" and \\"Coastline Buses\\" for the west. Upon the closure of the depot in Eastbourne in 2003, operations were split with the eastern end becoming \\"Stagecoach in Hastings\\" and the western division becoming \\"Stagecoach in the South Downs\\". The legal title of the western division then reverted to Southdown Motor Services Ltd. Until 2005, Stagecoach had four depots remaining in East Sussex (Eastbourne Outstation, Lewes, Seaford, Uckfield); the business in this area was sold to Brighton & Hove along with 15 buses and 66 staff. Vehicles and artefacts of the old company are preserved at Amberley Museum & Heritage Centre by the Southdown Omnibus Trust. In 2008, the Leyland PD3 or \\"Queen Marys\\" celebrated 50 years of operation, with many events held across the Southdown area. Between 2000 and 2005 Queen Marys were operated on route 77 between Brighton and Devil's Dyke during the summer months by Southcoast Motor Services which is an operator specialising in operating preserved ex-Southdown buses. Southcoast Motor Services took its name from the original proposed name of Southdown Motor Services.

M. Stirling. It was released in the United States and Canada on February 1, 1998 and in the United Kingdom a month later on March 1. Plot summary At 9:15 pm EST on March 17, 1998, the island of Nantucket, Massachusetts and the United States Coast Guard cutter Eagle, are transported by an unknown phenomenon (called \\"The Event\\") back in time to the Bronze Age circa 1250s B.C. (corresponding to the late Heroic Age of the Trojan War). As the truth of what has happened sinks in, panic grips the island. Chief of Police Jared Cofflin is given emergency powers and begins organizing the people to help produce food for the island so they can feed themselves. Meanwhile, Captain Marian Alston takes the Eagle to Britain, with Ian Arnstein and Doreen Rosenthal as interpreters, where they trade Nantucket- made goods with the Iraiina, which translates as \\"noble ones\\", a tribe that has been steadily invading the island, for grain. The Iraiina are just one of the many Sun People Tribes. As a gift, the Iraiina chief gives Marian a slave, Swindapa, a captured female \\"Earth People\\" warrior. Swindapa is freed and decides to stay with Marian. The Eagle leaves for Nantucket but takes with them Isketerol, a Tartessian merchant who hopes to learn from the Americans. While the people of Nantucket work for their survival, the ambitious and ruthless Lieutenant William Walker of the USCGC Eagle decides that with modern technology he could become a king in this time. With the help of Isketerol and others, Walker convinces some naive environmentalists to steal a ship and kidnap Cofflin's wife so they can give the benefits of modern culture to Native Americans. Meanwhile, Walker and Isketerol steal another ship and return to Britain to recruit soldiers for their eventual takeover of Greece. Marian decides to rescue Cofflin's wife first and saves her after defeating an Olmec army. The bloodthirsty Olmecs proceed to gruesomely kill the modern Americans who sought to help them. Time passes as Walker solidifies his control over the Sun People and Nantucket creates a new government and prepares to take down Walker. Marian returns to Britain with a small army and uses Swindapa, who has become her lover, to convince the Earth People to fight with them to defeat Walker. Both sides meet at the Battle of the Downs and though Nantucket and its allies are victorious, Walker manages to escape with his followers to Greece.

History One of the few benefits that Wizards of the Coast saw from their purchase of Last Unicorn Games was The Wheel of Time Roleplaying Game (2001), created by the Last Unicorn team and built upon their licensing expertise. The game consists of two publications by Wizards of the Coast, a core rulebook published in October 2001 and an expansion, The Prophecies of the Dragon, which followed in April 2002. Shortly after the release of Prophecies of the Dragon, Wizards of the Coast confirmed that they would not be proceeding with any further expansions for the game. The roleplaying game rights have since reverted to the estate of Robert Jordan. The rulebook The core rulebook is a 317-page large-format hardcover book. It was written and compiled by Charles Ryan, Steven Long, Christian Moore and Owen K.C. Stephens for Wizards of the Coast. Robert Jordan served as creative consultant and contributed an introduction, in which he revealed that he used to serve as Dungeon Master in Dungeons and Dragons games played by his stepson Will and his friends. The book has a cover by Darrell K. Sweet, who also provides the covers for the novels, and maps by Ellisa Mitchell, who likewise provides cartography for the novels. A large number of artists provide full-color art throughout the book. The rulebook is based on the D20 rules system used by the third edition of Dungeons and Dragons, also published by Wizards of the Coast, and follows a similar layout and format to the D&D; core rulebooks. However, the term 'Dungeon Master' is not used (as this is reserved for D&D; products only), being replaced by the more generic 'gamemaster' to refer to the player running the game. Backgrounds and character classes The game does not use different races, as in the novels there are only two sentient, naturally- evolved species, namely humans and Ogier (optional rules for playing an Ogier are provided). Instead, different backgrounds are provided which serve a similar function. These are Aiel, Atha'an Miere (Sea Folk), Borderlander, Cairhienin, Domani, Ebou Dari, Illianer, Midlander (principally a native of Andor but also Far Madding, Ghealdan, Murandy, Amadicia and northern Altara), Tar Valoner, Taraboner and Tairen. The standard D&D; character classes have been replaced by new ones: algai'd'siswai (Aiel spear-carrier), Armsman (soldier), Initiate (in the Aes Sedai or other-culture counterparts, or Asha'man), Noble, Wanderer, Wilder (untrained user of the One Power) or Woodsman (similar to a D&D; Ranger). It is also possible to multiclass (having different levels in different classes). The Wheel of Time Roleplaying Game also shares D&D; 3rd Edition's use of prestige classes, which add additional abilities to the existing classes. The prestige classes used in the Wheel of Time Roleplaying Game are: Aes Sedai, Asha'man, Blademaster, Commander (military officer), Gleeman, Thief-Taker, Warder, Windfinder, Wise One and Wolfbrother. Feats and skills The use of Feats and Skills is similar to D&D; 3rd Edition. However, specialist feats allowing use of the One Power also exist. There are also special 'Lost Ability' Feats which can be used to replicate abilities in the books, such as talking to wolves (like Perrin Aybara and Elyas Machera), viewing the future (like Min Farshaw), dreamwalking, foretelling, and the ability to 'sniff' out violence (as Hurin, in The Great Hunt). Other sections There is a chapter discussing equipment and weaponry, a further chapter discussing how to run and play Wheel of Time Roleplaying Game adventures, and notes on using characters from the series as non-player characters. There is also an extensive chapter discussing rules for the use of the One Power (including how to handle male channellers and the threat of madness). Setting and background information There is a lengthy section about the setting and history of The Wheel of Time, much of which comes from the novels and The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time. However, there is information included which is unique to this product, including the exact circumstances under which countries such as the Borderlands, Cairhien, Illian, Tarabon and Tear were founded during the War of the Hundred Years. Maps The book features re-drawn, full-color and larger-scaled maps of the cities of Ebou Dar, Caemlyn, Cairhien and Tar Valon. Maps of these cities previously appeared in the novels. The maps of Tanchico and Far Madding from the books are not reprinted. Of greater interest are the never-before-seen maps of the capital cities of Tear and Illian. There is also another map of the main continent, similar to the one found in the hardcovers of the later novels. Introductory adventure There is an adventure called 'What Follows in Shadow', set during the events of The Eye of the World, which features the adventuring party running afoul of Padan Fain during the procession of Logain Ablar through the city. The adventure ends with the adventurers lost in the Ways, ready for the events of The Prophecies of the Dragon adventure book. Web enhancement A web enhancement for the game was released on the Wizards of the Coast website at the same time the book was published. This short downloadable file contained a few new Feats and channelling abilities, information on new NPCs and background information on the countries of Ghealdan, Mayene and Murandy (including new information on their histories not found elsewhere). This web enhancement is no longer available through the Wizards of the Coast website. Dragon Magazine Dragon Annual #6 2001, included new content for the rpg. Two articles were presented in the magazine, content included beasts of the wheel of time and new hero templates for quick character creation. Prophecies of the Dragon Prophecies of the Dragon is the only expansion to The Wheel of Time Roleplaying Game that was published. It is a 191-page large-format softcover book. It was written by Aaron Acevedo, Evan Jamieson, Michelle Lyons, James Maliszewski, Charles Ryan and Paul Sudlow for Wizards of the Coast. Again, cartography was handled by Ellisa Mitchell and a new cover was produced by Darrell K. Sweet. Robert Jordan is listed as creative consultant. Concept The concept behind the book is to provide a massive roleplaying campaign which runs alongside the storyline of the first six Wheel of Time novels. The campaign is broken into a series of five major episodes with a number of smaller 'mini-adventures' leading into the campaign or to serve as diversions between the main adventures. Robert Jordan has ruled the new information revealed in the book about certain characters (namely Mazrim Taim) non-canonical. Mini-adventures The mini-adventures are designed to get the players from wherever they ended up at the end of the 'What Follows in Shadow' adventure in the RPG core rulebook to where the longer campaign begins, on Toman Head, or to serve as interludes in the main campaign. The first mini-adventure, 'Howls in the Night', sees the players investigating a series of wolf attacks on a remote village. 'Escort Duty' has them escorting a wealthy merchant to the Murandian capital of Lugard. In 'Hunters for the Horn' reports emerge that the Horn of Valere can be found in the Hills of Kintara and the PCs are drawn into the search for the artifact. 'The Watchtower' sees the PCs taking on a Draghkar which has set up a lair in a watchtower overlooking the road from Tarabon to Arad Doman. 'My Secret Friend', set after the Seanchan invasion, has the PCs investigating the disappearance of a young boy who is trying to nurse a lopar back to health, and getting involved with Shadowspawn sent to spy on the Seanchan advance. 'I Want to Stay Single' has the PCs hired by the son of the mayor of Ostin Falls, a town on the border between Toman Head and Almoth Plain, who is evading an arranged marriage by investigating reports of fighting on Toman Head. This adventure can also act as a springboard into the main campaign. The main campaign The main campaign consists of five sequential, serialised adventures. *'Toman Head' has the adventurers employed by an Aes Sedai to investigate reports of unusual events taking place in the city of Falme. This adventure has the adventurers becoming involved in the climax of the novel The Great Hunt. *'Winter of Discontent' takes the adventurers from Falme to Arad Doman (where they run afoul of Jaichim Carridin and the Black Ajah) and then to Saldaea where they have to free the false Dragon Mazrim Taim from the Red Ajah, which results in Taim owing them a favour. This adventure takes place during the events of The Dragon Reborn and The Shadow Rising. *'The Two Rivers' features the adventurers pursuing the Black Ajah sisters south into the Two Rivers, where they become involved in the battle with the Trollocs and Children of the Light as detailed in The Shadow Rising. This is the first time the adventurers have to interact with major characters from the book, namely Loial and Verin Mathwin. *'The Ancient City' continues the journey, with the adventurers pursuing the Black Ajah sisters into the wilds south of Emond's Field and eventually to the ruined Manetheren city of Jara'copan, where the Black Ajah hopes to find a ter'angreal of enormous power called the Artifice of Brassion, a device which bestows upon an Aes Sedai powers only capable of normally when linking. Thus a single sister using the Artifice can sever or gentle any male channeller by herself. This episode is designed so that the adventurers cannot stop the Black sisters securing the Artifice for use against Rand al'Thor. *'Dumai's Wells' has the adventurers pursuing the Black Ajah sisters to Cairhien, then becoming involved in the plot to kidnap of Rand al'Thor by the White Tower delegation (as depicted in the novel Lord of Chaos). According to the adventure, it is the players who alert Mazrim Taim and the Asha'man to the threat to Rand and Taim, repaying the favour he owes them from earlier, takes them with him to the Battle of Dumai's Wells. Whilst the rest of the battle is being fought, the adventurers confront and defeat the Black Ajah sisters and capture or destroy the Artifice of Brassion. The campaign concludes at this point. Given that the players will have likely reached the attention of Rand himself by the end of the campaign, it falls to the gamemaster to decide what adventures follow through the remainder of the novels. Maps Prophecies of the Dragon features a number of new maps, including the towns of Aturo's Orchard and Tobin's Hollow on Toman Head (all created for this book), plus the city of Falme and a general map of the western coast of the continent, stretching from Tanchico to Bandar Eban. The town of Denhuir in Saldaea is also shown. The map of the Two Rivers from The Eye of the World is reprinted in full color as well. Finally, there are maps showing the Battle of Emond's Field from The Shadow Rising and the Battle of Dumai's Wells from Lord of Chaos.

The company had a nominal share capital of ¬£100 of which only ¬£2 was paid up. The original subscribers were J D Tattersall and E M Walker, both employees of the Transport Holding Company. The company's paid up capital remained the same throughout its existence. Staff who were employed before 1 January 1970 retained free travel throughout the original London Transport area. This arrangement continues today, with free pass wording changed to account for bus deregulation. London Country's territory was likened to a circle around London with a hole in the middle, operating in Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent, Surrey and Sussex. The company was NBC's biggest subsidiary, starting life with 1,267 buses and coaches. The fleet was very elderly, being mainly 484 AEC Regent III RT double-deckers and 413 AEC Regal RF single-deckers, with eight Daimler Fleetlines, three Leyland Atlanteans, 209 AEC Routemasters, 14 AEC Reliances and 109 AEC Merlins.London Country Bus Services Ampyx Web World New vehicles Steps were taken to reduce the age of the fleet, and NBC quickly ordered 90 Park Royal bodied Leyland Atlanteans.London Country orders Commercial Motor 23 January 1970 page 31 In 1970/71 London Transport's last Country order, for 138 AEC Swifts, was delivered. The Atlantean soon became London Country's standard bus, and by 1980 there were 293 in the fleet. Most were bodied by Park Royal, with some by Roe to the same design and 30 Metro- Cammell bodied Atlanteans, diverted from a Midland Red order.Updating London Country buses Commercial Motor 9 July 1971 page 34 There were also 11 Leyland- engined, Godstone-based Daimler Fleetlines diverted from Western Welsh, becoming the first NBC-ordered buses in the fleet, just before the Atlanteans. The only other London Country double-deckers in the 1970s were 15 Bristol VRTs, rare highbridge Eastern Coach Works bodied examples. These were allocated to Grays garage in 1977 but were quickly moved on. There was also activity in the single-decker fleet. Some of the AEC Regal IV RFs had been refurbished in the 1960s, with twin headlights, curved windscreens, new side mouldings and improved interiors, mainly allocated to Green Line services. There were 14 Willowbrook bodied AEC Reliances at Hertford garage, which had been bought by London Transport in 1965. By 1975 they were on bus work, which some thought was idiosyncratic when vehicles twice as old were still on Green Line work. The Green Line services were largely operated by AEC Routemaster coaches and AEC Regal IV RFs. NBC ordered 90 AEC Reliances with 45-seat Park Royal bodies, which were originally in Green Line two-tone green but were quickly repainted in NBC local coach livery.A new look for the Green Line Commercial Motor 17 December 1971 page 19 For the orbital route 725 between Windsor and Gravesend, 15 Alexander W bodied AEC Swifts were purchased, but were soon demoted to Gravesend local services. Standard fleets In 1972, the Leyland National, NBC and British Leyland's joint project, became the standard in most NBC fleets. London Country bought over 500 examples, the world's largest fleet. They mainly replaced RFs, RTs and Routemasters. Some RFs were kept in areas where smaller, lighter vehicles were needed, until NBC decided on its smaller standard bus, the Bristol LH. London Country bought its first examples of the type in 1973, with more batches bought up until 1977. Throughout the 1980s NBC had had large numbers of double-deck Leyland Olympians delivered. From 1982 until 1984 these were purchased with Roe bodies, but from 1985 they had Eastern Coach Works bodies to the same style. London Country operated 75.

He was also a prominent rugby player in Montreal. Early life Born in Romania to Jewish parents, Vetra 'William' and Anna Herscovitch, he emigrated with his family to Montr√©al, Canada. He Anglicized his given name to 'Montgomery,' but was known to everyone as 'Moe.' Although short in stature at 5' 6\\", he was incredibly athletic. He played football with the Montreal Football Club of the Inter-Provincial Rugby Union until 1915 when it was disbanded due to the increasing hostilities of World War I. Service in WWI Eager to do his part in WWI, Herscovitch joined the 66th Battery, Canadian Expeditionary Forces. A gunner, while posted overseas he took up the sport of boxing, winning a number of competitions, including the Aldershot welterweight division. When he returned from the War in 1919, he played with Montreal's successor rugby team which won the division championships that year, but he also continued to box. He was selected for Canada's 1920 Olympic boxing team and assigned to its middleweight division. At Antwerp that August, he won a bronze medal, only losing to Briton Harry Mallin in the semi-final. He married Celia Goldblatt at Temple Beth Jhuda in Montreal on 18 December 1921. 1920 Summer Olympics Herscovitch competed in the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium, where he won the bronze medal in the men's middleweight event. Professional boxing career Herscovitch turned pro early the next year, and defeated Olympic gold medalist Bert Schneider on May 18, 1921. He spent the next few years fighting in Canada and New York City, putting together an inconsistent record. He beat Art Prud'homme in November 8, 1922 in a seventh- round knockout. He suffered losses as well, including his fight against world titleholder Mickey Walker on December 21, 1923 in Toronto, in which Herscovitch was billed as the Canadian welterweight champion. Walker won with a sixth round knockout, having broken his opponent's right hand during the fight. Life after boxing Herscovitch retired in the summer of 1924, and began volunteering as a boxing coach at the Montreal YMHA. Although he boxed at a time when fighters wore no protective gear, 'Moe' had never suffered a debilitating injury in the ring. However, on July 24, 1943 while on holiday at the summer resort of Plage Laval, he and some companions were set upon by a French Canadian anti-Semitic mob and beaten so badly that surgeons were forced to remove one of his eyes. He continued to be actively involved in sports and his community, and served as president of the Quebec Rugby Union. He died on July 22, 1969, and was buried at the Baron de Hirsch Cemetery in Montreal.

Appalachian Trail passing through the breezeway Originally a log structure built by a logging company, the building took its present form during the 1930s when it was rebuilt by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). It served as a restaurant and inn until 1965, when it was abandoned. Soon after, the building was rented by an artist group who used it until 1969 when it was again left vacant. By the mid-1970s the building was slated for demolition, but a group of conservation-minded locals lobbied successfully for its inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

It features a flat-twin engine with a six-speed gearbox and shaft drive. History Previous RT models, 1978 to 2005 BMW Motorrad began manufacturing RT (Reise-Tourer, or travel tourer) touring motorcycle models in the late 1970s. The first of these was air-cooled (or \\"airhead\\") models that continued BMW's long tradition dating to 1923 of producing \\"boxer\\" or opposed flat-twin engined motorcycles with unit engine-transmission construction and shaft-final-drive. In 1995, BMW produced its first air and oil-cooled (or \\"oilhead\\") RT model, the R1100RT. The new machine included standard ABS brakes, four-valve heads, five-speed gearbox, Telelever front suspension, Paralever rear suspension, and an electrically adjustable screen. In 2001, BMW launched the R1150RT, providing the same basic platform with increased engine capacity and horsepower, fully linked power-assisted ABS brakes, revised front lighting system, and a six- speed gearbox. This model was further updated in 2004 by the adoption of dual ignition, with two spark plugs per cylinder. alt=Four generations of BMW RT motorcycles 2010 R1200RT with double overhead cams 2005 to 2013 In 2005, BMW introduced the R1200RT. The design of this model was completely different from the R1150RT with a 15% boost in power, weight saving, optional electronic suspension adjustment (ESA) and on-board computer. A low seat and/or a lowered suspension were available for shorter riders reducing seat height to a lowest level of , although the lowered suspension eliminates the ESA option. The standard electrically operated windscreen was adjustable across a range of heights. The servo powered ABS brakes on the 2005 and 2006 models were partially integrated such that the rear brake pedal only applies the rear brake while the front brake lever applies both brakes. For the 2007 model year, servo assist was removed from the partially integrated brakes. A new, more advanced and lighter ABS system was produced by Continental Teves, which also produced the optional Automatic Stability Control (ASC), in BMW's traction control system for motorcycles. An electronic tire pressure monitor (TPM) was introduced as an option. During the production of the 2006 models, the original two-tone horns were replaced by a single-tone horn. Other optional equipment included cruise control, heated grips, heated seats for both the rider and passenger and a CD/Radio audio system. With and of torque, the R1200RT is suitable for long-distance touring carrying a rider and passenger and a full load of luggage; and is able to reach and do a standing quarter mile in 12.2 seconds. In November 2009, BMW announced some revisions to the R1200RT for the 2010 model year. The new model had the same horsepower, but more torque at , a higher engine speed of 8,500 rpm, and double overhead camshafts that were first used on the BMW HP2 Sport. There were some relatively minor styling changes and revisions to the screen and cockpit designs, switchgear (including conventional indicators), and location of the hydraulic fluid reservoirs. 2014 to 2018 San Marino blue 2015 R1200RT The 2014 model represented a wholesale redesign of the R1200RT. The biggest change was a shift to a water cooled version of the boxer engine, producing dyno tested and torque. BMW claimed 125 horsepower and 92 lb/ft of torque with their own testing methodology.Specifications by BMW Motorrad USA The seat and seating position, fairing, instrumentation, and frame were also updated. The standard ride modes \\"Rain\\" and \\"Road\\" can also be activated at the press of a button to adapt to weather conditions and road surfaces. An on-board computer, an electrically operated windshield, standard color-matched saddle bags, and heated grips were also basic items. Optional equipment for the 2014 RT includes semi-active electronic suspension adjustment, and BMW Dynamic ESA, which response to changing road surfaces, and a shift assistant pro that allows the rider to shift up and down without using the clutch or throttle. A central locking system locks both cases by remote control. Other options are a radio, a top case, low or high saddles, a tank bag, cruise control, and (introduced for the 2015 model) keyless ignition and locking Alpine white 2017 R1200RT The 2017 R1200RTs are fitted with a judder damper on the transmission output shaft to control rapid and forceful shaking and vibration. New features also include a revised selector drum actuator, transmission shafts, and transmission shaft bearing. As part of the Ride Modes Pro option package, ABS Pro was available, which senses a lean angle and adjusts intervention accordingly. The only changes for the 2018 model year were colors. 2019 In mid-2017 Motorrad reported that BMW was planning to soon introduce variable valve timing (VVT) on its boxer engines. In March, 2018, Bennetts announced that BMW was testing an RT with VVT, possibly a successor to the R1200RT. In September, Kevin Cameron wrote that a \\"shift cam\\" VVT system was destined for a 2019 model year R1250GS, and other media reported the technology was to be adopted on all the R series boxer motors. BMW confirmed the R1250RT would have VVT in September 2018.

BMW bikes have been popular with United Kingdom police forces in the past and many chose to return to them in 2007, taking delivery of the R1200RT after the Honda ST1300 Pan-European was withdrawn due to handling concerns. It is also used by the traffic police in Ireland. Many states and cities in the United States use the R1200RT-P for police duty, mostly in the West including by the California Highway Patrol and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Acceptance of BMW's earlier R1100RT-P and R1150RT-P models had been moderate, but in 2005 came both the introduction of the more capable R1200RT-P and the end of production of Kawasaki's economical KZ1000P police motorcycle. As a result, BMWs and Harley Davidsons have taken most of the American market, though the 2011 re-entry of Kawasaki to the public-safety field has given the RT-P a strong second rival. In the United States, more than 225 law enforcement agencies have BMW authority motorcycles in their fleets of patrol vehicles.BMW Police Motorcycles BMW claims to have produced over 80,000 motorcycles specifically for public safety use. The Authorities variant is based on the standard R1200RT but can be recognized by the addition of stainless steel protection bars (colloquially known as \\"crash bars\\") situated about the front fairing and panniers, also often used for mounting of additional equipment such as sirens. Paint and trim schemes also reflect the service use, most often black and white \\"panda paint,\\" such as found on many patrol cars. The large, flat side panels on the R1200RT-P are a convenient and easily seen location for insignia. A BMW R1200RT follows Mo Farah. Other changes include unique top-loading panniers (also known as \\"saddle boxes\\"), a single-seat (with radio box in place of the RT's pillion seat), additional switchgear for equipment, emergency lighting, and an additional auxiliary battery which feeds all public safety electrical equipment. An additional feature of the RT-P is the reprogramming of the onboard computer to allow a motor officer to lock in their current speed on the speedometer display. The officer only needs to match speed with a target vehicle, press the \\"BC\\" button on the handlebars, and the speed is visible for later reference. Optional equipment available through BMW includes electrically operated racks for mounting shotguns or rifles, as well as holders for nightsticks, flashlights, radar or lidar guns, citation books, and radio antenna mounts. Many of these items are also available from aftermarket manufacturers or may even be locally made. The standard configuration of the R1200RT-P model used in the United States uses a 100-watt siren speaker mounted on the left front protection bar, and LED lighting pods (which were specially designed for the RT-P) above the front turn signals, and on the top rear edge of the radio box, all supplied by Code 3 Public Safety Equipment. There are also mounting hardpoints for mobile radar antennas. Optional lighting which may be installed includes bright lights for illuminating a scene or to the sides, and a light mounted on a telescoping post at the right rear, which can be operated while lowered for normal use, or raised to provide omnidirectional warning while stopped (such as at an accident scene). Firefighting vehicle In July 2010, Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service in England began trialling a Firexpress fire bike version of the R1200RT fitted with twin water tanks and a hose, capable of delivering water spray or foam to extinguish fires. While not suitable for extended use‚Äîdue to the small amount of fire retardant and single firefighter carried‚Äîthe motorcycle is able to reach the scene of a fire faster than a fire truck, especially in cases such as a vehicle fire (which typically results in traffic jams which can delay fire trucks). This may reduce the spread of a fire, or even extinguish it while it is still small. In addition, the firefighter can give a report of the nature of the fire, thus enabling the agency to more rapidly task appropriate equipment. Reviews and awards The R1200RT was selected as best touring bike by two major American monthly motorcycle magazines in 2005 and 2006. In September 2006, the R1200RT was named the United Kingdom's 'number one motorcycle' by readers of RiDE magazine in its annual \\"RiDER POWER\\" survey. It repeated this achievement in 2007, reached second place overall in 2008, and won the top spot once more in 2009. In October 2006, the R1200RT was cited as a best tourer for the second year in a row by UK newspaper Motor Cycle News. The 2014 model was selected as best sport-touring bike of the year by Cycle World. Road tests published in Motorcyclist praised the 2014 model for its fine engine, \\"right-sized\\" ergonomics, and suspension \\"nearly immune to braking or accelerating influence\\". The 2014 model was the winner of the 2014 Rider magazine people's choice vote. Motorcyclist chose it in 2014 as the best touring bike for 2014. For the second year in a row, Motorcyclist magazine chose the BMW R1200RT as the 2015 \\"Best Touring Bike.\\" In its August 2015 long-term wrap-up, Paul Dean, of Cycle World, wrote \\"For riders who love to travel, enjoy having a little fun on the back roads, and often do both with a passenger, the RT could very well be the perfect motorcycle. Way, way more than just the best sport tourer.\\" Motorcycle.com selected the R1200RT as its 2015 \\"Best Sport-Tourer\\". Safety issues The R1200RT has been affected by a number of safety issues since its launch. The UK Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) has issued six separate vehicle recalls covering the front brakes, anti-lock braking system, throttle cable, and clutch.

It also has a sixth form, Carmel College Sixth Form admitting about 150 students each year. Following an OFSTED inspection in 2013, Carmel was graded as outstanding in all categories. It is part of the Bishop Hogarth Catholic Education Trust (formally Carmel Education Trust) which includes 18 schools in the Darlington region. The current principal is Mike Shorten. Admissions Carmel College is the town's only Catholic secondary school. It has four main feeder schools at Primary level. These are St Teresa's RC Primary, St Bede's RC Primary, St Augustine's RC Primary and Holy Family RC Primary. There is also another school, Abbey Road Junior School, which feeds Carmel; although this school is not Catholic, it is local to Carmel. Carmel also has a sixth form. Carmel College has eight forms which consist of C, A, R, M, E, L and J, P (from former Pope John Paul II) with three houses St. Aidans, St. Bedes and St. Cuthberts. History It began life as St Mary's Grammar School, a boys' grammar school, becoming comprehensive and co-educational in September 1974 when it merged with the Immaculate Conception Grammar School, a girls' Catholic grammar school. The modern-day \\"St. Mary's\\" building, also known as Hummersknott House, has long been rumoured to be haunted by the college ghost, Harriet. The John Caden Hall was opened by former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair in 2004, and is named after Father John Caden, who died in 2013. Carmel underwent a multimillion-pound building project, completed in 2008, which included three brand new teaching blocks and the refurbishment of many of the old facilities. Carmel also upgraded its Sixth Form facilities; expanding the common room and providing a learning resource centre in the schools library. This was carried out in Summer 2010, and opened the following school year. Tony Blair paid his last school visit as Prime Minister in 2007 at Carmel before he resigned, officially opening the brand-new \\"Newton\\" building housing the Physics, Chemistry and Biology Departments, including 8 laboratories. The campus went through a further transformation in the school year 2012/2013 involving the full reconstruction of the schools \\"Upper\\" dining hall with new classrooms placed above which were required due to the schools recent expansion to 8 \\"form\\" groups per year-groups. The new dining Hall included new flat-screen televisions and a new glass wall between the dining hall and the lower floor of the schools library. The upgrade also included the replacement of the roof on the school library and reception building and a major refurbishment of the schools Gym located near to the Music Department and the Science \\"Newton\\" Block. On 1 November 2011, Carmel RC College was officially closed, and Carmel College: A Catholic Academy was opened, as the school converted to an academy on this date. The school was named in July 2019 as a computing hub for the National Centre for Computing Education. Academic performance The GCSE exam results of 2012 were the best to date, having 100% of students getting at least 5 A*-C GCSE certificates (95% including English and Mathematics). The A-level pass rate was 99% at A2, with 52% achieving the highest grades of A*, A or B. The average point score was of 1030 points per student.http://www.carmel.org.uk Carmel College, A Catholic Academy Accreditations Carmel College is the Lead school in Carmel Teacher Training Partnership, an accredited ITT provider, training teachers for Qualified Teacher Status QTS in both primary and secondary schools through SCITT and [School Direct].

J. Critchlow, IBM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LABORATORY, San Jose, California, February 6, 1953 After considering technologies such as wire matrices, rod arrays, drums, drum arrays, etc., the engineers at IBM's San Jose California laboratory invented the hard disk drive. The disk drive created a new level in the computer data hierarchy, then termed Random Access Storage but today known as secondary storage, less expensive and slower than main memory (then typically drums and later core memory) but faster and more expensive than tape drives.The IBM 350 RAMAC Disk File, ASME Award, February 27, 1984. The commercial usage of hard disk drives (HDD) began in 1957, with the shipment of a production IBM 305 RAMAC system including IBM Model 350 disk storage. US Patent 3,503,060 issued March 24, 1970, and arising from the IBM RAMAC program is generally considered to be the fundamental patent for disk drives.Disk Drive Patent Each generation of disk drives replaced larger, more sensitive and more cumbersome devices. The earliest drives were usable only in the protected environment of a data center. Later generations progressively reached factories, offices and homes, eventually becoming ubiquitous. Disk media diameter was initially 24 inches in diameter, but over time it has been reduced to today's 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch standard sizes. Drives with the larger 24-inch- and 14-inch-diameter media were typically mounted in standalone boxes (resembling washing machines) or large equipment rack enclosures. Individual drives often required high- current AC power due to the large motors required to spin the large disks. Drives with smaller media generally conformed to de facto standard form factors. The capacity of hard drives has grown exponentially over time. When hard drives became available for personal computers, they offered 5-megabyte capacity. During the mid-1990s the typical hard disk drive for a PC had a capacity of about 1 gigabyte.1996 Disk Trend Report ‚Äì Rigid Disk Drives, Figure 2 ‚Äì Unit Shipment Summary , desktop hard disk drives typically had a capacity of 1 to 8 terabytes, with the largest-capacity drives reaching 20 terabytes (single-disk drives, \\"dual\\" drives are available up to 24 TB). Smaller, laptop internal 2.5-inch drives, are available up to 5 TB. Unit production peaked in 2010 at about 650 million units and has been in a slow decline since then. 1950s‚Äì1970s The IBM 350 Disk File was developed under the code-name RAMAC by an IBM San Jose team led by Reynold Johnson. It was announced in 1956 with the then new IBM 305 RAMAC computer.\\"NEW PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT- IBM 305 RAMAC,\\" IBM Announcement Letter 256-114, September 4, 1956 A variant, the IBM 355 Disk File, was simultaneously announced with the IBM RAM 650 computer,\\"NEW PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT- RAM 650,\\" IBM Announcement Letter 256-117, September 4, 1956 an enhancement to the IBM 650. The IBM 350 drive had fifty platters, with a total capacity of five million 6-bit characters (3.75 megabytes). A single head assembly having two heads was used for access to all the platters, yielding an average access time of just under 1 second. The RAMAC disk drive created a new level in the computer data hierarchy, today known as secondary storage, less expensive and slower than main memory (then typically core or drum) but faster and more expensive than tape drives. Subsequently there was a period of about 20 years in which other technologies competed with disks in the secondary storage marketplace, for example tape strips, e.g., NCR CRAM, tape cartridges, e.g., IBM 3850, and drums, e.g., Burroughs B430, UNIVAC FASTRAND, but all ultimately were displaced by HDDs. Today SSDs compete with HDDs in the marketplace. The IBM 1301 Disk Storage Unit, announced in 1961, introduced the usage of heads having self-acting air bearings (self-flying heads) with one head per each surface of the disks. It was followed in 1963 by the IBM 1302, with 4 times the capacity. Also in 1961, Bryant Computer Products introduced its 4000 series disk drives. These massive units stood tall, long, and wide, and had up to 26 platters, each in diameter, rotating at up to 1,200 rpm. Access times were from 50 to 205 milliseconds (ms). The drive's total capacity, depending on the number of platters installed, was up to 205,377,600 bytes (205 MB). The first disk drive to use removable media was the IBM 1311 drive. It was introduced in 1962 using the IBM 1316 disk pack to store two million characters. It was followed by the IBM 2311 (1964) using the IBM 1316 disk pack to store 5 megabyte, IBM 2314 (1965) using the IBM 2316 disk pack to store 29 megabytes, the IBM 3330 using 3336 disk packs to store 100 megabytes and the 3330-11 using the 3336-11 to store 200 megabytes.A partially disassembled IBM 350 (RAMAC)Memorex in 1968 shipped the first HDD, the Memorex 630, plug compatible to an IBM model 2311 marking the beginning of independent competition (Plug Compatible Manufacturers or PCMs) for HDDs attached to IBM systems. It was followed in 1969 by the Memorex 660, an IBM 2314 compatible, which was OEM'ed to DEC and resold as the RP02.Removable disk packs In 1964, Burroughs introduced the B-475 disk drive, with a head per track, as part of the B5500.Burroughs B-475 Disk Drive (circled) In 1970, IBM introduced the 2305 disk drive, with a head per track. In 1973, IBM introduced the IBM 3340 \\"Winchester\\" disk drive and the 3348 data module, the first significant commercial use of low mass and low load heads with lubricated platters and the last IBM disk drive with removable media. This technology and its derivatives remained the standard through 2011. Project head Kenneth Haughton named it after the Winchester 30-30 rifle because it was planned to have two 30 MB spindles; however, the actual product shipped with two spindles for data modules of either 35 MB or 70 MB. The name 'Winchester' and some derivatives are still common in some non-English speaking countries to generally refer to any hard disks (e.g. Hungary, Russia). Also in 1973, Control Data Corporation introduced the first of its series of SMD disk drives using conventional disk pack technology. The SMD family became the predominant disk drive in the minicomputer market into the 1980s. Smaller diameter media came into usage during the 1970s and by the end of the decade standard form factors had been established for drives using nominally 8-inch media (e.g., Shugart SA1000) and nominally 5.25-inch media (e.g., Seagate ST-506). During the 1970s, captive production, dominated by IBM's production for its own use, remained the largest revenue channel for HDDs, though the relative importance of the OEM channel grew. Led by Control Data, Diablo Systems, CalComp and Memorex, the OEM segment reached $631 million in 1979, but still well below the $2.8 billion associated with captive production.Storage Industry Dynamics And Strategy 1980s, the transition to the PC era The 1980s saw the minicomputer age plateau as PCs were introduced. Manufacturers such as DEC and Hewlett-Packard continued to manufacture minicomputer compatible hard drive systems as industry demanded higher storage. Hewlett-Packard introduced the HP 7935 as one such drive. But it was clear that smaller Winchester storage systems were eclipsing large platter hard drives. Seagate 20 MB HDD and Western Digital Controller for PC Hard disk drives for personal computers (PCs) were initially a rare and very expensive optional feature; systems typically had only the less expensive floppy disk drives or even cassette tape drives as both secondary storage and transport media. However by the late '80s, hard disk drives were standard on all but the cheapest PC and floppy disks were used almost solely as transport media. Most hard disk drives in the early 1980s were sold to PC end users by systems integrators such as the Corvus Disk System or the systems manufacturer such as the Apple ProFile. The IBM PC XT in 1983, included an internal standard 10 MB hard disk drive, and soon thereafter internal hard disk drives proliferated on personal computers, one popular type was the ST506/ST412 hard drive and MFM interface. HDDs continued to get smaller with the introduction of the 3.5-inch form factor in the middle of the decade Rodime 1983 and the 2.5-inch form factor PrairieTek 1988. Industry participation peaked with about 75 active manufacturers in 1985 and then declined thereafter even though volume continued to climb: by 1989 reaching 22 million units and US$23 billion in revenue.Disk/Trend Report - Rigid Disk Drives, October 1989 1990s Even though there were a number of new entrants, industry participants continued to decline in total to 15 in 1999. Unit volume and industry revenue monotonically increased during the 1990s to 174 million units and $26 billion.Gartner/Dataquest, Market Share and Forecast: Hard Disk Drives, Worldwide, 2001-2010, Chapter 2, (c) 2006 The industry production consolidated around the 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch form factors; the larger form factors dying off while several smaller form factors were offered but achieved limited success, e.g. HP 1.3-inch Kittyhawk, IBM 1-inch Microdrive, etc. 2000 to present A 2TB Hard drive from 2011 with built in SATA interface In 2001 the HDD industry experienced its first ever decline in units and revenue. The number of industry participants decreased to 6 in 2009 and to 3 in 2013. Unit production peaked in 2010 at about 650 million units. Unit shipment has been in a slow decline since then, shipping about 276 million units in 2018 with a somewhat slower decline projected thereafter. As of August 2020, the largest hard drive is 20 TB (while SSDs can be much bigger, 100 TB, however mainstream consumer 8 TB). Smaller, laptop internal 2.5-inch drives, are available up to 5 TB.

The industry grew slowly at first with three additional companies in the market by 1964, Anelex Corp., Bryant Computer Products and Data Products Corp. The industry grew rapidly in the late 1960s and again in the 1980s reaching a peak of 75 manufacturers in 1984. There have been at least 221 companies manufacturing hard disk drives \\\\- lists 126 HDD manufacturers including 3 current ones. but most of that industry has vanished through bankruptcy or mergers and acquisitions. Surviving manufacturers are Seagate, Toshiba and Western Digital (WD) with Toshiba as the senior participant having entered the market in 1977, twenty years after IBM started the market. From beginning and into the early 1980s manufacturing was mainly by US firms in the United States at locations such as Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, Minnesota and Oklahoma City. In the 1980s US firms, beginning with Seagate, began to shift production to Singapore and then other locations in southeast Asia. In a span of seven years, 1983 to 1990, Singapore became the single largest location of HDD production, amounting to 55% of worldwide production. Japanese HDD companies later also moved their production to southeast Asia. Today the three remaining firms all produce their units in the Pacific Rim. By the 1990s the dollar value of magnetic recording devices produced by companies located in California's \\"Silicon Valley\\" exceeded the dollar value of semiconductor devices produced there leading some to suggest that a more appropriate name for this area would be \\"Iron Oxide Valley,\\" after the magnetic material coating the disks. All three remaining firms still have significant activities in Silicon Valley, but no HDD manufacturing. Western Digital still manufactures its read-write head wafers in Fremont CA.

A dark and tragic romantic tale about young love, drugs, a cross country trip and Tourette syndrome. Filmed locations were New Paltz, Highland and Poughkeepsie in upstate New York, as well as Niagara Falls and Canada. A film was produced by the New York City based Shooting Gallery. The film was praised internationally, particularly in the UK, but American critics were mixed. Robin Tunney's performance garnered her the Volpi Cup Award for Best Actress at the 1997 Venice International Film Festival. The film has fallen into a cult status, due to underground popularity. It was released only on VHS, but not on DVD. Plot The film begins with Seth and Marcie shoplifting times from a dollar type store. The two crooks crash into each other and soon a friendship ensues. After giving Marcie a ride to her weekend job, Seth goes home to his abusive and somewhat mentally unstable father. The next day Seth is at a different store where he runs into Marcie. After driving over to her home and picking up some of Marcie‚Äôs personal items, they begin a drive north to Canada in pursuit of a black Barbie styling head for Marcie. On their drive north, Marcie is unable to hide her tics. At one point, she has an outburst in a parking lot and attacks a guy who was shouting insults to Seth. From this point on, the only things that keep her tics and behaviors at bay are sex and alcohol. In desperation to get her hands on an antipsychotic, they attempt to rob a pharmacy. The pharmacist catches them and shoots Seth in the leg with a shot gun. The two get away, but one of the car tires is hit in the process and eventually Marcie crashes the car. An old man named Walter tows their truck to his place and helps take care of Seth‚Äôs wound. Over the course of a week, he teaches the two how to shoot and catch fish. After a local deputy comes by asking Walter if he‚Äôd seen the pair, Marcie has a severe outburst and beats Walter. Seth and Marcie take off in Walter‚Äôs truck. The pair make it to Canada and find the Barbie head. The only available black Barbie head is a display model that the store manager refuses to sell. Marcie again has a violent outburst and the cops are called. When the police arrive, she grabs the gun from one police officer and the other surprises her from a side aisle and shoots her dead. Seth is arrested. Later, we see Walter reading an apologies letter with $20 from Seth. Seth narrates the happy ending that did not happen, as Walter reads his letter.

Providing current \\"Year-ending\\" results, as well as \\"Year- Ending\\" results for one or more past years as of the same date, allows owners, managers, investors, and other stakeholders to compare the company's current performance to past periods and annual figures. Related terms In contrast to Year-To-Date, the Year-Ending summaries give a better understanding performance by including the seasonal performance. For example, a sales figure for \\"Year Ending July 2006\\" would include the holiday sales from December 2005, while extrapolating from a July Year-To-Date sales figure would underestimate annual sales. In contrast to Year-on-Year or Year Over Year figures, which compare similar periods during other years, (for example December 2004 to December 2005), Year-ending is less volatile and are directly comparable to annual figures.

Known as Phase I, it was completed in 2001 and included a bridge over Cane Run. Phase II extends southwest from the Norfolk Southern Railway to US 421 (Leestown Road) at Alexandria Drive and includes a span over the railroad. The highway west of Newtown Pike was constructed by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. An extension east of KY 922 (Newtown Pike) was not originally planned. However, Newtown Springs, a new development project taking place east of KY 922 and the eastern terminus of Citation Boulevard, incorporated an extension of the route east towards KY 353 (Russell Cave Road). It is being constructed as a two-lane road with curbs and sidewalks. Citation Boulevard was originally named Secretariat Boulevard after Secretariat, a famous race horse. The title, however, was disapproved by its owner, so Citation was chosen out of a draw at the Kentucky Horse Park. Citation, a bay colt bred at the Calumet Farm, won the 1948 Triple Crown and raced for seven years; it was also the first horse to earn $1 million. Citation Boulevard Extension Completed in September 2015, Citation Boulevard was extended from Jaggie Fox Way to Leestown Rd. connecting with a re-routed Alexandria Drive. Days after the opening of the Citation Boulevard there were multiple wrecks at the Greendale intersection. It was criticized that drivers crossing or turning left off of Citation, turning left going northbound or turning right going southbound could not see other drivers coming over the railroad overpass. In less than 2 days the KYTC released a statement that a traffic light would be installed at that intersection.

The book is derived from Raymond's dissertation, which was produced under the supervision of the feminist theologian Mary Daly. Summary Raymond investigates the role of transsexualism in society ‚Äì particularly psychological and surgical approaches to it ‚Äì and argues that transsexualism reinforces traditional gender stereotypes. Raymond also writes about the ways in which the medical-psychiatric complex is medicalizing gender identity and the social and political context that has helped spawn transsexual treatment and surgery as normal and therapeutic medicine. Raymond maintains that transsexualism is based on the \\"patriarchal myths\\" of \\"male mothering\\", and \\"making of woman according to man's image\\". She claims this is done in order \\"to colonize feminist identification, culture, politics and sexuality\\", adding: \\"All transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves .... Transsexuals merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women, so that they seem non-invasive.\\"Raymond, Janice. (1994). The Transsexual Empire, p. 104 Publication history In 1979, the first edition of The Transsexual Empire was published by Beacon Press, a nonprofit publisher in Boston run by the Unitarian Universalist Association.

The Transsexual Empire, p. iv In 1994, a second edition was published by Teachers College Press.Raymond, Janice. (1994). The Transsexual Empire, pp. iv, xiii Reception At time of publishing, The Transsexual Empire was respected and admired in mainstream media, with psychiatrist Thomas Szasz commenting that \\"[it] has rightly seized on transsexualism as an emblem of modern society‚Äôs unremitting‚Äîthough increasingly concealed‚Äîantifeminism.\\" In a 1980 review, the philosopher Sarah Hoagland called it a \\"fecund discussion of patriarchal deception\\". However, that interpretation has since gone out of vogue. Raymond's views on transsexuality have been criticized by many in the LGBT and feminist communities as extremely transphobic, and constituting hate-speech against trans men and women.Rose, Katrina C.

Requena, Valencia, Spain ‚Äì d. November 16, 1720, Lima) was a Spanish colonial official in Peru. He was president of the Audiencia of Quito from 1691 to 1699. (Quito was then part of the Viceroyalty of Peru.) From March 2 to August 15, 1716 he served as interim viceroy of Peru. Early career Mateo de la Mata was born in Requena in eastern Spain. His parents were Mateo de Cuenca Mata and Isabel Ponce de Le√≥n Iranz√∫. He studied at San Ildefonso de Alcal√° for eight years. He earned a bachelor's degree in canon law from the University of Salamanca and a licentiate from the University of Osuna. He was a knight of the military Order of Calatrava. He was an oidor (judge) in the Audiencia of Santa Fe de Bogot√° (also part of the Viceroyalty of Peru), beginning in August 1674. On October 31, 1680 he was promoted to criminal alcalde in Lima. During this time he married Luisa de C√©spedes, a native of Lima and daughter of Juan Antonio de C√©spedes y Toledo, knight of the Order of Santiago, and Mar√≠a de Arcos y Aguilar, a native of Lima. From January 26, 1687 he was an oidor in the Audiencia of Lima. As president of the Audiencia of Quito Mata Ponce de Le√≥n was named president of the Audiencia of Quito by a decree dated October 27, 1689, but he did not occupy the position until January 10, 1691. He governed until 1699. By this point he was a lawyer and oidor in Lima, with much experience in public administration. As was the custom in the Audiencia of Quito, for the first two years of his administration he was also visitador general (inspector). When Mata assumed the presidency in Quito, nearly all the buccaneers had abandoned the Pacific. Nevertheless, he had to address the continuing effects of nearly a decade of earlier, devastating pirate attacks. He assumed the responsibility of building the new city of Guayaquil. In 1693 he sent the oidor Crist√≥bal de Cevallos y Borja to supervise the design and construction of Guayaquil. The corregidor of Guayaquil, Fernando Ponce de Le√≥n, died in 1694 and Mata named Oidor Cevallos to fill the position on an interim basis pending the arrival of a new corregidor with an appointment from the king. In 1696 Mata traveled personally to Guayaquil to inspect and supervise the work there. During his government the institutions of the Audiencia were strengthened and the economic situation improved. On the other hand, there was a series of great natural catastrophes, such as the 1692 earthquake at Latacunga, in which 8,000 of the 22,000 inhabitants perished. In 1693 a plague struck Quito and the towns of the Andean highlands. Mata took care that the sick were aided and medicines distributed, applying some of his own money to the purpose. There was also a severe drought during the last seven years of the seventeenth century. Finally, on June 20, 1698, another earthquake destroyed what little of Latacunga had been reconstructed, and also badly affected Ambato and Riobamba. There were a great many deaths. Mata went to the affected towns to aid in the relief. Later career In 1699, after his term as president of the Audiencia of Quito, he again became oidor in Lima. Thereafter the king offered to promote him to a place in the Council of the Indies as a reward for his services, but Mata preferred to remain in the administration in Lima. In 1716 Viceroy Diego Ladr√≥n de Guevara, who had been bishop of Quito, was removed as viceroy. Mata, in virtue of his position as deacon of the Audiencia of Lima, was named interim governor and captain general of the Viceroyalty of Peru. He occupied this position from March 2, 1716 to August 15 of the same year. He died in Lima on November 16, 1720.

Historically part of Perthshire, it was formerly incorporated as part of the city of Dundee, but is now administered as part of Perth and Kinross. History The old parish church, a roofless 16th century building currently in poor condition, survives on a mound in the old kirkyard, by the Gowrie Burn. This site was formerly close to the sea; much land has been reclaimed from the Firth of Tay in recent times, and it is now some way inland. This was an early Christian site, dedicated to St Curet√°n. An artistically important and well-preserved cross-slab carved on five faces from this site is on display in the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. Dating from the early 9th century, the front shows a cross decorated with interlace, the back three stylised clerics, one holding an object which may be a charter with appended seal, above two dragon-like creatures. This cross-slab was formerly built into a window of the medieval church, along with another smaller, damaged example, also now in Edinburgh (not on display). The village was formerly part of the estate of Mylnefield. The quarry at Invergowrie supplied important sites around the UK, stone being included in the base of Nelson's column and St Katherine's Docks in London. The quarry workers hit a spring at the beginning of the 20th century and the quarry filled with water. The former quarry can be seen as you leave Invergowrie station by train heading to Perth and now looks like a large lake. Until 1967, the main source of work in the village was a paper mill. The legend of the Gows o' Gowrie, stones supposed thrown by the devil around Invergowrie. The prophecy comes from a verse by Thomas the Rhymer (circa 1280). > \\"When the Yowes o' Gowrie come to land, > The Day o' Judgement's near at hand\\" Invergowrie churches: the nearer square tower belongs to the Church of Scotland Parish Church of Invergowrie and the rear spire is the Scottish Episcopal Church of Invergowrie Where the stones are, if they exist, has not been quite agreed. There is a \\"Deil's stone\\" at Greystanes, behind the Hilton hotel, surrounded by a Victorian fence. There is also a lump of rock which used to be called \\"the Paddock Stone\\" or the \\"Fairy Stone\\" in the wood situated on the Waterside road, near the quarry. It was said another stone was left in Invergowrie Bay, but that is now covered in silt and not visible. The Parish of Longforgan, by Adam Phillips, contains several paragraphs on the subject. The stones are of course glacial deposits. There was also the large Victorian house called \\"The Gows\\", now part of the Invergowrie Technology Park. On 22 October 1979 a rail crash occurred after a warning signal was ignored resulting in the death of five people and 50 injuries. Geography Invergowrie is located on the northwest bank of the Firth of Tay, with the Invergowrie Bay located just to the east and south of the village. Climate The Mylnefield weather station was owned by the Met Office and is located in Invergowrie. Transport Invergowrie railway station serves the village, but only a few services stop there. The station is situated on the Glasgow to Aberdeen Line. Frequent bus services connect Invergowrie to Dundee, Perth and Fife. Stagecoach Strathtay operate services to Perth, Dundee City Centre and Kirkcaldy Dundee Airport is situated east of the village, providing flights to London City and Belfast City Airports. The A85 road runs to the northeast of Invergowrie, while the A90 road runs to the north and northwest of the village.

Early life Chen Jiongming was born in 1878 at Haifeng, Guangdong, China as Chen Jie. He was born into a landlord family of moderate wealth and sent to study the Confucian classics in a private school by his grandfather at the age of 5, having been raised by him since his father died in 1881. His grandfather died in 1882, leaving the Chen family with declining wealth. He received the literary degree of Xiucai in 1899, adopting the name Jiongming (\\"To Illuminate Brightly\\"), and later the courtesy name Jingcun (\\"To Compete for Survival\\"). He married Huang Yun, the daughter of the principal of the school he attended, birthing eight children, five of which were daughters - Buoyao, Biyao, Ruiyao, Shuyao, and Weiyao, and three of which were sons - Dingxia, Dingyan, and Dingbing. In 1904, Chen attended the Haifeng Normal School to train to become a schoolteacher, graduating and applying for a teaching position at the advanced primary school in Haifeng in 1905. He was initially supposed to be the principal, but was banned from joining for his revolutionary ideas. He occasionally went to Huizhou to tutor wealthy students for the district examination.Yuan 1985, 45-46 In early 1906, he unsuccessfully tried to create a private normal school for training teachers.NP 1957, 10 When that plan failed, he attended the Academy of Law and Political Science in Guangzhou, which he graduated from in August 1908. Early revolutionary During his time at the Academy of Law and Political Science, Chen and his friends often used their vacations to return to Haifeng and promote their Self-Government Association (Zizhihui), trying to eradicate opium smoking, improving local grain depots, and creating nurseries for children.NP 1957, 12 As the East River region was becoming more disorderly, the Governor-General (Zongdu) in Guangzhou gave the magistrate in Huizhou the power to execute prisoners without trial at the scene of the crime, leading to the arrest and execution of everyone in sight when the magistrate heard of a disturbance, once arresting a 13-year-old boy, of which his release was appealed successfully, but to no avail as the villagers discovered he had been executed the day before the appeal went through.NP 1957, 11 Due to this misconduct, the local gentry pleaded to remove the magistrate, but the position of lead petitioner was not taken up by anyone initially, due to the risk of execution if the Governor-General proved the accusations to be false. Therefore, Chen was asked to take up the position for a reward of 1000 US Dollars. He replied, saying that he would first look into the matter himself. He collected evidence and interviewed witnesses, and went to Guangzhou to confront the Governor-General, successfully defending the petition and impeaching the magistrate, later donating his monetary reward at the Huizhou Fraternal Association in Guangzhou, explaining that he would not have done it for money as he was a citizen from the East River region.Yuan 1985, 46 Thus, Chen gained a reputation for his leadership and his refusal to benefit financially in Guangzhou. During his vacation from the Academy in February 1908, at the shrine to Wen Tianxiang in Haifeng, Chen persuaded over 30 men to swear their support for the National Revolution.NP 1957, 11 Many of them (also named Chen, but not related) stayed his acolytes throughout his political career. Chen's new group was made up of \\"village intellectuals\\". None of them were foreign- educated or members of secret societies. For this group, revolution was not a means to an end to the Manchu, but to the daily suffering and injustice they experienced. Chen Jiongming returned home from the Academy in 1908, establishing the Haifeng Self-Government Gazette (Haifeng Zizhibao) in early 1909, where he was the editor-in-chief.NP 1957, 12 Before Chen's gazette, the people of Haifeng were already readers of revolutionary literature. According to Chen Qiyou, \\"Secret revolutionary literature, such as Zou Rong's The Revolutionary Army, was read widely among young intellectuals\\".Chen 1963, 36 Guangdong Provincial Assembly In 1909, 94 members were elected to the Guangdong Provincial Assembly, three of which represented Manchu bannermen. The number of assemblymen from each prefecture varied greatly - there were only 36 for Guangzhou Fu and only 6 for Huizhou Fu.Huazi ribao, August 14, 1909 The minimum age to join was 30, and Chen Jiongming, who was barely above the limit, was one of the people elected to the assembly to represent Huizhou.Chang 1983, 302-6 The first annual session of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly was called on October 14th, 1909 but delayed by 10 days. Chen Jiongming was elected Resident Member by 53 votes.Huazi ribao, October 21, 1909 Chen Jiongming was one of the only progressives in the conservative- dominated assembly. He was elected to chair the Committee of Legal Matters. Chen introduced 6 of the 25 bills the Assembly passed during its first session. He submitted a proposal about gambling, stating in his speech that:Huazi ribao, November 10, 1909 Chen also supported a bill to expropriate funds from family and clan estates. However, when the matter was left to the gentry to decide, Chen protested, saying that from experience, the gentry would do nothing, and some sort of government intervention would be preferred.Huazi ribao, November 12, 24, 25, 1909 In the third meeting, Chen proposed a bill to abolish the Bureau of Rehabilitation, which was passed by the Assembly but rejected by the Governor-General in Guangzhou.Huazi ribao, November 15, 1909 In the fifth meeting, Chen again spoke against gambling and, on the subject with the border dispute with Macau, urged the Assembly to petition the Governor-General to talk to Beijing and set a course to negotiate with Portugal.Huazi ribao, November 18, 1909) During the ninth meeting, Chen expressed his opinion that the Assembly should not be subordinate to the Governor-General.Huazi ribao, November 30, 1909 He also proposed the elimination of the articles in the penal code that allowed local authorities to execute criminals without trial at the scene of the crime, something he stressed greatly due to his previous experiences with the village magistrate. With only 21 votes in favor, Chen's proposal was rejected. Chen introduced a bill to inaugurate schools for girls and another that required the election of the board of directors of educational institutions, instead of being appointed by the government. A month after the creation of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly, the Jiangsu Assembly created the Union of Provincial Assemblies to urge Beijing to accelerate the constitutional program. Three delegates from each province were sent to Shanghai, which in February 1910 went to Beijing to call for the inauguration of a national parliament within one year.Huang 1955, 542Chang 1983, 63-77Rhoads 1975, 163 Chen Jiongming was one of the delegates representing Guangdong, along with another progressive, Qiu Fengjia.

By then, he was already back in Guangzhou, committed to a revolutionary uprising that had been planned to begin on February 12th.Feng 1974, 155-56 First attempts at revolution Chen Jiongming may have joined the Tongmenghui between 1906 and 1908, inspired by his Japanese-educated instructor at the Academy, Zhu Zhixin, but another source states that he joined the organization in 1909 at the meeting of the Union of Provincial Assemblies in Shanghai.NP 1957, 13 The Canton New Army, measuring around 7,000 men, had prepared a coup that was to be launched on February 12th, 1910, during Chinese New Year celebrations. Zhang Lucun, a participant in secret meetings of the coup planning, recalls:Zhang Lucun 1981, 24 Had the coup succeeded, Chen Jiongming would have become the Deputy Chief of Guangdong, with his fellow Assemblyman Qiu Fengjia as Chief Executive. However, authorities had become aware of the coup around 3 months before it was to happenHuazi ribao, March 3, 1910 and put Canton under martial law. Chen Jiongming's village comrades and revolutionaries gathered at his house to receive arms and ammunition, but the fierce gunfight that ensued on the way to the Big East Gate killed leaders on both sides.Zhang Lucun 1981, 26Huazi ribao, March 12, 1910Chen 1981, 35-37 On February 9, when the first clashes were starting, Chen Jiongming told the revolutionaries in Haifeng to send his mother to Hong Kong for safety and to alert East River revolutionaries. After one of the leaders of the revolutionary army, Ni Yingdian, was killed in battle, Chen Jiongming secretly left to Hong Kong.NP 1957, 13 While in Hong Kong in February 1910, Chen Jiongming and 10 others organized the Chinese Assassination Corps with Liu Shifu. Chen was one of the Corps' members that were involved both in the Corp and in the Tongmenghui. All 12 members of the corps swore secrecy and comradeship. Even though Chen Jiongming's involvement in revolutionary activities were revealed to Manchu authorities, he continued his activities as a member of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly. When Chen returned to Canton in May 1910, the Assembly was in hot debate over the Canton-Hankou Railway Company. The Assembly appointed Chen and 5 others to form a special committee to draft new by-laws by June 1. During a meeting with representatives of interested organizations on the next day, Chen reminded the members that the by-laws would have to receive shareholder approval, and that a shareholder meeting was scheduled for September.Huazi ribao, May 30, June 3, 1910 During the same Assembly session, Chen Jiongming was asked to draft an impeachment document for appointed officials. On October 3, 1910, Chen attended the second annual Assembly session. During the session, Chen initiated the investigation for a magistrate in Haifeng. According to Huazi Ribao, Chen was skeptical about the Assembly's plan to push for the early inauguration of the national parliament. Chen agreed with another Assemblyman that he would support the proposal only to \\"ride with the tide\\", as he was already committed to a revolution instead of reform.Huazi ribao October 29, 1910 The Assembly also discussed Chen's anti-gambling proposals he had made at the last annual session in 1909. Chen made a new proposal to the assembly in the second annual session, where he would revamp the salt revenue administration and use salt revenues to replace the revenue lost by gambling, filling the revenue gap. He proposed: In order to preserve free-market competition, Chen suggested for the division of salt-producing districts in Guangdong into monopolized \\"selling\\" districts, designating a number of merchants as those who would be allowed to trade freely, and implementing regulations for salt merchants. The Assembly once again requested the Governor-General to petition Beijing for Chen's gambling proposal, but he declined. The Assembly voted on October 17 to adjourn in protest, with telegrams explaining their position sent to authorities and prominent Cantonese in Beijing and other provincial assemblies.Huazi ribao, October 18, 19, 21, 22, 1910 After 9 days, the Governor-General finally agreed to bring the issue to Beijing. Later on, an issue started over the full suppression of gambling. Fully aware that he would lose the vote as many assemblymen were bribed by gambling companies, Chen put it to a written vote, which lost. Chen then turned this around and exposed the bribed assemblymen, with the 35 assemblymen who voted against the proposal forced to resign. Newly-appointed Governor-General Zhang Mingqi agreed to the proposal and promised to implement it on March 30th, 1911. In December 1910, the assemblymen who were exposed and forced to resign from their positions started 2 newspapers, criticizing and responding to Chen. The assemblymen who voted for the proposal made a newspaper in response, known as Ke Bao (Assent), in a reference to their votes on the proposal. Its first issue appeared on March 30th, 1911, on the same day the proposed changes were supposed to be implemented. However, the newspaper was quickly closed down on April 23rd, as authorities in Guangzhou accused content in it of being \\"derogatory toward the Throne and so inflammatory as to disturb the peace and tranquility of the nation\\".Huazi ribao, April 25, 1911 Xinhai Revolution On April 13th, 1911, the special assembly session called by Governor-General Zhang Mingqi on March 22nd, 1911, was closed. General Fu Qi had been assassinated, and Guangzhou was put under martial law. The South China branch office of the Tongmenghui decided to start their uprising in Spring 1911, with a force of 800 revolutionaries. An Overall Planning Bureau was put in Hong Kong to direct the uprising. Huang Xing was made Bureau Chief, Zhao Sheng was made deputy chief, Hu Hanmin was in charge of the secretariat, and Chen Jiongming was responsible for organization. Overseas Chinese raised 190,000 Hong Kong Dollars to support the uprising. By early 1911, Chen Jiongming was funneling his fellow revolutionaries from the East River district into Guangzhou. Chen's residence on Sihou street was their headquarters, the Siping School and the Ke Bao office were their munitions depots, Chen's quarters at the Provincial Assembly were used as an explosives depot, and Chen Dasheng's house was used as a staging point for setting fire to the Manchu quarters.Cao 1970, 283 Political career Trained as a lawyer at the Academy of Law and Political Science, he became a Qing legislator, a republican revolutionary, a military leader, a civil administrator and a federalist who sought to reconstruct China as a democratic republic. He obtained the post of commander-in-chief of the Guangdong Army. He became military governor of Guangdong three times (1911‚Äì1912, 1913, 1920‚Äì1923) and civil governor of Guangdong from 1920‚Äì1922 and military governor of Guangxi from 1921‚Äì1922. Chen was instrumental in backing Sun Yat-sen's Constitutional Protection Movement. He also restored Sun to power after the Guangdong-Guangxi War. Chen disagreed with Sun about the direction that reform should take‚ÄîSun wanted to unite the country by force and institute change through a centralized government based on a one-party system, while Chen advocated multiparty federalism with Guangdong becoming the model province and the peaceful unification of China. Sun became suspicious that the federalist movement was being exploited by the warlords to justify their military fiefdoms. Relations deteriorated further when Sun became \\"extraordinary president\\", a move not condoned by the Provisional Constitution. It was Chen who first invited the Chinese Communist Party to Guangdong against Sun's objection that the Communists might dilute the movement. After the First Zhili-Fengtian War in 1922 there was a strong movement to reunite the northern and southern governments by having both Sun and Xu Shichang resign their rival presidencies in favor of restoring Li Yuanhong as president of a united republic. Chen was enthusiastic but Sun felt the new government would be a powerless puppet of the Zhili clique. Sun Yat-sen and Chen Jiongming soon split over the continuation of the Northern Expedition. Sun conceived it to have begun with the occupation of Guangxi. From there he wished Chen to push into Hunan. After Wu Peifu of the Zhili clique in Beijing recognized his power in the south, Chen abandoned Sun. Unexpectedly revolting against the Kuomintang militarily in 1922, Chen led his forces to attack Sun's residence as well as office. Sun was forced to escape on HMS Moorhen and delay his Northern Expedition. Tomb of Chen Jiongming at Mount Ziwei, Huizhou, Guangdong. With the help of Tang Jiyao, the KMT retook Guangzhou in 1923. Chen fled to Huizhou in eastern Guangdong after Sun's army defeated him. From 1923‚Äì1925 the Guangdong government organized two eastern campaigns against him and he fled to Hong Kong, as his remaining forces were completely wiped out in 1925. He became an ally of Tang Jiyao, after Tang was expelled from the KMT following the Yunnan-Guangxi War. He was elected premier of the China Public Interest Party with Tang as his deputy. From Hong Kong he criticized the Nationalists' single-party system and continued to advocate multiparty federalism. After the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, he attacked Chiang Kai- shek's regime for its refusal to confront Japan and he organized boycotts of Japanese products. He died of typhus on September 22, 1933.  Legacy  Chen has somewhat of a mixed legacy but most would agree that he contributed in some significant way to the establishment of modern China. On one hand in some mainland and Taiwanese textbooks, Chen is considered a traitor and reactionary warlord by both the Kuomintang and the CCP for his rebellion against Sun in 1922. Sun's party quickly began to publish propaganda about Chen to discredit him. The Communists, who had entered into an alliance with Sun and who still regard him as the founding hero of the Chinese Revolution, have continued to characterize Chen as a counter-revolutionary. On the other hand, his party defended him as a true revolutionary and democrat by pointing out the tragedies, misgovernance and corruption caused by centralized, one-party dictatorship. After the China Public Interest Party formed a united front with the Communists in 1947, Chen's role has been obscured to the point of invisibility in the party's official history. Other than his family, his most vocal apologist was Chinese writer Li Ao.

Scouting makes it possible for the young men and women to learn more about their Hungarian heritage, language and culture. The organization is dedicated to carrying out its obligations at four levels: God, their adopted countries, their fellow man and the Hungarian nation. The Boy Scout and Girl Scout units meet in conjunction with Hungarian weekend schools, which in many instances they also operate. History At the end of World War II in 1945 and during subsequent years, Scout groups were organized by Hungarian refugees in Austria and Germany. As a young Scoutmaster during 1945, G√°bor Bodn√°r (b. 1920) worked with several Scout friends to organize troops in refugee camps in Germany. They were referred to collectively as the Hontalan Sasok or \\"Homeless Eagles\\". Bodn√°r led the K√ºlf√∂ldi Magyar Cserk√©szsz√∂vets√©g from its founding in 1945 until his death in the early 1990s. These groups from the Displaced Persons camps joined together to form the P√°l Teleki Scout Association. After the start of the Cold War and the rise of the Iron Curtain, which closed the borders of Hungary in 1948, the Communist government officially disbanded Scouting within Hungary's borders. To help preserve the traditions of Hungarian Scouting, the P√°l Teleki Scout Association changed its name to that of the now-banned national Hungarian Boy Scout association, Magyar Cserk√©szsz√∂vets√©g. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the refugees from World War II and the new Communist regimes in Eastern Europe were unable to return to their native country. Many emigrated to various countries. The first overseas troop was founded in 1950 in Rio de Janeiro, although it has since disbanded. Three troops founded in Caracas, Venezuela, were still active in 2009. Along with Brazil and Venezuela, troops were founded in the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries. The organization grew from about 1,000 members in the early 1950s to over 6,000 members in the late 1970s. The Hungarian Scouts-in-Exile were members of the Displaced Persons Scout Division of the Boy Scouts International Bureau, Council of Scout Associations in Exile and founding members of the Associated International Scout and Guide Organizations in 1976. The Magyar Cserk√©szsz√∂vets√©g-in Exile helped to restart Scouting in Hungary. Among them was Dr. B√©la H. B√°n√°thy, a long-standing member of the Hungarian Scout Association Abroad. B√°n√°thy had attended the 4th World Scout Jamboree held at G√∂d√∂ll≈ë in 1933. He later became personal friends with General Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas. General Farkas became Chief Scout of Hungary after Prime Minister P√°l Teleki committed suicide on the eve of Hungary's forced entry into World War II. B√°n√°thy was also Director of Leadership Development of the Magyar Cserk√©szsz√∂vets√©g for young men 18‚Äì24 years old at the Royal Ludovika Akademia during World War II. In 1992 B√°n√°thy traveled from the United States to Hungary following its renewed freedom to help restart the Hungarian Scout Association. With the introduction of democracy to Hungary in 1989, K√ºlf√∂ldi Magyar Cserk√©szsz√∂vets√©g returned the Association's original seal to Hungary and to the newly reorganized Hungarian Scout Association. The organization maintains close relationships with the reconstituted Magyar Cserk√©szsz√∂vets√©g in Hungary, and with independent Hungarian Scout Associations organized in areas of significant Hungarian minority populations in neighboring Slovakia, Croatia, Subcarpathian Ukraine, Romania, and Serbia. These areas had been part of Hungary prior to World War I and the Treaty of Trianon, which carved Hungary up into a much smaller nation. Since the advent of democracy in these countries, K√ºlf√∂ldi Magyar Cserk√©szsz√∂vets√©g has trained almost 500 Scoutmasters and assistant Scoutmasters for these brother associations. The World Organization of the Scout Movement maintains ties and provides support to the reemerging Scouting movements in the countries of their birth. In 1995 K√ºlf√∂ldi Magyar Cserk√©szsz√∂vets√©g held several 50th anniversary celebrations, sponsoring Jamborees in Fillmore, New York, Germany, and near Melbourne, Australia. The South American troops held a Jamboree late in 1996. Structure In 1997, the K√ºlf√∂ldi Magyar Cserk√©szsz√∂vets√©g had about 4,500 Scouts in 70 troops spread among five active districts worldwide: I) Europe, including Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden, and Great Britain; II) South America, specifically Brazil and Argentina; III) The United States and Venezuela; IV) Australia; and V) Canada. District III contained the largest number of Scouts in four councils: The New York Council has two troops in New York City; two troops in Garfield, New Jersey; two troops in New Brunswick, New Jersey; two troops in Philadelphia (no longer active); one troop in Boston; one troop in Wallingford, Connecticut; and one troop in Washington, D.C. The Cleveland Council has seven troops, four in Cleveland, and one each in Chicago, Buffalo, and Pittsburgh. The California Council has two troops in San Francisco and four troops in Los Angeles. Lastly, the Venezuelan council has three troops in Caracas. In cities around the world that contain substantial Hungarian populations, a Boy Scout and Girl Guide troop is either closely affiliated with or actually operates the Hungarian weekend schools. The organization has donated more than U.S.$350,000 to support adult leader training in the United States, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia.

Tetraodon biocellatus), commonly the figure 8 puffer or eyespot puffer, is a pufferfish found in freshwater in Southeast Asia. It is known from the lower reaches of the Mekong (Cambodia), the Peninsular Malaysia as well as Borneo (Sarawak, Kalimantan). Characteristics Figure 8 puffers grow to about long. They are colourful fish, with greenish yellow patterns on their backs. These patterns vary greatly from fish to fish, but the markings either side of the caudal fin resemble the number eight, or eye-spots (earning the species another common name as 'Eye-spot puffer'). Figure 8 puffers are relatively peaceful among Tetraodontidae, and have been kept successfully with other fish such as bumblebee gobies and mollies, but as with all pufferfish there is a risk that tankmates will not be tolerated. Like all members of its family, the figure 8 puffer is capable of inflating itself with water or air when stressed or otherwise frightened. In freshwater Like the closely related green puffer fish, the figure 8 exhibits euryhalinity, and undergoes epithelial remodeling and changes in the kidneys and gills when exposed to changes in salinity. Accordingly, the figure 8 puffer is often mistakenly regarded as an entirely freshwater fish, and has considerable resistance to freshwater exposure. In a marine environment, it exhibits typical saltwater fish morphological features in its gills, allowing it to secrete sodium chloride across the gill epithelium like a typical saltwater fish. However, acclimated to freshwater, the figure 8 puffer will exhibit specialized cells that do not match any gill ion-regulating cell of a freshwater fish. The other fish known to have these types of cells is the Mozambique tilapia (O. mossambicus), but this is a saltwater fish. In the aquarium Dichotomyctere ocellatus feeding on krill in an aquarium In captivity, figure 8 puffers require a 15 US gallon tank with temperatures between 24 ¬∞C and 28 ¬∞C. They are sensitive to nitrites and nitrates and must be introduced into a fully cycled aquarium. Over-filtration is recommended as well as frequent partial water changes. Water pH will reflect the brackish environment to which these fish are best suited; the addition of marine salt will buffer the pH to a range between 7.8 and 8.3. With a salinity of between 1.005 and 1.008 specific gravity (S.G.), the lifespan of this species has been as long as 15 years.The Puffer Forum, http://www.thepufferforum.com/forum/ug.php/v/PufferPedia/Brackish/T_Biocellatus/ (Retrieved 25 July 2007) As with all puffer fish, they require a complex aquarium set up consisting of many nooks and crannies. This helps figure 8 puffers to behave as they would in nature, and reduce boredom. Diet A figure 8 puffer with visibly overgrown teeth. Pufferfish are classed as molluscivores and feed mainly on benthic organisms which may include mussels, cockles, oysters and krill, though some puffers will take other foods, such as flake, it is not recommended that their primary food is flake. Their teeth, a beak formed from two plates, are capable of crushing shells in order to feed on prey. In captivity many fishkeepers feed snails as a substitute for the aforementioned foods as snails help keep the beak trim; it would otherwise be susceptible to overgrowth.

He is considered as leading figure of the realist movement, depicting the social evolution of post-World War II Switzerland with key themes ranging from Italian immigrants to the 1968 social unrest, the Disco years and the hopelessness of the 'No Future' youth. Life Mario Comensoli was born in Lugano on the 15 April 1922.http://www.comensoli.ch/englisch/publikationen_e/biblio.htm When his mother died, he was raised by his two sisters in extreme poverty and this sensitized the artist's character and made him aware of the social problems of the poor from the very beginning. In 1944, the Civic Museum of Fine Arts of Lugano acquired an oil painting after suggestion by Aldo Patocchi. On that same year, thanks to a scholarship, Comensoli went to Zurich where he started attending drawing and history of art lessons at the polytechnic institute. In Paris, in the early post-war period, he observed Picasso and L√©ger's work and was quite influenced by their Cubist paintings. In 1948, on his second time in Paris, Mir√≥, the Giacometti brothers and Poliakoff became his new artistic referrals. Establishing himself in Zurich with his wife H√©l√®ne Frei, he grew a passion for popular sports like cycling and football and created the series titled \\"Cyclists and footballers\\". In 1953, the Helmhaus Museum of Zurich dedicated him the first important exhibition which represented the past period under the lights of the Lumiere Villas and which received the approval of the critics. This first creative phase, which was centered on formal construction, soon left space for a new kind of painting that was more aware of reality and human experiences. In 1958 he created the \\"Workers in Blue\\" in the Rousseaustrasse studio. He dedicated it to the migrants coming from Italy to whom he felt close. In that same year, Carlo Levi invited him to exhibit his works at the Congress of Immigrants in Rome on whose poster one of the artist's drawings appeared. He subsequently tackled the themes of the protests of 1968 with a painting manner which was provocative and influenced by Pop Art. He then took on the world of cinema in 1978. In the 80s, starting from alternative punk youths, he started the series \\"Giovent√π in fermento\\" (Youth in Turmoil). To remember \\"Discovirus\\" and \\"Tell\\" among the most important thematic moments. Mario Comensoli died from a heart attack in his studio in Zurich on 2 June 1993. His last big exhibition took place in 1989 at the Kunsthaus of Zurich.

Location and characteristics Bottineau's boundaries are Lowry Avenue NE to the north, University Avenue NE to the east, 16th and 17th Avenues NE to the south, and the Mississippi River to the west. The neighborhood is named for its founder, Minnesota frontiersman Pierre Bottineau, who purchased land in the area in 1845. The neighborhood's location along the Mississippi River made it an ideal site for industry including grain mills, lumber mills and breweries. During the late 1800s and early 1900s the neighborhood became more residential (aided by an expansion of the city's streetcar system up 2nd Street NE). Bottineau suffered somewhat during the white flight of the 1950s and 1960s as many of the neighborhood's small businesses closed and single family homes were converted into multiple unit rental properties. Beginning in the 1980s, artists began to move to the neighborhood and converted formerly industrial spaces into studios. Today the neighborhood is a mixture of housing, studios/offices, and small businesses and is considered part of the Northeast Minneapolis Arts District. Bottineau is also the home of Tait Carlson. Landmarks Bottineau is home to three city parks: Bottineau Park, Edgewater Park and Gluek Park. Two charter schools are located in the neighborhood: New Visions School (K-8) and Menlo Park Academy (10-12). Many businesses are situated along University Avenue and Lowry Avenue. The neighborhood's California Building was one of the first buildings in the area to be converted into artist spaces and remains so today. Transportation Bottineau is served by Metro Transit bus routes 11 (2nd Street NE) and 32 (Lowry Avenue). 22nd Avenue NE is a bicycle boulevard and a short separated bike path runs along 18th Ave NE.

Pipefitters usually begin as helpers or apprentices. Journeyman pipefitters deal with industrial/commercial/marine piping and heating/cooling systems. Typical industrial process pipe is under high pressure, which requires metals such as carbon steel, stainless steel, and many different alloy metals fused together through precise cutting, threading, grooving, bending and welding. A plumber concentrates on lower pressure piping systems for sewage and potable water (tap water), in the industrial, commercial, institutional, or residential atmosphere. Utility piping typically consists of copper, PVC, CPVC, polyethylene, and galvanized pipe, which is typically glued, soldered, or threaded. Other types of piping systems include steam, ventilation, hydraulics, chemicals, fuel, and oil.https://tradesecrets.alberta.ca/trades-occupations/profiles/0074/ Steamfitter/Pipefitter Trade Profile. Alberta Trade Secrets. 1995-2010. In Canada, pipefitting is classified as a compulsory trade, and carries a voluntary \\"red seal\\" inter-provincial standards endorsement. Pipefitter apprenticeships are controlled and regulated provincially, and in some cases allow for advance standing in similar trades upon completion. In the United States, many states require pipefitters to be licensed. Requirements differ from state to state, but most include a four- to five-year apprenticeship. Union pipefitters are required to pass an apprenticeship test (often called a \\"turn-out exam\\") before becoming a licensed journeyman. Others can be certified by NCCER (formerly the National Center for Construction Education and Research). Occupational summary Pipefitters install, assemble, fabricate, maintain, repair and troubleshoot pipe carrying fuel, chemicals, water, steam and air in heating, cooling, lubricating and various other process piping systems. Pipefitters are employed in the maintenance departments of power stations, refineries, offshore installations, factories and similar establishments, by pipefitting contractors.

Wages vary from area to area, based on demands for experienced personnel and existing contracts between local unions and contractors. The United Association is also affiliated with the piping trades unions in Ireland and Australia. Difference between pipefitting and pipelaying Pipefitters should not be confused with pipelayers. Both trades involve pipe and valves and both use some of the same tools.Will Charpentier, Pipe Layers vs. Pipe Fitters, Demand Media. However, pipelayers usually work outside, laying pipe underground or on the seabed, while pipefitters typically work inside, installing piping in buildings, aeroplanes or ships. One author summarizes the different tasks this way: :Pipe layers operate the backhoes and trenching machinery that dig the trenches to accommodate the placement of sanitary sewer pipes and stormwater sewer drainpipes. They use surveyor‚Äôs equipment to ensure the trenches have the proper slope and install the pieces of pipe in the trenches, joining the ends with cement, glue or welding equipment. Using an always-open or always-closed valve called a tap, pipe layers connect them to a wider system and bury the pipes. :Pipe fitters plan and test piping and tubing layouts, cut, bend or fabricate pipe or tubing segments and join those segments by threading them, using lead joints, welding, brazing, cementing or soldering them together. They install manual, pneumatic, hydraulic and electric valves in pipes to control the flow through the pipes or tubes. These workers create the system of tubes in boilers and make holes in walls and bulkheads to accommodate the passage of the pipes they install.  Occupational hazards  Pipe fitters are often exposed to hazardous or dangerous materials, such as asbestos, lead, ammonia, steam, flammable gases, various resins and solvents including benzene, and various refrigerants. Much progress was made in the 20th century toward eliminating or reducing hazardous materials exposures. Many aspects of hazardous materials are now regulated by law in most countries, including asbestos usage and removal, and refrigerant selection and handling. Other occupational hazards include exposure to the weather, heavy lifting, crushing hazards, lacerations, and other risks normal to the construction industry.

It quickly grew to include classes from elementary school through university level. It moved to several different locations to accommodate its growing student population. With the patronage of Pope Gregory XIII, from 1582 to 1584 the final seat of the Roman College was built near the center of Rome's most historic Pigna district, on what today is called Piazza del Collegio Romano. The college remained at this location for 286 years until the Capture of Rome in 1870.In 1870, the new Italian government confiscated the property of the university and their building (that eventually became the Ennio Quirino Visconti Liceo Ginnasio), which forced the university to transfer to the Palazzo Gabrielli-Borromeo on the Via del Seminario. In 1873, the remaining philosophical and theological faculties of the Roman College formed the Gregorian University, named after the benefactor of the College in the sixteenth century and thus establishing the link with the previous institution. Since then the Gregorian University has occupied new quarters, but the buildings on this full square block memorialize the early commitment of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) to education. With the burgeoning student population the Jesuits in 1626 replaced the chapel of the Annunziata with the church of St. Ignatius on the premises. In 1787 the college added an observatory that became preeminent. With the Capture of Rome in 1870, the building was taken over by the Italian government. Currently, its eastern wing houses the headquarters of the Ministry of Heritage and Culture (with entrance on Via del Collegio Romano) and the wing that overlooks the square is home to the high school Ennio Quirino Visconti. Origins The first university founded by the Jesuits was the College of Messina in 1548. Then in 1551, to make up for the shortage of public schools in Rome and to provide for better training of both religious and secular clergy during the Counter-Reformation period, the Roman College was founded,Gosier, Chris. \\"Roman College Created to Be Epicenter of Jesuit Teaching\\", Fordham News, February 16, 2010 open only to men. The funding came from Francis Borgia, 4th Duke of Gand√≠a. He had been a professed member of the Society of Jesus since 1548 but secretly; he retained his rank while attending to his obligations and settling his children. In 1551 the Collegio Romano was a small, rented building at the base of the Capitoline Hill, on today's Piazza d'Aracoeli. Jesuit Fr. Polanco wrote of teaching Latin and Greek and later Hebrew: \\"Christian doctrine is taught. Above the door of the school a sign says: a free school of grammar, humanism, and Christian doctrine.\\" Jesuits were the first pupils: Edmond Auger (French), Emmanuel Gomez (Portuguese), John Egnazi (Florence), and Emerio de Bonis (Mantua). Within its first year the building could not accommodate the influx of students and Ignatius sought a larger facility. Without leaving the center of Rome, in September 1551 he rented a building on Via del Ges√π behind the ancient church of Santo Stefano del Cacco. This second home of the Roman College was called the House of Frangipani after the famous family which owned it. The building was later demolished. This then was the second home of the Roman College. Roman College to Gregorian University right Despite the cost, Ignatius wanted to begin teaching philosophy and theology in the school year 1553‚Äì1554. This increased the student body, both of Jesuits and externs. In 1555, the financial conditions became such that the students had to be distributed among the various colleges of the Society in Italy. On 17 January 1556 Pope Paul IV, seeing the great good that the Collegio Romano was for the young, gave it the privilege of conferring degrees in philosophy and theology with all the privileges of other universities. At this time also Ignatius founded the print shop which over the years introduced new typefaces, becoming the model in the business. Due to flood damage in that part of the House of Frangipani, and because of the growing number of students, the Roman College in 1558 moved to the house of Giovan Battista Salviati, that connected to the back of the church of Santa Maria in Via Lata, on the east side of today's Piazza del Collegio Romano. Jesuit theologian Francisco de Toledo was a professor at the college at this time.\\"Toledo, Francisco de\\", Christian Cyclopedia, (Erwin L. Lueker, Luther Poellot, Paul Jackson, eds.), Concordia Publishing House, 2000 Four years later, the Roman College became too small for the growing number of students and larger premises were sought. The building was demolished when Salviati built the new Roman College, since he wanted to enlarge the square for the Roman College. In 1560, Vittoria della Tolfa, Marchesa della Valle, a relative of Paul IV, donated an entire city block and its existing buildings to the Society of Jesus. 150px This remained the site of the Roman College until the takeover of its buildings by the Italian government in 1870. Ignatius of Loyola had died on 31 July 1556 and was succeeded by Fr. James P. Laynez, an original companion of Ignatius and a papal theologian during the three periods of the Council of Trent. The Jesuits used the existing block of buildings, awaiting a benefactor to build a college building for their burgeoning student population on their more than ample land. That benefactor came in the person of Pope Gregory XIII who took a liking to the nascent institution and in 1574 assigned larger annuities. Then in 1581 with funding from the Pope and his relatives, on 11 January 1582 his nephew Cardinal Filippo Boncompagni laid the foundation stone for the new college building, designed by Florentine architect Bartolomeo Ammannati. Classes began on 28 October 1584. A picture on display at the Roman College shows Pope Gregory XIII present at the inauguration. Later on, in memory of its benefactor, the Roman College took the name of Gregorian University.\\"Historical Hints\\", Pontifical Gregorian University College church 250px For a chapel, the Annunziata begun by the Poor Clares was completed by the Jesuits. It was built in 1562 and decorated in 1571 with a fresco by Federico Zuccari in the apse. Saints Stanislaus Kostka, Robert Bellarmine, Aloysius Gonzaga, and John Berchmans worshiped here. But by 1620 this proved too small for a student population that exceeded 2000. After the canonization of St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1622, Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi, nephew of Pope Gregory XV, financed the construction of much larger church named for the new saint. The old church and a part of a classroom wing of the Roman College were removed to make room for the church of St. Ignatius. It was designed by the Jesuit Orazio Grassi and solemnly consecrated in 1722. The flat ceiling and missing dome were frescoed by painter Jesuit Brother Andrea Pozzo, in a style that creates the illusion of depth (photo on right). Later developments Merz telescope. 2 - Main staircase to the Observatory. 3 - Observatory for the Ertel meridian circle. 4 - Observatory for the telescope of Cauchoix. 5 - Observatory electric tower with small lead ball. 6 - Antenna with globe dropped at midday as signal to fire the cannon at Castel Sant'Angelo (now on the Janiculum). 7 - Electric cables transmit signals from meteorological sensors on Calandrelli Tower to meteorograf recorder housed in room below main observatory. 8 - Rear of St. Ignatius facade. 9 - Back of Church of St. Ignatius. 11 - Tower Terrace. 12 - Roof of Palazzo Montecitorio, now the Chamber of Deputies. The Roman College became the center of academia in its time. It hosted many learned debates including those between Galileo Galilei and Paolo Segneri, master of oratory. The German Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher, \\"Master of a Hundred Arts\\", was a professor at the college and left on the premises a museum filled with his works.\\"Scientific Spectacle in Baroque Rome: Athanasius Kircher and the Roman College Museum\\", The Vatican Observatory The Jesuits were particularly drawn to astronomy and had a large observatory tower and scientific laboratories constructed on the roof of the annexed church, in 1787. The building of the College consists of two large, colonnaded courtyards and large classrooms. The Library of the Roman College, the most notable of Rome, was removed in 1873 and merged into the Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III. In 1773, with the suppression of the Society of Jesus, the Jesuits entrusted the college to the secular clergy. It was seriously damaged during the French occupation of Rome. After the restoration of the Jesuits, Pope Leo XII on 17 May 1824, with the brief Cum Fine, ordered the restitution of the Roman College with the outbuildings and church of St. Ignatius to the Society of Jesus. Leo himself was present for the inauguration of the new academic year on 2 November 1824. Fr. Giovanni Perrone was among the distinguished faculty of theology of that time. With the reopening of the Roman College the famous astronomical observatory was restored and enlarged. The Jesuits experienced a setback during the Roman Republic, when on 29 March 1848 they were expelled and their building became a Roman seminary. The following year the building was occupied and heavily damaged by the revolutionaries who burned a wing of the college. On 7 August 1849 the French arrived to liberate Rome. On 3 March 1850 the Roman seminary was returned and classes resumed. Twenty years later on 20 September 1870, with the occupation troops of Savoy in Rome, the college was used as a barracks for sharpshooters; classrooms were used for a technical school and high school. On 6 November 1870 the College was closed and the symbol of the Society of Jesus was chiseled from the doors; until then both the Jacobins and Mazzini had spared it. It remained open only as a school of philosophy and theology for the Roman clergy. On 17 January 1873 the libraries, astronomical observatory, scientific laboratory, and the Kircher Museum were taken over by the new government. With the extension of the rule of Savoy to the city of Rome, the Jesuits were finally removed. Pius IX protested against this usurpation with the encyclical Etsi fine luctuosa of 21 November 1873. The community of Jesuit professors found hospitality at the Palazzo Borromeo-Gabrielli as guests of the German College (moved elsewhere in 1886), now home to students of the Jesuit Bellarmine College. In this new site the school of philosophy and theology, with the official title of the Pontifical Gregorian University of the Roman College, resumed, fostered and protected by Pope Leo XIII. The Roman College would live on only through its philosophy and theology faculties, which had departed the premises in 1870. For the later history of these faculties see the article on the Gregorian University, which includes a list of notable students & professors from throughout the long history of the College/University.

Biography David Pujadas first went to the Lyc√©e International de Ferney-Voltaire for high school before graduating from the University of Aix-Marseille and Sciences Po, then he entered Paris' Centre for Journalist Training (CFJ) in 1988. Winner of a reporters' contest conducted by T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise 1 (TF1), he became a foreign correspondent there, covering most notably the fall of Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania in 1989, the Gulf War in 1991, and the siege of Sarajevo in 1992. He also presented the morning news and the 23:00 news during holidays of the regular presenters between 1992 and 1993. At the same time, from 1990 to 1994, he carried out research for Charles Villeneuve's investigative magazine \\"Le droit de savoir\\". At the end of June 1994, he joined LCI, TF1's new continuous news channel, where he presented newscasts regularly. Starting in September 1996 he handled the presentation of \\"Le Grand Journal\\" from 18:00 to 19:00. He also created the weekly magazine 100% politique. In September 2001, he replaced Claude S√©rillon as presenter of France 2's 20:00 news at the request of the new news director Olivier Mazerolle and covered the 9/11 events live on French television. On February 3, 2004, Pujadas announced in the opening of his news programme Alain Jupp√©'s official withdrawal from political life, while at the same moment Jupp√© stated at the end of a long interview on the TF1 show that he would give up his mandates over the course of the next year. Pujadas made his apologies for this error in the edition of the following day, but two days later, following a vote of no confidence by the channel's directors, he was sanctioned with two weeks of forced vacation during which he was replaced by his stand-in, Carole Gaessler. On February 11, 2004, Olivier Mazerolle tendered his resignation and was replaced by Arlette Chabot as head editor of France 2. During the 2005‚Äì2006 season, Pujadas presented \\"Le Contrat\\", a monthly political interview on the Parliamentary Channel. He has hosted \\"Madame, Monsieur, bonsoir\\" weekly with Herve Chabalier on France 5 since February 2006. During the 2012 French presidential election, he presented Des paroles et des actes (Words and Deeds), a broadcast in which candidates were confronted to their public image, their economic program, their possible strategies for campaign and to an opposition politician. He has also co-presented with Laurence Ferrari the televised debate between Fran√ßois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. Des paroles et des actes continued until 2016, when it was superseded by L'√âmission politique during the 2017 French presidential election, which he co-hosted with L√©a Salam√©. The French director of France T√©l√©visions decided the May 17th 2017 to remove him from his anchorman position at the end of the season, in order of a renewal in the second most watched newcast despite his good performances.http://www.lefigaro.fr/medias/2017/05/17/20004-20170517ARTFIG00121-david- pujadas-le-pilier-du-20-heures-de-france-2-sera-remplace-par-anne-sophie- lapix.php David Pujadas is member of the think tank Le Si√®cle.Fr√©d√©ric Saliba, 'Le pouvoir √† la table du Si√®cle', in Strat√©gies, issue 1365, April 14, 2005, p. 49 References 5\\\\. http://www.francetvinfo.fr/replay- jt/france-2/20-heures/jt-de-20h-du-jeudi-8-juin-2017_2217486.html Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish emigrants to France Category:French television presenters Category:French television journalists Category:French people of Catalan descent Category:People from Barcelona Category:Aix-Marseille University alumni Category:Sciences Po alumni ","title":"David Pujadas"},{"id":"7065795","text":"Alex Brummer (born 25 May 1949) is an English economics commentator, working as a journalist, editor, and author.

Illustrated Dictionary of the Muslim World Muslim World. Marshall Cavendish, 2010 p.79. His writings, some controversial, debated the role of religion and Islamic history in 20th-century politics and government. While the implication of his arguments still remain a point of debate, his 1925 book Islam and the Foundations of Governance argued against a role for religion in politics or the political prescriptive value of religious texts.Souad T. Ali. A religion, not a state: Ali 'Abd al-Raziq's Islamic justification of political secularism. University of Utah Press, 2009. Thomas M. Leonard (ed). Encyclopedia of the Developing World, Volume 2. Taylor & Francis, 2006. . p.878. He argued that Islamic texts were and should remain neutral in political debate and civil institution building. He attended Oxford University, and he was a scholar and jurist at Al-Azhar, Cairo. Biography Raziq was born in 1888 to a well-off family. His father, Hassan Abdel Raziq, was a large farm-owner and was, in 1907, among the founders of the Umma Party. His brother, Mustafa Abd al-Rizq, a well known philosopher, studied at Al- Azhar University under the famous reformer Muhammad Abduh. Raziq later received his 'alim degree from Al-Azhar in 1911. In 1912, he traveled to Oxford University to study economics and political science, but he returned to Cairo at the outbreak of the First World War. Back at Al-Azhar in 1915, he became a qadi (religious judge) in Mansoura. Ali became famous for his book Islam and the Foundations of Governance (Al-Islam Wa Usul Al-Hukm), published in 1925, and Consensus and Islamic Law (Al-Ijma¬¥ Fi Ash-Shari¬¥ah Al- Islamiyyah), published in 1947. Following popular debate about his 1925 book, Al-Azhar stripped him of his office, but he got it back in the 1940s. Ali, his father and his brother remained close to the Liberal Constitutional Party.Panayiotis J. Vatikiotis. Egypt since the revolution. Issue 7 of Studies on modern Asia and Africa. Praeger, 1968. pp.151-152. He eventually became a government minister and lost his position as scholar and jurist at Al-Azhar. He twice served as Minister of Endowments, one of the three highest positions in religious administration, beside the Rector of Al-Azhar and the Grand Mufti. Raziq died in 1966. Work The argument of his 1925 book has been summarized as \\"Islam does not advocate a specific form of government\\".Elizabeth Suzanne Kassab. Contemporary Arab Thought: Cultural Critique in Comparative Perspective. Columbia University Press, 2010. p.40 He focused his criticism both at those who use religious law as contemporary political proscription and at the history of rulers claiming legitimacy by the caliphate.Bertrand Badie, Dirk Berg-Schlosser, Leonardo Morlino (eds). International Encyclopedia of Political Science, Volume 1. SAGE, 2011. p.1350. The focus of this debate was Turkish leader Mustafa Kemal's abolition of the caliphate in 1924, and the response of some Arab Muslim scholars that it was incumbent upon Arabs, in particular, to reinstate the caliphate in Arab lands. Raziq wrote that past rulers spread the notion of religious justification for the caliphate \\"so that they could use religion as a shield protecting their thrones against the attacks of rebels\\".Kemal H. Karpat. The Politicization of Islam: Reconstructing Identity, State, Faith, and Community in the Late Ottoman State. Studies in Middle Eastern History. Oxford University Press, 2001 pp.242-243. The journalistic and academic debate that Raziq's book set off projected him into fame. The thesis Islam and the Foundations of Governance (Al-Islam Wa Usul Al-Hukm) was published recently by Hamed, the grandson of Abdel Raziq, with a familial introduction. Raziq remains controversial, and his specific arguments are part of a longer tradition of jurisprudence and scripture.Jasser Auda. Maqasid Al-Shariah as Philosophy of Islamic Law: A Systems Approach. IIIT, 2007. p.173 His work has since been both praisedFouad Ajami. The Arab Predicament: Arab Political Thought and Practice since 1967. Edition 2, revised, Cambridge University Press, 1992. p.232 and condemned, as a precursor of secularist philosophy in Muslim societies.Kassab (2010) pp.29, 32-33, 173, 225. It has been criticized as having drawn on the works of Orientalist western writers.John L. Esposito. Islam and Secularism in the Middle East. NYU Press, 2000. Secularism He was regarded as the intellectual father of Islamic secularism (the separation of state and religion, not the secularization of society). Its controversial standpoints regarding the necessity of the caliphate and religious government made the book trigger an intellectual and political battle in Egypt. In essence, it claims that the Muslims may agree on any kind of government, religious or worldly, as long as it serves the interest and common welfare of their society. Arguments * The two main sources of Islamic law (sharia), the Quran and the Sunnah (the tradition of Muhammad), neither demand nor reject the rule of a caliph or imam. * There is no real ijma (consensus) on the necessity of the caliphate. * Experience shows that the caliphate was a series of disasters for the Muslim community, and there is no single rational argument for the re-establishment of the caliphate. As Raziq recounts the horrors of the caliphate, among other things, one can conclude that he advocated a humanist kind of governance, probably a democratic state. The word 'secular' entered the Arab lexicon at the turn of the 20th century, bringing with it a host of meanings and interpretations. It was first introduced into Arab discourse, as a reference to the separation between religion and state. That later evolved to become \\"la dini\\", irreligious. In current circles, secularism is often both understood as \\"almaniya\\" and associated with immorality or the lack of ethics.

Wallace' is a medium sized, Crozy Group canna cultivar; green foliage, oblong shaped, white margin, spreading habit; round stems, coloured green; flowers are open, pale yellow with red spots, staminodes are large, edges regular, stamen is rose-red with small yellow flecks; fertile both ways, not self-pollinating or true to type, capsules round; rhizomes are thick, up to 3 cm in diameter, coloured white and pink. Introduced by the venerable firm of Wilhelm Pfitzer, Fellbach, Germany in 1907, and named for Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet. In the same year it was awarded the RHS Award of Merit (AM), entered as a Crozy Group cultivar and the RHS described it and classified it as such. There can be no doubt that this Pfitzer bred cultivar is a Crozy Group cultivar. From the mid-1970s onwards, many nurserymen have confused this fine heritage cultivar with the Italian Group cultivar Canna 'Austria'. Prior to this the US nursery catalogues show that the correct plant was being sold under this name. The only similarity with C. 'Austria' is the basic colours of the foliage and flowers. The shapes and style are very different. Research indicates that in the Spring Hill Nurseries, USA catalogue of 1972 there is an illustration which shows a floppy Italian Group, not a Crozy Group, type and they may be the original source of confusion.

He is Dietrich Bonhoeffer Professor of Theology and Ethics at Union Theological Seminary in New York City. Early life and education Born in 1935 and raised in Virginia, Morse received a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy from Randolph‚ÄìMacon College, a degree from Yale Divinity School, and Master of Sacred Theology and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from Union Theological Seminary. He is an ordained elder in the United Methodist Church. Viewpoints Morse's areas of scholarly concentration are dogmatics and ethics. He teaches extensively on the great systematic and dogmatic theologians, especially John Calvin, Karl Barth, Thomas Aquinas, and Friedrich Schleiermacher. Prominent in his main work, Not Every Spirit, is the notion of \\"faithful disbelief\\", a reference to 1 John 4:1. Essentially, Morse stands the older dogmatic traditions on their head. While most theologians argue for what Christians should believe, Morse argues for what people of faith should not believe, but rather actively \\"disbelieve\\". Some examples of Morse's \\"Christian Disbeliefs\\" are: * Refusal to equate the Word of God with an object, including the Bible, turning God into a thing. * Refusal to believe that God's Word in scripture violates witness of God to the heart. * Refusal to believe that God's witness in the heart denies God's Word in scriptures. * Refusal to believe that love, as defined with reference to God, can be defeated. * Refusal to believe that God is other than Father, Son, and Spirit. * Refusal to believe that God is three gods. * Refusal to believe that any form of domination is from God that is not the dominion of love. * Refusal to believe that the life of Jesus Christ is not fully human. * Refusal to believe that the Jesus Christ is not fully God. * Refusal to believe that Jesus Christ is limited by time and space. * Refusal to believe that the risen Christ is somehow different from the incarnate Christ. * Refusal to believe that we can cause faith in another. * Refusal to believe that God the Holy Spirit is not life giving. * Refusal to believe that evil is of equal status to good. * Refusal to believe that the future belong to any but God, or that there is no future. * Refusal to believe that any situation is hopeless ‚Äì any situation. * Refusal to believe that humans do not need saving. * Refusal to believe that Jesus Christ is too unlike humans to save them. * Refusal to believe that Jesus Christ is too like others to be able to save humans. * Refusal to believe that we are truly human apart from other humans. * Refusal to believe that God dishonors the human body and that we will be raised as disembodied spirits. * Refusal to believe that Church members are more loved than non- church members. * Refusal to believe that the Church is limited by the successes and failures of its members. He has argued that there is a charge from God upon the Christian community to discern the will of God again in every generation, time, and place and to be watchful for those aspects of the tradition which are unfaithful to the will and Word of God. Morse's work shows that he has been deeply shaped by the theology of Karl Barth. However, he is clearly no Barthian, and is additionally influenced by the classical theologies of Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Wesley, Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli. Among recent theologians, Morse has been deeply influenced by the work of Reformed theologians Jurgen Moltmann, H. Richard Niebuhr, and Paul Lehmann. Morse's work could be categorized as an example of the so-called Yale School theology.

It does not penetrate the blood‚Äìbrain barrier to a significant amount and thus combines an effective block of the H1 receptor in peripheral tissue with a low incidence of central side effects, i.e. seldom causing sedation or drowsiness. It was patented in 1983 and came into medical use in 1990. The substance is often provided in micronised form due to poor water solubility. Uses Ebastine is a second-generation H1 receptor antagonist that is indicated mainly for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. It is available in 10 and 20 mg tablets and as fast-dissolving tablets, as well as in pediatric syrup. It has a recommended flexible daily dose of 10 or 20 mg, depending on disease severity. Data from over 8,000 patients in more than 40 clinical trials and studies suggest efficacy of ebastine in the treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis, persistent allergic rhinitis and other indications. Safety Ebastine has shown overall safety and tolerability profile with no cognitive/psychomotor impairment and no sedation worse than placebo, and cardiac safety, that is, no QT prolongation. The incidence of most commonly reported adverse events was comparable between the ebastine and placebo groups, which confirms that ebastine has a favourable safety profile. While experiments in pregnant animals showed no risk for the unborn, no such data are available in humans. It is not known whether ebastine passes into the breast milk. Pharmacokinetic profile After oral administration, ebastine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 into its active carboxylic acid metabolite, carebastine. This conversion is practically complete. Carebastine, the active metabolite Brand names Ebastine is available in different formulations (tablets, fast dissolving tablets and syrup) and commercialized under different brand names around the world, Ebast, Ebatin, Ebatin Fast, Ebatrol, Atmos, Ebet, Ebastel FLAS, Kestine, KestineLIO, KestinLYO, EstivanLYO, Evastel Z, Ebasten (ACI), etc.  References   External links  * Category:H1 receptor antagonists Category:Ethers Category:Piperidines Category:Aromatic ketones Category:Peripherally selective drugs ","title":"Ebastine"},{"id":"7065888","text":"TAWPI was a membership association that focused on the improvement of work processes in data capture, document and remittance processing.

He played as a goalkeeper for Plymouth Argyle, Everton, Sheffield Wednesday, Leicester City, Hartlepool United and Rochdale. His career lasted from 1977 to 1996 during which time he played 602 league and cup matches. Football career Hodge was spotted by Plymouth Argyle while playing for the amateur team Southport Trinity and was given a trial by the Devon Club. He signed as an apprentice for Argyle, and graduated through their youth scheme to make his debut during the 1977‚Äì78 season. He signed as a professional in February 1977, as he turned 18 years old. He played five times during 1977‚Äì78 and then forced his way into the first team to be the regular goalkeeper for 1978‚Äì79. Argyle had a pretty average season in Division Three that year but Hodge's form caught the eye of Everton and he signed for them in July 1979 for a fee of ¬£135,000. The 20-year-old Hodge had been signed by Everton as second choice keeper to George Wood, however Hodge forced his way into the first team in November 1979 with his good early form and played 23 league matches that season plus an FA Cup semi-final against West Ham United. After that first season Hodge's opportunities were limited by the arrival of Neville Southall and he had spells on loan at Preston North End, Oldham Athletic and Gillingham before moving to Sheffield Wednesday in the summer of 1983 in a ¬£50,000 deal. Hodge was a typical signing by the then Wednesday manager Howard Wilkinson in that he was a player who had shown early promise but had lost his way somewhat. Hodge was not expected to be first choice for Wednesday for the 1983‚Äì84 season with Iain Hesford expected to be number one goalkeeper. However a combination of Hodge's good pre season form and Hesford' weight problems ensured that Hodge played the opening match of the season against Swansea City and never looked back. His time at Sheffield Wednesday was excellent he played 214 consecutive League and Cup matches, a club record beating Mark Hooper's previous record of 189 and was part of the Wednesday side which gained promotion back to Division One in 1983‚Äì84 and then had several good seasons on their return to the top flight.\\"The Men Who Made Sheffield Wednesday Football Club\\", Tony Matthews, , Gives biographical information. In total Hodge played 246 times for Wednesday and kept 60 clean sheets before leaving for Leicester City in March 1988, he is remembered at Hillsborough as a fine goalkeeper. Hodge was part of an unusual and rare incident on 25 October 1986 when during the Sheffield Wednesday v Coventry City match, City goalkeeper Steve Ogrizovic scored a freak goal directly from a kick out of his hand with the help of a following wind. This was an embarrassing incident for Hodge and one that he was continually reminded of by fans for many years.Coventry. Vital Football Gives details of Ogrizovic goal. Hodge's excellent form at Wednesday made him a favourite to make the England squad for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico and was even measured up for and received a squad blazer. However Hodge cruelly missed out at the last minute when Gary Bailey supposedly recovered from injury only to break down again in Mexico. Hodge has said that this was the biggest disappointment of his career.\\"The Wednesday Boys - The Definitive history of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club\\", Jason Dickinson & John Brodie, , Page 141, Gives biographical information. Hodge's ¬£250,000 move to Leicester was not a great success, as he tore a stomach muscle in his first match and was out injured for several months. He made 80 appearances in three years before moving to Hartlepool in the summer of 1991, where he stayed for two years before joining Rochdale for a season. In the summer of 1994 he moved back to his first club Plymouth, where he played for two seasons and was also involved in coaching the youth team before retiring from professional football in May 1996.Soccerbase Gives career statistics. In the summer of 1996 Hodge returned to Sheffield Wednesday as goalkeeping coach.

The work has also been translated into French. It and the other books in the series purport to fill in some of the ancient prehistory of the lost city of Opar, created by Edgar Rice Burroughs as a setting for his Tarzan series. Plot In this continuation of Hadon's adventures in the ancient Africa of 12,000 years ago, the last-ditch defense of the High Priestess he and his allies mounted against the tyrannical King's evil schemes segues into a perilous chase through various exotic cities, seas and islands. Hadon undertakes to take his mate, now pregnant with his child, to safety at his native city of Opar, but is pursued by members of a dark cult in the service of the king. The book ends as the war just gets seriously going, and with only tantalizing glimpses given of various interesting locations. Hadon's beloved clearly appears destined to a crucial future role which is never quite reached. Plainly, Farmer provided for further sequels which were never written.

It first aired on the NBC network in the United States on February 12, 2004. Plot In the opening scene, Phoebe tells Joey that her stepfather is unable to get a day release from prison to walk her down the aisle for her wedding. She then asks Joey to substitute for him and walk her down the aisle, telling him how much he has been like a father to her. He enthusiastically agrees, and then spends most of the episode acting tense and weird to everyone else. Monica is driving Phoebe insane when she is planning Phoebe's wedding, barking orders military style, complete with headset. At the rehearsal dinner, Chandler and Ross find out that they are not included in the wedding and complain to Phoebe, who tells them they were next in line. When one of Mike's groomsmen is unable to make it, Mike lets Phoebe decide who gets to be in the wedding, a job she passes to Rachel as a \\"bridesmaid job\\". During a rehearsal toast, Phoebe gets really upset with Monica for rushing her and making sure everything is spotlessly perfect even if no one likes it, and yells at Monica for not being able to give her the simple wedding she always wanted. She then finishes her angry speech off by firing Monica on the spot. The next day, Phoebe is going through hell doing Monica's job, having items turning up in the wrong places and not knowing the technical name for orchids. Ross manages to convince Rachel to choose him as a groomsman by promising to always be on his best behaviour but later Chandler also wins her over by relating to her his feelings about always being left out of important events in his life. However, she is unable to tell Ross she changed her mind, and after he and Chandler encounter each other with misgivings, they both confront her. With Rachel again unable to decide, Mike decides to have his dog, Chappy, as the missing groomsman. Unable to cope with planning her own wedding, Phoebe gives Monica her job back, wanting her to be \\"Crazy Bitch\\" again. However, Joey informs the others of a giant blizzard, which has caused huge traffic problems and a major power outage to most of the city. As the snow begins to subside, Phoebe and Mike still want to get married, so they decide to do the simple wedding service in the street outside Central Perk with Monica's blessing. With the snow, Chappy cannot walk on his own, so Ross and Chandler both volunteer to hold him. Ross gets the job because Chandler is afraid of dogs, but Ross soon regrets it when the dog smells. With the minister cut off in the snow, Joey takes over because he is still ordained from Monica and Chandler's wedding. Chandler then substitutes for Phoebe's father, and as he walks her down the aisle, Phoebe refuses to wear a coat even though it is freezing, choosing to be her \\"something blue\\". Phoebe and Mike get married with almost no problems; after being pronounced as husband and wife, Phoebe complains about being cold, so Mike puts his jacket on her to keep her warm. Reception Purple Clover chose the episode as one the 20 funniest episodes of Friends. In Digital Spy's ranking of the 236 Friends episodes, \\"The One with Phoebe's Wedding\\" was placed at #44.

Thrift Jr. (February 25, 1929 ‚Äì September 18, 2006) was an American scout and executive in Major League Baseball who served as the general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1985 to 1988, and the de facto general manager of the Baltimore Orioles from 1999 to 2002. During a 50-year career in professional baseball, he also spent time as a player, scout, or executive with the New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, Oakland Athletics, and Kansas City Royals. Early career Thrift was born in Locust Hill, Middlesex County, Virginia, part of the historic Middle Peninsula area, where his mother and father ran a general merchandise store. He graduated from Randolph-Macon College and served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War. While working as high school teacher and coach from 1953 to 1956, Thift was a part-time scout for the New York Yankees and Pittsburgh Pirates, becoming the Pirates' scouting supervisor in 1957. He left the Pirates after the 1967 season to join the Kansas City Royals as scouting director and in 1970 founded the Kansas City Royals Baseball Academy. Renowned for its player development, the Academy produced 14 major league players. After two years with the Oakland Athletics, Thrift started a successful real-estate business in Fairfax, Virginia. Return to baseball Thrift had been out of baseball for nine years when in 1985 he was the surprise choice for general manager by a new Pirates ownership group. Thrift hired a relatively unknown Jim Leyland, then the Chicago White Sox third base coach, as manager. Together they turned the last place Pirates around and by 1988 the club finished second to the New York Mets, which was considered by some a miracle. Thrift's time in Pittsburgh ended immediately after the 1988 season when he was fired after butting heads with team ownership. Thrift's management and personnel decisions were later widely attributed for the team's subsequent success, as they won National League Eastern Division titles from 1990 through 1992. In March 1989, Thrift became the Yankees' vice president of baseball operations, signing a five-year contract. In June, George Steinbrenner ordered Thrift and the scouts to stop traveling to evaluate talent as a cost-saving measure. Thrift resigned from the Yankees on August 30. Thrift also served as a consultant to the New York Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Francisco Giants and Tampa Bay Devil Rays. In 1990 he and sports writer Barry Shapiro wrote his autobiography, The Game According to Syd: The Theories and Teachings of Baseball's Leading Innovator. Legacy With his Virginia drawl, garrulous nature and endless supply of stories, Thrift brought a fresh eye to evaluating talent and building teams. Rickey Henderson, Frank White, Al Oliver and Bobby Bonilla were among the notable players originally scouted or signed by Thrift. Retirement After retiring from baseball in 2004, he settled in Kilmarnock, Virginia and was the co-host of a syndicated radio program sponsored by Major League Baseball. He was honored by The Sporting News as one of the best teachers in baseball. He received an honorary doctorate of laws by Randolph-Macon College and their Distinguished Alumnus Award. In 1995 he was presented with the Edwin Rommel Award for his years of contribution to the sport of baseball. In 1996 he was inducted into the Middle Atlantic Major League Baseball Scouts Hall of Fame. And in 1998 he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and the Randolph-Macon College Athletic Hall of Fame. Death Thrift died September 18, 2006 at Milford Memorial Hospital in Milford, Delaware at age 77 following apparent complications from knee replacement surgery earlier that day. Survivors included his wife, Dolly Thrift; two sons; and five grandchildren.

(1732). A General Collection of Treaties of Peace and Commerce, Manifestos, Declarations of War, and other Publick Papers, from the End of the Reign of Queen Anne to the Year 1731. University of Toronto. pp 457-485 The signing of this treaty marks the founding of the Austro-Spanish Alliance and led the Fourth Anglo-Spanish War (1727-1729). This new alliance thereby removed Austria from the Quadruple Alliance. In addition to a formation of the new partnership, the Habsburgs relinquished all formal claims to the Spanish throne, while the Spanish removed their claims in the Southern Netherlands, and a number of other territories. Treaties on commerce between the two countries were also formally established. The main article of importance is the Spanish recognition of the Ostend East India Company and the permission of free docking rights which included the rights to refuel in the Spanish colonies. In addition, the treaty publicly signed certifying an alliance was only a defensive one, though later in the year, both parties signed a secret treaty which founded a general alliance between both nations.  Principle Conditions   Peace Provisions   Friendship between Spain and the Empire  Due to recent conclusion of the War of the Quadruple Alliance (1717-1720) and the earlier War of the Spanish Succession (1700-1714), and even though both of these wars had prior states of peace written, Austria and Spain both saw it necessary to make an established bilateral peace on matters that affected both nations personally. In fact, this peace was directly modeled off the previous Treaty of London (1718) and the Treaty of The Hague (1720). > \\"That there be a Christian, General, and perpetual Peace, and sincere > Friendship between his Imperial and Catholic Majesty, and his Catholic > Majesty the King of Spain their Heirs and Successors, hereditary Kingdoms, > and the Subjects and Provinces thereof; the said Peace to be inviolably > observed and cultivated...\\"  Claim to the Kingdoms of Sardinia  Prior to the War of the Spanish Succession, the Kingdom of Sardinia had always been under the personal union to the King of Spain (and previously Aragon).Geronimo Zurita, Los cinco libros postreros de la segunda parte de los Anales de la Corona d'Aragon, Oficino de Domingo de Portonaris y Ursono, Zaragoza, 1629, libro XVII, pag. 75‚Äì76 Though, in 1708, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the Austrians occupied Sardinia and the crown shifted to the ownership of Charles VI.McKay, Derek. \\"Bolingbroke, Oxford and the Defence of the Utrecht Settlement in Southern Europe\\". The English Historical Review,. 86:339 (1971), 264‚Äì84. In 1720, the Kingdom was parceled out to Duke Victor Amadeus II of the House of Savoy, whereupon it was joined with the Savoyard lands to create the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont.Symcox, Geoffrey (1983). Victor Amadeus II: absolutism in the Savoyard State, 1675-1730. Berkeley: University of California Press. . Charles VI agreed to officially abandon his claim to the Kingdom. Stately Quadrille. The signatories of the Treaty of Vienna are in blue, the Treaty of Hanover in red, and the Treaty of Berlin in grey. > \\"In the same Condition it was in when he made himself Master of it; and > renounced, in favour of his Imperial Majesty, all Rights, Pretensions, > Demands and Claims on the said Kingdom; so that his Imperial Majesty might > fully and freely dispose of the same, as of his own Property, in such manner > as he has done for the sake of the public Good.\\"  Recognition of the Peace of Utrecht  A principle agreement in the Peace of Utrecht was the newly seated Spanish Bourbons would be barred from ascending to the French throne; vice versa for the French Bourbons and the Spanish throne, thereby eliminating a possible personal union between France and Spain.James Falkner (2015). The War of the Spanish Succession 1701-1714. Pen and Sword. p. 205. This agreement was simply reaffirmed, which denotes the seriousness of this matter. > \\"In relation to the Right and Order of Succession to the Kingdoms of France > and Spain; and renounces, as well for himself as for his Heirs, Descendants, > and Successors, Male and Female, all Rights and Pretensions whatsoever in > general, without any Exception, to any the Kingdoms, Territories and > Provinces of the Spanish Monarchy, whereof the Catholic King was by the > Treaty of Utrecht acknowledged lawful Possessor...\\" King Louis XIV.|263x263px  Habsburg renunciation of the Kingdom of Spain  Emperor Charles VI also relinquished all familial claims to the Kingdom of Spain, which allowed King Philip V to be considered the rightful claimant of the Spanish throne without dissent. Charles was following in the actions of Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans, who had also waived his claims to the Spanish throne during the Peace of Utrecht ten years earlier. > \\"By virtue of the said Renunciation, which his Imperial Majesty made for the > sake of the general Safety of Europe, and in consideration that the Duke of > Orleans had renounced, for himself and his Descendants, his Rights and > Pretensions to the Kingdom of Spain, on Condition that neither the Emperor, > nor any of his Descendants should ever succeed to the said Kingdoms; his > Imperial and Catholic Majesty acknowledges King Philip V. for lawful King of > Spain and the Indies; and will likewise let the said King of Spain', his > Descendants, Heirs and Successors, Male and Female, peaceably enjoy all > those Dominions of the Spanish Monarchy in Europe, in the Indies, and > elsewhere, the Possession whereof was secured to him by the Treatys of > Utrecht...\\"  Spanish renunciation of the Kingdom of Sicily  The Kingdom of Sicily, similar to Sardinia, was a former Spanish possession, and was occupied by the Austrians during the War of the Spanish Succession; and in the Peace of Utrecht, the Kingdom was ceded to the Duke of Savoy. Though, in 1717, during the War of the Quadruple Alliance, the Austrian's occupied Sicily once again. The only difference being that the Victor Amadeus II was an ally of the Empire, and had been invaded by the Spanish to be reacquired once again as a possession. Therefore, the Austrian takeover of Sicily as a direct possession under Charles VI was debated as to whether the acquisition was legitimate or not. Regardless of Austrian legitimacy, Philip V renounced his personal and filial claims to the Kingdom of Sicily. > \\"His Catholic Majesty renounces likewise all Rights of Reversion to the > Kingdom of Sicily, which had been reserved to the Crown of Spain; and all > other Claims and Pretensions...\\" Only ten years later, Sicily would again shift into Bourbon (not Spanish) hands. The Duke of Parma, Charles I d'Bourbon, would conquer Sicily from the Austrians in the War of the Polish Succession (1734-1735) and would be crowned the independent 'Charles V' as King of Sicily in 1735. Charles would later be crowned King of Spain as 'Charles III' in 1759, after the death of his brother Philip V. Though Charles was obligated to give up his Italian possessions to his son Ferdinand I. The lands of the Low Countries in 1700, the Spanish Netherlands in light grey.  Spanish renunciation of the Southern Netherlands  Prior to 1714, the Spanish had owned a portion of low-country territory which had become known as the Spanish Netherlands. The Spanish had owned the territory starting with the abdication of Charles V (Charles I in Spain) as Holy Roman Emperor in 1556. Before Spanish ownership, it was occupied by the Austrians who conquered the provinces the War of the Burgundian Succession (1477-1482). After the Austrians re-occupied the territory during the War of the Spanish Succession, it was decided at the Peace of Utrecht the lands of the Spanish Netherlands should pass once again to the Austrians. Philip V agreed to a renunciation of his claims to the area in this article: > \\"And all other Claims and Pretensions, under Colour of which he might > directly or indirectly disturb his Imperial Majesty, his Heirs and > Successors, either in the above-mentioned Kingdoms and Provinces, or in any > other Dominions which his Imperial Majesty actually possesses in the > Netherlands and Italy, or any where else\\" 206x206px  Succession in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany  The final disputed territory was the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Charles VI came to an agreement with Philip V that his heirs and siblings would have legal rights to Tuscany. Grand Duke Gian de' Medici was ailing without issue and decided to be bedridden for the end of his reign.Acton, Harold (1980). The Last Medici. London: Macmillan. . Rights to the Duchies of Parma and Piacenza were also granted to the Spanish Bourbons. The catch being these duchies would remain fiefs of the Holy Roman Empire, and not be independent of Imperial affairs. > \\"His Imperial Majesty, out of regard to the most serene Queen of Spain, has > already consented, with a Reservation of the Consent of the Empire; and that > being obtained, does again consent, that if, at any time, the Duchy of > Tuscany, as also the Duchies of Parma and Piacenza, which are acknowledged > by the contracting Parties in the Treaty of London to be undoubted Male > Fiefs of the Empire, shall on failure of Male Issue ever happen to become > vacant, and be open to the Disposal of the Emperor and Empire\\" Map of the Tuscan region with the Isle of Elba and Livorno.  Spanish concessions in Livorno and Elba  King Philip V agreed to establish the City of Livorno as a free port of entry for both parties. The Tuscan Isle of Elba and the Town of Porto Logone were agreed to be ceded to the future claimant and owner of the throne of Tuscany upon their accession. In addition to these concessions, Philip V was obligated to rescind his claims on these duchies. > \\"The Catholic King does, moreover, promise and oblige himself to yield and > deliver up the Town of Porto Longone, together with that part of the Island > of Elba which he possesses, to the aforesaid Prince, his and the Queen's > Son, as soon as he shall, in due Time and Order, attain the actual > Possession of the Dukedom of Tuscany. And he renounces for himself and his > Successors, Kings of Spain, ail Rights of claiming, acquiring, or ever > possessing any Thing in the said Duchies...\\" 328x328px  Spanish recognition of the Pragmatic Sanction  An important victory for Charles VI was Philip V's acceptance of Charles' Pragmatic Sanction of 1713. While Charles agreed to withdraw his claims to the Spanish throne and consented to defend the Spanish succession, Philip agreed to the Austrian Succession. The Spanish recognition of the Sanction would continue Charles VI's lifelong pursuit to secure his daughter Maria Theresa's succession to the Austrian throne and approval in an Imperial Election. > \\"His Imperial Majesty further promises, that he will defend and guaranty, > and, as often as there shall be occasion, maintain the Order of Succession > settled in the Kingdom of Spain...the King of Spain promises likewise to > defend and guaranty that Order of Succession, which his Imperial Majesty, > according to the Intention of his Ancestors, has declared and established in > his most serene House...and has been cheerfully and dutifully acknowledged > and entered among the public Acts, to have the Force of a Law and Pra2gmatic > Sanction of perpetual Validity.\\"  Commerce Provision  328x328px  Ostend East India Company  The main commerce clause within the treaty was the recognition of the Ostend East India Company. Philip V granted the Company permission to dock and resupply in Spanish dominions and states across the globe, providing these ships produce proper documentation. The Ostend Company was granted the same privileges granted to the United Provinces in matters of trade. > \\"It shaII be allowed to bis Imperial Majesty's Subjects and Ships to carry > and import from the East-lndies, into any of the King of Spain; States and > Dominions, all forts of Fruits, Things, and Merchandises: provided it appear > from the Certificates of the deputies of the India Company, erected in the > Austrian Low Countries, that they are the 'Produce of the 'Places conquered, > the Colonies, or the Factories of the said Company, or that they came from > thence; and in this Respect they shall enjoy the fame Privileges that were > granted to the Subjects of the United Provinces...\\"  Defensive Provisions   Austro-Spanish alliance  The last of the three separate treaties written in Vienna was the defensive military alliance between the Habsburgs and Spain. After Spain's severe loss in the War of the Quadruple Alliance (1717-1720) and weakening in the War of the Spanish Succession (1700-1714) the balance of power needed to be reset in Europe; and the Habsburgs believed making peace and fostering a new relationship with the Spanish would spark a realignment of control. Both army and naval support were guaranteed in the event of either nation being attacked by a foreign power. > \\"That there be and remain a solid and sincere Friendship betwixt his > Imperial Catholic Majesty and his Royal Catholic Majesty and that the fame > be so cultivated on both sides, that the one shall promote the Advantages > and avert the Injuries of the other as much as their own.\\"  Restitution of Gibraltar and Menorca  A principle condition on the formation of the alliance was the Spanish claims in Gibraltar and Menorca. These territories were annexed by the British during the War of the Spanish Succession, and Spain began quickly scheming on how to reacquire them. Habsburg support for the restitution was not military but financial; and promoted itself as a mediator for the peace succeeding the future war. > \\"And whereas it has been represented by the Minister of the most Serene King > of Spain, that the Restitution of Gibraltar.....his Sacred Imperial and > Catholic Majesty, that he will not oppose the said Restitution, if it be > effected in an amicable manner; and that if it be thought necessary, he will > make use of all good Offices for that purpose, and if the Party's desire it, > he will also act in the Affair as Mediator.

Awards & Winners. Retrieved 13 September 2014. Life and career Yeats-Brown was born in Genoa in 1886, the son of the British consul Montague Yeats-Brown. He studied at Harrow and Sandhurst. When he was 20 he went to India, where he was attached to the King's Royal Rifle Corps at Bareilly in present-day Uttar Pradesh. He was then transferred to the cavalry and sent to the perennially turbulent North West Frontier region. His time there engendered in him a sympathy for the Muslim point of view, and in later years he would support the creation of an independent Pakistan. During the First World War, Yeats-Brown saw action in France and in Mesopotamia, where he was a member of the Royal Flying Corps. His acts of bravery gained him the DFC. In 1915, his plane, piloted by Thomas White, was damaged on landing on a sabotage mission outside Baghdad, and he spent the following two years as a prisoner of war. That provided the material for his first book, Caught by the Turks (1919). Following a temporary commission in the Royal Air Force, he returned to the Indian Army in August 1919. He retired from the army in 1924, and joined the staff of the Spectator magazine as assistant editor. He quit the post in 1928. The Lives of a Bengal Lancer, Yeats-Brown's most famous book, was published in 1930. The book is a memoir of his time in India from 1905 to 1914, with an emphasis on cantonment life at and around Bareilly. An immediate hit with readers and critics, the book won the James Tait Black Award that year and was turned into a successful 1935 film of the same name, starring Gary Cooper. In 1936, he published Lancer at Large, in which he showed an affinity for the principles of yoga. During the 1930s, Yeats-Brown also became involved in right-wing politics. He was a member of the January Club and the Right Club,Anna Wolkoff and wrote newspaper articles in praise of Francisco Franco and Hitler, asserting that Hitler had solved Germany's unemployment problem. He also wrote articles for New Pioneer, a far-right journal controlled by Viscount Lymington and closely linked to the British People's Party.Martin Pugh, Hurrah for the Blackshirts! Fascists and Fascism in Britain Between the Wars, Pimlico, 2006, p. 279 In 1937, Hitler told Yeats-Brown in person in Nuremberg that the film The Lives of a Bengal Lancer was one of his favourites and had made it compulsory for all SS members. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, Yeats-Brown took up a commission again.

James Sherman (21 February 1796 ‚Äì 15 February 1862), was an English Congregationalist minister. He was an abolitionist, and a popular preacher at The Castle Street Chapel in Reading from 1821 to 1836. He and his second wife Martha Sherman made a success of Surrey Chapel, Blackfriars, London from 1836‚àí54. Martha died in 1848. Sherman was successor at the Surrey Chapel to Rowland Hill. Although he was subsequently became known as a Congregationalist, Sherman was originally ordained to the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion. Early life The son of an officer in the East India Company, he was born in Banner Street, St. Luke's, London, on 21 February 1796. After some education from dissenting ministers, he spent three years and a half as apprentice to an ivory-turner. Sherman entered, on 6 November 1815, the Countess of Huntingdon's Cheshunt College. He preached his first sermon in London in Hare Court chapel, Aldersgate Street, in 1817, and on 26 Nov. 1818 he was ordained to the ministry in Sion Chapel, Whitechapel. After preaching for some time in the Countess of Huntingdon's chapel at Bath, Somerset, he was appointed permanent minister of her chapel at Bristol, where he made the acquaintance of Hannah More and of Mary Anne Schimmelpenninck. In April 1821 he moved to Castle Street chapel, Reading, Berkshire. Association with the London Missionary Society James Sherman was a prominent supporter of missionary work, principally the work of the non-denominational London Missionary Society. The missionary Rev. Samuel Oughton was sent to Jamaica from Sherman's Surrey Chapel in 1836; an arrangement on behalf of the Baptist Missionary Society, a body that worked closely with the LMS, and practiced congregational principles of church governance. Founding of Abney Park Cemetery Shortly before 1840, James Sherman became a founding trustee and director of the Congregationalist's new non-denominational enterprise - Abney Park Cemetery. All parts of the grounds were to be open for burial to everyone, regardless of denomination, without invidious dividing lines. It became the first garden cemetery in Europe to be wholly non-denominational in this respect whilst also having just one chapel, to be shared by everyone. Published books Martha Sherman James Sherman's earliest works were devotional, but in the 1840s he developed his writing skills as a biographer. In 1848 James Sherman wrote The Pastor's Wife, a biography of Mrs Sherman in memory of her death that year from consumption on 18 May. He later completed a biography of Rowland Hill and the Quaker philanthropist and abolitionist William Allen. Work towards slavery abolition Of political significance in the 1850s was a semi-fictional book written on one side of the Atlantic, to which James Sherman contributed an introduction written on the other. This was Uncle Tom's Cabin, by the American Congregationalist Harriet Beecher Stowe, with Sherman's introduction from London. The number of copies of the work sold was unprecedented in American literature. It was written in serial form for The National Era, an abolitionist newspaper, in 1851. When it appeared as a two volume work by March 1852, with Sherman's introduction, it quickly became a historic work. For the book's promotional tour in London in the early summer of 1852, Stowe, her husband, and her brother Charles Beecher, stayed at Sherman's house. At the same time he invited the African-American escaped slave and Congregational minister Samuel Ringgold Ward, and assisted his stay in Britain for nearly a year, helping him raise funds for the Canadian Anti- slavery Society at a time when many escaped slaves from the USA were trying to reach freedom in British Canada. Later life The modern marker stone to Rev James Sherman, Abney Park Cemetery, London Sherman became minister at Blackheath Congregational Church 1854-62 and was succeeded at Surrey Chapel by Christopher Newman Hall. Hall continued Sherman's abolitionist cause by visiting America during the Civil War, and publishing books and making speeches to enlist British support on the side of the north: England should side with the North, he wrote, particularly because emancipation of the slaves is just. Death and memorial Memorial to Rev. James Sherman and Martha Sherman at Abney Park Cemetery, London James Sherman died at his home in The Paragon, Blackheath, and was buried in a plain stone chest tomb at Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington, London - the Congregationalist's novel non- denominational garden cemetery of which he was a founder director and trustee. His memorial stone is visible amongst the undergrowth from the westmost path. A modern marker stone has been placed in front of the original in order to distinguish the grave as seen from the path.

It is part of the Relevant Radio Christian network. History Radio station WWCA, an ABC Radio affiliate in Gary, experienced its peak in popularity during the 1960s and 1970s primarily because of its community commitment and the popularity of its on-air personalities. Residents of Gary, Merrillville, Crown Point, Hobart and other northwestern Indiana cities and towns depended on WWCA for local news and sports coverage. Area residents tuned to WWCA for live on-the-scene coverage of breaking news events as well as weekly live coverage of high school sports. Broadcasts of basketball tournaments involved most of the on- air personalities broadcasting from multiple locations throughout northwestern Indiana. Popular daytime programs included Tom Higgins‚Äô morning program, Sound-Off at noon with Ted Thorne, and afternoons with Matt Hart. Morning news was delivered by Morris Wayne. Ted Thorne and Doug Kullerstrand handled mid- day news chores. Play-by-play coverage of high school sports was the work of sports director Frank Sauline. WWCA's nighttime audience belonged to jazz/soul-music deejay Jesse Coopwood. The Coopwood show was the highest rated evening show in the Chicago area during the 1970s. During that time Coopwood worked with news reporter Tony Rose. Rose was a staple in the news department at WWCA from 1970 through the mid-1980s. After spending most of his career at WWCA, Coopwood was hired away by competitor WLTH in the late 1970s. Coopwood was replaced by a series of soul deejays, none of whom earned the level of listenership Coopwood brought to the station. WWCA was owned by Lake Broadcasting, Inc. President and founder Dee O. Coe established the station in 1949 and operated studios that had housed WIND before that station moved to Chicago. WWCA operated then out of the old Hotel Gary. Coe also owned WLOI in LaPorte, IN and other stations throughout the state. Co-owners of WWCA included its chief engineer Vic Voss and the Burns family, operators of a Gary funeral home. Other key personnel included general manager Joseph Haas, news & program director Ted Thorne and Sales Manager Al Evans. The station‚Äôs studios were moved from Hotel Gary to the fourth floor of the First Federal Saving and Loan Association building at 545 Broadway. Licensed to the city of Gary, the station's transmitter was located in a then rural area south of the Gary city limits near 49th Avenue and Chase Street. The station's signal was directional, then requiring transmitter operators to hold 1st Class Federal Communications Commission (FCC) operator licenses. Thorne, though a resident of Michigan City, IN, hosted the mid-day Sound-Off program which had a large following and delivered expanded newscasts at noon and again at 5 PM. Thorne left WWCA for a stint with WGN-TV, Channel 9, in Chicago, but later returned to the Gary station. Another WWCA personalities to leave for Chicago and eventually network air work was Frank Reynolds, then a news reporter. Reynolds joined WLS-TV Channel 7 in Chicago and later became a television anchor for ABC News. Emery King, also a reporter and host of the evening \\"Sound-Off\\" program in the early 1970s later worked for WBBM-TV Chicago and was White House reporter for NBC News before becoming a television anchor with WDIV Detroit. During the 1980s deejay Vivian Carter joined the staff hosting a Saturday morning program. Carter was better known in the area as \\"the hostess with the mostest\\" when she hosted a daily program for WJOB radio in Hammond, IN. She and husband James (Jimmy) Bracken owned a small record shop/recording studio in Gary. Jimmy's brother was part of the signing group, The Spaniels, which gained huge success in the 1950s. Vivian and Jimmy formed their own label VeeJay Records and began producing the Spaniels. The label's success took Vivian away from local radio for a period of years. After moving operations to California VeeJay signed other notable's such as The Four Seasons; The Beatles whose VeeJay album is a prized collectible; and Gladys Knight & The Pips (known as simply \\"The Pips\\" at the time). The popularity of WWCA's talk shows (noon Sound-Off and Sound-Off at 6PM) gave some regular callers nearly celebrity status. Listeners came know the voices of callers such as \\"the theory lady,\\" \\"Mr. Pitts,\\" \\"Mrs. Archie,\\" and then city councilman Gene Kirtland. In the late 1960s WWCA air personalities joined the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. Relationships between station management and personnel remained strained from that time forward. In the years that followed some individuals responsible for unionizing the staff were released from their jobs. A fire set in the early 1970s in the office of News Director Thorne was thought to be in retribution for the firings. The fire was contained in Thorne's office and little damage was done. In the mid-1980s general manager Joe Hass developed leukemia to which he died from soon after its diagnosis. Owner Dee Coe also developed the same disease shortly thereafter and the station was sold. Coe had already put the station on the sale block before he died. When Haas died Coe named Haas' secretary, Sylvia Burns, General Manager, a position she kept until the new owners took over. (Burns was no relation to stockholders of the same name.)Coe's death came relatively soon after Haas died. Coe's son, Ken Coe, who managed the family's LaPorte station, WLOI, took over the reins at WWCA for a short time before the station was sold. Also licensed to Gary, WWCA's primary local radio competitor during the 60s and 70s was daytime-operated WLTH, 1370 AM. WWCA's license moved from Gary to East Chicago in the early 90s,(R. Veronica Williams former News Director of Willis Broadcasting Network A.M. 1270 WWCA, (later with Chicago Public Radio WBEZ 91.5 F.M.)(later of Radio-One Indianapolis A.M.1310 \\"The Light\\"/106.7 WTLC F.M. and A.M.) after the station was purchased by Willis Broadcasting. The city of license returned to Gary sometime in the late 1990s prior to ending daily broadcasts in January 2002. In 2003, Willis Broadcasting Corp. sold the station to Starboard Broadcasting for $1.5 million.

A combined fire authority (CFA) is one created by a statutory instrument to cover more than one local authority area. Usually each of the constituent local authorities appoints a fixed number of members of the CFA, depending on their relative populations. Constitution A fire authority is made up of either councillors, officers or representatives from the local principal councils in the geographical area that the fire service operates. In the case of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, there is an additional layer of governance above in the form of the London Assembly. The responsible central government department in England and Wales is the Home Office, previously the Department for Communities and Local Government had responsibility until January 5, 2016.https://www.gov.uk/government/news/fire-and-rescue-policy-to-move-to-the- home-office Role of a fire authority In simple terms a local fire authority is a supervisory body which ensures that a local fire service performs efficiently and in the best interest of the public and community it serves. It means therefore that the fire service is answerable for its actions and performance to the general public. One of its main functions is to collect funding from each local council via a precept - a portion of council tax allocated to the FRS. Powers of a fire authority Although a fire safety officer is an employee of the fire service and is authorised and answerable to the Chief Fire Officer to exercise powers of inspection, any enforcement or prosecution action taken against organisations by the fire service is brought in the name of the fire authority, under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005. The Fire Service's powers of entry and other operational roles are defined by the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 Fire & Rescue Services Act 2004, Pub: The Stationery Office, Crown copyright (accessed 15 Jan 07) This act provides the legal basis for fire authorities to carry out community rather than legislative fire safety functions.

They are often used temporarily or permanently by women after mastectomy or lumpectomy procedures, but may also be used by for aesthetic purposes. There are a number of materials and designs; although, the most common construction is gel (silicone or water- based) in a plastic film meant to feel similar to a person's skin. Prostheses may be purchased at a surgical supply store, pharmacy, custom lingerie shop, or even through private services that come to a person's home. There are many types of ready made breast prostheses including full or standard prostheses, partial prostheses such a shell prostheses, and stick on prostheses. Customized options are also available from specialty shops, which are moulded to fit an individual's chest by taking an impression of the breast(s). The areola and nipple may be replicated as part of the breast form or as separate nipple prosthesis. Both custom made and off-the shelf breast prostheses come in varieties that are designed to either be held in a pocket in a specially designed mastectomy bra or attached to the skin via adhesive or other methods and worn with a standard bra. There are many factors to consider when selecting breast prostheses such as different types and the care they require, insurance coverage, and psychosocial effects.  Uses  External breast prostheses are commonly used in women who have undergone surgical treatment for breast cancer such as a mastectomy or lumpectomy. They have a variety of physical benefits including improved symmetry and balance, as well as psychological benefits such as improved self-confidence. Outside of post- surgical uses, prosthetics are also used by individuals to create the illusion of breasts.  Mastectomy  Breast prostheses are most commonly used after a mastectomy, usually a consequence of cancer. They are often molded to mimic the natural shape of a woman's breast and can either be used temporarily or for long-term use as an alternative to, or prior to surgical breast reconstruction. Depending on the type of mastectomy performed, progress of post-operative healing, and other various factors, surgeons will determine the time when a woman can start to use a prosthesis. A prescription may be required for breast prostheses and mastectomy bras for insurance purposes. Up to 90% of women use a prosthetic after surgery, temporarily or permanently. Over half of these women choose full weight options, while others will opt for more lightweight prosthetic devices. Some choose to make homemade prostheses, using materials such as rice and cotton.  Post-mastectomy bras  Post- mastectomy bras are similar to regular bras with the exception of containing spandex stretch pockets on the inside that help keep the breast prosthesis in place. Post-mastectomy bras can be found at specialty shops or mastectomy boutiques and some shops are also willing to stitch pockets into regular bras and swimsuits.to hold prostheses.  Post-surgical camisoles  Post- surgical camisoles are convenient for women to be used immediately after their breast surgery, especially if their breasts feel sore or sensitive. They are often made with soft cotton fabric and are designed to avoid rubbing or causing irritation to the skin. The camisoles have pockets for draining and similar to post-mastectomy bras, they have stitching to help hold fiber breast prosthesis in place. Right after breast surgery, women are advised to avoid or limit their arm and shoulder movement; camisoles are ideal for this reasons because they are pulled over the hip.  Attachable breast prostheses  Attachable breast prostheses can be used as an alternative to post-mastectomy bras. Attachable breast prostheses can be attached directly to the skin via adhesives and can also be worn with a regular bra.  Homemade breast prostheses  Some women may choose to re-purpose the supplies found in their homes to create homemade breast prostheses. For example, shoulder pads or nylons may be used as fillers for their bras. Homemade versions can be ideal for those who prefer loose-fitting clothes where the breast shape is not as defined.  Lumpectomy  After a lumpectomy or a quadrantectomy individuals may be left with an asymmetrical silhouette. Breast prostheses can help to act as an equalizer to accommodate for the missing tissue. Examples of breast prostheses after small but not total breast tissue removal include partial breast prosthesis, and attachable breast prostheses (also known as a contact prostheses). Partial breast prosthesis are available in a variety of materials such as silicone, foam, or fiber. These inserts are able to discretely fit into a regular bra or into the insert of a mastectomy bra. Attachable breast prostheses anchor directly onto your body and are secured using adhesive or Velcro. Attachable prostheses can be custom made as a partial breast shape, as well as coming readily available in full sizes. These prostheses, unlike the partial prostheses, move independent of a bra and can be worn along with a regular bra. For those who do not want a bra specially designed for prostheses, an attachable option may be a consideration.  Breast enhancement   Transgender  Many pre or non-hormonal trans women and men who cross-dress as women use breast prostheses in order to create the illusion of feminine breasts. They are sometimes combined with cleavage enhancement techniques when used with clothing with low necklines. Example of a man wearing a cleavage top Full frontal Cleavage Tops are also available, mainly marketed to the Transgender community. They incorporate a pair of breast prostheses in a one-piece skin coloured garment that is designed to provide the illusion of natural cleavage. Such garments have the disadvantage of having a visible top edge at the neck, which requires the wearing of a choker or similar necklace to hide the top edge of the garment. The edges of the breast prostheses are often distinguishable through the thin outer cover.  Psychosocial considerations  After a lumpectomy or mastectomy, both physical and psychological health of women can be affected as an outcome of tissue removal. A breast prosthesis is an alternative post- surgical option to breast reconstruction to aid with these consequences. Breast tissue removal can leave women with an altered center of gravity, and could have negative impacts on posture as well as balance. A prosthesis may help to correct balance and posture deficiencies caused by tissue removal. Additionally, partial or full loss of a breast can result in loss of self- esteem for some women. As a result, they may have feelings of introversion, shyness, or insecurity about their new appearance. Breast prostheses may not only add to physical appearance, it may also have psychological benefits by providing a sense of femininity for women.  Types   Styles  * Full/standard prosthesis - This prosthesis goes directly onto the breast wall and is used in those who have had all breast tissue removed. Size, shape and skin tone can be customized to matched your other breast, or if both breasts have been removed, any size may be selected. * Partial prosthesis - Partial prosthesis contain two layers of silicone with a thin layer of film to gently adhere to the breast. Unlike a full prosthesis, this can be used in situations where part of the breast has been removed. It is worn over the breast tissue inside the bra to create a fuller appearance and fill the breast outline. * Shell prosthesis - When breasts differ in size from each other, this type of partial prosthesis can be used. A soft shell of made of silicon is placed around the smaller breast to help match the size of the larger one. Shell prosthesis can be used right after surgery and are ideal for periods of inactivity. They are typically made to have a polyester front with a breathable cotton backing and are lightweight. * Stick-on prosthesis - This prosthesis sticks onto the skin and can be either full or partial. Women who have a more active lifestyle, or who wish to place less weight on their bra, prefer this prosthesis. Another benefit is that strapless clothing can be worn with this prosthesis, as long as the clothing can provide some support. * Custom-made prosthesis - Some shops can customize prosthetics to match natural color, size of other breast, and the bodies natural contour. Silicon and latex materials are normally used, however these customized prosthetics are more expensive than those that are not custom made.  Shapes  Non-customised prostheses are made of different shapes to suit the extent of breast tissue removal or the shape of a crossdresser's chest. Asymmetric breast forms incorporate an extension towards the armpit to replicate the shape of the tail of Spence, while symmetric \\"triangle\\" or \\"teardrop\\" prostheses do not incorporate that extension. Customised prostheses will mirror the other breast.  Weight  Silicone breasts come in a variety of weights to fit the needs of the user and are typically designed to have the same weight as natural breasts. Lightweight forms that are about 20-40% lighter than the standard form are ideal for physical activity such as sports or for sleeping.  Temperature  Some users find that prostheses can get hot in warm and humid climates, though newer breast prostheses are designed to allow for better air circulation. Using a bra pocket or a prosthesis cover may also help with perspiration, however, it is important to cleanse the prosthesis often to prevent the perspiration from damaging the prosthesis.  Skin tone  Many prostheses are available in colors which can suit different skin tones. Additionally, while finding an exact match for any skin tone may be difficult, companies have begun to add custom color to breast prostheses in order to match different skin tones. There may also be covers available for the prosthesis that can provide an even closer match.  History  Breast prostheses have a long history. In the 19th century they were made of rubber. On the 27 January 1874, a U.S. patent for a \\"breast pad\\" was issued to Frederick Cox (No. US 146805). His design consisted of rubber pads filled with air encased in cotton. Later in 1885, Charles L. Morehouse received US patent 326915 for his \\"Breast-Pad\\", made of natural rubber and inflatable with air at normal pressure. Newer designs such as that of Laura Wolfe's in 1904 parted with the air-filled design, which was prone to punctures, in favor of down feather and silk floss filling. While breast forms were mainly sold for post- surgical purposes, over time the aesthetic potential of these prosthetics was explored. Breast form development increased in the mid 20th century as more companies began to sell and market a variety of breast forms with new materials made possible by chemical engineering advancements. Eventually, marketing for breast prosthetics expanded to target people other than cisgender women looking for a surgical prosthetic or cosmetic enhancement. Companies like NearlyMe created branded products for trans and non-binary individuals.  Other Considerations   Insurance  Breast prostheses or mastectomy bras are covered by most insurances. To get these covered one should obtain a prescription from their physician with the diagnosis and a documentation of need. External breast prostheses are covered under Medicare part B following mastectomy; surgeries in the outpatient setting are also covered under Part B while part A covers mastectomy surgeries in the in patient setting. Custom-made prostheses are not usually covered by insurances due to their high costs.  Care  Although breast prosthesis specific for swimming exist, extra care should be given to immediately rinse them after swimming to avoid damage from chlorine or saltwater. In general, a silicone breast prosthesis should be treated like one's own skin; it should be washed daily with soap and water and dried after. Some prosthesis may require additional or more specific care to keep it clean. Sharp objects such as brooches or pins should be avoided as they may puncture silicone breasts and cause leaking.

He became chairman of Wanderers in October 1999, at the same time Sam Allardyce was appointed as manager. While Gartside was chairman, the club gained promotion to the Premier League and reached the UEFA Cup for the first time in their history. He was unable to hold on to Sam Allardyce, allowing him to resign (only to be appointed manager of Newcastle United weeks later). Bolton were relegated to the Championship in 2012. He oversaw a number of high profile arrivals to the playing staff at the club, including Nicolas Anelka, Youri Djorkaeff, Jay-Jay Okocha, Fernando Hierro and Iv√°n Campo. He was a prominent football administrator, a Football Association Board Member and an executive director of the new Wembley Stadium. On 23 April 2009, Gartside proposed a plan to his fellow Premier League chairmen about splitting the Premier League into two divisions of eighteen teams in each, and allowing Scottish Premier League clubs Celtic and Rangers to join. UEFA have said they will not veto the proposed move. Health At the beginning of December 2015, it was reported that he was gravely ill, and his family requested privacy.

Kevin Walker (1992) found an extension to rational homology 3-spheres, called the Casson‚ÄìWalker invariant, and Christine Lescop (1995) extended the invariant to all closed oriented 3-manifolds. Definition A Casson invariant is a surjective map Œª from oriented integral homology 3-spheres to Z satisfying the following properties: *Œª(S3) = 0. *Let Œ£ be an integral homology 3-sphere. Then for any knot K and for any integer n, the difference ::\\\\lambda\\\\left(\\\\Sigma+\\\\frac{1}{n+1}\\\\cdot K\\\\right)-\\\\lambda\\\\left(\\\\Sigma+\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\cdot K\\\\right) :is independent of n. Here \\\\Sigma+\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\cdot K denotes \\\\frac{1}{m} Dehn surgery on Œ£ by K. *For any boundary link K ‚à™ L in Œ£ the following expression is zero: ::\\\\lambda\\\\left(\\\\Sigma+\\\\frac{1}{m+1}\\\\cdot K+\\\\frac{1}{n+1}\\\\cdot L\\\\right) -\\\\lambda\\\\left(\\\\Sigma+\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\cdot K+\\\\frac{1}{n+1}\\\\cdot L\\\\right)-\\\\lambda\\\\left(\\\\Sigma+\\\\frac{1}{m+1}\\\\cdot K+\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\cdot L\\\\right) +\\\\lambda\\\\left(\\\\Sigma+\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\cdot K+\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\cdot L\\\\right) The Casson invariant is unique (with respect to the above properties) up to an overall multiplicative constant. Properties *If K is the trefoil then ::\\\\lambda\\\\left(\\\\Sigma+\\\\frac{1}{n+1}\\\\cdot K\\\\right)-\\\\lambda\\\\left(\\\\Sigma+\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\cdot K\\\\right)=\\\\pm 1. *The Casson invariant is 1 (or ‚àí1) for the Poincar√© homology sphere. *The Casson invariant changes sign if the orientation of M is reversed. *The Rokhlin invariant of M is equal to the Casson invariant mod 2. *The Casson invariant is additive with respect to connected summing of homology 3-spheres. *The Casson invariant is a sort of Euler characteristic for Floer homology. *For any integer n ::\\\\lambda \\\\left ( M + \\\\frac{1}{n+1}\\\\cdot K\\\\right ) - \\\\lambda \\\\left ( M + \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\cdot K\\\\right ) = \\\\phi_1 (K), :where \\\\phi_1 (K) is the coefficient of z^2 in the Alexander‚ÄìConway polynomial abla_K(z), and is congruent (mod 2) to the Arf invariant of K. *The Casson invariant is the degree 1 part of the Le‚ÄìMurakami‚ÄìOhtsuki invariant. *The Casson invariant for the Seifert manifold \\\\Sigma(p,q,r) is given by the formula: :: \\\\lambda(\\\\Sigma(p,q,r))=-\\\\frac{1}{8}\\\\left[1-\\\\frac{1}{3pqr}\\\\left(1-p^2q^2r^2+p^2q^2+q^2r^2+p^2r^2\\\\right) -d(p,qr)-d(q,pr)-d(r,pq)\\\\right] :where ::d(a,b)=-\\\\frac{1}{a}\\\\sum_{k=1}^{a-1}\\\\cot\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi k}{a}\\\\right)\\\\cot\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi bk}{a}\\\\right) The Casson invariant as a count of representations Informally speaking, the Casson invariant counts half the number of conjugacy classes of representations of the fundamental group of a homology 3-sphere M into the group SU(2). This can be made precise as follows. The representation space of a compact oriented 3-manifold M is defined as \\\\mathcal{R}(M)=R^{\\\\mathrm{irr}}(M)/SU(2) where R^{\\\\mathrm{irr}}(M) denotes the space of irreducible SU(2) representations of \\\\pi_1 (M). For a Heegaard splitting \\\\Sigma=M_1 \\\\cup_F M_2 of M, the Casson invariant equals \\\\frac{(-1)^g}{2} times the algebraic intersection of \\\\mathcal{R}(M_1) with \\\\mathcal{R}(M_2). Generalizations Rational homology 3-spheres Kevin Walker found an extension of the Casson invariant to rational homology 3-spheres. A Casson-Walker invariant is a surjective map ŒªCW from oriented rational homology 3-spheres to Q satisfying the following properties: 1\\\\. Œª(S3) = 0. 2\\\\. For every 1-component Dehn surgery presentation (K, Œº) of an oriented rational homology sphere M‚Ä≤ in an oriented rational homology sphere M: :\\\\lambda_{CW}(M^\\\\prime)=\\\\lambda_{CW}(M)+\\\\frac{\\\\langle m,\\\\mu\\\\rangle}{\\\\langle m, u\\\\rangle\\\\langle \\\\mu, u\\\\rangle}\\\\Delta_{W}^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}(M-K)(1)+\\\\tau_{W}(m,\\\\mu; u) where: *m is an oriented meridian of a knot K and Œº is the characteristic curve of the surgery. *ŒΩ is a generator the kernel of the natural map H1(‚àÇN(K), Z) ‚Üí H1(M‚àíK, Z). *\\\\langle\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot\\\\rangle is the intersection form on the tubular neighbourhood of the knot, N(K). *Œî is the Alexander polynomial normalized so that the action of t corresponds to an action of the generator of H_1(M-K)/\\\\text{Torsion} in the infinite cyclic cover of M‚àíK, and is symmetric and evaluates to 1 at 1. *\\\\tau_{W}(m,\\\\mu; u)= -\\\\mathrm{sgn}\\\\langle y,m\\\\rangle s(\\\\langle x,m\\\\rangle,\\\\langle y,m\\\\rangle)+\\\\mathrm{sgn}\\\\langle y,\\\\mu\\\\rangle s(\\\\langle x,\\\\mu\\\\rangle,\\\\langle y,\\\\mu\\\\rangle)+\\\\frac{(\\\\delta^2-1)\\\\langle m,\\\\mu\\\\rangle}{12\\\\langle m, u\\\\rangle\\\\langle \\\\mu, u\\\\rangle} :where x, y are generators of H1(‚àÇN(K), Z) such that \\\\langle x,y\\\\rangle=1, v = Œ¥y for an integer Œ¥ and s(p, q) is the Dedekind sum. Note that for integer homology spheres, the Walker's normalization is twice that of Casson's: \\\\lambda_{CW}(M) = 2 \\\\lambda(M) . Compact oriented 3-manifolds Christine Lescop defined an extension ŒªCWL of the Casson-Walker invariant to oriented compact 3-manifolds. It is uniquely characterized by the following properties: *If the first Betti number of M is zero, ::\\\\lambda_{CWL}(M)=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\left\\\\vert H_1(M)\\\\right\\\\vert\\\\lambda_{CW}(M). *If the first Betti number of M is one, ::\\\\lambda_{CWL}(M)=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}_M(1)}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{torsion}(H_1(M,\\\\mathbb{Z}))}{12} :where Œî is the Alexander polynomial normalized to be symmetric and take a positive value at 1. *If the first Betti number of M is two, ::\\\\lambda_{CWL}(M)=\\\\left\\\\vert\\\\mathrm{torsion}(H_1(M))\\\\right\\\\vert\\\\mathrm{Link}_M (\\\\gamma,\\\\gamma^\\\\prime) :where Œ≥ is the oriented curve given by the intersection of two generators S_1,S_2 of H_2(M;\\\\mathbb{Z}) and \\\\gamma^\\\\prime is the parallel curve to Œ≥ induced by the trivialization of the tubular neighbourhood of Œ≥ determined by S_1, S_2. *If the first Betti number of M is three, then for a,b,c a basis for H_1(M;\\\\mathbb{Z}), then ::\\\\lambda_{CWL}(M)=\\\\left\\\\vert\\\\mathrm{torsion}(H_1(M;\\\\mathbb{Z}))\\\\right\\\\vert\\\\left((a\\\\cup b\\\\cup c)([M])\\\\right)^2. *If the first Betti number of M is greater than three, \\\\lambda_{CWL}(M)=0. The Casson‚ÄìWalker‚ÄìLescop invariant has the following properties: *If the orientation of M, then if the first Betti number of M is odd the Casson‚ÄìWalker‚ÄìLescop invariant is unchanged, otherwise it changes sign. *For connect-sums of manifolds ::\\\\lambda_{CWL}(M_1\\\\\\\\#M_2)=\\\\left\\\\vert H_1(M_2)\\\\right\\\\vert\\\\lambda_{CWL}(M_1)+\\\\left\\\\vert H_1(M_1)\\\\right\\\\vert\\\\lambda_{CWL}(M_2) SU(N) In 1990, C. Taubes showed that the SU(2) Casson invariant of a 3-homology sphere M has a gauge theoretic interpretation as the Euler characteristic of \\\\mathcal{A}/\\\\mathcal{G}, where \\\\mathcal{A} is the space of SU(2) connections on M and \\\\mathcal{G} is the group of gauge transformations. He regarded the Chern‚ÄìSimons invariant as a S^1-valued Morse function on \\\\mathcal{A}/\\\\mathcal{G} and used invariance under perturbations to define an invariant which he equated with the SU(2) Casson invariant. () H. Boden and C. Herald (1998) used a similar approach to define an SU(3) Casson invariant for integral homology 3-spheres.

Biography The second-eldest in a family of nine, Coughlan lived with his parents in the family home in Inchicore, Dublin. While only in his teens during the Irish War of Independence, he took up arms against the Black and Tans and later against the Free State forces in the Irish Civil War. As a known member of the Dublin Brigade of the IRA, he was interned by the \\"Free Staters\\" during the Civil War, but if anything became even more active and determined to continue the fighting though his side had lost the war. Together with two fellow-detainees - Archie Doyle and Bill Gannon - he took part in forming a secret \\"vengeance grouping\\". The three vowed that once free of imprisonment they would take revenge on their opponents, whom they considered traitors to the Irish cause. Most such private revenge pacts were broken up by the IRA leadership when it reorganized following 1924, but Coughlan and his two fellow conspirators persisted and carried through their deadly aim. On July 10, 1927, the three surprised Justice Minister Kevin O'Higgins on his way to Mass at the Booterstown Avenue side of Cross Avenue in Blackrock, County Dublin and shot him down. (By one version, as he lay dying O'Higgins declared his forgiveness of his killers.) O'Higgins was especially hated by IRA members for having ordered the executions of seventy-seven of their fellows during the Civil War, an act for which he outspokenly took responsibility and refused to express any remorse. Moreover, he was a dominant member of the Free State government and the conspirators had good reasons to believe that his death would weaken it. Coughlan and his companions managed to escape after the O'Higgins assassination, but he was killed six months later, on the evening of January 28, 1928, in circumstances which remain controversial up to the present. On that day he and another IRA volunteer, who may have been Archie Doyle, were on Dublin's Dartry Road, opposite 'Woodpark Lodge', at the time the home of Se√°n Harling - a former IRA member who was an undercover police agent. Harling later claimed that upon his arrival home he noticed Coughlan and Doyle, that one of them shot at him, that he pulled his gun while running and shot back in self-defence, and that later he went out to investigate and found Coughlan's body lying in the street. His version was accepted by the tribunal which looked into the case, and he was not charged. However, the IRA claimed at the time - and many Irish nationalists continue to claim up to the present - that Coughlan was in fact ambushed and in effect extrajudicially executed. This version is especially supported by the autopsy carried out by Dr. Wilfred Lane which \\"amongst other anomalies, discovered that the IRA man died as a result of being shot in the back of his head\\". Also, the doctor found a cigarette butt in his mouth, which again indicated he had been caught unaware and killed, and tenants on Dartry Road testified that there had been unusual police activity that evening and that they heard more shots than mentioned in Harling's account. The Dublin IRA Brigade admitted that it did intend to murder Harling, who had betrayed IRA weapons dumps to the government and who - using his former Republican credentials - was agitating among IRA supporters and calling for \\"a change in the IRA leadership\\", allegedly on orders from his government \\"controller\\" David Neligan. However, the IRA claimed that Coughlan and Doyle had been engaged in preliminary surveillance only, and had no intention to attack Harling that evening. This is supported by the fact that, even according to Harling's version, they did not open fire until he noticed them - even though they were in place, at a location overlooking his house, before he arrived. Whatever the truth of the matter, in the wake of this affair Harling - feeling in danger of his life - asked and got Neligan's help in departing for America. He later returned to Ireland and joined the civil service.

He had had a long subsequent career in the organisation's ranks. War of Independence Doyle fought in the Irish War of Independence and took the anti-treaty side in the Irish Civil War, and was subsequently interned among numerous others. Together with two fellow-detainees ‚Äì Timothy Coughlin and Bill Gannon ‚Äì he took part in forming a secret \\"vengeance grouping\\".

Aftermath The three made their escape and were not apprehended. However, Timothy Coughlin was shot to death by police informer Sean Harling on the night of 28 January 1928, on Dublin's Dartry Road, under circumstances which remain controversial up to the present. A second IRA man is known to have been with Coughlin that night, in surveillance of Harling's home, and to have escaped unharmed. It is believed that Doyle was that second man, though this point ‚Äì as many other details of this still rather mysterious affair ‚Äì remains not quite certain. Doyle (as well as Gannon who died in 1965) was among the beneficiaries of the amnesty issued by √âamon de Valera when he came to power in 1932, under which numerous IRA men were released from prison and the charges against others dropped. In later times Doyle openly admitted his part in the killing of O'Higgins, and indeed took pride in it, without fear of prosecution. Split with de Valera and the 1940s campaign With the end of the IRA's alliance with de Valera and the increasing confrontation between them, Doyle ‚Äì now a veteran highly respected in the IRA circles ‚Äì became deeply involved in the organisation's 1940s campaigns. \\"Harry\\", the memoirs of IRA man Harry White, make repeated admiring references to \\"Archie Doyle of Dublin, the Tan War veteran who had fought through it all\\".All references to White's book are as quoted in Saoirse (Irish News), September 1992 During the IRA's Northern Campaign, Doyle is mentioned by White as having participated in the abortive raid on the British barracks at Crossmaglen, County Armagh, on 2 September 1942, in retaliation for the execution of Tom Williams earlier that morning. The IRA unit ‚Äì some twenty men in a commandeered lorry and accompanying car ‚Äì was discovered by a passing RUC patrol near the village of Cullaville. Doyle is mentioned in White's memoirs as having \\"jumped out of the car, Thompson in hand, and started shooting at the RUC\\". (Since the element of surprise was lost, the attack on the barracks had to be cancelled.) A week later, on 9 September, White mentions Archie Doyle as having commanded the assassination of Sergeant Denis O'Brien, Irish Special Branch detective and himself a former IRA man, near Dublin. It was a highly controversial affair, opposed by the IRA GHQ in Belfast as damaging to the Northern Campaign, and precipitating a massive manhunt by the Irish police. It was IRA Chief of Staff Charlie Kerins who was two years later caught, charged with the O'Brien assassination and eventually executed for it. White, however, claims that it was Doyle who actually commanded that action, on Kerins's orders. (Doyle, who openly spoke of his part in killing O'Higgins, seemed far more reticent about this part of his career). On 1 July 1943 Doyle is mentioned as having participated, together with Kerins and with Jackie Griffith ‚Äì both of them much younger men, who were only born when Doyle was already a full-fledged fighter against the British ‚Äì in an operation of \\"fund-raising\\" for the hard-pressed IRA (i.e., robbery). The three men arrived on bikes at the gates of Player Wills factory on the South Circular Road, Dublin, and with scarves around their faces stopped at gunpoint a van loaded with some ¬£5,000 for wages, and drove away with the van and the money (see ). Later life Griffith was shot down by the police in Dublin less than a week later, in what was charged to be an extrajudicial assassination, and Kerins ‚Äì as mentioned ‚Äì was caught in 1944 and executed, becoming a major IRA martyr. Doyle, however, continually survived decades of a very dangerous way of life and managed to die of old age. He died in St. James's Hospital in 1980.

It was part of the 2004 United States presidential election. Voters chose five representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Utah was won by incumbent President George W. Bush by a 45.5% margin of victory. Prior to the election, all 12 news organizations considered this a state Bush would win, or otherwise considered as a safe red state. It is a strongly Republican state that in 2004 had a state legislature with a \\"super-majority\\" of Republicans in its make-up (meaning the minority parties are unable to block a veto by its members), both U.S. Senators being Republican as well as two of the three members of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Mormons have been known for having very conservative values. While every county voted for Bush, areas such as Park City (ski resort), Moab (becoming an outpost for environmental activists), Carbon County (largely blue collar), Salt Lake City (urban area with some diversity) and San Juan County (economically distressed and mostly Native American) did give a number of their votes to Kerry. However, other areas were uniformly Republican in voting. Utah County's (home of Provo and Brigham Young University) Republican vote (86%) was by far the largest percentage of any county its size in America.

Utah is allocated five electors because it has three congressional districts and two senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of five electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins a plurality of votes in the state is awarded all five electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector. The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols. The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state.

It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (Site no. 33201). In 2013 it was added to the Heritage at Risk Register due to vulnerability to plant growth. The word trendle means circle, so it is a tautological place name.A Field Guide to Somerset Archaeology, Lesley and Roy Adkins (1992) page 114 The site, which covers , is surrounded by a single rampart with a ditch and has a simple opening on the East, uphill side. The hillside is steep and there are two areas which may have been more level platforms. It is situated on the slope of a hill which rises 130 m above the ring. Possible interpretations Both the period of construction and the original purpose of the earthwork are uncertain. It has been described at different times by different authorities as a fort, a settlement, a livestock enclosure and a hill-slope enclosure. It may have served different purposes at different times. It has never been excavated and no found artifacts are associated with it. The size of the 'ramparts' would argue for a defensive purpose, but the only entrance on the uphill side would not. The lack of any water supply would argue against any permanent human occupation and against its use as a livestock enclosure, although two more level areas inside the earthwork have been identified as possible building platforms. Hill-slope enclosures are found in South West England dating from the first and second millennium BC. When excavated, they have sometimes been found to have had settlements inside them, resembling defensible farmsteads, but the extreme steepness of this site and its location halfway up the scarp of the Quantocks make it difficult to assign it a purely practical purpose.

IRA career and the O'Higgins Assassination  Gannon had fought in the Irish War of Independence. In the Irish Civil War he took the anti-treaty side and was among the force which seized the Four Courts in Dublin. After the defeat of his side he spent a considerable time under internment together with numerous others. He was completely unreconciled to the victory of the \\"Free Staters\\", and together with two fellow-detainees ‚Äì Archie Doyle and Timothy Coughlin ‚Äì took part in forming a secret \\"vengeance grouping\\". The three vowed that once free of imprisonment they would take revenge on their opponents, whom they considered traitors to the Irish cause. Most such private revenge pacts were broken up by the IRA leadership when it reorganised following 1924, but Gannon and his two fellow conspirators persisted and carried through their deadly aim. The act which first made Gannon (and the two others) well-known was the assassination of Justice Minister Kevin O'Higgins. On Sunday 10 July 1927, the three surprised O'Higgins on the Booterstown Avenue side of Cross Avenue in Blackrock, County Dublin and shot him down. O'Higgins was especially hated by IRA members for having ordered the executions of seventy-seven of their fellows during the Civil War, an act for which he outspokenly took responsibility and refused to express any remorse. Moreover, he was a dominant member of the Free State government and the conspirators had good reasons to believe that his death would weaken it. None of the three was ever apprehended or charged with the assassination, though Coughlin was killed by a police informer in 1928 under circumstances which remain controversial up to the present. Gannon and Doyle benefited from the amnesty for IRA members issued by √âamon de Valera on his accession to power in 1932, and after that date they could openly admit their part in assassinating O'Higgins without fear of being prosecuted. Communist career and the Spanish Civil War By that time, Gannon had already turned to the Left and became a leading member of the Communist Party of Ireland when it was refounded in 1933. In this decision may have been influenced by Donal O'Reilly, his lifelong companion who had been with him at the Four Courts and who already joined the Communist Party in its earlier incarnation under Roddy Connolly. The radical left-wing commentator Jack ClearyJack Cleary, \\"From militarists to Marxists?\\" in Workers' Liberty magazine, x2 March 2005 approvingly mentions Bill Gannon as among the few IRA militants who had \\"given up the gun in favor of working-class politics\\" (in marked contrast to Gannon's aforementioned fellow-assassin Archie Doyle, who continued to take part in IRA armed raids well into the 1940s). Being an Irish Communist in these years carried, however, its own risks. Gannon is mentioned as having been among the defenders of Connolly House, the party's Dublin headquarters, when it was attacked ‚Äì and ultimately put on fire ‚Äì by a right-wing mob in 1933. And in subsequent years Communists continued to suffer constant harassment, often descending into outright violence. Gannon is at present mainly remembered for his major part in organising Irish volunteers (the Connolly Column) to fight on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, a work undertaken in close co-operation with Frank Ryan and Peadar O'Donnell, and which came to overshadow his earlier fame (or notoriety) in connection with the O'Higgins assassination. Some official Communist versions of his life conspicuously omit altogether any mention of O'Higgins, such as the following: > In September 1936, the decision was taken to form an Irish unit for the > Spanish Republican Army. The Communist Party of Ireland gave the task of > recruitment and organisation to Bill Gannon, a Party member who had > considerable experience of political work in the Irish Republican Army and > been decorated with an Irish Governmental Medal for his distinguished record > in the Irish national struggle.\\"Ireland\\" chapter in \\"International > Solidarity with the Spanish Republic 1936‚Äì1939\\", Produced by the Academy of > Sciences of the USSR, Institute of the International Working-Class Movement, > Soviet War Veterans' Committee, published by Progress Publishers, Moscow, > (second printing 1976) ‚Äì reproduced on the \\"Ireland and The Spanish Civil > War\\" website Gannon died on 12 September 1965, age 63, and got a well-attended party funeral, his coffin being draped with the Hammer and Sickle flag.

Leveille, Appellants v. Internal Revenue Service and United States of America, Appellees (commonly known as Murphy v. IRS), is a controversial tax case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit originally held that the taxation of emotional distress awards by the federal government is unconstitutional. That decision was vacated, or rendered void,To vacate, in the context of a court's action on a judgment, means \\"to render void; to set aside\\". Barron's Law Dictionary, p. 503 (2d ed. 1984). by the Court on December 22, 2006. The Court eventually overturned its original decision, finding against Murphy in an opinion issued on July 3, 2007. The July 3, 2007 decision was that the taxpayer's recovery could be taxed under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution even if the recovery were not \\"income\\" under the Sixteenth Amendment. The Court conceded that this rationale for granting a rehearing and overturning the original decision was not in the government's original appeal, and would not normally have been considered under the Court's rules. The Court indicated that the issue was of such importance, affecting \\"the broad public interest\\", that the new argument could be entertained. The original decision The Court had issued its original opinion, written by Chief Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg and joined by Judges Judith Rogers and Janice Rogers Brown, on August 22, 2006. The opinion had struck down to the extent that the statute purported to categorize compensatory damages for emotional distress and loss of reputation as being includible in gross income for Federal income tax purposes. Marrita Murphy was represented by David K. Colapinto of the law firm Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto, who also handled her appeal before the D.C. Circuit. Murphy had sued to recover income taxes that she paid on the compensatory damages for emotional distress and loss of reputation that she was awarded in an action against her former employer under whistle-blower statutes for reporting environmental hazards on her former employer's property to state authorities. Murphy had claimed both physical and emotional-distress damages as a result of her former employer's retaliation and mistreatment. In a prior administrative proceeding, Murphy had been awarded compensatory damages of $70,000, of which $45,000 was for \\"emotional distress or mental anguish\\" and $25,000 was for \\"injury to professional reputation.\\" Murphy reported the $70,000 award as part of her \\"gross income\\" and paid $20,665 in Federal income taxes based upon the award. Section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code excludes, from gross income, amounts \\"received . . . on account of personal physical injuries.\\"(a)(2). The statute provides that for purposes of that exclusion, \\"emotional distress shall not be treated as a physical injury or physical sickness.\\" Based on that provision, Murphy sought a refund of the full amount of tax, arguing that the award should be exempt from taxation both because the award was \\"in fact\\" to compensate for \\"physical personal injuries\\" and because the award was not \\"income\\" within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment.Murphy, 460 F.3d at 81-82. Interpreting Section 104(a)(2), the D.C. Circuit first held in August 2006 that the damages at issue did not fall within the scope of the statute because the damages were not in fact to compensate for \\"personal physical injuries,\\" and thus could not be excluded from gross income under that provision.Murphy, 460 F.3d at 83-84. The D.C. Circuit next analyzed whether Section 104(a)(2) is \\"constitutional,\\" relying upon language from Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.. to the effect that, under the Sixteenth Amendment, Congress may \\"tax all gains\\" or \\"accessions to wealth.\\"Murphy, 460 F.3d at 85. Murphy argued that her award was neither a gain nor an accession to wealth because it compensated her for nonphysical injuries, and was thus effectively a restoration of \\"human capital.\\" Recognizing that the Supreme Court has long held that a restoration of capital \\"[i]s not income,\\" and thus is not taxable, and that personal injury recoveries have traditionally been considered \\"nontaxable on the theory that they roughly correspond to a return of capital,\\" the D.C. Circuit accepted Murphy's argument in its August 2006 decision.Murphy, 460 F.3d at 84 (quoting, inter alia, , Glenshaw Glass, 348 U.S. at 432 n.8). The D.C. Circuit reasoned that Murphy's award for emotional distress or loss of reputation is not taxable because her damages \\"were awarded to make Murphy emotionally and reputationally 'whole' and not to compensate her for lost wages or taxable earnings of any kind.\\"Murphy, 460 F.3d at 88. The D.C. Circuit also explained that a 1918 opinion of the Attorney General stating that proceeds from an accident insurance policy were not taxable income and a 1922 IRS ruling that damages based on loss of reputation were not taxable income, both issued relatively near the Sixteenth Amendment's ratification in 1913, support its ruling.Murphy, 460 F.3d at 86, 89. The D.C. Circuit thus concluded that \\"the framers of the Sixteenth Amendment would not have understood compensation for a personal injury ‚Äì including a nonphysical injury ‚Äì to be income.\\"Murphy, 460 F.3d at 92. Murphy's position was that her award constituted only monies that \\"made her whole\\" and, in effect, was a return of her \\"human capital.\\" Judgment vacated The Department of Justice asked for a rehearing en banc (i.e., a hearing before all the members of the Court, rather than before only the panel of three judges who made the original decision). The original three judges then agreed to rehear the case themselves. The original August 2006 judgment, which had been mandatory precedent only in the District of Columbia, was vacated. Rehearing and decision The parties presented oral arguments in a rehearing on April 23, 2007,Docket, case no. 05-5139, unnumbered entry on April 23, 2007, Murphy v. Internal Revenue Service, United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On July 3, 2007, the Court ruled (1) that the taxpayer's compensation was received on account of a non-physical injury or sickness; (2) that gross income under section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code. does include compensatory damages for non-physical injuries, even if the award is not an \\"accession to wealth,\\" (3) that the income tax imposed on an award for non-physical injuries is an indirect tax, regardless of whether the recovery is restoration of \\"human capital,\\" and therefore the tax does not violate the constitutional requirement of Article I, section 9, that capitations or other direct taxes must be laid among the states only in proportion to the population; (4) that the income tax imposed on an award for non-physical injuries does not violate the constitutional requirement of Article I, section 8, that all duties, imposts and excises be uniform throughout the United States; (5) that under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the Internal Revenue Service may not be sued in its own name. The Court stated: \\"[a]lthough the 'Congress cannot make a thing income which is not so in fact,' [ . . . ] it can label a thing income and tax it, so long as it acts within its constitutional authority, which includes not only the Sixteenth Amendment but also Article I, Sections 8 and 9.\\" Citing Commissioner v. Banks, the court noted that \\"the power of the Congress to tax income 'extends broadly to all economic gains.'\\"Murphy, 493 F.3d at 177 (quoting ). The court ruled that Ms. Murphy was not entitled to the tax refund she claimed, and that the personal injury award she received was \\"within the reach of the congressional power to tax under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution\\"‚Äîeven if the award was \\"not income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment\\".  Appeal of July 2007 decision  Murphy's attorneys, led by David K. Colapinto of Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto, requested a rehearing of the July 2007 decision by the full Court of Appeals (en banc) for the District of Columbia Circuit, which was denied on September 14, 2007. On December 17, 2007, Murphy filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court asking for a review of the decision of the Court of Appeals.Docket, Murphy v.

From 1990 to 1998 he was a member of Australia's prominent world class crew - the coxless four known as the Oarsome Foursome. Club and state rowing McKay commenced his rowing at Xavier College in Kew, Melbourne. His senior club rowing was from the Mercantile Rowing Club. McKay was selected in Victorian state representative King's Cup crews contesting the men's Interstate Eight-Oared Championship at the Australian Rowing Championships on eighteen occasions from 1986 to 2004. McKay was in winning Victorian King's Cup crews on fifteen occasions. International representative rowing McKay's first national representative selection was to the 1985 Match des Seniors in Banyoles Spain - then the equivalent of today's World Rowing U23 Championships. McKay rowed in the Australian men's eight to a silver medal. That same crew represented Australia in the men's eight selected for the 1985 Trans-Tasman U/23 regatta held on Lake Ruataniwha New Zealand. His first senior national call up was to the 1986 World Rowing Championships in Nottingham, England where he rowed the four seat in the Australian men's eight to victory. It was Australia's first and only World Championship title in the men's VIII. That same year at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, in that same crew McKay won gold in the Australian men's VIII. McKay also rowed in a coxed four to a bronze medal at those same games. In 1990, McKay, with Nick Green, Samuel Patten, James Tomkins were selected race as Australia's coxless four. Their success was immediate. They won the 1990 and 1991 World Rowing Championships. And with Andrew Cooper replacing Samuel Patten, they followed up with a gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. The crew's success gained them the nickname Oarsome Foursome. The boat repeated its Gold medal performance at the 1996 Summer Olympics, this time with Drew Ginn replacing Andrew Cooper. At the 1998 World Rowing Championships, McKay, with the other members of the Oarsome Foursome, teamed to win the coxless four. At those same championships McKay with Drew Ginn placed second in the coxless pair. In 1999 the foursome tried out but lost the 1999 Australian selection trials as a coxless four. Nick Green retired, Tomkins and Ginn decided to switch to the coxless pairs, and McKay tried out for the Australian eight which ended up finishing seventh at the World Championships. In 2000 the Australian eight qualified for the Olympics and raced at two Rowing World Cups in the lead up campaign as well as at the Henley Royal Regatta where they raced as an Australian Institute of Sport eight and won that year's Grand Challenge Cup. At Sydney 2000 with McKay in the bow seat, the Australian eight won their heat in a pace that blew away the eventual gold medallists Great Britain. However, in the final they started slowly and their late sprint home left them 0.8 seconds behind the Brits at the line and to take the silver Olympic medal in a thrilling finish.McKay at World Rowing McKay was again in the Australian eight for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. The boat finished third behind the United States and the Netherlands. Accolades In 1993, McKay and the other members of his 1992 Olympic boat were awarded the Order of Australia. In 2007 he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame.Hall of Fame and that same year the International Rowing Federation awarded McKay the Thomas Keller Medal for his outstanding international rowing career. It is the sport's highest honor and is awarded within five years of the athlete's retirement, acknowledging an exceptional career and exemplary sportsmanship.

This marked the end of the Anglo-French Alliance that dominated Europe since the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, replacing it with the Anglo-Austrian Alliance. After Spain signed on 22 July 1731, Austria recognised Charles of Spain as Duke of Parma and Piacenza.  Background  Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria. The period after the 1713 Peace of Utrecht was one of constant re-alignment among the European Powers as they attempted to solve issues without war. France in particular needed peace to rebuild its exhausted economy after the War of the Spanish Succession, which resulted in the 1716 Anglo-French Alliance. Although both sides were suspicious of each other, the succession of George I in 1714 and his concern for Hanover made the alliance more important to Britain than was previously the case. Utrecht confirmed Philip V as the first Bourbon king of Spain but left Britain in possession of the Spanish ports of Gibraltar and Mah√≥n, Menorca, captured during the war. Regaining these was a priority for the new regime. Spain also ceded their Italian possessions of Naples, Sicily, Milan and Sardinia. These became a focus for Spanish foreign policy largely due to Elisabeth Farnese, Philip's second wife. When they married in 1714, he already had two sons and she wanted to create an Italian inheritance for her own children. Commercial issues included the Austrian-owned Ostend Company, which competed for the East Indies trade with British, French and Dutch merchants, as well as Spanish concerns over British incursions in New Spain. As the 1730s began, Emperor Charles VI of Austria needed support for the 1713 Pragmatic Sanction and ensure the succession of his daughter Maria Theresa. The result was an almost continuous series of conferences and agreements, among them the 1725 Peace of Vienna between Austria and Spain. This alignment was short-lived, Charles VI deciding Austria's interests were better served by an alliance with Britain and the Dutch Republic. Details  Charles of Spain ca 1730; Austria accepted him as Duke of Parma In the 1720 Treaty of The Hague, Britain, France, the Dutch Republic and Austria recognised Charles of Spain, third son of Philip V, as Duke of Parma and Tuscany. Although reconfirmed by Britain and France in the 1729 Treaty of Seville, Austria refused to comply and occupied the Duchy when Antonio Farnese died in January 1731. The Treaty agreed to withdraw these and Charles of Spain was installed as Duke. The Austrian-backed Ostend East India Company was also closed; established in 1722, this had become a major competitor to the British and Dutch East India companies. Emperor Charles VI revoked the Company's charter in 1727 to ensure acceptance of the Pragmatic Sanction but Britain made its permanent closure a condition of signing the Treaty. Aftermath During the 1733 to 1735 War of the Polish Succession, Charles of Spain seized the former Spanish possession of the Kingdom of Naples. As a result, the 1738 Treaty of Vienna returned Parma and Piacenza to Emperor Charles VI, until his death in 1740 led to the War of the Austrian Succession. The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la- Chapelle transferred Parma to Charles of Spain's younger brother Philip; Charles succeeded his elder brother Ferdinand VI as king of Spain in 1759. The Anglo-Austrian alliance lasted until the 1756 Diplomatic Revolution led to a realignment of relationships; the most significant was long-time rivals France and Austria becoming allies.

Adler arrived in the United States in 1833 and graduated valedictorianDictionary of American Biography, pg 107. from New York University in 1844. In 1846, he became a professor of modern languages at New York University. In 1849, he compiled the Dictionary of German and English Languages, whose publication marked Adler as one of the great linguists of his era. In 1858, Adler completed his last important work, A Practical Grammar of the Latin Language. Both of these textbooks are in effect editions of the language textbooks of Heinrich Gottfried Ollendorff. Regarding his important work on the Latin, Adler writes in the preface to the textbook: \\"The preparation of a text-book for the study of the Latin, similar to that edited by me, some twelve years ago, on the German, has since that time been repeatedly suggested to me ‚Ä¶ Years however elapsed before I could even think of entering on such a task, ‚Ä¶ partly because I felt, in common with many others, some hesitation to undertake the somewhat delicate part of treating a so-called dead language like a living organism ‚Ä¶ It was not until after I had completed what I considered myself bound to render, as professor of a modern language in the city of New York, that I could give the question a serious consideration.\\" Adler had been diagnosed as insane, reportedly due to the strain of publishing the dictionary. He became a resident of the Bloomingdale Asylum in upper Manhattan in 1853, remaining a semi-permanent resident of the facility until his death there in 1868. Adler is buried at Trinity Cemetery. He wrote a short tract about his insanity, called Letters of a Lunatic.Letters of a Lunatic, a brief exposition of my University Life during the years 1853‚Äì54. (1854) Adler was known to Herman Melville, whom he met on a sea journey to Europe in October 1849. This was shortly before Melville wrote Moby Dick. Melville wrote of that encounter: \\"He is author of a formidable lexicon (German and English); in compiling which he almost ruined his health. He was almost crazy, he tells me, for a time. He is full of the German metaphysics, and discourses of Kant, Swedenborg, etc.\\" Melville spent many hours talking to Adler, talking of \\"Fixed Fate, Free will, foreknowledge and the absolute\\", said Melville, \\"his philosophy is Coleredgian [sic], he accepts the scriptures as divine, and yet leaves himself free to inquire into nature. He does not take it that the Bible is absolutely infallible and that anything opposed to it in Science must be wrong. He believes that there are things out of God and independent [sic] of him ‚Äì things that would have existed were there no God ‚Äì such as that two and two make four; for it is not that God so decrees mathematically, but that in the very nature of things, the fact is thus.\\" Further, Leon Howard points out that Adler may well serve as the model for Bartleby in Melville's Bartleby, the Scrivener, a story of Wall Street. \\"On 25 August Melville was excused from work for the funeral of George Adler, whose body was buried at the rapidly filling Trinity Cemetery, after a funeral at St. Michael's Church. Melville was one of only a handful of mourners at the funeral. When he was earning no money, in late 1859 or early 1860, and before Lizzie inherited money, Melville had subscribed for a copy of Adler's translation of a book on Proven√ßal poetry ‚Äì the test of friendship. Most of the intervening years Adler had remained confined at Bloomingdale's Asylum. Duyckinck was there at the funeral, riding from St. Michael's with the Dr. Houghton who was conducting part of the service. It was a sorry affair, a man of genius living in confinement and dying almost unmourned, Duyckinck recorded in a letter to his son George. \\"Herman Melville, [F. W.] Downer with me & two others were at the funeral, and Dr. [D. Tilden] Brown of the asylum in whose face and mien you may read the secret of Adler's regard for him.\\" At least the staff physician had been one of the mourners.\\"Hershel Parker's definitive biography of Melville.

In 1905, Robert Swan was suffering from rheumatism and needed a place to calm his pain and be comfortable. The two brothers set out to find the hot springs. It took them a little over a month to reach the hot springs after searching for it in Interior Alaska‚Äôs harsh landscape. In 1911, twelve small cabins were built to accommodate visitors. The twelve cabins developed, and they became one of the most famous resorts in the interior of Alaska. The Chena Hot Springs became so famous that the United States Department of Agriculture sent chemists to analyze the water.

A schematic illustration of a SHWFS. Operations of a single lenslet in a SHWFS. A Shack‚ÄìHartmann (or Hartmann‚ÄìShack) wavefront sensor (SHWFS) is an optical instrument used for characterizing an imaging system. It is a wavefront sensor commonly used in adaptive optics systems. It consists of an array of lenses (called lenslets) of the same focal length. Each is focused onto a photon sensor (typically a CCD array or CMOS array or quad-cell ). If the sensor is placed at the geometric focal plane of the lenslet, and is uniformly illuminated, then, the integrated gradient of the wavefront across the lenslet is proportional to the displacement of the centroid. Consequently, any phase aberration can be approximated by a set of discrete tilts. By sampling the wavefront with an array of lenslets, all of these local tilts can be measured and the whole wavefront reconstructed. Since only tilts are measured the Shack‚ÄìHartmann cannot detect discontinuous steps in the wavefront. The design of this sensor improves upon an array of holes in a mask that had been developed in 1900 by Johannes Franz Hartmann as a means of tracing individual rays of light through the optical system of a large telescope, thereby testing the quality of the image. In the late 1960s, Roland Shack and Ben Platt modified the Hartmann screen by replacing the apertures in an opaque screen by an array of lenslets. The terminology as proposed by Shack and Platt was Hartmann screen. The fundamental principle seems to be documented even before Huygens by the Jesuit philosopher, Christopher Scheiner, in Austria.Scheiner, \\"Oculus, sive fundamentum opticum\\", Innsbruck 1619 Shack‚ÄìHartmann sensors are used in astronomy to measure telescopes and in medicine to characterize eyes for corneal treatment of complex refractive errors. Recently, Pamplona et al. developed and patented an inverse of the Shack‚ÄìHartmann system to measure one's eye lens aberrations. While Shack‚ÄìHartmann sensors measure the localized slope of the wavefront error using spot displacement in the sensor plane, Pamplona et al. replace the sensor plane with a high resolution visual display (e.g. a mobile phone screen) that displays spots that the user views through a lenslet array. The user then manually shifts the displayed spots (i.e. the generated wavefront) until the spots align. The magnitude of this shift provides data to estimate the first-order parameters such as radius of curvature and hence error due to defocus and spherical aberration.

Disk encryption uses disk encryption software or hardware to encrypt every bit of data that goes on a disk or disk volume. It is used to prevent unauthorized access to data storage. Expressions full disk encryption (FDE) or whole disk encryption signify that everything on the disk is encrypted, but the master boot record (MBR), or similar area of a bootable disk, with code that starts the operating system loading sequence, is not encrypted. Some hardware-based full disk encryption systems can truly encrypt an entire boot disk, including the MBR.  Transparent encryption  Transparent encryption, also known as real-time encryption and on-the-fly encryption (OTFE), is a method used by some disk encryption software. \\"Transparent\\" refers to the fact that data is automatically encrypted or decrypted as it is loaded or saved. With transparent encryption, the files are accessible immediately after the key is provided, and the entire volume is typically mounted as if it were a physical drive, making the files just as accessible as any unencrypted ones. No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read (decrypted) without using the correct password/keyfile(s) or correct encryption keys. The entire file system within the volume is encrypted (including file names, folder names, file contents, and other meta-data). To be transparent to the end-user, transparent encryption usually requires the use of device drivers to enable the encryption process. Although administrator access rights are normally required to install such drivers, encrypted volumes can typically be used by normal users without these rights. In general, every method in which data is seamlessly encrypted on write and decrypted on read, in such a way that the user and/or application software remains unaware of the process, can be called transparent encryption.  Disk encryption vs. filesystem-level encryption  Disk encryption does not replace file encryption in all situations. Disk encryption is sometimes used in conjunction with filesystem-level encryption with the intention of providing a more secure implementation. Since disk encryption generally uses the same key for encrypting the whole drive, all data is decryptable when the system runs. However, some disk encryption solutions use multiple keys for encrypting different volumes. If an attacker gains access to the computer at run-time, the attacker has access to all files. Conventional file and folder encryption instead allows different keys for different portions of the disk. Thus an attacker cannot extract information from still-encrypted files and folders. Unlike disk encryption, filesystem-level encryption does not typically encrypt filesystem metadata, such as the directory structure, file names, modification timestamps or sizes. Disk encryption and Trusted Platform Module Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a secure cryptoprocessor embedded in the motherboard that can be used to authenticate a hardware device. Since each TPM chip is unique to a particular device, it is capable of performing platform authentication. It can be used to verify that the system seeking the access is the expected system. A limited number of disk encryption solutions have support for TPM. These implementations can wrap the decryption key using the TPM, thus tying the hard disk drive (HDD) to a particular device. If the HDD is removed from that particular device and placed in another, the decryption process will fail. Recovery is possible with the decryption password or token. Although this has the advantage that the disk cannot be removed from the device, it might create a single point of failure in the encryption. For example, if something happens to the TPM or the motherboard, a user would not be able to access the data by connecting the hard drive to another computer, unless that user has a separate recovery key.  Implementations  There are multiple tools available in the market that allow for disk encryption. However, they vary greatly in features and security. They are divided into three main categories: software-based, hardware-based within the storage device, and hardware-based elsewhere (such as CPU or host bus adaptor). Hardware-based full disk encryption within the storage device are called self-encrypting drives and have no impact on performance whatsoever. Furthermore, the media-encryption key never leaves the device itself and is therefore not available to any virus in the operating system. The Trusted Computing Group Opal Storage Specification provides industry accepted standardization for self-encrypting drives. External hardware is considerably faster than the software-based solutions although CPU versions may still have a performance impact, and the media encryption keys are not as well protected. All solutions for the boot drive require a pre-boot authentication component which is available for all types of solutions from a number of vendors. It is important in all cases that the authentication credentials are usually a major potential weakness since the symmetric cryptography is usually strong. Password/data recovery mechanism Secure and safe recovery mechanisms are essential to the large-scale deployment of any disk encryption solutions in an enterprise. The solution must provide an easy but secure way to recover passwords (most importantly data) in case the user leaves the company without notice or forgets the password. Challenge‚Äìresponse password recovery mechanism Challenge‚Äìresponse password recovery mechanism allows the password to be recovered in a secure manner. It is offered by a limited number of disk encryption solutions. Some benefits of challenge‚Äìresponse password recovery: # No need for the user to carry a disc with recovery encryption key. # No secret data is exchanged during the recovery process. # No information can be sniffed. # Does not require a network connection, i.e. it works for users that are at a remote location. Emergency recovery information (ERI)-file password recovery mechanism An emergency recovery information (ERI) file provides an alternative for recovery if a challenge‚Äìresponse mechanism is unfeasible due to the cost of helpdesk operatives for small companies or implementation challenges. Some benefits of ERI-file recovery: # Small companies can use it without implementation difficulties. # No secret data is exchanged during the recovery process. # No information can be sniffed. # Does not require a network connection, i.e. it works for users that are at a remote location. Security concerns Most full disk encryption schemes are vulnerable to a cold boot attack, whereby encryption keys can be stolen by cold-booting a machine already running an operating system, then dumping the contents of memory before the data disappears. The attack relies on the data remanence property of computer memory, whereby data bits can take up to several minutes to degrade after power has been removed. Even a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is not effective against the attack, as the operating system needs to hold the decryption keys in memory in order to access the disk. Full disk encryption is also vulnerable when a computer is stolen when suspended. As wake-up does not involve a BIOS boot sequence, it typically does not ask for the FDE password. Hibernation, in contrast goes via a BIOS boot sequence, and is safe. All software-based encryption systems are vulnerable to various side channel attacks such as acoustic cryptanalysis and hardware keyloggers. In contrast, self-encrypting drives are not vulnerable to these attacks since the hardware encryption key never leaves the disk controller. Also, most of full disk encryption schemes don't protect from data tampering (or silent data corruption, i.e. bitrot). That means they only provide privacy, but not integrity. Block cipher-based encryption modes used for full disk encryption are not authenticated encryption themselves because of concerns of the storage overhead needed for authentication tags. Thus, if tampering would be done to data on the disk, the data would be decrypted to garbled random data when read and hopefully errors may be indicated depending on which data is tampered with (for the case of OS metadata ‚Äì by the file system; and for the case of file data ‚Äì by the corresponding program that would process the file). One of the ways to mitigate these concerns, is to use file systems with full data integrity checks via checksums (like Btrfs or ZFS) on top of full disk encryption. However, cryptsetup started experimentally to support authenticated encryption Full disk encryption Benefits Full disk encryption has several benefits compared to regular file or folder encryption, or encrypted vaults. The following are some benefits of disk encryption: # Nearly everything including the swap space and the temporary files is encrypted. Encrypting these files is important, as they can reveal important confidential data. With a software implementation, the bootstrapping code cannot be encrypted however. For example, BitLocker Drive Encryption leaves an unencrypted volume to boot from, while the volume containing the operating system is fully encrypted. # With full disk encryption, the decision of which individual files to encrypt is not left up to users' discretion. This is important for situations in which users might not want or might forget to encrypt sensitive files. # Immediate data destruction, such as simply destroying the cryptographic keys (crypto-shredding), renders the contained data useless. However, if security towards future attacks is a concern, purging or physical destruction is advised.  The boot key problem  One issue to address in full disk encryption is that the blocks where the operating system is stored must be decrypted before the OS can boot, meaning that the key has to be available before there is a user interface to ask for a password. Most Full Disk Encryption solutions utilize Pre-Boot Authentication by loading a small, highly secure operating system which is strictly locked down and hashed versus system variables to check for the integrity of the Pre- Boot kernel. Some implementations such as BitLocker Drive Encryption can make use of hardware such as a Trusted Platform Module to ensure the integrity of the boot environment, and thereby frustrate attacks that target the boot loader by replacing it with a modified version. This ensures that authentication can take place in a controlled environment without the possibility of a bootkit being used to subvert the pre-boot decryption. With a pre-boot authentication environment, the key used to encrypt the data is not decrypted until an external key is input into the system. Solutions for storing the external key include: * Username / password * Using a smartcard in combination with a PIN * Using a biometric authentication method such as a fingerprint * Using a dongle to store the key, assuming that the user will not allow the dongle to be stolen with the laptop or that the dongle is encrypted as well * Using a boot-time driver that can ask for a password from the user * Using a network interchange to recover the key, for instance as part of a PXE boot * Using a TPM to store the decryption key, preventing unauthorized access of the decryption key or subversion of the boot loader * Using a combination of the above All these possibilities have varying degrees of security; however, most are better than an unencrypted disk.

A Declaration and Programme of Action was directed, aimed at initiating a long- term strategy to deal with Africa's four million refugees and returnees. Going beyond the first International Conference (ICARA I, Geneva, 1981), which focussed primarily on emergency assistance, ICARA II linked humanitarian aid to refugees with the need to help host countries develop their social and economic infrastructures. It was hoped that international agreement could be found to fund the cost of supporting refugees, only for the meeting to be largely considered a failure. It was also hoped that the major outcome of this meeting would be the voluntary repatriation of refugees to their homeland. This agreement was based on the thesis that it is cheaper for the donor nations to have the refugee reintegrate with their home nation then to have to support them continually, creating a \\"welfare system\\" for refugees.

It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Background Plainsfield Camp Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated \\"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war.

The story first appeared in a 1951 edition of the anthology New Tales of Space and Time and was reprinted in the collection Nightfall and Other Stories (1969). The book betins with an epigram: \\"In a good cause, there are no failures. There are only delayed successes.\\" Plot summary The story opens with a description of a statue on the grounds of the United Worlds organisation raised to Richard \\"Dick\\" Altmayer. It displays a quote and three dates, which correspond to the three days upon which he was arrested for his beliefs. The first is in the year 2755 of the \\"Atomic Era\\" (corresponding to 4700 AD in Asimovean chronology). Altmayer and his friend Geoffrey Stock have opposing positions when conscripted into military service for a war between human-occupied star systems. Stock willingly reports for military duty, whilst Altmayer protests, believing that the various interstellar nations of humanity should be united against the Diaboli, an intelligent non-human race that also occupies several planetary systems in the galaxy. Over a 45-year period, Stock reaches high military rank and then political office, whilst Altmayer is imprisoned and kept under house arrest several times for his radical idealism. He starts political parties and protest movements, all of which fail to achieve their objectives of uniting humanity. Ultimately, Altmayer's desire for a united humanity is achieved after a war against the Diaboli. This unity, however, has been realised only through Stock's political manipulations rather than Altmayer's idealistic actions. Stock asks his one-time friend to be one of the delegates from Earth to a peace conference, but realizes that history will not record his own participation in the unification of humanity, but will instead vilify him as a cruel and short-sighted politician.

Family Andrews was born in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, the son of John Andrews and Charlotte. On 27 March 1855, Solomon married Mary Asher (20 August 1832 ‚Äì 18 January 1870), daughter of John and Mary Asher, in Trinity Church, Trowbridge. There were five children from the marriage but only two survived infancy: * Mary Lillah Asher Andrews (24 June 1857) married John McRae June 1880 in Cardiff and she died 13 Mar 1929 *Francis Emile Andrews (29 September 1858 ‚Äì 30 November 1943) His second wife, whom he married on 15 June 1870 in Knighton Parish Church, was Mary Jane Udell (born 2 March 1849) of Wrexham.Wiltshire Times, 14 November 1908 There were six children from this marriage: *Beatrice Andrews (6 April 1871) *Herbert Fletcher Andrews (16 April 1873 ‚Äì 8 June 1874) *Florence Andrews *May Andrews, married William Edgar Clogg *Daisy Andrews *Sydney Solomon Andrews (26 February 1885) Career By 1851 Andrews was living in Cardiff, at 17 Tredegar Street, and working as a baker and confectioner.The Wiltshire archaeological and natural history magazine: Volume 36, Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society ‚Äì 1910 The house was owned by George and Charlotte Asher, George being a baker and confectioner, so Solomon was presumably learning the trade. On 24 November 1856 he leased a shop and house at 51 James Street. On 17 December 1863Keep Moving. The Story of Solomon Andrews and His Family, John F. Andrews, November 1976. he obtained a licence to operate a horse-drawn cab from the new residential districts of Canton and Roath to Cardiff Docks. By 1865, he had eight cabs and he is thought to have been an omnibus proprietor by December 1866. His business interests grew rapidly to include tramways, buses, draperies and collieries. His son Francis Emile (1858‚Äì1943) joined the company and eventually became a partner, the business becoming known as Solomon Andrews and Son, Andrews was a Conservative councillor on Cardiff Town Council, but lost his Roath ward seat at the 1887 elections. Transport Buses Star Omnibus Company horse bus at the 2010 Cobham bus rally He was best known for the Andrews Star Omnibus Company and the Star Omnibus Company (London) which provided horse-drawn bus services in London. His company also ran buses in: *Belfast *Leicester *Manchester *Nottingham Trams *Cardiff *Plymouth *Portsmouth ‚Äì Portsmouth Street Tramways Company *Pwllheli ‚Äì Pwllheli and Llanbedrog Tramway *Arthog ‚Äì Barmouth Junction and Arthog Tramway Property Arthog Mawddach Crescent St Mary's Terrace, Arthog Arthog Terrace In 1894 he purchased an area near Arthog consisting of several farms. He developed three terraces of houses, including St Mary's Terrace, Arthog Terrace, and Mawddach Crescent. Mawddach Crescent was a row of properties overlooking the Mawddach estuary. The Crescent was connected to Barmouth Junction railway station by the short-lived Barmouth Junction and Arthog Tramway which he constructed. Andrews intended this to be the start of a purpose-built holiday resort but the surrounding land proved unsuitable for further construction. In 1941, during the Second World War, the Crescent was commandeered by the Royal Marines. It was renamed Camp Iceland and used as a training facility. St Mary's Terrace in Arthog was also served by the Barmouth Junction and Arthog Tramway. Aberdyfi Andrews purchased land here and started work by fencing off some of it. However, this provoked trouble locally as public rights of way were affected, so no development ever took place. The land was later sold to the local authority. Cardiff Andrews undertook the rebuilding of 10 Bute Street (now Hayes Bridge Road) in 1871. This building was intended to be a grocery and confectionery shop and the headquarters of the Solomon Andrews and Son firm. In the 1870s the expansion of his omnibus business led to the acquisition of new sites for depots. A freehold site was purchased at Severn Road, Canton, in 1875, and a manager's house, bus shed, stables and workshops was constructed. In 1875, he also undertook work on a leasehold site at Glebe Street, Penarth. In 1880 he built a tram car depot at the junction of Ferry Road and Clive Street, Grangetown. This was for the Cardiff District and Penarth Harbour Tramway Company which opened in 1881. Between 1881‚Äì83 Andrews built five houses and shops, five cottages and Windsor Hall in Holmesdale Street, and some houses in Earl Street. Andrews Terrace in Ferry Road, consisting of sixteen houses and a coffee tavern, was also constructed at around the same time. In 1884 he constructed the Market Buildings in St Mary Street, Cardiff at a cost of some ¬£12,000. Sadly this building was destroyed by fire in June 1885, and it had been replaced by September 1886,The Pictorial World, 9 December 1886 the new building being constructed with eight-inch-thick concrete flooring to prevent further fires. In 1885 in James Street he began construction of Mercantile Buildings which survived until demolished in the 1970s during a road widening scheme. In 1888 Andrews completed the Imperial Buildings on St Mary Street, Cardiff, which became known as Barry's Hotel. He also built two streets of housing which were named Mary Street and Solomon Street (later renamed Andrews Road), and was involved in the construction of warehouses on the southern side of Penarth Road, as well as between Crawshay Lane (now Curran Road) and Trade Street. Terraced houses were built from the corner of Blaenclydach Street south-westwards along Penart Road in 1891 to designs by the architect E.W.M. Corbett. The Atlas, or Hayes, Building was erected around 1893 and this survived until destroyed by fire in 1958. In 1894 Andrews constructed residential property from 75 to 113 Penarth Road, and the Andrews' Buildings on Queen Street to designs by the architect Edward Webb. In 1895 the firm started building work in Penarth. Andrews' Buildings (Penarth), erected in 1896, consisted of five shops fronting Stanwell Road, a corner shop and two shops in Windsor Terrace. In 1897 the company built Lloyds Bank on the corner of Windsor Road and Albert Road to designs by the architect Edward Webb. This was followed by the Windsor Arcade, a row of shops on Windsor Road. Around 1900 Metropole Buildings, 3‚Äì7 The Hayes, Cardiff was erected. This building was badly damaged by an air raid in the Second World War, but was reconstructed in 1959. Numbers,11, 12, and 13 Bute Street (now Hayes Bridge Road) were rebuilt in 1902 to designs by the architect Lennox Robertson. Andrews also constructed Pembroke Buildings on Pembroke Terrace in the same year, using the architect E.W.M. Corbett. Pwllheli Pwllheli Promenade In Pwllheli, Andrews was responsible for the development of the West End holiday resort, which included a promenade, housing, roads, a recreation ground, golf course, and the West End Hotel. The stone required to build the West End was provided by a local quarry that he leased at Carreg-y-defaid. The company constructed the Pwllheli and Llanbedrog Tramway, which carried the stone and passengers. The West End Hotel was constructed first, along with large houses numbered 1‚Äì4 The Parade. The hotel was probably completed by 1895 and the houses in 1896. The construction was mostly in concrete, with the joinery being provided by his workshops in Cardiff and delivered to Pwllheli by rail. Further building work was undertaken in 1897 when plans for nos 5‚Äì10 The Parade were approved by the council. Nos 11‚Äì16 followed quickly afterwards and all were completed by 1899. Construction of housing and shops in Cardiff Road was undertaken between 1897 and 1901. A power station was erected next to the Assembly Rooms behind the West End Hotel, to provide electrical power for the West End Hotel.History of the Gas Industry in Pwllheli, W. N. Thomas.

PC Magazine featured the UltraLite on its cover in November 1988Front Cover:NEC's Incredible 4-Pound DOS Laptop, 1988-11-15, Volume 7 Number 19, PC Magazine and shortly thereafter journalists began referring to the A4 sized computer as a \\"notebook\\" to distinguish it from the larger and heavier laptops of the time.

In 1988, as NEC was trying to create products to update their best selling MultiSpeed, the NEC engineering team in charge of developing personal computers showed the UltraLite to a product management team from NEC Home Electronics USA. Tom Martin, the Vice President in charge of the group, asked, \\"Can you make this thing run MS-DOS\\"? When an affirmative response was received, the NEC team knew they had a hit product on their hands. The product was launched shortly before COMDEX in October 1988 at a gala event in New York City. It was applauded by the media, who were dying to find a small lightweight computing platform that could be used for note-taking and article writing. Unfortunately the publicity surrounding the UltraLite did not reflect itself in consumer demand. This was due to the UltraLite's two Achilles heels ... the lack of a hard drive which prevented storage of one's work (for more than a week or so without charging the internal RAM drive) and the use of a relatively slow 8086-compatible processor when the market was moving to the 80286 class. The main downside to the Ultralite (which weighed only 4 pounds) was its price. It sold for between 4 and 5 thousand dollars which was significantly higher than other, albeit heavier, less innovative, computers of the time. Given its use of the ram drive boot times were actually faster than 80386 class computers. So although the UltraLite ushered in a new era in portable computing, its original design as a telecommunications maintenance terminal proved to be its commercial downfall. Commercial success in that product category was not achieved until Compaq launched its LTE brand nearly 12 months later.  Data Storage  Data storage can be done by an optional external 720kb (in fact it supported \\"Japanese\\" 1.2Mb format but did not support more common 1.44Mb) 3.5-inch floppy drive, by the internal non- volatile RAM drive (silicon hard drive), or by proprietary RAM and ROM cards. The internal ram drive is powered by an auxiliary battery inside the unit which needs to be recharged every week or so in order to keep the contents of the ram drive. The credit-card sized, battery-powered RAM cards come with capacity sizes of 256kb or 512Kb. Both RAM cards and ROM cards use a proprietary NEC interface because this laptop came out at a time when there were no standard portable computing interfaces. The PCMCIA standard did not exist until 1990. The RAM cards were powered by a replaceable 3 volt lithium coin battery and had a write-protect switch.  ROM cards  Software can be bought running from ROM cards.

He wrote a number of books on Irish history as a Marxist historian. A member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, through the Connolly Association he was one of the key figures, along with Roy Johnston, responsible for inserting Marxist perspectives into the 1960s Irish republicanism, in relation to the Northern Ireland civil rights movement. History Greaves was born in Birkenhead, England. His father, Charles Edward Greaves, a post office official, and his mother, Amy Elisabeth Taylor, were Methodists. He studied at Liverpool University where he graduated in chemistry and botany, he worked as a research chemist at Powell Duffryn. In 1934 he joined Communist Party of Great Britain. In 1941 he joined the Connolly Club which became the Connolly Association, and became editor of its magazine, The Irish Democrat.C. Desmond Greaves profile, irishdemocrat.co.uk; accessed 25 February 2015. During the 1950s Greaves used his influence at the Connolly Association to push the view that the best path to a United Ireland would be to discredit Ulster Unionism in the eyes of British Politicians. He believed this could be achieved by exposing how discriminatory the Stormont regime in Belfast was. Greaves' policy was made part of the Connolly Association's constitution in December 1955. From there on out, Greaves and the Connolly Association worked to influence and educate British political opinion, especially on the left and in particular within the British Labour Party. This was no easy task as during the 1940s the Labour Party's stance was to support Unionists, partially as a reward for their support during World War 2. One example of this would be the passing of the Ireland Act 1949, which gave Stormont a veto over any constitutional change relating to Northern Ireland. However, by the end of the 1950s their efforts were bearing fruit; for example, the Association was able to raise the issue of hundreds of prisoners being detained without trial in Northern Ireland under the Special Powers Act of 1922. Thanks to the Associate putting pressure on the British Labour, who in turn put pressure on Lord Brookeborough they were able to force the release of the prisoners. Greaves and the Connolly Association would continue to push Labour against the Unionists into the 1960s, which would later prove to be a key piece of political strategy on the eve of The Troubles. Greaves became associated with Roy Johnston, a Dublin- born member of the Irish Workers' Party who had migrated to England. They and their theories came to have an influence over 1960s Irish republicanism through Cathal Goulding and Tom√°s Mac Giolla, who also adhered to a Marxist perspective. During the split within the Irish republican movement in 1969, Greaves' Connolly Association supported Official Sinn F√©in (later known as the Workers' Party) and the Official Irish Republican Army, rather than the Provisionals. This was done under the rationale of anti-sectarianism, claiming that the Provisionals were representative of just the Catholic nationalist community. His library of Irish books is held at the Working Class Movement Library in Salford, deposited by his executor Anthony Coughlan. The Desmond Greaves summer school is held each year as a forum for discussing topics which exercised him, such as Irish left wing, and republican politics.√âanna √ì Caolla√≠, \\"Something for the weekend: What's on\\", Irish Times, 15 September 2012; retrieved 12 January 2013.

It may be translated as 'forest grove'. Literary references It is mentioned in the Welsh tale Culhwch and Olwen which may date from the 11th century. The story describes the court as being at Celliwig in Cernyw (the Welsh name for Cornwall), otherwise known as the kingdom of Dumnonia including modern Devon. The hall is guarded by Glewlwyd Gafaelfawr, Arthur's porter, and Culhwch has difficulty gaining entrance due to the special laws that restrict entry once a feast has begun. Though there is no description of the place the implications of the story are of great wealth and splendour. It describes Arthur's warriors at the court in depth and says that: \\"From here, one of his Warband, Drem, could see a gnat as far away as Scotland; while another, Medyr, could shoot an arrow through the legs of a wren in Ireland!\\" Some of the Trioedd Ynys Prydein (or Welsh Triads) mention Arthur and \\"Three Tribal Thrones of the Island of Britain\\" and locate one of his courts at Celliwig: \\"Arthur as Chief Prince in Celliwig in Cernyw, and Bishop Bytwini as Chief Bishop, and Caradog Freichfras as Chief Elder.\\" Caradoc was his chief elder at this court and that Bishop Bytwini or Bedwin was chief bishop. This is one of the early triads found in Peniarth MS 54 reflecting information recorded before Geoffrey of Monmouth. The same triad goes on to say Arthur's other courts were at Mynyw and Pen Rhionydd. The triads also state that at Celliwig Mordred struck Gwenhwyfar a blow. This may have led to the Battle of Camlann. The early Welsh poem Pa g≈µr yw'r porthor? may also mention the court. Celliwig was also known to the Cornish as well, as it appears as Kyllywyc in the Cornish-language play Beunans Ke, written perhaps around 1500. In the Iolo Manuscripts (1843), a corpus of pseudo- medieval Welsh texts by the renowned literary forger and inventor of tradition Iolo Morganwg (1747‚Äì1826), Celliwig is referred as the former site of the \\"throne of Cornwall\\" but the text adds that it is now at Caervynyddawg (Caerfynyddog), a site which is otherwise unattested.Taliesin ab Iolo (ed.), Iolo Manuscripts  Location  * A 1302 Cornish legal record mentions a 'Thomas de Kellewik' from west Cornwall, though his exact place of origin is unknown. Translated into SWF Cornish this would be meaning \\"woods town\\" cognate with Latin and Saxon . * Celliwig was identified by some Cornish antiquaries from 1816 onwards with Callington (occasionally locally attested as 'Callywith') where the ancient monuments of Castlewich Henge and Cadson Bury are in close proximity.

It runs from Birmingham to Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, now the southern terminus of the line, although until 1976 the line continued to Cheltenham as part of the Great Western Railway route from Birmingham to Bristol. The line is one of the Snow Hill Lines. It is not electrified and is operated by West Midlands Trains using Class 172 diesel multiple units. The northern part of the line is suburban in nature, and has a regular and busy commuter service into central Birmingham. The southern part (south of ) is rural in nature, and has a less frequent service, with a number of rural request stops. Despite the name, the line does not pass through the area commonly known as North Warwickshire, instead, the name of the line was believed to be derived from that of the local hunt. History Early history The original plans for the line were promoted by an independent company; the Birmingham, North Warwickshire and Stratford Railway, which received Royal assent in August 1894. The company failed to raise the necessary funds to build the line, and the powers to build it were taken over by the Great Western Railway (GWR) in July 1900. The GWR incorporated the line into their own scheme to build a new Birmingham to Cheltenham via Stratford main line. Construction began in September 1905, the line was opened to goods traffic on 9 December 1907, and to passengers on 1 July 1908. The NWL connected to the existing main line into Birmingham at , and ran south to Bearley, where it connected to the pre-existing single track Hatton to branch line, which had been opened in 1860 by the Stratford on Avon Railway. Part of this branch between Bearley and Stratford was doubled as part of the work, to incorporate it into the new main line, providing a more direct link between Birmingham and Stratford, connecting Henley-in-Arden and Shirley en route. This made redundant the existing branch line to Henley-in-Arden from , which later closed in 1915. The NWL formed the final stage of a new main line route, which also incorporated most of the branch south of Stratford to , opened in 1859, which was also doubled at the same time, and joined to a new line from Honeybourne to Cheltenham (the Honeybourne Line), which had been completed in 1906. This gave the GWR a new main line between the West Midlands and the South West of England and South Wales, providing a shorter link than existing routes via Oxford and Hereford. It thus placed the Great Western in a position to compete with the Birmingham to Bristol route of the Midland Railway. Moor Street station in Birmingham, was opened soon after the opening of the North Warwickshire Line, and served as the Birmingham terminus of most local services on the line, as well local services from Leamington Spa. Moor Street was opened to take these local services and so, relieve congestion at Birmingham Snow Hill which handled the long-distance services. Local services were operated initially by railmotors; which were self-propelled steam carriages. These were later superseded by autotrains; a form of push-pull train. From the start, the line carried long-distance services from the West Midlands to Bristol, South Wales, and the South West of England. These were suspended during the First World War, then developed in the 1920s and '30s, were suspended again in the Second World War, finally reaching their peak in the 1950s, at which time up to six such trains traversed the line each weekday. The doyen of these services was always the daily train from Wolverhampton to Penzance, latterly named \\"The Cornishman\\". The line was especially busy during summer months, as it became the principal holiday route between Birmingham and Devon and Cornwall, and many extra holiday excursion trains would run. A pioneering diesel railcar service with a buffet commenced running in July 1934 between Birmingham Snow Hill and Cardiff, running non- stop through Stratford, with only two stops at Gloucester and Newport. This was the first long-distance diesel express service in Britain. It proved so successful that larger railcars with more seating and no buffet had to be introduced to cope with demand, and even this had to be augmented by a normal locomotive hauled service. During the Second World War, the railcar service was the only through service using the line, as all other long-distance trains were suspended. At this time it consisted of a three car train consisting of a standard carriage sandwiched between two railcars. Two such trains ran to and from Cardiff daily at this period, and a stop at Stratford was introduced.warwickshirerailways.com/gwr/gwrsa1491.htmwarwickshirerailways.com/gwr/gwrsa1509.htm The line passed into the ownership of British Railways in 1948, following nationalisation. Cutbacks and closure attempts The North Warwickshire Line has survived two attempts at closure. The line between Tyseley and Bearley junctions was listed for closure as part of the Beeching Axe closures in the 1960s. This would have left Stratford connected to the rail network only by the branch to Hatton, reverting to the pre-1908 situation. The closure proposals provoked a strong local campaign to save the line, which eventually went to the High Court, resulting in a court injunction preventing closure of the line in 1969. However British Rail made another attempt at closure in 1984, when they appealed to have the injunction lifted. This time the proposal was to close the line between Henley-in-Arden and Bearley junction, and to divert Stratford trains via Solihull. This again provoked a strong local response, and BR withdrew the closure proposal in 1987. However many cutbacks were made. Long-distance services were cut back from September 1962, when the \\"Cornishman\\" and the Birmingham-Cardiff expresses were re-routed. A few passenger services remained south of Stratford to until 1968, and to Worcester via until 1969. The line south of Stratford remained open for freight until 1976, when damage caused by a serious freight train derailment led to British Rail deciding to close the line entirely. The track was lifted in 1979, ending the North Warwickshire Line's role as a through main line. Recent history Since the 1990s, the line has been marketed as the 'Shakespeare Line'. The line was resignalled by Network Rail in 2009/2011, replacing the semaphore signals in place, and improving platform access at Stratford; it also saw the removal of the three remaining signal boxes at Shirley, Henley- in-Arden and Bearley Junction. As part of this scheme, terminating services from Birmingham were extended from to the next station, , by the addition of a new turnback facility. Park and ride facilities were added at Whitlocks End to encourage commuters to drive there, in order to reduce traffic congestion at Shirley station. In 2011 a new fleet of diesel multiple units was introduced to operate the line (along with the other Snow Hill Lines) replacing the older s which had operated the line since 1990. In May 2013 station was opened north of Stratford. This allows commuters to use the train without driving into Stratford. Current services The current daytime service level, is three trains per hour between Birmingham Snow Hill and Whitlocks End, one of which continues to Stratford. A second hourly service between Birmingham and Stratford runs via , joining or leaving the North Warwickshire Line at Bearley Junction, meaning a half-hourly service exists between Birmingham and Stratford. Most Birmingham trains continue beyond Snow Hill to either , or Worcester. On summer Sundays, a steam service, the \\"Shakespeare Express\\" is operated by Vintage Trains between Birmingham and Stratford. Possible future development The Shakespeare Line Promotion Group is promoting a scheme to reopen the of line south of Stratford to where it would link to the Cotswold Line. Called the \\"Avon Rail Link\\", the scheme (supported as a freight diversionary route by DB Schenker) would make Stratford-upon-Avon station a through station once again with improved connections to the South, and would open up the possibility of direct services to and Worcester via . The scheme faces local opposition. A plan asserted that there was a good business case for Stratford-Cotswolds link.

Stupas originated as pre-Buddhist tumuli, in which ascetics were buried in a seated position, called chaitya. After the parinirvana of the Buddha, his remains were cremated and the ashes divided and buried under eight mounds with two further mounds encasing the urn and the embers. Little is known about these early stupas, particularly since it has not been possible to identify the original ten monuments. However, some later stupas, such as at Sarnath and Sanchi, seem to be embellishments of earlier mounds. The Dhamek Stupa was built in 500 CESir Banister Fletcher's a History of Architecture, 20th ed.

Stupas originated as circular mounds encircled by large stones. King Ashoka built stupas to enshrine small pieces of calcinated bone and other relics of the Buddha and his disciples. An Ashoka pillar with an edict engraved on it stands near the site. The Dhamek Stupa is said to mark the spot (Rishipattana which can be translated as \\"where the Rishi arrived\\") where the Buddha gave the first sermon to his first five Brahmin disciples after attaining enlightenment, \\"revealing his Eightfold Path leading to nirvana\\".Quoted from: Pippa de Bruyn, Niloufer Venkatraman, Keith Bain.

These routes work in the Earth‚ÄìMoon system and also in other systems, such as between the moons of Jupiter. The drawback of such trajectories is that they take longer to complete than higher-energy (more-fuel) transfers, such as Hohmann transfer orbits. Low-energy transfers are also known as weak stability boundary trajectories, or ballistic capture trajectories. Low-energy transfers follow special pathways in space, sometimes referred to as the Interplanetary Transport Network. Following these pathways allows for long distances to be traversed for little change in velocity, or . Example missions Missions that have used low-energy transfers include: * Hiten, from JAXA * SMART-1, from ESA * Genesis, from NASA.Interplanetary Superhighway Makes Space Travel Simpler // NASA 07.17.02: \\"Lo conceived the theory of the Interplanetary Superhighway. Lo and his colleagues have turned the underlying mathematics of the Interplanetary Superhighway into a tool for mission design called \\"LTool,\\" ... The new LTool was used by JPL engineers to redesign the flight path for the Genesis mission\\" * GRAIL, from NASA. On-going missions planned to use low- energy transfers include: * BepiColombo, from ESA/JAXA Proposed missions using low-energy transfers include: * European Student Moon Orbiter (ESMO) * Mars Direct History Low-energy transfers to the Moon were first demonstrated in 1991 by the Japanese spacecraft Hiten, which was designed to swing by the Moon but not to enter orbit. The Hagoromo subsatellite was released by Hiten on its first swing-by and may have successfully entered lunar orbit, but suffered a communications failure. Edward Belbruno and James Miller of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory had heard of the failure, and helped to salvage the mission by developing a ballistic capture trajectory that would enable the main Hiten probe to itself enter lunar orbit. The trajectory they developed for Hiten used Weak Stability Boundary Theory and required only a small perturbation to the elliptical swing-by orbit, sufficiently small to be achievable by the spacecraft's thrusters. This course would result in the probe being captured into temporary lunar orbit using zero , but required five months instead of the usual three days for a Hohmann transfer. Delta-v savings From low Earth orbit to lunar orbit, the savings approach 25% on the burn applied after leaving low Earth orbit, compared to the retrograde burn applied near the Moon in the traditional , and allow for a doubling of payload. Robert Farquhar had described a 9-day route from low earth orbit to lunar capture that takes 3.5 km/s. Belbruno's routes from low Earth orbit require a 3.1 km/s burn for trans lunar injection, a delta-v saving of not more than 0.4 km/s. However, the latter require no large delta-v change after leaving low Earth orbit, which may have operational benefits if using an upper stage with limited restart or in-orbit endurance capability, which would require the spacecraft to have a separate main propulsion system for capture. For rendezvous with the Martian moons, the savings are 12% for Phobos and 20% for Deimos. Rendezvous is targeted because the stable pseudo-orbits around the Martian moons do not spend much time within 10 km of the surface.

The firm's most notable client is Danske Bank whistleblower Howard Wilkinson, who exposed what many experts believe to be the largest money-laundering scandal in world banking history. Other notable clients include Bradley Birkenfeld, a private banker who blew the whistle on UBS AG's aiding and abetting of tax fraud by the Swiss bank's American clientele, and Linda Tripp, the former White House and U.S. Department of Defense employee who blew the whistle on President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. __TOC__  Current Operations  Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto specializes in a variety of anti-corruption and whistleblower law practice areas, including tax evasion, securities and commodities fraud, qui tam, environmental crimes, animal trafficking, and white-collar crime. The firm has also worked on behalf of whistleblowers who have suffered workplace retaliation for reporting fraud internally. Working with the National Whistleblower Center, Kohn, Kohn and Colapinto is active on a range of pro bono works. KKC has provided pro bono representation to public interest organizations and whistleblowers at congressional policy and legislative hearings. The firm has submitted numerous amicus curiae briefs in landmark whistleblowing cases before the Supreme Court to establish legal precedents on whistleblower protection laws. KKC has also served the public interest by filing various reports and petitions to contribute to the Securities and Exchange Commission and Internal Revenue Service whistleblower rulemaking. They have worked toward strengthening whistleblower reward provisions in major environmental and wildlife protection laws by advocating the effectiveness of incentivizing whistleblowers worldwide in preventing environmental crimes. Federal Bureau of Investigation cases The law firm founded by the Kohn brothers in 1988 first focused on defending nuclear power industry whistleblowers, who were retaliated against by their employers for revealing nuclear safety problems. This led to other areas of whistleblowing litigation, most prominently in the firm's defense of federal employees. KKC defended African American FBI agents charging racial discrimination within the bureau. The firm also defended Dr. Frederic Whitehurst, a forensics expert who blew the whistle on the lax standards at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Laboratory and subsequently suffered retaliation by the agency. Involvement in the FBI Lab case involved KKC in the O.J. Simpson murder case, as the forensic standards used by the prosecutors, and the forensic work itself such as DNA analysis, was called into question by Whitehurst's revelations against the FBI Lab, which had become the national authority in the field of forensic investigations. Linda Tripp Privacy Act case Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto gained nationwide attention representing whistleblower Linda Tripp regarding her revelations of Monica Lewinsky's involvement in the sex scandal that brought about the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. The revelations that Lewinsky and Clinton had lied in their legal filings in the sexual harassment case brought against the sitting president by Paula Jones, and that Lewinsky had tried to suborn perjury from Tripp, who knew about her affair with Clinton, was one of the main factors influencing the articles of impeachment voted by the House of Representatives. Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto handled Tripp's lawsuit against the Justice Department and the Department of Defense under the Privacy Act of 1974. Tripp had sued the government for violating her rights under the Privacy Act alleging that the Clinton Administration leaked confidential details of her employment record to the press. The government eventually settled with Tripp, including agreeing to a one-time payment of more than $595,000, a retroactive promotion, and retroactive pay at the highest salary for 1998, 1999 and 2000. She also received a pension and was cleared to work for the federal government again. Her rights to remain part of a class action lawsuit against the government were also preserved. Qui tam actions The firm also handles suits filed under the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act. through . These provisions allow persons and entities with knowledge of fraud committed against the federal government to sue the perpetrator on behalf of the United States, either with the government joining the action or, if the government declines, as a private plaintiff on their own. Qui tam has its roots in the Abraham Lincoln administration, as Lincoln was concerned with fraud by government contractors during the Civil War. Murphy tax case One of the firm's clients was defeated after a preliminary victory in the tax refund case of Murphy v. IRS,460 F.3d 79, 2006-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,476, 2006 WL 2411372 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 22, 2006). in which the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia originally held unconstitutional to the extent the statute purports to tax emotional distress awards unrelated to lost wages. On December 22, 2006, the Court vacated its own judgment in that case. According to the Web site Tax Analysts, Murphy v. IRS \\"is not only one of the most significant tax decisions in decades, but it is also one of the most important constitutional cases in decades as well\\". The now-voided ruling had shaken up the tax community as it is rare for a federal court to hold that a tax law is unconstitutional. The case was argued for the appellants by Colapinto, who was assisted on the briefs by S. Kohn. On July 3, 2007, the Court ruled against Ms. Murphy. The court held (1) that the taxpayer's compensation was received on account of a non-physical injury or sickness; (2) that gross income under section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code. does include compensatory damages for non-physical injuries, even if the award is not an \\"accession to wealth,\\" (3) that the income tax imposed on an award for non- physical injuries is an indirect tax, regardless of whether the recovery is restoration of \\"human capital,\\" and therefore the tax does not violate the constitutional requirement of Article I, section 9, that capitations or other direct taxes must be laid among the states only in proportion to the population; (4) that the income tax imposed on an award for non-physical injuries does not violate the constitutional requirement of Article I, section 8, that all duties, imposts, and excises be uniform throughout the United States; (5) that under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the Internal Revenue Service may not be sued in its own name.Opinion on rehearing, July 3, 2007, Murphy v.

In February 2009, as a result of the information he gave U.S. authorities, the DOJ announced it had reached a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with UBS that resulted in a $780 million fine and the release of previously privileged information on American tax evaders. In 2008, Birkenfeld pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States by abetting tax evasion by one of his clients and was sentenced in 2009 to 40 months in prison. Many advocacy groups from around the world criticized Birkenfeld's prosecution and sentence on the grounds that it would discourage financial industry whistleblowers. Birkenfeld subsequently fired his lawyers, Schertler and Onorato, and hired Kohn Kohn & Colapinto to represent him and his whistleblowing claims. On 11 September 2012, the IRS Whistleblower Office awarded Birkenfeld $104 million as a whistleblower. Birkenfeld received the award under the IRS whistleblower program, which gives informants a percentage of money the U.S. government recovers after fraud is found. The award was the largest whistleblower payout in history, to either an individual or a group. It surpassed the $96 million awarded to GlaxoSmithKline whistleblower Cheryl D. Eckard in 2010. The IRS explained its decision by citing Birkenfeld's \\"exceptional cooperation\\" and the \\"breadth and depth\\" of the information he provided, all of which led to \\"unprecedented actions\\" against UBS. IRS amnesty programs have since collected $5 billion from people who participated in UBS's illegal scheme based on the information provided by Birkenfeld.

In 2006, he was discharged from the United States Army under the Don't ask, don't tell policy for being gay. The discharge was seen as controversial not only for the policy but also for the timing when the Army had a pronounced need for Arab translators with the war on terrorism. Born in 1976, Copas was raised in Tennessee in a conservative and religious environment. He reports admiring the ideal of military service as a child, and he enrolled in ROTC in college. After the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Copas enlisted in the Army. After basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, he attended the Defense Language Institute in California. There, he was trained in Arabic for future assignment as a combat translator. Copas, who never admitted being gay while a soldier, was discharged honorably after an eight-month investigation. The investigation was triggered by a number of anonymous e-mails accusing Copas of homosexual acts; Copas's battalion commander with the 82nd Airborne at Fort Bragg determined that the evidence was sufficient to discharge Copas despite his denial. The Army claimed that the evidence indicated that Copas had engaged in at least two homosexual affairs while in the service, and that the e-mails had been sent in revenge for the failure of one of these relationships. Copas suggests that the information came from an anonymous informant whom he had met and mistakenly befriended in a chat room. Copas has since returned to East Tennessee State University where he is studying for a master's degree in counseling.

Performance-Based Pedagogy Assessment of Teacher Candidates , Washington State Superintendent of Public Instruction, June 2004 Authentic assessment can be devised by the teacher, or in collaboration with the student by engaging student voice. When applying authentic assessment to student learning and achievement, a teacher applies criteria related to ‚Äúconstruction of knowledge, disciplined inquiry, and the value of achievement beyond the school.‚Äù Authentic assessment tends to focus on contextualised tasks, enabling students to demonstrate their competency in a more 'authentic' setting. Examples of authentic assessment categories include: * performance of the skills, or demonstrating use of a particular knowledge * simulations and role plays * studio portfolios, strategically selecting items According to Meg Ormiston, \\"Authentic learning mirrors the tasks and problem solving that are required in the reality outside of school.\\" This framework for assessment begins the same way curriculum design begins, with the question: What should students be able to do? Once the instructor answers that question, they can then devise a rubric to evaluate how well a student demonstrates the ability to complete the task. Because most authentic assessments require a judgement of the degree of quality, they tend toward the subjective end of the assessment scale. Rubrics are an \\"attempt to make subjective measurements as objective, clear, consistent, and as defensible as possible by explicitly defining the criteria on which performance or achievement should be judged.\\"  Authentic vs. traditional  Traditionally, assessment follows curriculum. Authentic assessment is an example of \\"backwards design\\" because the curriculum follows from the assessment. Case studies One case study was presented by Edutopia's Schools That Work series on New York based institution, School of the Future. This school stresses the process of authentically assessing students rather than focusing solely on test results or term papers.http://www.edutopia.org/stw-assessment-school-of- the-future The school measures the full range of student ability through formative assessments, presentations, exhibitions, and tests that focus on authentic tasks to assess students' skills and knowledge as they relate to real-world endeavors and skills such as effective group communication and presentation. 98% of students at this school go on to college after graduating.http://www.edutopia.org/stw-assessment Classroom implementation Teachers from The School of The Future in New York utilize authentic assessment in their school and recommend that other teachers can do the same by following the guidelines outlined below: *Write the assessment before the lesson plan *Outline learning standards on rubrics to help to ensure rigor *Use quick in-class assessments without warning or scaffolding to assess student understanding and inform teaching *Ask students to reflect and assess themselves *Use online or traditional tools to track a student‚Äôs work quality over timehttp://www.edutopia.org/stw-assessment-ten-lessons-get-started Goals A goal of authentic assessment is to determine if student knowledge can be applied outside of the classroom. This means that a physics assessment should involve doing physics by performing experiments and solving problems the same way that a real-life physicist would. An authentic history assessment requires students to ask questions, do independent research, and formulate answers to their questions, just like a real-life historian does. Authentic assessment: * engages students and is based in content or media in which the students actually have a genuine interest. * asks students to synthesize information and use critical-thinking skills. * is a learning experience in and of itself. * measures not just what students remember but how they think. * helps students understand where they are academically and helps teachers know how to best teach them.

Background In the years following the introduction of the Pensions Act 1995, it was widely perceived that it was failing to offer the protection to pension scheme members that had been anticipated. The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority was perceived as being reactive, didactic and uncommercial. The minimum funding requirement had not prevented some pension schemes winding up with insufficient assets to secure their liabilities, amid considerable publicity. There was strong political pressure to establish a guarantee fund similar to the American Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Much of the regulation was perceived to be unnecessarily restrictive. The Pensions Act 2004 was written to try to fix these deficiences. The Act introduced two new regulatory institutions: the Pensions Regulator, with the powers to require sponsoring companies to make contributions to ensure that scheme funding objectives are met; and the Pension Protection Fund, which would inherit the pension liabilities of a pension scheme in the event that a sponsoring company becomes insolvent. In assessing the consequences of the Act, there is evidence that corporate dividend and investment sensitivities to pension contributions were more pronounced in and after 2005, indicating that the regulations imposed by the Act had a significant effect on corporate expenditures. Overview The main features of the Act include: * The abolition of the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority and its replacement by the Pensions Regulator, with wider powers to intervene of its own volition; * New powers for the Pensions Regulator to intervene where employers, directors and majority shareholders were perceived to be avoiding their responsibilities to pension schemes and where employers were insufficiently resourced to support the pension scheme; * New notification requirements; * The establishment of the Pension Protection Fund to provide benefits for pension scheme members where a pension scheme had gone into winding-up with insufficient resources to fund scheme benefits and no employer to make good the underfunding; * The abolition of the minimum funding requirement and its replacement with scheme-specific funding requirements; * Modification of the protections for existing pension scheme benefits and of the requirements for pension schemes to have member nominated trustees.

It was built in the 1830s for the Mahony family to a neo-gothic design by Sir Thomas Deane. Building Dromore Castle was designed and built for Denis Mahony by the architect Thomas Deane, probably assisted by his brother Kearns Deane. Work began in 1831, although the account books show that only a negligible amount had been carried out before May 1834. Building work was completed in 1839. The house is in the castellated Gothic Revival style, with an external finish of Roman Cement with limestone dressings. With the notable exception of the grand south facing window with its pointed arch, the windows consist of pointed tracery contained within rectangular frames, a style characteristic of Deane's domestic work. The entrance hall, which is in the form of a long gallery, takes up half of the area of the ground floor. The west wing of the Castle takes the form of a round tower, with a spiral staircase contained within an attached turret. History Although Dromore Castle appears to have been built on the instructions of Denis Mahony, his father John Mahony had made the decision to build a large home earlier in the 19th century, but apparently abandoned the attempt after his yacht, returning from London with lead for the roof and wine for the cellar, sank in the Kenmare River, in view of the site of the house. After this, no further work took place until Deane began building work for Denis Mahony in the 1830s Denis Mahony was a minister of the Church of Ireland and a keen proselytiser. He is known to have set up a soup kitchen at Dromore during the time of the Great Famine, and preached in the chapel at Dromore to the hungry who came for food. His proselytizing activities did not make him a popular figure in the locality, and in 1850 he was attacked in his church at Templenoe. On returning to Dromore, he found a further angry group had uprooted flower beds, felled trees and were about to set fire to the castle; it is claimed that they were only stopped by the intervention of the local Catholic priest, Fr John O'Sullivan. After Rev. Denis Mahony's death in 1851, the castle was inherited by his son Richard John Mahony, who successfully ran the estate in addition to farming oyster beds in the bay. When Richard Mahony died, the castle then passed in turn to his son, Harold Segerson Mahony. Harold Mahony was a successful tennis player, and indeed was the last Irish winner at Wimbledon. His tennis court can still be found in the gardens at the Castle. It was in the late 1800s, during Harold Mahony's time as head of the household, that Harold Boulton, best known for writing the lyrics of the Skye Boat Song, came to visit Dromore, and it is then that he is thought to have written the words to the popular song \\"The Castle of Dromore,\\" published in 1892 in English and later translated into Irish.http://www.irishpage.com/poems/dromore.htm When Harold Mahony was killed in a bicycle accident in 1905, he left no heirs, and the castle was passed to his sister, Norah Hood. She in turn left the castle to her cousin, Hugh Bolton Waller, and the castle remained in the hands of the Waller family until 1993 when it was offered for sale. Dromore Castle is now owned by an investment company who are attempting to restore the house. Grounds Beyond the Castle's gardens and outbuildings, the majority of the Castle grounds are now owned by Coillte Teoranta, the Irish forestry board. The Kerry Way runs through the grounds, and there are various footpaths leading to the Kenmare River. Entrance to the grounds from the N70 road between Kenmare and Sneem is through a castellated gatehouse, also by Thomas Deane.

Most of the events took place in Budapest and other major cities between 17 September and 23 October. It was the first sustained protest in Hungary since 1989.  Audio recording  Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny On September 17, 2006, an audio recording surfaced from a closed-door MSZP meeting which was held on May 26, 2006, in which Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny made a speech, notable for its obscene language, including the following excerpt (censored version): > There is not much choice.

By midnight, the number of demonstrators reached 2,000. A few hundred people went to the State President's residency but later returned. This spontaneous demonstration was entirely peaceful.  Day 1: Monday, September 18, 2006  Budapest  Civil unrest  On September 18, as a consequence of the audio recording and the unwillingness of the Prime Minister or his party to resign, a demonstration was held near the Hungarian Parliament. Approximately 40,000 protesters demanded the resignation of Gyurcs√°ny and his party for lying throughout the term and then during the campaign to win the next election. H√≠r TV The police deemed the demonstration legal, arguing that the rules applicable during the campaign period towards the upcoming municipal elections allow for such short-notice political meetings.  Riot and violence  After 23:00, a smaller group of the demonstrators tried to get into the Magyar Telev√≠zi√≥ public television building at Szabads√°g T√©r (Liberty Square) to announce their demands on air. After they were not allowed to enter, a smaller group attacked the police forces. The riot police units which were intended to secure the building and the perimeter were ordered to disperse the crowd with tear gas and a water cannon. They blocked the main entrances but were unable to stop the attackers who could get inside the building. Some demonstrators became indignant at the authorities' resistance and were later joined by a group of enraged football ultras. A hardcore subgroup of them started to make repeated assaults in order to penetrate the defences and break into the building. The police retaliated, using tear gas and a water cannon. The crowd became enraged and attacked the police units by throwing cobblestones and debris (injuring 141 police officers), but they didn't attack the two drivers of the water cannon mobil. They also set several parked cars ablaze (which led to part of the building catching fire too) and eventually managed to enter the building, forcing the police back. The demonstrators managed to voice their demands, but since the television station had already ceased its transmission due to the riot, it was not aired live. The building was abandoned about 02:30 by the police. After that, the mob entered the premises. Some of the intruders merely took pictures of themselves and the scene, while others destroyed the dining room and the main hall of the building. The historical television technology exhibition was also demolished: valuable vintage equipment was smashed and techno-historical objects like vintage props were stolen, as were some expensive plasma TV sets. Arson was also reported. All these acts were aired and/or verified by reports from state television officials, police and media coverage. Index Origo Police reinforcements arrived much later, and they managed to reclaim the building before dawn. Magyar Telev√≠zi√≥ resumed its transmission at 06:07. Index Over 150 people were injured, including 102 policemen. The property damage resulting from the fight is estimated to be over 230 million forints (about 800,000 EUR). Other cities In Miskolc on Monday (September 18), about 2,000 citizens protested on St. Stephen Square, where √Årp√°d Mikl√≥s, chairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party's (MI√âP) county committee gave a speech, jokingly saying that Gyurcs√°ny might as well join MI√âP as they had been calling Gyurcs√°ny a liar for years, and now he himself had admitted to it, so they are on the same opinion now. People shouted anti-government remarks and sang the national anthem and the Szekler anthem, then marched to the nearby city hall. Later, at the proposal of the MI√âP chairman, they went to the Hungarian Socialist Party's (MSZP) headquarters on Corvin Street, which was secured by the police. Traffic was blocked by the demonstrators in parts of the inner city. Also on Monday the Miskolc committee of opposition party Fidesz sent a press release to MTI (Hungarian News Agency) titled ‚ÄúOne cannot build a city on lies‚Äù (a play on MSZP slogan We're building a brand new Miskolc which refers to the extensive downtown reconstruction program started by the party). In the press release, the committee declared that the seven members of parliament from MSZP's Miskolc committee, including Mayor S√°ndor K√°li and deputy mayors Vilmos Fedor and Erika Sz≈±cs must have known about Gyurcs√°ny's lies, since all of them were present in Balaton≈ësz√∂d and heard the Prime Minister's speech. Fidesz accused these members of parliament of becoming Gyurcs√°ny's accomplices by keeping quiet.

The text on the yellow paper reads \\"We had enough!\\" In the evening a mostly peaceful demonstration took place at Kossuth Square, aside from demonstrators vandalizing a tram on the Square and a car in front of the Socialist Party's county headquarters. Later that night in other parts of the city, including the areas near the headquarters of MSZP and the HQ of the public radio station, violence broke out again. Large numbers of riot troops were deployed along with mounted police and K-9 units, acting more systematically than before. The use of tear gas and water cannons with accompanying mounted assaults prevented another building siege. Other police units applied police batons and body force. At 01:00 (Sep 20), about 3,000 protesters gathered at Blaha Lujza Square. The crowd demanded the departure of Prime Minister Gyurcs√°ny. Protesters threw stones and debris at the police, set a police car ablaze and even tried to build barricades but repeated police movements forced them back. By 09:00, the streets were cleared and more than 90 troublemakers were arrested with over 50 people injured. Most local media sources (including news television and news portals) covering the events referred to the attacking civilians as \\"troublemakers\\" or \\"rowdies\\", thus implying that these violent people were neither protesters nor peaceful civil demonstrators, but just a mob. The first rows of the masses were reported to behave aggressively, backed verbally by youngsters in the background. As opposed to the first night's siege, the crowd did not attack or hinder fire brigade and paramedics, but on one (probably unique) occasion it was observed that a mobster repeatedly kicked another civilian already lying on the ground.(reference in Hungarian: post entry of 02:33 at Index Hungary Live reports suggested that part of the mob also shouted claims that the violent acts were similar to those of the 1956 Revolution. On the late night live talk show, Este (Evening), on the previously besieged MTV, Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny was faced with the consequences of his actions, and the protester's demands, when he read their petition which they managed to hand over the previous day. He replied that it was not just himself, but everybody who had lied, and he would not resign. He said he was committed to pushing through his austerity measures in any circumstances, without the possibility of even a minor change to it. The full report . Other cities The party's county office, with the smashed window In Miskolc, policemen, including police captain Albert P√°sztor, were already at St. Stephen Square when the demonstrations began at 17:00. People held banners saying \\"Our homeland is not a 'whore country'\\", (A haz√°nk nem egy \\"kurva orsz√°g\\") referring to the Gyurcs√°ny talk. The demonstrators again went to the city hall, then to the MSZP office, where at the request of a university student, a speaker read the proclamation of the protest planned on September 21 against tuition fees (the introduction of which was one of the most controversial decisions of Gyurcs√°ny's government). The national anthem and Sz√≥zat were sung both at the city hall and at the MSZP office, while demonstrators stood with their backs to the buildings. Demonstrators demanded that a declaration be read in a local TV station, but the station's manager refused. In Szeged at 19:00, 500‚Äì600 people protested against Gyurcs√°ny but, within a few minutes, there were already thousands of demonstrators marching from the city hall to D√≥m t√©r (Cathedral Square). From there, they went to the Socialist Party's building, which was defended by the police. The demonstration was continued on Tuesday before the City Hall, where about 3,000 people demanded the government's resignation, new elections, and democracy. Police secured the City Hall and the regional offices of Hungarian Television and Hungarian Radio. The county chairman of Jobbik, the organizer of the demonstration, stated that they wanted to achieve their goal ‚Äì the resignation of Gyurcs√°ny's government ‚Äì through peaceful demonstrations, which would continue every evening until September 23, when they would hold a demonstration in Budapest. In Eger about 1,000 citizens demonstrated, demanding that President S√≥lyom dissolve the National Assembly. Demonstrators also requested the city's Socialist mayor Imre Nagy to initiate Gyurcs√°ny's dismissal. Romania On Tuesday, several demonstrations of solidarity took place in Romania, in cities with a strong ethnic Hungarian population. In the evening, some 70 people took part in a peaceful candlelight vigil in Odorheiu Secuiesc (). This event was organised by the Hungarian Civic Party, took place in a park in the city centre, and featured the reading of a declaration of solidarity with the non-violent protesters in Budapest. Protesters in Odorheiu Secuiesc also expressed their belief that the results of the 2004 referendum on dual citizenship in Hungary were fraudulent. When asked about protesting in front of the Hungarian consulate in Miercurea Ciuc (Hungarian: Cs√≠kszereda), Magyar Civic Union president Jen≈ë Sz√°sz said that this would be futile, that \\"Premier Gyurcs√°ny must resign in Budapest and not in Cs√≠kszereda\\". \\"Budapesta: rebeliunea continuƒÉ\\" , Ziua, 21 September 2006.  Day 3: Wednesday, September 20, 2006  Budapest About 10,000 demonstrators at Kossuth Square ‚Äì 10:54pm, 20 Sep 2006 During the daytime the capital city was peaceful, though ruins and debris from the previous night's clash scenes reminded the citizens that the crisis was far from being over. Daytime announcements from different political personalities all agreed that violence must be avoided and control must be maintained at all reasonable costs. Police leaders promised immediate, zero- tolerance reaction to any turmoil. Identification of violators and troublemakers went on all day by police, via analyzing news videos, and dedicated police/detective units made more than 100 arrests during the afternoon. Riot police were also present at all important scenes, including Parliament, state public radio station, MSZP HQ, and they kept Szabads√°g Square (where the previously sieged state public television resides) tightly sealed. Nobody was allowed to enter the square except residents of its buildings, television staff and law enforcers. Police units were reinforced, equipped with new special full-size shields, steel helmets, bulletproof vests, and gas masks. ...and policemen facing them ‚Äì 10:06pm, 20 Sep 2006 As night fell, reports came in of large scale purchasing of baseball bats at a sports warehouse. Later, a downtown restaurant was raided by the police because delivery of \\"long stick-like objects\\" was witnessed, but these turned out to be merely promotional umbrellas. After 01:00, protesters began to gather on the Grand Boulevard (Nagyk√∂r√∫t), around Nyugati Square and Oktogon Square. About 2,000 people began to walk along Andr√°ssy Avenue, demanding the departure of Gyurcs√°ny. This time there were no serious attacks against policemen or vandalism, but the troops soon stormed over the protesters and pursued them on the Grand Boulevard towards Nyugati Square and neighbouring streets. Cases of police brutality against peaceful protesters and passers-by were reported by eyewitnesses on Internet forums and articles. Indymedia.hu Overall, this night was remarkably controlled by massive police presence and their rapid response, vandalism was mostly prevented and there were no reports of stone-throwing assault or arson. During the night, 62 persons were arrested, of which 55 persons are now in custody and charged with aggressive crimes, bringing the total arrests to over 200. An article on the Hungarian news portal index.hu illustrated with photos the fact that the Lonsdale youth manifesto could be observed during the unrest. Lonsdale divat Other cities Wednesday at St. Stephen Square Early on Wednesday the large window of the Socialist Party's office in Miskolc was smashed with a garbage can. Downtown, several MSZP placards of the upcoming local elections were vandalized. Late afternoon demonstrations started again on St. Stephen Square; police secured both the square and the MSZP office long before the demonstrators arrived. Speakers asked demonstrators to behave themselves and keep the demonstration peaceful. A student of the University of Miskolc informed the people that the university's student council withdrew its approval of the protest against tuition fees, but students would protest anyway. In Debrecen the city's mayor Lajos K√≥sa (Fidesz) was taking an active part of the demonstrations; he supported his party's plans to keep a rally in Budapest on Saturday (the rally had been cancelled since), and heavily criticized G√°bor Demszky, the mayor of Budapest for his perceived inactivity. (\\"It's possible G√°bor Demszky doesn't feel Budapest his own and he thinks that he has nothing to do when such things happen in the capital, but Debrecen is another city, it has a local government which cares for the city.\\" Fidesz website ) He also asked the demonstrators not to attack the MSZP's county headquarters in the city, stating that the building is Debrecen's property and the party is only renting it. (A similar thing happened in Miskolc where a speaker jokingly mentioned that \\"we have the strength to break into the building, but we won't do it; that building will still be useful for something else.\\") A peaceful rally was held in the main square of P√©cs. Other countries *Romania: The Organisation of Transylvanian Magyar Youth held a demonstration on Wednesday at 18:00 in Marosv√°s√°rhely (T√¢rgu-Mure≈ü) to show solidarity with the Budapest protesters. This event took place in the yard of the Reformed Church in the Citadel. The demonstration remained peaceful, and those involved noted that they understood Hungarians' frustration while disagreeing with those who employed violent methods. Similar actions took place in Sz√©kelyudvarhely (Odorheiu Secuiesc), Sepsiszentgy√∂rgy (Sf√¢ntu Gheorghe) and Cs√≠kszereda (Miercurea-Ciuc). *Serbia: A small protest took place in the town of Zenta (Senta) on this day. The demonstration was organised by a local ethnic Hungarian political party. These people wanted to show their sympathy for the demonstrators in Hungary because, in their opinion, all people who peacefully demonstrate on the streets in Hungary had previously voted to give Hungarian citizenship to the ethnic Hungarians in the neighboring countries. Attila Juh√°sz, the mayor of the town, said that he and his party (the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians), which is the most influential ethnic Hungarian party in Serbia, believe that Hungarians in Vojvodina have no business in the Hungarian events. Day 4: Thursday, September 21, 2006 Budapest Peaceful demonstration went on, but people showed markedly less interest. The main opposition party, Fidesz has cancelled its planned rally previously announced for September 23, due to warnings of a possible attack. The demonstrators of Kossuth Square still lacked any serious political support. Police issued arrest warrants against several football ultras and other presumed troublemakers. A leader of a right-wing extremist demonstrator group announced in a local cable TV that he would take full responsibility for any future violence but his group planned no more attacks against the media.(in Hungarian; see post of September 21, 22:24 at Index Hungary) The day and night were quiet overall, but arson was reported when a district office of the Hungarian Socialist Party was set ablaze in √öjpest (a district of Budapest). It was quickly extinguished. Other cities Peaceful demonstrations continued all over the country. Day 5: Friday, September 22, 2006 Budapest The day passed peacefully. The Kossuth Square demonstration carried on, with 10,000 demonstrators in the evening, and featured several speeches. The demonstration was very well supported with food and on-location made meals. The Parliament-outsider right-wing Hungarian Justice and Life Party held its peaceful, speech-oriented rally under heavy police presence. Police leaders announced that they will maintain their alert at the same level as that of the previous days. Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny made his official trip to Berlin, Germany today. He visited the X. International Bertelsmann Forum 2006 of the Bertelsmann Stiftung where he also met the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. After the meeting Gyurcs√°ny claimed that Merkel found his leaked speech to be brave. Later the Chancellor's office denied even mentioning the word \\"brave\\". Other cities Demonstrator In Miskolc demonstrations started on St. Stephen Square as usual, with fewer demonstrators than on previous days. The speaker informed demonstrators about the latest happenings countrywide, then exhorted people to demonstrate every evening at 18:00 on the main squares of cities until the government resigns. He also said that the fundraising to help those who are penalized for taking part in the demonstrations should be held in the whole country, not only in Miskolc. The speaker mentioned that police officers informed him on Thursday that he will be held responsible for any atrocities committed in the city by the demonstrators; because of this he organized a committee of five people who will protect the demonstrators from provocators, remove the demonstrators who try to stir up trouble, and will try to prevent attacks against police officers. Borsod Online The demonstrators took their usual route ‚Äì first to City Hall Square, to the city hall and then to the Alliance of Free Democrats party's county office, where a high school teacher gave a speech comparing Gyurcs√°ny's speech to \\"the opening of Pandora's box\\", then marched through Sz√©chenyi Street towards MSZP's office, and later to Pet≈ëfi Square. Only about 600 people took part in the demonstrations, which was planned to be very short this time, since the local football team, DVTK was playing against Vasas in the Di√≥sgy≈ër district of the city and organizers didn't want football fans joining the demonstrators. The football match could also have been the reason for the low participation in the demonstration. Mentions were made about the demonstrations being continued on the weekend. Fidesz website About 500 people were protesting in Debrecen, 500 in Szeged, 400 in Sz√©cs√©ny, 100‚Äì200 in B√©k√©scsaba, 100‚Äì120 in Salg√≥tarj√°n, 50 in Ny√≠regyh√°za and smaller groups in several other towns. Other countries *Austria: News reported Index Hungary(post of 09.22 21:01) a demonstration of about 60 members of the Hungarian minority living in Austria at the embassy of Hungary in Vienna. After a speech, they handed over their petition to the embassy officials. *Canada: Hungarians living in Toronto announced Fidesz website their intention to hold a peaceful demonstration before the Hungarian consulate in Toronto on September 23 afternoon. *Switzerland: Swiss News Agency reported that Friday afternoon about 60 Hungarians living in Switzerland demonstrated before the embassy in Bern. They declared that Gyurcs√°ny's government was not legitimate from a moral point of view any more. Fidesz website *United States: More than 100 demonstrators demanded Gyurcs√°ny's resignation before the Hungarian consulate in New York City. Fidesz website Some demonstrators travelled from New Jersey and Connecticut to take part in the demonstration. The Hungarian national anthem and Sz√≥zat were sung several times, and the revolutionary poem Nemzeti dal was recited. A demonstration was also held in Los Angeles. Day 6: Saturday, September 23, 2006 Between 20,000 and 50,000 people protested in Budapest. Day 7: Sunday, September 24, 2006 According to MTI (Official Hungarian News Agency) the peaceful demonstration on Kossuth square continued with participation of 10,000 to 12,000. Hungary's newspapers have mixed views. Day 8: Monday, September 25, 2006 Magyar Lobbi (\\"Hungarian Lobby\\"), an organisation of American and European professors and scientists of Hungarian origin, wrote a petition to President L√°szl√≥ S√≥lyom, demanding that he start a no-confidence provision against the government.LOBBY ‚Äì Hungarian Online Resources (Magyar Online Forr√°s) Other associations and organisations (e.g. √öj Magyarorsz√°g√©rt Egyes√ºlet, V√©degylet) in their petitions given to the Civil Office of Parliament demanded starting a conventional assembly. One of these was written by √öj Magyarorsz√°g√©rt Egyes√ºlet and signed by Farkas Bethlen, Andr√°s Hargitay, Andr√°s Kelemen, Imre Makovecz, Mikl√≥s Melocco, J√≥zsef V. Moln√°r, Lajos Papp, Imre Pozsgay, M√°ty√°s Sz≈±r√∂s and L√°szl√≥ T≈ëk√©s. Renovation of MTV hall started. In the country and on Kossuth Square peaceful demonstrations continued, with about 300 participants in Miskolc, 400 in Szeged, 300 in Szeksz√°rd, 4000 on Kossuth Square. The protests also received international coverage ‚Äì Jon Stewart referenced the audio recordings and the protests in The Daily Show, noting that \\"It must be nice to have a democracy so young and idealistic you can still be disappointed in it.\\" Day 9: Tuesday, September 26, 2006 In an open letter published in the maverick newspaper Magyar Nemzet, several public-life people, including former Chairman of the National Bank of Hungary P√©ter √Åkos Bod, former president Ferenc M√°dl and ex-minister J√°nos Martonyi called Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny to resign. Demonstrations continued. Influences on the 2006 municipal elections On October 1, 2006 municipal elections were held in Hungary. In many cities, demonstrators urged people not to vote for the MSZP candidate. In its campaign leaflets and phone calls, Fidesz constantly referred to Gyurcs√°ny's lies. In response, Gyurcs√°ny insisted in a speech he held in Szeged on September 15 Magyar R√°di√≥ that the local elections would have no bearing on his party staying in power, and \\"those who don't want a war between the government and the city should know whom to vote for\\". (He was catcalled.) Turnout in the local elections was 53.1%, which was two points higher than in 2002 National Election Office and the highest for municipal elections since the return to democracy in 1990. Opposition parties booked a clear victory in the elections for county and Budapest assemblies and in the mayoral elections in cities with county rights. However, the polling firm Median opined that the scandal around Gyurcs√°ny's lying had not affected the outcome of the elections as much as it was expected to, as support for MSZP had already hit an all-time low by early September. Figyel≈ëNet Moreover, in Budapest, G√°bor Demszky was re-elected city mayor as SZDSZ/MSZP candidate, and the MSzP retained a plurality of district mayoralties. For fuller detail about the results of the October 2006 local elections, see Elections in Hungary. Further demonstrations Following the elections, demonstrations demanding the government's resignation continued in Budapest (every day until October 23) and in other cities (every week until winter).

On the 50th anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, clashes between protesters and the police were reported. Mounted police charges, tear gas, rubber bullets, and water cannons were used to force back the crowd. Rubber bullets were frequently aimed head-high, causing a large number of injuries; a man lost the sight of one eye due to a rubber bullet. They don't aim head-high with rubber bullets elsewhere, index.hu Events started at 02:00, when Chief of the Budapest Police Force P√©ter Gerg√©nyi decided ‚Äì in opposition to previous agreements with demonstrators ‚Äì to clear out Kossuth Square . The official justification was that the demonstrators \\"obstructed security checking of the square\\". (This was not completely true: hundreds of protesters left the square \\"extemporary\\" to make it easier for the police. Only a grim group of 10‚Äì20 demonstrators led by Ferdin√°nd \\"Satu\\" Lanczer stayed there. They were rounded up by police.) Most of the crowd stopped at N√°dor Street. Gerg√©nyi declared the area an \\"operational zone\\" As L√°szl√≥ K√∂v√©r (Fidesz) and L√°szl√≥ Salamon (KDNP) expressed, laws regulating police don't contain such a concept, so Gerg√©nyi's provisions were and are unconstitutional (Fidesz and MNB 2000 had admittance to reserve the area until October 25). The chief has the right to attack an area, but only in the case of \\"direct threats\\" (catastrophe, terror attack etc.). and prohibited all demonstrations on the square and in its neighborhood \\"as long as necessary\\". A rend≈ërs√©g ki√ºr√≠tette a Kossuth teret Budapest Mayor G√°bor Demszky declared he was not informed about these police actions and \\"at first glance\\" did not agree with them. Police say that no one was injured in this action, but MTI (the official Hungarian News Agency) reported \\"men with bloody heads\\". The peaceful demonstration ended for a while, with smaller (mainly verbal) incidents between police and protesters noted. The indignant crowd was not willing to end protesting; many of them wanted to go back when the security check was finished, but the police started to crowd them out. When this news spread, the crowd began to multiply. Near St. Stephen's Basilica people started to muster again in the morning. Some of them made anti-government signs in English and wanted to take part in the official celebration on Kossuth Square with them, but policemen prohibited it. Finally, the crowd began to march into Corvin Street,A legendary location of 1956 revolution, where anti-Bolshevik resistance battled with Soviet tanks for a long time. because there they could hold a minor, preannounced (and therefore \\"legal\\"There has been a public constitutional debate in Hungary going on for years about whether a demonstration not previously announced to the police may be broken up. The law says police may dissolve it every time, but high-order laws such as the Constitution of the Hungarian Republic or international treaties presumably override it.

Police avoided declaring current demonstrations either legal or illegal all that day (acceding to judicial chaos besides public transport abnormalities), declaring them illegal only the next day, October 24.) celebration. The crowd grew, so H√≠r TV (News Television) reported ten thousand protesters according to \\"non-official police sources.\\"News TV video . The crowd could not decide what to do. Most of them shouted \\"Kossuth Square\\" and \\"Let's go, let's go,\\" and after the celebration started off. On Alkotm√°ny Street they clashed with police forces, which made them retreat to the Cathedral. At about 15:00, police started to dissipate the crowd with tear gas. Protesters acquired an unarmed T-34 tank (a part of the occasional local open-air exhibition) and used it in a charge. After only a few hundred meters the tank driver decided to stop, as he feared he would run over protesters. Its driver (said to be a veteran of 1956) was arrested, no serious damage was done. At Astoria a peaceful celebration of Fidesz started. Despite their readiness (during the previous few days, hundreds of policemen were called in from the country to the city), police did little to defend the crush of radical anti-government protests that took place only 300‚Äì500 metres away and pressed nearer and nearer by police's gas attacks in the wide Erzs√©bet Boulevard. That night and the next day many political analysts and congressmen brought up the idea that this police behaviour was not by chance.Remark 1: As rhetoric of government congressmen, including Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny, it has been reported for months in government media that \\"Fidesz takes politics from the parliament to the streets and it is the accessory of the Hungarian far left.\\" Remark 2: Hungarian laws declare that the police must be loyal to the current government. Fidesz celebration, with a participation of thousands, ended at 18:00. That crowd could not be disbanded at all when police started a horse assault on De√°k Square protesters. They used gun shells too. Victims of the Hungarian Police's actions on 23 October 2006 Vandalism was reported on the side of protesters and police alike. Some vandals broke shop windows while many other protesters tried to prevent them. But evidences show that appearance of police was unprecedentedly brutal and disproportionate to the protest. The police shot gas grenades and rubber bullets in at head- height and didn't sort peaceful celebrants from protesters and provocateurs. Many peaceful passers-by were injured. The fact that police suddenly reduced public transport in many places and directly and indirectly detained celebrators from getting to monuments and protesters from escaping from hot places added to the growing chaos. There are lot of videos showing policemen, after tackling a demonstrator, kicking him., News TV video A detachment of policemen entered a bar on the Blaha Lujza Square, dragged out several customers on the street and subdued them violently, which included breaking the fingers of a handcuffed man, and shooting one in the back with a shot of rubber pellets point-blank.Egy √©tterem vend√©geit is megvert√©khttp://index.hu/politika/belfold/rebisz3309/ Policemen in most of the restaurants and pubs drove in guests (referring to safety risks) or drove them out (referring to that they search for radical demonstrators) and they used foul language. They mistreated not only demonstrators, but bypassers,Photo about a bypasser, shot on his neck with gum-shell when he exited from the underground station on De√°k Square. ambulancemen, foreign tourists, and reporters. Even Parliamentarian M√°riusz R√©v√©sz was shot and beaten when he, showing his MP clearance in his hand, tried to protect their celebration from attacking police forces.News TV: M√°riusz R√©v√©sz Fidesz-congressman injured They ill-treated Jesuit priest L√°szl√≥ V√©rtesaljai.,On October 26 a little group of public place authorities and policemen tried to inhibit unavailingly Hungarian and Polish journalists to interview him: as well as two other priests. The crowd escaped in the direction of the Danube River. In Ferenciek Square and on a bridge over the Danube they built barricades from everything they found (including building operations materials, signposts, iron police cordon elements, cars and buses). The number of injured people grew. Police broke the barricade on the bridge using a snow plow. The riots ended at dawn. 128 people were reported injured, 19 of whom were policemen. At least two men were reported blinded in one eye from the rubber bullets. In the country (e.g. in Szombathely), demonstrations started against \\"police terror\\". Fidesz announces plans for November 4 demonstrations On November 1, main opposition party Fidesz announced their plans to stage several large-scale demonstrations across Hungary on the anniversary of the Soviet suppression of the 1956 Revolution. The events were intended to serve be a memorial to the victims of the Soviet invasion and a protest against police brutality during the October 23 unrest in Budapest. There was a candlelight vigil march across Budapest on the 4th of November. Eventually the demonstrations petered out by the end of the year.Gorondi, Pablo (27 February 2007) \\"Hungary's prime minister expects political tension but no riots on March 15 commemorations\\" Associated Press Worldstream The new round of demonstrations expected in the Spring of 2007 did not materialize. Aftermath The official report on the demonstrations and the attacks on non-violent civilians came out in February 2007. The panel of experts, appointed by Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny, published a 263-page report on the riots which concluded that they were triggered in part by uncertainty about state reforms and exacerbated by the opposition party Fidesz's call for Gyurcs√°ny to resign which represented an attempt to \\"overthrow\\" the government and \\"jeopardized parliamentary democracy.\\" The commission further said that the use of force by the police was justified, but officers acted too aggressively. The commission recommended that (1) no amnesty be given to those serving sentences for violence during the riots, that (2) police be banned from using bullets to disperse crowds, that (3) only specially trained police be used for crowd control, and that (4) a 1989 law banning public gatherings near parliament and demonstrations lasting more than 24 hours be reinstated. A spokesman for Fidesz said the commission was biased in favor of the government.Benczenleitner, Palma (6 February 2007) \\"Official report on 2006 Hungary riots blames politicians, police\\" Associated Press Worldstream On 20 May 2007, Prime Minister Gyurcs√°ny announced the resignations of Justice Minister J√≥zsef Petr√©tei, National Police Chief L√°szl√≥ Bene and Budapest Police Chief P√©ter Gerg√©nyi. Gyurcs√°ny said the move is intended to restore public confidence in Hungary's police and justice systems. News stories attribute the move to recent police scandals and the cloud cast by the disproportionate use of force during the 2006 anti-government demonstrations.Bos, Stefan (20 May 2007) \\"VOA News: Hungarian Minister, Police Leaders Resign Amid Corruption Charges\\" US Fed News  See also  *Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny's speech in Balaton≈ësz√∂d in May 2006 *Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny References External links *Excerpts: Hungarian 'lies' speech ‚Äì BBC *Blog about the riots in Budapest  *Hungarian protests Q&A; ‚Äì BBC.

After Sierra's eponymous debut album failed to achieve commercial success, Guilbeau, Hill, Kleinow and Sierra drummer Mickey McGee reunited with Skip Battin and Gene Parsons (playing guitar due to a wrist injury) and began to tour as the Flying Burrito Brothers again. By 1979, Greg Harris and Ed Ponder were hired to replace Joel Scott Hill and Mickey McGee respectively. During this time, Gene Parsons also left the group and was not replaced. This shuffled lineup of the band released Live from Tokyo on Tennessee-based Regency Records to public and critical indifference, however the album's single, a cover of Merle Haggard's \\"White Line Fever\\", reached the lower-end of the US country music charts (the first Burritos single ever to enter the charts). This would mark the beginning of a three-year stretch of commercial success for the band. Rerelease In 1991, the album was released on CD on Relix Records under the original name Close Encounters on the West Coast. The re-release also features the original art- work.

The route begins at PA 441 in Marietta and heads east to U.S. Route 1 (US 1) at City Avenue on the border of Lower Merion Township and Philadelphia. PA 23 begins at Marietta in Lancaster County and continues east to Lancaster, where it passes through the city on a one-way pair and intersects US 222 and US 30. East of Lancaster, the route passes through agricultural areas in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, serving Leola, New Holland, and Blue Ball, where it crosses US 322. PA 23 passes through the southern tip of Berks County and serves Morgantown, where a ramp provides access to Interstate 176 (I-176). The route runs through northern Chester County and serves Elverson, Bucktown, Phoenixville, and Valley Forge. PA 23 continues into Montgomery County and intersects US 422 in King of Prussia and US 202 in Bridgeport. The route follows the Schuylkill River to West Conshohocken, where it has access to I-76 and I-476, before it continues southeast through Lower Merion Township to US 1. PA 23 was first designated in 1927 between US 230 in Lancaster and City Avenue on the Lower Merion Township/Philadelphia border. The route was extended east to US 30 (Girard Avenue) in West Philadelphia via Conshohocken Avenue and Belmont Avenue in the 1930s. PA 23 was rerouted to use Gulph Road through Valley Forge Park by 1945, with PA 23 Truck designated to bypass the route to the north and east by 1950. PA 23 Alternate (PA 23 Alt.) was designated as an alternate alignment in Lower Merion Township in 1937. PA 23 was moved to its current alignment between Valley Forge and Bala Cynwyd by 1967, replacing parts of PA 363 between Valley Forge and Port Kennedy and PA 320 between Bridgeport and West Conshohocken. The alternate and truck routes were also decommissioned at this time. The route was extended west from Lancaster to Marietta by 1970, replacing a part of PA 340; the route was also moved onto a one-way pair in Lancaster. The eastern terminus was moved to its current location in the 1980s. PA 23 was rerouted to its current alignment in the eastern part of Lancaster in 1992, bypassing New Holland Avenue. A PA 23 freeway was proposed east of Lancaster in the 1960s; parts of the road were built before construction stopped. The road was turned over to farmers and is known as the \\"Goat Path\\". A two-lane bypass of PA 23 east of Lancaster was later proposed before being shelved in 2010. A freeway between US 422 and US 202 in Upper Merion Township called the Schuylkill Parkway was planned in the 1960s; a small stub in Bridgeport was built in 1972 before funding issues halted the project. Route description Lancaster County PA 23 begins at an intersection with PA 441 on the eastern edge of the borough of Marietta in Lancaster County, heading east on two-lane undivided Marietta Avenue into East Donegal Township. The road runs through a mix of farmland and trees with some residences, crossing Chiques Creek into West Hempfield Township. The route continues through rural land with some housing developments as Marietta Pike, passing through the community of Silver Spring. PA 23 runs through farm fields with some residential and commercial development and crosses into East Hempfield Township at the Stony Battery Road intersection in the community of Oyster Point. The road continues through development with some farmland, coming to bridges over the US 30 freeway without an interchange and Norfolk Southern's Columbia Secondary. The route passes homes in the community of Rohrerstown and reaches an intersection with PA 741. PA 23 runs through wooded residential areas and enters Lancaster Township upon crossing Little Conestoga Creek. The route becomes Marietta Avenue, running through the community of School Lane Hills and curving to the southeast. The road passes to the north of Wheatland, the former home of President James Buchanan, before it enters the city of Lancaster and becomes city-maintained. Upon entering Lancaster, PA 23 intersects the westbound direction of PA 462 at Race Avenue. Here, the route splits into a one-way pair, with the eastbound direction of PA 23 continuing along two-way Marietta Avenue and the westbound direction of PA 23 becoming concurrent with westbound PA 462 on one-way West Walnut Street, carrying two lanes. Two blocks later, near Lancaster Regional Medical Center, eastbound PA 23 splits from Marietta Avenue onto one-way eastbound West Chestnut Street, with two lanes. The route follows West Chestnut Street eastbound and West Walnut Street westbound, continuing concurrent with PA 462 westbound, passing through residential areas of the city. Eastbound PA 462 is located two blocks south of eastbound PA 23 along King Street. The route heads into the commercial downtown of Lancaster, where it intersects one-way southbound US 222/PA 272 at North Prince Street. A short distance later, PA 23 crosses one-way northbound PA 72 at North Queen Street. Past this intersection, the route becomes East Chestnut Street eastbound and East Walnut Street westbound, intersecting one-way northbound US 222/PA 272 at North Lime Street at the east end of downtown. Following this, PA 23 passes more homes and industrial establishments in the eastern part of the city. At North Broad Street, westbound PA 462 splits from westbound PA 23, and the two directions of PA 23 merge a short distance later onto four-lane, divided East Walnut Street, which is state-maintained. The route curves northeast through wooded areas with some nearby development, passing through a corner of Manheim Township before crossing under the Conestoga Creek Viaduct that carries Amtrak's Keystone Corridor over the route and the Conestoga River immediately to the east. The road continues north into Lancaster again before it turns northeast into Manheim Township and crosses the Conestoga River back into Lancaster. PA 23 comes to an interchange with the US 30 freeway, where it turns northwest for a concurrency with a dead end stub heading northeast. PA 23 eastbound in Upper Leacock Township PA 23 follows US 30 along a four-lane freeway and crosses the Conestoga River into Manheim Township. After the river, PA 23 splits from US 30 at a diamond interchange and heads northeast onto New Holland Pike, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The route passes through wooded residential areas to the west of a golf course in the community of Eden. The road narrows to two lanes and curves east to cross the Conestoga River into East Lampeter Township, passing through the community of Holland Heights. At this point, the route enters the Pennsylvania Dutch Country of eastern Lancaster County, which is home to many Amish farms. PA 23 continues into Upper Leacock Township and passes through a mix of farmland and residential and commercial development, passing north of the Lancaster County Christian School and running through the community of Geist and Leacock, where it becomes West Main Street. The route reaches the community of Leola, where PA 772 joins for a short concurrency before it splits to the southeast. The road becomes East Main Street and is lined with more homes and businesses with nearby farmland as it continues east through the community of Bareville. PA 23 becomes the border between West Earl Township to the north and Upper Leacock Township to the south before it enters Earl Township in the community of Groffdale. The road becomes West Main Street and curves northeast past residential and commercial development, crossing into the borough of New Holland. The route becomes lined with homes and passes through the commercial downtown, where it becomes East Main Street. PA 23 runs past more residences before entering commercial areas, passing to the south of Garden Spot High School and crossing back into Earl Township. The route enters East Earl Township and runs past a mix of farmland, homes, and businesses as Main Street, crossing US 322 in the community of Blue Ball. PA 23 continues east past more development and intersects PA 897, with that route joining PA 23 for a short concurrency before it heads south. Past this, PA 23 enters agricultural areas and intersects the southern terminus of PA 625. The road runs through more farmland, passing through the residential community of Goodville before it enters Caernarvon Township. The route crosses the Conestoga River and runs through Churchtown. The road curves north-northeast through more rural areas, passing north of Conestoga Christian School before coming to an intersection with PA 10. Here, PA 10 becomes concurrent with PA 23 on a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane, heading into commercial areas. Berks and Chester counties The road crosses into Caernarvon Township in Berks County and intersects a ramp that heads north to provide access to northbound I-176 and from southbound I-176. The two routes continue into the community of Morgantown as a two-lane road and pass homes. PA 10 splits from PA 23 by turning north onto Morgantown Road, and PA 23 continues east past more homes and some businesses. The route comes to a bridge over the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76) and passes through farmland with some commercial development, coming to a junction with the western terminus of PA 401. PA 23 westbound past PA 29 in Phoenixville A short distance past the PA 401 intersection, PA 23 enters the borough of Elverson in Chester County as Main Street, passing homes and intersecting the northern terminus of PA 82. The route leaves Elverson for West Nantmeal Township, where it becomes Ridge Road and heads into a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. The road soon enters Warwick Township, where it reaches a junction with PA 345 in the community of Warwick. PA 23 continues through wooded areas with some fields and residences, passing to the south of the community of Saint Peters, where it crosses French Creek, and running to the north of Warwick County Park. The route crosses into South Coventry Township and passes through the community of Coventryville before it intersects PA 100 in Bucktown. The road passes south of Owen J. Roberts High School before it crosses into East Vincent Township and continues through a mix of fields, woods, and homes, soon entering East Coventry Township. PA 23 curves southeast and crosses back into East Vincent Township and runs through more rural land with some residences, passing to the north of a golf course. The route enters East Pikeland Township and passes near residential neighborhoods before it intersects the eastern terminus of PA 724. At this point, PA 23 turns south onto Schuylkill Road, passing businesses and curving to the southeast. The route becomes the border between the borough of Phoenixville to the northeast and Schuylkill Township to the southwest and crosses French Creek before passing more businesses and intersecting PA 113. At this point, PA 113 turns southeast to form a concurrency with PA 23 on Nutt Road, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane that fully enters Phoenixville. The road passes businesses and crosses under an abandoned railroad line, at which point it continues through residential areas. PA 113 splits from PA 23 by heading northeast on two-lane Bridge Street, while PA 23 continues southeast on two-lane Nutt Road. The route runs through residential areas with some businesses and passes to the northeast of Phoenixville Hospital before crossing PA 29. The road passes more suburban development and crosses into Schuylkill Township, where it becomes Valley Forge Road and curves to the east. PA 23 crosses Pickering Creek at the dam forming Pickering Creek Reservoir to the south and turns southeast through wooded areas of residential development. The route reaches the community of Valley Forge, where it curves east and enters Valley Forge National Historical Park, the site where General George Washington and the Continental Army made an important winter encampment during the American Revolutionary War. Montgomery County PA 23 westbound through Valley Forge National Historical Park Upon crossing Valley Creek, PA 23 enters Upper Merion Township in Montgomery County and intersects the northern terminus of PA 252. The route becomes Valley Forge Park Road and intersects Gulph Road to the south of Washington's Headquarters. The road continues east through fields and woods within Valley Forge National Historical Park, passing near the Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben statue and Washington Memorial Chapel. PA 23 curves south and intersects North Gulph Road near the park's Visitor Center, at which point the route turns east onto four-lane divided Valley Forge Road and immediately comes to an interchange with the US 422 freeway. The route passes between residential high rise buildings to the north and business parks to the south, narrowing into a two-lane undivided road and heading northeast. The road turns southeast and crosses Trout Creek, passing near more business parks and widening back to a four-lane divided highway. PA 23 turns northeast onto four- lane, undivided, township-maintained Geerdes Boulevard briefly, with Allendale Road turning southeast, before heading east on two-lane, undivided, state- maintained Valley Forge Road. The route winds east through suburban residential neighborhoods in King of Prussia, intersecting Henderson Road. The road passes near more homes before reaching a bridge over the unused Schuylkill Parkway freeway stub. PA 23 passes under the Dannehower Bridge, which carries southbound US 202 over the route and the Schuylkill River to the north, and curves south into the borough of Bridgeport. Here, the route comes to an intersection with the Schuylkill Parkway, which provides a connection to the route from southbound US 202, and turns east onto a four-lane divided highway, passing to the south of industrial development and crossing under SEPTA's Norristown High Speed Line. PA 23 intersects northbound US 202 at Dekalb Street in the commercial center of Bridgeport and continues east past urban homes and businesses on two-lane undivided West 4th Street. The route becomes East 4th Street and passes near more neighborhoods and some industrial development, curving southeast. PA 23 westbound in West Conshohocken PA 23 turns east onto Coates Street and forms the border between Bridgeport to the north and Upper Merion Township to the south. The route curves southeast into Upper Merion Township and becomes Schuylkill River Road, running between homes to the southwest and Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line and the Schuylkill River parallel to the northeast. The road passes under the Schuylkill River Bridge, which carries the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276), and Norfolk Southern's Dale Secondary, continuing south through a mix of woodland and industrial areas further west of the river and the railroad tracks and passing to the east of a quarry. In Swedeland, PA 23 gains a second westbound lane and intersects the northern terminus of PA 320. The road curves southeast past more industry, narrowing to two lanes and crossing an Upper Merion and Plymouth Railroad spur at-grade before entering the borough of West Conshohocken. Here, the route becomes Front Street and becomes closely parallel to the Harrisburg Line and the Schuylkill River again, passing under the bridge that carries I-476 over the river. PA 23 passes through PECO's West Conshohocken Gas Operations Center before it crosses Gulph Creek. Following this, the route runs past homes and intersects Fayette Street/Matsonford Road near several high-rise office buildings. Fayette Street heads northeast across the river to Conshohocken and Matsonford Road southwest to provide access to the Schuylkill Expressway (I-76) and I-476. Past this, the route becomes Crawford Avenue and curves to the east past commercial development. The road turns south and becomes Conshohocken State Road, passing under I-76. PA 23 enters Lower Merion Township and curves southeast, passing through forested areas of residential development. At the Spring Mill Road intersection, the route becomes township-maintained and winds its way southeast. The road heads through the community of Gladwyne, where it passes homes and a few businesses, before it crosses Mill Creek and makes a turn to the north and a curve southeast in wooded areas. At Hollow Road, PA 23 becomes state-maintained again and winds southeast through more shaded residential areas. The route comes to Bala Cynwyd, where it intersects Montgomery Avenue and Bala Avenue and turns east to follow four-lane, township-maintained Conshohocken State Road. PA 23 passes over SEPTA's Cynwyd Line near its terminus at the Cynwyd station and turns southeast past more homes. The route enters commercial areas and reaches its eastern terminus at US 1 (City Avenue) on the border of Lower Merion Township in Montgomery County and the city of Philadelphia in Philadelphia County, at which point Conshohocken Avenue continues into Philadelphia.  History  Designation PA 23 eastbound approaching its terminus at US 1 in Lower Merion Township The road between Marietta and Lancaster was chartered as a private turnpike called the Lancaster, New Haven, and Waterford Turnpike in 1805, later being known as the Lancaster and Marietta Turnpike. What would become PA 23 between Lancaster and New Holland was chartered as the New Holland and Lancaster Turnpike on March 20, 1810. The Morgantown, Churchtown, and Blue Ball Turnpike was chartered on February 25, 1814. This turnpike, which was built along the Horse-Shoe Road and ran between the Downingtown and Harrisburg Turnpike at Blue Ball and Little Conestoga in Morgantown, was finished in 1819. When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what would become PA 23 was designated as Legislative Route 244 between Leacock and Morgantown and Legislative Route 201 between Phoenixville and King of Prussia. In 1927, PA 23 was designated to run from US 230/PA 41/PA 72 (Prince Street) in Lancaster east to City Avenue on the border of Philadelphia. The route followed Walnut Street and New Holland Avenue before continuing along its current alignment between Lancaster and Port Kennedy, where it ran southeast along Gulph Road and Old Gulph Road before turning east along Spring Mill Road and southeast along Morris Avenue, Williamson Road, Old Gulph Road, Mill Creek Road, Conshohocken State Road, and Bala Avenue. When first designated, the entire length of the route was paved. The route between Marietta and Lancaster was an unnumbered road that was paved by 1930. The present route between Bridgeport and Swedeland was designated as part of PA 123 in 1928. In the 1930s, PA 23 was extended east to US 30 (Girard Avenue) in West Philadelphia, following Conshohocken Avenue and Belmont Avenue. By 1940, the road between Marietta and Lancaster became part of an extended PA 340. By 1945, PA 23 was rerouted to pass through Valley Forge Park along Gulph Road, with an extended PA 363 replacing the route on Valley Forge Road and PA 652 replacing the designation between PA 363 and Gulph Road. By 1950, PA 23 Truck was designated as a truck bypass of the section along Gulph Road through Valley Forge Park, running concurrent with PA 363 on Valley Forge Road before turning south along former PA 652. In addition, PA 23 Alt. was designated as an alternate alignment in Lower Merion Township following Montgomery Avenue. The current alignment between US 202 in Bridgeport and Spring Mill Road in Lower Merion Township became a northern extension of PA 320 by 1960. By 1967, PA 23 was moved to its current alignment between Valley Forge and Bala Cynwyd. The route replaced PA 363 and PA 23 Truck along Valley Forge Road through Valley Forge Park and replaced PA 320 between Bridgeport and Spring Mill Road. By 1970, PA 23 was extended west from US 222/PA 72 in Lancaster to PA 441 in Marietta, replacing PA 340. In Lancaster, the route was moved to a one-way pair following Chestnut Street eastbound and Walnut Street westbound between College Avenue and Plum Street. In the 1970s, the west end of the one-way pair in Lancaster was shifted to Race Street while westbound PA 462 was designated concurrent with westbound PA 23 on Walnut Street, shifting from Orange Street. The eastern terminus of PA 23 was cut back from US 30 (Girard Avenue) to US 1 (City Avenue) in Philadelphia in the 1980s. In 1992, the four lane-road connecting the east end of Chestnut and Walnut streets to the US 30 freeway in Lancaster was built, and PA 23 was rerouted off New Holland Avenue to follow Chestnut and Walnut streets east before continuing northeast on the four-lane road and northwest on the US 30 freeway over the Conestoga River to rejoin New Holland Pike. Freeway proposals The Schuylkill Parkway freeway stub in Bridgeport In the 1960s, plans were made to build a freeway for PA 23 between US 30 and PA 772 in Lancaster County. Construction began, but was stopped due to funding issues and public opposition. In 1977, the right-of-way for the freeway was planted over and leased to area farmers, becoming known as the \\"Goat Path\\". Traces of the incomplete freeway remain, including bridges over and under local roads, grading for the roadway, and an incomplete interchange with PA 772. Despite the cancellation of the freeway, plans continued for capacity improvements on the PA 23 corridor in eastern Lancaster County due to increased traffic levels. Two proposed alternatives existed to build a new two-lane alignment of PA 23 east of Lancaster. The Bareville Connector Alternative would build a new two-lane PA 23 between the US 30 interchange east of the Conestoga River and Bareville, following the Goat Path and having access to Greenfield Road, Horseshoe Road, and PA 772. In addition, a two-lane Industrial Connector would be built between PA 23 in Bareville and Diller Avenue in New Holland. The Southern Alternative would build a new two-lane PA 23 between the US 30 interchange east of the Conestoga River and US 322 in Blue Ball. The route would utilize the Goat Path and have access to Greenfield Road, Horseshoe Road, PA 772, Diller Avenue, New Holland Road, Ranck Road, and Rancks Church Road. The proposed two-lane bypass would have cost $100 million. In 2010, the project was shelved after PennDOT determined it needed the money to repair structurally deficient bridges. Plans were made in the late 1960s to build the Schuylkill Parkway, a freeway bypass of PA 23 between US 422 and US 202 in Upper Merion Township. In 1972, overhead traffic signals were installed and a portion of the road was built west from US 202 and PA 23 in Bridgeport. Construction was halted after PennDOT ran out of funds to construct the road. The short freeway stub of the Schuylkill Parkway that was built became known as \\"The Road to Nowhere\\". In 2002, the Schuylkill Parkway was incorporated into new plans to build a bypass of PA 23 in Upper Merion Township, this time as a surface road that would connect and improve existing roads. Nothing has come from these plans so far. The Schuylkill Parkway freeway stub has been used as a filming location as well as for training emergency vehicle drivers and for commercial vehicle driver tests. Major intersections Special routes King of Prussia alternate truck route Pennsylvania Route 23 Alternate Truck (PA 23 Alt. Truck) is a truck route around a weight-restricted bridge over the Trout Creek in Upper Merion Township, on which trucks over 32 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. The route follows Gulph Road, US 202, and Henderson Road. It was signed in 2013. Former Phoenixville alternate truck route Pennsylvania Route 23 Alternate Truck (PA 23 Alt. Truck) was a truck route around a formerly weight-restricted bridge over the French Creek in Phoenixville, on which trucks over 22 tons and combination loads over 26 tons were prohibited. The route followed PA 724, Bridge Street, Main Street, Township Line Road, and US 422. It was signed in 2013 and decommissioned by Fall 2017 with the rehabilitation of the bridge over French Creek allowing for the removal of the weight restriction. Former Lower Merion alternate route Pennsylvania Route 23 Alternate (PA 23 Alt.) was an alternate route of PA 23 in Montgomery County. The route began at PA 23 (Gulph Road) in Upper Merion Township and headed southeast on Montgomery Avenue into Lower Merion Township, reaching an intersection with PA 320. PA 23 Alt. continued southeast and passed through Narberth before it ended at another intersection with PA 23 (Conshohocken State Road) in Bala Cynwyd. PA 23 Alt. was designated in 1937. The alternate route was decommissioned in 1967, with PA 320 replacing the route north of Spring Mill Road. Former Valley Forge truck route Pennsylvania Route 23 Truck (PA 23 Truck) was a truck route around the section of PA 23 that followed Gulph Road through Valley Forge Park. The truck route began at PA 23 near the community of Valley Forge and headed east concurrent with PA 363 on Valley Forge Road. At Port Kennedy, PA 363 turned north and PA 23 Truck headed south to rejoin PA 23 near King of Prussia. PA 23 Truck was designated by 1950, following PA 363 along Valley Forge Road and replacing PA 652 between Port Kennedy and King of Prussia. The truck route was decommissioned in 1967, with PA 23 replacing the route along with PA 363 on Valley Forge Road and the route east of there becoming a rerouted PA 363 on North Gulph Road.

Surge channel at Cronulla, New South Wales A surge channel is a narrow inlet, usually on a rocky shoreline, and is formed by differential erosion of those rocks by coastal wave action. As waves strike the shore, water fills the channel, and drains out again as the waves retreat. The narrow confines of the channel create powerful currents that reverse themselves rapidly as the water level rises and falls, and cause violent hydrodynamic mixing. However, there is relatively little exchange of water between channels; experimental studies and mathematical modelling of the coastline near Hopkins Marine Station in California have shown that water is rapidly mixed within each channel, but that it mostly moves in an oscillatory manner. Surge channels have been likened to 'containment vessels', retaining water borne gametes and probably enhancing the effectiveness of external fertilisation of marine species dwelling within them. Surge channels can form in reefs, and the term is sometimes also applied to breaches of coastal dunes by storms. Surge channels can range from a few inches across to ten feet or more across. They may create tide pools if the conditions are suitable, but the rapid water movement typically creates a dangerous situation for people or animals that are caught by the current. The West Coast Trail on the coast of Vancouver Island is known for its large number of surge channels, some of which are impassable even at low tide and must be crossed inland.

Renmin University of China Law School is also considered one of the best law schools in the world, and it was ranked 93rd in THE Rankings by Subjects and 51-100th in the QS Rankings by Subjects in \\"Law and Legal Studies\\" subjects respectively. Its current dean is Wang Yi. After its founding in 1950, RUC Law School became the first institution of higher legal education in the People's Republic of China and, as such, is dubbed by many as the \\"cradle\\" nurturing China's most outstanding jurists. RUC Law School inherited the vaunted tradition of the former Chaoyang University when the two schools merged shortly after the founding of the PRC. Established in 1912, Chaoyang University became so synonymous with legal practice in China that the saying went: ‚Äúno Chaoyang, no courts‚Äù. Chaoyang University's legacy of producing nationally recognized jurists endures in the RUC Law School of today where students and faculty continue to lead the development of China's legal system. Since 1950, more than 20,000 students have graduated from RUC Law School, while more than 300,000 jurists have received training from the Law School as continuing education students, judges, procurators, lawyers, university faculty members, and civil servants. A significant number of alumni have become leaders in advancing China's rule of law as government officials, judges, academics, public interest and corporate lawyers. At present, RUC Law School educates more than 3,000 students annually with graduate students accounting for approximately 80% of the student body. The Law School confers undergraduate (LL.B.) and graduate degrees (LL.D. and LL.M.) in all secondary disciplines of law, including one national first-level key discipline and four national second-level key disciplines. RUC Law School also offers a bachelor's degree in Law with a concentration in Intellectual Property Rights. Authorized by the State Council of China, the Law School established the nation's first post-doctoral research center covering all doctoral subject areas. RUC Law School's 43 research institutes carry-out numerous projects of national‚Äîand international‚Äîimportance. These research institutes include two Ministry of Education sponsored humanities and social science research centers, the Research Center for Criminal Jurisprudence, the Research Center of Civil & Commercial Jurisprudence, and the RUC Center for Disabled Person's Law & Legal Services. RUC Law School's expansive library houses more than 300,000 volumes, including over 50,000 foreign language sources. There are over 1,300 Chinese and 3,000 foreign law journals available to students, faculty and visiting scholars. RUC Law School edits and publishes the nation's leading law journal, the Jurists' Review, as well as the RUC Law Review and the Chaoyang Law Review. The Law School also publishes an internationally distributed English law journal, Frontiers of Law in China, which connects an English readership with the swiftly shifting trends that define China's contemporary legal landscape. In efforts to make our scholarship more readily available to an increasingly internet-based society, the Law School runs a nationally recognized website entitled ‚ÄòChina Civil & Commercial Law‚Äô. As part of the Law School's ongoing commitment to serving the public good, professors in RUC Law School have advised the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the National People's Congress Standing Committee.

He played both hurling and Gaelic football with his local club Nemo Rangers and was a member of the Cork senior inter-county teams in both codes from 1972 until 1989. Allen is regarded as one of the greatest Gaelic footballers of all-time. Playing career Club Allen played his club football with the famous Nemo Rangers club in Cork and enjoyed much success. He secured his first senior county championship winners' medal in 1970 as 'Nemo' trounced west Cork side Dohenys. The club's march to success continued later in the year as the club captured the Munster club title following a three-game saga with Kerry champions Austin Stacks. Nemo Rangers werelater trounced in the All-Ireland semi-final. After surrendering their county title in 1976, Nemo were back the following year with Allen picking up a second county winners' medal. A third county championship of the decade followed in 1978 before Allen collected a second Munster club title. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Nemo against Scotstown of Monaghan. Snow hampered the game, however, Cogan proved the hero as Nemo won the game by 2‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì3. It was his first All-Ireland club winners' medal. In 1981 Allen won his fourth county championship title following a 3‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì6 defeat of Bantry Blues. A third Munster club winners' medal quickly followed before Allen lined out in another All-Ireland final. Mayo champions Garrymore provided the opposition, however, Nemo were far too powerful. Allen scored 2‚Äì2 in the first half and the Cork champs had an extraordinary 5‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì1 lead at the interval. Nemo went on to secure a record 6‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì8 victory and Allen collected a second All-Ireland winners' medal.The GAA Book of Lists p. 419 After losing out in 1982, Nemo were back in 1983 and Allen won his fifth county championship winners' medal. A fourth Munster club title soon followed before another All-Ireland final appearance beckoned. Walterstown provided the opposition, however, Nemo proved to be the masters again. Allen engineered two goal chances for Ephie FitzGerald as the Cork champions sealed a 2‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì5 victory. The win gave Allen a third All-Ireland club title.The GAA Book of Lists p. 420 Nemo Rangers went into a slight decline following this victory. The club bounced back in 1987 with Allen winning his sixth county championship winners' medal. A fifth provincial club title quickly followed, however, Nemo were subsequently defeated in the All-Ireland semi- final. Allen secured a seventh county championship title in 1988 as Duhallow fell in the championship decider. He later picked up his sixth Munster club winners' medal as Nemo completely dominated the inter-county club championship again. Another All-Ireland final beckoned, this time with Roscommon champions Clan na Gael providing the opposition. Eoin O'Mahoney's free-taking helped Nemo to victory and Allen ended his club football career with a fourth All- Ireland winners' medal.The GAA Book of Lists p. 421 Inter-county Allen first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork under-21 football team in the early 1970s. He captured a Munster title in this grade in 1971 following a two-goal defeat of Cork. Allen's side later qualified for the All-Ireland final with Fermanagh providing the opposition. A 3‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì3 score line gave Cork the victory and gave Allen an All-Ireland under-21 winners' medal. That year he also helped Cork win the Munster Junior Championship. Allen made his senior debut for Cork in the 1972 Munster final. Cork were defeated on that occasion, however, Allen was singled out as one of Cork football's rising stars. That same year he also played soccer with Cork Hibernians, going on to win an FAI Cup winners' medal in 1973. He showed great promise as a soccer player, however, he remained in Ireland in spite of being offered the chance to play for Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. This involvement in soccer was allegedly frowned upon by some in the Gaelic Athletic Association. Because of this Allen lost his place on the Cork panel for 1973. That year Cork claimed both the Munster and All-Ireland titles, however, Allen had missed out. Two years later in 1975 Allen returned to the Cork GAA set-up, this time as a member of the senior inter-county team. He captured a Munster winners' medal that year following the provincial final trouncing of Limerick.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 26 Cork, however, were defeated by surprise package Galway in the subsequent All-Ireland semi- final. This defeat brought Allen's hurling involvement to an end. Unfortunately for Allen, Cork went on to win the next three All-Ireland titles. The following year Allen was appointed captain of the Cork senior football team. It was unfortunate for Allen that his senior inter-county football career coincided with the era of the greatest Kerry football team of all-time. Cork lost eight consecutive Munster finals between 1975 and 1982. For a while it looked as if fate would result in Allen ending his career without any success with the footballers. In 1983 Kerry were aiming to capture a record-breaking ninth Munster title in-a-row. Cork had different ideas and provided stern opposition. At the full-time whistle Cork were the champions by the narrowest of margins. After eighth consecutive provincial final defeats, the 3‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì9 score line finally gave Allen a Munster winners' medal. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final pitted Cork against Dublin. That game ended in a draw and the replay was played at P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh. In spite of Allen scoring two goals Cork were outclassed on that occasion as 'the Dubs' won by 4‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì10. Kerry reclaimed their provincial title in 1984 and it looked as if Allen's career was drawing to a close. That same year he was named on a special team to mark the centenary year of the Gaelic Athletic Association. Allen was named in the left corner-forward position on the Football Team of the Century, made up of player swho never won a senior All-Ireland medal. In 1986 Allen was dropped from the panel. He was recalled to the side two years later in 1988 at the age of 36 and captured a second Munster winners' medal following a narrow 1‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì16 win over arch-rivals Kerry. Cork later qualified for the All-Ireland final with Meath providing the opposition. Cork stormed ahead after just three minutes when Teddy McCarthy scored the only goal of five consecutive All-Ireland final appearances for Cork. Meath fought back and secured a 0‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì9 draw. The replay proved to be a tough, controversial affair with Meath reduced to fourteen men with the sending off of Gerry McEntee. In spite of being outnumbered Meath still won the game by 0‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì12.The GAA Book of Lists p. 407 Following this result Allen contemplated retiring from inter-county football, however, after another impressive campaign with Nemo Rangers he was persuaded by Billy Morgan to stay on for another year. His decision bore fruit as he was rewarded with the captaincy of the team. 1989 began well with Allen playing a key role in helping Cork to claim the National League title. He later added a third Munster medal to his collection following another win over Kerry. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Mayo play Cork in a unique pairing. Cork were on top for much of the game, however, a goal by substitute Anthony Finnerty gave Mayo a brief lead. Mayo failed to score for the last nineteen minutes as Teddy McCarthy took over and gave a masterful display at midfield. Cork held on to win the game by 0‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì11.The GAA Book of Lists pp. 407‚Äì408 Seventeen years after he first lined out for Cork Allen had finally collected a senior All-Ireland winners' medal. He also had the honour of accepting the Sam Maguire Cup on behalf of his county. Allen retired from inter-county football following this triumph.

In 1017 Cnut married Emma of Normandy, but there is no evidence that √Ülfgifu was repudiated, and in 1030 Cnut sent her and Svein as regents to rule Norway. However, their rule was considered oppressive by the Norwegians. They imposed new taxes and harsh laws that made them unpopular and they were expelled in 1034.Pauline Stafford, \\"√Ülfgifu of Northampton\\", Oxford Online Dictionary of Biography, 2004M. K.

Names Svein Knutsson is also mentioned as Sveinn Alf√≠fuson (matronym) and under the epithet √≥forsynjukonungr (\\"unforeseen king\\"). In Norwegian, his name is Svein Knutsson; in Danish, Svend Knudsen. Many variations of the name are used, including Sven and Sweyn, from the Anglo-Saxon Swegen. He was the second ruler of Norway by this name, after his grandfather Sweyn Forkbeard. Biography In 1029 H√•kon Eiriksson, Cnut's vassal ruler of Norway, was lost at sea and Olaf Haraldsson, who had been deposed as king of Norway by Cnut, tried to recapture the kingdom, but he was defeated and killed at the Battle of Stiklestad. Cnut then sent Svein and √Ülfgifu to Norway, with √Ülfgifu ruling as regent on behalf of her fourteen- year-old son.Ango-Saxon England (Frank Stenton, Oxford University Press, 3rd Edition 1971, p. 398.) This came as a great disappointment to a number of Norwegians who had wished to take the place of the Earls of Lade (Ladejarls). Nobles like Einar Tambarskjelve and Kalv Arnesson were especially disappointed because they both believed that Cnut had promised they could take power. The 1030s were difficult years in Europe. Danish policy in Norway changed ‚Äì there was closer royal involvement and strict regulations in many areas. This created the basis of a popular resistance against the new regime which can be characterised as being of the same ilk as that which Saint Olav had earlier come up against. According to the Sagas, √Ülfgifu's and Svein's tax-demands and new laws created resentment. Snorri writes that \\"King Svein brought in new laws on many subjects. They were modelled on Danish laws but some were much stricter. No man was allowed to leave the country without the King's permission; if he did so his property would become the King's. A person who committed murder would lose the right to land and property. If an outlaw was due an inheritance, the King would take it. At Christmas every farmer had to give the king a measure (between 15 and 20 litres) of malt from every hearth and the thigh of a three-year-old ox, this was called vinjartodde (land tax) in Old Norse, and also a bucket of butter.\\"Snorri Sturlasson: Heimskringla, Life of St. Olaf ¬ß240 According to the Heimskringla, the Battle of Soknasund occurred during 1033 in Ryfylke. Tryggve the Pretender came with an army from England. He said he was the son of Olav Tryggvason and therefore claimed the kingdom as his own. When word reached Sveinn Alf√≠fuson and Aelgifu that Tryggve's invasion was imminent, they summoned the landholders of Halogaland and the Trondheim district to join the royal army in resisting Tryggve. Svein Knutsson and his army, probably including elite Danish troops stood against them. Sveinn and his forces made their way south to Agder, believing that Tryggve would attempt to slip through the Skagerrak and join his supporters in Viken. Tryggve, however, landed instead in Hordaland, then sailed to Rogaland to attack Sveinn's navy. The two fleets met off the island of Bokn. Svein won the Battle of Soknasund and Tryggve Olavsson was killed. Later that same winter Kalv Arnesson and Einar Tambarskjelve met and decided to travel to Gardarike to fetch Olav Haraldsson's son Magnus. When Magnus came to Norway the people sided with him and against the Danes. Svein had to flee home to Denmark where he died a short time later. Thus the King of Denmark had to give up his claim on Norway.Saga of Magnus the Good (Heimskringla, translated by Samuel Laing) As a character in Shakespeare In William Shakespeare's Macbeth, there is a character called \\"Sweno, the Norways' king\\" based on Svein.Snodgrass, Mary Ellen, Literary Treks: Characters on the Move, pp. 106-107. 2003. . \\"The playwright transposes in time a foray led by Sweyn Alfivason, son of Canute II of England and Denmark and Aelfgiva of Northhampton.\\" Svein is a back-story character in the first act of Macbeth, where Shakespeare calls him Sweno.

The war served as the continuation of the civil war of 1993‚Äì94 and involved militias representing three political candidates. The conflict ended following the intervention of the Angolan army, which reinstated former president Denis Sassou Nguesso to power. Background The Republic of the Congo (Congo‚ÄìBrazzaville) gained its independence from France in 1960, and soon entered a period of political turbulence. Following a three-day uprising, Congo fell under the influence of scientific socialism, establishing relations with the Eastern Bloc and becoming a single-party People's Republic. Two regime changes took place as the country faced a rise in ethnic tensions, with Denis Sassou Nguesso assuming presidency in 1979. In 1990 the country made its first steps towards a multiparty political system, eventually leading to the 1992 general elections. The elections concluded with UPADS candidate Pascal Lissouba winning the presidential race, MCDDI's Bernard Kolelas coming second, and PCT's Sassou Nguesso running third. Kolelas and Sassou Nguesso were dissatisfied with the outcome of the elections, and created an alliance against Lissouba. Tensions continued to rise as Kolelas, Lissouba and Sassou formed the Ninja, Cocoye, and Cobra militia respectively. The militia drew members from their leaders' ethnic and political backgrounds: the Mbochi supported Sassou, and the Nibolek and the Lari sided with Lissouba and Kolelas respectively. Citing electoral fraud during the 1993 parliamentary elections, the Ninja and Cobra militia launched a civil war against the Cocoye. The conflict ended in December 1994, leaving 2,000 people dead and many more displaced. Despite remaining in power, Lissouba failed to fully implement the peace accords signed at the end of the war, as the country's militias retained their weapons. High unemployment rates, an atmosphere of political uncertainty, and the steady flow of firearms coming from regional conflicts contributed to the rise of the militia movement within the country. Violent disputes continued with each faction preparing for the upcoming 1997 elections. Conflict An Eland Mk7 armored car standing in front of the presidential palace as a memorial of the 5 June 1997 events. On 5 June 1997, anticipating a Sassou-led coup, Lissouba ordered the Cocoye militia to detain Sassou and forcibly disarm the Cobra militia, thus initiating a second civil war. Fighting soon engulfed the whole city, with the Cobra, Cocoye and Ninja militias each controlling areas within the capital. The government recruited Ukrainian mercenaries to fly attack helicopters, later mobilizing them in a bombing campaign of Cobra-controlled areas. Both sides actively shelled densely populated areas, causing a high civilian death toll. Combatants engaged in numerous instances of extortion and harassment of the civilian population, selecting their targets on the basis of ethnicity. On 16 June 1997 Lissouba and Sassou-Nguesso unsuccessfully held talks in Libreville, Gabon, organized with the mediation of the United Nations, the European Union, France and a number of African countries. On 17 June 1997 French soldiers and a number of US Marine Corps troops present in the capital conducted a joint operation, evacuating 6,000 foreign citizens through the Brazzaville Airport as warring parties agreed to a three-day ceasefire in the area. At the same time Lissouba personally visited Rwanda, Uganda and Namibia, attempting to gain the support of their leaders. He publicly accused the Cobra of employing supporters of former Zairian president Mobutu Sese Seko, prompting the president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Laurent Kabila, to send several hundred soldiers to Lissouba's aid. \\"On 29 September 1997 shells have fallen in several districts of Kinshasa left twenty-one dead. For forty- eight hours, the army of Kinshasa responded by firing at Brazzaville \\"more than a hundred shells\\", according to residents of the Congolese capital. They indicated that Kabila's artillery fired both on the North, under the control of General Sassou N'Guesso, and on the South, in the hands of supporters of President Lissouba. \\"They even bombarded the presidential palace\\" said a source, who confirmed that \\"this is where several shots came from on Monday.\\" \\" The outbreak of the Congolese civil war coincided with the ongoing internal conflict in Angola. During the presidency of Pascal Lissouba, Congo provided active support to the anti-government UNITA guerrillas, who in turn supplied Congo with diamonds. Angola seized the opportunity to destroy UNITA's last supply line by entering the conflict on Sassou-Nguesso's side. France also supported the Cobra militia by offering armaments, aiming to secure its interests in the country's oil industry. The conflict was also influenced by the aftermaths of the First Congo War and of the Rwandan genocide. A large number of Rwandan refugees who fled the DRC (formerly Zaire) in May 1997 after the fall of Mobutu, took part in the conflict‚Äîapproximately 600 Rwandans Hutus joined militias formed by Sassou, with others fighting against him. Allegations regarding the involvement of Cuba on the side of the Cobras have been made, with others accusing UNITA of aiding the Ninja militia. In September 1997, following Sassou's refusal to accept five ministerial portfolios, Lissouba granted Bernard Kolelas the position of Prime Minister, as the Ninja militia officially entered the conflict on the side of the government. Between 11‚Äì12 October 1997, Angolan air force fighter jets conducted a number of air strikes on Cocoye positions within Brazzaville. On 16 October 1997 Cobra militia supported by tanks and a force of 1,000 Angolan troops cemented their control of Brazzaville, having ousted Lissouba two days earlier. Denis Sassou Nguesso assumed power on the following day, declaring himself president. He effectively incorporated the Cobra militia into the national army, without fully disbanding them. After capturing the capital, Cobra militiamen spread out over the city, detaining and executing dozens of enemy combatants and political opponents and looting their property. A parallel Angolan offensive on Pointe-Noire met with little resistance, as the majority of government troops surrendered. Forced out of Brazzaville, Cocoye and Ninja fighters regrouped, initiating clashes in the northern cities of Impfondo, Ouesso and Owando as well as Pointe-Noire. In April 1998 Cocoye insurgents captured the Moukoukoulou Hydroelectric Dam located in the Bouenza department, killing several employees and cutting off the electric supply to Point-Noire for several weeks. On 29 August 1998 Ninja guerrillas killed the police commissioner of Mindouli. On 26 September 1998 Ninja rebels assassinated the deputy prefect of Goma Tse Tse. On 9 October 1998 Ninja rebels set fire to the police station and prefecture offices of Kinkala. The Ntsiloulou militia was formed in the Pool department in 1998, with the ethnic Lari forming the backbone of the group. It allied itself with the Ninja militia, launching attacks against government troops and their civilian supporters. The last quarter of 1998 marked an escalation in the conflict, as Ninja and Nsiloulou militia seized control of several areas in the south of the country. On 14 November 1998 Ninja militants launched an attack on Mindouli, killing 41 civilians, including six members of a local mediation committee. On 18 December 1998 Cocoye rebels captured the town of Nkayi, conducting summary executions of government officials and ethnic Mbochis; government forces regained control of the town three days later. Elements of the Chadian and Angolan armies were deployed to the areas of Bouenza, Niari and Lekoumou as well as the Pool department, aiming to counter increased rebel activity. On 16 December 1998 a band of 300 Ninja militants infiltrated the Bacongo and Makelekele neighborhoods of Brazzaville, starting clashes that lasted four days. The areas were targeted by heavy mortar and artillery shelling which caused widespread destruction, internally displacing 200,000 civilians. Widespread looting and summary executions were carried out by government forces following the conclusion of the engagement, which left at least 1000 people dead. On 29 December 1999, amidst continuous government offensives, a total of 2,000 Ninja and Cocoye rebels surrendered to the authorities after signing a peace agreement with the government, officially ending the conflict. Helicopter affair On 1 June 1997, in preparation for the upcoming war, President Lissouba approved the purchase of 28 South African Air Force A√©rospatiale SA 330 Puma helicopters. All transactions were conducted through a Johannesburg-based businessman, with funds being sent to the offshore accounts of three other South African businessmen. The offshore accounts were managed by the BVI-based Exotek Management Services, which in turn acted as a middleman of Armscor, the owner of the equipment. Several weeks after the start of the war Lissouba ordered two Mil Mi-17 helicopters, four transport aircraft and 290 trucks, while initiating payments through a Paris bank account. On 27 June 1997 a $1-million payment was received by Lissouba's South African partner, who in turn delivered two Mil Mi-17 helicopters to Lissoba's troops. On 11 July 1997 the Congolese government paid a total of $7.7 million for the 28 helicopters. In October 1997, having ousted Lissouba and assumed power, Sassou-Nguesso sent invoices to Exotek stating that all contracts and payments remained in force. However, the 28 Puma helicopters remained undelivered, as Exotek and Armscor blamed each other for the failure. In 2002 the Congolese government sued Armscor in a South African court, demanding the repayment of $7.7 million; the case was later settled out of court.

The club was founded on 29 June 1895 as Concordia Berlin and was one of the founding members of the German Football Association in Leipzig in 1900. It is named after Concordia, the Roman goddess of unity.  History  In its early years the club moved between first and second division level play on the local city circuit and captured its first honors with a second division title in 1901. That advanced the club to the Oberliga Berlin where they played a single season before becoming part of the Berliner Meisterschaft, a competing first tier circuit. They returned to Oberliga play in 1911. The team twice appeared in Berliner-Pokal (Berlin Cup) play, being put out by Wei√üenseer FC in a 1910 semifinal match, and in 1929, being thrashed 11‚Äì0 by Hertha BSC in a quarterfinal contest.Gr√ºne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag Concordia fell to amateur level play at the end of the 1911‚Äì12 campaign. They merged with an unnamed local side in 1924 to become Ballspiel-Club Concordia vom Jahre 1895.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Enzyklop√§die des deutschen Ligafu√üballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. . The team remained a lower-tier side until after World War II in 1945. In the aftermath of the war Allied occupation authorities banned all existing organizations in Germany, including sports and football clubs. Concordia was re-established as SG Wilhelmsruh and resumed play in the Amateurliga Berlin (II) in the 1947‚Äì48 season. The next year the club was renamed FC Concordia Wilhelmsruh and played two more seasons in the Amateurliga as a mid-table side. The burgeoning Cold War that would divide the country into East and West Germany led to the formation of separate football leagues in the Soviet-occupied areas. Being based in what would become East Berlin, Concordia was ousted from the Amateurliga Berlin to play in the DDR-Liga (II) as SG Concordia Wilhelmsruh. They were immediately relegated to the Landesliga Berlin (III) after only a single season and a last place finish. The club then played third tier football until the mid-1950s when it slipped deeper into the amateur ranks, making only occasional and fleeting appearances in the Bezirksliga Berlin through the 1970s and 1980s. The club collapsed after German reunification and was re-established in May 1992. Today the team fields a total of eighteen teams and emphasizes its youth sides. The men's team (I) played in the Bezirksliga Berlin (VIII) until 2015 when a league championship took it up to the Landesliga. It came last in its Landesliga division in 2015‚Äì16 and was relegated once more. Concordia was relegated even lower next season to the Kreisliga (IX).

Enckell followed his father's steps in Russian military and rose to the Imperial Russian Guard. As he was not satisfied in the earnings, he studied mechanical engineering degree in Germany. Subsequently, he worked in Kuusankoski paper mill and in Helsinki- based engineering companies Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works and Kone- ja Siltarakennus. During the 1910s Enckell worked in employers' organisations. In 1917, shortly before October Revolution, Enckell was appointed Finnish Minister‚ÄìSecretary of State in Saint Petersburg. Following the Finnish Declaration of Independence, Enckell worked hard to get international recognition for the declaration. During the following years, Enckell worked as diplomat in Paris and later in League of Nations, in which he successfully pursued the Finnish interests in √Öland crisis. He served as foreign minister in four short-lived cabinets during the early politically turbulent years of the young republic. Enckell moved to work in financial sector in the 1920s but made return into politics as Foreign Minister. He led Finland out from Second World War and contributed establishing friendly relations with Soviet Union and new foreign policy, the Paasikivi‚ÄìKekkonen doctrine. Enckell was married to German-born Lucy n√©e Ponsonby-Lyons. They had four children, of whom Ralph Enckell became a notable diplomat.  Early years and military studies  Carl Enckell was born and spent his first seven years in Saint Petersburg. His father, Carl Enckell Sr., served as military officer until he returned in Grand Duchy of Finland after serving for 30 years in the Imperial Russian Army. As a son of a military family, Enckell went to study in Hamina Cadet School which was managed by his father. He graduated in 1896 as ensign and best of his class. Enckell was positioned in Izmaylovsky Regiment, Imperial Russian Guard.  Engineering studies and business career  Salaries in the military had stayed behind the business and industry, and in 1899 Enckell started engineering studies in Dresden University of Technology, Germany. After three years of studies he graduated as Mechanical Engineer and returned to Finland with his German wife Lucy n√©e Ponsonby-Lyons. During 1903‚Äì1905 Enckell worked in Kuusankoski paper mill as supervisor and chief engineer. In 1905 he went to work for Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works, where he stayed until he got a deputy director position in Kone- ja Siltarakennus in 1907. In 1911 he was appointed company manager. Enckell aimed to keep production in balance in the turbulent market ‚Äì the Finnish engineering industry faced both up- and downswings. Enckell could gather beneficial orders for military supplies during Russo-Japanese War and the following armaments race prior to First World War.  Employers' organisations  During the 1910s Enckell operated in employers' organisations; during 1912‚Äì1919 he was deputy director of Finnish General Employers' Federation and Finnish Engineering Industry Employers' Federation. He took part in economical and political negotiations between Grand Duchy of Finland and Russian Empire in 1913‚Äì1915; he represented the Finnish industry and resisted the suggested Russian uniform tariff policy which would have weakened the competitiveness of Finnish companies against Russian ones.  Beginning of political career  Enckell became involved in local politics during 1911‚Äì1914 in Helsinki City Council. In 1917 he was appointed the Finnish Minister‚ÄìSecretary of State in Saint Petersburg. Following the Bolshevik Revolution, the Finnish senate declared itself the highest authority in Finland. As a representative of the Senate, Enckell worked hard to persuade foreign governments and the Bolshevik leadership to support the Finnish pursuit of independence. On 6 December 1917 the senate declared Finland a sovereign country. A Finnish delegation, which comprised Enckell, Gustaf Idman and the Finnish regent Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, visited the Bolshevik government. Secretary General of the Council of People's Commissars Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich announced to the Finnish delegation that the Council recognised the Finnish independence; the confirmation by the central committee followed four days later. After this followed the recognitions of France, Germany and the Scandinavian countries. Enckell was one of the few Finnish politicians who had experience about foreign relations; during the first years of independence he was Minister of Foreign affairs in Lauri Ingman's cabinet 1918‚Äì1919 after which he was appointed Finnish Representative in Paris. In the peace negotiations that followed the First World War, Finland took distance from Germany to get recognition for its independence from the Allies. Finland also sought for support in √Öland crisis that had emerged with Sweden, which demanded the group of islands to itself. Enckell led the Finnish delegation in peace negotiations in Paris in 1919. League of Nations processed the position of √Öland in 1920‚Äì1921; Enckell procrastinated the case to a more favourable point, when the ethnic minorities' demands for self-determination were not topical any more. In 1921 League of Nations resolved the dispute in favour of Finland, largely due to Enckell's diplomatic endeavour. After managing complicated political questions successfully in Saint Petersburg, Paris and League of Nations, Enckell became reputable for his excellent diplomatic skills. Enckell returned as Foreign Minister in two short-living cabinets led by Aimo Cajander in 1922 and 1924.  Career in financial sector  Enckell left politics and changed to banking in 1927, when he became deputy director of Liittopankki. After merger with Helsingin Osakepankki (HOP) in 1931, he became board member. In 1936 he became manager of Industrialists' Mutual Fire Insurance Company. Enckell took part again in activities in employers' organisations and worked in positions of trust in number of Finnish companies.  Back to politics  Enckell returned to politics in September 1944 when he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in Antti Hackzell's cabinet. He was sent to peace negotiations to Moscow to replace the head of the Finnish delegation, prime minister Hackzell, who had fallen seriously ill. As an outcome, Finland signed the Moscow Armistice which ended the Continuation War between Finland and Soviet Union. Enckell took part in the Paris peace conference in August and September 1946 as deputy chairman of the Finnish delegation and on 10 February 1947 he signed the Paris peace treaty as chairman of the delegation. Enckell left his post as insurance company director in 1946 and devoted again to foreign affairs. After the Second World War, we took part in structuring a new pragmatic role for Finland in the global politics. The policy, later known as Paasikivi‚ÄìKekkonen doctrine, was based on the geopolitic fact that Finland was a neighbour of a superpower and did not have powerful allies. In 1948 Enckell took part in negotiations with Soviet Union, after which the countries signed Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance, that became cornerstone of the Finnish foreign politics for decades. Enckell retired in 1950, after serving as Foreign Minister for six consecutive years. During his career he served total 2,502 days as a minister.  Personal life  In 1903 Enckell was married to German-born Lucy Marie Frieda Agathe Margareta Ponsonby-Lyons (1875‚Äì1945). The couple had two daughters and two sons who were born between 1911‚Äì1920. The younger son, Ralph Enckell, became a notable diplomat. Enckell bought Eriksn√§s Mansion in Sipoo in 1916 and used it as his summer residence. During his diplomacy years in Paris he started collecting historical maps of Northern Europe and Russia; the collection is currently kept in Helsinki University Library.

He played football at various times with his local clubs Eadestown in Kildare and Castlehaven in Cork. He also played football with both the Kildare and Cork senior inter-county teams throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Tompkins captained Cork to the All-Ireland title in 1990 and later served as manager of the team from 1996 until 2003. Early life Larry Tompkins was born in Greenmount, Rathmore just outside Naas, County Kildare in 1963. The youngest of seven children, he showed a keen interest in Gaelic football from an early age. Tompkins was educated at Rathmore national school where he first played both hurling and football. He later attended Blessington secondary school in County Wicklow where he developed his football skills even further. Tompkins was captain of the Wicklow Vocational Schools team that won the Leinster championship in 1980. The team subsequently lost the All-Ireland final to Derry. Tomkins later trained as a carpenter; however, at a time when unemployment was rife in Ireland, he spent much of the early 1980s working in the United States. Tompkins returned to Ireland in 1987 and settled in Castlehaven, County Cork. Club career Tomkins began his club football career with his local club in Eadestown and enjoyed much success. He won a junior 'B‚Äô title with the club in 1981, a victory which acted as a springboard for further success. The following year Tompkins added a junior 'A‚Äô title to his collection. Further success followed in 1983 when Eadestown, with Tompkins playing a key role, secured a county intermediate championship title. When Tompkins emigrated to the United States in the 1980s he played his club football with the Donegal club in New York. He enjoyed much success here and he captained the club to win the New York championship on two occasions. Famously, the club never lost a championship game when Tompkins was included on the team. It was in New York that Tompkins befriended the Collins's from Castlehaven, County Cork. They persuaded him to join their local club when he returned to Ireland. In 1987 Tomkins did just that and threw his lot in with 'the 'Haven'. Two years later his decision bore fruit. Tompkins was captain as Castlehaven defeated the famous St. Finbarr's club to take the county senior championship title in Cork. Castlehaven later defeated St. Senan's of Clare to take the Munster club title. Castlehaven's great run of success came to an abrupt end in the All- Ireland semi-final when the club was defeated by eventual champions Baltinglass. Five years later in 1994 Tompkins secured a second county championship winners' medal following a victory over nearby rivals O'Donovan Rossa. A second Munster club winners' medal later followed for Tompkins as Castlehaven defeated Clomnel Commercials of Tipperary. Once again, 'the 'Haven' were later defeated by Kilmacud Crokes in the All-Ireland semi- final.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 208 1997 saw Castlehaven lose the county final to Beara, however, the club later represented Cork in the provincial series of games. A third Munster club title soon followed after a defeat of Fethard in the provincial decider. Castlehaven faced heartbreak again following a third defeat in the All-Ireland semi-final.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 209 County career Minor and under-21 Tomkins first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a sixteen-year- old in 1979. That year he was a member of the Kildare minor, under-21 and senior football teams. Tompkins spent three seasons with Kildare at minor level. He lined out against Meath in the Leinster final in 1980, however, on that occasion 'the Lilywhites' were defeated on that occasion by 1‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì9.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 154 That same year Tompkins lined out in the Leinster under-21 final with Dublin providing the opposition. An exciting game developed with both sides finishing level. A replay proved more conclusive with 'the Dubs' taking the title by 2‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì6.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 162 Three years later in 1983 Tompkins played in a second Leinster under-21 final. Louth provided the opposition on that occasion; however, victory went to Kildare by 1‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì8. It was Tompkins's first Leinster under-21 winners' medal.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 162 Kildare, however, were subsequently defeated in the All-Ireland semi- final. Senior By this stage Tompkins was a well-established player on the Kildare senior football team. It was an unhappy time for 'the Lilywhites' as they failed to even reach the Leinster final. An O'Byrne Cup title in 1982 was the best that the county could muster.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 217 By the mid-1980s Tompkins was recognised as Kildare's top player, however, it wasn't long before he had a disagreement with the Kildare county board. He had been living in New York but returned regularly to line out with Kildare. The county board had been paying for his flight tickets, however, they decided to stop this and Tomkins found the expense too great. As a result of this he never played with his native-county again and faced the prospect of prematurely ending a promising inter-county career. In 1987 Tompkins's performances for Castlehaven brought him to the attention of the Cork senior football selectors under legendary goalkeeper Billy Morgan. He earned a call up to the team and made his senior debut in the provincial championship that same year. The task ahead was enormous as Cork's nearest neighbours, Kerry, had won eleven of the last twelve Munster titles and had put Cork to the sword on most of those occasions. The 'traditional' Munster final in 1987 between Cork and Kerry ended in a draw, however, Cork triumphed over the four-in-a-row hopefuls by 0‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì5.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 141 It was Tompkins's first Munster winners' medal. Cork subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland final with Meath providing the opposition. Mid-way through the first-half Cork had a goal chance blocked by Mick Lyons when Jimmy Kerrigan looked to be through for a seven-point lead. Instead, it was Meath who led by 1‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì8 at half-time, courtesy of a Colm O'Rourke goal. Tompkins's radar was also off course as he missed six out of eight free-kicks. At the full-time whistle Meath were the winners by 1‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì11. In spite of the defeat Tompkins rounded off the year by winning an All-Star award. In 1988 Tompkins captured a second consecutive Munster title before a second All-Ireland final appearance beckoned. Meath provided the opposition once again as Cork got off to a good start with a Teddy McCarthy goal. By the end of the game Cork led by a point, however, Brian Stafford scored the equaliser. The replay was a controversial affair. Meath's Gerry McEntee was sent-off after just seven minutes. In spite of being reduced to fourteen men, Meath hung on for a narrow 0‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì12 victory.The GAA Book of Lists p. 407 It was Tompkins's second consecutive defeat, however, he was later presented with a second All-Star. A National League title was captured at the start of 1989 and a third consecutive Munster title was annexed by Tompkins later that summer. Once again, Cork qualified for a third consecutive All-Ireland final. Mayo were the opponents on this occasion and the game was a close affair for much of the opening half. An Anthony Finnerty goal after thirty-eight minutes gave Mayo a brief lead, however, the Connacht champs failed to score for the last nineteen minutes. Teddy McCarthy took control and Cork secured victory by 0‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì11.The GAA Book of Lists pp. 407‚Äì408 It was Tompkins's first All-Ireland winners' medal and a first title for Cork since 1973. A third consecutive All- Star award quickly followed. In 1990 Tomkins was appointed Cork captain as the team sought to retain their All-Ireland title. That year Cork made it a remarkable four Munster titles on the trot. A fourth consecutive All-Ireland final appearance quickly followed, with old rivals Meath providing the opposition. Cork suffered a blow in the first-half when Colm O'Neill was sent off; however, Tomkins's fellow Kildare county man, Shay Fahy, was playing a blinder at midfield. In spite of only having fourteen men Cork won the game by 0‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì9.The GAA Book of Lists p. 408 It was a second consecutive All- Ireland title Tompkins, while he also had the honour of collecting the Sam Maguire Cup. This victory was all the more special as the Cork hurling team had already won their respective All-Ireland title a fortnight earlier. It was the first time in the modern era that a county had won the hurling and football 'double'. Cork lost their provincial titles for the next few seasons and a series of injuries nearly brought Tompkins's career to an end. He missed Cork's Munster final triumph and their All-Ireland final defeat in 1993, but returned to the team in 1994. That year he secured a fifth Munster winners' medal following a convincing victory over Tipperary. Cork, however, were later defeated by eventual champions Down in the All-Ireland semi-final.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 124 In 1995 Tompkins won a sixth Munster title, a record-breaking seventh in nine seasons for Cork, as Kerry fell in the provincial decider. Once again Cork were subsequently defeated by eventual All-Ireland champions Dublin in the All-Ireland semi-final.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 124 In 1996 the old order in Munster was restored. Kerry defeated Cork by 0‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì11 in the Munster final, taking their first provincial title since 1991 in the process. This defeat saw Cork exit the championship and effectively brought Tompkins's inter-county career to an end. Managerial career Tompkins became involved in coaching while he was still in his heyday as a player. He managed the Waterford under-21 football team in the early 1990s. Although he didn't enjoy any success with the team, it was Tompkins's coaching that helped the county to contest three consecutive Munster under-21 finals between 1993 and 1995.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 162 In late 1996 Tompkins succeeded Billy Morgan as manager of the Cork senior football team. It was a tough act to follow as Morgan had been Cork's most successful manager of all-time. The first two seasons proved difficult as Cork crashed out of the championship at very early stages. The county board had faith in Tompkins who was attempting to put together a new team following the retirements of some of the great players from the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1999 Cork were back in the big time. Tompkins began the year by guiding Cork to a National League title following a 0‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì7 victory over Dublin.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 178 Shortly after this victory he steered his adopted county to a Munster football decider against arch-rivals Kerry. In atrocious weather conditions Cork emerged victorious by 2‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì4. It was Tompkin's first Munster title as manager and acted as a springboard for further success. In September his charges lined out in the All-Ireland final against Meath. In an exciting game that saw the lead switch hands on several occasions Cork's hopes of doing the double were dashed as Meath won by 1‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì8.The GAA Book of Lists p. 410 Cork lost their provincial crown for the next few seasons; however, in 2002 Tompkins's side tasted success once again. Tipperary surprisingly provided the opposition in the provincial final, however, the game ended in a draw. After a thrilling draw Cork trounced Tipp by 1‚Äì23 to 0‚Äì7 in the subsequent replay. It was the Kildare man's second Munster title as manager. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final pitted Cork against Kerry. It was an historic occasion as it was the first time that these great rivals had met in Croke Park. Unfortunately, Cork were trounced on a score line of 3‚Äì19 to 2‚Äì7. The year ended with the Cork hurling team going on strike. In turn, the football team joined in a sympathy strike. The players, who had been seeking better conditions, refused to play or train with the county again until the dispute with the county board was resolved. Following the strike the fortunes of the Cork football team took a turn for the worse. Embarrassing defeats in 2003 brought Tompkins's reign as manager to an end. Personal life Tompkins owns and runs his own pub in the centre of Cork city. Honours In May 2020, the Irish Independent named Tompkins at number eight in its \\"Top 20 footballers in Ireland over the past 50 years\\".

BMAA is a neurotoxin and its potential role in various neurodegenerative disorders is the subject of scientific research.  Structure and properties  BMAA is a derivative of the amino acid alanine with a methylamino group on the side chain. This non-proteinogenic amino acid is classified as a polar base.  Sources and detection  BMAA is produced by cyanobacteria in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. In cultured non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, BMAA production increases in a nitrogen- depleted medium. BMAA has been found in aquatic organisms and in plants with cyanobacterial symbionts such as certain lichens, the floating fern Azolla, the leaf petioles of the tropical flowering plant Gunnera, cycads as well as in animals that eat the fleshy covering of cycad seeds, including flying foxes. High concentrations of BMAA are present in shark fins. Because BMAA is a neurotoxin, consumption of shark fin soup and cartilage pills therefore may pose a health risk. The toxin can be detected via several laboratory methods, including liquid chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, amino acid analyzer, capillary electrophoresis, and NMR spectroscopy. Neurotoxicity BMAA can cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier in rats. It takes longer to get into the brain than into other organs, but once there, it is trapped in proteins, forming a reservoir for slow release over time.Mash D, et al. Neurotoxic non-protein amino acid BMAA in brain from patients dying with ALS and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease poster presented at: American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting, Chicago, IL, 17 April 2008 Neurology 2008;70(suppl 1):A329.Xie X, et al. Tracking brain uptake and protein incorporation of cyanobacterial toxin BMAA abstract presented at: 22nd Annual Symposium on ALS/MND, Sydney, Australia, 1 December 2011.  Mechanisms  Although the mechanisms by which BMAA causes motor neuron dysfunction and death are not entirely understood, current research suggests that there are multiple mechanisms of action. Acutely, BMAA can act as an excitotoxin on glutamate receptors, such as NMDA, calcium-dependent AMPA, and kainate receptors. The activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 is believed to induce oxidative stress in the neuron by depletion of glutathione. BMAA can be misincorporated into nascent proteins in place of -serine, possibly causing protein misfolding and aggregation, both hallmarks of tangle diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and Lewy body disease. In vitro research has shown that protein association of BMAA may be inhibited in the presence of excess -serine.  Effects  A study performed in 2015 with vervets (Chlorocebus sabaeus) in St. Kitts, which are homozygous for the apoE4 gene (a condition which in humans is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease), found that vervets that were administered BMAA orally, developed hallmark histopathology features of Alzheimer's Disease including amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangle accumulation. Vervets in the trial fed smaller doses of BMAA were found to have correlative decreases in these pathology features. Additionally, vervets that were co-administered BMAA with serine were found to have 70% less beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles than those administered BMAA alone, suggesting that serine may be protective against the neurotoxic effects of BMAA. This experiment represents the first in-vivo model of Alzheimer's Disease that features both beta-amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau protein. This study also demonstrates that BMAA, an environmental toxin, can trigger neurodegenerative disease as a result of a gene-environment interaction. Degenerative locomotor diseases have been described in animals grazing on cycad species, fueling interest in a possible link between the plant and the etiology of ALS/PDC. Subsequent laboratory investigations discovered the presence of BMAA. BMAA induced severe neurotoxicity in rhesus macaques, including. *limb muscle atrophy *nonreactive degeneration of anterior horn cells *degeneration and partial loss of pyramidal neurons of the motor cortex *behavioral dysfunction *conduction deficits in the central motor pathway *neuropathological changes of motor cortex Betz cells There are reports that low BMAA concentrations can selectively kill cultured motor neurons from mouse spinal cords and produce reactive oxygen species. Scientists have also found that newborn rats treated with BMAA show a progressive neurodegeneration in the hippocampus, including intracellular fibrillar inclusions, and impaired learning and memory as adults.Karlsson, O. (2011). Distribution and Long-term Effects of the Environmental Neurotoxin Œ≤-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA): Brain changes and behavioral impairments following developmental exposure. http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-140785 In addition BMAA has been reported to be excreted into rodent breast milk, and subsequently transferred to the suckling offspring, suggesting mothers and cows milk might be other possible exposure routes.  Human cases  Chronic dietary exposure to BMAA is now considered to be a cause of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism‚Äìdementia complex (ALS/PDC) that had an extremely high rate of incidence among the Chamorro people of Guam. The Chamorro call the condition lytico-bodig. In the 1950s, ALS/PDC prevalence ratios and death rates for Chamorro residents of Guam and Rota were 50-100 times that of developed countries, including the United States. No demonstrable heritable or viral factors were found for the disease, and a subsequent decline of ALS/PDC after 1963 on Guam led to the search for responsible environmental agents. The use of flour made from cycad seed (Cycas micronesica) in traditional food items decreased as that plant became rarer and the Chamorro population became more Americanized following World War II. Cycads harbor symbiotic cyanobacteria of the genus Nostoc in specialized roots which push up through the leaf litter into the light; these cyanobacteria produce BMAA. In addition to eating traditional food items from cycad flour directly, BMAA may be ingested by humans through biomagnification. Flying foxes, a Chamorro delicacy, forage on the fleshy seed covering of cycad seeds and concentrate the toxin in their bodies. Twenty-four specimens of flying foxes from museum collections were tested for BMAA, which was found in large concentrations in the flying foxes from Guam. Currently there are studies examining BMAA biomagnification in marine and estuarine systems and its possible impact on human health outside of Guam. Studies on human brain tissue of ALS/PDC, ALS, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and neurological controls indicated that BMAA is present in non-genetic progressive neurodegenerative disease, but not in controls or genetic-based Huntington's disease. Currently, there is ongoing research into the role of BMAA as an environmental factor in neurodegenerative disease. Clinical trials Safe and effective ways of treating ALS patients with -serine, which has been found to protect non-human primates from BMAA-induced neurodegeneration, have been goals of clinical trials conducted by the Phoenix Neurological Associates and the Forbes/Norris ALS/MND clinic and sponsored by the Institute for Ethnomedicine.Determining the Safety of L-serine in ALS.Safety Study of High Doses of Zinc in ALS Patients (completed).

Topography Meal fell reaches a height of 550 m (1,804 ft) and although it is largely grassy and smooth like the other Uldale Fells it does have a stony summit with patches of scree.

Examples of that car bumpers are made lighter, clothing is more stain repellant, sunscreen is more radiation resistant, synthetic bones are stronger, cell phone screens are lighter weight, glass packaging for drinks leads to a longer shelf-life, and balls for various sports are made more durable. Using nanotech, in the mid- term modern textiles will become \\"smart\\", through embedded \\"wearable electronics\\", such novel products have also a promising potential especially in the field of cosmetics, and has numerous potential applications in heavy industry. Nanotechnology is predicted to be a main driver of technology and business in this century and holds the promise of higher performance materials, intelligent systems and new production methods with significant impact for all aspects of society.  Foods  A complex set of engineering and scientific challenges in the food and bioprocessing industry for manufacturing high quality and safe food through efficient and sustainable means can be solved through nanotechnology. Bacteria identification and food quality monitoring using biosensors; intelligent, active, and smart food packaging systems; nanoencapsulation of bioactive food compounds are few examples of emerging applications of nanotechnology for the food industry.Suresh Neethirajan, Digvir Jayas. 2009. Nanotechnology for food and bioprocessing industries. 5th CIGR International Technical Symposium on Food Processing, Monitoring Technology in Bioprocesses and Food Quality Management, Potsdam, Germany. 8 p. Nanotechnology can be applied in the production, processing, safety and packaging of food. A nanocomposite coating process could improve food packaging by placing anti-microbial agents directly on the surface of the coated film. Nanocomposites could increase or decrease gas permeability of different fillers as is needed for different products. They can also improve the mechanical and heat-resistance properties and lower the oxygen transmission rate. Research is being performed to apply nanotechnology to the detection of chemical and biological substances for sensanges in foods. In general, food substances are not allowed to be adulterated, according to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (section 402).Federal Food, Drug an Cosmetic Act Retrieved 08/22/2012 Additives to food must conform to all regulations in the food additives amendment of 1958 as well as the FDA Modernization Act of 1997. In addition, color additives are obliged to comply with all regulations stipulated by the Color Additive Amendments of 1960. A safety assessment must be performed on all food substances for submission and approval by the US FDA. The mandatory information in this assessment includes the identity, technical effects, self-limiting levels of use, dietary exposure and safety studies for the manufacturing processes used, including the use of nanotechnology. Food manufacturers are obliged to assess whether the identity, safety or regulatory status of a food substance is affected by significant changes in manufacturing processes, such as the use of nanotechnology. In their guidance document published in April 2012, the US FDA discusses what considerations and recommendations may apply to such an assessment. Nano-foods New foods are among the nanotechnology-created consumer products coming onto the market at the rate of 3 to 4 per week, according to the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies (PEN), based on an inventory it has drawn up of 609 known or claimed nano-products. On PEN's list are three foods‚Äîa brand of canola cooking oil called Canola Active Oil, a tea called Nanotea and a chocolate diet shake called Nanoceuticals Slim Shake Chocolate. According to company information posted on PEN's Web site, the canola oil, by Shemen Industries of Israel, contains an additive called \\"nanodrops\\" designed to carry vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals through the digestive system and urea.Canola Active Oil The shake, according to U.S. manufacturer RBC Life Sciences Inc., uses cocoa infused \\"NanoClusters\\" to enhance the taste and health benefits of cocoa without the need for extra sugar.Nano-foods: The Next Consumer Scare? Consumer goods  Surfaces and coatings  The most prominent application of nanotechnology in the household is self-cleaning or \\"easy-to- clean\\" surfaces on ceramics or glasses. Nanoceramic particles have improved the smoothness and heat resistance of common household equipment such as the flat iron. The first sunglasses using protective and anti-reflective ultrathin polymer coatings are on the market. For optics, nanotechnology also offers scratch resistant surface coatings based on nanocomposites. Nano-optics could allow for an increase in precision of pupil repair and other types of laser eye surgery.  Textiles  The use of engineered nanofibers already makes clothes water- and stain-repellent or wrinkle-free. Textiles with a nanotechnological finish can be washed less frequently and at lower temperatures. Nanotechnology has been used to integrate tiny carbon particles membrane and guarantee full-surface protection from electrostatic charges for the wearer. Many other applications have been developed by research institutions such as the Textiles Nanotechnology Laboratory at Cornell University, and the UK's Dstl and its spin out company P2i.  Cosmetics  One field of application is in sunscreens. The traditional chemical UV protection approach suffers from its poor long-term stability. A sunscreen based on mineral nanoparticles such as titanium oxide offer several advantages. Titanium oxide nanoparticles have a comparable UV protection property as the bulk material, but lose the cosmetically undesirable whitening as the particle size is decreased.  Sports  Nanotechnology may also play a role in sports such as soccer, football, and baseball. Materials for new athletic shoes may be made in order to make the shoe lighter (and the athlete faster). Baseball bats already on the market are made with carbon nanotubes that reinforce the resin, which is said to improve its performance by making it lighter. Other items such as sport towels, yoga mats, exercise mats are on the market and used by players in the National Football League, which use antimicrobial nanotechnology to prevent parasuram from illnesses caused by bacteria such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (commonly known as MRSA).  Aerospace and vehicle manufacturers Lighter and stronger materials will be of immense use to aircraft manufacturers, leading to increased performance. Spacecraft will also benefit, where weight is a major factor. Nanotechnology might thus help to reduce the size of equipment and thereby decrease fuel-consumption required to get it airborne. Hang gliders may be able to halve their weight while increasing their strength and toughness through the use of nanotech materials. Nanotech is lowering the mass of supercapacitors that will increasingly be used to give power to assistive electrical motors for launching hang gliders off flatland to thermal-chasing altitudes. Much like aerospace, lighter and stronger materials would be useful for creating vehicles that are both faster and safer. Combustion engines might also benefit from parts that are more hard-wearing and more heat-resistant.  Military  Biological sensors Nanotechnology can improve the military‚Äôs ability to detect biological agents. By using nanotechnology, the military would be able to create sensor systems that could detect biological agents. The sensor systems are already well developed and will be one of the first forms of nanotechnology that the military will start to use. Uniform material Nanoparticles can be injected into the material on soldiers‚Äô uniforms to not only make the material more durable, but also to protect soldiers from many different dangers such as high temperatures, impacts and chemicals. The nanoparticles in the material protect soldiers from these dangers by grouping together when something strikes the armor and stiffening the area of impact. This stiffness helps lessen the impact of whatever hit the armor, whether it was extreme heat or a blunt force. By reducing the force of the impact, the nanoparticles protect the soldier wearing the uniform from any injury the impact could have caused. Another way nanotechnology can improve soldiers‚Äô uniforms is by creating a better form of camouflage. Mobile pigment nanoparticles injected into the material can produce a better form of camouflage. These mobile pigment particles would be able to change the color of the uniforms depending upon the area that the soldiers are in. There is still much research being done on this self-changing camouflage. Nanotechnology can improve thermal camouflage. Thermal camouflage helps protect soldiers from people who are using night vision technology. Surfaces of many different military items can be designed in a way that electromagnetic radiation can help lower the infrared signatures of the object that the surface is on. Surfaces of soldiers‚Äô uniforms and surfaces of military vehicle are a few surfaces that can be designed in this way. By lowering the infrared signature of both the soldiers and the military vehicles the soldiers are using, it will provide better protection from infrared guided weapons or infrared surveillance sensors. Communication method There is a way to use nanoparticles to create coated polymer threads that can be woven into soldiers‚Äô uniforms. These polymer threads could be used as a form of communication between the soldiers. The system of threads in the uniforms could be set to different light wavelengths, eliminating the ability for anyone else to listen in. This would lower the risk of having anything intercepted by unwanted listeners. Medical system A medical surveillance system for soldiers to wear can be made using nanotechnology. This system would be able to watch over their health and stress levels. The systems would be able to react to medical situations by releasing drugs or compressing wounds as necessary. This means that if the system detected an injury that was bleeding, it would be able to compress around the wound until further medical treatment could be received. The system would also be able to release drugs into the soldier‚Äôs body for health reasons, such as pain killers for an injury. The system would be able to inform the medics at base of the soldier‚Äôs health status at all times that the soldier is wearing the system. The energy needed to communicate this information back to base would be produced through the soldier‚Äôs body movements. Weapons Nanoweapon is the name given to military technology currently under development which seeks to exploit the power of nanotechnology in the modern battlefield.In the new nanoweapons era, the United States and Britain are Third World countriesAn Interview on Nanoweapons Nano Weapons Join the Fight Against CancerNumber Five: The Case for Nanoweapons Risks in military * People such as state agencies, criminals and enterprises could use nano-robots to eavesdrop on conversations held in private. * Grey goo: an uncontrollable, self-replicating nano-machine or robot. * Nanoparticles used in different military materials could potentially be a hazard to the soldiers that are wearing the material, if the material is allowed to get worn out. As the uniforms wear down it is possible for nanomaterial to break off and enter the soldiers‚Äô bodies. Having nanoparticles entering the soldiers‚Äô bodies would be very unhealthy and could seriously harm them. There is not a lot of information on what the actual damage to the soldiers would be, but there have been studies on the effect of nanoparticles entering a fish through its skin. The studies showed that the different fish in the study suffered from varying degrees of brain damage. Although brain damage would be a serious negative effect, the studies also say that the results cannot be taken as an accurate example of what would happen to soldiers if nanoparticles entered their bodies. There are very strict regulations on the scientists that manufacture products with nanoparticles. With these strict regulations, they are able to largely decrease the danger of nanoparticles wearing off of materials and entering the soldiers‚Äô systems.  Catalysis  Chemical catalysis benefits especially from nanoparticles, due to the extremely large surface-to-volume ratio. The application potential of nanoparticles in catalysis ranges from fuel cell to catalytic converters and photocatalytic devices. Catalysis is also important for the production of chemicals. For example, nanoparticles with a distinct chemical surrounding (ligands), or specific optical properties. Platinum nanoparticles are being considered in the next generation of automotive catalytic converters because the very high surface area of nanoparticles could reduce the amount of platinum required.Press Release: American Elements Announces P-Mite Line of Platinum Nanoparticles for Catalyst Applications American Elements, October 3, 2007 However, some concerns have been raised due to experiments demonstrating that they will spontaneously combust if methane is mixed with the ambient air.Platinum nanoparticles bring spontaneous ignition , April 25, 2005 Ongoing research at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in France may resolve their true usefulness for catalytic applications.Electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol Nanofiltration may come to be an important application, although future research must be careful to investigate possible toxicity.Hillie, Thembela and Mbhuti Hlophe. \\"Nanotechnology and the challenge of clean water.\\" Nature.com/naturenanotechonolgy. November 2007: Volume 2.  Construction  Nanotechnology has the potential to make construction faster, cheaper, safer, and more varied. Automation of nanotechnology construction can allow for the creation of structures from advanced homes to massive skyscrapers much more quickly and at much lower cost. In the near future, Nanotechnology can be used to sense cracks in foundations of architecture and can send nanobots to repair them. Nanotechnology is an active research area that encompasses a number of disciplines such as electronics, bio-mechanics and coatings. These disciplines assist in the areas of civil engineering and construction materials. If nanotechnology is implemented in the construction of homes and infrastructure, such structures will be stronger. If buildings are stronger, then fewer of them will require reconstruction and less waste will be produced. Nanotechnology in construction involves using nanoparticles such as alumina and silica. Manufacturers are also investigating the methods of producing nano-cement. If cement with nano-size particles can be manufactured and processed, it will open up a large number of opportunities in the fields of ceramics, high strength composites and electronic applications. Nanomaterials still have a high cost relative to conventional materials, meaning that they are not likely to feature in high-volume building materials. The day when this technology slashes the consumption of structural steel has not yet been contemplated. Cement Much analysis of concrete is being done at the nano-level in order to understand its structure. Such analysis uses various techniques developed for study at that scale such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Focused Ion Beam (FIB). This has come about as a side benefit of the development of these instruments to study the nanoscale in general, but the understanding of the structure and behavior of concrete at the fundamental level is an important and very appropriate use of nanotechnology. One of the fundamental aspects of nanotechnology is its interdisciplinary nature and there has already been cross over research between the mechanical modeling of bones for medical engineering to that of concrete which has enabled the study of chloride diffusion in concrete (which causes corrosion of reinforcement). Concrete is, after all, a macro-material strongly influenced by its nano-properties and understanding it at this new level is yielding new avenues for improvement of strength, durability and monitoring as outlined in the following paragraphs Silica (SiO2) is present in conventional concrete as part of the normal mix. However, one of the advancements made by the study of concrete at the nanoscale is that particle packing in concrete can be improved by using nano- silica which leads to a densifying of the micro and nanostructure resulting in improved mechanical properties. Nano-silica addition to cement based materials can also control the degradation of the fundamental C-S-H (calcium- silicatehydrate) reaction of concrete caused by calcium leaching in water as well as block water penetration and therefore lead to improvements in durability. Related to improved particle packing, high energy milling of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) clinker and standard sand, produces a greater particle size diminution with respect to conventional OPC and, as a result, the compressive strength of the refined material is also 3 to 6 times higher (at different ages). Steel Steel is a widely available material that has a major role in the construction industry. The use of nanotechnology in steel helps to improve the physical properties of steel. Fatigue, or the structural failure of steel, is due to cyclic loading. Current steel designs are based on the reduction in the allowable stress, service life or regular inspection regime. This has a significant impact on the life-cycle costs of structures and limits the effective use of resources. Stress risers are responsible for initiating cracks from which fatigue failure results. The addition of copper nanoparticles reduces the surface un-evenness of steel, which then limits the number of stress risers and hence fatigue cracking. Advancements in this technology through the use of nanoparticles would lead to increased safety, less need for regular inspection, and more efficient materials free from fatigue issues for construction. Steel cables can be strengthened using carbon nanotubes. Stronger cables reduce the costs and period of construction, especially in suspension bridges, as the cables are run from end to end of the span. The use of vanadium and molybdenum nanoparticles improves the delayed fracture problems associated with high strength bolts. This reduces the effects of hydrogen embrittlement and improves steel micro-structure by reducing the effects of the inter-granular cementite phase. Welds and the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) adjacent to welds can be brittle and fail without warning when subjected to sudden dynamic loading. The addition of nanoparticles such as magnesium and calcium makes the HAZ grains finer in plate steel. This nanoparticle addition leads to an increase in weld strength. The increase in strength results in a smaller resource requirement because less material is required in order to keep stresses within allowable limits. Wood Nanotechnology represents a major opportunity for the wood industry to develop new products, substantially reduce processing costs, and open new markets for biobased materials. Wood is also composed of nanotubes or ‚Äúnanofibrils‚Äù; namely, lignocellulosic (woody tissue) elements which are twice as strong as steel. Harvesting these nanofibrils would lead to a new paradigm in sustainable construction as both the production and use would be part of a renewable cycle. Some developers have speculated that building functionality onto lignocellulosic surfaces at the nanoscale could open new opportunities for such things as self-sterilizing surfaces, internal self-repair, and electronic lignocellulosic devices. These non-obtrusive active or passive nanoscale sensors would provide feedback on product performance and environmental conditions during service by monitoring structural loads, temperatures, moisture content, decay fungi, heat losses or gains, and loss of conditioned air. Currently, however, research in these areas appears limited. Due to its natural origins, wood is leading the way in cross-disciplinary research and modelling techniques. BASF have developed a highly water repellent coating based on the actions of the lotus leaf as a result of the incorporation of silica and alumina nanoparticles and hydrophobic polymers. Mechanical studies of bones have been adapted to model wood, for instance in the drying process. Glass Research is being carried out on the application of nanotechnology to glass, another important material in construction. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles are used to coat glazing since it has sterilizing and anti-fouling properties. The particles catalyze powerful reactions that break down organic pollutants, volatile organic compounds and bacterial membranes. TiO2 is hydrophilic (attraction to water), which can attract rain drops that then wash off the dirt particles. Thus the introduction of nanotechnology in the Glass industry, incorporates the self- cleaning property of glass. Fire-protective glass is another application of nanotechnology. This is achieved by using a clear intumescent layer sandwiched between glass panels (an interlayer) formed of silica nanoparticles (SiO2), which turns into a rigid and opaque fire shield when heated. Most of glass in construction is on the exterior surface of buildings. So the light and heat entering the building through glass has to be prevented. The nanotechnology can provide a better solution to block light and heat coming through windows. Coatings Coatings is an important area in construction coatings are extensively use to paint the walls, doors, and windows. Coatings should provide a protective layer bound to the base material to produce a surface of the desired protective or functional properties. The coatings should have self healing capabilities through a process of \\"self-assembly\\". Nanotechnology is being applied to paints to obtained the coatings having self healing capabilities and corrosion protection under insulation. Since these coatings are hydrophobic and repels water from the metal pipe and can also protect metal from salt water attack. Nanoparticle based systems can provide better adhesion and transparency. The TiO2 coating captures and breaks down organic and inorganic air pollutants by a photocatalytic process, which leads to putting roads to good environmental use. Fire Protection and detection Fire resistance of steel structures is often provided by a coating produced by a spray-on-cementitious process. The nano-cement has the potential to create a new paradigm in this area of application because the resulting material can be used as a tough, durable, high temperature coating. It provides a good method of increasing fire resistance and this is a cheaper option than conventional insulation. Risks in construction In building construction nanomaterials are widely used from self-cleaning windows to flexible solar panels to wi-fi blocking paint. The self-healing concrete, materials to block ultraviolet and infrared radiation, smog-eating coatings and light-emitting walls and ceilings are the new nanomaterials in construction. Nanotechnology is a promise for making the \\"smart home\\" a reality. Nanotech-enabled sensors can monitor temperature, humidity, and airborne toxins, which needs nanotech-based improved batteries. The building components will be intelligent and interactive since the sensor uses wireless components, it can collect the wide range of data. If nanosensors and nanomaterials become an everyday part of the buildings, as with smart homes, what are the consequences of these materials on human beings? #Effect of nanoparticles on health and environment: Nanoparticles may also enter the body if building water supplies are filtered through commercially available nanofilters. Airborne and waterborne nanoparticles enter from building ventilation and wastewater systems. #Effect of nanoparticles on societal issues: As sensors become commonplace, a loss of privacy and autonomy may result from users interacting with increasingly intelligent building components.

Its highest point is the Pic des mouches at ; this is not however the highest point in Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne, which is instead found in the Sainte-Baume massif. The Croix de Provence is a notable feature of the mountain. At a height of 19 metres, this cross, although not placed at the highest point of the mountain, stands out from the ridge far more than the Pic des Mouches. The mountain is celebrated for its many appearances in a series of paintings by Paul C√©zanne (1839‚Äì1906), who could see it from near his house in nearby Aix-en-Provence. The Croix de Provence. History and tourism Originally called montagne de la Victoire, the mountain became known by Christians in the Middle Ages as Sainte-Venture. In the 13th century, a chapel was constructed at the summit. It was not until the 17th century that the mountain gained its current name. In 1989 a fire ravaged over 50 square kilometres of the mountain's south face. Much work has been done to promote reforestation, but the amount of vegetation, particularly conifers, remains much less than it was prior to the fire. Access to the mountain is now largely restricted during the summer. However, during the periods of free access, the Saint-Victoire massif is a popular destination for hiking, climbing, paragliding and, to a lesser extent, caving. Around 700,000 walkers use its paths every year. Artists Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley, Paul C√©zanne 1882-5 In addition to C√©zanne, Montagne Saint-Victoire has been a source of inspiration for other artists, for example: * It makes an appearance in the 1454 painting Coronation of the Virgin by Enguerrand Quarton. * The painter Pablo Picasso, who bought the Ch√¢teau de Vauvenargues, situated at the foot of the mountain, and installed a studio there between 1959 and 1962 * The painter Wassily Kandinsky * The painter Andr√© Masson (1896-1987) in The Red Lands and the Montagne Sainte Victoire, 1948 (Les Terres rouges et la Montagne Ste Victoire) * The writer Peter Handke with The Lesson of Sainte-Victoire (1980) * The writer Guy Gavriel Kay with Ysabel (2007) * The version by painter Mark Tansey (1987), \\"the soldiers of poststructuralism and deconstruction---Jean Baudrillard (seated second from left), Barthes (recumbent, lighting a cigarette), and Derrida (standing, removing his overcoat)---disrobe in the shadow of C√©zanne's mountain.

The CCAS opened in summer 2002 to be a community-run facility where artists and musicians could showcase their work. The CCAS is a mixed- used facility with frequent art exhibits and a large zine library, but it has functioned primarily as a music venue for smaller independent music acts.

It has outlasted similar venues in the area. The CCAS is collectively run, and allows members to teach and book shows. At monthly meetings, members discuss finances, membership, and maintenance and repair of the space. It is a non-discriminatory venue where people of all ages, genders, races, and religions may come and feel welcome. The venue is also drug- and alcohol-free.

The game is based on the movie of the same name, in which dragons have annihilated the majority of the human race, and the survivors attempt to fight back using scavenged military hardware. However, the plot differs significantly from the film. Gameplay The game allows the player to play as both a dragon and a human. As a human, the player takes the role of a survivor, in a third-person vehicle-based shooter - tanks and jeeps most notably, which can all carry rockets and machine gun turrets; if the player is touched by fire from a dragon they must find water to douse the flames or they will die. As a dragon, the player takes the role of a maturing dragon able to use fireballs to engage targets at range, napalm breath to set targets alight and using their talons to pick up items (including enemy combatants) and use them as makeshift bombs to attack ground targets. Plot The game's story is divided into two campaigns; human and dragon. The human campaign loosely follows the plot of the film, with significant differences. Meanwhile, the dragon campaign chronicles the early years of the human/dragon war up to the game's present timeline. The dragon campaign features an alternative ending in the final mission. Human The human campaign begins with the player taking the role of 'The Kid', a new recruit to the Kentucky Irregulars. Hailing from the former United States, The Irregulars are a group of paramilitary dragon slayers and are led by Denton Van Zan. The Irregulars defend The Fort, an old castle in Northumberland that houses a population of survivors led by Quinn Abercromby. The Irregulars are tasked with warding off attacks, firefighting, and rescuing civilians. Like in the film, Van Zan concludes that all dragons thus far have been female, and that there must be a single male that is key to reproduction. To prove his theory, Van Zan leads the Irregulars to the ruins of a coastal military base in Dover, now used by the dragons as a nesting ground. Upon arrival, Van Zan sends The Kid alone to retrieve dragon eggs while the majority of the brood is away. The Kid manages to successfully retrieve enough eggs before escaping the returning dragons with the Irregulars. Van Zan confirms his theory and leads the Irregulars to London, intending to kill the sole male dragon, known as The Bull. Once in London, the Irregulars face heavy resistance from the dragons. Van Zan devises a plan to lure out The Bull by destroying several dragon nests. The plan is successful and The Bull arrives. Quinn distracts The Bull while The Kid, Van Zan, and the remaining Irregulars concentrate fire on The Bull, eventually critically injuring The Bull's wings. Van Zan sends The Kid to finish off The Bull deep in dragon territory. After a long and difficult battle, The Kid kills The Bull, ending the dragon threat. Dragon In the dragon campaign, the player assumes the role of a young dragon with higher than normal intelligence, evident by her ability to adapt and exploit situations tactically and strategically. The campaign begins during the early years of the human-dragon war, in which organized human resistance is still significant, but waning. The player dragon assists her sisters in assaulting the Tower of London, the last human stronghold in the city. The dragons are victorious, obliterating the Tower and a nearby warship, pushing the humans out of London. Some time later, the player dragon attempts to rescue captured dragons from an armoured train heading to a large coastal military base in Dover (the same base featured in the human campaign). The player dragon rescues her sisters and destroys the train, before following the tracks to the base. The base is heavily defended, with the base's array of large-calibre artillery posing a significant threat to the dragons. The player dragon sneaks into the base from the ocean port, annihilating coastal guns, anti-air defences, warships, and finally the superguns. With their last line of defence destroyed, the human military presence in England is broken and the remaining survivors scattered. The game jumps forward to the year 2020. The player dragon, now fully mature, repeatedly clashes with the Kentucky Irregulars and the survivors in The Fort. The player dragon causes chaos by disrupting Irregular operations and destroying The Fort's food supply. The final mission also presents an alternative ending, in which the dragons assault The Fort with the assistance of The Bull. Despite heavy resistance, the dragons wipe out the defenders and destroy The Fort, permanently establishing dragons as the dominant species.

The game has been described by Midway as ‚Äúthe only mission-based combat driving game set in a post- apocalyptic world.‚Äù Gameplay RoadKill is a vehicular combat game, and its gameplay is very similar to Twisted Metal, with a mission-based storyline and open-world elements inspired by Grand Theft Auto III. The player character assumes control of an improvised combat vehicle, performs a variety of missions to progress through the game's storyline, has an option for free-roam and is able to commit certain actions to increase their criminal ranks, such as attacking rival gangs, destroying enemy vehicles or creating havoc in the city. The player starts with only one vehicle to choose, though more vehicles can be unlocked as the game progresses, either by completing certain missions or by participating in a scavenger hunt. To fit the post-apocalyptic setting, most vehicles are heavily modified and armored 1970s muscle cars, SUV's, pickup trucks and vans; all of which are armed with mounted machine guns. Additional weapons, such as RPGs, guided missiles, sniper rifles and various explosives, can be obtained or purchased throughout the game with limited ammunition. In several missions, the player is required to control the turret gun to attack enemies whilst driven around. The main goal of the game is to increase the criminal reputation of the player in the form of \\"ranks\\". Criminal ranks can be achieved by killing or attacking rival gangs, destroying vehicles and street racing. The game features three different islands of the city, and each island has its own boss, whom the player engages in a one-on- one battle to unlock the next island and progress through the storyline. In order to confront the boss, the player must complete storyline missions and jobs given by other characters, most of whom are gang leaders. Storyline missions would also unlock various customizations, weapons and vehicles. Upon completion of certain missions or side jobs, the player is able to purchase upgrades. Upgrades allow any vehicle to have its performance improved, increased ammunition capacity, or added armor for better protection against enemy attacks. Upgrades can be obtained by visiting special garages labeled as \\"shops\\", in exchange for money. As the game progresses, the player unlocks and obtains more weapons and vehicles. Unlocked vehicles can be accessed in the player's garage, and new weapons would spawn at various points in the city or in front of the garage. Vehicles come in two types; normal and gang- affiliated. Gang-affiliated cars are mostly distinguished by their brighter colors and appear to be more customized when compared to normal cars. Driving a gang-affiliated vehicle will cause a certain opposing gang to become hostile and continuously attack the player on sight until he escapes their territory. Likewise, driving a law enforcement vehicle will cause all gangs in the entire city to attack and attempt to kill the protagonist, making the game more challenging. In addition, the game also features a \\"Riot\\" level which determines the number of police and enemy gangs that chase the player. When the Riot level is at maximum, the player automatically enters a \\"Survival\\" mission; where the goal is to evade and survive attacks from both the police and rival gangs. Said level can be gained by destroying police vehicles and killing any nearby police officers on the streets. Plot The game takes place a fictional city known as \\"Hell County\\" after a deadly pandemic called \\"The Rot\\" broke out before the events of the game and proceeded to wipe out most of the population of the city. Law and order collapses and gangs roam free to engage in warfare using vehicles armed with guns and explosives throughout every community. The city is split into three districts; the commercial district, (\\"Lava Falls\\"), the industrial district (\\"Blister Canyon\\"), and the residential district (\\"Paradise City\\"). In the aftermath of the chaos, a survivor named Mason Strong arrives in Lava Falls after escaping from a ruthless terrorist organization known as the \\"Sentinels\\", led by Axl, who is a corrupt police that he used to assist and are set on recreating law and order by building a dictatorship, with a goal of eliminating other gangs and enslaving survivors in the city. Mason went against them because of this and thus, was betrayed and left for dead. While in Lava Falls, Mason is hired by the Daredevils, a British punk gang led by a psychopathic pimp named Woody. After being falsely accused of dealing with a rival Hispanic gang, Mason ends up in a shootout against the Daredevils and kills Woody in the process. He travels to Blister Canyon and finds a new employer, General Warwick - an former military officer and his right-hand man Gunny. Mason helps Warwick and Gunny against the Talons, a tattooed skinhead gang vying for control on the city. After defending Warwick's businesses , Mason is sent to assassinate the Talons' leaders Drake and Grim, before making his way into Paradise City to be hired by a gang named South League. Mason helps the South League defend their from a rival syndicate called Dreg Lords, and he is introduced to their leader, Knox, who offers him alliance and protection against the Sentinels. After doing a few jobs for Knox, he is hired for one final job; destroying Sentinels' generators that power their propaganda broadcasts with bomb-planted RC cars. Afterwards, Mason confronts Axl personally before engaging in a climactic battle, with Axl using a tank-like vehicle and his henchmen pursuing Mason on the streets. Mason kills all of Axl's henchmen before destroying Axl's vehicle. Axl crawls from the wreckage and attempts to shoot Mason, only to be run over by a bus. With Axl's rule completely taken down, Mason hears a radio broadcast from other survivors, pleading for help and claims someone has set things right. Mason then drives away to an unknown location. Reception The game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

She is author or editor of more than 25 books and more than 500 articles on education policy and practice. Her work focuses on school restructuring, teacher education, and educational equity. She was education advisor to Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and was reportedly among candidates for United States Secretary of Education in the Obama administration. Education Darling- Hammond was born in Cleveland, Ohio.Linda Darling-Hammond Darling-Hammond received her B.A. magna cum laude at Yale University in 1973, and an Ed.D. (Doctor of Education), with highest distinction, in urban education at Temple University in 1978 Darling-Hammond's Resume at Stanford University Career Darling-Hammond began her career as a public school teacher in Pennsylvania, from 1973 to 1974. In 1985, after completing her doctorate degree program, she began working as a Social Scientist for the RAND Corporation. Darling-Hammond was a Senior Social Scientist and Director of the RAND Education and Human Resources Program when she departed for academia in 1989. From 1989 to 1998, Darling-Hammond was a professor of education at Teachers College, Columbia University. She came to Stanford in 1998. In September 2015, Darling-Hammond launched the Learning Policy Institute, a research and policy think tank, with headquarters in Palo Alto, California, and an office in Washington, D.C. She serves as president and chief executive officer. In 2019 California Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed Darling-Hammond to succeed Michael Kirst as president of the California State Board of Education. Darling-Hammond was president of the American Educational Research Association and a member of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. She has served on the boards of directors for the Spencer Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and the Alliance for Excellent Education.  Policy work on equity, quality, and teaching  Darling-Hammond has been engaged in efforts to redesign schools. As Chair of the Model Standards Committee of the Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (INTASC), she led the effort to develop licensing standards for beginning teachers. As Chair of the New York State Council on Curriculum and Assessment she oversaw the process of developing the state's learning standards, curriculum frameworks, and assessments during the early 1990s.New York State Council on Curriculum and Assessment. (1994). Learning-centered curriculum and assessment for New York State. Albany: New York State Education Department. From 1994-2001, Darling- Hammond served as executive director of the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, chaired by Governor James B. Hunt, a blue-ribbon panel whose work put the issue of teaching quality on the map nationally and led to sweeping policy changes affecting teaching and schooling. Under her leadership, the commission carried out a strategy to build understanding and action for leveraging major improvements. The commission developed a national coalition as well as state and local partnerships in more than 25 states that built engagement and commitment to the issue of teacher quality, leading both to legislative changes and organizational reforms of schools and teacher education programs. The commission also carried out a public education campaign that brought the issue of teacher quality to a high level of public visibility. In 2006, Education Week named the commission's lead report, \\"What Matters Most: Teaching for America's Future,\\" one of the most influential research studies affecting U.S. education.Influential Research Studies.

She has also received numerous awards for her work over the course of her career.  Learning and teaching standards  While William F. Russell Professor at Teachers College, Columbia, Darling-Hammond co-founded the National Center for Restructuring Education, Schools, and Teaching (NCREST), which documented highly successful school models and supported a range of school reform initiatives in New York and nationally. As Chair of New York State's Council on Curriculum and Assessment in the early 1990s, she helped to fashion a comprehensive school reform plan for the state that developed new learning standards and curriculum frameworks to focus on learning goals and more performance-oriented assessments. This led to an overhaul of the state Regents examinations as well as innovations in school-based performance assessments and investments in new approaches to professional development. Chapter 7, describes this work and its outcomes. As Chair of the Model Standards Committee of the Chief State School Officers' Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (INTASC), she led the development of licensing standards for beginning teachers. These were ultimately incorporated into the licensing standards of more than 40 states and became the foundation for a new teacher certification standards related to teaching competencies rather than merely the counting of course credits.‚ÄúStandard Setting in Teaching: Changes in Licensing, Certification, and Assessment.‚Äù In Virginia Richardson (ed.), Handbook Of Research On Teaching, 4th Edition, pp. 751-776. Washington, DC: American Educational Research Association, 2001. She has been instrumental in developing performance assessments that allow teachers to demonstrate their classroom teaching skills as they are applied in practice, as an early member of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and, later as a co-founder of the Performance Assessment for California Teachers (PACT). The PACT consortium, comprising more than 30 university- and school-based teacher preparation programs, has designed and is implementing a performance assessment that examines how teachers plan, teach, and evaluate student learning in the classroom. The PACT assessments are now authorized for use in licensing California teachers.Education Week Performance Test for New Calif. Teachers Approved  Developing schools and programs  Darling-Hammond began her career as a public school teacher and has co-founded both a preschool/day care center and a charter public high school serving low-income students of color in East Palo Alto, California. In a community where only a third of students were graduating and almost none were going onto college, this new Early College High school ‚Äì which admits students by lottery ‚Äì has created a pipeline to college for more than 90 percent of its graduates. The school, along with seven others, is a professional development school partner with the Stanford Teacher Education Program (STEP), which prepares teachers for high-needs schools. Darling-Hammond led the redesign of the STEP program for this new program, and its successes have been acknowledged through recognition in several studies as one of the nation's top programs. Darling- Hammond has worked with dozens of schools and districts around the nation on studying, developing, and scaling up new model schools‚Äîas well as launching preparation programs for teachers and leaders. Through the School Redesign Network (SRN) at Stanford University, she worked with a network of urban districts to redesign schools and district offices. Darling-Hammond has said, \\"Lagging far behind our international peers in educational outcomes--and with one of the most unequal educational systems in the industrialized world--we need, I believe, something much more than and much different from what NCLB offers.‚Äù She also praised the law for drawing attention to achievement gaps and for the right of all children to well-qualified teachers. She has suggested that, in addition to these major breakthroughs, ‚ÄúWe badly need a national policy that enables schools to meet the intellectual demands of the twenty-first century (and) we need to pay off the educational debt to disadvantaged students that has accrued over centuries of unequal access to quality education.‚Äù She has suggested that federal spending on education is inadequate to achieve the goals of the law. Darling-Hammond on Teach For America Though Darling-Hammond has acknowledged that Teach For America has brought new talent into the teaching profession, she is better known as a prominent critic of the program.Uncertainty over Obama Education Adviser by Alexander Russo, The Huffington Post, November 10, 2008 In the spring of 2005, a study published by Stanford researchers including Darling-Hammond, concluded that teachers in Houston who entered without completing training and certification, including Teach For America teachers, were initially less effective than traditionally credentialed teachers and left the teaching profession at higher rates. \\"Our study doesn't say you shouldn't hire Teach For America teachers,\\" said Darling-Hammond. \\"Our study says everyone benefits from preparation, including Teach For America teachers‚Äîthat they became more effective when they became certified.\\" Candidacy for Secretary of Education In 2008, Darling-Hammond was viewed as one of the most likely candidates for United States Secretary of Education in the Obama administration. At the time, others rumored to be under consideration included New York City Schools Chancellor Joel Klein, Jonathan Schnur, chief executive of New Leaders, and Arne Duncan, chief executive officer of the Chicago Public Schools.

In 1994, Ruppel sold the magazine to Gianni Ellefsen, who distributed SLUG nationally, as well as locally. On November 9, 1999, Rick Ziegler, then owner of Salt City Records, received a cease and desist letter from Anne M. Wall, Brand Protection Manager for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic Winter Games of 2002, regarding ads that ran in the magazine.http://www.slugmag.com/pdf/132-december-1999.pdf The magazine printed the letter in its December issue and adopted a phrase from it, ‚ÄúNeither Humorous Nor Appropriate,‚Äù as its slogan. In 2000, SLUG managing editor Angela H. Brown, an employee of SLUG since 1997, purchased the magazine from Ellefsen. Brown, a freelance writer and photographer from Utah, took the magazine back to its local roots, while also continuing the magazine‚Äôs coverage of national music acts. In 2014, SLUG received 9 awards from the Utah Headliners Chapters of the Society of Professional Journalists. SLUG is now printed in color on newsprint. Since 2000, SLUG‚Äôs circulation has increased from 15,000 to 32,000 copies throughout Utah.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Alberta Mill Complex. It is also a host for numerous local live performances and other cultural events. History Built in 1898 by Thomas F. Lloyd, it was formerly a cotton mill known as the Alberta Cotton Mill. By 1913, it had become one of the world's largest hardwood cross-tie makers, shipping them on train tracks adjacent to the mall that continue past Carrboro to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 1909, the Julian Carr family bought the mill. In 1913 Carrboro, previously known as West End, was renamed \\"Venable\\" in honor of Francis P. Venable, the president of the University of North Carolina at that time. The mill closed by 1930. In 1945, the mill re- opened and remained open until the 1960s. In 1974, the Carrboro Board of Aldermen voted to have the building torn down to build a shopping mall on the site. In light of community opposition to the plan, the idea was scrapped, and the mill complex was renovated and reopened as Carr Mill Mall. The complex now houses numerous restaurants and stores as well as commercial office space on its upper levels. Weaver Street Market, Carrboro's co-op grocery, is one of the primary tenants of the complex and sponsors numerous outdoor events and performances on the lawn in front of Carr Mill Mall. The song \\"Freight Train\\" by Elizabeth 'Libba\\" Cotten was inspired by the train that ran on the State University Railroad spur past her house on Lloyd St, and which served the needs of Carr Mill. Cotten wrote the song in the early 1900s, as a young teenager.

These 100 Œºm to 2 mm thick coatings of thermally insulating materials serve to insulate components from large and prolonged heat loads and can sustain an appreciable temperature difference between the load-bearing alloys and the coating surface. In doing so, these coatings can allow for higher operating temperatures while limiting the thermal exposure of structural components, extending part life by reducing oxidation and thermal fatigue. In conjunction with active film cooling, TBCs permit working fluid temperatures higher than the melting point of the metal airfoil in some turbine applications. Due to increasing demand for more efficient engines running at higher temperatures with better durability/lifetime and thinner coatings to reduce parasitic mass for rotating/moving components, there is significant motivation to develop new and advanced TBCs. The material requirements of TBCs are similar to those of heat shields, although in the latter application emissivity tends to be of greater importance. Structure TBC and associated layers. Cooling air is often flowed through the metal substrate to enhance cooling.An effective TBC needs to meet certain requirements to perform well in aggressive thermo-mechanical environments. To deal with thermal expansion stresses during heating and cooling, adequate porosity is needed, as well as appropriate matching of thermal expansion coefficients with the metal surface that the TBC is coating. Phase stability is required to prevent significant volume changes (which occur during phase changes), which would cause the coating to crack or spall. In air-breathing engines, oxidation resistance is necessary, as well as decent mechanical properties for rotating/moving parts or parts in contact. Therefore, general requirements for an effective TBC can be summarize as needing: 1) a high melting point. 2) no phase transformation between room temperature and operating temperature. 3) low thermal conductivity. 4) chemical inertness. 5) similar thermal expansion match with the metallic substrate. 6) good adherence to the substrate. 7) low sintering rate for a porous microstructure. These requirements severely limit the number of materials that can be used, with ceramic materials usually being able to satisfy the required properties. Thermal barrier coatings typically consist of four layers: the metal substrate, metallic bond coat, thermally-grown oxide (TGO), and ceramic topcoat. The ceramic topcoat is typically composed of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) which is desirable for having very low conductivity while remaining stable at nominal operating temperatures typically seen in applications. This ceramic layer creates the largest thermal gradient of the TBC and keeps the lower layers at a lower temperature than the surface. However, above 1200 ¬∞C, YSZ suffers from unfavorable phase transformations, going from t'-tetragonal to tetragonal to cubic to monoclinic. Such phase transformations lead to crack formation within the top coating. Recent advancements in finding an alternative for YSZ ceramic topcoat identified many novel ceramics (rare earth zirconates) having superior performance at temperatures above 1200 ¬∞C, however with inferior fracture toughness compared to that of YSZ. In addition, such zirconates may have a high concentration of oxygen ion vacancies, which may facilitate oxygen transport and exacerbate the formation of the TGO. With a large enough TGO, spalling of the coating may occur, which is a catastrophic mode of failure for TBCs. The use of such coatings would require addition coatings that are more oxidation resistant, such as alumina or mullite. The bond-coat is an oxidation-resistant metallic layer which is deposited directly on top of the metal substrate. It is typically 75-150 Œºm thick and made of a NiCrAlY or NiCoCrAlY alloy, though other bond coats made of Ni and Pt aluminides also exist. The primary purpose of the bond-coat is to protect the metal substrate from oxidation and corrosion, particularly from oxygen and corrosive elements that pass through the porous ceramic top-coat. At peak operating conditions found in gas-turbine engines with temperatures in excess of 700 ¬∞C, oxidation of the bond-coat leads to the formation of a thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer. Formation of the TGO layer is inevitable for many high-temperature applications, so thermal barrier coatings are often designed so that the TGO layer grows slowly and uniformly. Such a TGO will have a structure that has a low diffusivity for oxygen, so that further growth is controlled by diffusion of metal from the bond-coat rather than the diffusion of oxygen from the top- coat. The TBC can also be locally modified at the interface between the bondcoat and the thermally grown oxide so that it acts as a thermographic phosphor, which allows for remote temperature measurement Failure TBCs fail through various degradation modes that include mechanical rumpling of bond coat during thermal cyclic exposure, especially, coatings in aircraft engines; accelerated oxidation, hot corrosion, molten deposit degradation. There are also issues with oxidation (areas of the TBC getting stripped off) of the TBC, which reduces the life of the metal drastically, which leads to thermal fatigue. A key feature of all TBC components is well matched thermal expansion coefficients between all layers. Thermal barrier coatings expand and contract at different rates upon heating and cooling of the environment, so materials when the different layers have poorly matched thermal expansion coefficients, a strain is introduced which can lead to cracking and ultimately failure of the coating. Cracking at the thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer between the top-coat and bond-coat is the most common failure mode for gas turbine blade coatings. TGO growth produces a stress associated with the volume expansion which persists at all temperatures. When the system is cooled, even more mismatch is introduced from the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients. The result is very high (2-6GPa) stresses which occur at low temperature and can produce cracking and ultimately fracture of the barrier coating. TGO formation also results in depletion of Al in the bond- coat. This can lead to the formation of undesirable phases which contribute to the mismatch stress. These processes are all accelerated by the thermal cycling which occurs in many thermal barrier coating applications.  Types   YSZ  YSZ is the most widely studied and used TBC because it provides excellent performance in applications such as diesel engines and gas turbines. Additionally, it was one of the few refractory oxides that could be deposited as thick films using the then-known technology of plasma spraying. As for properties, it has low thermal conductivity, high thermal expansion coefficient, and low thermal shock resistance. However, it has a fairly low operating limit of 1200¬∞C due to phase instability, and can corrode due to its oxygen transparency.  Mullite  Mullite is a compound of alumina and silica, with the formula 3Al2O3-2SiO2. It has a low density, along with good mechanical properties, high thermal stability, low thermal conductivity, and is corrosion and oxidation resistant. However, it suffers from crystallization and volume contraction above 800¬∞C, which leads to cracking and delamination. Therefore, this material is suitable as a zirconia alternative for applications such as diesel engines, where surface temperatures are relatively low and temperature variations across the coating may be large.  Alumina  Only Œ±-phase Al2O3 is stable among aluminum oxides. With a high hardness and chemical inertness, but high thermal conductivity and low thermal expansion coefficient, alumina is often used as an addition to an existing TBC coating. By incorporating alumina in YSZ TBC, oxidation and corrosion resistance can be improved, as well as hardness and bond strength without significant change in the elastic modulus or toughness. One challenge with alumina is applying the coating through plasma spraying, which tends to create a variety of unstable phases, such as Œ≥-alumina. When these phases eventually transform into the stable Œ±-phase through thermal cycling, a significant volume change of ~15% (Œ≥ to Œ±) follows, which can lead to microcrack formation in the coating.  CeO2 + YSZ  CeO2 (Ceria) has a higher thermal expansion coefficient and lower thermal conductivity than YSZ. Adding ceria into a YSZ coating can significantly improve the TBC performance, especially in thermal shock resistance. This is most likely due to less bond coat stress due to better insulation and a better net thermal expansion coefficient. Some negative effects of the addition of ceria include the decrease of hardness and accelerated rate of sintering of the coating (less porous).  Rare-earth zirconates  La2Zr2O7, also referred to as LZ, is an example of a rare-earth zirconate that shows potential for use as a TBC. This material is phase stable up to its melting point and can largely tolerate vacancies on any of its sublattices. Along with the ability for site-substitution with other elements, this means that thermal properties could potentially be tailored. Although it also has very low thermal conductivity compared to YSZ, it also has a low thermal expansion coefficient and low toughness.  Rare earth oxides  The mixture of rare earth oxides is readily available, cheap, and may have promise as effective TBCs. The coatings of rare earth oxides (ex: La2O3, Nb2O5, Pr2O3, CeO2 as main phases) have lower thermal conductivity and higher thermal expansion coefficients when compared to YSZ. The main challenge to overcome is the polymorphic nature of most rare earth oxides at elevated temperatures, as phase instability tends to negatively impact thermal shock resistance.  Metal-Glass Composites  A powder mixture of metal and normal glass can be plasma-sprayed in vacuum, with a suitable composition resulting in a TBC comparable to YSZ. Additionally, metal-glass composites have superior bond- coat adherence, higher thermal expansion coefficients, and no open porosity, which prevents oxidation of the bond-coat. Uses Thermal barrier coating on an automotive exhaust system component Thermal barrier coating on a carbon composite material Automotive Thermal barrier ceramic coatings are becoming more common in automotive applications. They are specifically designed to reduce heat loss from engine exhaust system components including exhaust manifolds, turbocharger casings, exhaust headers, downpipes and tailpipes. This process is also known as \\"exhaust heat management\\". When used under-bonnet, these have the positive effect of reducing engine bay temperatures, therefore reducing the intake air temperature. Although most ceramic coatings are applied to metallic parts directly related to the engine exhaust system, technological advances now allow thermal barrier coatings to be applied via plasma spray onto composite materials. It is now commonplace to find ceramic-coated components in modern engines and on high-performance components in race series such as Formula 1. As well as providing thermal protection, these coatings are also used to prevent physical degradation of the composite material due to friction. This is possible because the ceramic material bonds with the composite (instead of merely sticking on the surface with paint), thereby forming a tough coating that doesn't chip or flake easily. Although thermal barrier coatings have been applied to the insides of exhaust system components, problems have been encountered because of the difficulty in preparing the internal surface prior to coating. Aviation Interest in increasing the efficiency of gas turbine engines for aviation applications has prompted research into higher combustion temperatures. Turbine efficiency is strongly correlated with combustion temperature. Higher temperature combustion improves the thermodynamic efficiency of the machine, giving a more favourable ratio of work generated in relation to waste heat.Heat engineThermal barrier coatings are commonly used to protect nickel- based superalloys from both melting and thermal cycling in aviation turbines. Combined with cool air flow, TBCs increase the allowable gas temperature above that of the superalloy melting point. To avoid the difficulties associated with the melting point of superalloys, many researchers are investigating ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs) as high-temperature alternatives. Generally, these are made from fiber-reinforced SiC. Rotating parts are especially good candidates for the material change due to the enormous fatigue that they endure. Not only do CMCs have better thermal properties, but they are also lighter meaning that less fuel would be needed to produce the same thrust for the lighter aircraft. The material change is, however, not without consequences. At high temperatures, these CMCs are reactive with water and form gaseous silicon hydroxide compounds that corrode the CMC. SiOH2 \\\\+ H2O = SiO(OH)2 SiOH2 \\\\+ 2H2O = Si(OH)4 2SiOH2 \\\\+ 3H2O = Si2O(OH)6 The thermodynamic data for these reactions has been experimentally determined over many years to determine that Si(OH)4 is generally the dominant vapor species. Even more advanced environmental barrier coatings are required to protect these CMCs from water vapor as well as other environmental degradants. For instance, as the gas temperatures increase towards 1400 K-1500 K, sand particles begin to melt and react with coatings. The melted sand is generally a mixture of calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, aluminum oxide, and silicon oxide (commonly referred to as CMAS). Many research groups are investigating the harmful effects of CMAS on turbine coatings and how to prevent damage. CMAS is a large barrier to increasing the combustion temperature of gas turbine engines and will need to be solved before turbines see a large increase in efficiency from temperature increase. Processing In industry, thermal barrier coatings are produced in a number of ways: * Electron beam physical vapor deposition: EBPVD * Air plasma spray: APS * High velocity oxygen fuel: HVOF * Electrostatic spray-assisted vapor deposition: ESAVD * Direct vapor deposition Additionally, the development of advanced coatings and processing methods is a field of active research. One such example is the Solution precursor plasma spray process, which has been used to create TBCs with some of the lowest reported thermal conductivities without sacrificing thermal cyclic durability.

It was produced by Jennings and Willie Nelson. Recording Although Jennings had won artistic autonomy from RCA in 1972, giving him the freedom to produce his own records, he was still irritated by RCA executives, who kept a close eye on his recording sessions at RCA Victor Studios and had even delayed the release of his 1973 album Honky Tonk Heroes. In his autobiography, Jennings wrote that although he had agreed to record in their studios, the RCA engineers were constantly calling upstairs to executive Jerry Bradley, keeping him aware of everything Jennings did. Fed up with the aggravation, Jennings decided to record his next album at Tompall Glaser's studio at 916 Nineteenth Avenue South, nicknamed \\"Hillbilly Central,\\" with Willie Nelson co-producing. Glaser, a Nashville veteran who had achieved fame with the Glaser Brothers, had co-produced Honky Tonk Heroes, a touchstone of the outlaw country movement. In his book Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville, author Michael Striessguth describes the atmosphere at the studio, which contrasted sharply with RCA's strict recording traditions: :\\"Its doors propped open to let in the young breezes sweeping through the West End, the so-called Hillbilly Central offices became an outlaw safe haven. Former employees recalled Willie Nelson lazing on the front lawn, and Waylon haunting the offices at three in the morning...The studio hosted a fraternity of singers, songwriters and Nashville dropouts living the verse of a strumming and bumming honky tonk song...Sessions burned into the small hours until Tompall and his entourage peeled out into the streets in search of pinball machines, drinks, and greasy food.\\" According to Streissguth, the first song Jennings recorded at Glaser's studio in October 1973 was J.J. Cale's \\"Louisiana Women\\" with Kyle Lehning engineering. Lehning, who would achieve fame in the 1980s producing albums for Randy Travis, contributed Wurlitzer electric piano to the Cale song and the trumpet part to \\"Heaven and Hell.\\" \\"You just can't believe how different everything sounded when he moved from RCA,\\" Glaser explained in the 2003 documentary Beyond Nashville. \\"The bottom was fat and big again...You could hear the drum, it wasn't a little tick in the back. It was marvellous.\\" Jennings agreed, stating, \\"There was a freedom there that I didn't have any place else. Both of us could experiment...It was a fraternity, and Nashville was our college town.\\" Composition Overall, This Time has a more laid-back feel than its defiant predecessor. Four of the twelve songs on the LP were written by Nelson and included on his Phases and Stages concept album, which was released earlier that same year. Nelson also sang on \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and contributed guitar to the album. The title track became Jennings' first chart-topping smash in June 1974. In the authorized video biography Renegade Outlaw Legend, the singer revealed, \\"I wrote that song five years before and whoever was producing me then at RCA said it was no good. I was going through some old tapes and happened to find it.\\" Jennings added that he wanted to throw the song away but was persuaded not to by drummer Ritchie Albright. The album also marked the first time Jennings recorded a song written by Miriam Eddy, the ex-wife of producer Duane Eddy, who later changed her name to Jessi Colter and became Waylon's wife. Playing up to his outlaw personae, Jennings recorded the aptly titled \\"Slow Movin' Outlaw\\" and also included Texan songwriter Billy Joe Shaver's \\"Slow Rollin' Low.\\" This Time was reissued in 1999 with five bonus tracks featuring several songs famously sung by Buddy Holly. Produced by Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Duane Eddy, these tracks feature The Crickets, Holly's backing band, as musicians and backing vocalists. Reception This Time peaked at #4 on the Billboard country albums chart, his best showing there since 1967. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic writes, \\"It's not that the monochromaticity makes it a lesser affair than its predecessor, yet the whole thing does feel a bit reserved and not quite as overpowering as a sequel to Honky Tonk Heroes should be. Still, it's a first-rate record - perhaps not a classic, but a subdued, understated album unlike anything in his catalog.\\" Track listing #\\"This Time\\" (Waylon Jennings) ‚Äì 2:26 #\\"Louisiana Women\\" (J.J.

He lived first among the Apache and then the Comanche but eventually returned to his family later in life. The phenomenon of a white child raised by Indians made him a notable figure in the United States. He published his autobiography, Nine Years Among the Indians in 1927. Early life Herman Lehmann was born near Mason, Texas, on June 5, 1859, to German immigrants Ernst Moritz Lehmann and his wife Augusta Johanna Adams Lehmann. He was a third child, following a brother Gustave Adolph born in 1855, and a sister Wilhelmina who was born in 1857. Following the birth of Herman, the Lehmans had another son William F. born in 1861. Augusta had three more daughters, Emeliyn, Caroline Wilhelmina and Mathilde, but their birth order is unclear, as it is unclear whether these were children of Lehmann or her second husband Buchmeier. Moritz Lehmann died in 1862, and Augusta married local stonemason Philip Buchmeier in 1863.Mochino (2007) p.412 Capture On May 16, 1870, a raiding party of eight to ten Apaches (probably Lipans) captured Herman Lehmann, who was almost eleven, and his eight-year-old brother, Willie, while they were in the fields at their mother's request to scare the birds from the wheat. Their two sisters escaped without injury.Chebetah et al.: Chevato, pp. 81, 82, 91 Four days later, the Apache raiding party encountered a patrol of ten African-American cavalrymen led by Sgt. Emanuel Stance, who had been sent from Fort McKavett to recover the two Lehmann boys. In the short battle that followed, Willie Lehmann was able to escape, but the Apaches fled with young Herman. (Sergeant Stance became the first black regular to receive a Medal of Honor for his bravery on this mission.) The kidnapping site was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1991, Marker number 11283. Life with the Apaches A few months after Lehman's capture, the Apaches lied and told Lehmann they had killed his entire family, depriving him of any incentive to attempt escape.Mochino (2007) p.415 The Apaches took Herman Lehmann to their village in eastern New Mexico. He was adopted by a man named Carnoviste and his wife, Laughing Eyes. A year after his capture, General William T. Sherman passed through Loyal Valley on an inspection tour. Augusta Lehmann Buchmeier was granted a private audience with Sherman to plead for his assistance in finding her son. The Apaches called Lehmann \\"En Da\\" (White Boy). He spent about six years with them and became assimilated into their culture, rising to the position of petty chief. As a young warrior, one of his most memorable battles was a running fight with the Texas Rangers on August 24, 1875, which took place near Fort Concho, about 65 miles west of the site of San Angelo, Texas. Ranger James Gillett nearly shot Lehmann before he realized he was a white captive. When the Rangers tried to find Lehmann later, he escaped by crawling through the grass.Lehmann, Nine years, op. cit., p. 106 ff. Asylum with the Comanches Around the spring of 1876, Herman Lehmann killed an Apache medicine man avenging his killing of Carnoviste, his chief and master. Fearing revenge, he fled from the Apaches and spent a year alone in hiding. He became lonely and decided to search for a Comanche tribe that he might join. He observed a tribe all day long then entered the camp just after dark. At first they were going to kill him, however, a young warrior approached him that spoke the Apache tongue. Lehmann then explained his situation‚Äîthat he was born white adopted by the Indians and that he left the Apaches after killing the medicine man. Another brave came forward verifying his story and he was welcomed to stay. He joined the Comanches who gave him a new name, Montechema (meaning unknown).Lehmann, Nine years, op. cit., p. 144 ff. In the spring of 1877, Lehmann and the Comanches attacked buffalo hunters on the high plains of Texas. Lehmann was wounded by hunters in a surprise attack on the Indian camp at Yellow House Canyon (present-day Lubbock, Texas) on March 18, 1877, the last major fight between Indians and non-Indians in Texas. In July 1877, Comanche chief Quanah Parker, who had successfully negotiated the surrender of the last fighting Comanches in 1875, was sent in search of the renegades. Herman Lehmann was among the group that Quanah found camped on the Pecos River in eastern New Mexico. Quanah persuaded them to quit fighting and come to the Indian reservation near Fort Sill, Indian Territory (in present-day Oklahoma). While Lehmann initially refused to go to the reservation, he later followed at Quanah's request.La Vere (2005) p.79 Return and adjustment Herman Lehmann lived with Quanah Parker's family on the Kiowa-Comanche reservation in 1877-78. Several people took notice of the white boy living among the Indians. Lehmann's mother still searched for her son. She questioned Colonel Mackenzie, the commanding officer of Fort Sill, whether there were any blue eyed boys on the reservation. He said yes; however, the description led them to believe that this was not her boy. Nevertheless, she requested that the boy be brought to her.Chebetah et al.: Chevato, p. 113 In April 1878, Lt. Col. John W. Davidson ordered that Lehmann be sent under guard to his family in Texas. Five soldiers and a driver escorted Lehmann on a four-mule-drawn ambulance to Loyal Valley in Mason County, Texas. Lehmann arrived in Loyal Valley with an escort of soldiers on May 12, 1878, eight years after his capture. The people of Loyal Valley gathered to see the captive boy brought home. Upon his arrival, neither he nor his mother recognized one another. Lehmann had long believed his family dead, for the Apache had shown him proof during his time of transition to their way of life. It was his sister who found a scar on his arm, which had been caused by her when they were playing with a hatchet. His family surrounded him welcoming him home and the distant memories began to come back. Hearing someone repeat \\"Herman\\", he thought that sounded familiar and then realized it was his own name.Lehmann, Nine years, op. cit., p. 202 At first, he was sullen and wanted nothing to do with his mother and siblings. As he put it, \\"I was an Indian, and I did not like them because they were palefaces.\\" Lehmann's readjustment to his original culture was slow and painful. He rejected food offered, and was unaccustomed to sleeping in a bed. Herman Lehmann's first memoir, written with the assistance of Jonathan H. Jones, was published in 1899 under the title A Condensed History of the Apache and Comanche Indian Tribes for Amusement and General Knowledge (also known as Indianology). Lehmann hated this book for he felt Jonathan had taken liberty to fluff it up a bit. Throughout his life, Herman Lehmann drifted between two very different cultures. Lehmann was a very popular figure in southwestern Oklahoma and the Texas Hill Country, appearing at county fairs and rodeos. To thrill audiences, such as he did in 1925 at the Old Settlers Reunion in Mason County, he would chase a calf around an arena, kill it with arrows, jump off his horse, cut out the calf's liver, and eat it raw. His second autobiography, Nine Years Among the Indians (1927, edited by J. Marvin Hunter) was at the request of Lehmann. He requested that this time the book be written just as he told it. It is one of the finest captivity narratives in American literature, according to J. Frank Dobie. Herman Lehmann's story also inspired Mason County native Fred Gipson's novel Savage Sam, a sequel to Old Yeller. Personal life and death *July 16, 1885 - Herman Lehmann married N.E. Burke. The marriage ended in divorce, with conflicting accounts of the cause.Zesch (2004) p.242 *March 4, 1896 - Lehman married Fannie Light. The couple had two sons (Henry and John) and three daughters (Amelia, May, and Caroline). Although Lehman deserted his second wife in Oklahoma in 1926, a divorce was never filed. Upon Lehmann's death, Fannie Light was his legal widow. They left Texas and moved back to Indian Territory in 1900 to be close to his Apache and Comanche friends. On August 26, 1901, Quanah Parker provided a legal affidavit verifying Lehman's life as his adopted son 1877‚Äì1878. On May 29, 1908, the United States Congress authorized the United States Secretary of the Interior to allot Lehmann, as an adopted member of the Comanche nation, one hundred and sixty acres of Oklahoma land. Lehman chose a site near Grandfield and moved there in 1910. He later deeded some of the property over for a school.Zesch (2004) pp.239‚Äì241 Lehmann died on February 2, 1932, in Loyal Valley, where he is buried next to his mother and stepfather in the cemetery next to the old Loyal Valley one-room school house.

Gianaris supports bail reform and elimination of cash bail. He has introduced a bill which would give judges three options in lieu of cash bail: release on recognizance, conditional monitored release, or remand to a correctional facility. Gianaris introduced legislation to automatically register eligible voters otherwise interacting with state government, something which is already implemented in 14 states and Washington, D.C., including in states such as California, Alaska, and West Virginia. He also has proposed allowing \\"eligible voters to register and cast a ballot on Election Day\\". It would require amending the state constitution.

He played professional football in the National Football League at defensive back for the Baltimore Colts and Buffalo Bills. In college, Kern was the quarterback for the Ohio State Buckeyes from 1968 to 1970; the Buckeyes went undefeated in 1968 and were national champions. Kern was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2007. Early years Born and raised in Lancaster, Ohio, and the son of a barber, Kern was a star three-sport athlete for Lancaster High School and graduated in 1967. In baseball, he was drafted by the Kansas City Athletics, and was offered basketball scholarships to UCLA, North Carolina, and Ohio University. However Kern had long sought to play basketball for Fred Taylor of Ohio State and had fostered a relationship with Taylor that led to a scholarship offer. During the recruiting process, he was also recruited by Woody Hayes and committed to Ohio State to play both sports. College career At Ohio State, Kern quarterbacked the freshman team in 1967, which included 11 high school All-Americans, but suffered a back injury playing freshman basketball. Despite back surgery in June, Kern recovered in time to be named first string quarterback for the varsity football team ahead of senior Bill Long, who had quarterbacked the Buckeyes in 1967. Kern was the leader of the Buckeyes' Super Sophomores, and guided the Buckeyes to an undefeated season and a consensus national championship in 1968. The Super Sophomores finished their three-year varsity careers with a record Kern was a fine passer and a dangerous runner. In the 1968, 1969, and 1970 seasons, he ran for 583, 524, and 597 yards respectively‚Äîhigh numbers for a Big Ten quarterback. The 1968 team shut out top-ranked Purdue on October 12 and went on to an undefeated season, a Big Ten championship, and a berth in the Rose Bowl. Kern was named Most Outstanding Player in the bowl as Ohio State defeated O. J. Simpson and the USC Trojans, and were consensus national champions. In 1969, the Buckeyes were expected to repeat as national champions. Kern directed a high-scoring (averaging 46 points per game) junior- dominated Buckeye offense that cruised through its first eight games. But Kern and the Buckeyes were devastated by a at Michigan, a game in which Kern threw four interceptions. Despite the loss, Ohio State finished as Big Ten co- champions with Michigan and Kern was third in balloting for the 1969 Heisman Trophy. He was also named a first-team All-American. Ohio State did not play in a bowl game, because prior to the 1975 season, the Big Ten and Pac-8 conferences allowed just one bowl team each, to the Rose Bowl. The super sophomores rebounded as seniors in 1970 to win the Big Ten title outright, gaining revenge against Michigan. The Buckeyes finished the regular season undefeated earning another trip to Pasadena. However, they were upset by the led by quarterback Jim Plunkett, the Heisman Trophy winner. Kern, a team captain, finished fifth on the 1970 Heisman ballot. Kern was elected to the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame in 1978, was selected to the Ohio State Football All-Century Team in 2000, and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2007. Professional career Kern was selected in the tenth round of the 1971 NFL Draft by the defending NFL champion Baltimore Colts. Playing cornerback and safety, he played in all fourteen games of his rookie season of 1971, but only five in 1972 after a recurrence of his back injury. Kern recovered to play a full season in 1973, making two interceptions. He was the Colts' National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) representative during the union's strike prior to the 1974 season. After the strike ended, Kern was waived when general manager Joe Thomas acted on his threat to cut players who had walked out. He played eight games with the Buffalo Bills in 1974 before ending his career as an active player due to chronic back problems.Klingaman, Mike. \\"Catching up with...former Colts cornerback Rex Kern,\\" The Baltimore Sun, Friday, November 3, 2017. Personal Kern earned three degrees from Ohio State, a baccalaureate, a master's, and a Ph.D. in education. He credited his success to his education, and his education to Woody Hayes, with whom he had a lifelong friendship. In 2001, he created the Anne and Woody Hayes Endowment for the prevention of child abuse to Columbus Children's Hospital.

Continuing to the east, SH-45 travels eight more miles (12.9 km) from Carrier, before reaching its terminus at US-60/64/81 at the north edge of Enid. History SH-45 was first added to the state highway system between May 1926 and November 1927. The original routing of the highway was from Waynoka to SH-8 in Carmen. Before 1963, the section of present-day SH-45 between SH-58 and SH-132 was part of the original SH-38.

Made by Universal-International, it was produced by Howard Christie. The film's storyline concerns the misadventures of Lester and Orville who accidentally find themselves aboard a rocketship bound for Mars, or so they think. Instead, they wind up landing at the New Orleans Mardi Gras thinking they have landed on the Red Planet. The pair are forced by bank robbers Mugsy and Harry to fly to the planet Venus, where they encounter a civilization consisting entirely of beautiful women. Despite the film's title, no character in the film travels to the planet Mars. Plot Orville (Lou Costello) is the oldest orphan at the Hideaway Orphans Home. He accidentally hides inside a truck heading to a top-secret laboratory. There he is placed under the supervision of lab worker Lester (Bud Abbott) to help load supplies onto an experimental rocket ship. While on board with Lester, Orville hits the ignition button and the rocket ship blasts off, flying across the country and eventually to New Orleans, where Mardi Gras is in progress. Lester and Orville, dressed in their spacesuits, witness the grotesquely costumed celebrants and conclude that they have successfully landed on Mars. Meanwhile, two escaped convicts, Harry the Horse (Jack Kruschen) and Mugsy (Horace McMahon), stumble upon the rocket ship, don another pair of spacesuits and head to New Orleans to rob a bank. Lester and Orville are wrongly accused of the crime and rush back to the rocket ship, where Mugsy and Harry force them to launch into outer space. The rocket ship lands on Venus, where the four men are quickly captured by female guards and brought to Queen Allura (Mari Blanchard). She informs them that Venus is inhabited only by women, as men were banished a long time ago. She takes more than a liking to Orville, however, and decides that he can stay if he is true to her. Orville agrees, and has Harry and Mugsy imprisoned. But Mugsy convinces one of the female guards to flirt with Orville to prove to Queen Allura that he cannot be trusted. Disillusioned with Orville, the Queen orders the men to leave Venus. Upon returning to the Earth, the men are lauded as heroes in a parade, but Allura, who is watching the celebration from Venus, sends a spaceship to Earth that drops a cake on Orville's head.

The cloudbuster was intended to be used in a way similar to a lightning rod: focusing it on a location in the sky and grounding it in some material that was presumed to absorb orgone‚Äîsuch as a body of water‚Äîwould draw the orgone energy out of the atmosphere, causing the formation of clouds and rain. Reich conducted dozens of experiments with the cloudbuster, calling the research \\"Cosmic orgone engineering\\".Sharaf, Myron (1994). Fury on Earth: A Biography of Wilhelm Reich. Da Capo Press (first published by St. Martin's Press, 1983), pp. 379‚àí380. *Also see Remains of the cloudbuster located in alt= Construction A cloudbuster consists of an array of parallel hollow metal tubes which are connected at the rear to a series of flexible metal hoses which are equal or slightly smaller in diameter to the parallel tubes. Alternatively, the rear of the tubes are joined together to a single large diameter pipe and flexible metal hose. The open end of these hoses are placed in water, which Reich believed to be a natural orgone absorber. The pipes can be aimed into areas of the sky to draw energy to the ground like a lightning rod... The remains of one of Reich's cloudbusters can be found in Rangeley, Maine.  In popular culture  Wilhelm Reich's cloudbuster was the inspiration for the 1985 song \\"Cloudbusting\\" by British singer Kate Bush.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6uwLznbW2E The song describes Reich's arrest and incarceration through the eyes of his son, Peter, who later wrote the memoir A Book of Dreams (1973). A cloudbuster, bearing only a superficial resemblance to the genuine article, was designed and built for the video. The video, intended by Bush to be a short narrative film rather than a traditional music video, was conceived by Terry Gilliam and Kate Bush, and directed by Julian Doyle. The video stars actor Donald Sutherland as Reich and Bush as his son, Peter.

She was the first known British trans woman to undergo sex reassignment surgery. Early life Roberta Cowell was born Robert Marshall Cowell, one of three children of Major-General Sir Ernest Marshall Cowell KBE CB (1886‚Äì1971) and Dorothy Elizabeth Miller (1886‚Äì1962). Sir Ernest was a prominent surgeon who served in the Royal Army Medical Corps during the First World War and became a surgeon at Croydon General Infirmary between the wars. During the Second World War, he again served in the army and was the Director of Medical Services for Allied forces in North Africa from 1942 to 1944. In 1944, he was made honorary surgeon to King George VI. Post-war, he was Public Medical Officer for the Allied High Commission (the Allied body that governed occupied Germany after the war). Roberta Cowell attended Whitgift School, a boys' public school in Croydon and was an enthusiastic member of the school's Motor Club, along with John Cunningham, who would later be famous as an RAF night fighter ace and test pilot.Her autobiography does not name her school, but states Cunningham was a fellow pupil. Whitgift was the school he attended. Towards the end of her school days, she visited Belgium, Germany, and Austria with a school friend. At the time, one of her hobbies was photography and film making, and she was briefly arrested in Germany for shooting a cine film of a group of Nazis drilling. She secured her release by agreeing to destroy the film, but was able to substitute unused film stock, and keep the original footage. Cowell left school at the age of 16 to join General Aircraft Limited as an apprentice aircraft engineer, but soon left to join the Royal Air Force, becoming an acting pilot officer on probation on 4 August 1936; Cowell began pilot-training, but was discharged because of air-sickness. In 1936, Cowell began studying engineering at University College London. Also in that year, she began motor-racing, winning her class at the Land's End Speed Trial in a Riley. She gained initial experience of the sport by sneaking into the area where cars were serviced at the Brooklands racing circuit, wearing mechanic's overalls, and offering help to any driver or mechanic who wanted it.Cowell (1952) Chapter 1 By 1939, she owned three cars and had competed in the 1939 Antwerp Grand Prix. Second World War A preserved, photo-reconnaissance Spitfire PR. XI (2008) Hawker Typhoon FR IB, number EK427; this aircraft was flown by 4 Squadron (March 1945) On 28 December 1940, Cowell was commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps as second lieutenant, and in June 1941, married Diana Margaret Zelma Carpenter (1917‚Äì2006), who also had been an engineering student at UCL with an interest in motor racing.Diana Carpenter was the first woman to graduate from UCL with an engineering degree. Cowell served in IcelandIceland was occupied by 25,000 British troops between May 1940 and May 1941, see Iceland during the Second World War before transferring from the Army to the RAF on 24 January 1942 with the rank of pilot officer (temporary). She had obtained a private pilot's licence before the war and completed RAF flying training at RAF Ansty.Cowell (1952) Chapter 2 Cowell served a tour with a front‚Äìline Spitfire squadronUnnamed in her autobiography. and then briefly as an instructor. By June 1944, she was flying with No. 4 Squadron RAF, a squadron assigned to the task of aerial reconnaissance. During the course of the war the squadron had flown a variety of aircraft types but by mid‚Äì1944 it was flying the Spitfire PR. XI, an unarmed, camera-equipped version of the Supermarine Spitfire. Shortly before the D-Day landings, on 4 June 1944, she had a lucky escape when the oxygen system of her Spitfire malfunctioned at over Fruges, France. She passed out but the aircraft continued flying on its own for around an hour over German‚Äìoccupied France while being subjected to German anti-aircraft fire, she regained semi- consciousness at low altitude and was able to fly back to the squadron's base at RAF Gatwick.Yoxoll, p.262 By October 1944, 4 Squadron was based at Deurne, Belgium, on the outskirts of Antwerp. and its Spitfires were supplemented by an allocation of Hawker Typhoon FR IBs, a photo-reconnaissance version of the Hawker Typhoon fighter-bomber.Built in small numbers, the FR IB was intended for photo-reconnaissance at very low level and was intended to complement the Spitfire reconnaissance aircraft, which were operated at high altitude. Unlike the Spitfire, it was armed ‚Äì one of the Typhoon's four cannon was removed and three F24 cameras were fitted in its place, one pointing forwards and two down. However, although the Typhoon was well regarded as a combat aircraft, the reconnaissance version was unpopular with pilots and unsatisfactory in this role ‚Äì inherent engine and airframe vibrations invariably blurred the photographs. On 18 November 1944, Cowell was piloting one of a pair of TyphoonsShe was flying Typhoon number EK429,see: Franks (2000). The other aircraft was flown by Flt. Lt. Draper. on a low-level sortie near Bocholt, Germany.Franks, p.116 South east of Kessel, Cowell attacked targets on the ground, but her aircraft's engine was knocked out and its wing holed by German anti-aircraft fire. Cowell was flying too low to bail-out and instead jettisoned the cockpit canopy and glided her Typhoon to a successful deadstick crash-landing. She was able to contact her companion by radio and confirm she was unhurt before being captured by German troops. Cowell made two escape attempts, reasoning that the chances of success were greatest if the attempt was made quickly, while still close to the front‚Äìline.Cowell (1952) Chapter 4 However, the attempts failed and she was taken further into Germany, spending several weeks in solitary confinement at an interrogation centre for captured Allied aircrew, before being moved to the prisoner‚Äìof‚Äìwar camp Stalag Luft I. Cowell remained a prisoner for around five months, occupying the time by teaching classes in automotive-engineering to fellow inmates. In her biography, she describes the situational sexual behaviour shown by some of the camp's Allied prisoners, and her discomfort at being propositioned by prisoners who assumed she also wanted to take part in this. She was offered the part of a woman in a camp theatrical production but turned it down, as she thought this would make her appear homosexual in the eyes of other prisoners. Towards the end of the war, food became short at the camp; Cowell lost in weight, and later described killing the camp's cats and eating them raw because of hunger.Kennedy p.58 By April 1945, the advancing Red Army was approaching. The initial German intention was to evacuate the camp, but the prisoners refused to leave. After negotiations between the Senior American Officer and the Kommandant, the Germans guarding Stalag Luft I abandoned it and evacuated towards the west, leaving the prisoners behind. The unguarded and undefended camp was reached by the Red Army on the night of 30 April 1945. Commonwealth personnel were flown back to the United Kingdom some two weeks later, between 12 and 14 May, by aircraft of the United States Army Air Forces.Known as Operation Revival, the repatriation of prisoners used American transport aircraft for the sick and wounded, and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers for the healthy. Wooden floor‚Äìboards were installed in the B‚Äì17s' bomb-bays, to make an extemporized passenger compartment and as many as 30 men were crammed into each bomber. Commonwealth ex-prisoners were flown to the United Kingdom, American ex-prisoners were flown to Camp Lucky Strike near Le Havre, France, for return to the United States by sea. The Western Allies were anxious to quickly remove their personnel from areas under Soviet control, for fear they might be used as hostages. See: Howland (2004) Postwar life After demobilization, Cowell was engaged in a number of business ventures until, in 1946, she founded a motor-racing team and competed in events across Europe, including the Brighton Speed Trials and the Grand Prix at Rouen-Les- Essarts. However her autobiography describes this as a time of great distress. She also experienced traumatic flashback when watching the film Mine Own Executioner, in which the hero is shot-down by anti-aircraft fire while flying a Spitfire.Cowell (1952) Chapter 5 In 1948, Cowell separated from her wife and, suffering from depression, she sought out a leading Freudian psychiatrist of the time, but was unsatisfied by the help he offered. Sessions with a second Freudian psychiatrist, described in her biography only as a Scottish man with a less orthodox approach to his profession, gradually revealed, in her own words, that her \\"unconscious mind was predominantly female\\" and \\"feminine side of my nature, which all my life I had known of and severely repressed, was very much more fundamental and deep-rooted than I had supposed.\\" Transition and surgery By 1950, Cowell was taking large doses of oestrogen, but was still living as a man. She had become acquainted with Michael Dillon, a British physician who was the first trans man to get a phalloplasty, after reading his 1946 volume Self: A Study in Endocrinology and Ethics. This work proposed that individuals should have the right to change gender, to have the kind of body they desired.Kennedy p.3 The two developed a close friendship. Dillon subsequently carried out an inguinal orchiectomy on Cowell. Secrecy was necessary for this as the procedure was then illegal in the United Kingdom under so-called \\"mayhem\\" laws and no surgeon would agree to perform it openly. Cowell then presented herself to a private Harley Street gynaecologist and was able to obtain from him a document stating she was intersex. This allowed her to have a new birth certificate issued, with her recorded sex changed to female.Kennedy (2008) p.94 She had a vaginoplasty on 15 May 1951. The operation was carried out by Sir Harold Gillies, widely considered the father of plastic surgery, with the assistance of American surgeon Ralph Millard. Gillies had operated on Michael Dillon, but vaginoplasty was then an entirely novel procedure, which Gillies had only performed experimentally on a cadaver. Later life By 1954, her two business ventures, a racing car engineering company (Leacroft of Egham) and a clothing company had both ceased trading and her change of legal gender had made it impossible for her to continue Grand Prix motor racing. However, in March 1954, news of her gender reassignment broke, gaining public interest around the world. In the United Kingdom, her story was published in the magazine Picture Post, and Cowell received a fee of around ¬£8000 from the magazine (equivalent to ¬£ in , when adjusted for inflation). Cowell's biography was published soon after this, earning a further ¬£1500 (¬£ in ). In the United States, the widespread sensation caused by the news stories about Christine Jorgensen in 1952 had introduced the American public to the concept of changing sex, and the press had continued to print a steady stream of stories about others who had done so, mostly male to female trans women.Meyerowitz p.81 Such reports tended to conflate the unrelated concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity, so transsexuality had become closely associated in the public mind with male homosexuality (during this period, highly taboo) and effeminacy amongst men. Cowell's story consequently appeared confusing as it disrupted this narrative. Her marriage, her parenting of children, her wartime combat service and her association with motor racing were, during this period, perceived as strong markers of heterosexual masculinity; these aspects of her life were described repeatedly in press reports.Meyerowitz p.83 She continued to be active in motor racing and attracted some publicity for winning the 1957 Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb. In November 1958, she acquired an ex-RAF de Havilland Mosquito (number TK-655, civil registration G-AOSS). Her intention was to use the aircraft for a record-breaking flight over the South Atlantic. However, the project fell through due to a lack of suitable engines and in 1958 she became bankrupt with debts totaling ¬£12,580 (approximately ¬£ in ). By 1959, G-AOSS was a derelict hulk and its remains were scrapped in 1960.Thirsk, p.381 Her financial difficulties continued, as she found it difficult to get employment. In later years, she largely dropped out of the public eye. However she was still an active figure in British motor racing in the 1970s.Bouzanquet, p.99 She also continued flying and by this time had logged over 1600 hours as a pilot. A brief interview with Sunday Times journalist Michael Bateman appeared in March 1972, when she was working on an (unpublished) second biography. In the interview, she stated she was an intersex individual with the chromosomal abnormality XX male syndrome, and that the condition justified her transition.XX-male syndrome is sometimes known as de la Chapelle syndrome, for the Finnish researcher who characterized it in, 1972; see de la Chapelle (1972). Those with this condition have a female genotype, but are usually typical boys or men. However, it must be noted that Roberta Cowell stated in her biography she had two children, in July 1942 and August 1944 (see Cowell (1952), chapter 4), and individuals with XX-male syndrome are sterile, due to Azoospermia. Often, they only become aware of their condition when being evaluated for infertility. She also spoke in derogatory terms of those individuals with XY chromosomes who also underwent male to female gender reassignment, saying \\"The people who have followed me have often been those with male chromosomes, XY. So they've been normal people who've turned themselves into freaks by means of the operation.\\" In the 1990s, Cowell moved into sheltered accommodation in Hampton, London although she continued to own and drive large, powerful cars. She died on 11 October 2011. Her funeral was attended by only six people and (on her instructions) was unpublicised ‚Äì her death was not publicly reported until two years later, when a profile of her was printed in The Independent newspaper in October 2013. The New York Times published Cowell's obituary on 5 June 2020.

A BPN extends and implements an organization's Service-orientation in Enterprise Applications. To execute such processes, BPNs combine integration services with application services, often to support a particular industry or process, such as order management, logistics management, automated shipping and receiving, and others. Purpose Most organizations derive their primary value (e.g., revenue) and attain their goals outside of the 'four walls' of the enterprise-‚Äîby selling to consumers (B2C) or to other businesses (B2B). Thus, businesses seek to efficiently manage processes that span multiple organizations. One such process is supply chain management; BPNs are gaining in popularity partly because of the changing nature of supply chains. Supply chains have become truly global. Trends such as global sourcing and offshoring to Asia, India and other low-cost production regions of the world continue to add complexity to effective trading partner management and supply chain visibility. The transition to global sourcing has been challenging for some companies. Few companies have the requisite strategies, infrastructure and extended process control to effectively make the transition to global sourcing. The majority of supply managers continue to use a mix of e-mail, phone and fax to collaborate with offshore suppliers‚Äî-none of which are standardized nor easily integrated to enable informed business decisions and actions. Further, distant trading partners introduce new standards, new systems, multiple time zones, new processes and different levels of technological maturity into the supply chain. Role BPNs help reduce this complexity by providing a common framework for information exchange, visibility and collaboration. BPNs are also increasingly being used to enable and manage operational, business process outsourcing (BPO) functions such as human resources, finance, information technology (IT) and other ‚Äònon-core‚Äô (relative to each business) business functions, whereby the BPN facilitates collaboration and document movement between an organization and its outsourcing firm. Implementation BPNs can be implemented using a host of technology platforms, including but not limited to traditional EDI value-added networks (VANs), industry exchanges, B2B Gateways, point to point integration brokers, VPNs, and other mechanisms that enable trading partners to connect electronically, collaborate and conduct business amongst each other. BPNs are being further accelerated by growth in Web services and service-oriented architectures (SOA), technologies that simplify the integration of people, processes and systems. Business Process Networks are often managed using multi-tenant architectures to more rapidly enable seamless, many-to-many or one-to-many (hub-spoke model) connectivity between trading partners across the extended supply chain. Multi-tenant frameworks also ensure that all trading partners work from a single, shared set of applications and collaboration tools which are hosted by the network provider, mitigating integration barriers and hurdles from heterogeneous back-end IT infrastructures and systems across the trading community. VANs and industry exchanges bring the added benefit of pre-connected trading partners, often ranging in the tens of thousands, that enable faster trading community implementation and lower overall cost to manage and maintain these connections.

She is mostly a companion and sometime girlfriend to Howard the Duck. She was portrayed by Lea Thompson in the 1986 film Howard the Duck. Publication history Switzler first appeared in Howard the Duck #1 (Jan. 1976), before going on to appear alongside Howard in most of his appearances. She did not make very many appearances in comics during the 1980s. Fictional character biography Switzler originally worked as a nude model, until she was hired and subsequently kidnapped by the villain Pro-Rata, and was then rescued by Howard the Duck, prompting her to allow him to live with her.Howard the Duck #1 (Jan. 1976) The pair soon embarked on a road trip to New York City,Howard the Duck #6 (Nov. 1976) where a series of events lead Howard to suffer a mental breakdown and flee from Beverly in a bus.Howard the Duck #9-10 (Feb. - March 1977) However, he is later imprisoned in a mental asylum, causing Beverly and her artist friend Paul Same to rescue him and return him to Cleveland.Howard the Duck #11-14 (April - July 1977) Howard and Beverly later embarked on a cruise ship, where they encountered Beverly's former college classmate Lester Verde, now the supervillain Doctor Bong, who reveals that he has had a crush on her since college and says that she must marry him, otherwise he would kill Howard. She agreed, and they were married by a passing ship captain.Howard the Duck #15-19 (Aug. - Dec. 1977) Beverly did not enjoy being married to him as he was not interested in her and instead was only interested in the Edgar Allan Poe poem \\"The Bells\\". During her forced marriage, she used the resources available in Bong's castle to create five infant clones of Bong, called the Bong Quintuplets, and threatened to reveal that he was a negligent father unless he set her free, which he did.The Sensational She-Hulk #5 (Sept. 1989) The two later spend Thanksgiving at Charles Xavier's Massachusetts Academy, where they encounter the mutants Artie Maddicks, Leech, and Franklin Richards. The kids invite them to their treehouse, where the alien Tana Nile is hiding. They join with the Man-Thing, who assists them from fleeing the murderous Black Tom Cassidy. As a result, the entire group go through many adventures together.Generation X #25 (March 1997) Beverly, who was working as a video store clerk in Cleveland at this time, gets Howard a job as a department store Santa.The Howard the Duck Holiday Special #1 (Feb. 1997) Out of work Later Howard and Beverly find themselves unemployed and living in a shack in the middle of a garbage dump. Beverly decides to look for work and is hired by a company called Globally Branded Content to be a supervisor for a boy-band singer. She is surprised, however, to learn that her salary will be an unusually high $125,000 a year. She eventually learns that this is because the head of the company is Doctor Bong, who reveals that he still has feelings towards her. Howard also learns that Bong is the head of the company and attempts to rescue Beverly, only for Bong to throw him into a vat of chemicals, with the intention of killing him. Howard survives however, but his DNA is altered causing him to transform into a series of animals. Howard and Beverly then go home, only for Bong to repeatedly phone them and ask Beverly to continue her romantic affair with him. Upon learning that Beverly feels nothing towards him but hate, he tries to have her killed by informing the US Military Howard is an Al Quida terrorist by the name of Osama el-Braka, and that Beverly is his accomplice. The military then destroy their home and were going to kill Howard and Beverly, but since Howard was a mouse and not a duck at the time, they decide they must have gone to the wrong address. Seeing as they are now homeless, Howard, Beverly and their pet pit bull terrier try to search for a hotel to stay in, but are rejected by most because they have no ID, no address, and because the hotels does not allow dogs or rodents. They were then arrested by police officers and Beverly's former classmate, Suzi Pazuzu, for disturbing the peace. When interrogating them, she does believe either of their accounts, although they both manage to escape from police custody. Meanwhile, Doctor Bong hires an assassin to kill Howard and Beverly, but the assassin only agrees if Bong will bring him a bracelet which contains the power of the doucheblade, which will grant a female wearer superpowers. Although the assassin is male, he states that he is undergoing hormone treatment so that he can become a woman and wield the doucheblade. Bong learns that the doucheblade is in possession of detective Pazuzu, so he and the assassin's son travel there to kill her and steal the doucheblade, although Beverly and Howard also learn this and travel to her home to protect her. A confrontation then ensures which ends with the bracelet landing in Howard's wrist, causing him to transform into a woman and possess the doucheblade's powers. He then kills the assassin's son and was preparing to kill Bong when Beverly intervenes and tells Howard to stop, but tells Bong that if he ever interferes with her life again she will kill him. Bong accepts that the two no longer have feelings for one another and he leaves. Beverly and Doctor Bong have not encountered each other since. Howard and Beverly then leave Pazuzu with the body of the assassin's son in her home, so that she can be framed for killing him, in order to get revenge on her for arresting them.Howard the Duck (vol. 2) #1-3 (March - May 2002) Boarding house Again homeless, Beverly discovers a flyer advertising a shelter called the Boarding House of Mystery which will accept pit bulls. They go to the shelter and are surprised to be told by its owner, Cain, that they do not have to pay and that fate had made them find the flyer. While staying in the shelter they encounter a journalist who offers to let them be his two new assistants and attempts to get them to guest star on the television series Iprah (a parody of Oprah). However, this ends with a demon attacking the studio and attempting to kill Howard and Beverly, before Howard manages to kill it with a magic cigar.Howard the Duck (vol. 2) #4-5 (June - July 2002) Civil War During the Civil War event, Howard and Beverly attempt to register under the Superhuman Registration Act, with Howard posing as a superhero and Beverly as his sidekick, because Beverly states that they could use the money paid to registered heroes. However, they are unable to register due to Howard's disruptive nature; S.H.I.E.L.D. created a policy that he does not legally exist, as it saves \\"time and money\\".Civil War: Choosing Sides #1 After the Civil War, Beverly helped Howard to stop the villain M.O.D.O.T.'s scheme to control the public through mass media.Howard the Duck (vol. 3) #1-4 Beverly appeared in a one-panel cameo in New Avengers #7 (cover date Feb. 2011). She was one of the many applicants for nanny to Luke Cage and Jessica Jones' daughter, Danielle. Howard the Duck (vol. 6) Beverly would leave Howard again as she feared for his life. She moved to Maine where she began studying to be a veterinarian. Suddenly, Howard showed up on her doorstep and the two had a bittersweet reunion. She revealed that she was willing to return to him as soon as she finished her studies.Howard the Duck (Vol. 6) #8 (Aug. 2016) Thanks to the Sparkitects, Howard had them slightly alter reality in Beverly's favor so that when she graduated she could successfully open her own veterinary clinic, Scales & Tales.Howard the Duck (Vol. 6) #11 (Dec. 2016) Powers and abilities Switzler initially possessed no superhuman abilities, although Howard does jokingly say that she can turn men into ducks to prevent people flirting with her, and that another of her powers is that she can make her breasts move in opposite directions, although she must be drunk in order to do this. In Howard the Duck (Vol. 6) #8, Switzler is revealed to have gained the ability to fly after having been coated in some unknown pink residue from an earlier adventure. It's unknown to what extent she can fly or what other powers she possesses as she refrains from using them in order to live a normal life. In other media Switzler appears in the poorly received 1986 film adaptation Howard the Duck, played by Lea Thompson, although this version differs from the comic incarnation of the character as she is a singer. While the film is considered a box office bomb, Thompson's performance was mostly praised. Switzler's fictional band in the film, Cherry Bomb, released several songs on the film's soundtrack produced by Thomas Dolby featuring the film's theme song and other material. Thompson, as Beverly, sang lead vocals on the release.

The mall opened on August 16, 2016 as the largest shopping complex in Manhattan, with 125 retail spaces. It replaces the Mall at the World Trade Center, the underground shopping mall under the original World Trade Center, which was destroyed on September 11, 2001.  Original mall (1975‚Äì2001) Map of the original mall prior to its destruction on September 11, 2001. The Mall at the World Trade Center was an indoor underground shopping mall that was located in the concourse area of the original World Trade Center complex. Most of the mall was located underneath 4 and 5 World Trade Center, as well as under the Austin J. Tobin Plaza. Completed in 1975, it was the largest shopping mall in New York City, and was managed by the Westfield Group. The main entrance was located on the south side of 4 World Trade Center facing Liberty Street with escalators going down into the concourse. The other entrance was located on the east side of 5 World Trade Center facing Church Street. The mall was also accessible from the lobbies of the Twin Towers, and it served as the point of access or transfer to the Chambers Street‚ÄìWorld Trade Center subway station on the . PATH trains intersected in the basement levels, which were located under the mall. The mall included eateries as well as approximately 80 stores, including Duane Reade, Gap, Sam Goody, Victoria's Secret, and the Warner Bros. Studio Store. Thousands of people traveled through the mall daily. In August 2001, the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey leased the mall to the Westfield Group. After the purchase, Westfield was planning a massive renovation and expansion of the mall, and was going to rename it Westfield Shoppingtown World Trade Center in 2002. September 11 attacks A commonly reported story of eyewitnesses inside the mall at 8:46 a.m. EDT, when American Airlines Flight 11 struck the North Tower, is of fireballs fed by flaming jet fuel shooting down the elevator shafts and bursting out of the elevators inside the lobby, with many of the fireballs reaching as far as the mall itself. As stated in the 9/11 Commission Report: > The Port Authority's on-site commanding police officer was standing in the > concourse when a fireball exploded out of the North Tower lobby, causing him > to dive for cover. Survivor Allison Summers described the conditions in the mall right after the terrorist attack: > I had almost reached the [Cortlandt Street] Uptown 1 and 9 station when > there was an enormous explosion. The building shook. I heard people say, > 'Oh, no.' Some, not many, were screaming. ... I looked ahead past Banana > Republic, past Citibank to the plaza outside. At that moment, there was a > terrifying tidal wave of smoke filling the doorway. It began to shoot > forward. The smoke had this enormous momentum that started to come towards > us, as if it had a will of its own. We ran. We ran together past the Coach > store. We ran to get out of the path of this enormous wave of smoke. It was > like we were being chased. All the people on the concourse ran. We turned > right, heading toward the PATH trains. As we ran, shop assistants were > calling in doorways, 'What happened? What happened?' But we were running so > fast we couldn't answer them and they ran with us. Some people were crying; > some people were screaming. We moved as one body. No one pushed and no one > shoved. We all had the same intention: to get out of the building. Shortly after the first impact, water began spraying into the mall from broken pipes or activated sprinkler systems. As Erik Ronningen describes: > I drag my body down through the decimated main lobby [of the North Tower], > through a waterfall from the Mall ceiling, and wade the darkened Mall > corridor through 75 yards [69 m] of ankle-deep water to Tower Two.\\" The mall itself played an important role during the attacks because the people who were evacuating the Twin Towers could not exit outside onto the plaza because of falling debris, so they traveled through the mall, and exited through either 4 or 5 World Trade Center.  Current mall (2016‚Äìpresent)  Westfield World Trade Center has roughly of retail space. Although the new mall is only spread over roughly one-half of the original mall's footprint (due to the new space required for the below-grade National September 11 Memorial & Museum), the mall is double-level, whereas the original mall was a single level. Three additional levels will exist above-grade on the lower floors of 2 and 3 World Trade Center, while 4 World Trade Center currently houses four above-grade levels. The World Trade Center station's head house, the Oculus, also houses a large amount of retail space. According to developer Larry Silverstein, whose firm Silverstein Properties was replaced by Westfield Corporation as the developer: Construction on the One World Trade Center portion of the mall began in 2007. In February 2012, Westfield Corporation entered an agreement with the Port Authority, which owns the rest of the World Trade Center site, to jointly own and manage the mall. At the same time, Westfield began marketing space in the mall and opened a leasing office in 7 World Trade Center. In December 2013, the Port Authority sold its remaining stake in the retail development to Westfield. This also brings retail at the World Trade Center to Westfield's complete control. The mall was 80% leased . The mall's 125 retail spaces were fully leased by October 2015. The mall opened on August 16, 2016, with a concert headlined by John Legend and Leslie Odom Jr., the opening of a food court and stores such as Pandora and Apple. In total, there were 60 stores in the mall when it opened. By 2017, there were 82 stores within the mall, although much of the mall's space had not been leased. Some tenants were also moving out, and the Port Authority was also rebuilding nine storefronts in front of the PATH station's entrance. These nine storefronts, which were considered prime retail space, were not available because that location had been the site of the former entrance to the temporary PATH station.

It was a large format publication, with color covers on card stock and black & white interiors. Charton Bullseye published several previously unpublished Charlton superhero and adventure stories, along with articles on Charlton comics, news, reviews, pinups, and more. History The CPL Gang was a group of comics enthusiasts who published the fanzine Contemporary Pictorial Literature (CPL) in the mid-1970s. Founded by Roger Stern and Bob Layton, the CPL Gang included Roger Slifer, Duffy Vohland, and the young John Byrne, all of whom themselves became comics professionals by the tail-end of the 1970s. CPL rapidly became a popular fan publication, and led to the CPL Gang forming an alliance with Charlton. During the mid-1970s, both Marvel Comics and DC Comics were publishing in-house \\"fan\\" publications (F.O.O.M. and The Amazing World of DC Comics respectively), and Charlton wished to make inroads into the superhero market, as well as \\"establish a fan presence.\\" The CPL Gang first got permission to publish a one-shot called Charlton Portfolio (actually CPL #9/10) in 1974 which included the unpublished sixth issue of Blue Beetle vol. 5 (1967 series). The positive response to Charlton Portfolio led to the CPL Gang getting approval to publish a Charlton- focused fanzine, Charlton Bullseye. This in turn led to Charlton giving Layton and Stern \\"access to unpublished material from their vaults by the likes of Steve Ditko, Jeff Jones and a host of others.\\" Much of this material made it into the five issues of Charlton Bullseye.

MicroIllusions, as a company, was a strong supporter of the Commodore Amiga and typically released titles on that platform before porting it to others. Activision cancelled them as an affiliated publisher after a year of signing them up. The company went out of business in or about 1990. General The company impact has been summed up as, \\"During MicroIllusion‚Äôs brief existence they produced some visionary software that, like so much else that came out of the Amiga scene, gave the world an imperfect glimpse of its multimedia future. That‚Äôs as true of Photon Paint, the progenitor of photographic-quality visual editors like Adobe Photoshop, as it is of Music-X, a forerunner of easy-to-use music packages like GarageBand.\\" Founding According to The Digital Antiquarian, \\"The seeds of MicroIllusions were planted during one day‚Äôs idle conversation when Steinert complained to David Joiner that, while the Amiga supposedly had speech synthesis built into its operating system, he had never actually heard his machines talk; .. He proved as good as his word within a few hours. Impressed, Steinert asked if he could sell the new program ' talk to me' in his store for a straight 50/50 split. Given his circumstances, Joiner was hardly in a position to quibble. When the program sold well, Steinert decided to get into Amiga software development in earnest with the help of his wunderkind.\\" Applications *Photon Paint 1.0 (2D painting with 3D generation) (1987) Amiga *Photon Video: Cel Animator (animation) (1988) Amiga *Transport Controller (animation) (1988) Amiga *Photon Paint 2.0 (2D painting with 3D generation) (1989) Amiga / Mac *Edit Decision List Processor (film/video production) (1989) Amiga *Genesis: The Third Day (3D landscape generation) (1991) Amiga *Music-X (1989) David Joiner (Talin) *Music-X Jr *Dynamic CAD 2.3 *Dynamic Word *The Planetarium *Micro Midi *Dynamic Publisher Games * Discovery (1986), Amiga, DOS, C64, Megadrive (Genesis) created by David Joiner (Talin).

The mall is managed and co-owned by Simon Property Group, and is adjacent to Interstate 680. The mall is anchored by JCPenney and two Macy's stores - a women's store, and a men's, children's, and home store. Two standalone restaurants - The Cheesecake Factory and P. F. Chang's China Bistro - sit adjacent to the mall. History The mall opened in 1980 and is part of the larger Stoneridge master planned neighborhood originally developed by Stoneson Development Corporation, whose founders also developed Lakeside Village and Stonestown Galleria in nearby San Francisco after World War II. The mall itself was developed by A. Alfred Taubman, who also developed several other shopping malls in the Bay Area, including Eastridge Mall in San Jose, Hilltop Mall in Richmond and Sunvalley Mall in Concord. The original anchor tenants were Macy's, Emporium-Capwell, and JCPenney. Nordstrom opened a store in 1990, the same year Emporium-Capwell dropped the double-barrelled name and became simply Emporium. Six years later, Emporium was acquired by the parent company of Macy's, which elected to keep both locations; the original Macy's store was used for their women's departments and their men's and home furnishings departments were relocated to the former Emporium store. 1996 also saw the construction and opening of a Sears store. Ownership of Stoneridge was to change in the next few years as the Taubman shopping center interests, which had become a publicly traded real estate investment trust in 1992, were reorganized in 1998 and the GM Pension Trust assumed full ownership of Stoneridge, retaining Taubman Centers as manager. In 2004 the GM Pension Trust sold a half interest in a portfolio of shopping centers, including Stoneridge, to The Mills Corporation, which also assumed management of the center. A joint venture led by Simon Property Group purchased The Mills Corp. in 2007, bringing Stoneridge under the Simon banner. Plans to renovate and expand the property were announced in 2005, calling for the construction of a new, smaller Nordstrom store and the addition of new shops, restaurants, and a cinema within the existing Nordstrom building's footprint. The only portion of the plans to materialize were the addition of two restaurants outside the mall - The Cheesecake Factory and P. F. Chang's China Bistro, both of which opened in 2006. On October 15, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 142 stores nationwide. The department store shuttered in January 2019, paving the way for a planned redevelopment. On May 7, 2020, it was announced that Nordstrom would not be reopening its store at Stoneridge as part of a plan to close 16 locations due to declining sales. This will leave JCPenney and Macy's as the only anchors left.

Baraka also recorded a version of the play with Sun Ra's Myth-Science Orchestra in 1968.Discogs The play is based on the religious doctrine of Yakub as taught by the Nation of Islam, and it describes the origin of white people according to this doctrine. A Black Mass, written at the beginning of Baraka's involvement in black nationalism and the Black Arts Movement, was a turning point in the artist's career. Conceived as a form of \\"action literature\\", the play aimed to raise the political consciousness of Black Americans. Baraka had learned of the Yakub myth from Malcolm X, whose assassination in 1965 likely provided further inspiration for the work.Collins & Crawford 2006, p. 144. This play is a visceral experience through the use of music and lighting, beginning in a \\"Jet blackness\\" accompanied with the \\"Music of eternal concentration and wisdom\\" composed by Sun Ra, which represent a prelapsarian state of non-threatening darkness.\\"This 'black endless space' is not threatening but perceived by the black magicians as 'beautiful reality'.\\" Elam 2001, p. 53. Baraka inverts the idea that white symbolizes goodness and black symbolizes wickedness, so that the images of beauty and life are associated with blackness. As Jacoub, the protagonist of the play, creates the \\"White Beast\\" that will become the ancestor to the white race, this peaceful blackness is soon contrasted with scenes of pandemonium, in which the room is filled with unsettling melodies and the sounds of banging and screeching (provided in the original production by Sun Ra's Myth Science Arkestra).Collins & Crawford 2006, p. 144. To add to the audience's unease, the actors are not confined to the stage: the \\"Beast\\" leaps among the spectators, screaming \\"White! White! White!\\" and \\"Me! Me! Me!\\". The play ends on a call to arms against this newly created affront against nature: > \\"And so Brothers and Sisters, these beasts are still loose in the world. > Still, they spit their hideous cries. There are beasts in our world, > Brothers and Sisters. There are beasts in our world. Let us find them and > slay them. Let us lock them in their caves. Let us declare the holy war. The > Jihad. Or we cannot deserve to live. Izm-el-Azam. Izm-el-Azam. Izm-el-Azam.\\" The final statement, which means \\"May God have mercy,\\" is repeated continuously until the lights go dark.

He forfeited his seat in the Assembly on March 6, 2014 due to his conviction on numerous federal felony charges related to extortion, bribery, and official corruption. Chosen to represent his district in a special election held in 2003, he served as a member of several standing committees in the lower legislative body of the New York State Legislature, including the Committee on Aging, the Committee on Cities, the Committee on Economic Development, and the Committee on Job Creation, among others. Biography Boyland came from a family of Brooklyn politicians. His father, William F. Boyland, occupied a seat in the New York State Assembly for two decades, while his uncle, Thomas S. Boyland, was a member of the Assembly from 1977 to 1982. His sister, Tracy L. Boyland, was the Chairwoman of the Women's Issues Committee on the New York City Council. His wife Kamaria Alfattan was the district leader of Bedstuy. On December 20, 2002 he had a son William Boyland 3 Prior to his election to the Assembly, Boyland served as an intern in the offices of several United States Congressmen, including those of fellow Brooklynites Edolphus Towns and Major Owens. Corruption On March 10, 2011, Boyland was among eight individuals, including Carl Kruger, another New York State Assemblyman, who surrendered to face charges in a federal corruption case accusing the lawmakers of taking bribes over the course of a decade. On November 10, 2011, Boyland was acquitted of those charges. However, before the end of the month, he was arrested again on separate federal bribery charges, with prosecutors claiming to have secretly recorded him soliciting $250,000 in bribes even while the first set of charges were still unresolved. His chief of staff, Ry- Ann Hermon, was also arrested on related charges, and eventually pleaded guilty. Boyland was charged with three additional counts of mail fraud on March 18, 2013 for falsely securing tens of thousands of dollars in travel reimbursements, and several weeks later another fraud charge was added for steering taxpayer money to a nonprofit agency and directing that agency to reimburse him for other expenses. On May 14, 2013, Boyland pleaded not guilty. The second trial ended in his conviction on all 21 felony counts he faced, including extortion, bribery, and mail fraud (Eastern District of New York, docket no. 11-CR-850). Upon conviction, Boyland immediately lost his seat in the Assembly. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison, taken into custody at his sentencing, and ordered to pay more than $155,000 in public money he was determined to have misused or stolen. As of August 2016, he was serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Loretto, a low- security federal prison in Western Pennsylvania. Of the numerous New York politicians convicted of various forms of official corruption in recent years, Boyland's sentence is the longest to date, topping former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's second-place 12 year sentence.

He is known for roles in the 2007 Academy Award-winning film The Lives of Others, in Steven Spielberg's Bridge of Spies, and as Otto D√ºring in the fifth season of the Showtime series Homeland. Childhood Koch grew up in Stuttgart with his single mother. He originally wanted to be a musician, but a production of the artistic director Claus Peymann influenced him in the late 1970s to change his career aspiration to become an actor. Career Theatre From 1982 to 1985, Koch studied at the renowned Otto Falckenberg School in Munich. In addition to his cinematic work, he played a diversity of different roles on stage. Koch portrayed amongst other Peer Gynt and Leonce in Leonce and Lena at the municipal theatre of Darmstadt. At the Schiller theatre in Berlin he played the character Roller in Schiller's The Robbers and Orest in Goethe's Iphigenie auf Tauris. A couple of years later, he took over the role of Lord Goring in Oscar Wilde's An Ideal Husband in the playhouse Bochum under the direction of Armin Holz. Film and television Koch had his first TV appearance in 1980 in the 77th episode of the series Derrick, followed by an episode in the popular crime series Tatort in 1986. He acted in numerous thrillers like Der Mann mit der Maske, Die brennende Schnecke, and in 1997 in Heinrich Breloer's two-piece ', in which he portrayed the role of Andreas Baader. For the title role in ' and for his performance as the writer Klaus Mann in Heinrich Breloer‚Äôs docudrama The Manns ‚Äì A Novel of the Century, he won respectively in 2002 the Adolf Grimme Award, one the most prestigious awards for German television. The latter was furthermore distinguished as \\"TV event of the year\\" with the German Television Award. In addition, Koch received the Bavarian TV Award for the same movie. His first international productions included the historical drama Napoleon, which Koch in appeared alongside G√©rard Depardieu, John Malkovich and Isabella Rossellini and brought him more attention. He portrayed the youthful lover of Catherine Deneuve, Rodolphe L√∂wenstein, in Marie und Freud. Koch has portrayed historically significant personalities, among Rudolf H√∂ss in Costa-Gavras Hochhuth's adaptation Amen (Der Stellvertreter). He appeared in The Tunnel, a made-for- television German film about the idea of going underground by digging a tunnel shortly after the construction of the Berlin wall in 1961, and in Peter Keglevic‚Äôs historical drama Two Days of Hope about the uprising on 17 June 1953. Koch appeared in Stauffenberg (2004 by Jo Baier and winner of the German Film Award); and he played Albert Speer in Heinrich Breoler's mini-series Speer und Er in 2004 - his third collaboration with the director following Todesspiel and The Manns ‚Äì A Novel of the Century. He received for his performance as the Nazi architect Albert Speer the German TV Award. Sebastian Koch appeared in Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's drama The Lives of Others in 2006 as one of the leading roles. He portrayed the playwright Georg Dreyman, who lived in East Germany with his lover, a dissident who was spied on and monitored. The movie received an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 2007 as well as the BAFTA Award, the C√©sar, and the German and European Film Award. Koch himself was nominated several times for his work in The Lives of Others and received the Globo d'oro for Best European Actor, The Quadriga, and the Bambi. Paul Verhoeven's movie Black Book (Zwartboek) was also shot in 2006. Koch played a Nazi Officer in occupied Holland who falls in love with a Jewish member of the resistance (Carice van Houten). Black Book celebrated its premiere at the Venice Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival. After shooting the movie ' in 2007/2008, Koch appeared on camera for the international production of Jack London's classic psychological adventure novel Sea Wolf, where Koch portrayed a lone despot of both brutal cruelty and longing romance. The shooting of this two-parter based on Nigel Williams‚Äô script and under Mike Barker‚Äôs direction took place in Halifax, Canada. The mini-series won the Directors Guild of Canada Award and Koch was nominated in 2010 for his role as Wolf Larsen for the international Emmy Award. The shooting of the movie Manipulation (adapted from the novel Das Verh√∂r des Harry Wind) took also place in 2008, with Koch and Klaus Maria Brandauer playing leading roles. In 2010, Koch was the male title role in the English independent tragicomedy Albatross under the direction of Niall MacCormick. He played the role of Prof. Bressler in the movie Unknown (with Liam Neeson and Diane Kruger) under the direction of Jaume Collet-Serra. In the summer of 2010, he took a guest role alongside Eva Green and Joseph Fiennes in the TV series Camelot from the Irish RT Film production, followed by the UFA production Bella Block - Stich ins Herz under the direction of Stephan Wagner, in which Koch played the role of Max Kl√∂ckner. As a host of the ZDF production Terra X, Koch presented the Cologne Cathedral, the Neuschwanstein Castle and the Dresden Frauenkirche. In 2011, Koch appeared in the Czech production The Shadow of the Horse (Ve Stinu), in which Koch played the leading role of the investigator Zenk, whose mission is to win through one personal rival and through the regime of communist Prague in the 50s. In the German production adapted from Bernhard Schlink's novel Das Wochenende in 2012, Koch portrays an amnestied RAF terrorist (Jens Kessler), who has a reunion with his old mates. In the same year, Koch began shooting the Greek-Russian drama film God Loves Caviar based upon the true story of Ioannis Varvakis, played by Koch, a former pirate who moved up to being a Greek caviar merchant and eventual benefactor from Psara. The international cast also included Catherine Deneuve as Catherine the Great of Russia and John Cleese as Officer McCormick. Furthermore, Koch played the title role in Suspension of Disbelief, a thriller by Mike Figgis, which was followed by part 5 of the Die Hard movies, with Koch as Bruce Willis' antagonist. In 2013, Ridley Scott (director and producer) began working on The Vatican, a pilot episode for a Showtime series about intrigues concerning the Pope and mysteries and secrets within the Catholic Church. Koch played the role of the Vatican's secretary Cardinal Marco Malerba, who is one of the true potentates of the inner circle.

The cast furthermore includes Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander. Subsequently, Koch filmed Fog in August (by director Kai Wessel), the first feature film to address the Nazis' euthanasia program and the hospital's staunch Nazi chief physician Werner Veithausen's (played by Koch) way of dealing with the issue. Eventually, in 2015, Koch began shooting the fifth season of the Showtime series Homeland about bipolar CIA Officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes). After leaving the CIA, Carrie now works for German billionaire Otto D√ºring (Koch), a philanthropist who uses the money his family made through affiliation with the Nazis to help struggling people around the world, including in volatile regions of the Middle East. D√ºring hires her to be his head of security in Berlin. Audiobooks Koch has frequently served as an interpreter of both literary and musical-literary audiobooks and live performances of such. Current projects include Schumann - Scenes of a marriage (with Martina Gedeck) about the exchange of letters between Clara and Robert Schumann, and accompanied by Argentinean bandoneon virtuoso Roberto Russo Koch has also presented excerpts from The Player by Dostoyevsky. The premiere of a play reading of Rhapsody: A Dream Novel by Arthur Schnitzler - accompanied by compositions especially for jazz - took place at the Literature and Poetry Festival in Bad Homburg in 2011. In 2012, he produced the audiobook Koch is reading Heuss about speeches and letters by Theodor Heuss in collaboration with Cherbuliez Productions. Koch twice lent his voice to the audiobook edition of Brigitte - Strong Voices. In 2007, he recorded the novel A perfect friend (Martin Suter) followed by the crime story On the twelfth day (Wolfgang Schorlau) in 2014. Personal life He dated Carice van Houten from 2006‚Äì2009.

The first, mainly in the United States, refers to automobile safety systems that help avoid accidents, such as good steering and brakes. In this context, passive safety refers to features that help reduce the effects of an accident, such as seat belts, airbags and strong body structures. This use is essentially interchangeable with the terms primary and secondary safety that tend to be used worldwide in standard UK English. The correct ISO term is \\"primary safety\\" (ISO 12353-1). However, active safety is increasingly being used to describe systems that use an understanding of the state of the vehicle to both avoid and minimise the effects of a crash. These include braking systems, like brake assist, traction control systems and electronic stability control systems, that interpret signals from various sensors to help the driver control the vehicle. Additionally, forward-looking, sensor-based systems such as advanced driver-assistance systems including adaptive cruise control and collision warning/avoidance/mitigation systems are also considered as active safety systems under this definition. These forward-looking technologies are expected to play an increasing role in collision avoidance and mitigation in the future. Most major component suppliers, such as Aptiv, TRW and Bosch, are developing such systems. However, as they become more sophisticated, questions will need to be addressed regarding driver autonomy and at what point these systems should intervene if they believe a crash is likely. In engineering, active safety systems are systems activated in response to a safety problem or abnormal event. Such systems may be activated by a human operator, automatically by a computer driven system, or even mechanically. In nuclear engineering, active safety contrasts to passive safety in that it relies on operator or computer automated intervention, whereas passive safety systems rely on the laws of nature to make the reactor respond to dangerous events in a favourable manner. Examples *The computer operated control rods in a nuclear power station provide an active safety system, whereas a fuel that produces less heat at abnormally high temperatures constitutes a passive safety feature *Collision avoidance systems in a modern car *Many buildings have interconnected fire alarms that can be triggered manually by pushing a button or breaking a glass plate attached to sensors Automotive sector In the automotive sector the term active safety (or primary safety) refers to safety systems that are active prior to an accident. This has traditionally referred to non-complex systems such as good visibility from the vehicle and low interior noise levels. Nowadays, however, this area contains highly advanced systems such as anti-lock braking system, electronic stability control and collision warning/avoidance through automatic braking. This compares with passive safety (or secondary safety), which are active during an accident. To this category belong seat belts, deformation zones and air-bags, etc. Advancement in passive safety systems has progressed very far over the years, and the automotive industry has shifted its attention to active safety where there are still a lot of new unexplored areas. Research today focuses primarily on collision avoidance (with other vehicles, pedestrians and wild animals)https://www.youtube.com/user/VolvoCarsNews#p/u/14/DGUuNZbAVgs and vehicle platooning.https://www.youtube.com/user/VolvoCarsNews#p/u/51/45IRE8W_3L8  Examples of active safety  *Good visibility from driver's seat, *Low noise level in interior, *Legibility of instrumentation and warning symbols, *Early warning of severe braking ahead, *Head up displays, *Good chassis balance and handling, *Good grip, *Anti-lock braking system, *Electronic Stability Control, *Chassis assist, *Intelligent speed adaptation, *Brake assist, *Traction control, *Collision warning/avoidance, *Adaptive or autonomous cruise control system. *Electronic brakeforce distribution  Examples of passive safety  Front structure of a Renault Sc√©nic showing crumple zones. *Passenger safety cell, *Crumple zones, *Seat belts, *Loadspace barrier-nets, *Air bags, *Laminated glass, *Correctly positioned fuel tanks, *Fuel pump kill switches See also * Passively safe * Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) * Electronic Stability Control References External links *Continental Automotive Systems *TRW Cognitive Safety Systems *SafelyThere - Continental Automotive Systems *Vehicle Safety Equipment \\"Drive Safer America\\" Category:Safety engineering Category:Nuclear safety and security Category:Vehicle safety technologies ","title":"Active safety"},{"id":"7068605","text":"Robots is a platform video game released in 2005. The game was developed by Eurocom and published by Vivendi Universal Games to coincide with the film of the same name. Summary Non DS/GBA Plot: A robot named Rodney Copperbottom decides to leave his home at Rivet Town and head to Robot City to realize his dream of working for his childhood hero, Bigweld. He makes a flying robot called Wonderbot out of scrap before he leaves. At the city, he goes to Bigweld's factory, but realizes that Bigweld is mysteriously absent, and finds out that the factory is currently being run by a robot by the name of Phineas T. Ratchet, who hatches an evil plan to create more futuristic robots like himself and destroying old robots made out of scrap. Rodney also meets a gang of colorful outmodes called the Rusties, who are also affected from the change Ratchet has made. A robot named Jack Hammer tells Rodney that there are many scrap parts in the sewers of Robot City and that Rodney can go collect the scrap in order to keep the Rusties alive. After doing so, Rodney and the Rusties go to Bigweld's Mansion to find Bigweld. Bigweld agrees to help Rodney and the Rusties, and sets off with Rodney to stop Ratchet and save all robot- kind. DS/GBA Plot: The DS/GBA plot is basically the same, though the open ended nature of the world means there are a few more diversions. You begin in a Train Station having left Rivet City as Rodney Copperbottom, and after a brief jaunt through the city you approach Bigweld's Factory, but are told they no longer seek inventors. You sneak into the place and accidentally interrupt a meeting held by Phineas T. Ratchet, who immediately kicks you out. After being tossed into the underground, Rodney explores and comes across a group of outmodes collectively named the Rusties. They mention that Bigweld has been gone for a long time, and that Ratchet seems to be wanting to destroy them for unknown reasons. Rodney assists a robot named Jack Hammer with a favor, and he informs the player that there's a party going on in the northern part of the map. Rodney ventures there, has a scuffle with Ratchet, and travels to Bigweld's Mansion. You find the old robot, who initially thinks your cause is lost, but decides to assist Rodney anyhow. He returns to his factory with you in tow, and you come across him being attacked by Ratchet. Rodney escapes by riding Bigweld in another boss fight until he falls into Madame Gasket's lair. You follow quickly and eventually fight the old robot herself, finally putting an end to the tyranny that has been plaguing the city Voice cast *Jess Harnell - Rodney Copperbottom *Jansen Panettiere - Young Rodney Copperbottom, additional voices *Stanley Tucci - Herb Copperbottom *Dee Bradley Baker - Tim, Electroblast inventor, chop shop guard, additional voices *Alan Rosenberg - Jack Hammer *Michael Gough - Bigweld, additional voices *Jim Meskimen - Phineas T. Ratchet *Grey DeLisle - Cappy *Harland Williams - Lugnut *Kath Soucie - Piper Pinwheeler *Jennifer Coolidge - Aunt Fanny *Frank Welker - Wonderbot Gameplay This game features Rodney Copperbottom as the playable main character. The player can also play as the Wonderbot in certain areas, and Bigweld in the chase scene. Rodney can invent different devices by collecting a certain amount of blueprints scattered throughout the environment. In the beginning of the game, he repairs his Wonderbot, his personal companion. He also obtains the Scrap Launcher from Herb Copperbottom, a weapon which uses Scrap as ammo which is found in the worlds of the game, and a wrench which is used as a melee weapon. More weapons are acquired throughout the course of the game. Scrap is also used to purchase items at vendors, including the Maxi-Scrap 500 and Maxi-Scrap 1000 which upgrades his Scrap capacity from 200 to 500 and 1000 respectively, the Refine-O-Max which doubles the value of Scrap, and four mutually exclusive upgrades to his Scrap Launcher which can be replaced at any time. Later while in Robot City he obtains the Magnabeam from Jack Hammer, which uses energy which must be refilled by going on recharge circles, and can also be used as a weapon. The GBA game functions as more of a Metroidvania-style game, where Rodney has to platform and fight enemies across a sizable world map, collecting upgrades by beating bosses and finding parts scattered across the city for different robots also scattered across the city. The weapons you gain open new areas of the map. There are a handful of small minigames as well, from a game where you toss oil cans at customers to surviving a torrent of dominos. The fast travel system, taken from the film's transit system, also has a small mini-game where you can collect extra ammunition for weapons. The scrap launcher remains from the console ports, though you obtain it through delivering an item in the first area rather than getting it from one of the movie characters. The Magnet Bomb attracts enemies closer to it and hits certain switches, and an Electric weapon that does the most damage and hits certain switches. Upgrades can be found for each that allow them to do more damage and have a longer range. Critical reception The game received generally mixed reviews, with a score of 53 on Metacritic for the PlayStation 2.

Bumble and the Stingers were an American instrumental ensemble in the early 1960s, who specialized in rock and roll arrangements of classical melodies. Their biggest hits were \\"Bumble Boogie\\", which reached number 21 in the US, and \\"Nut Rocker\\", which reached number 1 in the UK Singles Chart in 1962. The recordings were made by session musicians at Rendezvous Records in Los Angeles, but when they became successful a touring group was formed led by R. C. Gamble (3 November 1941 - 2 August 2008) as \\"Billy Bumble\\". Background In 1959, Earl Palmer, Ren√© Hall and Plas Johnson, all African American musicians from Louisiana, were the house band at Rendezvous Records. According to Palmer, the three friends ‚Äúalways talked about how we could make some money and not leave the studio. One day I said, 'Let's do a rock version of \\"In the Mood\\"'. The single, credited to the Ernie Fields Orchestra, became a hit, reaching number 4 on the US pop charts in early 1960. \\"Bumble Boogie\\" Hall then came up with the idea for B. Bumble and the Stingers, taking the same approach to a piece of classical music. Prompted by record producer Kim Fowley, he approached pianist Jack Fina, whose 1946 swing arrangement of Rimsky-Korsakov's \\"Flight of the Bumble Bee\\" for Freddy Martin and his Orchestra, called \\"Bumble Boogie\\" (RCA Victor 20-1829), had reached number 7 on the chart and been used in the 1948 Walt Disney animated film Melody Time. Using Fina's arrangement, Fowley recorded pianist Ernie Freeman on two tracks, one using a grand piano for the rhythm part, while the other featured a \\"tack piano\\", a modified upright piano with tacks pressed into the hammers to create a tinny \\"honky tonk\\" sound. The other musicians on the session, at Gold Star Studios, were Palmer on drums, Red Callender on bass, and Tommy Tedesco on guitar. \\"Bumble Boogie\\" went to number 21 on the Billboard charts in June 1961. Because the session musicians all had other studio commitments, a teen band from Ada, Oklahoma, who had played no part in the recording itself, was recruited to handle promotion and public appearances. Their names were given as Fred Richards, Don Orr, and \\"B. Bumble\\", a pseudonym for guitarist R. C. Gamble. Epinions.Com - A Little Bit Of Big-Band, Boogie-Woogie, Classical, Jazz, Pop, R&B; & Rock - Ernie Freeman \\"Nut Rocker\\" Follow-up records \\"Boogie Woogie\\", with Freeman's tack piano double tracked, and \\"Caravan\\", were less successful, and Rendezvous seemed to lose interest in B. Bumble and the Stingers. Fowley then secured the copyright to an arrangement of the march from Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker, and took this to local entrepreneur and pianist H. B. Barnum, who recorded it under the name \\"Jack B. Nimble and the Quicks\\" on the small Del Rio label. When Rod Pierce of Rendezvous heard it, he convinced Fowley that his label could do a better version with their own band. A recording date was quickly arranged, but on the day, Freeman did not appear. In his place, guitarist and arranger Ren√© Hall rushed pianist Al Hazan into the Rendezvous office, which was rigged up as an improvised studio. According to Hazan, \\"Rod decided to record the first take while I was still trying to practice the piece with the other musicians. Because I was so rushed to learn 'Nut Rocker', I was not happy at all with my performance on that first take. However, in spite of my asking Rod to let me do it over again, he said he liked it just fine the way it was.\\" Released as \\"Nut Rocker\\" in February 1962, the record went to number 23 in the US and number 1 in the UK. Del Rio struck a deal with Randy Wood of Dot Records and re-released what they were now calling \\"(The Original) Nut Rocker\\" by Jack B. Nimble and the Quicks, but it was not a hit. Later releases and legacy Such was \\"Nut Rocker\\"'s popularity in Britain that a touring group, with Hazan and R. C. Gamble, was flown over in October 1962 to promote the follow-up, \\"Apple Knocker\\", based on Rossini's William Tell Overture. However, neither that record nor the next release, \\"Dawn Cracker\\", based on \\"Morning Mood\\" from Peer Gynt by Grieg, was successful, and no more B. Bumble and the Stingers records were issued on Rendezvous after 1963, when that label went out of business. (Some singles were released on other labels, from 1964 to 1972. Hall went on to work with Sam Cooke and many others, Palmer and Freeman became successful session musicians, Fowley moved on to work as a producer and as svengali to the Runaways, and Hazan later recorded solo as Ali Hassan (on instrumentals) and Al Anthony (as a singer). R. C. Gamble retired from music in 1965 and later became an economics professor at Fort Hays State College in Hayes, Kansas. He died in August 2, 2008. A version of \\"Nut Rocker\\" (spelled \\"Nutrocker\\") was recorded in 1972 by Emerson, Lake & Palmer. The original version was reissued at the same time, and again made the UK chart (number 19). The recording has been used as background in several movies, including Butcher Boy (1998), The Young Poisoner's Handbook (1995), and Big Momma's House (2000). A version of \\"Bumble Boogie\\" was recorded in Nashville in 1983 by Mike Bunis. It was released on Gold Coast Records. In addition to Bunis on piano, it featured Steve Phillips (guitar), Duane Dursma (bass), and Barry Byrd (drums). According to sources, it was recorded at Sound Control Studios on a Yamaha upright piano.

The mixed use stadium holds 5,038 people and can be used for a number of events year-round, including baseball, soccer, football, festivals, graduations, and similar events. The multi-use stadium was originally designed to be the home field of the Pensacola Pelicans; it hosts the Minnesota Twins Double-A affiliate, the Pensacola Blue Wahoos. The stadium is situated facing the Pensacola Bay. History On April 28, 2009, the Pensacola City Council gave final approval for the ballpark to be built. The entire project cost $54 million and was completed in time for the Blue Wahoos' inaugural home opener on April 5, 2012. Building the ballpark cost $23,845,045.23. Admiral Fetterman Field Description Admiral Fetterman Field Admiral Fetterman Field is a , 5,038 seat multi-use stadium. Construction includes precast concrete bowl seating, steel framed elevated slabs, post-tensioned slabs-on-grade, and an auger cast pile foundation with concrete grade beams and pile caps. This project was custom designed to meet the needs for the use by a minor league baseball team as well as for accommodating other sporting and festival type events. The structure and slab- on-grade was pile supported due to poor soil conditions and concern over scour from hurricanes. During steel fabrication and foundation construction, an AA baseball team was acquired. This acquisition required enhancements to the stadium. This was a challenge for the design team who worked diligently to adjust the structure while using newly constructed elements within the enhancements, while providing subcontractors information needed to keep construction moving forward without incurring additional mobilization fees. Randall K. and Martha A. Hunter Amphitheater Description The amphitheater has architecturally exposed steel trusses and frames supporting curved steel roof purlins with a heavy timber, tongue-and-groove roof deck. The steel trusses and frames are designed and shaped to resemble the fronds of a palm tree. The steel structure is supported on concrete piers that are supported on a large concrete pile cap that rests on auger-cast-in-place piles. The concrete piers also support the main stage floor. The stage floor is a flat plate, thick post-tensioned concrete slab. UWF Football As of the 2016 season, the stadium hosts the West Florida Argonauts football team.

The game is based on the Rocky movies. In the game the player controls Rocky Balboa on his journey from a club fighter, facing opponents like Spider Rico, until his championship bout against Apollo Creed and beyond. The game sticks closely to the movies with all characters being at least mentioned in the movies. In at least the PAL markets the PS2 and Xbox versions of the game were packaged alongside the original Rocky DVD release. A sequel was also made, called Rocky Legends. Gameplay The gameplay mirrors that of any other boxing game of its generation. In Story Mode, the player takes control of Rocky Balboa fighting many opponents, either new or already existent within the film series. Regular boxing match rules apply to any fight: winning depends on how many punches the player has landed or if his/her opponent has been knocked down and not got up within a ten-second time limit. The maximum number of rounds in a match is fifteen, and a round may last for a maximum of 180 seconds. Story Mode also includes training minigames, where the player can increase Rocky's stats. Each individual minigame increases a specific stat: *Punching Mitts: Strength *Speed Bag: Speed *Skipping: Stamina *Sit ups: Determination *Heavy Bag: Movement Besides Story Mode, other modes include Exhibition Match, Sparring, and Knockout Tournament. Audio and video content used from the film series The game's intro movie features film footage edited from the five movies showing the main boxers and ends with an advert for the Rocky DVD. The remaining five cutscenes feature CGI footage using the in-game character models and original film audio recreating segments from the films. The song \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" is the only one from the movie series featured in the game, the rest of the score being created in-house. Development The game was developed for Xbox and PlayStation 2 at the Newcastle upon Tyne studio of Rage Software. A derivative GameCube conversion was developed by Steel Monkeys in Scotland, and a Game Boy Advance version with different gameplay by Virtucraft. It was published by Rage Software, and in the US additionally by Ubisoft. Reception The game was met with positive to mixed reception. GameRankings gave it a score of 78.75% for the Xbox version, 76.61% for the PlayStation 2 version, 72.30% for the GameCube version, and 58.63% for the Game Boy Advance version. Metacritic gave the game a score of 74 out of 100 for all console versions except the Game Boy Advance version, which was given a score of 63 out of 100. Owing to positive critical reception and sales, after the closure of Rage Software the developers of the lead version formed Venom Games to create a sequel, Rocky Legends, this time published directly by Ubisoft.

Old Spice High School Showcase debuted in 2005 as a way to fill programming on the then-nascent ESPNU channel, which had debuted in March 2005. The series aired only four games in 2005, but after much success ESPN expanded its schedule to a full thirteen game season. Part of what lead ESPN to expanding its schedule is, in 2005, ESPN aired the highest rated high school football game in television history. Nease High School (Florida) vs. Hoover High School (Alabama) garnered a 1.0 rating and attracted nearly one million households. Most High School Showcase games span from late August through the end of October.

Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic gave the album four stars out of five, saying \\"Budden's debut isn't quite an instant classic, as he's still better at freestyling verses than crafting hooks, and the album could use a couple more non-White Boy productions, if only for the sake of variety, but it's nonetheless promising, an omen of a greater things to come, for Budden as well as for listeners.\\" Chris Ryan of SPIN gave the album an eight out of ten, saying \\"This tension between bragging and insecurity, between the night out and the morning after, gives Joe Budden a singular spark. If the album falters, it's when Budden guns for crossover appeal; cameos by Lil' Mo and 112 reek of boardroom tampering. But even a bit of lab-tested R&B; can't ruin this bold debut.\\" HipHopDX reviewer K.B. Tindal gave the album a four and a half out of five, saying \\"The joy in this CD is that Joe did it without shiny suits, without a lot of ice and without an over needed amount of featured guests.

It was erected in 1915‚Äì16 by the industrialist Henry Clay Frick. The Flemish-Gothic structure's original purpose was to serve as a shopping arcade. History Known as the Union Arcade, it featured 240 shops and galleries. The mansard roof is adorned with terra cotta dormers and two chapel-like mechanical towers. The interior is arranged about a central rotunda, capped by a stained glass dome. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The roof of the Union Trust Building Designed by Frederick J. Osterling, the building was constructed on the site of Pittsburgh's nineteenth century St. Paul's Catholic Cathedral. It is not known to have been modeled after any particular building, but Brussels Town Hall, Leuven Town Hall (both Brabantine Gothic) and the then-new Woolworth Building have been suggested as influences. The design has also been partially attributed to Pierre A. Liesch (1872‚Äì1954), who worked with Osterling on the project. Liesch was a native of Luxembourg and later used a similar Flemish Gothic style for his design of the Croatian Fraternal Union Building. The Union Trust Company purchased the structure in 1923, renaming it from the Union Arcade to the Union Trust Building, as well as remodeling the first four floors. Many people believe that the building's unique roof is the result of a restrictive covenant placed on the land by its previous owner, the Diocese of Pittsburgh. One story is that the bishop at the time (Rev. Richard Phelan) placed a restrictive covenant on the land when Frick purchased it so that, although it would now have commercial purposes, residents would always remember the cathedral that once stood there. Another story suggests that there is a requirement that a place of worship must be maintained perpetually on the site, and thus there is supposedly a chapel in one of the towers to comply. This is all urban legend ‚Äì there was no restrictive covenant or other restriction in the original 1901 deed transferring ownership from religious to secular use. On May 31, 1984 San Francisco 49ers, Pittsburgh Penguins and Pittsburgh Maulers owner Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr. purchased the building. In 2008, it was purchased by California investors Michael Kamen and Gerson Fox; by August 2012 the building was the subject of bankruptcy proceedings to avoid a sheriff's sale. In 2014 the property was sold at a foreclosure auction for $14 million to its current owner, an affiliate of Boston-based The Davis Companies. The Davis Companies' affiliate outbid lender SA Challenger. Extensive restorations were completed in 2016 at a cost of $100 million, with two first-floor restaurants opening and restoration of the tenth-floor theater yet to be completed. Popular culture The building is featured in the 2010 rap video \\"Black and Yellow\\" and is seen in the movie She's Out of My League.

Boats trying to navigate North on Lake Michigan need to carefully work their way between Beaver Island and Gray's Reef. The cylindrical tower was built in 1858, to replace an 1852 tower. The decagonal lantern room offers panoramic vistas of the Lake. The tower is open to the public from 8:00 a.m. though 9:00 p.m. during the summer. In 1866, the attached yellow brick lighthouse keeper's dwelling was constructed. A frame addition was added to the keepers quarters to accommodate assistant keepers.Wobser, David, Beaver Head (Beaver Island) Light at boatnerd.com. In 1915, the fog signal building was constructed. Other outbuildings on the grounds including an oil house, garage and storage building and outhouse. A radio beacon was placed in 1962, at which time the station was decommissioned and declared surplus. That same year, the original Fourth Order Fresnel lens was removed and placed in the dwelling, where it can still be seen. In 1975, the Charlevoix Public Schools purchased the site for $1.00. After some vandalism was incurred, in 1978 the District founded an alternative school for youth aged 16‚Äì21. The school district has operated an Environmental and Vocational Educational Center in the keepers dwelling. Maintenance and restoration of the structure is part of the curriculum. Beginning in 1978, recurrent summer work/study programs greatly restored the station, which was then opened as a school. In 2003, a grant was obtained to repair spalling of the exterior brick work on the fog signal building. A state grant awarded two years later provided $23,000 for oil house restoration. The light station is listed on National Register of Historical Places (reference #78001495). It is also on the State List/Inventory.

The organization hosts a variety of horticulturally related tours, activities, and competitions organized at annual national conventions held each fall. These competitions also serve as the national level for finalists from horticulture competitions held by 4-H, FFA, The Grange, and similar organizations at state or local levels. Preparations for these competitions help train youth in areas such as speech, presentation, and horticultural knowledge, but also, it is hoped, builds in them a greater appreciation for horticulture. Additionally, the organization aims to enrich education and to guide youth to pursue a career in horticulture. NJHA Goals # To promote and sponsor educational programs for youth through a variety of projects and activities that foster a better understanding of horticulture. # To develop good citizens with a basic understanding of nature and an acceptance of responsibility for the environment in which we live. # To acquaint youth with the many and varied career opportunities, both vocational and professional, available in the horticultural industry. # To provide young people and their adult leaders with new experiences in group participation, cooperation and leadership at the national level. Leadership The Board of Trustees of the National Junior Horticultural Foundation, Inc. (NJHF) is the adult-based side of the National Junior Horticultural Association. Those who might be on the foundation board are representatives of horticulturally related corporations and associations, land-grant universities, the Cooperative Extension Service, FFA, youth officers, and anybody who privately donates $500 toward the organization. The Foundation board nominates various NJHA alumni leaders to coordinate NJHA programs‚Äînational program chairperson, national vice program chairperson, adult advisor(s), and executive secretary. The program chairperson appoints national project leaders, and state program leaders. Youth officers must first be interviewed by the adult advisor(s), NJHA past president, NJHA current president, and the executive secretary (the nominating committee). The youth officers are nominated by that committee and are presented to the youth attending the convention. Youth officers are then elected at the NJHA annual convention from youth delegates their term is until the next year‚Äôs convention.

In 1992, however, with gardens established for 18 years, Interbay P-Patch gardeners had to move the P-Patch to the northeast corner of the landfill to make way for a proposed golf course. The soil in the new location was heavy with clay and lacked humus. Gardeners labored to build the soil. Garden volunteers used money from a Neighborhood Matching Grant to build the first tool shed and compost bins. Gardeners also added the food bank area, and built raised beds. Four years later, in 1996, the city announced new plans for a golf course. The City Council adopted a new resolution allocating funding to move the Interbay P-Patch and ensure garden plots equal to or better than the existing gardens. The resolution guaranteed gardeners of soil, and raised beds.  Features  City residents may rent up to of space in the garden from the city annually. Gardeners may grow whatever they wish except for trees or large bushes and the produce from each plot remains the property of the gardener. Over of garden space along the fences are dedicated to food bank gardening, which traditionally furnishes about two tons of produce to community food banks each year. The east side of the garden features an orchard of plum, pear, and apple trees, many of which gardeners moved from the previous garden location. Honey bee hives are nestled in a secure enclosure near the back of the garden. Recycling is a part of the garden's culture. The main north‚Äìsouth walkway is made from recycled pavers from Alki Beach, and the main walkway includes granite pavers from South Africa that did not meet the standards for Westlake Mall. The Rowe family donated the greenhouse to the garden in 2000, and in 2003 the city donated the arbor entrances, which previously served as security enclosures for portable public toilets. Interbay gardeners donated a memorial bench at the north arbor entrance in honor of Claire \\"Pappy\\" Watkins, Interbay's late \\"King of Compost\\". Ray Schutte designed and built the cobblestone entrance walkway and planter in 2006 from cobblestones first used as ballast in ships before their installation at Seattle's Occidental Park. When the city redesigned the park, Interbay P-Patch was fortunate enough to receive these cobblestones. The aluminum flag pole was one of the original 50 poles placed in front of the 1962 World's Fair Flag Pavilion. CAST design/build designed Interbay's award-winning tool shed/library/kitchen, completed in 2002. The shed and surrounding open space are the focal point for many community events, including Friday night potlucks, Saturday lunches, a New Year's Day celebration, and several garden fundraisers each year. CAST design/build also designed the kiosk, added in 2004. Lease Crutcher Lewis donated materials, and a grant from Starbucks helped pay for the kiosk. Gardener and facilities Coordinator Bruce Swee designed the kiosk's water feature to honor long-time Interbay gardeners Anne and Mac Magruder, who planted the grape arbor. The \\"Gathering Bell\\" at the edge of the garden's plaza was given to Airgas Nor Pac as thanks for its financial support of cystic fibrosis cure research. Airgas wished to share this with the community and decided to donate it to the Interbay P-Patch in 2006. Bruce Swee designed the Interbay P-Patch flag donated to the garden by John and Vickie Bjorkman in 2005. Garden fundraising events also funded Bruce Swee's design and construction of the steel gates on the chipper/shredder storage shed in 2007. Volunteers who garden at Interbay built and maintain the structures and community areas at the garden.

It is native to Europe, Asia and North Africa from the Netherlands to Morocco east to Japan and the Philippines, including China, Siberia, Central Asia, Iran, Turkey, Ukraine, Germany, France Italy and a host of other countries. It is now introduced to North America and considered a weedy invasive species in the eastern half of the United States from Florida to Oklahoma to New Hampshire to Ontario to South Dakota.Biota of North America Project, Najas minor This plant prefers calm waters, such as ponds, reservoirs, and lakes, and is capable of growing in depths up to 4 meters. Identification Najas minor grows in dense clusters and has highly branched stems. These stems fragment easily and this plant is capable of propagation from stem fragments or from small seeds which grow along its stem. The small flowers are located in clusters along the leaf axils. The leaves of the plant are opposite, unbranched, strap-shaped, and are around 4.5 centimeters in length. The leaves have serrations which are visible to the naked eye. This plant is similar in morphology to coontail or slender naiad.Carlo Allioni. 1773. Auctarium ad Synopsim Methodicam Stirpium Horti Reg. Taurinensis 3, Najas minorCarlo Allioni. 1774.

Thai Forest Bulletin 44: 104-107. doi: 10.20531/TFB.2016.44.2.03 Invasive spread and control Brittle naiad was introduced to the United States, where it is considered an invasive species or noxious weed, in the 1900s. Brittle naiad in the United States is established in the Mid-Atlantic States. Established populations are found as far west as Oklahoma and Ontario, Canada in the north. The presence of this plant is a problem because its dense growth covers wide areas, inhibiting the growth of native species of aquatic macrophytes. The thick, clustering growths of brittle naiad can make fishing access or the operation of a boat difficult in a pond or lake. Brittle naiad may spread to new areas by stem fragments carried on a boat's hull, deck, propeller, or trailer. Control measures for brittle naiad include the use of aquatic herbicides, but application of chemicals may not destroy the seeds. Grass carp are another widely used control measure and have been known to readily consume brittle naiad plants. Mechanical harvesting of brittle naiad is difficult, as the brittle stems readily break and are easily disbursed throughout the system. As with most invasive species, prevention of an infestation is easier than eradication.

It runs west-to-east in Roger Mills, Dewey and Custer counties. The current SH-47 was first established in late 1936. Over time it was expanded, reaching its current extent in 1945. A lettered spur route, SH-47A, was added in 1965. Route description State Highway 47 begins at the Texas state line, where FM 2124 becomes SH-47 upon entering Oklahoma, in the Black Kettle National Grassland. Four miles (6.4 km) later, SH-30 joins the highway for a three-mile (5 km) concurrency just south of Reydon. Just outside the community of Rankin, SH-30 turns to the south, and SH-47 continues off to the east. A few miles west of Cheyenne, SH-47A branches off in a loop to the north, rejoining Highway 47 in a couple of miles. South of Cheyenne, SH-47 joins US-283 for a concurrency to the north. SH-33 also joins in on the concurrency, with a signed direction opposite that of SH-47 (a wrong-way concurrency). SH-47 and US-283/SH-33 parts ways at Roll, where SH-47 resumes its travel to the east. From Roll, the highway travels to a junction with SH-34 just south of Leedey. SH-47 continues east for until it reaches a junction with US-183. There, it turns to the south for a five-mile (8 km) concurrency. After leaving US-183, SH-47 travels another to the east to its terminus at SH-33 in Thomas. History The current incarnation of State Highway 47 was first commissioned on November 12, 1936. Originally, the highway began at SH-34 south of Leedey and proceeded east to end at SH-14 (present-day US-183) south of Putnam. However, the road was removed from the state highway system just over a year later, on the last day of 1937. It was brought back with the same extent on June 19, 1939. Throughout the early 1940s, SH-47 underwent a period of expansion. The first extension of the highway came on June 20, 1940, when it was extended west to end at US-283 in Roll. SH-47 was extended east to Thomas via US-183 on May 31, 1944. The final extension occurred on October 1, 1945, when the highway was extended south down US-283 to Cheyenne, then west to the Texas state line. SH-33 and SH-47 swapped places west of US-283 on July 9, 1956; SH-47 proceeded due west of Roll to the Texas state line, while SH-33 passed through Cheyenne and turned toward the west south of there. This gave both highways straighter courses and resolved the wrong-way concurrency. However, the change was rescinded on August 13, 1956. Two minor realignments were done to SH-47 in the 1960s. The first, on April 3, 1961, relocated the highway west of Aledo, while the other one, on May 5, 1964, adjusted it between Roll and Angora. SH-47 has undergone no changes since. Junction list Spurs right Two highways have served as branch routes during SH-47's history. Both of these bore the SH-47A designation. Historic Historically, SH-47A was a spur serving the central business district of Reydon. The highway was commissioned on a temporary basis on February 8, 1950. Its alignment was adjusted, and the highway received a permanent commission, on January 8, 1951. The highway was turned back over to the town on December 6, 1954. Current The current SH-47A is a loop route that connects to SH-47 at both ends west of Cheyenne. The highway is entirely located within Roger Mills County and the Black Kettle National Grassland. It provides access to the Washita Battlefield National Historic Site. SH-47A was commissioned on September 7, 1965.

His parents were Samuel Weiss, originally from Austria-Hungary and a merchant, and the former Gisella Elias, of Berlin, Germany. Seymour had three brothers: Bernard, Milton, and Julius. On January 10, 1954, Bernard and Milton died in a private airplane crash, along with Thomas Elmer Braniff, the owner of the airline, and a number of other civic leaders from Shreveport, Louisiana, and Dallas, Texas. The men had been on a private hunting trip to South Texas and South Louisiana; the plane crashed in a freak ice storm. Weiss' last brother, Julius, died later the same year on August 30, 1954, of personal health issues. Seymour was educated in public schools in Bunkie and Abbeville in Vermilion Parish. For a time he was a department store clerk in Alexandria in Rapides Parish and the largest city in Central Louisiana. He moved to New Orleans in 1916 to clerk in a shoe store. After the United States' entry into World War I, Weiss attended officers' training at Camp Gordon, Georgia, but the conflict ended before Weiss finished his training. Thereafter, he returned to New Orleans to resume work as a shoe clerk. Seymour was married twice: on April 19, 1925, to Notie \\"Fay\\" Turner, and then on June 12, 1963, to Elva Mae Lavie Kimball, whom he predeceased. He died in Baton Rouge and is interred at the family plot at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans. (Plot: Sec. 34, Lot 19). The Roosevelt Hotel In 1923, Weiss became the manager of a barbershop at the Grunewald Hotel in New Orleans. In 1924, he became the assistant hotel manager, and in 1928, he was promoted to hotel manager. First built in 1893, and known as the \\"Grunewald\\" (for its original owner, Louis Grunewald), the Grunewald opened what has been called the first nightclub in the United States, a basement room decorated with fake stalactites called \\"The Cave\\", where one could watch dancing chorus girls and listen to Dixieland jazz that would easily drown out the soothing indoor waterfalls. In 1923, a consortium of local investors purchased the hotel and renamed it \\"The Roosevelt\\" in honor of President Theodore Roosevelt, who had died four years earlier. In 1931, Weiss was named president of the New Orleans Roosevelt Corp. From 1931‚Äì1965, he was the principal owner and managing director of the Roosevelt. The Cave was closed in favor of a larger venue a floor above called \\"The Blue Room\\" which became a nationally prominent music venue. Weiss sold the Roosevelt in 1965. It became the Fairmont Hotel until closing following Hurricane Katrina. In August 2007, Dimension Development Company, Inc, a Natchitoches, Louisiana-based hotel development and management company purchased the property, and is currently restoring the building with a scheduled opening date of June 25, 2009. Dimension Development Company Inc, entered into an agreement with Hilton Worldwide to brand the hotel under Hilton's premier Waldorf Astoria collection. The hotel has been rechristened The Roosevelt Hotel by Waldorf Astoria. A grand opening was held in 2009. Businessman Sam Friedman of Natchitoches was heavily involved in the reopening. He is the son of the late Louisiana State Senator Sylvan Friedman. Although he had no children, he was an uncle to Seymour Weiss, II, and S J. Weiss. His wife and sister-in-law died in a car accident, leaving behind two widowers, and two motherless children, one thirteen and one three. The father, his brother, took the thirteen-year-old, S.J., and the grandparents and Seymour took Seymour, II. Seymour, his parents, and \\"Little Seymour\\" lived in the hotel. Little Seymour married Sally McNulty and fathered Richard, David, and John Weiss. Loyal to Huey Long Weiss became a political booster of Huey Long, whom he met during the 1928 gubernatorial campaign. Weiss acted as Long's chief of protocol and resolved an unwitting comical dispute that developed when the governor received a German delegation at Mardi Gras in 1930 in a pair of pajamas, a red and blue robe, and blue bedroom slippers.Huey Pierce Long, Jr., Every Man a King: The Autobiography of Huey P. Long (New Orleans: National Book Club, Inc., 1933), pp. 192-193. Long made Weiss's Roosevelt Hotel his New Orleans headquarters. It was said that Weiss made sure Long never got lost in the hallways of the large facility. Weiss was the closest of friends and a regular golfing partner with Long. He was easily considered an \\"insider at Long's right hand.\\" Weiss was present at the bedside of Long when he died from internal infection contracted during the attempt to remove the bullets in the assassination attempt. Weiss became treasurer of both the Louisiana Democratic Association and Long's secret political fund. During the Great Depression, Weiss had control of federal relief funds in Louisiana. He was vice-president of the Win or Lose Corporation, a controversial oil company whose structure was devised by Huey Long. On Long's death, Weiss chaired the Huey P. Long Memorial Commission and remained active in the Long machine until scandals swept through the organization. Imprisonment for tax evasion In 1934, Weiss was indicted by a federal grand jury in New Orleans on tax evasion charges. He paid back taxes after the charges were dropped. He was indicted again on tax evasion and mail fraud charges growing out of the \\"Louisiana Scandals\\" of the late 1930s. He was convicted and imprisoned for sixteen months between 1940 and 1942, before he was paroled and ordered to pay back taxes. In 1947, he was given a full and unconditional pardon by Democratic U.S. President Harry Truman.The Truman Scandals and the Politics of Morality, by Andrew J. Dunar.

Ewing Weiss as civic leader Weiss was a member of the New Orleans Zoning Board and commissioner of the municipal fire and police departments between 1932 and 1936. He was also president of the board of commissioners of the Port of New Orleans from 1933‚Äì1938. He was active in the American Hotel Association and was president of the Louisiana Hotel-Motel and the New Orleans Hotel associations. He won statewide awards for hotel management in 1952 and 1957. He was a director of the New Orleans chapter of the American Red Cross, the Chamber of Commerce, and the International Trade Mart. In 1968, Weiss chaired the committee for the 250th anniversary of the founding of New Orleans. \\"Seymour Weiss\\" appears in these books * at least 25 references in Huey Long Invades New Orleans: The Siege of a City, 1934‚Äì36 by Garry Boulard (Author) * at least 25 references in Huey Long (Vintage) by T.

Award-winning books were deemed to \\"belong on the same shelf\\" as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll, having enough of the qualities of his work. Seventeen books were named in 1958, including only two from the 1950s. Seven were named in 1979, all except two from the 1970s. Although short, the last class was also diverse, with one wordless picture book, The Snowman (1978) by Raymond Briggs, and one fictionalized biography, The Road from Home (1979) by David Kherdian, about his mother's childhood during the Armenian Genocide and its aftermath. The selection process included nominations by trade paperback editors, who were permitted to name one book annually from their trade catalogs. The Component Analysis Selector Tool rated tradebooks on authenticity, universality, insight, symbol systems‚Äìcraftsmanship, impact, genre comparison, field setting of reader and test of time. The purpose was to identify and promote outstanding thoughts among the mediocre communications available in an open society. The list was established by Dr. David C. Davis with the assistance of Professor Lola Pierstorff, Director Instructional Materials Center, University of Wisconsin, and Madeline Allen Davis, WHA Wisconsin Public Radio. Awards were announced and presented at the annual Wisconsin Book Conference, which featured speakers such as Dr. Seuss, William Steig, Helga Sandburg, Arna Bontemps, Nat Hentoff, Paul Engle, Jean George, Ed Emberley, Charlemae Rollins, Watts poet Jimmy Sherman, Maurice Sendak, Holling C.

History It was founded and managed by the famous Swedish playwright August Strindberg and the young actor August Falck (1882‚Äì1938) between 1907 and 1910. The playhouse was a small (6 x 6 meters) but engaging space based on the designs of the French and German models of the time. strindbergsintimateater The small auditorium could hold up to 150 patrons and featured some of the most advanced lighting innovations of the day. The size of the space in no way limited the company but actually encouraged continuous experimentation. The author used the stage for his own plays as well as for guest performances of modern drama from abroad. In all, 25 of Strindberg's plays were performed and a total number of 2500 performances were given during the theatre's short but highly influential existence. Among its most successful stagings were the original productions of Easter, The Ghost Sonata, Miss Julie and Svanevit. The theatre also triumphed on tour throughout Scandinavia and Europe. After Strindberg's death in 1912 the theatre was locked up and remained closed for years. Between the 1920s‚Äì1980s it was used as an assembly hall for various trade union meetings and for public lectures. In the early 1990s, however, the debate grew among theatre goers that Strindberg's old theatre deserved better. Discussions on how to make the theatre live again and have a permanent repertoire once more became lively, especially after the Strindberg Theatre Festival in 1993. Many theatre groups, businessmen and private people expressed their interest in a revival. Funds were raised in 1998 for renovations the theatre desperately needed. In 2001 the Culture Department in Stockholm took the initiative for its re-opening and production schedule. The repertoire today consists of the theatre's own productions and those in association with the Royal Dramatic Theatre, of international guest performances and those from Swedish regional theatres, as well as theatre productions for schools and children.

It is the largest monument in Halebidu, a town in the state of Karnataka, India and the former capital of the Hoysala Empire. The temple was built on the banks of a large man-made lake, and sponsored by King Vishnuvardhana of the Hoysala Empire. Its construction started around 1121 CE and was complete in 1160 CE.Foekema (1996), p.59 During the early 14th century, Halebidu was twice sacked and plundered by the Muslim armies of the Delhi Sultanate from northern India, and the temple and the capital fell into a state of ruin and neglect.Kamath (2001), p129 It is from Hassan city and about from Bengaluru. The Hoysaleswara temple is a Shaivism tradition monument, yet reverentially includes many themes from Vaishnavism and Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, as well as images from Jainism. The Hoysaleswara temple is a twin-temple dedicated to Hoysaleswara and Santaleswara Shiva lingas, named after the masculine and feminine aspects, both equal and joined at their transept. It has two Nandi shrines outside, where each seated Nandi face the respective Shiva linga inside. The temple includes a smaller sanctum for the Hindu Sun god Surya. It once had superstructure towers, but no longer and the temple looks flat. The temple faces east, though the monument is presently visited from the north side. Both the main temples and the Nandi shrines are based on a square plan. The temple was carved from soapstone. It is notable for its sculptures, intricate reliefs, detailed friezes as well its history, iconography, inscriptions in North Indian and South Indian scripts. The temple artwork provides a pictorial window into the life and culture in the 12th century South India. About 340 large reliefs depict the Hindu theology and associated legends. Numerous smaller friezes narrate Hindu texts such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata Purana. Some friezes below large reliefs portray its narrative episodes. The artwork in Hoysaleswara temple is damaged but largely intact. Within a few kilometers of the temple are numerous ruins of Hoysala architecture. The temple, along with the nearby Jain Temples and the Kedareshwara temple,as well as the Kesava temple in Belur, have been proposed to be listed under UNESCO World Heritage Sites.Permanent Delegation of India to UNESCO (2014), Sacred Ensembles of the Hoysala, UNESCO Location The Hoysaleswara Temple is in Halebidu, also called Halebeedu, Halebid, Dorasamudra. Halebidu is a town in Hassan district of the Indian state of Karnataka. It is about northwest of Hassan. The temple is about from Belur, Karnataka temples. Halebidu has no nearby airport, and is about west of Bengaluru (IATA Code: BLR), about 4 hours drive accessible with a four lane NH75 highway through Hassan. Halebidu is connected by railway network at Hassan to major cities of Karnataka. History Siva and Parvathi relief at Hoysaleswara temple The Hoysala period of South Indian history began about 1000 CE and continued through 1346 CE. In this period, they built around 1,500 temples in 958 centres. Halebidu was originally called Dvarasamudra (or Dorasamudra), a name derived from two Sanskrit words \\"Dvara\\" (gateway, door) and Samudra (ocean, sea, large water body). The capital used to be Belur, Karnataka, but Dvarasamudra became the established capital under king Vishnuvardhana and served as the capital of the Hoyasala Empire for nearly 300 years.Om Prakash Prasad (1979), Three Capital towns of the Hoysalas, Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, Vol. 40 (1979), pp. 88-90 Unlike other Hoysala temples that have survived into the modern age, and despite numerous inscriptions in the temple premises, the Hoysaleswara Temple lacks a dedication inscription. It is likely lost, along with the many other features of the original temple. An inscription found about five kilometers from the temple site, near the Kallesvara temple ruins in Ghattadahalli, states that Ketamalla ‚Äì officer in the employ of king Vishnuvardhana constructed this temple. It also notes that the king made grant of lands to support the construction, the operation and the maintenance of the Shiva temple in Saka 1043, or 1121 CE. It was not the only temple built in that era. The inscriptions suggest that the capital consisted of numerous other temples, both of Hinduism and Jainism traditions, along with stepwells, ponds and mantapas (mandapas, public halls) in the vicinity of the large Dorasamudhra lake. Evidence within the temple suggest that the temple was reconstructed and repaired over its history, sometimes for enhancements, sometimes to address structural issue with the towers above it (now missing), and sometimes after wars with the remains of ruined temples elsewhere in the region. It is the largest temple built by the Hoysalas that is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva in South India. The Hoysala Empire and its capital Dvarasamudra was invaded, plundered and destroyed in early 14th century by the Delhi Sultanate armies of Alauddin Khilji, with Belur and Halebidu becoming the target of plunder and destruction in 1326 CE by another Delhi Sultanate army of Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq. The territory was taken over by the Vijayanagara Empire. The Hoysala style, states James C. Harle, came to an end in mid 14th century, when King Ballala III was killed in a war with the Muslim army led by Malik Kafur. Dvarasamudra and its temples became ruins, the capital abandoned and the site became known as \\"Halebidu\\" (literally, \\"old camp or capital\\").JF Fleet, Nele- Vidu: Appayana-Vidu, The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, Cambridge University Press, pp. 117-119 About 300 of the original Hoysala Empire temples survive in different states of damage, scattered around the Halebid region. Of these, states Hardy, about 70 had been studied to varying degrees of detail by 1995. Description 12th century Halebid Shiva temple plan annotated The Hoysaleswara temple, also spelled as Hoysaleshwara or Hoywalesvara temple, is a twin-temple, or dvikuta vimana (plan with two shrines and two superstructures). The two temples are of the same size, and their sanctums open to the east, facing sunrise. The sanctum of the \\"Hoysaleswara\\" (the king) and the other for \\"Shantaleswara\\" (the queen, Shantala Devi) both have a Shiva linga. Outside on the east side of the main temples are two smaller shrines, each with seated Nandi. To the east of the southern Nandi shrine is a smaller attached Surya shrine, where there is a tall Surya statue facing the Nandi and the sanctum. Historians such as Adam Hardy state that the Hoysalesware temple shows evidence of other shrines but these are now missing, lost to history. A Nandi shrine (left) facing the sanctum of the main temple The temple complex as a whole is placed on a jagati (literally, worldly platform). The platform is 15 feet wide around the outer walls of the temple, meant for the visitor to walk on and view the artwork clockwise while completing the circumambulation of the sanctums. It is called the pradakshina-patha (path for circumambulation).Kamath (2001), p. 135 The smaller shrines share the same jagati as the main temple, connected by stone stairs. The two sanctums are next to each other in a north-south alignment, both face east, and each have in front a mandapa (also spelled mantapa, community hall). The two mandapas are connected giving a view of a large, open navaranga for family and public gatherings. The temple had towers on top of each sanctum, but they are now missing. According to Foekema, these towers must have followed the star shape of the shrine, because Hoyasala temples that are better preserved have them.Foekema (1996), p. 61 The superstructure over the vestibule which connects the shrine to the mantapa, called sukanasi (a low tower that looks like an extension of the main tower) is also missing. Similar the row of decorated miniature roofs, the eastern perimeter walls and other shrines with the main temple are all gone.Foekema (1996), p. 93 The temple was built with chloritic schist, more commonly known as greenschist or soapstone.Quote:\\"The Hoysala style is an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style\\", Kamath (2001), pp. 134-36) The soapstone is soft when quarried and easier to carve into intricate shapes, but hardens over time when exposed to air. Outer walls The temple outer walls is intricately carved. Its lowest layers consist of bands with friezes that consist of (from bottom to top) elephants, lions, scrolls with nature and miniature dancers, horses, scrolls, scenes from Hindu texts, mythical beasts (makara) and swans. According to Shadakshari Settar, the artwork shows details as \\"no two lions are alike in the entire span that covers more than a furlong (200 metres)\\", the artists \\"captured the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, and the main episodes of the Bhagavata\\". The temple's outer wall is a pictorial narration of Hindu epics, and its middle portion has large panels where \\"the entire pantheon of Hindu divinities are presented, it is a manual of Hindu iconography\\", states Settar. According to Foekema and other art historians, the quality and quantity of the epics-related \\"friezes are amazing\\", but the panel series do not complete the story in a stretch, rather after a stretch, another text is intermingled in for a while. The outer walls of the Hoysaleswara temple shrines feature 340 large reliefs. The friezes and wall images on the outer wall predominantly narrate the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana, the other major Shaiva and Vaishnava Puranas. Some main displays include (clockwise): *On the north-east outer wall of the northern Shiva temple: Court scene, Bhairava, Bharavi, Samudra manthan, musicians with 12th century musical instruments, Sukracharya, Kacha-Devayani legend, Lakshmi, Umamahesvara, Vamana-Bali-Trivikrama legend, Indra legend, Virabhadra, Shiva in yoga. *On the south-east outer wall of the northern Shiva temple: Dancers, Bhairava, Bhairavi, Umamahesvara. *On the north-east outer wall of the southern Shiva temple: Krishna's lila from Bhagavata, Vasudeva in prison followed by carrying newborn Krishna across Yamuna legend, Krishna slaying Putani and other asuri, Krishna stealing butter, Krishna playing flute with humans and animals dancing, Krishna and Pradyumna legend, Krishna lifts the goverdhana, Yudhisthira and Sakuni playing dice, Kichaka molests Draupadi and Bhima meets Kichaka dressed up as a woman to return justice.

Harihara (left half Shiva, right Vishnu) at Hoysaleshwara In terms of theology from different Hindu traditions, the large images on the outer walls of the west side present the following frequencies (excluding small panels and miniature friezes): *Shiva: as Umamahesvara (8), as Nataraja and destroyer of various demons (25), Dakshinamurti (1), as nude Bhairava (6) *Shakti: as Parvati forms of Durga, Mahishasuramardini, Kali and others (18) *Vishnu: seated or standing (15), Krishna as Venogopala (12), Varaha (2), Narasimha (4), Vamana (1), Trivikrama (1) *Harihara (half Vishnu, Half Shiva) (1) *Ganesha: seated or standing (4) *Kartikeya: on peacock (1), under seven- hooded serpent (2) *Brahma (4) *Saraswati: seated or standing (9) *Vedic deities: Indra, Surya and others (4) *Others: Vishnu in his female avatar Mohini clothed and nude, Shiva with Mohini, Arjuna and others (not counted) The walls on the other side have more large images. Doorways and mantapa The temple has four entrances. The one normally used by visitors as main entry nowadays is the northern entrance closest to the parking lot. There is one entry on the south side and two on the east side, facing two large detached open pavilions whose ceiling is supported by lathe turned pillars.Kamath (2001), p. 116 The temple originally had an open navaranga, wherein the mantapa pavilions were visible from outside shrines and the outside was visible to those in the mandapa. In the era of Hoysala king Narasimha I, the mantapa was closed, doors were added and perforated stone screens placed, according to an inscription found in the temple. Along with the four doors, the later artists added dvarapalas and decorations as follows: A better preserved dvarapala at mantapa entrance (hands broken). *Southern entrance: six feet high dvarapalas wearing jewelry on both sides of the doorway. Each has four hands (two broken, others damaged), wear jatamakuta, have third eye and fangs, and stand in S-shaped tribhanga pose. They hold Shiva icons such as damaru, cobra, trisula and others. They were defaced at some point. Attempts were made in the 20th century to trim, restore and re-polish the dvarapala faces, but it created a disproportionate artificial look. Above the door lintel, there is artwork showing a Nataraja (Tandava) along with Nandi, other dancers and musicians. *Southeastern entrance: similar to southern entrance, two hands broken but the faces are better preserved. Above the door lintel, the carving is the best preserved entrance Nataraja with ten hands (one damaged), accompanied on left by Narasimha, Saraswati, Brahma, Ganesha, Parvati, one deity damaged and unclear and Shiva, while the right side has Shiva, Parvati, Bhairava, Indrani, Keshava, Surya and Parvati. *Northeastern entrance: the doorway is damaged and dvarapalas are missing though the pedestal and panels remain. The carvings above the door lintel are defaced. *Northern entrance: used by modern-day tourists. The original dvarapalas are lost, and two replacement mispaired dvarapalas were recovered from the ruins of the region for tourists. The scene above the door lintel is also damaged and inferior in execution. Outside the southern doorway, in the park, are large statues, one of Ganesha. The statue was among those which were originally farther out at the temple premises outer gate, but damaged and collected from ruins there. They were recovered and placed close to the temple. The navaranga includes two small niches facing each other between the two temples where they are joined at the transept. These have carvings and artwork, but the statues inside each is missing. There is a stone panel near the western niche with a large Sanskrit inscription in a North Indian and a South Indian script. Lathe turned pillars in mantapa of Hoysaleshwara temple in Halebidu Pillars and ceilings The interior walls of the temple are quite plain compared to the outer wall, except for the lathe turned pillars that run in rows between the north and south entrances.Kamath (2001), p. 117) The four pillars in front of each shrine are the most ornate and the only ones that have the madanika sculptures in their pillar brackets. Pillar and ceiling carvings with a damaged madanakai. The fused mandapa features a row of pillars aligned along the north-west axis. In the central navaranga of each temple's mandapa are four pillars and a raised ceiling that is intricately carved. Each of the four pillars of this central navaranga had four standing madanakai (Salabhanjika, mostly female) figures, or a total of 16 standing figures per temple. Of the 32 figures on the central pillars for the two temples, 11 remain. Only 6 damaged ones have survived in the north temple and 5 in the south temple. A closer examination of the pillar's capital suggests that there was a figure on each pillar in the eastern row facing the sunrise, but all of these show signs of destruction and none of those images have survived. The pillar near the second eastern door have two damaged madanakai, but the better preserved are those in the central navaranga. Sanctum A sanctum inside the Hoysaleshwara temple in Halebidu The twin-temple has two sanctums (garbha griha), both with Shiva linga. One sanctum is dedicated to \\"Hoysaleswara\\" Shiva (the king) and the other for \\"Shantaleswara\\" Shiva (the queen, Shantala). Both are of equal size. Each sanctum is a square with a darsana dvara (view doorway) on the east, with three niches on the north, west and south. The doorways are flanked on each side by a dvarapala, each leading to a sukanasi (vestibule chamber). There is intricate carving above the lintel between the dvarapalas, presenting Shiva with Parvati, along with other devas and devis, as well as two large makaras (mythical syncretic sea creatures). On the makaras are Varuna and his wife Varuni riding. The doorjambs are decorated with purnaghatas (vessels of abundance). The sanctum square originally had a tower (shikhara) above rising towards the sky to complete the vimana superstructure, but the towers have been lost to history and the temple looks flat. The sanctum walls are plain, avoiding distraction to the devotee and focussing the attention of the visitor at the spiritual symbol. The temple has smaller shrines with its own sanctum. For example, the Nandi shrines feature a Nandi in its sanctum, while the Surya shrine features the Hindu Sun god. Other monuments The Hoysaleswara Temple premises include a museum managed by the Archaeological Survey of India. It contains numerous pieces of ruins and temple artwork recovered from the site for closer three dimensional examination. The temple premises also has the so-called Garuda Sthamba (Garuda pillar) to the south of the temple. It is also damaged, with its top portion gone. It contains an inscription that breaks off in the middle of the sentence. The part which can be read states that a general Lakshmana, his wife and followers sacrificed themselves after the death of Ballala II. In the middle of the pillar are eight male figures, four of whom are shown as using their swords to sacrifice themselves (siditale-godu). One of the sacrificer is shown seated in a namaste posture preparing for the sacrifice, while others are shown in the process of the sacrifice. The images represent the devotion of these to their leader and their determination to die with him. ASI museum in Halebidu with a display of artwork ruins. The temple premises show evidence of other shrine and temples. Just like the Surya (Sun) monument that is to the east of one Nandi, there was a Chandra (Moon) monument attached to the other Nandi. Excavations on the southwest side of the temple revealed the remains of a destroyed temple. Artists Numerous temple artwork panels contain signatures or statements by the artists or the guild they belonged to, and these are usually at the artwork's pedestal or underneath. The most repeated names of artists found at the Hoysaleswara temple include Manibalaki, Mabala, Ballana, Bochana, Ketana, Bama, Balaki and Revoja. The guilds can be identified by the organization's icon marked and names inscribed such as Agni- Indra, Indra, Paduca (lit. west) and Paduvala-badaga (lit. northwest). Reception According to the 19th-century art critic James Fergusson, it is a \\"marvellous exhibition of human labor to be found even in the patient east and surpasses anything in Gothic art\\". The temple of Halebidu, has been described by Percy Brown as an \\"outstanding example of Hindu architecture\\" and as the \\"supreme climax of Indian architecture\\".

Kurtosis risk applies to any kurtosis-related quantitative model that assumes the normal distribution for certain of its independent variables when the latter may in fact have kurtosis much greater than does the normal distribution. Kurtosis risk is commonly referred to as \\"fat tail\\" risk. The \\"fat tail\\" metaphor explicitly describes the situation of having more observations at either extreme than the tails of the normal distribution would suggest; therefore, the tails are \\"fatter\\". Ignoring kurtosis risk will cause any model to understate the risk of variables with high kurtosis. For instance, Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund cofounded by Myron Scholes, ignored kurtosis risk to its detriment. After four successful years, this hedge fund had to be bailed out by major investment banks in the late 1990s because it understated the kurtosis of many financial securities underlying the fund's own trading positions. Benoit Mandelbrot, a French mathematician, extensively researched this issue. He felt that the extensive reliance on the normal distribution for much of the body of modern finance and investment theory is a serious flaw of any related models including the Black‚ÄìScholes option model developed by Myron Scholes and Fischer Black, and the capital asset pricing model developed by William F. Sharpe. Mandelbrot explained his views and alternative finance theory in his book: The (Mis)Behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward published on September 18, 1997.

Helen Damico, Joseph B. Zavadil, Donald Fennema, Karmen Lenz, 55, https://books.google.com/books?id=plHnAf32FeYC&pg;=PA55 Accessed October 7, 2012 Early life Grabmann was born in Winterzhofen, Bavaria, Germany, on 5 January 1875 to a deeply religious Bavarian parents, Joseph Grabmann (1848-1915), a farmer, and Walburga Bauer (1850-1886). He had two brothers. He attended the gymnasium in Eichst√§tt. At the College of Philosophy and Theology the Bischoefliches Lyzeum, a centre of scholastic renewal, Grabmann was influenced by his teacher Franz von Paula Morgott (1829-1900) to study the work of Thomas Aquinas. Religious life In August 1895, Grabmann entered the Dominican novitate at what is now Olomouc in the Czech Republic, but he left six months later to pursue the secular priesthood. He was ordained on March 20, 1898. He became a tertiary of the Dominican Order in 1921. After ordination, he was sent by his bishop to study in Rome. Research Grabmann was an alumnus of the Collegium Divi Thom√¶ de Urbe, the future Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas Angelicum in Rome (Italy). At the Angelicum, he obtained a baccalaureate, a licentiate and a doctorate in philosophy by 1901 and a doctorate in theology in 1902. Grabmann studied palaeography at the Vatican Library and was encouraged by two of the most distinguished palaeographers of the time, Henry Denifle, the prefect of the Vatican library, and Cardinal Franz Ehrle Career Grabmann was made a professor of theology and philosophy at the Catholic University of Eichst√§tt in 1906. The first of his great works, Die Geschichte der scholastischen Methode, in two volumes, 1909 and 1911 made extensive use of unpublished medieval texts. After the publication of his two-volume work, he was awarded an honorary doctorates by the Institut sup√©rieur de philosophie (Higher Institute of Philosophy) of Louvain in 1913. Grabmann was called to the University of Vienna in 1913 to fill the chair of Christian philosophy at the Faculty of Theology. There, he completed pioneering research on the history of Aristotelianism in the 13th century which was published in 1916 as Forschungen √ºber die lateinischen Aristoteles-√úbersetzungen des XIII. Jahrhunderts. Grabmann returned to Bavaria in 1918 to serve as professor of dogmatic theology at the University of Munich. His research and publications flourished, including 212 books, articles, and reviews. Between 1921 and 1938, his research took him to most of the major Italian libraries specializing in medieval studies, as well as to libraries in Spain, France, Belgium, and Sweden. Influence in philosophy Grabmann's thought was instrumental in the modern understanding of scholasticism and the pivotal role of Aquinas. He was the first scholar to work out the outlines of the ongoing development of thought in scholasticism. He was first to see that Aquinas had a response and development of thought rather than a single, coherently emerged and organic whole. According to Battista Mondin, Grabmann interprets Aquinas' metaphysics as an advanced version of Aristotle's based on the notion of common being (ens commune) and his rational theology as employing an original concept of being to describe the Divine attributes based on the notion of subsistent being itself (esse ipsum subsistens).La metafisics di S. Tommaso d'Aquino e i suoi interpreti 2002, 44 ff. Grabmann was foundational in fostering the variety of contemporary interpretations of both scholasticism and Aquinas. Death He died in Eichst√§tt. Works Grabmann's 2-volume masterpiece The History of Scholastic Method (Die Geschichte der scolastischen Methode) (1909-1911) is the first scholarly work to outline the ongoing development of scholasticism. His Thomas Aquinas: His Personality and Thought (Thomas von Aquin, eine einf√ºhrung in seine pers√∂nlichkeit und gedankenwelt) (1912) emphasizes Aquinas' development of thought more than a single, coherent system. Although Grabmann's works in German are numerous, only Thomas Aquinas (1928) is available in English. References Sources *Cross, F.L., Livingstone, E. A.

Before the completion of the Nord Stream pipeline, it was the longest subsea pipeline in the world. History The project was launched under the original name Britpipe. In October 2003, Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil and Statoil signed agreements to supply natural gas through the Britpipe. The pipeline's construction began in 2004. The largest part of the pipeline was installed by Acergy Piper, a pipe-laying ship of Acergy. Other pipe-laying ships, which were used, are Solitaire of Allseas, and Saipem 7000 of Saipem. The pipeline was opened in two stages. The southern section (Sleipner Riser platform to Easington) began piping gas on 1 October 2006, the northern section (Nyhamna to Sleipner Riser) opened in October 2007. The official opening of the project was held in London on 16 October 2006 by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Norwegian counterpart, Jens Stoltenberg. Route Ormen Lange Nyhamna The pipeline runs through the North Sea from the Nyhamna terminal in Norway via the Sleipner Riser platform in the North Sea to Easington Gas Terminal in England. The pipeline is designated to bring natural gas from the Ormen Lange gas process terminal to the UK, but through the connector at Sleipner Riser it provides also an opportunity to send gas through Gassco's existing network to continental Europe. Technical description The annual capacity of the Langeled pipeline is . That equates to some 20% of Britain's peak gas demand. With the energy content of natural gas at 39 MJ (megajoules) per normal cubic meter, the capacity energy flux is 31.5 GW (gigawatts). The Langeled pipeline supplements the Vesterled system with annual capacity about 12 bcm, which runs from Heimdal Riser platform in the North Sea to St. Fergus in Scotland. The project cost ¬£1.7 billion. Nyhamna-Sleipner Riser section The Nyhamna- Sleipner Riser leg has a diameter of and can operate with a pressure of 250 bar. Hub at Sleipner Riser At Sleipner Riser the Langeled has a connection to the existing Gassled transport system. Sleipner Riser- Easington section The Sleipner Riser-Easington leg has a diameter of , which makes it the largest submarine pipeline in the North Sea. Its pressure is 155 bar. Ownership and operation The owner of the Langeled pipeline is Gassled. The operator for Langeled is Gassco and technical service provider is Statoil. Statoil also runs the gas export project. The principal funding of the project was provided by the syndicated loan structured by ABN AMRO and mainly subscribed by several banks, among them Barclays Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Defoe Fournier & Cie.

Their cutting-edge exhibitions helped forge the reputations of many of the most important Modernist artists. History Heinrich Thannhauser (1859‚Äì1935) opened the first of the Thannhauser Galleries in Munich in the fall of 1909, after deciding to leave the gallery that he had previously opened with his friend Franz Josef Brakl. He called his new business the Modern Gallery (Moderne Galerie) and established it in the glass- domed Arcopalais at Theatinerstra√üe 7, in the heart of Munich's shopping district. The gallery was, by most accounts, one of the largest and most beautiful art galleries in the city. Designed by local architect Paul Wenz, it occupied over 2,600 square feet of the glass-domed Arcopalais. The gallery was divided between two floors, with nine exhibition rooms on the ground floor and an open, skylit gallery on the floor above. Several of the rooms were set up as domestic environments, as was fashionable at the time. In its early years, the Moderne Galerie (more commonly known as the Moderne Galerie Heinrich Thannhauser) exhibited the work of some of the most notable French Impressionists, Post-Impressionists, and Italian Futurists. It also presented the earliest exhibitions of contemporary German movements and artists who would later come to define the avant-garde: Neue K√ºnstlervereinigung M√ºnchen (New Artists' Association of Munich) in 1909, and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) in 1911. Exhibitions: Thannhauser Collection, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation Both exhibitions featured the work of Vasily Kandinsky, considered by many to be the pioneer of abstraction in art. The gallery also participated in the Armory Show of 1913, the watershed exhibition that introduced European Modernism to the United States, and mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective during the same year. In 1919, Heinrich Thannhauser's son, Justin K. Thannhauser (1892-1976), established a branch of the gallery in Lucerne (Luzern), Switzerland. He ran the branch until 1921, when he was called back to Munich to assist his father, who had developed a serious condition in his larynx. The Lucerne gallery continued to be under Justin's direction until 1928, when his cousin Siegfried Rosengart assumed control and changed its name to Galerie Rosengart. Over the years, Heinrich and Justin Thannhauser purchased, traded or had on consignment 107 works by Van Gogh or attributed to him. In 2017, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam published the catalogue The Thannhauser Gallery: Marketing Van Gogh. Justin established a third branch in Berlin in 1927. During the 1930s, however, the business operations of all of the Thannhauser Galleries were sanctioned and delayed by the Nazi government. The Nazis were vehemently opposed to the art of the avant-garde, which they branded as \\"degenerate art.\\" After the death of Heinrich in 1935 and the formal closing of the Galleries in 1937, Galerie Thannhauser, Munich, in Museum of Modern Art's \\"German Expressionism\\" Thannhauser and his family left for Paris. In 1940, they moved to New York, where Justin, together with his second wife, Hilde (1919‚Äì91), established himself as an art dealer. The Thannhausers‚Äô support of artistic progress, and their advancement of the early careers of artists like Kandinsky, Franz Marc, and Paul Klee, paralleled the vision of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum‚Äôs founder, Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861‚Äì1949). In recognition of that connection, and in honor of his first wife and two sons (who died at tragically young ages), Justin Thannhauser bequeathed the most essential and iconic works of his collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Guggenheim Foundation in 1963. Beginning in 1965, the works were on loan to the museum and on view in the Thannhauser Wing. The collection formally entered the Guggenheim's permanent holdings in 1978, two years after Thannhauser's death, and the museum received a bequest of 10 additional works after the death of Hilde Thannhauser in 1991. The gift, containing over 70 works in total, Collection Online: Major Acquisition > Thannhauser Collection, The Solomon R.

Its foundations (circa 960 AD) rest on remnants of a Roman chapel, built on what was then an island in the Rhine. The church was later transformed into a Benedictine monastery. The current buildings, including a soaring crossing tower that is a landmark of Cologne's Old Town, were erected between 1150-1250. The architecture of its eastern end forms a triconch or trefoil plan, consisting of three apses around the crossing, similar to that at St. Maria im Kapitol. The church was badly damaged in World War II; restoration work was completed in 1985. Great St. Martin Church in December, 2014 As of 2009 Great Saint Martin is being used by a branch of the Monastic Fraternities of Jerusalem and is open for visits again. History Aerial view of the Great St. Martin Church, Cologne The story of Great St. Martin is inextricably connected to that of the Benedictine abbey, located at the church for most of its history. A few documents from the time of the building have survived, and it is from these that knowledge of its founding comes. This information is also supported by archeological findings onsite and the study of the style of building and its ornamentation. Apocryphal histories The Cologne text Aedidius Gelenius, a catalogue of local saints, mentions in the 1645 edition a possible origin for the church in pre-Carolingian times. The missionaries Viro and Plechelmus, who later were affiliated with the Kaiserswerth cloister, are said to have come to the Rhine, to found monasteries and churches. They were said to be sponsored by Pippen and Plectrudis, situating their work during the years 752-768. It is possible that these two founded a church that would later become Great St. Martin. Theories of the Church‚Äôs pre-Carolingian beginning are supported by the Chronicon Sancti Martini Coloniensis, which up until the end of the 19th century was regarded as a valid historical source for Churches and Abbeys in Cologne. According to it, Great St. Martin was founded as a chapel in 690, and was transformed into a monastery by Viro, Plechelmus and Otger in 708. The Chronicon provides an unbroken history of the abbey and the events leading to its partial destruction by Saxons in 778, while Charlemagne was fighting in Spain. Other events included in this history include a papal visit from Leo III and the damage from the Normans in 846 and 882.Max Hasak: Die Baukunst. 11. Heft: Die Kirchen Gross St. Martin und St. Aposteln in K√∂ln, 1899, page 10 Writing in 1900, Otto Opperman, a scholar in Germany, proved that this chronicle is a false history, concocted by Oliver Legipont, a Benedictine Monk residing at Great St. Martin‚Äôs in 1730.Otto Oppermann, Kritische Studien zur √§lteren K√∂lner Geschichte I. Die F√§lschungen des Oliver Legipont. From the Westdeutsche Zeitschrift f√ºr Geschichte und Kunst. 19 (1900) pages 271‚Äì344. Other theories, including one that suggests the Church was built in Frankish times (during the 5th to 9th centuries) are similarly unsupported by evidence and likely apocryphal. Foundation and building of the monastery in the 10th and 11th Centuries The Lorsch Codex, which provides a more trustworthy source of information, mentions the founding of the church by the Bruno the Great (953-965) as a men‚Äôs choir house in honor of Martin of Tours. Brun also lists the church in his records and mentions the donation of the relics of St. Eliphius, who was the second named patron of the church. These relics were later transferred to Toul.Paul Clemen, Die Kirchlichen Kunstdenkm√§ler der Stadt K√∂ln II, page 354. Later chronicles written by Johann Koelhoff the younger in 1499 mention that Archbishop Warin of Cologne (976-985) had renovated the Church and placed Minnborinus of Cologne in charge of it (see Hiberno-Scottish mission). Ebergar (985-999) wrote that with donations in 989, the Church was transformed into a monastery for Benedictine monks from Ireland. They included Kilian of Cologne (died 1003), Helias of Cologne (died 1040), Aaron Scotus (died 1052), and Molanus (died 1061). During the 11th century, these Irish residents were gradually replaced by local monks. This is due to the fact that archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne was averse to their presence, and applied himself to their removal.Paul Clemen, Die Kirchlichen Kunstdenkm√§ler der Stadt K√∂ln II, page 354. As a result, the last Irish abbot, Arnold of St. Martin's, died there in 1103.Helmut Fu√übroich: Die ehemalige Benediktinerabteikirche Gro√ü St. Martin zu K√∂ln. page 4. The Vita Annonis reports that Archbishop Anno II (1056‚Äì1075) was given a vision by St. Eliphius of two towers at the church, and that this vision was the inspiration for the towers later erected over the east choir. Romanesque rebuilding in the 12th and 13th centuries In 1150, a fire destroyed much of Cologne. The abbey at the site of Great St. Martin was caught in the conflagration, and although the specific damages are not known, it is supposed that the entire Church was destroyed. The Archbishop of Cologne Philipp I. von Heinsberg sanctified the new building in 1172, and the first phase of construction, the tri-apsidal structure was built, with three round apses meeting in the shape of a cross. This is the only element of the church still present today. The eastern end of the nave was completed before a further fire in 1185, as well as aisles on the Southside. At the northern apse, two Benedictine chapels were later added, built over the ruins of the previous abbey buildings. More information concerning the construction comes from the tenure of Abbott Simon (1206‚Äì1211). The abbot‚Äôs brother bequeathed in his final will money towards the purchase of new stone for the abbey, indicating some construction was ongoing.Anton Ditges: Gro√ü St. Martin in K√∂ln. Eine Festschrift zur siebenten S√§cularfeier der Kirchweihe am 1. Mai 1872, page 17. In the middle of the 13th century, new walls for the three apses were completed, with larger windows. These provided a sought-after lightness to the interior. The nave was also made five meters longer, and the atrium in the west was built. Developments from the 14th to 17th century After the completion of the church in the 13th century, few modifications to the form of the church were undertaken. Most significant during this period were the various renovations needed for the four surrounding towers. In 1378, fire destroyed the roofs of the four towers, which were repaired with help from saved financial resources. A strong storm in 1434 provided later troubles. Three of the four gables of the towers were thrown down. One of the gables struck a nearby fish market, two others fell directly onto the vault over the main altar. The vault was later repaired, and a commemorative bell dated with the year 1436 was hung. Reforms under abbots Jakob von Wachendorp (1439‚Äì1454) and Adam Meyer (1454‚Äì1499) provided a stronger financial footing for the Benedictine abbey. From this the inner decoration of the church was embellished, including figures from the altar, installed in 1509, that are still present today. The instable construction of a western flanking tower resulted in the destruction of it and a nearby chapel in 1527. The chapel would later be torn down, and neither it nor the tower was rebuilt. Also during this period, the interior of Great St. Martin was decorated with medieval altars, which would later be replaced with newer furnishings in the 17th century. 18th century Baroque and Classical Influences In 1707, the decaying interior walls of Great Saint Martin were repaired and refurbished, remaining faithful to the previous design of the Church. Heinrich Obladen, then the abbot of Great Saint Martin, also purchased a new, larger organ for the church. New adornments for the Church took on a Baroque style, including golden bands for the pillars, dome and walls, which added to the interior luminescence of the Church.Peter Opladen, Geschichte einer stadtk√∂lnischen Abtei, page 61. In the second half of the 18th century, a number of small changes were made to the interior construction and environment. Abbott Franz Spix, overseeing the abbey in 1741-1759, raised the area of the altar and laid it further back in the apse. His goal was to embellish its appearance for the holy mass. Through these efforts, the old crypt was demolished and the columns and pillars were now prevented from jutting out at their bases.Peter Opladen, Geschichte einer stadtk√∂lnischen Abtei, page 61. Around forty years later, at the end of the 18th century, Ferdinand Franz Wallraf saw that the Church was embellished with new adornments appropriate to the style of the age. Influenced by the beginnings of Classicism, the altar and pulpit took on a new, simpler appearance. The high altar retained its opulence, albeit with a simpler Greco-Roman painting influences. These changes caused controversy with the 19th-century Catholic renewal movement, who said that these parts of the Church‚Äôs adornment should be removed, on the grounds that they were too pagan in theme.Stadtspuren Band 1, Rolf Lauer: Gro√ü St. Martin, page 433. In the late 18th century, the ramshackle northwestern tower was taken down. For this reason, pictures taken before the middle of the 19th century show the church with only two towers on the east side. Secularization and restoration in the 19th century During the French revolutionary era of the 1780s-90s, several territories near France, including Cologne, were captured by the revolutionary army. In October 1794, the city of Cologne was captured and occupied for the next 20 years. This occupation put a definite end to the medieval traditions of the city, and began a strong anti-clerical movement in its place. As a result, the archbishopric in Cologne was ended in 1801, and the Cologne Cathedral was designated as a normal parish church. The cloister at Great Saint Martin was disbanded in 1802, and the remaining 21 monks were obliged to find other places to live. Only 11 would be able to find positions as priests in Cologne. In the following years, Abbott Felix Ohoven would preside over Great Saint Martin as parish priest. Starting in 1808, the deserted abbey building functioned as living quarters for French veterans. It would later be demolished, with the building materials utilized in other parts of the city. In 1843, the city of Cologne dedicated finances to the restoration and recovery of the church. The sacristy was restored in the north apse, following the original designs. Four years later, the building of the two missing towers was begun, initiated by Heinrich Nagelschmidt, who also created a plan for the full restoration of the church. The city of Cologne covered half of the restoration costs, said to be around 32,000 talers. In 1875, Great Saint Martin received a new roof, newly built western gables, a new window in the south wall, and finally, the completion of its two missing towers.Paul Clemen, Die Kirchlichen Kunstdenkm√§ler der Stadt K√∂ln II, page 362. The interior of the church was also restored. August Essenwein, director of the Germanic Museum in Nurnberg, was entrusted with this task, and sought to return the decorative elements to authentic medieval designs. Essenwein knew that achieving his full plans for the interior would not be likely, given resource and time constraints, and therefore drew up conceptual plans for each part of the church. Under his plans, the interior of the church was decorated with a variety of themes from the new and old testaments.Paul Clemen, Die Kirchlichen Kunstdenkm√§ler der Stadt K√∂ln II, page 362. The only remaining major changes to the building in the 19th century occurred in 1892, when the east side of the Basilica was renovated to better show the cloverleaf design of the choir. A new roof of this area was replaced two years later. World War II damage Great Saint Martin's was badly damaged by aerial bombing during World War II. On the night of May 30, 1942, the tower and nave of the church were burnt to the ground. The sacristy building and north apse were also destroyed. In the following year, during one of the heaviest bombardments of the war, the chapel of St. Benedict on the northern side was destroyed.Carl Dietmar, Werner Jung: Kleine illustrierte Geschichte der Stadt K√∂ln. J. P. Bachem Verlag, K√∂ln 2002, page 265. During the bombing of January 1945, the triforiums of all three apses were destroyed. At the same time, the foundation of the central tower sustained a direct hit. In the final bombardment by Allied forces, on March 2, 1945, the city received its heaviest damage. Almost ninety-five percent of the buildings in the old city were damaged, and at Great Saint Martin, all of the ceilings in the church had been destroyed, or very badly damaged.Walter Zimmermann: Neue Beobachtungen zur Baugeschichte von Gro√ü St. Martin in K√∂ln. page 135. Later building and restoration In post-war years, the question of whether the church should be restored, and how it should be restored, was the subject of debate. Should the church be left as a ruined memorial to the war? Or should it be fully restored? And if so, which period in the history of Great Saint Martin represents the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù church? Kirchen in Tr√ºmmern. Zw√∂lf Vortr√§ge zum Thema Was wird aus den K√∂lner Kirchen? Prof. Dr. Otto H. F√∂rster pages 204‚Äì205. A series of public lectures were held in 1946/47, under the theme ‚ÄúWhat happens to the Cologne Churches?‚Äù. These lectures involved artists, politicians, architects and restorers, and mirrored public debates on the issue. In spite of some public scepticism, restoration work began in 1948. By 1954, the walls and supports for the apses of the church, with their dwarf galleries, were completely rebuilt. In 1955, the nave was begun, and was completed with a new roof in 1971. In 1965, the exterior form of the church with its four towers was restored. Between 1982 and 1984, new flooring was laid according to the designs Essenwein made in the 19th century. When the interior restorations were completed in 1985, the church was opened to worshippers, the first such opening in forty years. The altar was consecrated by Archbishop Joseph H√∂ffner, who installed holy relics of Brigitta von Schweden, Sebastianus and Engelbert of Cologne, in its sepulchre. As of 2009, Great Saint Martin Church is being used by a branch of the Monastic Fraternities of Jerusalem and is open for visits again. Archeological Investigation A reconstruction of the appearance of the City of Cologne, as it may have appeared in the 3rd century, with one of the Rhine islands visible in the foreground. Great St Martin‚Äôs is located at the site of one of the original Rhine islands, situated east of the site of the Ancient Roman Praetorium. The island is no longer separate. When the site underneath the church was excavated in the years 1965-66, an investigation revealed that the earliest building dates from the first century,Worlff, Gerta. Das r√∂misch- germanische K√∂ln. 5th Edition. J.P. Bachem, page 242-245. and was 76 meters long and 71.5 meters wide. The inner room was 55.7 by 43.8 meters large, and held a mysterious shallow area used to store water, measuring 34 x 17.2 meters. This is notable because no similar structures from this period, North of the Alps have yet been found. Because no other information about the use of the building has been passed down, only conjectures can be offered as to the function of the pool. One possibility is that the building was used for recreation, and that the water storage area was a swimming pool. It is also possible that the pool was used to store live fish, to keep them fresh. A further theory posits that the site was a sacred Roman precinct or temple.Worlff, Gerta. Das r√∂misch-germanische K√∂ln. 5th Edition. J.P. Bachem, page 242-245. Sometime in the middle of the second century, the pool was filled in, and accompanying buildings to the south, east and west were built. The location of these buildings, directly on the banks of the Rhine, as well as their structure, indicates use as storage, for market goods shipped along the river. The storehouse on the site of the church was used after antiquity. Archeological excavation showed that at three separate times, a new floor was built, always on top of the older material. It is not clear whether any of these renovations stem from Roman or later Medieval periods. However, in one layer of the floor, shards of Pingsdorfer ceramic were discovered, suggesting that it was added during the Carolingian Renaissance.R√∂misch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz: F√ºhrer zu vor- und fr√ºhgeschichtlichen Denkm√§lern, Band 38, K√∂ln II, Exkursionen: N√∂rdliche Innenstadt.

It consists of life legends and miracles performed by Sikh Gurus and historic Sikhs such as Baba Banda Bahadur in 51,820 verses. According to Pashaura Singh ‚Äì a scholar of Sikhism, the text freely borrows from prior mythical stories in Janamsakshis and older Sikh literature such as Bansavalinama, Sikhan di Bhagat Mala, and Mahima Prakash, then embellishes it further. The Suraj Prakash is written in Braj Bhasha language in Gurmukhi script, with significant use of Sanskrit words.Sri Gur Pratap Suraj Granth, Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Volume IV, S‚ÄìZ, Punjabi University, Patiala, page 236 It is organized into \\"seasons\\" and \\"rays\\". It includes Vedantic doctrines of Udasi Sikhs and Nirmala Sikhs. The text also incorporates some ideas of the Hindalis considered heretical by Khalsa Sikhs. This, states Pashaura Singh, may have been the result of the traditional Sikh schools in Amritsar of 18th‚Äì and 19th‚Äìcentury which included Vedanta as a standard part of the Sikh learning. According to W. H. McLeod ‚Äì a historian and Sikhism scholar, the Suraj Prakash contains \\"somewhat higher proportion\\" of Sikh history, but it is mostly ahistorical mythology and untrustworthy source of Sikh history. Max Arthur Macauliffe extensively but selectively used the Suraj Prakash, in cooperation with Kahn Singh Nabha, for his six-volume The Sikh Religion series that presented Sikh scriptures and history to the Western world in early 20th-century. While Macauliffe used it extensively in his Sikh Gurus and history sections, he added that the Suraj Prakash is of doubtful trustworthiness, because the education and heritage of its author Santokh Singh was \\"largely tinctured with Hinduism\\". Suraj Parkash is a popular text in the Sikh community, profusely poetic, and it is sometimes recited in a katha form. The text is a sequel to Santokh Singh's Guru Nanak Prakash, describing the life of the first Guru in 9,700 verses.Santokh Singh Bhai, Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Volume IV, S‚ÄìZ, Punjabi University, Patiala, pages 51‚Äì52 The lives of the Gurus, are divided into twelve Raas or sections. The life of the tenth Guru is presented in six Ruts (literally six seasons), and into two Ayans, the ascending and descending phases of the year. Suraj Parkash was first edited by Bhai Vir Singh over 1926-1935 in 14 volumes, with Punjabi footnotes.

He has beaten a number of world records in multiple age brackets, but none of his times have been ratified as records. His current personal best time for the London Marathon (2003) is 6 hours 2 minutes, and his marathon record, for age 90-plus, is 5 hours 40 minutes at the age of 92, at the 2003 Toronto Waterfront Marathon. Biography Fauja Singh was born in Beas Pind, Jalandhar, Punjab, British India on 1 April 1911, the youngest of four children. Singh did not walk until he was five years old. His legs were thin and weak, and he could hardly walk long distances. Because of this, he was often teased, and he was called by the nickname \\"danda\\" ( for \\"stick\\") for the next ten years. As a young man, Singh was an avid amateur runner, but he gave it up at the time of the Partition of India. It was only after witnessing the death of his fifth son, Kuldip, in a construction accident in August 1994, that Singh returned to his passion for running, in 1995. The death of his wife in 1992, and his eldest daughter who had died from complications after giving birth to his third granddaughter, gave him the determination for this new focus in life. He emigrated to England in the 1990s and lives with one of his sons in Ilford. At 89 years, he took seriously to running and ended up in international marathon events. When he first turned up for training at Redbridge, Essex, he was dressed in a three-piece suit. The coach had to rework everything, including his attire. Singh ran his first race, the London Marathon, in 2000. According to his coach, he used to run up to 20 kilometres easily and wanted to run a marathon, thinking it to be just 26 kilometres and not 26 miles (42 kilometres). It was after he realised this that he began training seriously. At the age of 93, Singh completed a marathon in 6 hours and 54 minutes. This knocked 58 minutes off the previous world best for anyone in the 90-plus age bracket. In 2004, he was featured in an advertising campaign for sportswear manufacturer Adidas alongside David Beckham and Muhammad Ali. Singh holds UK records for the 200 m, 400 m, 800 m, mile and 3000 m for his age group, records all set within a single 94-minute period. At the age of 100, Singh attempted and accomplished eight world age group records in one day, at the special Ontario Masters Association Fauja Singh Invitational Meet, held at Birchmount Stadium in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Timed by officials in Canada, he ran the 100 metres in 23.14, 200 metres in 52.23, the 400 metres in 2:13.48, the 800 metres in 5:32.18, the 1500 metres in 11:27.81, the mile in 11:53.45, the 3000 metres in 24:52.47, and the 5000 metres in 49:57.39, setting five world records for his age group in one day. Some events had no previous record holder, as nobody over age 100 had ever attempted the distance. Some of his marks are significantly superior to the listed world record in the M95 age group as well. Three days later, on 16 October 2011, Singh became the first 100-year-old to finish a marathon, completing the Toronto Waterfront Marathon in 8:11:06. As it took him over 14 minutes after the gun to cross the starting line, the official time submitted for the age group record will be 8:25:17. However, Guinness World Records refused to include Singh in its record book because he could not produce his birth certificate to prove his age. Birth records were not kept in India in 1911. He was however able to produce a passport listing his date of birth as 1 April 1911, and a letter from Queen Elizabeth II congratulating him on his 100th birthday.http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/10/24/fauja-singh-marathon- no-record_n_1028410.html?ir=UK In October 2011, Singh, a vegetarian, became the oldest man to be featured in a PETA campaign. In July 2012, Singh carried the Olympic torch. Singh had stated that he would retire from competitive running after taking part in the Hong Kong marathon on 24 February 2013, five weeks shy of his 102nd birthday. He completed the 10 kilometre run at the Hong Kong marathon in 1 hour 32 minutes and 28 seconds, and said that he intends to continue running for pleasure, health and charity. Singh was awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to sport and charity.2015 New Year Honours List Singh is 1.72 m (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 52 kg (115 lb). He attributes his physical fitness and longevity to abstaining from smoking and alcohol and to following a simple vegetarian diet. He has been quoted as saying \\"I am very careful about different foods. My diet is simple phulka, dal, green vegetables, yogurt and milk. I do not touch parathas, pakoras, rice or any other fried food. I take lots of water and tea with ginger. ... I go to bed early taking the name of my Rabba (God) as I don‚Äôt want all those negative thoughts crossing my mind.\\" Speaking about the marathon, he said: \\"The first 20 miles are not difficult. As for last six miles, I run while talking to God.\\" \\"Sikhs in the City\\" He is the eldest of a group of Sikhs who call themselves \\"Sikhs in the City\\", formed over 10 years ago. There were three other Sikhs, aged 79, 79 and 80, in the \\"Golden Oldies\\" team which ran the Edinburgh Marathon relay in 2009. The SITC running group are a now a well-established team based in East London, running marathons across the world with interfaith groups and raising money for Fauja Singh's charities. Turbaned Tornado His biography, titled Turbaned Tornado, was formally released in the Attlee Room of Britain's House of Lords on 7 July 2011 by Lord Anthony Young of Norwood Green and retired British Crown Court judge Sir Mota Singh.

William Fugazy, the chairman of the coalition, said Singh is a symbol of racial tolerance, and his running helps bridge the gap created by the 11 September terrorist attacks. \\"He is the greatest inspiration,\\" said Fugazy, and added that Singh was the first non-American to receive the honour.Osama Jeers Didn't Stop Sikh Marathon Man, 92, by Austin Fenner Daily News (New York), Friday, 14 November 2003 He was awarded the \\"Pride of India\\" title by a UK-based organisation for his achievements in 2011. Punjab elections 2012 He attended an election rally at village Kukranwala under the Raja Sansi constituency (near Amritsar) for the Punjab People's Party candidate, where he was reported to have extended his support for the party. However, the party was criticized by Sikhs in the City for the \\"misuse of Fauja Singh for political purposes\\", and for having \\"abused the vulnerability of an old man for its own ends\\". Chardikala Run 2012 Fauja Singh was invited as a special guest for the 2nd Annual Chardikala Run in Malaysia. The run was given a theme '101 and running' as a mark of respect for Singh. He was given a warm crowd response and was also presented with The BrandLaureate Award on stage during the closing ceremony. Singh was given a warm response by the people of Malaysia. He was escorted to the Chardikala Charitable Fun Run venue, Astaka in Petaling Jaya, by the Malaysian Bikers Group. Singh flagged off the start of the Marathon. Fauja Singh's attitude was praised especially because he had taken part in the Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon on the same morning, yet was in full spirits meeting, greeting and being a major part of the successful CCFR 2012.

The game runs on Amstrad CPC, BBC model B, Commodore 64 and Sinclair ZX Spectrum. The game is loosely based on the 1983 award-winning children's novel of the same name by Terry Jones. A number of characters and items in the computer game are drawn from the novel, although the plot is completely different. Jones also directed a 1989 movie Erik the Viking, which was also completely different from the novel, featuring a third plot that was different from that of the videogame. England based video game developer Eurocom was working on an NES version of the game which was supposed to be based on the book and the film, however it was ultimately cancelled in late 1992. Plot The player controls Erik the Viking, and it's Erik's task to find his family, who have been kidnapped by the evil Dogfighters. In the first part of the game, Erik is on the mainland. He makes preparations for sailing, finds his weapons and gathers together a crew, who include Blind Thorkhild, Sven the Strong and Ragnar Forkbeard. Most of the game is set on the sea, with Erik steering his ship, the Golden Dragon, through the northern seas. He visits a number of different islands to collect the necessary items and meet the necessary characters to rescue his family and win the game. These include an enchantress in a cave hidden in a forest, the wizard Al Kwasarmi on a stone quay, and the enchanter's daughter Freya. The enchanter's study contains a list of the items that Erik needs to complete the game, and Al Kwasarmi makes them into the ribbon that Erik needs to rescue his family. A dragon may also interrupt Erik's quest! Gameplay The computer game is a text-based adventure, in which the player inputs simple commands which Erik follows. As in similar adventure games, the world is divided into a number of screens or \\"rooms\\", all of which have simple pictures to enhance the atmosphere. The game's graphics were reminiscent of Beam Software's The Hobbit (1982) in that they are seen to be drawn on the screen as Erik enters a new room. The parser, though, was not as advanced at that used in The Hobbit and was unable to handle sentences beyond set phrases. Additionally, the non- player characters did not exhibit the same independence as they did in The Hobbit, nor is it possible to command them to act. However, the dictionary on the parser was respectable for its time and the playability of the game was fairly good. Erik the Viking is difficult to complete with a linear plot typical of adventure games of this era. Omitting to get an object early in the game often meant that a later puzzle cannot be solved. As in other games of the time, it is all too easy to die. For example, at one point in the game the Golden Dragon's sail will start to rip, and you haven't found the needle in the byre by that stage, you will drown. There are a number of particularly challenging and occasionally frustrating puzzles for the gamer. One of the more clever examples includes finding the Enchanter's study. This requires following a particular pattern of moves through seemingly endless corridors of yellow, red and blue rooms. The amusing solution to this is that the colours are political: so a red room requires Erik to move left, a blue room right and a yellow room ahead. At one point, the instruction \\"Knock like Thor\\" requires Erik to use a hammer. The aforementioned needle that Erik uses to mend his sail in found in the unlikeliest of places: a haystack! The misty screens at the sea were very annoying. If the parser cannot recognise a command, the game will respond to the player with one of a number of phrases with which the gamer will be very familiar on completing the game. These include \\"Eh?\\", the response to a nonsense phrase, \\"Try again\\" for a command that is almost recognisable, and \\"Do WHAT to [an object]...\\" if the parser recognises the object in question but not the verb. Entering \\"TALK\\" or \\"SPEAK\\" will cause the response \\"Actions speak louder than words\\". One amusing feature of this is that is always uses the full name of an item, so the command \\"TOUCH STEWPOT\\" would cause the response \\"Do WHAT to a large iron stewpot\\". There are also a number of tempting rooms or locations that look as though they can be visited at sea, but on attempting to visit them the computer responds with \\"The natives won't help\\" or \\"Erik finds nothing but sheep\\". The game had a scoring system out of 1000, and when Erik died a message appeared stating how many points you had scored and giving you a Viking title accordingly, the lowest being Thrall. As with its other adventure games, Level 9 Computing issued a \\"Clue Sheet\\" that could be ordered. This provided gamers with much-needed help to solve some more difficult puzzles.

Organizational details  The Jamboree in Vogelenzang, Bloemendaal in the Netherlands was opened on July 31, 1937 by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, with 28,750 Scouts from 54 countries attending. Given 650 water taps and 120 showers, it was considered the cleanest jamboree to date. The main camp was at Vogelenzang, the Sea Scout camp was at Bennebroek, now both part of the municipality Bloemendaal.Algemeen Handelsblad 18-07-1937 The host site was on the farm of the Vertegaal family.  Symbol  The symbol used for the world jamboree is the Jacob's staff, which was used during the exploration of new territories in the Age of Discovery by Dutch sailors. The ten arms symbolize the ten articles of the Scout Law. After this jamboree, the Jacob's staff became the award of gratitude for the Netherlands Scout organizations. Wooden versions were given to Scouts who had supported the jamboree organization. Later on, the silver and gold Jacob's staff became official awards of gratitude in the Dutch national Scouts organization.  Subcamps  The camp consisted of 12 subcamps, each with its own badge color: * camp 1: yellow * camp 2: green * camp 3: red * camp 4: light-blue * camp 5:dark-blue * camp 6:red/white * camp 7:blue/white * camp 8:yellow/green * camp 9: orange * camp 10: green/white (Woestduin) * camp 11: orange/white (water camp) * camp 12: white (an insigne without stripe) The net results of this stamp was used to pay the trip of the Netherlands East Indies Boy Scouts to the 5th World Scout Jamboree  Girls and Cub Scouts  Although girls did not participate in the jamboree (until the 16th World Scout Jamboree in Australia), they were allowed to give a salute to Olave Baden-Powell, their Chief Guide. Also a special Cub Scout day was organized during the jamboree.

The song is a nostalgic ballad, with di Bari singing to a woman about her childhood, which she gave up by taking a lover at a very young age; and while this action, being a passage into adulthood, made her appear \\"cool\\" before her more innocent peers and transformed her into a self-assured young woman, she did in fact forsake what was - or could have been - \\"the best time\\" of her life.

The station is owned by Green Bay-based Starboard Broadcasting and airs Starboard's Relevant Radio network. The station originally signed on as WKAU in a Top 40 format. In 1984, the station was sold to Quinn Martin of Milwaukee who changed the call letters to his initials, WQWM, and made it an oldies music format. The station changed hands again in 1993 to a new ownership who changed the calls to WSGC and the format to \\"Positive Country\\" music. Another sale in 1999 resulted in the station becoming all-sports \\"1050 The Jock, WJOK,\\" which carried programming from the national Sports Fan Radio Network as well as local broadcasts of Wisconsin Timber Rattlers baseball. WJOK was purchased by Starboard Broadcasting in 2000, and the station joined Starboard's Relevant Radio network on November 26 of that year. Previous incarnations WJOK was also the call sign of a small radio station in Gaithersburg, Maryland, in the early 1980s, broadcasting on the 1150 AM frequency. It was unique at the time for having been the first radio station to broadcast comedy routines from comedy albums recorded by Bob Newhart, Bill Cosby, Eddie Murphy and older radio programs such as \\"The Great Gildersleeve\\" and \\"Baby Snooks\\". Lesser known, older artists were also aired such as Shelley Berman, Henny Youngman, Hudson & Landry and the Duck's Breath Mystery Theater. Music by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic was commonly played. From 10:00 PM until its midnight sign-off, the station featured \\"Unexporgated Comedy\\", material containing profanity and indecent language. The disc jockeys of WJOK provided patter in between selections and played interactive radio games with the audience for prizes such as tickets to comedy shows at comedy clubs in Washington, DC, including the Comedy Cafe and Garvin's, a comedy club chain with three branches at its height. DJs included Brad Krantz, \\"Uncle Walt\\", Evan Haining weekdays, Eddie Katz, Steve Willett and the syndicated Dr. Demento Show. Some recurrent listeners (notably redneck \\"Jee-im (Jim) from Poolesville\\") were integrated into some games. WJOK went off the air due to insufficient growth in ratings. A very weak signal (1000 watts during the day, 500 watts at night), was partially to blame and no other format lasted longer before the station was permanently closed. WJOK began broadcast before comedy cable TV stations such as HA! went on the air, followed by the successful establishment of Comedy Central.

On November 19, 1899, lessons began for the first seven pupils.History . Friedensau Adventist University. Retrieved 2009-08-05 Within the next ten years, a collection of large school buildings and living quarters emerged on the campus that still stand today and are local landmarks synonymous with Friedensau. Based on a holistic pedagogic concept, a sanatorium, workshops and a health-food factory were added, providing opportunities for both practical work experience and income for the pupils at the same time. In this way, Friedensau grew quickly to become a Missions and Industrial School which was visited by up to 250 pupils each year until the First World War. During the First World War, the War Department set up a military hospital in the buildings. It was not until 1919 that training could be resumed once more. In the following years, new courses were offered (home economics, preparation for nurses' training, 10th grade secondary education, business and child care). In 1923, the school was renamed to \\"Mission Seminary Friedensau\\". In 1930, the seminary was awarded state approval for courses in home economics and business by the chief administrator of the government for the region of Magdeburg. The Nazi-era brought many restrictions, and finally the school was again closed during the Second World War. Once more, the buildings served for the care of wounded and sick soldiers, first for the German Wehrmacht and then for the Soviet Army. Through recommendations from the then Minister-President of Saxony-Anhalt, Erhard Huebener, the Soviet military administration permitted the Seminary to reopen in 1947. This made Friedensau the first church-run educational institute in the Soviet occupation zone that was allowed to resume educational activity. During the DDR-regime, the socialist government only allowed for the training of church employees. Besides the training of ministers, the seminary offered one-year social welfare work training programs. The nature and quality of such training resulted in another name change, \\"Theological Seminary Friedensau\\". Two years later, the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists accredited the Seminary as a senior college. At this time it was once more possible for Friedensau to offer training to students from other socialist states in Eastern Europe and Africa to become pastors. On September 15, 1990, the Theological Seminary received the status of a state-recognized university following a resolution from the DDR Council of Ministers. Since then, in addition to the Theological Faculty (which has been offering a Diploma in Theology since 1992), a Christian Social Science Faculty has been established. Presently, besides the Diploma and Bachelor's courses in Theology and Christian Social Work, Master's programmes in Theology, Counseling, Social Work, and International Social Sciences (International Development) can also be taken as well as a preparatory course for musical studies. From late 2008 on, Friedensau is the first institution to offer a concentration in Adventist Studies at the Master's level. Further degrees, for example in Music Therapy, started in 2011.

He was almost certainly a native of Bristol, England, and travelled to Newfoundland in 1610 as one of the first settlers in a scheme for the plantation of Newfoundland. They settled at Cuper's Cove and the colony was governed by John Guy, another Bristol man. Some authorities claim that Colston was Guy's brother-in-law, though this is uncertain. John Guy appointed Colston as deputy governor during his absence from the colony between August 1611 and June 1612, and Colston kept the required journal of weather and what the settlers were doing throughout the winter, though this journal has not survived. After Guy returned from England, with 16 women settlers, cattle and a chaplain, he is reported to have sent Colston home to England for a holiday. Back in Bristol, Colston told John Slany, treasurer of the London and Bristol Company who sponsored the Cuper's Cove colony, of the vast riches to be had in Newfoundland. Other authorities claim that he remained longer in Cuper's Cove, and that Colston recorded the first birth of an English child in the settlement on 27 March 1613, when Nicholas Guy and his wife had a baby boy. Prowse claims that Guy abandoned Newfoundland in 1613, and left Colston in charge of the colony.

It is in close proximity to the town of Innisfail. Innisfail is situated south of Cairns and north of Townsville. The bay is bounded by Cooper's point in the north and Heath's point in the south. The land area adjacent to Ella Bay is named Wanjuru. At the landscape scale, the mountain ranges encircling Ella Bay itself lie mostly within the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, recognised for its natural heritage. Parts of Ella Bay are protected within the Ella Bay National Park. The ocean directly offshore at Ella Bay lies within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which is also the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. There are two blocks of private land at the southern end of Ella Bay, a predominantly cleared 470 hectare block and a 65 acre rainforest block named Little Cove by property developer Satori Ella Bay. The average annual rainfall at Innisfail is over 3,500 mm or 3.5 m according to the Bureau of Meteorology, and the average number of rainy days per year is 150 days.  History  The Ella Bay area was originally inhabited by the Bagirbarra clan, the recognised Traditional Owners of the Ella Bay land and one of the Mamu speaking clan groups of the Innisfail region.Pentecost, P.M. (2007) Report on a cultural heritage assessment on Lot 30 on Crown Plan N157629, North Queensland. Unpublished report to The Mamu People and Ella Bay Developments, Brisbane. The richness and diversity of the Wet Tropics lowland rainforest environment, would have allowed for a population density of approximately two km2 per person and a 'band' of approximately 50 individuals. Ella Bay lies within the traditional country of the Mamu peoples, an Australian Aboriginal tribe with a number of distinctive clan groups. These clan groups have cultural and spiritual ties to coastal lowlands, coastal lands and waters within what is now known as the northern part of the Cassowary Coast region of north eastern Queensland, Australia. Before colonisation, Mamu people moved seasonally within their traditional country, accessing and using important food sources including seafoods, freshwater fish, game animals, rainforest fruits and roots. Certain plant species used by rainforest Aboriginal tribes in this area on a regular basis are highly toxic, and careful preparation using time honoured methods were employed to make these food sources safe for eating. During particular seasons, these toxic foods would form a staple of the tribes' diets. In some locations, early European visitors (for example the anthropologist Roth) recorded seeing communal settlements with multiple shelters including long-house type structures, and there is evidence that a taro-type species of yam was cultivated for regular harvest along creeks and rivers. Like so many Aboriginal people in Australia, many Mamu traditional owners were forcibly removed from their traditional lands to other places in Queensland including Cherbourg, Woorabinda, Yarrabah and Palm Island mission settlements. Some have come back to live in the area since the mid-20th century. First contact with Europeans came with a handful of survivors from the wreck of the brig Maria. On the 26th of February 1872, after astounding escapes from reef and rocks, the brig ran onto what is still known as the Maria reef, some miles off Cardwell. All the men who got ashore via raft north of the Johnstone River owed their lives to the local aboriginals, who treated them kindly, fed and made camps for them, and signaled the rescue boat Basilisk to come ashore.The World'S News Saturday October 13, 1923.

The first settlers were the \\"cedar getters\\" in 1880 during the influx of timber cutters after the local red cedar species (Toona ciliata), quickly followed by becoming a key growing area for bananas and sugar cane. The later industries persist into the present day.

Major damage to homes and other buildings was caused by Larry as well as extensive damage to local crops (tropical fruits, sugar and bananas) and timber plantations. Flora and fauna The Ella Bay area is home to a large variety of plant and animal life including iconic species like the endangered southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius johnsonii), endangered and vulnerable frog species including the Australian lace-lid, common mist frog and waterfall frog, remnant native plants and estuarine crocodiles. Ella Bay is regularly used by green sea turtles as a nesting site. Other threatened marine turtles may nest in this area though this has yet to be confirmed. The waters off Ella Bay are important shallow water habitat for coastal dolphin species including the endemic snub fin dolphin and the Indo-pacific humpback dolphin. Whales have been observed at Ella Bay including migrating humpback whales. Dugong have been observed at Ella Bay though the poor condition of seagrass beds in the area currently make this area less than optimal Dugong habitat.  Ella Bay development  The Ella Bay property comprises 470 hectares of freehold land used as a cattle station that is isolated within the Ella Bay National Park and Wet Tropics of Queensland and a 160 acre rainforest block named Little Cove. The Ella Bay site was first surveyed in 1882 and large areas of the site were later cleared for banana production and small crop farming. There are numerous newspaper reports from the early 1900s of Ella Bay being one of the major banana growing areas in Queensland.Brisbane Courier. 1903Sydney Morning Herald. 1906Rockhampton Morning Bulletin 1903 The newspaper articles report that the land was leased to Chinese farmers and there were over 100 men working the site, that 500 acres had been cleared for bananas and there was a 340 ft long jetty built in 1902 to load steamers with bananas to Brisbane. There was a note of Ella Bay Road (tender for bridge, Cairns Post 1917). In 1906, this settlement of over 100 Chinese farmers was abandoned after a severe tropical cyclone destroyed their homes and crops. After selling any rescued fruit the Chinese farmers totally abandoned Ella Bay and the area was never resettled. In recent history, most of the Ella Bay site was shown as cleared in Army MappingAccessed via Department of Environment and Resource Management: Museum of Lands, Mapping and Surveying. September 2009 dated 1943 and the small amount of remaining areas were cleared and levelled in the mid 1960s. Since that time the site has been used mainly for pastoral purposes. Introduced tropical pasture grass (Brachiaria decumbens and Brachiaria humidicola) covers almost all of the cleared area. The 470 hectare site is mostly cleared. Introduced weed infestation (Pond apple, Hymenachne, Sicklepod etc.) have further degraded much of these pasture areas and the margins of remnant vegetated areas and this situation has been brought about by a failure of successive property owners to control these invasive weed species in a timely and efficient manner. The 160 acre Little Cove property is covered almost entirely with endangered and of concern rainforest vegetation. Under Commonwealth EPBCA legislation Littoral rainforest is listed as Critically Endangered. This land is situated in the southern section of Ella Bay as the northern area was too wet for agriculture. The northern wetland known as Ella Bay Swamp is classified as a wetland of national significance and is primarily located within Ella Bay National Park. It is proposed to construct the Ella Bay Integrated Resort; an integrated resort and property development focusing on sustainability, and environmental stewardship. The stated ecological goal of the development is to first, live sustainably with the minimum carbon footprint, rainwater harvesting and recycling of water and minimising pollution, through the general philosophy of ecological living and principles of sustainable development; and second to protect and enhance the fauna and flora of the site and surrounds through responsible use and protection of the natural environment, through conservation and sustainable practices. The project was approved by the Federal Government on 19 December 2012 with 19 conditions designed to reduce environmental impacts. The road to the resort will have to be fenced and have crossing to protect cassowaries. 50 hectares of habitat re-vegetation is to occur onsite. Opposition Local conservationists strongly oppose this urban development/resort complex for many reasons. The influx of up to 5,000 people into this wilderness area is feared to have the potential to cause great harm to this refuge area. Associated traffic into this area will threaten the safety of endangered southern cassowaries and endangered frog species. Critically endangered coastal rainforest will be destroyed to provide access to the property development and to clear sites for 100 residences at the Little Cove development site. Conservationist Russell Constable from the Cassowary Coast Alliance is concerned that coastal dolphin species, which are already threatened, will be adversely impacted by increased boat and jet ski activity from the areas new residents, as will nesting marine turtles. Conservationists also claim it is unwise to place so many people in area that is so susceptible to the impacts of tropical cyclones and has a history of such disasters.

The Napa River-Napa Creek Flood Protection Project is a Civil Works project of the US Army Corps of Engineers in the city of Napa, California. The Project area includes some 6 miles (10 km) of the Napa River from the Butler Bridge on State Route 29 on the south to Trancas Street on the north. This section is the upper reach of the estuary portion of the Napa River and as such is tidally influenced. The Project also includes improvements to 1 mile (1.6 km) of Napa Creek, the primary tributary to the Napa River. The project is cited as a new way of thinking about flood control due to its \\"living river\\" principles. History of Napa River flooding The Napa River runs some 55 miles (89 km) from Mt. St. Helena to San Pablo Bay and drains a watershed of about 426 square miles (1100 km¬≤). The river is prone to seasonal flooding from November through April each year. Flooding that threatens lives and property occurs from the city of St. Helena south through the City of Napa. Recorded history indicates there have been at least 22 serious floods on the Napa River since 1865. The most serious recent floods occurred in 2005, 1997, 1995, and 1986. Process of project approval The US Congress authorized a flood protection project in the City of Napa in 1965 but no funding was provided. Needing matching funds at the local level to gain federal funding, local officials attempted to gain voter support twice in the 1970s but tax measures failed. A severe flood in 1986 regenerated interest and the Army Corps of Engineers was petitioned to reactivate the project. Nine years later, they presented a plan design to the local sponsor, the Napa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District. This design was not well received, as it relied on traditional flood control measures including straightening the main channel and constructing high floodwalls. Napa City Councilmember Cindy Watter described the COE design as a \\"gulag.\\" Environmental organizations and regulatory agencies were concerned that the proposed project would increase sediment transport and negatively impact native species, including the anadromous steelhead trout. Locals were concerned that the project would reduce access to the river for recreation and inhibit economic development. The Community Coalition Local politicians and interest groups could not support the COE design as presented. Rather than submit it to voters for certain defeat, an ad hoc Community Coalition formed with the intent of re-working the design into a project with a chance of success. With the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Napa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District hoping to find a workable solution, a series of meetings involving some 25 agencies and 400 individuals took place over a two-year span. Groups taking key roles in the Community Coalition included Friends of the Napa River, Napa Valley Economic Development Corporation, Napa County Resource Conservation District, Napa Chamber of Commerce, San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board, California Department of Fish and Game, Sierra Club, Napa Downtown Merchants, and the Flood Plain Business Coalition (also known as the \\"Red Zone Rangers\\"). After a prolonged period of design and redesign, a proposition called to fund the plan with a one half cent sales tax called Measure A was placed on the ballot for the county's voters in March 1998. Needing two-thirds support, the measure passed by a margin of 308 votes out of more than 27,000 ballots cast. Yountville was the only city to vote above the 66 2/3%. Their voting carried the passage of the proposition. Living river principles Major objectives of the living river design include reconnecting the river to its historic flood plain, maintaining the natural slope and width of the river, allowing the river to meander as much as possible, retaining natural channel features like mud flats, shallows and sandbars, and supporting a continuous fish and riparian corridor along the river. How it works The average annual flow of the Napa River is about through the populated center of the City of Napa. During a 100-year flood, the flow increases to an estimated to . The Napa River-Napa Creek Flood Protection Project employs a combination of traditional and innovative approaches to reduce the flooding threat. In the downstream project area, dikes have been removed and tidal marshalands have been restored; bridges have been replaced to remove obstacles to water flow; riverbank terracing has been done to provide more room for large volumes of water; a dry bypass channel will be excavated to create a shortcut for fast moving floodwaters to pass through the Oxbow area; new dikes, levees and floodwalls will be built; bank stabilization will be used in specific areas; and detention basins and pump stations will accommodate runoff behind the floodwalls. After much lobbying, work on the Napa Creek portion on the project started in November 2010. This portion of the project was undertaken to control potential flooding in an area along Napa Creek between Jefferson Street and the Napa River in downtown Napa. This area is even more prone to flooding than the river itself. Work in this portion of the project included removal and replacement of existing vehicle bridges, installation of new culvert and reshaping of the creek's bank. Much of this portion of the project was completed in 2013. The project has also funded other river related projects up valley from the work being done in the City of Napa. The remaining work on the project included construction of a flood bypass channel which was finished in 2015.http://www.countyofnapa.org/Pages/DepartmentContent.aspx?id=4294968278 Flood project schedule Funding and Controversy Revenues from the 1998 voter approved Measure A half cent sales tax have exceeded expectations and the United States Congress and the California State Legislature have supplemented funding on an intermittent basis with appropriations during the life of the project. In December 2009, United States Senators John McCain and Tom Coburn criticized a $54 million appropriation for replacing two existing railroad trestle bridges over the river with higher ones. The money in the appropriation was part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Replacement of these bridges were part of the project's original plan and the $85 million contract for the work was awarded to the Alaska native corporation Suulutaaq Inc. McCain and Coburn included the appropriation on a list of 100 ‚Äúwasteful or silly\\" projects in their 2009 ‚ÄúStimulus Checkup‚Äù report. The bridges are utilized by the privately owned Napa Valley Wine Train. An official spokesman for the City of Napa along with several elected officials accused McCain and Coburn of political grandstanding for including the funding in their report. In 2011, the price of the project was projected to reach $440 million by completion. The half cent sales tax is due to expire in 2018. In early 2012, the Army Corps of Engineers announced that it was allocating $1.3 million to continue federal supervision of the work currently funded on the project which is scheduled for completion in 2013. The project will need additional federal funding of $20 million in order to proceed with construction of a flood control channel that will carry 50% of river flow during potential flooding conditions. Lack of funding could potentially delay completion of the project until 2018. The Obama Administration's proposed 2012 -2013 proposed budget released on February 13. 2012 included no funding allocation for the project. While the Army Corps of Engineers considered their work on the project complete in 2015 following the building of the bypass channel between Veteran's Park and the Oxbow district, Napa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District officials have asked them to continue with other work along the river in order to protect 2000 additional parcels from flooding. This work consists of additional flood walls in the Oxbow district along with other flood walls north and south of downtown Napa and building a pump station at the bypass. The measure A half cent sales tax expired on June 30, 2018. While much of the project's original objectives have been completed, others still remain.

It appeared in installments on the web site of Big Head Press. Written by science fiction novelist L. Neil Smith with Rex F. May (better known as the cartoonist Baloo) and illustrated by artist Scott Bieser, with coloring by Jen Zach and lettering by Zeke Bieser, Roswell, Texas is an alternate history set in a universe in which Davy Crockett survived the Alamo and Santa Anna didn't, and in which an expanded Texas eventually became the \\"Federated States of Texas\\" rather than one of the United States. The novel's plot centers around the 1947 crash of an unidentified flying object (analogous to the \\"real-world\\" Roswell UFO incident) near Roswell, the westernmost city of the Federated States of Texas (analogous to the real-world town of Roswell, New Mexico). Its theme incorporates Smith's well-known libertarian philosophy and sensibilities. Outside of North America, other differences between our timeline and this one exist. World War II (known as the \\"European War\\" in this universe) is still being fought into the late 1940s, without Japanese or American involvement. The United Kingdom has allied with Nazi Germany, with King Edward VIII becoming a puppet ruler. Many European people have emigrated to Texas. The United States have suspended the Bill of Rights. California never joined the Union, becoming an independent state like Texas in the novel. Roswell, Texas makes extensive use of anachronism and anatopism in its story line. Historical personalities including Charles Lindbergh (and his son, Charles Lindbergh III, who in real life was abducted and murdered as an infant), Audie Murphy, Malcolm X, Pope John Paul II, Gene Roddenberry, Eliot Ness, Lawrence of Arabia, Charles de Gaulle, Walt Disney and others appear in roles often tangentially related to, but always significantly different from, their \\"real-world\\" biographies. Additionally, characters from Smith's other works (notably William \\"Win\\" Bear, protagonist of The Probability Broach and other novels in Smith's \\"North American Confederacy\\" series) appear in key or supporting roles as \\"alternate history\\" versions of their own fictional selves. As of March 18, 2008, Roswell, Texas was complete at 640 pages‚Äîsome consisting of a single illustration, others of multiple panels. In June 2008, a gray-scale paperback reprint of Roswell, Texas was published by Big Head Press.

After Savarese returned to Italy, he designed a folding stool. Once those went into production, he began designing other pieces. Savarese met his wife, Monique, at Milan's Domus Academy. The two were married in 1987, and together they began to design contemporary furniture distinct from the spare or historical aesthetics popular in the late 1980s. Savarese and his wife designed pieces that reinterpreted classical styles and used vibrant colors. The couple's designs were praised at the first International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York City. They began producing furniture at a factory in The Bronx and opened a retail store on Broome Street in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood. That store, Dialogica, was one of the first retailers in SoHo to feature contemporary furniture designs. The store later expanded to Los Angeles.

He was the long-standing head of conservation at the Thula Thula game reserve in Zululand, South Africa, and the Founder of The Earth Organization, a privately registered, independent, international conservation and environmental group with a strong scientific orientation. He was an international member of the esteemed Explorers Club of New York and a member of the National Council of the Southern Africa Association for the Advancement of Science, South Africa's oldest scientific association. Anthony had a reputation for bold conservation initiatives, including the rescue of the Baghdad Zoo at the height of the US- led Coalition invasion of Iraq in 2003, and negotiations with the infamous Lord's Resistance Army rebel army in Southern Sudan, to raise awareness of the environment and protect endangered species, including the last of the Northern White Rhinoceros. Details of his conservation activities appeared regularly in regional and international media including CNN, CBS, BBC, Al Jazeera and Sky TV and featured in magazines and journals such as Readers Digest, the Smithsonian, the Explorers Journal, Africa Geographic, Men's Journal, Shape magazine, Elle magazine and others. Anthony died of a heart attack at the age of 61 before his planned March 2012 conservation gala dinner in Durban to raise international awareness for the rhino-poaching crisis and to launch his new book, The Last Rhinos: My Battle to Save One of the World's Greatest Creatures.Hamba kahle, Lawrence Anthony the Elephant Whisperer. Conservation News. Wednesday, 7 March 2012 13:22 Following his death, there were reports that some of the elephants he worked to save came to his family's home in accordance with the way elephants usually mourn the death of one of their own. Biography Anthony was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. In the 1920s, his grandfather, who was a miner in Berwick-upon-Tweed, England had migrated to the area to work in the gold mines. His father, who ran an insurance business, went about establishing new offices across Southern Africa; Anthony was raised in rural Rhodesia (now called Zimbabwe), Zambia, and Malawi, before settling in Zululand, South Africa. Following his father, Anthony also started his career in the insurance sector, though subsequently started working the real estate development business. Meanwhile, he started working with Zulu tribespeople, by mid-1990s, his passion for the African Bush inspired him to switch careers, when he bought the Thula Thula game reserve, spread over 5,000-acre in KwaZulu-Natal starting his career as a conservationist. A turning point in career came when he was called by a conservation group to rescue a group of nine elephants who had escaped their enclosure and were wreaking havoc across Northern Mpumalanga,The Elephant Whisperer and were about to be shot. He tried to communicate with the matriarch of the herd through the tone of his voice and body language, eventually rescued them and brought to the reserve, and in time came to be known as \\"Elephant-whisperer\\". In the following years, he established a conservation group, The Earth Organization in 2003, and his efforts lead to the establishment of two new reserves, the Royal Zulu Biosphere in Zululand and the Mayibuye Game Reserve in Kwa Ximba, aimed at providing local tribe people income through wildlife tourism. Anthony was married to Francoise Malby and lived on the Thula Thula game reserve in Zululand. He has two sons (Dylan and Jason) and two grandsons. After his death, a group of wild elephants which he had helped rescue and rehabilitate walked up to his home on their own, and stood around in an apparent vigil for two days, before dispersing. In April, 2012, he was posthumously awarded honorary Doctor of Science degree by College of Agriculture, Engineering and Science, University of KwaZulu-Natal. Baghdad Zoo A tiger cub at the Baghdad Zoo, which Anthony helped rescue, being given a medical check-up by US Army Doctors Baghdad Zoo was the biggest zoo in the Middle East; however, by 8 days after the 2003 invasion, when Anthony reached the zoo on a private rescue initiative, out of the original 700 animals in the Baghdad Zoo only 35 survived owing to bombing of the zoo, looting of the animals for food, and starvation of the caged animals without food and water. Anthony could not get to the zoo any earlier at the height of the war owing to safety, transport and bureaucracy issues. The animals that survived tended to be the larger animals, including bears, hyenas, lions and tigers. In the chaos of the war, Anthony used mercenaries to help protect the zoo, and looked after the animals with the help of some of the zookeepers, feeding the carnivores by buying donkeys on the streets of Baghdad. US Army soldiers, Iraqi civilians and various other volunteers including former Republican Guard soldiers came to assist. Eventually L. Paul Bremer, then head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, supported the zoo and American engineers helped to reopen it. Anthony wrote a book about the wartime rescue of the Baghdad Zoo, and the movie rights have been acquired by a major Hollywood production company. African conservation As an African Wildlife expert, Anthony was long involved with programs to involve remote African tribes in conservation on their own traditional land, an activity he considered essential to the future well-being of conservation in Africa. He had created two new Game Reserves in South Africa. The Royal Zulu Biosphere in Zululand, which is expanding to join the world-famous Umfolozi Hluhluwe reserve, and the Mayibuye Game Reserve in Kwa Ximba. Anthony's private focus was the rehabilitation of traumatized African elephant. He had developed a unique relationship with a wild herd of elephant on the Thula Thula Reserve in Zululand. Anthony's second book, The Elephant Whisperer, tells the story of his working relationship with the African elephant. Anthony had served on the National Transitional Executive Committee during the South African Governments transition from Apartheid on the panel for the electronic media which appointed the Board of Directors of the South African Broadcasting Corporation and on the committee which appointed the Film Board of South Africa. Books Anthony is a bestselling author and his books have been translated into several languages. His brother- in-law, Graham Spence co-authored his three books. Anthony's first book Babylon's Ark, published by Thomas Dunne Books, is the true story of the wartime rescue of the Baghdad Zoo. Babylon's Ark has won literary awards including the Booklist Editors Choice in the category adult books for young adults, and the French 28th Prix Litt√©raire 30 millions d'amis literary award, popularly known as the Goncourt for animals. Anthony's second book, The Elephant Whisperer, published by Pan Macmillan, tells the story of his adventures and relationship with a rescued herd of African elephants. Anthony's third book, The Last Rhinos, published by Sidgwick & Jackson, is the true story of Anthony's involvement to rescue the remaining Northern White rhinoceros in the DR Congo.

He was reluctant to confer citizenship as he reasoned that there ‚Äúwas much force in the argument that the Congress which framed the original act for naturalization of aliens ...intended it to include only white persons belonging to the races whose emigrants had contributed to the building up on this continent of the community of people which declared itself a new nation ...\\" Lacombe only gave Balsara citizenship on the hope that the United States Attorney would indeed challenge his decision and appeal it to create ‚Äúan authoritative interpretation‚Äù of the law. As Lacombe felt if, the definition of ‚Äòfree white persons‚Äô was to be extended ... it... [would] bring in, not only the Parsee.,‚Ä¶ which is probably the purest Aryan type, but also Afghans, Hindoos, Arabs, and Berbers.‚Äù The United States Attorney adhered to Lacombe‚Äôs wishes and took the matter to the Court of Appeals in 1910. The Court of appeal agreed that Parsees belong to the white race and were \\"as distinct from Hindus as are the English who dwell in India‚Äù. Later career and death Following his retirement from the federal bench, Lacombe resumed private practice in New York City from 1916 to 1924. He served as a Referee in Chancery in New York City in 1919. He died on November 28, 1924, in New York City. He was interred in Evergreen Cemetery in Morristown, New Jersey. Conspiracy theory Lacombe wrote a letter to the New York Times advancing a conspiracy theory about the German sinking of the RMS Lusitania in 1915. His letter was published Monday, October 22, 1917, on page 14 titled \\"A NEW THEORY OF THE LUSITANIA SINKING.

In 1258, Jev√≠ƒçko received its city charter, from Ottokar, then ruler of Moravia. In 1291, his son Wenceslaus II gave Jev√≠ƒçko jurisdiction over the thirteen surrounding villages. A Jewish community was founded in Jev√≠ƒçko in the 17th century. In 1848 about 980 Jews lived in the town; by 1910 their number had dropped to just over 200.

The unrehearsed program, sponsored at one point by Colgate-Palmolive, was created by veteran vaudevillian \\"Senator\\" Edward Hastings Ford, who claimed he was taking part in a joke session at a New York theatrical club when he conceived the idea. However, the format was quite similar to a prior joke-telling radio series, Stop Me If You've Heard This One (1939‚Äì40), which featured Ford and cartoonist Harry Hershfield as panelists. Many jokes involved ethnic humor told in dialect. Listeners contributed approximately 3,000 jokes a week. Host Peter Donald told the best of these jokes, each one centered on a different topic, while a \\"laugh meter\\" took note of the audience reaction. The \\"Knights of the Clown Table\\" ‚Äì Ford, Hershfield and Joe Laurie Jr. ‚Äì attempted to top listeners with their own jokes, which sometimes presented an extra challenge as their jokes had to be pertinent to the topic. Any submission used on the program received ten dollars. Each time a panelist failed to top Peter Donald's joke (as registered on the laugh meter which went as high as 1000), an additional five dollars was added, so a listener could potentially win as much as $25, though on many occasions Donald's jokes would score perfect 1000s which would guarantee the top prize to the submitter regardless of how the rest of the panel fared. Further, listeners were also given phonograph recordings of Peter Donald telling their jokes on the air. The panelists claimed that together they knew over 15,000 jokes. Can You Top This? debuted on New York's WOR radio in 1940. NBC picked up the show in 1942, and it continued 12 more years. Hosts at one time or another included Peter Donald, Ward Wilson, Roger Bower and Dennis James. Television Can You Top This? made its first television debut on ABC on October 3, 1950 but only lasted until March 26, 1951. This version featured Ward Wilson as host and Ford, Hershfield, and Laurie as panelists. The show was briefly revived in syndication by Four Star Television on January 26, 1970 with Wink Martindale as host and featured Morey Amsterdam as Executive Producer and a regular panelist, but this incarnation lasted just eight months. In this version, one celebrity (such as Dick Gautier, Louie Nye and Richard Dawson) reads jokes submitted by viewers, while a group of panelists (such as Amsterdam, Red Buttons, Paul Winchell and Jack Carter) try to top the viewer's jokes with their own version on the same subject. The viewer would earn $25 for having the joke read by the guest, an additional $25 for each panelist that was unable to top the viewer's joke, and $100 and a nice prize (such as an Ampex audio cassette player) if he/she topped all three panelists.Schwartz, David. The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows, Third Edition, pp. 33‚Äì34. Checkmark Books, 1999. . The 1970 version was recorded at CBS Television City in Hollywood, California. Studios 31, 33, 41 and 43 were used at different times making it one of the few game shows to tape in all four studios at CBS. Episode status At least 36 episodes exist of the radio show, two of which can be heard below. Eight episodes exist of the 1970 version; one is held by collectors, while the rest are at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. UCLA also has three radio episodes. The December 5, 1947 episode was rebroadcast by KCRW on February 25, 1995. The December 12 show was rerun by KJQI on February 23, 1995. The third is a general 1948 episode with Dennis James. Books The jokes were compiled into two book collections, Can You Top This? and Cream of the Crop, published by Grosset & Dunlap and Dell in 1947 and 1949.
