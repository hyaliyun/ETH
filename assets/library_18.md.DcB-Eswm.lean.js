It was built in 1931, and is the only Christian church in the United States designed to look like a 16th-century Japanese castle.  History  In 1903, Takie Okumura, a pastor from Japan, left his congregation at the Honolulu Japanese Christian Church (now the Nuuanu Congregational Church) to start the Aiy≈´ kai. On April 8, 1904, Takie Okumura founded the Makiki Church, but there wasn't an actual building until a few years later. In 1905, George Castle, a local businessman, donated a plot of land to the church so that they could build the actual church, which was built in 1906. It could hold up to 500 people. In 1927, after the existing church building had been infested by termites, the congregation decided to buy another plot of land and build another church. This became the \\"Castle Church\\", which still exists today. The church was modeled after the Kochi castle in Kochi prefecture, Japan, where Okumura was from. Okumura chose the design to symbolize peace and protection, though at the time it was criticized because it was misunderstood to represent militarism. Hego Fuchino was the architect who created the plans for the church. It is the only church in the United States that has been designed to look like an Edo period Japanese castle. The new church was dedicated on November 6, 1932. In 1936, a dining hall and classrooms were added to the building. The Christian Education building was built in 1960.

Ivaska's research concentrates on cell surface receptors called integrins and how these affect to cancer cell migration, invasion, tumour-stroma crosstalk and other processes that promote cancer progression. Research aims to find novel regulators for integrin activity, understanding the integrin traffic, and link between integrin activity regulation and mechanosensing.

He was one of the most prominent \\"red capitalists\\", a title bestowed on him by Premier Zhou Enlai. He founded Modern Chemical Works in the 1940s and served as Founding Chairman of China Everbright Group in the 1980s. His sister Wang Guangmei was the wife of President Liu Shaoqi, and for that connection he was persecuted and imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, when Liu was ousted by Chairman Mao Zedong. Wang was rehabilitated after Mao's death and served as Vice Chairperson of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and Vice Chairperson of the National People's Congress (NPC).  Early life and career  Wang was born August 1919 into a family of officials in Beijing, Republic of China. His father Wang Huaiqing () was educated in Japan and served in the Beiyang government. His mother Dong Jieru () was from a wealthy and progressive family. Three of her family members were executed in 1928 together with Li Dazhao, co-founder of the Communist Party of China. Wang Guangying was the sixth of 11 children (including three half-siblings), two years older than Wang Guangmei. He studied at the Department of Chemistry of Fu Jen Catholic University of Beijing and graduated in 1943. Soon afterwards he and a friend founded the Modern Chemical Works in Tianjin. It was during World War II, when much of China, including Tianjin, was under Japanese occupation. Machinery and materials were hard to come by, and Wang had to improvise and innovate to keep the factory running. He also started Tianjin Knitwear Factory.  Early People's Republic of China  After the Communist Party won the Chinese Civil War and established the People's Republic of China in 1949, the new government began nationalizing the economy. Wang was cooperative in the process and remained manager of his factories, which were now owned by the state. In 1957, Wang was invited to a banquet Premier Zhou Enlai held for the Soviet leader Kliment Voroshilov, at which Zhou introduced Wang to Voroshilov as a \\"red capitalist\\", likely the first time the term was used in public. During the Cultural Revolution, he was severely persecuted for his relations with President Liu Shaoqi, the husband of Wang's sister Guangmei. Liu, denounced by Mao Zedong as China's \\"No. 1 Capitalist Roader\\", was ousted and died in prison in 1969. Wang Guangying was imprisoned for eight years.  Post-Cultural Revolution  Wang was politically rehabilitated after the Cultural Revolution and was appointed Vice Mayor of Tianjin in 1979, serving until 1982. When Deng Xiaoping began the reform and opening era, Wang's business background became valuable again and he was tasked with establishing the state-owned China Everbright Group in Hong Kong to acquire foreign investment and technologies. He served as Chairman of Everbright from 1983 to 1989, during which he played a significant economic role as well as a major diplomatic role as an intermediary between China and the West. He invited many foreign dignitaries to visit Everbright, including American leaders Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger and Walter Mondale, Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, and Indonesian President Suharto. From 1983 to 1993, Wang served two terms as Vice Chairperson of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). From 1993 to 2003, he served two more terms as Vice Chairperson of the National People's Congress (NPC). For twenty years in the two high-ranking positions, he performed mainly diplomatic roles and received many visiting foreign leaders. Wang died in Beijing on 29 October 2018, at the age of 99.

It was originally developed in the Kwitang village, which is now part of the Senen subdistrict in Central Jakarta, Indonesia. This style is a hybrid martial arts, developed by combining the local silat with the Chinese- influenced kuntao. The Mustika Kwitang Silat School was founded in 1945 by H. Muhammad Djaelani (Mad Djaelani), who previously studied the martial arts from his own family.  Etymology  The name Kwitang is probably as a modification of Tjung Tang Kiam's name (a kuntao practitioner); or derived from the name Gnuidang (part of the village where the Chinese settled), which is the Hokkien Amoy spelling for Guangdong in China.  History  There are many versions on the formation of this martial arts in the Kwitang Village. In the mid of the 19th century, the village was inhabited by Betawinese, Chinese and Arab peoples. Most versions agreed that the kuntao martial arts was taught by a Chinese tobacco trader, kuntao practitioner, and medicine man named Tjung Tang Kiam.An alternative names mentioned were Kwee Tang Kiam and Kwik Tang Kiam. Tang Kiam, according to researcher G.J.Nawi, was an assistant and a student of Kam Siok, a Tit Khun martial art master from Hokkien (southern China) who visited Batavia in 1840. Tang Kiam's well known kuntao expertise might have provoked the Betawi silat masters in the area to challenge him in a duel. As the stories go, Mad Djaelani's grandfather succeeded in defeating Tang Kiam, who then taught him the kuntao martial art. It was told that Djaelani's grandfather mastered the Pangeran Papak silat and the kebatinan (inner power forming). The combined silat-kuntao style was then taught internally to his family, and called the Kwitang silat. During the Indonesian revolution struggle (1945-1949), Mad Djaelani founded the Mustika Kwitang Silat School, and taught his grandson H. Muhammad Zakaria. Djaelani passed away in 1969, and Zakaria continued as the principal guru of the school. Zakaria had the chance to demonstrate his martial arts in front of the Shotokan master Masatoshi Nakayama and the martial arts author Donn F. Draeger, when they visited Indonesia in the '60's. Draeger then included a review of the Kwitang silat in his famous book, Weapons and Fighting Arts of Indonesia. In 1973, the school joined the Persatuan Pencak Silat Putra Betawi (Association of Betawi Martial Arts Schools). The association became one of the 9 \\"Historic Associations\\" that supported to the Ikatan Pencak Silat Indonesia (Indonesian Pencak Silat Association), and since then began sending silat athletes regularly to the National Sports Week competition. The Kwitang silat style currently has spread in various places in Indonesia and abroad.  Forms  Generally known Kwitang silat characteristics are medium horse stance, attractive and energetic movements, and quick and powerful blows. Blocking of enemy attacks tends to be done by pitting the strength of the hands.  Basic barehanded forms  Below are the names of the basic barehanded forms of Kwitang silat: # Sideways punch # Straight punch towards the abdomen and block the punch towards the abdomen # Straight punch towards the face and block towards the face # Sideways punch and block the kick (Lok Bee) # Catch the opponent's punch and respond with sideways punch # Catch the opponent's punch and respond with elbow and punch # Sideways punch and ward block and elbow # Catch the opponent's punch and break it  Core barehanded forms  Below are the names of the core barehanded forms of Kwitang silat, taught after mastering the basic forms: # Shoot (continuous punches) # Piong # Wave 1 # Wave 2 # Wave 3 # Wave 4 # Wave 5 # Wave 6 # Swimming Dragon  Weapon forms  Below are the names of the weapon forms of Kwitang silat, taught after mastering the basic and core forms: # 2 Knives (2 Pisau) # Machete (Golok) # Staff (Toya) # Spear (Koleam) # Trident (Taichu)  See also  * Betawi people * Beksi * Cingkrik * Kwitang  References  Category:Silat Category:Indonesian martial arts ","title":"Kwitang silat"},{"id":"58926324","text":"Werman is a surname.

The belts comprised two defensive barriers that included forts, lunettes, ramparts, batteries, and other defensive structures. Many of these structures proved to be ineffective in war due to advancement in weapon technology and the evolution of attack strategies at the time. Some of the fortifications of the ceintures de Lyon have been destroyed, though many remain today.  History  After the July Revolution in 1830 and the end of the Bourbon monarchy, the government feared a new war. Austria was seen as the major threat to France at the time, and so protecting the east and south-east borders became a priority. Fort de Loyasse, northern corner  Construction of the first belt  The barracks of Fort de Montessuy in Caluire-et-Cuire In 1830 the mar√©chal de camp, Hubert Rohault de Fleury, commenced a project designed by military engineer Baron Haxo. With a budget of francs (approximately ‚Ç¨ as of 2015) allocated for Lyon between 1831 and 1839, this first project included the restoration of the fortifications between Croix Rousse and Fourvi√®re; the construction of two forts on the plateau of Caluire (Fort de Montessuy and Fort de Caluire, connected by the Enceinte de Caluire), facing the Dombes; closing access to the Presqu'√Æle by the construction of a south-facing building; building two forts ‚Äì Fort de la Duch√®re and Fort de Grange Blanche ‚Äì to protect access routes towards Paris and Auvergne. The hillfort at Fourvi√®re The fortification of the city is divided into three sectors: The north was protected by the wall of Croix- Rousse and the structures between the Rh√¥ne and the Sa√¥ne. The command was situated at fort de Montessuy. The west was covered by the hillfort of Fourvi√®re and the associated forts of Vaise at Sainte-Foy. The command was situated at fort Saint-Ir√©n√©e. The east was defended by the Redoute du Haut- Rh√¥ne and Fort de la Vitriolerie on the left bank of the Rh√¥ne. The command was situated at Fort Lamothe. The work required almost workers, which were locally sourced in an attempt to avoid insurrection such as the ongoing unrest of the Lyon silk workers (Canuts) over increased capitalism. Work began in 1831 to build seven structures, each structure requiring between 400 and 500 workers. The scope of this project included the construction of Fort de Montessuy and Fort de Caluire to the north; Fort des Brotteaux, Fort Montluc and Fort du Colombier to the east; the Redoute de la Part-Dieu to the west; and Fort Saint-Ir√©n√©e, to protect the entire area. In January 1831, an uprising began at a work site in Charpennes, however it was quickly stopped by the army. Other insurrections took place the same year, a series of Canut revolts, which succeeded in rallying soldiers on the side of the Canuts, resulting in the death of captain Viquesnel, aide-de-camp of Fleury, and the temporary withdrawal of the soldiers who eventually retook the city in December 1831. In 1832, three other structures were built to reinforce the defenses to the east: The Redoute de la T√™te d'or, Fort La Motte, and the Redoute des Hirondelles. A treaty was signed between the city of Lyon and the War Department, which stipulated that the city had to cede the land necessary for the construction of military buildings to the War Department, while the forts themselves would still belong to the city if the military decided to abandon them. It is thanks to this treaty that the forts of Croix Rousse, Fourvi√®re, Loyasse, Vaise, and Saint-Jean would later be returned to the city. Construction resumed in 1840. First the Fort de la Vitriolerie in 1840, then Fort de Sainte-Foy-l√®s-Lyon and the Lunette des Charpennes in 1842, Fort de la Duch√®re in 1844, the Redoute du Petit Sainte-Foy-l√®s-Lyon in 1852, and finally the Redoute du haut-Rh√¥ne in 1854. Map of Lyon and its forts in 1844 A law was voted in on 10 July 1851, which defined the methods of destruction of these buildings or construction on their land. By 1854, 19 structures including 10 forts had been built around Lyon, creating a nearly fortified perimeter.  Franco-Prussian War  Map of Lyon and its fortifications in 1872 On 19 July 1870, France declared war on Prussia. On 20 August 1870, the Prussians besieged Metz, and Paris on 19 September 1870. It was feared that Lyon would be next. The army in Lyon was commanded by the g√©n√©ral de division, Ulrich Ochsenbein at the time. During the Battle of Sedan on 2 September 1870, France learned that the Germans did not focus on enemy defenses to force cities to surrender. Rather they destroyed homes and population centers using long-range incendiary artillery shells. The forts that were already constructed in France were therefore ineffective in defending against these attacks. The war ended after the signing of the Treaty of Frankfurt on 10 May 1871, and the Ministry of the Armed Forces requested a report on the construction of military works for the defense of Lyon on 4 August 1871. The ministry concluded that the forts constructed before 1870 (Rohault de Fleury) were obsolete because they were too close to the city, and that new rifled cannons could reach a distance of . A budget of francs (approximately ‚Ç¨ as of 2015) was allocated for the defense of the Alps, half of that was used for the defense of Lyon to protect from invasion by the Swiss. The project was awarded by then president Patrice de MacMahon, to the director of Military engineering and Brigadier general Raymond Adolphe S√©r√© de Rivi√®res in 1874. The proposed defenses included the construction of a fort and batteries on Mont Verdun to protect the right bank of the Sa√¥ne, the forts of V√©nissieux, Bron and Cusset to protect the left banks of the Rh√¥ne, and a fortification between the Rh√¥ne and the Sa√¥ne at la Pape.  Powder magazines  Although most of the fortified structures had gunpowder magazines to supply the artillery, fortified magazines were set up behind the defense lines. Place de Lyon was divided into four sectors, each with its own dedicated gunpowder magazine. The first, (Fort du Mont Verdun) was created in Fort de la Duch√®re, the second (Fort de Vancia) at Sathonay, the third (Fort de Feyzin) in an underground magazine at Saint-Fons, and the fourth (fort du Bruissin) in Fort de Sainte-Foy. These magazines were connected by road or rail. The two underground magazines, Saint-Fons built in 1890 and Sathonay in 1894, each had a capacity of of gunpowder. An annex was built near Saint-Fons in 1895 to store picric acid.  Construction of the second belt  The entrance of fort de Vancia Military leaders saw an urgent need to construct four additional forts: The Fort du Mont Verdun in 1874 to the north, the Fort de Bron and Fort de Feyzin in 1875 to the east, and the Fort de Vancia in 1876. Other projects started in 1878 include the Batterie de la Freta, connected to fort du Mont Verdun; the Batterie de Sathonay and Batterie de Sermenaz, connected to Fort de Vancia; the Fort du Bruissin; the Fort de Corbas; and the Batteries de Parilly and Lessignas. Map of Lyon in 1888 The construction of Fort du Paillet began in 1883, then Fort de Meyzieu and Fort de Genas the following year. Picric acid began to be used on the battlefield at this time. The explosion caused by this chemical was so powerful that the forts proved to be ineffective, and consequently their construction was temporarily put on hold. The damage caused by this new weapon, along with the rifled-barreled weapons deployed in battle in 1860, proved to be a significant problem. An experiment was conducted in 1886 by military engineers to verify the power of picric acid and its impact on their fortification systems. Fort Malmaison, which had recently been constructed near Paris, was the target of 171 test shells of all calibers containing picric acid. The results showed that the impacts of the new shells left craters 6 meters in diameter, and were capable of breaching the powder magazine to create a huge explosion. An expensive and more effective fortification material, reinforced concrete, was available; however, it was only used on the forts of the Maginot Line and certain strategic parts of the Lyon forts, such as the barracks of Cavalier de Vancia. The decree of 21 January 1887 by General Boulanger, then Minister of the Armies of the French Republic, renamed the military buildings to honor local military victors and victories. Therefore, Fort de Vaise became \\"Fort Clerc\\", Fort de Loyasse became \\"Fort Blandan\\" after Jean Pierre Hippolyte Blandan, Fort Saint-Jean was renamed \\"Fort Maupetit\\", Fort Saint-Ir√©n√©e became \\"Fort Dubois-Cranc√©\\" after Edmond Louis Alexis Dubois-Cranc√©, Fort de la Vitriolerie became \\"Fort Chabert\\", fort de Villeurbanne became \\"Fort Montluc\\" after Blaise de Monluc, and the Barracks of Fort Part-Dieu became the \\"Barracks of Margaron\\" after Pierre Margaron. On 22 July 1887, it also specified several modifications to be made to the forts, including moving the artillery from the forts to the batteries, and using concrete in place of traditional masonry. Fort de Saint- Priest was built with this new material in 1887, followed by Fort de Chapoly in 1891.  First belt  The first belt, called the Rohault de Fleury system, consisted of 22 fortifications commissioned by Rohault de Fleury. They were situated in a radius of about around the urban center of Lyon. This belt was constructed between 1830 and 1870.

While the effects are slick and the ghosts match up to international standards, they cannot save this film from turning into a painful two-hour-long watch\\". In contrast, Subhash K. Jha of CNN-News18 gave it three stars out of five and opined: \\"Death is indeed a \\"grave\\" matter in Hindi horror, what with the graveyard being a favourite haunt of horror. Amavas doesn't visit any graveyard but a grave plays an important part in the rites of exorcism. The film presses all the right buttons, ticks all the boxes\\".

This notorious satirical comedy has been described as \\"perhaps the most accomplished [Chinese] film made in the 17 years between 1949 and the Cultural Revolution\\". Due to its controversial subject matter, the movie was received very poorly by the censor critics and not shown to a wider public, and led to L√º Ban's ban from future film making until his death two decades later. Plot Two comedians perform a series of sketches in a theatre for a group of Communist Party officials, including a critic censor. Cast Cast members include: *Han Langen, as comedian 1 *Yin Xiucen, as comedian 2 *Fang Hua as Comrade Yi Bangzi, the censor/critic *Su Manyi (ËãèÊõºÊÑè) *Chen Zhong *Ning Jiapin *Wen Hua  Production  The movie was directed by L√º Ban of the Changchun Film Studio during the period of lessened censorship in 1956‚Äì57 (known as the Hundred Flowers Campaign). Reception During the Anti-Rightist Movement, a backlash against the liberal Hundred Flowers Campaigns, the movie was subject to harsh criticism. The movie has been widely criticized for Chinese censors for excessive slapstick and \\"taking the satirical license too far\\". The movie subject matter was too controversial for its time, as it touched upon a sensitive topic of film censorship and its portrayal of the \\"humorless party official\\", a film censor nicknamed \\"The Bludgeon\\", and the main object of ridicule in the film, has been described as unflattering. The censor is alleged to be blind, uninterested in either watching or discussing the movie, yet drunk on his power related to deciding whether the movie will be allowed to be screened or not. Its criticism of the censor official was interpreted as too close to the criticism of the Communist Party itself, as after all it was the Party that argued for the necessity of censorship. It headed the list of problematic movies, the so-called \\"poisonous weeds\\" list, and was banned before its release. Chen Huangmei, an important Party official described as \\"film czar\\", lambasted the movie in an editorial in People's Daily, as \\"thoroughly anti-Party, antisocialist, and tasteless\\". The movie and L√º Ban became subject to a number of highly critical articles in Chinese press. The Unfinished Comedy ended L√º Ban's career as shortly afterward, L√º Ban himself was banned from directing for life and sentenced to internal exile; he had to abandon work on film-making, leaving behind several unfinished projects, and died in 1976 without being allowed to work on another film. The disastrous reception of the movie by the film censors was one of the reasons for other Chinese film makers putting more effort into self-censorship and abandoning the genre of satirical comedy (the next one would not appear in Chinese theaters until mid-80s); for years to come, the dominant model of comedy in China became one that avoided conflict, and presented safe stories involving model socialist citizens learning how to better live in the harmonious socialist society. The reception of the movie abroad has been significantly better. Paul Clark in his book on Chinese Cinema described it as \\"perhaps the most accomplished [Chinese] film made in the 17 years between 1949 and the Cultural Revolution\\".

Nomadic, warlike and fiercely independent, they roamed between Buraimi and Qatar, the Persian Gulf coast to Liwa and also settled in the Northern emirates. They subsisted through date farming, pearling and moving goods with their camel trains, as well as camel breeding.  Independent Bedouin  One of the most important tribes in the emirate of Abu Dhabi (together with the Bani Yas, with whom they cooperated and coexisted closely), the tribe was traditionally predominant in the desert areas between Buraimi and Qatar and the Persian Gulf coast to Liwa, but Manasir families had settled Abu Dhabi, Buraimi, Al Khan and Jumeirah by the turn of the 20th century. Apart from the settled population in the towns, the Manasir were entirely nomadic Bedouin, while the tribe they shared this region with, the Bani Yas, was largely settled. There were also a number of nomadic Marar families in the Liwa region. Manasir houses in the Liwa Crescent were mostly seasonal areesh, or palm frond constructions, maintained as dwellings during the summer date season. Some 1,400 Manasir roamed this tribal area or dar at the turn of the century, but surveys in the 1950s point to a total population of some 4,000: 2,800 of these lived in the emirate of Abu Dhabi while the balance lived both settled and nomadic lives in the other Trucial States. The Manasir were fiercely independent and, unlike their settled counterparts the Bani Yas, did not necessarily consider themselves dependents of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. They did co-operate closely with the Bani Yas, however, and of 42 settlements in the Liwa area, Manasir were found in 36. They were an inland people with limited maritime resources and had few boats of their own. They worked the pearl banks with the Bani Yas, or worked as divers or haulers for various nakhudas. During the date season, Manasir who did not own their own plantations would work on settled plantations for payment in kind. The Manasir were exempted from paying the customary date tax to the Ruler of Abu Dhabi.  Decline in revenues  Subsections of the tribe include the Al Bu Mundir (Kaabara, Mani, Marashid, Matawaah, Midahima); Al Bu Rahamah (Al Bu Khail, Tarsif, Tararifah and Wabran) and the Al Bu Shaar (Ghawainam, Rashaiyid and Al Bu Thuwaibit). All of these wintered to the North West (by the border with Qatar) and summered in Liwa, although the Al Bu Khail section of the Al Bu Rahamah wintered in Semeih and Abu Dhabi and summered in Buraimi. Formerly subject to the Wahhabi government, they had asserted their independence by the turn of the 20th century and were closer to Abu Dhabi, but remained essentially independent, with their own sheikhs. The Manasir bred camels and also carried trade goods from the oases to Abu Dhabi. They made their own charcoal and would carry this, dates, limes, wheat and other produce from the oases to the towns. The annual seasonal migration of families from Abu Dhabi took place to the oases of the interior (both Al Ain, then known as Buraimi and Liwa) for the hot summer months and the date season ‚Äì and the Manasir would be hired to provide the camel trains. As the revenues of the pearl trade declined in the late 1920s, the Manasir's trade in breeding and hiring camels for the carrying trade suffered and an increase in Manasir raids on the communities of the Northern emirates resulted. This led to the respective rulers of Abu Dhabi being pressed for reparations by other Trucial Sheikhs as their own dependents took their claims to the majlis to be settled.  Alternative sources of revenue  An alternative source of revenue for the Manasir was working for the oil companies: ARAMCO or Qatar Petroleum. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd had 40 Manasir on its payroll, but they only took work for as long as it took to pay off their immediate economic need, a date garden or perhaps a new wife. Latterly, it would be a Land Rover. Their animals would be left with a relative while they took up this temporary work. As this pattern of working for oil companies turned into longer term employment, and the Buraimi Dispute began to show how tribal affiliations could turn into territorial claims, the government of Abu Dhabi started to regulate this movement of labour and Manasir who stayed away longer than a year were liable to find their date plantations confiscated. Another source of revenue as the march of civilisation forced changes to their way of life was to work as a retainer for the Ruler of Abu Dhabi. The Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi in their turn recognised that the Manasir was a potent and influential force and ensured that employment opportunities were open and subsidies paid to the Sheikhs of the Manasir. In the 1950s, the Ruler of Abu Dhabi had 85 regularly paid Manasir retainers.  Conflicts  The Manasir frequently formed an important part of Abu Dhabi's fighting force, and always fought alongside the Bani Yas. When Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnun Al Nahyan repelled the Wahhabis from the Buraimi Oasis in 1848, it was the Manasir, together with the Mazari, who waited South of Abu Dhabi to fall on the relieving force send from Nejd under Saad bin Mutlaq. They were fighting again in Buraimi in 1923, when the Manasir played a key role in fighting against the Duru, Bani Qitab and Awamir in Buraimi ‚Äì a conflict that was to lead to a long period of inter-tribal skirmishing and raiding throughout the interior. However, they were also a force to be reckoned with and willing to play king-maker: in 1928 Sheikh Saqr bin Zayed Al Nahyan was shot and killed by a group of Al Balushi and Manasir, paving the way for the rule of Sheikh Shakbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and again in 1927, when Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi of Sharjah expelled Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmad Al Qasimi with the help of the Manasir.

Berlin 1943, p 26. is a cryptographic term used particularly in connection with the Wehrmacht, which used wahlworts on their Enigma rotor machine in the encryption of their communication in World War II. The term describes a randomly selected word which was inserted at the beginning or end of the radiogram plaintext. The wahlwort was intended to hinder the enemy‚Äôs cryptanalysis and prevent the decryption of the ciphertext.  Application  According to the secret regulations in force at that time, outlined in Der Schl√ºssel M - Verfahren M Allgemein (The Cipher M ‚àí M General Procedure), this procedure was used primarily to give radio messages different lengths (‚ÄúCipher M‚Äù refers to the Enigma M4, naval variant of the series of Enigma machines). OKM: Der Schl√ºssel M ‚Äì Verfahren M Allgemein. Berlin 1940, p 9. Indeed, plaintexts with the same content often had to be transmitted to different receiving operators in their encrypted form. To do so they were encrypted with different keys corresponding to the different encryption networks. This resulted in ciphertexts that were different, yet had the same length. If the enemy noticed different ciphertexts of a similar length at approximately the same time, possibly from the same transmitting operator, the receiving operator would assume that a known- ciphertext-attack was taking place. The British Codebreakers from the English Bletchley Park (B. P.)Gordon Welchman: The Hut Six Story ‚Äì Breaking the Enigma Codes. Allen Lane, London 1982; Cleobury Mortimer M&M;, Baldwin Shropshire 2000, p 11\\\\. were familiar with such cases and glad to receive them, naming this a kiss. Such a kiss was considered as an ideal opportunity to decipher radio messages, even better than a ‚ÄúCrib,‚Äù a deciphered text section. By introducing wahlworts of different lengths at the beginning or the end of the sentence, sometimes both the beginning and the end, the length of the messages differ, which prevented or at least hindered the enemy from accessing it. The length of a wahlwort was usually between four and fourteen letters. The German code book gave as examples; ‚ÄúWassereimer (bucket), Fernsprecher (telephone), Eichbaum (oak tree), Dachfirst (roof ridge), Kleiderschrank (wardrobe).‚Äù Wahlworts with only three letters occasionally appeared in the code, such as ABC or XXX, but also very long compounds, such as Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapit√§n (Danube steamboating association captain) or Hottentottenpotentatentantenattent√§ter (Hottentot potentate aunt assassin ). The rationale for choosing more or less meaningful German words as wahlworts (specifically compound nouns) as opposed to random text such as CIHJT UUHML, was so that the authorized recipient could verify that their deciphering of the radio message was error-free. However, according to regulations, wahlworts were required to be entirely unrelated to the content of the actual radio message, and to not ‚Äúinfringe on discipline and order.‚Äù Wahlworts were also used in conjunction with other ciphering machines such as the Geheimschreiber (secret teleprinter) Siemens & Halske T52.Bengt Beckman: Arne Beurling und Hitlers Geheimschreiber. Springer-Verlag 2006, ‚ÄúIntroduced in 1940 on a wholesale scale, wahlworts might have knocked out the infant Crib Room before it had got properly on its feet.‚Äù John Jackson: Solving Enigma‚Äôs Secrets ‚Äì The Official History of Bletchley Park‚Äôs Hut 6\\\\. BookTower Publishing 2014, pp 215‚Äì216. . Results The introduction of wahlworts, which was first observed by the British in 1942 in North Africa, impeded the codebreaker's work. However, at that time the British were so well acquainted with the German methods that there was no stopping their continued success in code-breaking, despite the wahlworts. It was a nuisance for them to have to try out the various possibilities pertaining to the word order of the text when they did not know the length of the wahlworts, but this could not stop them from deciphering the text. Post-war British review of the German wahlwort method revealed the practice to be \\"too little and too late\\". As with other German measures attempting to strengthen the cryptographic security of Enigma, for example the introduction of the cryptographically strong methods of the Enigma Uhr (clock), or the pluggable UKW D (nick-named Uncle Dick by the British), wahlworts failed because they were not introduced comprehensively and were adopted too late in the war.

The Frankish army under King Pepin the Short invested the fort with lines of circumvallation, contravallation and siege engines. The walls were breached and the fort taken. Count Chunibert of Bourges swore his loyalty to Pepin along with his Gascon levies and their families. Pepin appointed several counts of his own to garrison the place and the Frankish army went on to besiege Thouars. Prelude After his conquest and devastation of Aquitanian Auvergne in 761, King Pepin the Short of Francia gathered his army and besieged Bourges in 762. The garrison, commanded by Count Chunibert of Bourges, included both Duke Waiofar of Aquitaine's men and Gascon levies with their families. Siege Pepin's army invested the fort on all sides with field fortifications and pillaged the surrounding countryside. Pepin then had a second line of fortifications built, either against the fort or the countryside, preventing anyone from getting in or out of the town and protecting the besiegers and their equipment. The town was subsequently surrounded with siege engines and a rampart was built to protect the machines. The town walls were breached and after many had been wounded and more killed, the town fell. Aftermath Pepin restored the town to his rule. He allowed Waiofar's men to live and told them to go home. Count Chunibert and the Gascon levies were made to swear their fealty to the king and remain in his presence. The wives and children of the Gascon levies were ordered to march on foot to Francia. Pepin used his craftsmen and supplies to repair the walls and left counts of his own to hold the place, implying a garrison of at least several hundred soldiers.

Biography Francesco Restelli was born (and would eventually die) in Milan. He studied Law at the University of Pavia, though he preferred to devote himself to studying Social sciences. In 1840 he published a substantive essay in that discipline which had been written, in part, by Paolo Manio, a fellow student who had died aged just 24, leaving Restelli to finish the work. Four years later he was a participant at the Sixth Congress of Italian Scientists, which on that occasion was held in Milan. He attracted the interest of fellow delegates when he presented a detailed paper on commercial law, while highlighting contribution of industrial and commercial associations to public prosperity. For the next few years he worked as a lawyer. On 18 March 1848 he hastened to join those manning the barricades. On 20 March Restelli joined Milan's Committee of Public Security, presided over by Dr.Angelo Fava. A couple of days later Field Marshall Radetsky withdrew the Austrian army from Milan, which left the city under the control of a hastily assembled provisional government. On 3 April 1848 Restelli was sent by the provisional government to Venice, which was under the control of its own provisional government, following Radetsky's strategic (and as matters turned out temporary) militarily withdrawal to the \\"Quadrilatero\\" forts. Restelli's mission was to foster agreement between Lombardy and Venice, while at the same time promoting the idea of a three way anti-Austrian union that would also include Sardinia-Piedmont. His mission concluded on 20 July 1848 and he returned to Milan where things were moving on. The fusion of \\"the city and province of Venice, the Sardinian states with Lombardy\\" had been decreed on 4 July 1848. The move had been overwhelmingly endorsed by a popular referendum in Lombardy, but the territories of Venice - aside from the city itself - had been militarily retaken at the end of June by the Austrians. The Austrians then defeated the army of Sardinia-Piedmont at Custoza on 24/25 July 1848. The defeat was far from overwhelming, but the Sardinian king was persuaded to sign an agreement with the Austrians on 4/5 August 1848 and withdrew his armies to the western bank of the Ticino. Regardless of the referendum result, a three way fusion with Piedmont and Venice was not about to happen, and in the Lombard capital the mood was one of political uncertainty. On 28 July 1848 Restelli joined Manfredo Fanti and Pietro Maestri in the Committee of Public Defence which effectively replaced the provisional government. Once the Austrians and the Piedmontese had agreed what amounted to an armistice on 4/5 August 1848 it no longer made sense for the Milanese Committee of Public Defence to hold out against the Austrian troops, and on 6 August 1848, with Austrian forces already inside the city walls and advancing on the city centre, Francesco Restelli fled his native city, successfully making the highly journey dangerous north to Lugano in the southern part of Ticino (Switzerland) where he arrived the next day. Pietro Maestri had also managed to escape to Lugano where the two of them teamed up to write \\"Gli ultimi tristissimi fatti di Milano narrati/stampati dal Comitato di Pubblica Difesa\\" (loosely, \\"The latest very sad facts about Milan, told/published by the Committee of Public Defence\\"). They managed to get it printed in Venice where, still in 1848, several reprints were produced. Restelli's exile lasted for more than half a decade. He moved from Lugano to Genoa (which at this stage, following the failure of a revolt in April 1849, was still part of Sardinia- Piedmont). He then relocated to Florence, which was still under Austrian control. In 1854, thanks to an amnesty agreed by the authorities, he was able to return to Milan. After Lombardy was liberated from Austrian control it became part of Sardinia-Piedmont, and in March 1860 Restelli was elected a member of parliament. He was re-elected to membership of the lower house (\\"Chamber of deputies\\") in successive elections over the next twenty-five years. It is probably misleading to try and subdivide Sardinian/Italian members of parliament in terms of political parties, but Francesco Restelli was a member of the large group of parliamentarians generally identified, in retrospect, as the Historical Right (\\"Destra storica\\"). On 11 February 1863 his fellow parliamentarians elected him one of the seven vice-presidents of the \\"chamber of deputies\\": he received 120 of the 218 votes cast. In December 1866 only four parliamentary vice-presidents were elected: Restelli was one of them. In the end Francesco Restelli was elected a vice-president of the \\"chamber of deputies\\" five times during the 1860s and 1870s. On 7 June 1886 he was appointed a member of the senate. (Appointment to the senate was - at least nominally - in the gift of the king: senators remained in place till they died.)

It is an evergreen, terrestrial herb with large, crowded pseudobulbs, large pleated leaves and flowers that are white on the outside and sulfur yellow inside. Apart from flower colour, the species is identical to P. tankervilleae var. bernaysii.  Description  Phaius tankervilleae var. bernaysii is an evergreen, terrestrial herb with fleshy, crowded pseudobulbs long and wide. There are between four and eight pleated, lance-shaped, dark green leaves long and wide, with the narrower end towards the base. Between four and sixteen fleshy flowers long and long are borne on a thick flowering stem long. The flowers are the largest of all Australian orchids and are white on the outside, sulfur yellow on the inside. The sepals are long, wide, the dorsal sepal angled upwards and the lateral sepals spread widely apart from each other. The petals are a similar size to the sepals. The labellum is long, wide, has three lobes and ranges in colour from yellow to bright purple. The middle lobe has wavy or crinkly edges and the side lobe sometimes form a tube shape around the column or spread widely apart from each other. Flowering occurs between September and November in Australia. Taxonomy and naming The yellow swamp orchid was first formally described in 1873 by Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach and given the name Phaius bernaysii, giving credit to \\"Dr Rowland\\" for the discovery. The description was published in The Gardeners' Chronicle. Reichenbach apparently thought that the name was given by Dr Rowland to honour Lewis Adolphus Bernays. A later edition of The Gardeners' Chronicle included a letter from Lewis Bernays explaining that he himself had collected the specimens and sent them to Ferdinand von Mueller and to his friend \\"Dr Rowland of Malvern\\" for him to take to \\"the eminent firm of Messrs. Veitch & Son\\", (possibly Veitch Nurseries in London). \\"Dr Rowland of Malvern\\" may have been Hugh Mortimer Rowland who had been the first doctor in the village of Carcoar from 1857 to 1867 before returning to England where he died in 1882. The unpublished manuscript had therefore been written by von Mueller, a fact of which Reichenbach was apparently unaware. The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families gives the author of the manuscript as Ferdinand von Mueller, although Mueller was not mentioned in Reichenbach's article. In 2017, Judi Stone and Phillip James Cribb published a monograph entitled Lady Tankerville's Legacy - A Historical and Monographic Review of Phaius and Gastrorchis and reduced Phaius bernaysii to a variety of Phaius tankervilleae. Distribution and habitat Phaius tankervilleae var. bernaysii is found in near-coastal swampy forest. It occurs on Stradbroke Island but has been seen in the past on Peel Island, Bribie Island and at Noosa Heads. Conservation The yellow swamp orchid, as Phaius bernaysii, is listed as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. The main threats to the species are illegal collection of the plants and flowers, inappropriate fire regimes and changes in swamp hydrology due to human activities.

Her family originally came from the small Turkish town Kutahya. They fled Turkey on foot to Greece in 1917. From there, they took ship for France. Marie grew up in Lyon, France. As a six-year-old girl she began drawing and at ten she was doing portraits. She studied at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux- Arts in Lyon but had to drop out for financial reasons. In 1953 she met her distant cousin Setrak on his way to study ceramic technology with Ray Finch and Bernard Leach in England. They married in 1954 in Betlehem. Her contribution to Middle Eastern art was to introduce more Armenian elements -by adding trees, animals and birds in a primitive style-to renovate art, and elevate the craft to fine art and therewith brought her own cachet. She added movement to what had traditionally been static compositions and reminded us of the glorious beauty of nature. Suddenly, gazelles were prancing, peacocks were preening, garlands were flowing. The concept known as the Gardens and Views of Paradise of Marie Balian developed. She referred to 13th century after Christ when Persian artists were favoring garden scenes for their painted ceramic tiles. Symmetry gave way to dynamic asymmetry. At a later age she herself becomes aware she is a link in an ancient chain, and that she has played a crucial role in rescuing one branch of a centuries-old tradition from oblivion. \\"It's very easy for me. It's as if I had already done this in an earlier age, like the fourth, fifth or sixth century.\\" She became the master painter of the Balian atelier in East-Jerusalem, the Palestinian Pottery and a renowned artist. In the introduction of the award-winning documentary \\"The Glimps of Paradise\\" about her life and art and worldwide recognition Marie is described as one of the icons of the Jerusalem art world. The book \\"Birds of Paradise\\" further documents her fine art. Modern media like Google Images and Pinterest show a variety of her work.  Balian Family  Armenian Pottery at Marie Balian's Workshop, copy of \\"Tree of Life\\" mosaic from Hisham's Palace In the 1600s, Armenian artisans in a small Turkish town named Kutahya developed a distinctive \\"Islamic\\" style in decorative ceramics, while also developing a series of unique and instantly recognizable local styles including playful figures, ceramic eggs, coffee cups, rosewater jars and various types of votive ware. In late 1918, the British authorities invited David Ohannessian (commons), a renowned ceramicist who had established a workshop in Kutahya in 1907 and had developed an international clientele there, but had been deported to Aleppo in 1916, to travel to Jerusalem to consult on the planned British renovation of the tiling of the Dome of the Rock. After some experiments with the existing 19th century kiln and local materials, Ohannessian returned to Kutahya to obtain the needed clays and other minerals and recruit the remaining Armenian ceramicists to join him in Jerusalem. Ohannessian brought 8-10 Kutahya artisans to Jerusalem in 1919, including the expert wheel potter Nishan Balian, and the accomplished painter Mgrditch Karakashian. Balian and Karakashian worked for Ohannessian until 1922, when they struck out on their own, opening a second Armenian ceramics atelier in Jerusalem, located on Nablus Road. In 1966 the Balian and Karakashian families split their businesses and established separate workshops. The Balian atelier was known as the Palestinian Pottery and Marie was the master painter. Neshan, Marie's son feels compelled to continue the family tradition. He studied ceramic engineering in the United States  Fame and recognition  Marie Balian came to world attention in 1992 when the Smithsonian Institution, the national museum of the United States, paid tribute to her work with a six-month show. The exhibition \\"Views of Paradise\\" included more than 20 wall-size panels that together presented the artist's conception of the ultimate garden. The exhibition was so well-received that the gallery extended its stay Further exhibitions followed in Boston MA (ALMA Museum), Israel (Eretz Israel Museum) and Alicante, Spain. Balian's work is shown on a stamp and many publications followed Balian's work is widely spread on the internet, and in museums such as the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, England Works from the \\"Views of Paradise\\" exhibition were installed in the Persian Garden in Wassenaar, The Netherlands.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.  History  In 1885, Daniel M. Christian opened a large dry-goods business in Owosso, the first real store in the town. By the turn of the century, Christian's store had evolved into the first real department store in town. In about 1895, Christian constructed this house for his family. He lived here until moving into the Goodhue-Christian House (located in the Oliver Street Historic District). After Christian moved, the house was purchased by J. Edwin Ellis, president of the Independent Stove Company. Ellis had relocated Independent Stove from Detroit in 1908, and continued to live in Detroit, coming to Owosso only for business. However, around 1910, Ellis permanently moved to Owosso. He became actively involved in the city's social life, and served multiple terms as the City's Mayor between 1941 and 1947.  Description  The Christian-Ellis House is a transitional design, containing both Queen Anne and Georgian Revival elements. It is a wood-frame house clad in clapboard, with fish-scale shingling in the gable ends. Queen Anne elements of the design include an asymmetrical floorplan, windows of different styles, a broad wrap-around porch, and an irregular roofline with two gable ends located above the front facade. Georgian Revival features include Doric columns on the porch, paired rounded arch windows on the second story level, and small brackets at the corniceline.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is the oldest residence still extant in the City of Owosso. History Elias Comstock was born in New London, Connecticut in 1799. In 1824, he moved with his parents to Pontiac, Michigan. In 1827, Comstock married Lucy Lamson. Elias worked as a school teacher at the Detroit Academy in Detroit, then moved onto teach at a rural school in Pontiac before briefly becoming a merchant in Stony Creek, Michigan. The Comstocks moved to the newly established community of Owosso in 1835. There, in 1836 he constructed a home, becoming the City's first real settler. Comstock opened a successful mercantile business, ind in 1837 Governor Lewis Cass appointed him the County's Justice of the Peace. He served as the Township's Supervisor between 1838 and 1840, and later served as Judge of Probate, County Judge, and Associate Judge of the Circuit Court. The Comstocks continued to live in their cabin, but over the years, they added a series of frame additions to the house, as well as a long front porch. Eventually the cabin became the living room of the home, and was entirely covered by a frame exterior. Elias Comstock died in 1886, and Lucy Comstock died in 1890. The Comstock house passed on to the Leitch family, then the Corey family. In 1920, the Standard Oil Company purchased the Comstock property and began demolition of the house. They discovered the original log cabin, mostly intact, hidden within the frame house. The Shiawassee County chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution led efforts to preserve the cabin, and moved it to the rear of the lot and preserved as a museum. The cabin was later moved to Bentley Park, and in 1969 was moved again to its current site. The cabin remains a museum and is open for select events Description The Comstock cabin is a one-room log cabin, measuring twenty by thirty feet. It has hand- finished door and window frames and a puncheon floor. The structure has been carefully restored by the city.

She achieved this feat on August 10, 2018, as part of a month-long expedition organised by Ascend Athletics, a nonprofit organisation in Kabul that trains young Afghan women to climb mountains. Noshaq is the second highest mountain in the Hindu Kush range, which runs along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.  Personal life  Yousoufi grew up in Kabul and was sent to Pakistan to marry an older man at the age of about 14. She described the experience as being like \\"a slave for cooking and cleaning\\". After approximately two years she divorced him and went back to her parents in Kabul. Her cousin encouraged Yousoufi to join the program in 2016, and since then she worked as a program assistant while training for climbs. After climbing Noshaq, Yousoufi chose to limit the media exposure to radio and Facebook only (no TV coverage) because of security concerns, but publicized her full name out of pride for her achievement and to inspire other Afghan women.  The expedition  It was a $30,000 expedition, which was fully funded by Ascend Athletics and half of the amount was from a single donor. The team had to face a number of complications, including the fighting between Taliban forces and the Afghan army. Yousoufi had been training with Ascend Athletics to attempt to climb Mt Noshaq since 2016. Mount Noshaq was closed to climbers for about 30 years, due to the fact of several years of unrest during the Taliban rule in the country. It was again opened up in the year 2009. The Taliban shot down two Afghan National Army helicopters in the Zebak on the day before the group was supposed to fly from Kabul to the nearest airfield to hike to the base camp. So, the group was flown to a safer village to continue with the expedition. Mount Noshaq, world's one of the most challenging summits, involves hazards and challenges like dangerous crevasses, fractured ice faces, loose rocks, sub-zero temperature and socio-political issues involving the Taliban; the expedition to the peak involves trekking through the war-torn regions, riddled with land-mines dating back to the Civil War era and where outsiders face the danger of being kidnapped or assaulted. The climb started at 9a.m. and while climbing, Yousoufi faced altitude sickness in Camp Two and had to be brought down to Camp One. Next morning she went back to Camp Two after resting in Camp One. The other two girls could not continue the trek with Yousoufi, due to altitude sickness and she had to continue the climb alone. She reached the summit at 7:10 p.m.  See also  * Bachendri Pal * Junko Tabei * Wanda Rutkiewicz * Arlene Blum * List of Afghan records in athletics  References   External links  * https://www.ascendathletics.org/ * https://twitter.com/sorayanelson/status/1031469249074741249 * https://twitter.com/afghan_ascend * https://www.facebook.com/keihanfoundation/posts/1900067086729466 * https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/957b3b_9fce1f8e07a446f18fb7f40557e52fda.pdf Category:Female climbers Category:Afghan female athletes Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Hanifa Yousoufi"},{"id":"58927183","text":"Sonia Wild Biƒáaniƒá OBE (n√©e Wild, 3 January 1920 ‚Äì 5 December 2017) was an English academic, author and translator whose numerous publications cover topics in the literature, history and culture of both Great Britain and Croatia.

It was created by Israeli entrepreneur Saar Wilf, who previously founded Fraud Sciences, a payment security company acquired by PayPal. Initiative Q is backed by Cato Institute economist Lawrence H. White. Unlike Bitcoin the scheme would not take measures to evade state regulation. Initiative Q‚Äôs goal is to replace payment cards and paper money that use old infrastructure with a new payment system leveraging current-day technologies. It is ‚Äúcreating a new currency (the Q) and distributing it to anyone who helps speed up adoption.\\" The Q is not a cryptocurrency and is not decentralized, but will instead be overseen by an independent monetary committee, much like a central bank. Marketing and Rollout Registering for Initiative Q is marketed through multi-level marketing. The currency reserved for registrants will not be released until a critical mass of adopters identify themselves. In November 2018, Vox.com reported that more than two million people had signed up in 180 countries. Later the same month, O Globo reported more than five million registrations, and The Times of India reported that countries with large numbers of registrations included India, Brazil, United States and United Kingdom. Criticism In October 2018, Frank Chung of news.com.au wrote that the marketing style could be \\"perceived as a scam or pyramid scheme\\" and Daniel Husz√°k of portfolio.hu compared it to multi-level marketing without the fee. Owen Gough of Digital Spy wrote \\"Is Initiative Q real or fake? Short answer ‚Äì we have absolutely no idea.\\" In contrast, Brendan Markey- Tower, economist at the University of Queensland, said on Stuff.co.nz in November 2018 that it was \\"not a scam\\" and that the scheme wouldn't \\"make you fabulously wealthy. It is, nonetheless, an interesting idea.\\" Husz√°k enumerated potential problems with the scheme such as no clear crypto-currency security measures, unclear transaction/exchange costs, and potential for market manipulation by the largest holders of currency.

Whitehead was one of a small number of women from the western world to enter the frontlines as a combatant during World War I after she enlisted as a man in the Royal Serbian Army at the age of 22. During her time on the Balkan Front, she would go on to work as a military engineer, a guard for the Scottish Women's Hospitals, and become a prisoner of war under the Bulgarian Army following the invasion of Belgrade on October 8, 1915.  Early life  Whitehead was born to , a cotton manufacturer from Montmorency, Quebec, and Winifred Thomas Stevenson. She grew up with her two younger brothers, William and Pillans in the city of Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, Canada.\\"Canada Census, 1901,\\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KH5N-TXJ : 18 March 2018), Joy Whitehead in household of Winifred Whitehead, Montr√©al (city/cit√©), Quebec, Canada; citing p. 20, Library and Archives of Canada, Ottawa. Though little is known of Whitehead's early years, her pursuits in adult life centred largely around what would have been deemed traditionally male activities. It has been widely reported that in her young adulthood Whitehead took a keen interest in shooting, driving, and the great outdoors. Prior to the start of the First World War, Whitehead spent a significant amount of time living alone in the Canadian wilderness. According to an article from January 8, 1916 in the Manitoba Free Press, Winnipeg, Whitehead lived an \\"outdoor life\\" for \\"a couple of years [‚Ä¶] in the Laurentian mountains at Val Morina\\".\\"Canadian Girl is a Prisoner in Bulgaria\\", Manitoba Free Press, Winnipeg, Saturday, January 8, 1916, p. 21. The Toronto Daily Star also reported that \\"Miss Whitehead\\" was \\"extremely fond of outdoor life, wore semi-male garb on her tramps through the woods, and could handle a canoe or shoot better than most men\\".\\"Canadian Nurse Bulgar Prisoner\\", The Toronto Daily Star, Friday, January 7, 1916, p. 2.  War Work   Early work and volunteering  When Canada entered the Great War on August 4, 1914 Whitehead was only 19 years old but already resolute in her pursuit of getting to the Front, where she hoped \\"to get fixed as a motor transport or ambulance driver\\".\\"Lady Volunteers From Canada\\", Yorkshire Evening Post, June 3, 1915. As for many women whose true desire lay in getting to the thick of the action on the frontlines, however, Whitehead initially started her war-work away from the firing lines. Travelling to London, England, Whitehead volunteered, alongside \\"a batch of young ladies from Canada\\", to work \\"long hours over the card index and the typewriter in order to\\", as the Yorkshire Evening Post reported on June 3, 1915, \\"keep the people of\\" her \\"own country informed of the condition of the wounded among the Canadian contingent\\".\\"Lady Volunteers From Canada\\", Yorkshire Evening Post, June 3, 1915. This newspaper described \\"Miss Whitehead\\" as \\"a lady volunteer of a very different kind\\" because she could \\"do almost anything in the out-of- door life\\", and was \\"desirous of putting her handiness at the disposal of the military authorities\\".\\"Lady Volunteers From Canada\\", Yorkshire Evening Post, June 3, 1915. During the Great War, however, the Western Front was completely forbidden to women. Conflict zones were deemed far too dangerous a place for the \\"weaker sex\\" to be, with some even considering it an abomination that the female life-giver should enter the battlefield, where she stood to witness brutal and unrelenting loss of life. The few females that did get to this front were, then, either branded \\"camp followers\\" (i.e. prostitutes) or, as in the case of sapper Dorothy Lawrence (the only English woman to cross-dress as a soldier and to gain access to the Western Front in this capacity), sent back to England in a state of disgrace. Whitehead was, however, determined in her goal. Like the women doctors of the Scottish Women's Hospitals, she decided to offer her services to Britain and the Commonwealth's Allies; a decision that would ultimately lead her to Serbia. It was following this Balkan country‚Äôs acceptance of her help that Whitehead became a volunteer engineer with the Serbian Relief Fund in July 1915.  With the Serbian Army  Whitehead enlisted as a man in the Royal Serbian Army at the age of 22. Once in Serbia, Whitehead found herself able to freely live life like a man. This liberty was to be cut short, however, when on October 8, 1915, Serbia fell to Central Power forces. By November 3, 1915, Whitehead was working under occupation in the central Serbian city of Kru≈°evac. According to Dr Catherine Corbett of the Scottish Women's Hospitals Second Serbian unit, this female engineer had been sent to Kru≈°evac with the Serbian army within which she had \\"enlisted as a man\\". According to contemporary newspaper sources, Whitehead was \\"acting as a lieutenant in the Veterinary Corps of the Serbian Army, having given up hospital work\\" so \\"she might get closer to the firing line\\" when Serbia's occupation began.\\"Canadian Nurse Bulgar Prisoner\\", The Toronto Daily Star, Friday January 7, 1916, p. 2. Under occupation, Whitehead's deftness with guns and outdoor skills were to prove more vital than ever before and came in particularly useful for the Scottish Women's Hospitals. Finding themselves frequently targeted by thieves in the form of desperate locals, prisoners of war and enemies alike, the Scottish Women's Hospitals recruited Whitehead as a \\"guard\\" in the hopes that she would help to deter the near-daily pillaging of resources and supplies. Her handiness did not go unnoticed by the enemy and by November 24, 1915, Whitehead found herself under the employment of \\"a German doctor\\", for whom she tended to \\"some large and complicated disinfectors\\".C. L. Corbett, Diary in Serbia (Manchester: Taylor, Garrett, Evan & Co. Ltd., 1916), p. 10.  Prisoner of war  It is unclear what exactly happened to Whitehead between November 1915 and the end of 1916, but by January 7, 1916, both the Toronto Daily Star and The Globe reported that \\"Miss Joy Whitehead, a Quebec Athletic Girl\\" had been \\"locked up\\" by the Bulgarians.\\"Canadian Nurse Bulgar Prisoner\\", The Toronto Daily Star, Friday, January 7, 1916, p. 2. At the time of being made a prisoner of war, The Globe cites Whitehead \\"was captured by the Bulgarians while serving with a British veterinary corps in Serbia\\" ‚Äì a division she had joined \\"owing to her knowledge of horses\\".\\"Three Ricers Girl Taken By Bulgarians\\", The Globe, Friday, January 8, 1916, p. 5.  Personal life and death  At some point during her time as a prisoner of war (c. 1916), Whitehead met and married a lieutenant of the Royal Serbian Army named Vukota Vojinoviƒá (a.k.a Vojinovitch/Voyinovitch) from the city of U≈æice.http://www.politika.rs/scc/clanak/415390/Kultura/Gospodica-V-muskarac-u- srpskoj-armiji The pair returned to Canada where Whitehead gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Mila, in October 1917. The couple went on to have a second daughter in 1922 named Winifred Dana, followed by a son named Miladin (later Dean) in 1923. https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:K8MF-1HQ : 12 March 2018 By this time the young family had travelled together to Naples, Italy, as well as to Patras, Greece. By the 1930s, Whitehead's marriage to Vukota had deteriorated and the pair were divorced. During this time period, she gave birth to a second son, David John Vaughan. By 1937 Whitehead had re-married a man named George Andrew Vaughan. The pair lived together in British Columbia, Canada and remained married until George's death on October 9, 1944. It is not known if the couple had children together. Whitehead died a widow in Princeton, British Columbia on June 5, 1964, aged 69, after developing a carcinoma of the stomach.http://search- collections.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/genealogy-images/004479258/004479258_01072.jpg  References  Category:1895 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Female wartime cross-dressers Category:Canadian women in World War I Category:Women soldiers Category:Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service ","title":"Leslie Joy Whitehead"},{"id":"58927390","text":"Tech in Asia is a Singapore-based technology website and media and events company.

Prelude Duke Waiofar of Aquitaine sent his cousin, count Mantio, reinforced with Gascon levies and other magnates and their followings, to take the Frankish-held town of Narbonne in 763. Waiofar's plan was to ambush the Frankish garrison, deployed there against the Muslims, as it attempted to enter the town or leave it for home. Battle Counts Australdus and Galemanius, commanding the garrison, were leaving the town with their retinues, when Mantio's men and dismounted Gascon levies attacked them. After a bitter fight, Mantio and all his companions were killed by the Frankish counts. The Gascon levies were routed and the Franks pursued them, taking their horses and other belongings.

The Frankish army under King Pepin the Short conquered the town and accepted the surrender of nearby Albi and Gevaudan. Prelude In early 767 King Pepin the Short of Francia army marched through Aquitaine into Narbonne and moved on to besiege Toulouse. Bourges, conquered in 762 by Pepin, was the most important base for the campaign. Siege Toulouse was conquered and the nearby towns of Albi and Gevaudan submitted to Pepin without a fight. Aftermath Most and possibly all of the fortified places in Aquitaine were in Frankish hands by the end of 767. Pepin returned home and spent Easter at Vienne. He continued the war against Aquitaine in August 767. In the next year, King Pepin defeated the last few allies of Waiofar, Duke of Aquitaine (between 745-768), and then captured him and most of his family and executed them in public.Lewis, Archibald Ross (1965).

Observation history  NGC 592 was discovered by German astronomer Heinrich Louis d'Arrest on October 2, 1861. John Louis Emil Dreyer, compiler of the first New General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars, described NGC 592 as \\"faint\\" and \\"pretty large.\\"  Physical characteristics  NGC 592 is around ten times less luminous than NGC 604, a neighbouring emission nebula and one of the largest H II regions in the Local Group of galaxies. It is relatively close to the galactic centre of M33 and is located on the outer part of one of its spiral arms. The central region of NGC 592 is estimated to be 4.9 ¬± 0.5 million years old and have a stellar mass of 16500 ¬± 5200 M‚òâ.

Like most positional games, it is described by its set of positions/points/elements (X), and its family of winning-sets (\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\- a family of subsets of X). It is played by two players, called Waiter and Client. Each round, Waiter picks two elements, Client chooses one element and Waiter gets the other element (similarly to the Divide and choose protocol). In a Waiter-Client game, Waiter wins if he manages to occupy all the elements of a winning-set, while Client wins if he manages to prevent this, i.e., hold at least one element in each winning-set. So Waiter and Client have, respectively, the same goals as Maker and Breaker in a Maker-Breaker game; only the rules for taking elements are different. In a Client-Waiter game the winning conditions are reversed: Client wins if he manages to hold all the elements of a winning-set, while Waiter wins if he manages to hold at least one element in each winning-set.  Comparison to Maker-Breaker games  In some cases, the Waiter is much more powerful than the player with the same goal in the Maker-Breaker variant. For example, consider a variant of tic-tac- toe in which Maker wins by taking k squares in a row and Breaker wins by blocking all rows. Then, when the board is infinite, Waiter can win as Maker for any k >= 1. Moreover, Waiter can win as Breaker for any k >= 2: in each round, Waiter picks a pair of squares that are not adjacent to the pairs picked so far (for example, in round i he picks the squares (2i,0) and (2i,1)). Moreover, even when the board is finite, Waiter always wins as Breaker when k >= 8. This leads to the following conjecture by J√≥zsef Beck: If Maker wins the Maker-Breaker game on (X,\\\\mathcal{F}) when playing second, then Waiter wins the Waiter-Client game on (X,\\\\mathcal{F}). Similarly, if Breaker wins the Maker-Breaker game on (X,\\\\mathcal{F}) when playing second, then Waiter wins the Client-Waiter game on (X,\\\\mathcal{F}).  Special cases   k-uniform hypergraphs  Suppose the winning-sets are all of size k (i.e., the game-hypergraph is k-uniform). In a Maker-Breaker game, the Erdos- Selfridge theorem implies that Breaker wins if the number of winning-sets is less than 2^{k-1}. By the above conjecture, we would expect the same to hold in the corresponding Client-Waiter game - Waiter \\"should\\" win (as Breaker) whenever the number of winning-sets is less than 2^{k-1} . However, currently only the following weaker bounds are known: * Waiter wins if the number of winning-sets is less than {2^{k-1} \\\\over 8(k+1)} . * Waiter wins if the number of winning-sets is less than {2^{k-1} \\\\over 3\\\\sqrt{k+1/2}} .

A member of the Conservative People's Party, she was elected to the Folketing in 1945 and again in 1947. She was president of the Danish Women's Society (1948‚Äì1951) and chaired the Danish Women's Conservative Association (1951‚Äì1966). S√∏rensen was particularly interested in achieving equal rights for women in politics and education. Biography Born on 19 September 1896 in the Copenhagen district of Frederiksberg, Erna Bertha Cecilie Christensen was the daughter of Erik Peter Christensen (1855‚Äì1930) and Anna Christine Andreasen (1862‚Äì1927). In 1924, she married the auditor Marius S√∏rensen (1886‚Äì1965) with whom she had two children, Birthe Margrethe (1925) and Anna-Louise (1927). S√∏rensen graduated as a lawyer in 1921 and received authorization to practice in 1924. As a lawyer, she established her own practise in 1933 and in 1952 was assigned to the high court. On the political front, she joined the Copenhagen branch of Conservative Election Association in 1941. In 1945, together with two other women, Oda Christensen and Gudrun Hasselriis, she was elected to the Folketing, representing the Conservative People's Party. She was re-elected in 1947, becoming the only woman to represent the party until 1950. As a result, it was she who dealt with matters concerning families and women although she was also active in many other areas. From 1948 to 1951, as president of the Danish Women's Society, she revived interest in the organization which had lost members during the Second World War, doing all she could to improve conditions for women. Over the next 20 years, she was also played a prominent role in a number of other organizations dealing with women's employment, Nordic representation, apprenticeship and kindergartens. Her achievements both in politics and as a mother and housewife were widely appreciated. In 1955, she was honoured with the Order of the Dannebrog. Erna S√∏rensen died in H√∏rsholm on 18 January 1980.

Austria was a case held before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) case where the court upheld a domestic court's fine on an Austrian woman who had called Mohammed a pedophile. The applicant, E.S., is an Austrian national who was born in 1971 and lives in Vienna. In October and November 2009, Mrs S. held two seminars entitled ‚ÄúBasic Information on Islam‚Äù, in which she discussed the marriage between the Prophet Muhammad and a six- year old girl, Aisha, which was consummated when she was nine. Inter alia, the applicant stated that Muhammad ‚Äúliked to do it with children‚Äù and ‚Äú‚Ä¶ A 56-year-old and a six-year-old? ‚Ä¶ What do we call it, if it is not paedophilia?‚Äù. On 15 February 2011, the Vienna Regional Criminal Court found that these statements implied that Muhammad had had paedophilic tendencies, and convicted Mrs S. for disparaging religious doctrines. She was ordered to pay a fine of 480 euros and the costs of the proceedings. Mrs S. appealed but the Vienna Court of Appeal upheld the decision in December 2011, confirming in essence the lower court‚Äôs findings.  Original statement  The statement that the Austrian woman originally said was:  Court's decision  Only where expressions under Article 10 went beyond the limits of a critical denial, and certainly where they were likely to incite religious intolerance, might a state legitimately consider them to be incompatible with respect for the freedom of thought, conscience and religion and take proportionate restrictive measures. The court noted that the domestic courts comprehensively explained why they considered that the applicant‚Äôs statements had been capable of arousing justified indignation; specifically, they had not been made in an objective manner contributing to a debate of public interest (e.g. on child marriage), but could only be understood as having been aimed at demonstrating that Muhammad was not worthy of worship Furthermore, her statements were partly based on untrue facts and apt to arouse indignation in others. The national courts found that Mrs S. had subjectively labelled Muhammad with paedophilia as his general sexual preference, and that she failed to neutrally inform her audience of the historical background, which consequently did not allow for a serious debate on that issue. Hence, the court saw no reason to depart from the domestic courts‚Äô qualification of the impugned statements as value judgments which they had based on a detailed analysis of the statements made. The court held further that even in a lively discussion it was not compatible with Article 10 of the Convention to pack incriminating statements into the wrapping of an otherwise acceptable expression of opinion and claim that this rendered passable those statements exceeding the permissible limits of freedom of expression. The court's decision was unanimous without concurring opinion. In March 2019, the Grand Chamber panel of five judges rejected the request for referral to the Grand Chamber. The decision became final.  International reactions  The case was subject to criticism in public reporting, including the accusation that the judgment \\"imposed\\" a blasphemy law in Europe. Nevertheless, it was a source of concern for human rights commentators. The International Humanist and Ethical Union, an INGO concerned with humanist advocacy and repeal of blasphemy laws, was \\"frustrated\\" that the court did not uphold the complainant's Article 10 rights, criticising the court's \\"timidity\\". The British charity Humanists UK, which campaigns on similar issues internationally, criticised the ruling as \\"fundamentally at odds with the spirit and tradition of free expression in Europe\\" expressed hope the case would be appealed and overturned in the Grand Chamber. It criticised the court's rationale in balancing the Article 10 right it is sworn to protect against \\"a previously nonexistent right to protection of one‚Äôs ‚Äòreligious feelings‚Äô\\". In a later speech on blasphemy laws before the UN Human Rights Council, Humanists UK cited the Austria judgment as running \\"counter to the principles held by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to the spirit and purpose of human rights as an international enterprise.\\" Writing in The Atlantic, Simon Cottee expressed serious concerns about the judgment, saying \\"it has given legitimacy to what is in all but name an Austrian blasphemy law, and by invoking the slippery notion of ‚Äúreligious peace,‚Äù it has effectively given a veto to those who would deploy violence in defense of their religious beliefs.\\" Reactions from academics were varied. Some authors outlined that with this judgment the European Court of Human Right applied different standards to very similar situation ruled in the past. Moreover, no concrete offence to any individual was demonstrated, but only to the quite fuzzy and undefined \\"religious peace\\" of Austria, and even that only potentially. For that reason it has been claimed that this judgment de facto endorsed the use of anti-blasphemy laws.Andrea Gatti, \\"Freedom of Expression and Protection of Religious Peace in Europe: Considerations on E.S. v.

The aim is to be the first to completely shed all one's cards. The card ranking is Aces high i.e. A K Q J 10 9 8 7 (6 5 4 3 2). Players must follow suit and the highest card of the led suit wins the trick. The winner picks it up and discards the trick. There are no trumps. If a player is unable to follow suit he must pick up all the cards played to the current trick into their hand, and lead to the next. As soon as a player empties their hand, the game ends and that player is the winner. In early rules, there is no scoring system; however Parlett (2008) states that the winner scores the total of the cards in the other players hands with Ace to 10 at face value and court cards counting 10.

Kath-Kuni is an indigenous construction technique prevalent in the isolated hills of northern India, especially in the region of Himachal Pradesh. In Uttarakhand, a similar architectural style is known as Koti Banal (named after the village where during the 1991 Uttarkashi earthquake, the buildings made with traditional architecture largely remained unharmed). It is a traditional technique that uses alternating layers of long thick wooden logs and stone masonry, held in place usually without using mortar. It has been transmitted orally and empirically from one generation to the next, through apprenticeships spanning a number of years. The technique was devised keeping the seismic activity, topography, environment, climate, native materials and cultural landscape in perspective. Most of the oldest temples, in the region, are built using this ancient system. This unique construction technique has led to the formation of a vernacular architectural prototype known as Kath-Kuni (cator and cribbage) architecture.  Materials  The primary building materials employed in the construction are stone (igneous), wood and slate (metamorphic). Stone, usually granite, which is good in compression is used for foundational purposes. The walls are made of stone and wood which are alternatively stacked up, one over another. Wood which is good in compression and tension are interlocked in the corners with other wooden members. Deodar/Kali wood which is commonly available, is used as wall, flooring and roofing members. Slate, is used as a water proofing roofing material, employed to protect the building from heavy rain and snowfall. All the materials are locally available and are easily sourced.  Construction technique  Kath Kuni construction technique The construction typically involves laying courses whose outer layer comprises random rubble masonry and wood, laid out alternately. The walls are almost two feet thick in dimension and act as a cavity wall. After one course of random rubble there is a course of wood (only outer course), which is interlocked by dovetail random intermediate joints, to hold the wooden members in place. The courses alternate until a ceiling height is attained. The cavity wall of every outer course of wood/stone is filled with smaller stones within. They act as insulation fillers between the outer layers.  Applications  Kath-Kuni Architecture has widely been employed in the construction of residences. Here the farmers would rear their cattle in the lowermost floor such that the heat generated would heat the upper layers of the house. The next level of the dwelling unit is used as a granary, where food is stocked for the winters. The last few floors are designed as residential spaces which are cantilevered from the main walls of the house to capture sunlight, during the day. Hip roofs are usually employed but there are instances where gable with dormer windows are adopted. Good examples of Kath-Kuni Architecture could be seen in existing temples, where the craftmanship exhibited in the form of ornamentation and detailing in design, can be seen on the wooden members of walls, flooring, windows, doors and roofs. Construction Technique  Advantages  *Sustainable *Materials locally available *Suitable for seismic zones *Insulates during extreme weather conditions *Energy efficient *Helps sustain the livelihood of people who are mostly farmers or craftsmen *Employs local crafts and keeps the tradition alive *Himachal Pradesh, TemplesEmploys unskilled labour Disadvantages * Lack of availability of building materials * Time- consuming to construct * Laborious  Decline  Himachal Pradesh, Residence With urbanization and newer construction materials available in the market, that deliver buildings much faster, the traditional techniques started losing its relevance over time. Also, with rising demand for natural materials, the rapid loss of forest covers resulted in the enforcement of Environment Forest Act that banned the use of any more wood from the forests.

The extant north-west wing is a Grade II listed building The 17th-century gatehouse, the 19th century stables and other associated buildings are also listed. The house stands in a park about 2 miles in length. Hall The current building, originally the north-west wing of a larger complex, was built in 1846 by architect Edward Blore. The remainder of the house, dating from 1613, was destroyed by fire in 1956. It is built in red brick with stone dressings and plain tiled roofs. It comprises 2 storeys plus attic in the Jacobean style with a 5-bay frontage surmounted by 3 dormer windows. Gatehouse The gatehouse was built in 1613 and now serves as the estate office. It is built in two storeys of brick with ashlar dressings and a plain tiled roof. A semi circular doorway is flanked by paired Tuscan columns. Other features include a clock in central gable head and a central timber cupola. It is a Grade II* listed building. Stables Now used as flats and offices, the stables were built in 1898 by Milne and Hall of London. They are constructed in 2 and 3 storeys from brick with plain tiled roof. There is a timbered central entrance with double jetty and gabled timber framed upper storeys containing brick and brick nogging infill. They are a Grade II listed building. Other features Other listed 19th-century features of the estate include the shellhouse, a brick-built garden house by Edward Blore whose interior is faced entirely with seashells; the lodge, a one-storey building with a Greek-cross plan; and the brewery, now used as garages. History Merton Hall was built in 1613 on the site of a house which had been in possession of the de Grey family since the middle of the 14th century, and prior to that of their ancestors in the female line, the Baynards, to whom the property was granted at the time of William the Conqueror. Some portion of the older buildings still remain. Additions were made to the house in 1846 and 1876, and extensive stabling and a coachman's house were erected in 1889 or 1890. The older part of the house was destroyed by the 1956 fire. Members of the de Grey family who owned the estate included William de Grey (1652‚Äì1687), his son Thomas de Grey (1680‚Äì1765), and his son Thomas de Grey (1717-1781). All were local MPs for Thetford or for Norfolk. When the latter died childless the estate passed to his nephew Thomas de Grey, 2nd Baron Walsingham and thereafter descended in that family, via a succession of Barons Walsingham, to the present time.

The dwarsligger is published by Uitgeverij dwarsligger, part of Veen Bosch & Keuning Uitgeversgroep (VBK).  History  The dwarsligger was conceived by Hugo van Woerden, the director of the Dutch printer Jongbloed BV, a publishing house that specializes in printing on very thin paper that is commonly used for printing the Bible. The objective of this printing format was to deliver a new type of book that read pleasantly, was easy to carry, and did not collapse. Jongbloeddirecteur Van Woerden: sowing and then sleeping peacefully, Reformatorisch Dagblad , September 28, 2012 Jongbloed BV only focused on printing Christian books, a niche market that proved too small. To expand interest in the book style, Jongbloed BV granted a license to Ambo / Anthos publishers. The dwarsligger was registered as atrademark by Jongbloed BV in July 2006. On September 6, 2009, the first Dutch copy of the dwarsligger entered circulation. The first copy, the Manuscripta by Herman Koch, was awarded to Ronald Plasterk, Minister of Education, Culture and Science. Drukkerij Jongbloed launches Dwarsligger, Adformatie , September 3, 2009  Features  The special binding method permits the dwarsligger to remain open without restraint, and can be browsed and read with one hand. The use of thin papers reduces the amount of raw materials used by conventional books. The format is amenable to various types of books such as novels, thrillers and non-fiction. Published by Uitgeverij dwarsligger, the format has been used in various titles by authors such as Herman Koch, Saskia Noort, Paulien Cornelisse and Dan Brown. In some cases the dwarsligger appears at the same time as the regular edition.  International  In addition to the Dutch and Flemish market, they are also trying to launch the book format elsewhere. In 2010, the format entered the Spanish market Dwarslig is going international, Reformatorisch Dagblad, November 25, 2010 and one year later the English publisher Hodder & Stoughton published a few dwarsliggers, under the name Flipback .

Its maximum apparent visual magnitude is 10.44, but drops down to 10.93 during the main eclipse and to 10.71 during the secondary one. System The primary star has a spectral classification F3IV-V, matching the evidence for a star that is evolving off the main sequence and is expanding its radius. The secondary is thought to be a main sequence star with spectral type G0. It is not visible in the spectrum of DS Andromedae, but the temperature and spectral type can be estimated from the difference in brightness of the two components, determined from the eclipses. The two components are modelled to have apparent magnitudes of 10.62 and 12.47 respectively. The age of DS Andromedae appears to be very close to the hook at the end of main sequence phase of evolution and has just reached the subgiant branch. Its age can be determined at from the NGC 752 main sequence turnoff and this allows its physical properties to be accurately calculated. It appears to be not quite filling its roche lobe and no mass transfer has taken place between the two stars; they are evolving as isolated stars. Variability The light curve of DS Andromedae shows a main eclipse when the secondary star passes in front of the primary, and a secondary eclipse when the opposite occurs. This cycle repeats with a periodicity slightly over one day. Since the system is almost exactly edge-on the secondary eclipse is total, and allows the determination of the spectral type of the secondary component. The primary eclipse is annular as the smaller secondary passes in front of the hotter brighter primary. It is classified as an Algol variable (detached) star in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars, but is sometimes considered to be a Œ≤ Lyrae variable (contact).

Pamƒõti. Praha: Akropolis, 1996. S. 280. She was infamous for the rumours of her mistreatment of the serfs on the estates of her spouse, which she tended during his absences. She was brought to trial in 1533 and convicted for the murder of 14 people, though she was allegedly the murderer of 30 people. She was sentenced to imprisonment in a tower in Prague Castle. Life Kate≈ôina originated from a family of small- time landowners in Kom√°rov, but her rise to power came through her husband Jan Bechynƒõ z La≈æany, the burgrave of Karl≈°tejn, who resided in Piƒç√≠n and P≈ô√≠bram. Since the Bechynƒõ z La≈æany family was a vastly more important one, the wedding between Kate≈ôina and Jan meant a big social rise for the former. Since Jan held his office in Karl≈°tejn, the administration of his private estate was led by his wife. This proved a tough time for her serfs, because Kate≈ôina imposed severe punishments on them. Some of the tortured ones couldn't endure and died, and those who survived carried the consequences for the rest of their lives. Trial Jan Bechynƒõ had long had a protracted disagreement with the Dean of the Karl≈°tejn Chapter, Wenceslaus Hajek, who later became a respected chronicler. Rumors of Kate≈ôina's crimes eventually reached the Dean, and he informed her husband about them, but Jan took it as a provocation and sued Hajek. The court tribunal, chaired by Vojtƒõch I of Pernstein, decided to examine the claims in Piƒç√≠n in 1533. However, the summoned witnesses of the Piƒç√≠n serfs, afraid of being punished, described Mrs. Kate≈ôina as a kind and good lady in the official interrogations. That was until they reached a citizen of Prague, a relative of one of the victims (since he was from Prague, which was out of Mrs. Kate≈ôina's jurisdiction, he couldn't be harmed). He named the cruel woman as the killer of his relatives, and his example encouraged many other serfs, who changed their testimonies in accordance with the truth. Kate≈ôina eventually admitted to killing 14 of her serfs, but some of her servants suggested her victim count could be up to 30. Judgment and death The court tribunal passed an unusual sentence for Czech law - Mrs. Kate≈ôina was to be imprisoned and left in jail to her fate, basically left alone so she could starve to death. She was placed in the Mihulka Tower at Prague Castle, where she died in March 1534. Surprisingly, just two days after her death, her judge Vojtƒõch I of Pernstein also passed away. This has been the subject of speculation, with claims that Kate≈ôina had \\"dragged him down with her.\\" For Jan Bechynƒõ, the tragic case of his wife's crimes had no little effect on his life. After some time, he was appointed as high scribe and retained his position until his death in 1547.

Life and Work He graduated from the Department of Comparative Literature and Literary theory at the Faculty of Philology in Belgrade. He has been working as a head librarian in the Special library of the Faculty of Physical Chemistry of the University of Belgrade since 1999. He can certainly be regarded as a great unknown of contemporary Serbian literature, who has hitherto been unnoticed by the critics of the literary scene in his native country apart from a few exceptions. One of the few critics even used the claim that he would be a writer at the border of obscurity and cult, in the sense of an unknown author who is a literary recommendation of elitist circles only. Zlatoje Martinov titled his review of The Sins of Saint Max in the literary journal Bagdala of the same named circle with the headline: literary provocation sui generis, which dealt with the socio-political and cultural-philosophical dimension in Marƒçiƒáev's work. In fact, the author and his literary confrontation with his contemporaries, his generation, their and ultimately his culture, has not been made easy to get to the public with his work. Although he had already been awarded for the best academic thesis of the Philological Faculty upon graduation, and was then supported by a scholarship of the Pekiƒá Foundation (2002) and a bursary of the T√©not Foundation (2006), a total of nine publishers had refused to edit his first novel All the Lives of Zechariah Neuzinski (completed in 2002). Marƒçiƒáev writes his stories with an in-depth knowledge on literature and its literary genres, art history, history of philosophy and the general history of Europe. The first three novels, collectively called as the Weissenburg Threebook (Serbian: Vajzbur≈°kog troknji≈æja), are a trilogy from the irrational cabinet of curiosities of human beings. The plots of the narratives take place in Weissenburg, a city between Byzantium and Pannonia and the name of the city is the ancient German name for Belgrade, also two of the protagonists has conspicuously a German name (Max Eichmann and Victor Eisberg; Neuzinski is a neologism, combined with the German adjective new and a Slavic name suffix), all deftly applied alienation effects. The writer plays masterfully with the literary genres of Bildungsroman and autobiography from the canon of classical literatures, and even the titles of his novels creates associative connections to works such as Augustine‚Äôs Confessions, Goethe‚Äôs Poetry and Truth and his Conversations with Eckermann, Mann‚Äôs Confessions of Felix Krull or Hesse's Demian. All three novels are metaphorical confrontations with the socio- political upheavals of his country and the entire Balkans region, biographies of fictional characters whose lives are told on the one hand autobiographically and on the other biographically by contemporary witnesses or by a demiurge. They are stories about the status of culture, its actual value, its traditions and the individuals who live in it, constantly re-create and influence it through their own activities and attitudes. German history has some examples of persons who have transformed the cultural cabinet of curiosities into a chamber of nightmares: Are these places of mind called Buchenwald, Srebrenica or Weissenburg? However, this real question might be a future provocation, because these places should be alienation effects of a fictitous culture only, which no longer exists in any present. The fourth novel tells about the lives of four friends from Vo≈ædovac, who have known each other since their youth, in the mirror of historical events and radical changes such as the death of Tito, the Gazimestan speech by Milo≈°eviƒá, the Yugoslav wars, the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and the assassination of Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá.Academic staff, Faculty of Physical Chemistry, retrieved 2018-10-31.Scholarships, Pekiƒá Foundation, retrieved 2018-10-31.Review, Stereo Art, retrieved 2018-10-31.Review in literary journal Bagdala, No. 478/2008, p. 123-126.Review, Danas, retrieved 2018-10-31.

The film stars Jayam Ravi and Raashi Khanna with Sampath Raj, Ponvannan, Ramdoss, Mime Gopi, and Azhagam Perumal in supporting roles. The score and soundtrack was composed by Sam C. S., while cinematography and editing was handled by Sathyan Sooryan and Anthony L. Ruben respectively. The film began production in December 2017 and released on 21 December 2018.  Plot  Subhash is a sincere and new Sub- Inspector of Police in Chennai. He resides with his father, mother, elder brother, his wife, and their twin daughters. He is all set to marry his fianc√©e Anitha. He is new to his job and is assisted by Constable Ramadass and SSI Chandran. Subhash cannot stand the suffering of the public and looks for ways to better their lives, and this often lands him in trouble with his superior Inspector Muthukaruppan. One day, Chandran and Subhash are called on to investigate the supposed suicide of a girl. On closer investigation, Subhash deduces that it was not a suicide and that she was murdered. While collecting evidence to support this, he comes across a person called Abhijit (Bharath Raj), whose cell number was active near the place. On confronting Abhijit and his friends Christy, Bhuvanesh, and Deepak, they reveal that they are all stoners from affluent families and show a video of them doing drugs, raping and murdering the girl and many other women, as well. Subhash gets enraged, beats them up, and locks them in jail. When his superior, a corrupt Joint Commissioner Saarangan IPS, asks for the proof behind his accusations, he finds out that the phone had automatically deleted all the video files just as he was trying to unlock it. The four are released due to lack of evidence and the influence of their respective fathers and Subhash is suspended. Abhijit and his friends vow revenge and soon enough, when Subhash goes home, he finds his parents and brother's family dead. Only one of his nieces, Anusha, is left alive. Meanwhile, Saarangan is bribed with an expensive and luxurious Porsche SUV car and reports the murder of Subhash's family as a fire accident at their new house. Dejected at his powerlessness even though he is a police officer, Subhash resigns and threatens Saarangan that he will avenge his family's death and will make sure that the four guys die mercilessly at the hands of their own fathers. First, he kidnaps Bhuvan and locks him in a car with a mechanism that fills silane gas in it if anyone tries to open the door. Bhuvan's father, the district collector, accidentally opens the car door as he searches for his missing son, and Bhuvan is burnt alive in front of his father. Next, he kidnaps Deepak and Christy and keeps them at undisclosed locations. The police, in order to find the missing guys, try to unofficially arrest Subhash at gunpoint, but he triggers Muthukaruppan's pistol on purpose, resulting in his arrest and gaining unwanted public attention. With increasing media and political attention, Saarangan and the rich fathers are unable to carry out extreme measures of interrogation on Subhash, though he is in custody. Subhash then reveals to all of them that he kept Christy in a van and asks him to go to the airport, but Christy's father double crosses Subhash and asks him to run for help, thinking that Christy is safe when police and the public are nearby. Before Christy could do so, an auto-loaded gun in his bag starts beeping, and Christy, assumed to be a terrorist, is brutally shot and killed by the Paramilitary Force (CISF) soldiers to safeguard the public. After this, Deepak is found to be locked in a glass tank connected to harmful chemicals. Subhash and his tech friend expose him as a rapist to the public via an online gaming link, where the public can virtually try to shoot at Deepak in order to release the chemicals into the tank and eventually kill him. His father hires hackers to stop this, and when Deepak's location is found, he goes there and breaks open the tank to release him, but the chemicals instantly blow up, and he is killed. Meanwhile, Subhash also threatens Saarangan to check on his teenage daughter's safety. Saarangan panics but is relieved when she is found to be safe. Saarangan realises his mistake and decides to support Subhash in his fight for justice to the rape and murder victims. Now that only Abhijit is left, his father Sanjay, a business tycoon, decides to release Subhash from custody and deal with him alone. Subhash tactfully kidnaps Abhijit and has him hanging on a rope. He also threatens to upload the video evidence online and expose their crimes, thereby bringing Sanjay's business empire down. He gives Sanjay an ultimatum that he could either hold on to the rope and save his son or let go and shut down the laptop instead, to save his reputation. In the end, the power-hungry Sanjay decides to save his reputation and lets go of the rope, killing Abhijit. One year later, Subhash has become a peace-loving IPS officer, who murders criminals out of record to serve justice.  Cast  *Jayam Ravi as S. Subash *Raashi Khanna as Anitha *Sampath Raj as J. C. P.

The player controls a human, Kris, in a town inhabited by monsters. Kris and a classmate named Susie fall into an unknown place called the \\"Dark World\\" where they meet Ralsei, who informs them that they are heroes destined to save the world. The trio meets various beings who call themselves \\"Darkners\\" during a prophesied quest to seal the duplicate Dark Fountain. Mainly through the combat system, the player navigates through different kinds of bullet hell attacks by enemies, which can be resolved peacefully or through violence. Development of Deltarune began in 2012. The battle system was overhauled from Fox's previous game Undertale, resembling the one used in Final Fantasy games. The first chapter of the game was released for free on October 31, 2018 for Microsoft Windows and macOS; the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 editions were released on February 28, 2019. A full release is planned, but no release date has been announced yet. The soundtrack, characters and sense of humor was praised by critics, with mixed reactions towards its similarities to Undertale.  Gameplay  left Like Undertale, Deltarune is a role-playing game with a top-down perspective. The player directly controls a human named Kris, but they may also select actions for other characters in the game. Similarly to Undertale, Deltarune includes puzzles and bullet hell sections in which the player must move a heart around a boxed area while avoiding attacks. Undertale's random encounter system has been removed; players can now see the enemies directly on the field, allowing for the possibility of avoiding them. Combat is turn-based. Players can choose from a set of actions each turn such as fight, act, spare, using an item, or defend, which reduces incoming damage. Brushing against attacks without touching them increases the Tension Points (TP) gauge, which allow party members to use spells. For example, Ralsei can pacify enemies by singing them to sleep. When a party member's hit points (HP) reaches 0, they become downed and will not be able to fight anymore. The HP of downed party members will regenerate automatically until it reaches 1; healing items or Ralsei's healing spell will also revive them. While the goal of the game is implicitly to avoid fights and spare monsters, this is made difficult in that Susie‚Äîwho is not initially controlled by the player‚Äîwould attack enemies rather than spare them, and thus the player must also warn enemies of Susie's attacks if they want to show mercy. Story Upon starting the game, the player is invited to construct an avatar. However, upon completion, the game deletes the avatar and informs the player that \\"No one can choose who they are in this world.\\" The player begins the story as Kris, a human child living in a village mostly made up of monster residents, with their adoptive mother Toriel, who is also a monster. Toriel drops Kris off at school, where Kris attends a class taught by Alphys. Kris and Susie, a delinquent monster classmate, are sent to get chalk for the blackboard. Upon entering the supply closet, both of them are pulled into the \\"Dark World\\". There, they meet Ralsei, a prince of the dark, who tells them that the three of them are heroes destined to close the Dark Fountain (a geyser of dark energy) to restore balance to that world. However, the King has seized control of the Dark World and is determined to spread darkness. Susie chooses not to help, only wanting to return to her own world. Before she can leave, the three encounter the King's son Lancer, who tries to stop them from proceeding with various poorly thought out plans. Susie eventually decides to join Lancer, leaving Kris and Ralsei on their own. As Kris and Ralsei make their way to the King's castle, Susie befriends Lancer, and the four ultimately become a team. Upon realizing that they will have to confront the King, Lancer runs off to the castle and arranges for the King's henchmen to throw Kris, Ralsei, and Susie into the dungeon. Susie escapes the dungeon and confronts Lancer, who explains he wanted to keep Susie and the King from hurting each other. Susie promises Lancer she won't hurt the King. Kris, Susie and Ralsei go to the top of the castle and confront the King in battle. Eventually, the King falls to the ground in exhaustion and Ralsei takes pity on him, healing the King. However, this is revealed to be a ruse as the King quickly incapacitates the three heroes, threatening to kill them all. If the player has resolved enemy encounters without violence throughout the game, Lancer turns the King's men against him and imprisons him, taking his father's place as king of the Dark World. Otherwise, Susie subdues the King using Ralsei's Pacify spell. Kris closes the Dark Fountain so that they can return to their own world. There, Susie says goodbye, expressing interest in returning to the Dark World. The player can explore the town before having Kris go home to bed. That night, Kris shakes in bed, then falls on the floor and limps to the center of the room. Kris tears into their chest and rips out their heart-shaped SOUL, throwing it into a birdcage in the corner of the room. The player can move the SOUL around inside the birdcage, but cannot do anything else. Kris draws a knife and turns toward the viewer. They smile, with their right eye flashing red.  Development and release  The idea for Deltarune came to Toby Fox in a dream he had in 2011 while he was at college. In the dream, he saw the ending to a video game and was determined to create it. Fox was also inspired by a collection of playing card designs posted on Tumblr by artist Kanotynes, which were used in the final game. Development of the game started in 2012, although it was abandoned before Fox created the first room. Some music from the original project was recycled for Undertale, most notably the main battle theme (which became Papyrus' battle theme, Bonetrousle), and a song called Joker Battle (which was reused for the Toriel fight as Heartache). After the Kickstarter success of Undertale, Fox decided to make a game combining the two. Various factors such as the graphics, overhauled combat system and Fox's mental state make Deltarune a more challenging game to produce compared to Undertale. Temmie Chang, who previously assisted Fox with character art in Undertale, served as the main artist for the Deltarune. She helped design characters, sprites and animations. Fox came up with Susie's design after having played Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. He originally based her off Maya Fey and she would act \\"nice and cute\\". However, as her design progressed, she eventually turned into more of a \\"thug\\". Fox stated that he planned to give an unnamed character a fire spell which they wouldn't be good at using, but decided against adding it in the first chapter. Deltarune was developed by Fox in GameMaker Studio 2. The game introduces a new battle system comparable to the one used in the Final Fantasy franchise, contrasting with the original game's combat system (which shared similarities with that of the Mother series). Some of the music in the game remixes portions of the Undertale soundtrack, but most pieces are new. Unlike Undertale, Fox plans for Deltarune to have only one ending. After previously teasing something Undertale-related a day earlier, Fox released the first chapter of Deltarune, a game \\"intended for people who have completed Undertale\\", on October 31, 2018, for Windows and macOS for free. Fox stated that this release is the first part of a new project, and considered the release a \\"survey program\\" to determine how to take the project further. Fox clarified that Deltarune will be a larger project than Undertale and once he anticipates getting a team to help develop and more, and when it is ready, will release the game as one whole package. Deltarune merchandise was announced on November 2018 in collaboration with Fangamer, including T-shirts, a poster, a plushie and a pin set. A Nintendo Direct released on February 13, 2019, announced that the first chapter of Deltarune would be released on Nintendo Switch on February 28. On February 21, 2019, the official PlayStation Twitter account announced that a PlayStation 4 version of the first chapter would also be released on February 28. The Switch and PS4 versions were developed and published by 8-4. Reception The first chapter of Deltarune garnered a lot of comparisons to Undertale. Jason Schreier of Kotaku and Dominic Tarason of Rock, Paper, Shotgun compared it favorably. Schreier praised the refinements of Undertale elements, calling it \\"a refreshing return\\"; Tarason agreed, saying that Deltarune is \\"a higher- budget production\\". Although Mitchell Parton of Nintendo World Report thought that Deltarune \\"doesn‚Äôt significantly change up the formula\\", he did not have a problem with it. Nintendo Life's Mitch Vogel was less positive, being disappointed that after how \\"fresh\\" Undertale was at its release, Deltarune ended up being \\"‚Äòjust‚Äô more of the same\\". A significant amount of praise was aimed at the music, with Schreier claiming that \\"The soundtrack should be enough of a selling point.\\" Tarason found that the music had \\"a fresh new edge to it\\" whereas Parton described it as \\"emotional and solid\\" and expressed surprise at it being composed by one person. Adam Luhrs of RPGFan praised Toby's \\"clever use of motifs\\", feeling that they were incorporated well in Deltarune's story. Gamespot's Michael Higham pointed out similarities between Deltarune and Undertale's music, believing that they're \\"callbacks to remind you that these two worlds are somehow bound together\\". Video game music group Materia Collective released the official 40-track soundtrack, composed by Toby Fox, and featuring composer-songwriter Laura Shigihara on the best-selling single Don't Forget. Fangamer released a 1-LP vinyl record on July 11, 2019.https://blipblop.net/fangamer-are-taking-preorders-for-the-deltarune- vinyl-soundtrack/ Tarason liked the game's pixel art, calling it \\"more detailed and expressive\\" compared to Undertale, a sentiment which Parton agreed with. Higham further elaborated that's Deltarune's ability to \\"communicate so much with so little\\" is one of its greatest strengths and that the \\"character expressions and body language provide vivid displays of personality\\". The gameplay was also generally well received, with Parton calling it \\"unique\\" and Vogel describing the combat as \\"an organic and well- implemented expansion of the original\\". Some criticism was given by Higham, referring to some sequences ‚Äì such as the Card Castle ‚Äì as \\"a bit barebones\\". Allegra Frank of Polygon mentioned that Deltarune's sense of humor is one of its \\"defining features\\". Vogel concurred, calling the humor \\"witty\\" and the story \\"compelling\\". Higham stated that \\"you'll be smiling ear-to-ear from the witty writing, snappy jokes, and absurdist humor\\". Parton and Tarason focused more on the character designs, with Tarason praising the \\"fresh (and lovable) set of characters\\" and Parton asserting that their designs range from \\"undeniably adorable to nightmarishly disturbing\\". Vogel was critical of the way that the Dark World was implemented, opining that despite it looking slightly better than Undertale, it \\"hardly feels like a cohesive or living place\\". He also criticized the \\"sparsely decorated hallways with very little in the way of interesting design or presentation\\", ending his criticism by saying that \\"Deltarune is unfortunately not a very pretty game to look at.\\" Parton also listed the game's infrequent save points as a negative in his summary. Awards The game soundtrack was nominated for the Game Audio Network Guild / MAGFest People's Choice Award at the 2019 G.A.N.G. Awards.

Life  Born in Paris, Baschet began her musical studies at the √âcole normale de musique de Paris and at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, then in musicology, in harmony and counterpoint in Paris. She entered the Conservatoire national sup√©rieur musique et danse de Lyon in 1988 (SONVS department) where she studied musical composition and sound transformations by electroacoustic means. In 1991, she won the First prize in composition and computer music. She then took advanced courses at the Acanthes Center with Luigi Nono and then with Elliott Carter. In 1992, she joined the IRCAM as part of the composition and computer music curriculum. She then received numerous commissions, including from the IRCAM, Radio France, the Ensemble 2e2m and the Groupe de recherches musicales, the Festival Manca, the Festival Why Note and the Ensemble l'Itin√©raire whose artistic director and composer Michael Levinas actively supported her work. She was appointed composer in residence at the M.I.A. and the from 2003 to 2005, then in 2005 in Dijon with the Ensemble L'Itin√©raire and in 2006 at the Grame in Lyon. In 2007, she was appointed composer in research at the Ircam, an institute for which she wrote a string quartet and device, created in 2008 by the Danel Quartet. One of the guiding principles of her work is the critical integration of a natively instrumental vocabulary into her writing.

The player controls the protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque, through a series of levels, using various weapons to fight enemies as well as encountering various non-playable characters. It is a remake of MediEvil, which was originally developed by British video game developer SCE Cambridge Studio and released for the PlayStation in 1998. The MediEvil remake was first announced as a remaster of MediEvil in late 2017. It was later reannounced as a remake in late 2018. The developers of MediEvil took advantage of the advances in technology since the original MediEvil to enhance aspects, while trying to avoid straying too far from the presentation of the original. Additional features not present in the original were included in the remake. The MediEvil remake was released in October 2019. Various bonus content was included in special editions. MediEvil received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its presentation, but criticized some aspects of its gameplay. Gameplay Sir Daniel Fortesque encountering a Rhinotaur in the \\"Crystal Caves\\" level. The optional \\"Dan Cam\\" camera viewpoint is being used. MediEvil takes place across a series of levels selectable from a world map of Gallowmere. The game's playable character, Sir Daniel Fortesque is able to utilize a variety of weapons, ranging from close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long- range weapons such as throwing daggers and bows, many of which can be charged for a more powerful attack. When not possessing any weapons, Sir Daniel is able to use his arm for melee and ranged attacks. Sir Dan is also able to equip a shield alongside his weapons for defense, though they can only resist a limited amount of damage and do not protect Dan from certain types of damage, such as from long falls. As Sir Dan is hit by enemies, he will lose part of his health bar; If his entire health bar is depleted, the game will end. While Sir Dan does not recover health automatically between levels, he can utilize Life Bottles to automatically recover all of his health should it be completely depleted. Sir Dan is able to encounter two varieties of gargoyle heads throughout the game: green gargoyles offer Sir Dan information, while blue gargoyles offer him ammunition for his weapons in exchange for gold he finds. In each level, Sir Dan is able to find a chalice of Souls, which can be collected if the player has defeated enough enemies. Dan can use the chalices to gain access to the Hall of Heroes, where he can talk to one of several non- playable characters to receive a new weapon or other item. If Sir Dan collects all chalices, the game's true ending will be shown. While the game remains largely identical in content to the original MediEvil, several new features have been introduced. This includes the ability to toggle between a primary and secondary weapon, first introduced as a feature in MediEvil 2, the \\"Dan Cam\\", an optional camera viewpoint which uses an over-the-shoulder perspective, and a compendium of information about the game's characters and enemies, known as the Book of Gallowmere. Optional \\"Lost Souls\\" objectives have also been incorporated into the game, which require Sir Dan to complete a mission received from a ghost found in each level; if all Lost Souls objectives are completed, the player unlocks the option to play the original MediEvil on the menu screen, under the name of \\"Old Game\\". Development According to the executive producer of the MediEvil remake, Jeff Nachbauer, Other Ocean Emeryville wished to keep most elements from the original MediEvil intact, unless they felt there was a good reason to change something; this included the retention of several glitches present in the original MediEvil, which were considered by the developers to be crucial to the feel of the game. The developers researched music the original developers would have listened to at the time of the development of the original MediEvil. Level geometry was extracted from the original MediEvil and imported into the remake's engine to serve as a reference for the placement of level elements. Due to the game's farther draw distance and wider aspect ratio, new background areas that didn't exist in the original MediEvil needed to be created, and additional trees and foliage were added to certain areas. Enemy behaviors left in the source code of the original MediEvil, but removed from the finished game due to time constraints were restored for the MediEvil remake. The game is dedicated to Zarok's voice actor, Paul Darrow, who died on 3 June 2019.  Character design  Art director Nick Bruty felt that it was crucial to keep the feel of the original MediEvil in Sir Daniel Fortesque's design, while still adding additional detail and shape to the originally low-resolution 3D model from the original game. Sir Dan's arms were made longer, as they were considered to look strange in the higher resolution of the MediEvil remake. Sir Dan's armor was redesigned to be more grounded in design while still accommodating for Sir Dan's animations. Initially, they had given Dan's armor a cleaner design, but made his armor more tattered later in development. The design of Sir Dan's skull went through several iterations, with the finalized design intending to strike a balance between the more gritty design of the original MediEvil and the more humorous design of MediEvil: Resurrection. Due to advances in technology since the development of the original MediEvil, Other Ocean was able to create a wider range of expressions for Sir Dan compared to the original game.  Voice acting  Most in-game dialogue was recycled from the original MediEvil (the only exception to this is Zarok's command of \\"Fire!\\" in the cinematic showing what had really happened to Dan). Jason Wilson, the voice actor of Sir Dan in MediEvil and MediEvil: Resurrection, reprised his role; unlike the original MediEvil, where Sir Dan's muffled voice effect was created by recording his lines while wearing a bucket, the effect was instead post-processed for the MediEvil remake. Tom Baker was replaced as the voice of the narrator by Lani Minella.  Music  Andrew Barnabas and Paul Arnold, who had previously composed the soundtrack for the previous three games in the series, returned to compose for the MediEvil remake. The music of the MediEvil remake was orchestrated by Prague Symphony Orchestra. The game's soundtrack consists of remastered versions of music that appeared in MediEvil: Resurrection, orchestral arrangements of tracks from the original MediEvil, and new tracks composed exclusively for the MediEvil remake. Release The MediEvil remake was first announced as a remaster of MediEvil at the 2017 PlayStation Experience. MediEvil was fully revealed on October 31, 2018, and was confirmed to be a full remake, rather than a remaster as was previously announced. In the May 9, 2019 PlayStation State of Play, the digital only \\"Digital Deluxe Edition\\" version was revealed, which includes the Super Armor from MediEvil 2 (which now increases the gold that Sir Dan earns), a theme based on the game for the PlayStation 4 user interface, a digital art book, a digital graphic novel prequel known as MediEvil: Fate's Arrow, and a digital music player featuring the game's soundtrack. In the September 24, 2019 PlayStation State of Play, a demo of MediEvil, known as MediEvil: Short-Lived Demo, was announced to be available from the end of the presentation until October 6, 2019. The demo features an unlockable helmet item that can carry over to the full game. The helmet is based on the Japanese version of the original MediEvil, which has Sir Dan wear a helmet by default, and also increases the game's difficulty level. A version of the Short-Lived Demo with additional levels was released on December 20, 2019.  Reception  MediEvil received mixed reviews from critics. It received an aggregate score of 67/100 from review aggregator Metacritic based on 72 critics, indicating mixed or average reviews. Praise was directed at the game's visual design, which was considered to be faithful to the original MediEvil, and the character, setting, and story of the game. Aspects of MediEvils gameplay design were often considered by critics to feel outdated, in particular the game's lack of a checkpoint mechanic. Some game's mechanics such as the instant death upon falling into water was also subject to criticism, and are aggravated by the unreliable controls and cameras. Combat was also criticized as being frustrating and imprecise. IGN's Travis Northup considered MediEvils \\"relentlessly charming story\\" as its greatest strength, and praised the added details and personality to the game's visuals and audio, but described the game's combat as \\"sloppy and disorienting\\". GameSpot's James Swinbanks, while also praising characters and visual style, shared similar concerns about the combat as well as other basic tasks which are made difficult by the sloppy controls and camera movements. Destructoid's Chris Carter felt that people who did not like the original MediEvil would not like the remake either, and thought the game's combat mechanics \\"might be a little too retro for modern audiences\\", comparing them to older hack-and-slash games such as Golden Axe. Game Informer's Andrew Reiner thought that MediEvils combat system felt imprecise, and compared the game unfavorably to other remakes such as Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy and Spyro Reignited Trilogy. In line with the other reviews, GamesRadar+ and VideoGamer.com praised the visuals, but criticized the outdated game design.  Sales  In the United Kingdom, MediEvil was the fifth best selling game in its week of release. On 5 November 2019, MediEvil was listed as the third best-selling game of the week in a chart in the combined download and retail encompassing 43 countries.

Cain is remembered for ramming the German U-boat SM UC-26 on the night of 16 February 1917, whilst in command of the Mona's Queen.Isle of Man Times, Saturday, September 03, 1932; Page: 2Ramsey Courier, Friday, September 02, 1932; Page: 5Mona's Herald, Tuesday, August 30, 1932; Page: 8 Early life William Cain, always known as Willie, was born in the village of Union Mills on the Isle of Man and educated at Braddan Parish School. On leaving school he gained his first experience of the sea with the Manx herring fleet, sailing to Kinsale and northern Scotland in the days when herring fishing was an important industry on the Isle of Man. Career Cain widened his seafaring experience by joining the Merchant Navy, being based in Liverpool where he rose to the rank of boatswain. Following his time sailing internationally Cain joined the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company as an ordinary seaman in 1883, serving on the Fenella until he was appointed Second Officer on the Snaefell in 1889. Cain was promoted to First Officer in 1893, and sailed as First Officer on most of the Company's vessels until 1905. RMS Ellan Vannin, Captain Cain's first command. Having taken his Liverpool Pilot's certificate in 1903 Cain was promoted to Captain, his first command being that of the Ellan Vannin which he assumed on 19 June 1905. Capt. Cain stayed with the Ellan Vannin until the beginning of December 1909, transferring command to Captain James Teare on 2 December, the day before the Ellan Vannin was lost in Liverpool Bay, going down with the loss of all on board. In the following years Cain commanded all the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company's ships, and in 1918 he was promoted to Commodore flying his pennant in the King Orry before transferring to the Ben-my-Chree following her introduction into service in 1927; remaining in command of her until his death. On one occasion it is recalled that he had trouble raising the Ben-my-Chree's anchor, so he subsequently took the ship down the Mersey stern first, despite the heavy shipping traffic on the river, bringing her alongside the Pier Head. It was said of him that his knowledge of the intricacies of the River Mersey was without equal. Mona's Queen on war service. War service During the Great War Capt. Cain was in command of the Mona's Queen being engaged in trooping duties between Southampton and Le Havre. On the night of 16 February 1917 the Mona's Queen left Southampton at 23:50 hours with a full complement of troops embarked. At a position approximately 12 nautical miles from Le Havre, a German U-boat was observed approximately 500 yards ahead of the Mona's Queen. Captain Cain continued ahead at full speed until when within 30 yards the U-boat fired a torpedo which narrowly missed the vessel; a few seconds later the U-boat was struck by the port paddle wheel of the Mona's Queen. Although it was widely regarded that SM UC-26 was sunk by the ramming, it subsequently transpired that although damaged by the action the U-boat was still able to remain on station and subsequently continued its mine laying sortie, resulting in the sinking of the French naval trawler Noella the following day. During the action the Mona's Queen had sustained significant damage, resulting in her starboard paddle box being almost submerged. With only one paddle wheel working, Capt. Cain exhibited some fine seamanship in being able to bring the vessel slowly into port. He subsequently took the Mona's Queen back to Southampton under her own steam, the journey taking 18 hours, instead of the usual 8 hours. The crew of the Mona's Queen received ¬£1,000 from the AdmiraltyIsle of Man Examiner, Friday, May 03, 1935; Page: 21 in recognition of the action and in addition the Freemasons of the Isle of Man presented Capt. Cain with a suitably inscribed rose bowl to commemorate the action. Personal life William Cain was said to of been a quiet and retiring person, well respected by all who knew him. For many years he was a member of the Athol Lodge of Freemasons as well as a lifelong member of the Mona Union Tent of Rechabites. William Cain married Isabel Collister on Saturday 5 April 1884,Manx Sun, Saturday, April 12, 1884; Page: 4 the wedding taking place at Kirk Braddan. They made their family home at \\"Neston\\", Thorny Rad, Douglas. The marriage produced four children; three daughters and a son. Their son, also named William Cain, followed in his father's footsteps by joining the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company whilst their daughter Emily died in infancy. RMS Ben-my-Chree, the flagship of the IOM Steam Packet Company in which Capt. Cain sailed as Commodore Death William Cain was in command of the Ben-my- Chree when she arrived in Douglas from Belfast on 27 August 1932. The sailing was part of a day excursion, ferrying employees of Harland & Wolff to the Isle of Man. Between the arrival and departure Capt. Cain went home to spend a few hours. However he took ill and died suddenly, the cause of his death being heart disease. Funeral The funeral of Captain Willie Cain took place on 30 August 1932. The cortege left the family home and proceeded to St Ninian's Church where his funeral service was conducted. Following the service his body was laid to rest in Braddan Parish Cemetery. The funeral service was attended by numerous dignitaries and high-ranking members of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, and included the entire ship's company from the Ben-my-Chree. Captain Cain's coffin was carried by 8 fellow Captains of the company who acted as pallbearers.

Wohl has been involved, along with conservative lobbyist and conspiracy theorist Jack Burkman, in multiple plots that attempted to frame public figures for fictitious sexual assaults, including in October 2018 against U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, in April 2019 against 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, and in April 2020 against White House Coronavirus Task Force member Anthony Fauci. Wohl has created and promulgated other false or unfounded claims and conspiracy theories, mainly against Democratic Party politicians such as Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris, Ilhan Omar, and Elizabeth Warren. To aid his schemes, Wohl has created multiple fake private intelligence agencies, and has fabricated death threats and protests against himself. On February 26, 2019, Twitter permanently banned him for violating its rules regarding creating and operating fake accounts. Facebook and Instagram permanently banned Wohl on August 31, 2020, also for violating rules about creating deceptive accounts. Wohl founded several investment funds as a teenager. The National Futures Association (NFA) banned Wohl for life in 2017, after investigating multiple investor complaints against him and concluding that Wohl was guilty of refusing to cooperate with the NFA as required, misrepresenting investments, and misleading investors. Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) charged Wohl with 14 counts of securities fraud in the same year, and ordered him to pay $32,919 in restitution. In August 2019, felony arrest warrants were issued in California for Wohl and his former business partner, Matthew Johnson, for illicit sale of securities that took place in July and August 2016.Zhao, Christina (September 4, 2019) \\"Who Is Jacob Wohl? Far-Right Conspiracy Theorist, Internet Troll Wanted on Felony Arrest Warrant\\" Newsweek Wohl pleaded not guilty to two felony charges of selling unregistered securities in February 2020. The settlement hearing that was originally scheduled for April 2020 was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On October 1, 2020, Wohl and Burkman were each charged with four felonies related to voter intimidation by the Michigan Department of Justice, related to an August 2020 robocall campaign allegedly originated by Wohl and Burkman. Activities Investment funds, sanctions, and legal action Wohl founded investment funds Wohl Capital Investment Group (WCIG), NeX Capital Management (NeX), and Montgomery Assets, Inc. (MAI) as a teenager. He posted Craigslist ads for \\"Wohl Girls,\\" models who were hired to help attract clients, and a number of \\"salacious\\" websites including \\"WohlGirls.com\\" were registered to his name. One model alleged that Wohl posted photographs of her online without her permission. In 2016, the National Futures Association (NFA) investigated NeX Capital Management after receiving an investor complaint. The investor said that Wohl had said his $75,000 investment had grown, but paid only $44,000 when the investor demanded the money be returned. Wohl claimed that the difference was due to losses, but the NFA found that Wohl's trading accounts \\"appeared to have made, not lost, money overall\\". Some of the money, the NFA alleged, had been diverted into his mother's brokerage accounts. The NFA said Wohl made an unbalanced presentation of profit potential and risk of loss to clients, and had misled investors by claiming to have been trading for ten years, which would have been since he was nine years old. Wohl hid from NFA investigators when they came to his house. Wohl's father, an attorney, threatened to sue the NFA for harassment. In 2017, the NFA banned Wohl for life. In 2017, the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) issued a cease-and- desist order to Wohl, WCIG, NeX, and MAI after it found they were in violation of securities laws. The ACC charged Wohl and his companies with 14 counts of securities fraud, including falsely representing investment risks, misrepresenting the amounts of assets managed, and falsely claiming in online advertisements on Craigslist that he, then 18, and his partner, then 27, had \\"over 35 years flipping homes\\". Wohl at one point claimed that he was managing 178 client accounts and combined total assets under management (AUM) of as much as $10,000,000, although the ACC said that he only had thirteen clients and an AUM of around $500,000. Wohl was ordered by the ACC to pay $32,919 in restitution and $5,000 in penalties. In May 2020, the ACC announced that they were working with the Arizona attorney general's office to \\"actively pursu[e] collection efforts against Mr. Wohl,\\" who has not made any payments towards the fines. On September 4, 2019, it was announced that on August 9, the Riverside Superior Court in Riverside County, California had issued felony arrest warrants for Wohl and his former business partner, Matthew Johnson, on charges of unlawful sale of securities. The Riverside County District Attorney's Office alleges that Wohl and Johnson violated California law by selling unqualified securities through a phony company called Montgomery Assets between July 27 and August 27, 2016. The investigation began in June 2016, when the Riverside County district attorney's office received a complaint from a man who had lost $75,000 that he had invested through the Wohl Capital Investment Group. The man later died by suicide. In July 2016, Wohl and Johnson were running the Montgomery Assets asset management firm. An investigator from the district attorney's office contacted them, claiming to represent a client who was interested in investing with the firm. According to the 2019 arrest warrant, the investigation resulted in what \\"appeared to be an offer to sell a security\\" that was unregistered. Wohl was taken into custody on August 19, 2019. After a brief appearance in court, he was released until arraignment. On February 24, Wohl pleaded not guilty to two felony charges of selling unregistered securities. The settlement hearing was scheduled for April 21, 2020 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Surefire Intelligence In 2018, Wohl created and registered the company Surefire Intelligence, LLC. Reporters who investigated Surefire Intelligence's website and company in October 2018, in relation to an alleged plot to frame Robert Mueller for sexual assault, found that the company had been created by Wohl just a few weeks earlier and that its official phone number redirected to a voicemail message which provided a phone number owned by Wohl's mother. They also reported that photographs on the website depicting some of its purported employees were actually photographs of people unrelated to Surefire, including actor Christoph Waltz. News agencies found profiles of supposed Surefire Intelligence employees on the LinkedIn professional networking site which used photographs of unrelated celebrities as profile images; a photograph of Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli was used on a profile claiming to be the company's \\"Tel Aviv station chief\\", and a profile of a \\"Matthew Cohen\\" used an altered photo of Wohl. A journalist visited the address listed on Surefire Intelligence's website and found it to be the location of an unrelated company. Soon after creating the company, Wohl advertised it as a team of private investigators on classified ad site Craigslist. In the ad, Wohl falsely claimed that Surefire consisted of former Israeli intelligence agents and various other investigative experts. At least once, Wohl posed as investigator \\"Matthew Cohen\\" to a potential client who responded to the ad. One paid him a $1,200 advance fee for help in recovering her stolen truck, but Wohl never performed any investigative services for the fee, nor did he return the money or contact her again. Minutes after Michael Avenatti was reported being arrested on suspicion of domestic violence on November 14, 2018, the Surefire Twitter account tweeted a news story about the arrest, adding, \\"Surefire Intelligence strikes again.\\"  Kidnapping allegations  Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman address kidnapping allegations at a press conference on August 6, 2020 Merritt Corrigan, deputy White House liaison for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), was fired from her position on August 3, 2020 shortly after unlocking her previously private Twitter account and sending several anti-LGBT tweets. The same day, she announced she would be holding a press conference on August 6 with Wohl and Burkman to expose what she described as \\"rampant anti-Christian sentiment\\" at USAID. A press release from Wohl and Burkman claimed that Wohl had \\"been working behind the scenes with Corrigan for months.\\" On the afternoon of August 4, Corrigan deleted her tweets from the previous day. Wohl claimed that Corrigan was being convinced by associates of President Donald Trump to go back on her claims against the USAID, and Burkman said that Corrigan had \\"buyer's remorse\\" for sending the tweets. Later that day, Corrigan issued a statement apologizing for her tweets, and alleging: \\"I did NOT send these messages, and while I vehemently protested about them being sent in my name, my devices were not in my control. I see now that I was part of an abusive scheme and I was used to attack people that have nothing to do with me.\\" She said that she would not be participating in any press conferences, and claimed that \\"individuals ... forced me to hand over my devices so they could control me and the output in my name.\\" Wohl released his own statement saying that he was being falsely accused of kidnapping, and that he and Burkman would be holding the August 6 press conference. He also claimed that he and Corrigan had been involved in a romantic and sexual relationship. At the press conference, Wohl and Burkman denied the kidnapping allegations, saying that they had been fabricated by a long-time friend of Corrigan, far-right activist Raheem Kassam. Following the press conference, he published a 90-second recording of a conversation between him and Corrigan which he claimed exonerated him of wrongdoing, though according to journalist Ford Fischer, \\"the recording, however, shows Corrigan accusing Wohl of preventing her from having contact with her friends, and Wohl accusing Kassam of creating the situation. Corrigan doesn‚Äôt appear to say anything corroborating Wohl‚Äôs account of events.\\"  Voter suppression robocall  In August 2020, a robocall campaign attempted to suppress votes in battleground areas, including Detroit and Pennsylvania. The robocall campaign appeared to originate from Burkman's personal cell phone number, and the caller identified themselves as part of Wohl and Burkman's Project 1599. The message disseminated the false claims that information provided by those who use mail-in ballots will be used by police to find criminals, by credit card companies for debt collection purposes, and by the CDC to \\"track people for mandatory vaccines\\". Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a tweet that they were not sure who was responsible for the robocalls, but that her office would collaborate with the Michigan Attorney General's office to identify and prosecute its creator. In a press release, Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel condemned the campaign as \\"racist\\" and as \\"an unconscionable, indefensible, blatant attempt to lie to citizens about their right to vote.\\" Wohl told the Associated Press that he and Burkman believed \\"leftist pranksters\\" had spoofed Burkman's phone number to make the phone calls, and threatened to sue Benson for defamation. On October 1, 2020, Nessel filed four felony charges each against Wohl and Burkman, including conspiring to intimidate voters in violation of election law and using a computer to commit the crimes. Nessel's investigation into the robocalls found that Wohl and Burkman had attempted to suppress voters of color from voting in the 2020 presidential election via a robocall campaign that made 85,000 calls across the country, including 12,000 in Detroit. The week before the charges were filed, investigators searched Wohl's Los Angeles home. Wohl and Burkman turned themselves in to Detroit police on October 8, 2020, and appeared for court remotely from the Detroit Detention Center. Both pled not guilty, and their lawyers have argued that they were only exercising their rights to freedom of speech. They each face up to 24 years in state prison if convicted. An Ohio prosecutor is also considering possible additional charges against the pair for robocalls targeted at Ohioans, though no charges have yet been filed. Other activities From 2016, Wohl became a prominent online supporter of President Donald Trump. Trump posed for a photo op with Wohl and has retweeted him. In June 2018, Wohl's now-defunct news blog, \\"The Washington Reporter,\\" was found to have completely plagiarized its Code of Ethics from the journalism non-profit ProPublica. He was hired by the far-right outlet The Gateway Pundit in June 2018, before being fired later that year as a result of his failed plot against Mueller. NBC News reported in November 2018 that Wohl \\"has adopted and amplified nearly every prominent conspiracy theory to arise in the last year,\\" including unfounded claims against Hillary Clinton, George Soros, and the U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller. In October 2019, Wohl and Burkman announced they would investigate any rumors about candidates in the 2020 presidential election as a part of an effort they called \\"Project 1599.\\" Any candidates they fully vet, they said, would receive the \\"Burkman-Wohl Seal of Approval.\\" During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Wohl began selling a physical fitness program on his website. In April 2020, Wohl announced he had begun operating an account on OnlyFans, a subscription-based social media platform. The Washington Post reported that agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had executed a raid on Jack Burkman's home on the morning of September 14, 2020. Wohl claimed that the agents had taken \\"all of Jack's files, computers and phones\\" from the home, which is also the headquarters of Wohl and Burkman's organization, Project 1599. By the afternoon of the same day, The Washington Post had updated their story to reflect that the raid had been staged. The Daily Beast discovered that Wohl and Burkman had again recruited actors on Craigslist to stage the raid, under the guise of recording a television show. The Daily Beast also reported that the Twitter account which published the photos of the raid was likely operated by Wohl. Attempts to frame public figures Robert Mueller On October 22, 2018, Vermont Law School professor Jennifer Taub received an email from Wohl's firm, Surefire Intelligence, asking her to report on \\"past encounters with Robert Mueller\\" and offering her money to discuss Mueller by phone. Taub stated she had never met Mueller and referred the matter to Mueller's office, which then referred the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). On October 30, NBC News and The Atlantic published articles detailing a scheme to falsely accuse U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller of sexual misconduct in 1974. The articles reported that on October 17, 2018, several journalists received emails from a person claiming to be named \\"Lorraine Parsons\\" that asserted conservative lobbyist Jack Burkman had hired a man with Wohl's firm, Surefire Intelligence, to offer her more than $20,000 to sign an affidavit falsely accusing Mueller of sexual misconduct and workplace harassment. \\"Parsons\\" told the reporters she had worked with Mueller at the law firm Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro in 1974, and that the man from Surefire had asked her to falsely accuse Mueller of engaging in misconduct during that time. Mueller worked at Pillsbury in 1974, but the firm told reporters they had no record of any Lorraine Parsons ever working there. \\"Parsons\\" declined reporters' requests to speak on the phone, and none of the reporters published the story until the scheme became evident. On October 30, Wohl tweeted, \\"Several media sources tell me that a scandalous story about Mueller is breaking tomorrow. Should be interesting. Stay tuned!\\" The Gateway Pundit, which employed Wohl, published the \\"Lorraine Parsons\\" allegations on October 30, including \\"exclusive documents\\" about a \\"very credible witness\\" to support the accusations against Mueller. Each document had in its header the phrase \\"International Private Intelligence,\\" the business slogan of Wohl's firm, Surefire Intelligence. The article was removed later that day, with owner Jim Hoft stating that the matter and \\"serious allegations against Jacob Wohl\\" would be investigated. The following day, Hoft retweeted a tweet by Wohl that suggested Mueller's office was actually behind the scheme. Also that day, Burkman tweeted and Wohl retweeted that Parsons did not exist, denying involvement in the matter, and calling it \\"a hoax designed to distract the nation from [Burkman's] press conference\\" to be held the next day. Wohl and Burkman convened a press conference outside Washington on November 1, ostensibly to present a woman who they said signed an affidavit, which The Gateway Pundit had published, accusing Mueller of raping her in a New York hotel room in 2010on a date he was contemporaneously reported by The Washington Post to be serving jury duty in Washington. The men accused Mueller's office of \\"leaking\\" the eight-year- old Post story to discredit their allegations. The purported accuser, Carolyne Cass, did not appear at the press conference as they had initially stated she would, and the men asserted she had panicked in fear of her life and taken a flight to another location. Towards the end of the press conference, one reporter heckled, \\"Are you both prepared for federal prison?\\", to which Burkman replied \\"No we are not.\\" Soon after the press conference, Hoft announced that The Gateway Pundit had \\"suspended [their] relationship\\" with Wohl. On February 26, 2019, USA Today published an article about Wohl in which they interviewed Cass. She had initially contacted and offered $2,000 to Wohl, who was then posing as Cohen, on Craiglist in hopes that he would help recover some stolen money. Wohl did no work to recover the money, and instead offered Cass a position at his \\"intelligence\\" firm. Speaking of the document accusing Mueller produced by Wohl and his associates, she said that \\"They had made it up\\" with a fabricated signature of hers and that they \\"needed a credible female to put on the line\\". She said of Wohl: \\"He completely lied to me\\". In April 2019, the FBI declined a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for documents relating to Surefire Intelligence, explaining that \\"Acknowledging the existence or non-existence of records could reasonably be expected to interfere with law enforcement proceedings\\", citing FOIA exemption (b)(7)(A). Reporter Colin Kalmbacher commented on Law & Crime that this is a common excuse used by law enforcement agencies, which suggests that an active FBI criminal probe against Jacob Wohl is under way. Pete Buttigieg On April 22, 2019, Jack Burkman tweeted \\"2020 is shaping up to be more exciting than 2016. Looking like it will be Trump vs. Mayor Pete! Get the popcorn ready!\\" A Medium post emerged on April 28, published under the name of a gay Republican college student, alleging that Pete Buttigieg had sexually assaulted him in February. At the time, Buttigieg was the mayor of South Bend, Indiana and a Democratic presidential candidate for 2020. David Wohl, Jacob's father, shared an article on Twitter about the post published by far-right website Big League Politics. A Twitter account created just a month prior under the student's name also emerged. The next day, The Daily Beast reported that Wohl and Jack Burkman had tried to convince several young Republican men to make false accusations of sexual assault against Buttigieg. One man attested that Wohl and Burkman had tried to convince him to falsely accuse Buttigieg of assaulting him when he was too drunk to consent. According to the anonymous source, Wohl and Burkman contacted him under the false identities \\"Bill\\" and \\"Matt Teller\\", but when they met in person the man recognized Wohl due to Wohl's internet notoriety and decided to secretly record their conversation. He then provided the recording to The Daily Beast, which wrote that it corroborated the man's claims with the aid of an audio forensics analyst who determined that one man in the recording was \\"highly likely\\" to be Wohl. The source said that he did not agree at the time to participate in the scheme, and that Wohl phoned him shortly thereafter to suggest he recommend his friends who would fit the role of playing victim. The phone number allegedly used by Wohl was discovered to have been listed on the website of \\"Potomac Intelligence Group\\", supposedly a private intelligence firm working for Saudi Arabia, with Matt Teller listed as one of the employees and linking to a LinkedIn profile page. Minutes after Wohl was contacted by The Daily Beast, the website and the LinkedIn page were taken down, and the phone number was disconnected. In addition to \\"Potomac Intelligence\\", Wohl was later found to be linked to at least four other fake intelligence firms. The student who was being impersonated on Medium and Twitter told The Daily Beast that Wohl and Burkman flew him to Washington, D.C. under the guise of speaking about politics from the perspective of a gay Republican, and that he was unaware they were trying to involve him in their scheme. He said they had created the Medium profile and a Twitter profile claiming to be him without his permission. Wohl and Burkman announced that they would be holding a press conference at Burkman's house on May 8 to continue their accusations against Buttigieg. On May 7, Burkman tweeted a link to an event called \\"Protest Against Homophobic Bigots\\" and wrote, \\"Hundreds of leftist protestors are set to descend on our Wednesday Press conference. We WILL NOT surrender to the mob. We‚Äôve called in extra security to guard our safety and that of our partners in the media.\\" The protest was discovered to be fake, organized by Wohl himself, when attendees received confirmation emails containing the email address wohlthinktank@gmail.com, which Wohl had used in the past. Mediaite noted that events can be registered with false contact information on Eventbrite, but that Eventbrite would have emailed the address used by the organizer allowing them to delete or edit the event. However, Wohl denied involvement in creating the event page. Eventbrite later took down the event page citing their rules against \\"inauthentic content\\". At the May 8 press conference, Wohl and Burkman displayed footage of the student they had flown to Washington, D.C. drinking a coffee as proof that the student was not being coerced, with Wohl explaining that \\"Most forced coercion events‚Ä¶ do not involve caramel frappuccino.\\" While the press conference was underway, the student released his own statement describing Wohl and Burkman as \\"chronic liars\\" and stating that he would not be at the press conference as they had claimed. No protesters attended the fake protest of the press conference that Wohl himself had attempted to organize. Wohl and Burkman later threatened to sue The Daily Beast, who had broken the news that the claims were false, for $500 million. , no lawsuit had been filed.  Senator Kamala Harris  In October 2019, Wohl and Burkman held a press conference in which they alleged the California senator and then-2020 presidential candidate Kamala Harris had engaged in an extramarital affair. They were joined by a man who alleged that he had been Harris' personal trainer and that she had paid him thousands of dollars for sex. During the press conference, a man approached the Wohl and Burkman and handed them papers, which the two claimed were a cease and desist letter from Harris' campaign. They refused to allow journalists to see the document, first claiming they had disposed of it and later claiming they would release it after their lawyers reviewed it. The Daily Beast wrote that the cease and desist was \\"apparently fake\\". Wohl and Burkman also claimed they had text messages between the accuser and Harris, but declined to allow reporters to see them. Newsweek later wrote that they were unable to find any record that the accuser was a personal trainer, and also found discrepancies in the spelling of the accuser's name. It was later discovered that the accuser was an actor who had responded to a Craigslist ad requesting a male actor for \\"performance art\\". The man was unaware that Harris was a real person, and said that he was led to believe everyone at the press conference, including journalists and hecklers, were also paid actors. He said that Wohl had told him that he was a director, and that they were filming a show for Spike TV (a channel which, as of October 2019, had been shut down for a year). The man, whose real name was attached to the allegations, said that after the conference he started to receive accusations that he was a liar via social media, and that he became scared to go outside.  Anthony Fauci  In late April 2020, a press release was sent out in which a woman claimed to have been sexually assaulted in 2014 by Dr. Anthony Fauci, a prominent member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Only The Daily Dot reported on the allegation, to debunk it as a likely smear attempt. On May 2, 2020, the woman told Reason magazine that she and another woman had been paid by Wohl and Burkman to fabricate allegations against Fauci. She said that she knew Wohl from several years ago when they were romantically involved, and that he had encouraged her to frame Fauci using the details of a real sexual assault she had experienced, and that she had divulged to Wohl when they were dating. She claimed that Wohl had previously paid her to use the story of her assault to frame an Academy Award-winning actor, but the story gained no traction, and so he had her reuse it to attempt to frame Fauci. According to Reason, the woman taped a phone call with Wohl and Burkman when she decided to expose the scheme. In the recording, Wohl responds to the woman's concerns over the ramifications of the accusation by saying, \\"Look, can you just do this for me? Can you just keep your mouth shut and just...just do it for me.\\" The two men also ask her \\"[who cares if you] made up a story. Grow up, for Christ's sake\\" and claim that she \\"readily volunteered\\" to make the false accusation. The recording reportedly captures Wohl telling the woman: \\"You did a good job, you got paid. What's the problem? What seems to be the issue?\\" Other false and unfounded claims  \\"Hipster coffee shop\\"  After Wohl made a popular tweet that he had \\"just left a hipster coffee shop‚Äù where he overheard \\"libs\\" (liberals) praising President Donald Trump's interactions with Vladimir Putin at the 2018 Russia‚ÄìUnited States summit in Helsinki, other tweets by Wohl were uncovered that repeated the same phrase alongside claims that he had overheard groups of customers including liberals, Democrats, and Jewish people voicing support for Donald Trump or opposition to his political opponents. These repeated events in similar locations were viewed to be improbable, and the tweets were mocked in an online meme in which people followed the phrase \\"just left a hipster coffee shop\\" with unlikely fictional scenarios. Wohl later admitted that he had fabricated the conversations he claimed to have overheard. Kamala Harris citizenship On January 22, 2019, Wohl falsely claimed on Twitter that Democratic Senator and then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris was not an American citizen on account of her parents not being naturalized citizens at the time of her birth, and as such, was ineligible to be president. Harris was born in Oakland, California, and is therefore a U.S. citizen regardless of her parents' citizenship status at the time. Politifact rated Wohl's claim \\"Pants on Fire\\". In February 2019, Wohl used a fake Twitter account that claimed to represent a group women who supported Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz's possible 2020 presidential campaign to write that Kamala Harris \\"does not represent American Women\\" and that she \\"traded sexual favors for public office\\". Representative Ilhan Omar and Minneapolis In February 2019, Wohl traveled to Minnesota with far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer claiming to investigate rumors that Ilhan Omar, U.S. Representative for Minnesota's 5th congressional district and a Somali- American, had married her brother to grant him U.S. citizenship. Their trip was organized and followed by Ali Alexander, a Republican operative. Wohl set up an online fundraising campaign to try to raise $25,000 to fund the trip. In a subsequent series of tweets and live streams, Wohl claimed that Minneapolis had \\"no-go zones\\" infested by \\"Somali jihadists\\", that a local Somali man had threatened to kill him, that \\"Islamicist forces have taken over sections of [Minnesota's] police departments\\", and that he had to wear a bulletproof vest and travel with a team of \\"security professionals\\" in armored cars to avoid hitmen. The team of \\"security professionals\\", however, did not appear in any of their livestreams, and Wohl declined livestream watchers' requests to film the armored cars and security team he claimed to have hired. Star Tribune columnist Jennifer Brooks wrote that the group \\"cast lie after lie after lie into the wind\\" and that \\"for every minute they spent lying about conditions in Minnesota, they spent at least four begging for donations for their cause.\\" Pat Garofalo, a Republican state Representative for Minnesota, refuted Wohl's claim about \\"no-go zones\\" in a tweet, calling it \\"a lie\\" and \\"a farce\\". Wohl appeared on the grounds of the 2019 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) with Jack Burkman, ostensibly to present evidence from the \\"investigation\\", before being ejected from the conference grounds. Vox debunked Wohl's conspiracy theory as \\"largely nonsensical\\", citing that there is no evidence that Ahmed Elmi, Omar's ex-husband whom Wohl claimed to be her brother, was related to Omar in any way; that U.S. law permits a citizen to petition citizenship for their siblings, voiding the need for a marriage; and that Elmi, a British citizen, has never received US citizenship. Mother Jones wrote that Wohl's claims are \\"far into tinfoil-hat territory\\". In mid-March 2019, Wohl, Loomer, and Alexander released a documentary about their investigation into Omar in which they claimed that they have secured proof that she had married her brother. In the video, Wohl is shown filing a police report in a Minneapolis police station about death threats he claimed to have received while they were in the city. However, the Twitter account shown sending threats via direct message in the video was @DrakeHomes612, supposedly a \\"diversity coordinator\\" in Minneapolis, but actually one of the fake Twitter accounts Wohl had been operating himself. After news reports about Wohl's faked death threats came out, Alexander denied his involvement, said that he will investigate the issue, and condemned Wohl for lying in a clumsy way. The Daily Dot noted that Wohl might have filmed himself committing the crime of filing a false police report. On March 15, 2019, Aaron Delgado, a real estate agent from Minnesota, sued Wohl for stealing his Instagram photo and using it as the profile picture for Wohl's fake @DrakeHomes612 account. Delgado hired Michael Avenatti for the case, who announced that he will \\"pursue all available criminal and civil claims against Jacob Wohl. It is time that he face the consequences for his outrageous conduct. And I intend on ensuring that he does.\\"  Roger Stone jury  In late February 2020, Wohl and Burkman alleged that the jury that convicted Roger Stone, on seven felonies related to the Robert Mueller's Special Counsel investigation, was biased against him. In a press conference held on February 27, 2020, Wohl and Burkman distributed copies of confidential juror questionnaires, and they later published some of the questionnaires on Twitter. In September 2020, The Daily Beast reported that the FBI was investigating Wohl and Burkman for potentially attempting to influence the jurors or tamper with witnesses. The FBI is also investigating how the two obtained the questionnaires. Other false claims On February 6, 2019, Colin Campbell, an editor of The News & Observer, tweeted photos that showed two white students in Klan robes holding a noose around the neck of another white student wearing blackface. The photos are from the 1979 yearbook page for the Chi Phi fraternity of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Roy Cooper, the incumbent Governor of North Carolina, graduated that year with membership to a different fraternity, the Chi Psi. Later that day, The Daily Mail published a story with the misleading headline \\"Blackface lynch pics from Roy Cooper North Carolina yearbook\\", although it had clarified in the article that there is no evidence that Cooper was in any of the photos. The next day, Wohl tweeted \\"BREAKING: Racist picture of Democrat[ic] North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper emerges just days after he called on Ralph Northam to resign - Daily Mail\\", but did not include any link to Daily Mail articles. Wohl did not respond to an inquiry from Politifact. Politifact rated Wohl's tweet \\"Pants on Fire\\". On October 1, 2019, Wohl and Jack Burkman held a press conference on the front steps of Burkman's home in which they claimed to know the identity of the whistleblower who revealed possible impropriety by President Trump involving Ukraine, though they said they could not release the whistleblower's name. The press conference was sparsely attended and described by The Washington Post as another in a series of events in which Wohl and Burkman \\"routinely announce they have discovered smoking-gun revelations against Trump‚Äôs rivals, then humiliate themselves when they fail to produce any evidence\\". On October 3, 2019, Wohl and Burkman held another press conference, in which they claimed Senator and 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren had had a sexual relationship with a 24-year-old former U.S. Marine. At the event, the accuser presented by Wohl and Burkman kept laughing as he described the allegations. The accuser also showed a supposed \\"sex scar\\", which was debunked due to the accuser having previously posted on his social media account a picture of the same scar stating that he had \\"hit [his] back with a chain trying to take down a swing\\". The conference was met with mockery and disbelief in the media, and the claim was widely assumed to be another of Wohl and Burkman's false allegations. During the October 2019 press conference in which Wohl and Burkman falsely accused Buttigieg of sexual assault, the pair also shared an unsubstantiated rumor that Joe Biden might have Parkinson's disease. In March 2020, Wohl published fake COVID-19 test results, claiming that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had COVID-19 and would die in 30 days.  Bans from social media  Wohl was active on Twitter, which he used to spread lies and misleading information about Democratic politicians and post in support of President Trump. In the February 26, 2019 interview with USA Today, Wohl said that he planned to create fake left-wing accounts to try to direct votes towards Democrats who would make weaker opponents for Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Wohl also stated that he sought to solicit \\"damaging information\\" against left-leaning nonprofits such as the Southern Poverty Law Center, Media Matters for America, and Right Wing Watch, by providing insiders money or \\"moral reconciliation\\". On the same day as the USA Today article was published, Twitter permanently banned Wohl after an investigation found that he had already broken the site's rules against creating fake accounts. The accounts Wohl operated included @Women_4_Schultz, which purported to be a group of women supporting billionaire and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz's possible 2020 presidential campaign, as well as @JWohlTreason, @DrakeHomes612, and @Ericshanzner. When contacted by USA Today after the ban was placed, Wohl stated that he had created these accounts for his businesses and \\"future think tank\\", but maintained that he had \\"not created fake accounts or bot armies or anything like that\\". In a February 26 interview with NBC News, he said, \\"In my entire adult life, I‚Äôve had three Twitter accounts,\\" indicating his @JacobAWohl account, his intelligence company's Twitter account, and his think tank account. In the same interview, he first denied but later admitted to operating the @Women_4_Schultz account. Wohl said that the veracity of the information he spreads is not important, and that \\"All that matters is how far those claims travel, and how many people believe them.\\" He further said that truth is an obsolete concept, stating that \\"It‚Äôs something that can‚Äôt be thought about in a linear, binary true-false, facts- non-facts ‚Äì you can‚Äôt do that anymore [...] It‚Äôs just not the way it works.\\" He defended his attempt to manipulate elections, stating that \\"It is not illegal, unethical, or untoward for Americans to steer an American election.\\" Without providing any evidence, he claimed antisemitism was behind his Twitter suspension, and that it was retribution for his purported \\"investigation\\" of Representative Ilhan Omar. Wohl was banned from both Instagram and Facebook on August 31, 2020. According to the latter platform, the ban was to enforce their rules that disallow \\"coordinated inauthentic behavior\\", which they alleged Wohl had violated by creating fake accounts in advance of the November 2020 election. Writing on Telegram about the ban, Wohl said, \\"Now that I‚Äôve been banned by Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram, I no longer have any reservations about using their platforms to 'manipulate the conversation,' as they put it. Project 1599 will make Cambridge Analytica look like a middle school science fair project.\\" Family and personal life Wohl is Jewish, and describes himself as a Zionist. He has co-hosted a podcast for Jewish Trump supporters with Laura Loomer. His father, David Wohl, is an attorney and conservative commentator who has been a guest on Fox News programs and who has also promoted conspiracy theories. , Wohl lived in Los Angeles, California.

History The newspaper was established on the basis of the Highest Commandment on November 8, 1868, which was deemed necessary to concentrate in one common official newspaper for all ministries and main departments for printing various government orders, announcements and clarifications. The idea of creation belonged to the Minister of the Interior Alexander Timashev.Nikolay Lisovsky. Bibliography of the Russian periodical press of 1703‚Äì1900, 1915, p. 248. It was published in St. Petersburg from January 13, 1869 to March 11, 1917, except Mondays and other post-holiday days. The Government Gazette replaced the newspaper Severnaya Pochta. The newspaper published orders and reports from the government, reports on meetings of the Council of Ministers and the State Council, domestic and foreign news, articles and book reviews, stock indexes, weather reports and other materials.Government Gazette ‚Äì an article from the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. Since 1861, the weekly newspaper Selskiy Vestnik was published under the Government Gazette. In March 1917, the newspaper resumed its publication under the title \\"Provisional Government Gazette\\" (from March 5 to November 6, 1917) ‚Äì as the official body of the Provisional Government. In the ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù section, the newspaper published (in some issues) ‚Äúlists of secret officers‚Äù of the previous regime with a brief description of their activities and their remuneration. On October 28, 1917, the same editorial board (in the same building of the former Ministry of the Interior on Fontanka, 57) began to publish \\"The Newspaper of the Provisional Worker and Peasant Government\\" ‚Äì instead of the \\"Provisional Government Gazette\\",\\"The Newspaper of the Provisional Worker and Peasant Government\\". November 10, 1917, No. 1, p. 1 (notice from the editors). which retained the general format and design of the \\"Government Gazette\\" and called itself \\"the official body of the Council of People's Commissars\\".\\"The Newspaper of the Provisional Worker and Peasant Government\\". December 25, 1917, No. 30, p. 1 (announcement of subscription for 1918). Along with the former newspaper headings, a heading \\"Secret Documents\\" appeared, where some secret documents of the tsarist government of pre-revolutionary years were printed. From the beginning of January 1918, the newspaper switched to reformed spelling ‚Äì unlike other Soviet newspapers. From February 2, 1918 ‚Äì \\"The Newspaper of the Worker and Peasant Government\\". The newspaper was published until March 10, 1918, when the issue was discontinued.

The 2005 UNESCO Convention encourages its 146 parties to introduce policies for culture within a global context and commitment to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions. The second and most recent report (2018) subtitled ‚ÄúAdvancing Creativity for Development‚Äù follows the first report (2015) with the subtitle ‚ÄúA Decade Promoting the Diversity of Cultural Expressions for Development‚Äù. Primarily, the report series draws on reports of all parties to the Convention submitted every four years in which they present and describe the actions they have taken in order to implement the Convention. These reports are called quadrennial periodic reports (QPRs). In addition, the report series includes the analysis of other both governmental and non-governmental sources. In general, the report investigates how implementing the convention reshapes cultural policies. Additionally, it provides evidence of how the implementation process contributes to attaining the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for every human being. The report series also analyses trends and issues concerning the creative economy, which currently is worth $2,250 billion and employs 30 million people worldwide. The report puts forward a set of policy recommendations for the future, addressing the adaptation of cultural policies to rapid change in the digital environment, based on human rights and fundamental freedoms of expression. ‚ÄúEach Report is not an end-result, but a tool to be used in a long-term process that includes the forging of spaces for policy dialogue, reinforcing stakeholders‚Äô capacities to work together to generate data and information, and advocate for policy innovation both nationally and globally.‚Äù The reports are published in English, French, Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, Arabic, Chinese, Indonesian, Vietnamese and German. UNESCO is the lead institutional author of the Global Report series and coordinates a broader network of independent experts who author chapters. In line with the Parties‚Äô quadrennial periodic reporting, the series is produced every four years. The first cycle spanned the years 2012-2015 and the second runs from 2016 to 2019. Accordingly, the third publication will take place in December 2021. __TOC__  Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (2005)  The 2005 Convention is an international standard setting instrument providing a framework for the governance of culture. In this context, governance of culture refers to policies and measures governments establish to regulate, to promote and to protect all forms of creativity and artistic expressions. The most recent UNESCO Convention in the field of culture and ratified by 146 parties, it is the first international legal tool to encourage governments to invest in creativity. It frames the formulation and implementation of different types of legislative, regulatory, institutional and financial interventions to promote the emergence of dynamic cultural and creative industry sectors around the world. Within the context of the 2005 Convention, the diversity of cultural expressions ‚Ä≥refers to the manifold ways in which the cultures of groups and societies find expression. These expressions are passed on within and among groups and societies‚Ä≥. Specifically, the Convention understands cultural expressions as all forms of creativity and artistic expressions, such as in cinema/audiovisual arts, design, digital arts, music, performing arts, publishing and the visual arts. The 2005 Convention was \\"since its beginnings, permeated by a material and economic perspective of cultural expressions, focused on the production and consumption of cultural goods and services, with a view to promote more balanced exchanges and sustainable development that takes into account cultural diversity concerns.\\" The implementation of the 2005 Convention aims to contribute to achieving several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), precisely SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). The implementation process identifies investing in creativity as a priority for sustainable development. At the global level, the convention calls for countries to provide financial assistance for creativity through their Official Development Assistance (ODA) by investing in the Convention‚Äôs International Fund for Cultural Diversity. Additionally, UNESCO, through the 2005 Convention, offers technical assistance to strengthen human and institutional capacities in developing countries.  Content  The director general of UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay referring to the UNESCO General Conference's conviction that cultural activities, goods and services have both an economic and a cultural nature stated: > ‚Ä≥[c]ulture is not a commodity: it carries values and identities, it gives > markers to live together in a globalized world. Our role is to encourage, > question, collect data, to understand and energize creative channels, to > encourage the mobility of artists, to stimulate a rapidly changing sector in > the new digital environment‚Ä≥. Audrey Azoulay, Director General of UNESCO. > In Annika Markovic, Ambassador and Permanent Delegate of Sweden to UNESCO, in 2018, claimed that the report is ‚Äúthe only global document that presents an overview of cultural development world-wide and monitors state action to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions at all levels.‚Äù The following aspects thematically summarize the core findings identified by the 2018 report with regard to the implementation of the 2005 UNESCO Convention.  Culture & sustainable development  For the first time, national development plans and strategies integrate culture, mainly of countries in the Global South. As a result, cities seem to invest more and more in cultural industries for development. The UN‚Äôs 2030 Agenda recognized the role of creativity in sustainable development in the implementation of the SDGs. However, the share of development aid spent on culture today is the lowest it has been in over 10 years.  Cultural expressions in the digital age  According to the report, digital revenues make up 50% of the recorded music market, growing almost 18% over the past year due to a sharp increase in the share of streaming revenues. The report states that the internet transforms the cultural value chain into a network platform. E-commerce challenges both culture and trade policies that intend to promote the diversity of cultural expressions. It articulates the urgency to improve data collection on revenues generated through digital channels in order to design better policies and negotiate fair trade agreements. The report claims that monitoring the relationship between large platforms, Big Data, artificial intelligence and the diversity of cultural expressions is crucial to ensure that a variety of distribution platforms and providers promote and protect future artistic creations.  Artistic freedom  As informed by the report, attacks against artists have increased in the past years, including in the digital environment where surveillance and online trolling pose new threats to artistic freedom. In 2016, 430 cases were reported around the world (compared to 340 in 2015 and 90 in 2014). Musicians are the most threatened group, while authors also often become a target. In 2016, attacks against authors occurred most often in the Asia-Pacific Region (80 cases), the Middle East and North Africa (51 cases) and Europe (47 cases). The report reveals that meanwhile, there exists an increased awareness with regard to such threats leading to a larger number of initiatives to support the social and economic rights of artists, particularly in African countries. While there exists legal action to affirm the freedom of expression for artists, other laws addressing terrorism and state security repress artistic expressions.  Gender equality in cultural and creative industries  Proportion of female artists in ten recent global biennales, 2017 The report states that half of the persons working in the cultural and creative industries are female. However, a gender gap persists worldwide concerning equal pay, access to funding and prices charged for creative works. Consequently, women remain under-represented in key creative roles and are outnumbered in decision-making positions. Women make up only 34% of Ministers for Culture (compared to 24% in 2005) and only 31% of national arts program directors. Generally, women are represented in specific cultural fields such as arts education and training (60%), book publishing and press (54%), audiovisual and interactive media (26%), as well as design and creative services (33%).  Mobility of artists and cultural professionals  Average number of countries accessible without visas passport-holders Global North and Global South, 2017 The report demonstrates that predominantly restrictions in terms of mobility represent great challenges to persons pursuing careers in the cultural and creative industries, specifically to those from the Global South. It reveals that a holder of a German passport can travel to 176 countries without a visa while a holder of an Afghan passport can only travel to 24 countries without a visa. As a matter of fact, artists and cultural professionals need to travel to perform, to reach new audiences or to attend a residency or to engage in networking. The report exposes that travel restrictions, including difficulties in obtaining visas oftentimes impedes artists from the Global South to participate in art biennales or film festivals, even when invited to receive an award or to promote their works.  Governance of culture  As stated in the report, the 2005 Convention provides legitimacy for the formulation of cultural policies and their adaptation to changing circumstances and needs. The report underscores that collaborative governance and multi-stakeholder policy making have progressed, notably in some developing countries particularly in the creative economy and cultural education. As a result, parties to the Convention have made considerable progress in fostering digital arts creation, supporting creative entrepreneurship, accelerating the modernization of cultural sectors, promoting distribution and updating copyright legislation. However, the report also reveals a lack in civil society participation in policy making. It underlines the urgency for more effort to ensure the creation of open, transparent and participatory policy processes in order to involve civil society participation in policy making.  Trade and investment in cultural goods and services  In accordance with the report, the 2005 Convention formally recognizes that cultural goods and services not only have important economic value, but also convey identities, meanings and values. As a consequence, at least eight bilateral and regional free trade agreements concluded between 2015 and 2017 have introduced cultural clauses or list of commitments that promote the objectives and principles of the 2005 Convention. Despite the lack of the promotion of the objectives and principles of the 2005 Convention with regard to the negotiation of mega-regional partnership agreements, some Parties to the Trans Pacific Partnership (TTP) have succeeded in introducing important cultural reservations to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions.  Next steps  The report‚Äôs primary objective is ‚Äúto provide key actors with better knowledge on how to support evidence-based policy, and to strengthen informed, transparent and participatory systems of governance for culture.‚Äù It aims to motivate governments and civil society actors to integrate findings and recommendations into their national cultural policy and development strategies and frameworks. Following the findings presented above, the implementation of the 2005 Convention \\"introduce[s] a range of different policy strategies for integrating culture into development processes\\" and culture is increasingly regarded as \\"an economic asset in pursuing sustainable development\\". Based on its analysis and findings, the Global Report of 2018 suggests the following road map for the parties to the 2005 Convention. Accordingly, parties could tackle major challenges in the implementation of the 2005 Convention by: # Streamlining and harmonizing data and information required for national and global monitoring purposes; # Encouraging research networks and statistical offices around the world to use the Global Report monitoring framework, its core indicators and means of verification as a basis for their data collection and the establishing of statistical baselines; # Filling existing data gaps identified in the two Global reports referring to key cultural policy areas, such as trade in cultural services, mobility flows, culture in the digital environment, or gender-disaggregated data; # Raising awareness among policy decision makers for cultural policy reforms; # Building capacities on policy monitoring; # Sensitizing the development community with regard to the creative sector's potential not only contributes to the creation of jobs and income, but also catalyzes innovation, permeating traditional development areas such as education and gender equality, and brings about change.  Challenges  Speaking about the visibility of the progress in cultural policies shown by the report series, B√°rbara Lovriniƒá stated that ‚Äú[u]nfortunately, where UNESCO is concerned, there is a lack of promotion in the media in general. In the long term, the report could have a positive impact on these issues, which would be enhanced if the public were made more aware of such work.‚Äù She also points out that there is \\"a risk that many people will not dwell on the 2005 Convention and the Sustainable Development Goals unless they are already somewhat familiar with the topic.‚Äù With reference to the title of the report series, she concludes that \\"cultural policy-making is still far from being reshaped, for it takes a serious amount of time to yield valuable results.‚Äù  See also  *UNESCO *UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals *UNESCO Institute for Statistics *Creativity *Creative Industries *Artistic Freedom  External links  *Global Report 2015 *Global Report 2018 *2005 Convention Brochure: Investing in Creativity *UNESCO website section for the Diversity of Cultural Expressions *Sustainable Development Goals  References  Category:Publications Category:Culture Category:UNESCO Category:Multilateral relations Category:Policy Category:The arts Category:Sustainable development ","title":"Reshaping Cultural Policies"},{"id":"58929077","text":"Lourett Russell Grant () is a singer, model, and dancer. She co-wrote and performed the disco hit Hot to Trot and was a fixture in the dance music scene throughout the 1980s. Career Grant's career as a singer solidified once she met Silvio Tancredi in New York City in 1978. The son of the consular agent at the Italian consulate in New York City, Tancredi was a musician- turned-record producer who had been contracted to Atlantic Records by Ahmet Ertegun, the company's co-founder. Tancredi had produced Yellow Fever by Herbie Mann and Stairway to Love by the disco group Wonder Band. Tancredi championed Grant's music career, wanting to make her the \\"Dance Music Star for the 80s.\\" Together, they wrote and produced Grant's hit electro-rock-disco twelve-inch single, Hot to Trot, co-written by Jeffrey (Jeff) Schoen. Grant resided for several years at the exclusive, all female Barbizon Hotel in New York while Tancredi judiciously advanced her stardom. Grant and Tancredi co- founded Northcott Productions Ltd. and the custom record label Alverez Records Ltd. to produce, manufacture, and distribute the recording. Later, the recording would be picked up by WEA International and Quality Records for international distribution. Grant's vocal performance was described as \\"impassioned,\\" \\"hot,\\" and \\"emotionally plaintive.\\" The vocals were accompanied by \\"Italo bleeps and spare rhodes chords,\\" driven by a digital Synclavier rhythm along with a pulsating bass guitar riff and an overlay of hard-hitting percussion that builds into a powerful crescendo. The mix on the A-side enhanced the dance club experience, featuring the sound of gallops that panned across the dance floor. The mix on the B-side was distinctly different; it omitted the gallops and was intensified on the high and low ends to make for more memorable radio play. To underscore the image, Grant dressed in black leather jeans, a cowboy hat, and gun holsters when she performed to promote the recording. The recording was played in heavy rotation on the radio and in diverse dance clubs throughout the United States; John \\"Jellybean\\" Benitez, disc jockey at Xenon and other New York City clubs (and remixer of artists like Madonna), was an early supporter. The record debuted at number 70 on Billboard's Top 100 Disco chart, placing higher than On the Radio by Donna Summer and Rock with You / Don't Stop Til You Get Enough by Michael Jackson. The record remained on the chart for fifteen weeks. Major labels Quality Records and WEA International capitalized on the recording's domestic success by picking up the recording for distribution in the Canadian and European markets, respectively. In 2010, the recording was released on the second album of Horse Meat Disco, a London collective of four disc jockeys who curate disco compilations to continue to bring the genre to public attention. The recording is a collectors' item. After the success of her recording, Grant gained access to elite Italian social circles, aided by Tancredi's social connections; she was photographed by Vogue photographer Marco Glaviano. Grant also modeled for photographer Michael Keller and modeled in rock videos such as Rick Derringer's Shake Me, which was produced by Jake Hooker (who was married to Lorna Luft at the time). Grant remained a fixture in the dance club scene. Grant and Tancredi's Northcott company ran a handful of dance labels, managing its own publishing, production, manufacturing, and distribution. Club disc jockey Tommy Musto joined as head of production and A&R;‚Äì\\"Artists and Repertoire,\\" responsible for talent scouting and artist development‚Äìand ushered the company into becoming an essential outlet for New York City garage house dance music. After her time with Tancredi, Grant continued working in the music business. She sang with the Long Island-based rock band Loose Endz, which also featured a female bass player and a female drummer; the group performed at such venues as The Limelight in New York City. In 1990, Grant was signed by Warren Schatz, former senior executive with RCA and BMG's Ariola America. While signed with Schatz's Perfect Sound Studios, Inc., Grant wrote I Know (What You Need). As tastes in New York City's music scene drifted towards the rap and hip-hip genres, Grant shifted her focus. She earned a scholarship from the Goethe Institute in New York to study German in Germany in exchange for developing a promotional song for the Institute. Grant later recorded the classic Ich bin von Kopf bis fuss and wrote and recorded an original German pop song, Lass mich oder lieb mich baby. Later, she followed through on early training in dance and became a professional dancer. Personal life Grant married a German Estonian. The wedding took place in Spyker Castle in Vorpommern-R√ºgen; the couple settled in Germany but later divorced. Grant is a member of the Guild of One-Name Studies, a registered charity in the United Kingdom. Grant researches and disseminates information about her family's surname Philippides' ancestral connections to the ancient statesman Philippides of Paiania. She is also an academic historical writer whose articles have been published.

The project, created on the occasion of the 100th Anniversary of the end of World War I, was initiated by landscape architect Marek Sobola from ≈Ωilina, Slovakia. The main goal of the project is to promote a message of peace by planting a Tree of Peace on every continent. It is aimed at planting trees around the globe to draw awareness to the global environmental issue and to enhance the solidarity of the humankind.  Background  World War I had an impact on Sobola's family. His great-grandfather Ondrej Sobola (Andreas Szobola) died on the Russian battlefield. Ondrej was born on August 7, 1880, in the village of Lalinok near ≈Ωilina (then Lalinek, Kingdom of Hungary). He was enlisted in the 15th Military Infantry Regiment and went missing in 1915. Ondrej died in an unknown place. He was officially pronounced dead in 1930, with an official date of death: December 31, 1918. The story of the author's family inspired him to memorialize the soldiers who died in WWI in unknown places without their names or identities. This international project Tree of Peace officially represents the Slovak Republic under the brand called ‚ÄúGOOD IDEA SLOVAKIA ‚Äì IDEAS FROM SLOVAKIA‚Äù. The Trademark License is granted by the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of the Slovak Republic.  Future  Project has the ambition to be a universal message of joining the nations. Nowadays this project is not strictly linked to 1918 and the WWI, but rather generally to the need for peace and avoidance of global military conflicts. In this way, the project is universal and its application is made available to countries which were touched by WWI only marginally. But the author does not exclude the allusion to this global military conflict because thanks to it the project itself began. This project is European, international and strictly apolitical. The main idea of the project is a Message of Peace.  Motto  \\"Let¬¥s make love the lifeblood of this world\\" (Slovak: \\"Urobme l√°skavos≈• miazgou tohto sveta\\").

The ship is best remembered for allegedly crossing the intersection of the International Date Line and the Equator precisely at the turn of the year from 1899 to 1900. It sank in 1918,12 miles SW of La Gallite, in a collision with the French destroyer Catapulte and a resultant explosion of depth charges, while carrying troops between Bizerta and Marseille. History It was originally built for James Huddart for Trans-Tasman traffic between Australia and New Zealand, along with a sister ship , and later joined by . However, it was quickly withdrawn from this route and instead used to provide a service between Canada and Australia using subsidies from both countries. Huddart ran into difficulties after arranging to also call at New Zealand as part of the deal; after he defaulted on payments, the ship was purchased on 16 August 1899 by the New Zealand Shipping Company. In 1901 it was sold on to the Union Steamship company. In 1914, it was given the role of a troop ship, delivering the first Maori Pioneer military troops to Gallipoli in 1915. It was sold to Tan Kah Kee to become part of the Khiam Yik company in 1916. On 17 May 1918, as part of a convoy from Bizerta to Marseille, it collided with the French warship Catapulte. During the collision the warship's depth charges became dislodged and detonated in the water, causing ruptures to the Warrimoo and Catapulte. Both ships were lost, along with several lives. International Date Line story The ship is most commonly associated with the story of its alleged arrival at the crossing of the International Date Line and the Equator on 31 December 1899 at midnight, under the captaincy of Captain John Phillips. This resulted in the bow of the ship being in the southern hemisphere in the summer on 1 January 1900, with the stern being in the northern hemisphere in winter on 31 December 1899. The ship was therefore at once within two different seasons, in two different hemispheres, on two different days, in two different months, in two different years, in two different centuries. The story circulated as early as 1942, and was popularized by John Euller in the magazine Ships and the Sea in 1953. A commonly circulated version is as follows: > The passenger steamer SS Warrimoo was quietly knifing its way through the > waters of the mid-Pacific on its way from Vancouver to Australia. The > navigator had just finished working out a star fix and brought the master, > Captain John Phillips, the result. The Warrimoo's position was latitude 0 > degrees x 31 minutes north and longitude 179 degrees x 30 minutes west. The > date was 31 December 1899. Know what this means? First Mate Payton broke in, > we're only a few miles from the intersection of the Equator and the > International Date Line. Captain Phillips was prankish enough to take full > advantage of the opportunity for achieving the navigational freak of a > lifetime. He called his navigators to the bridge to check and double check > the ships position. He changed course slightly so as to bear directly on his > mark. Then he adjusted the engine speed. The calm weather and clear night > worked in his favour. At midnight the Warrimoo lay on the Equator at exactly > the point where it crossed the International Date Line! The consequences of > this bizarre position were many. The forward part of the ship was in the > Southern Hemisphere and the middle of summer.

She includes in her repertoire dances devoted to communicating facets of Egyptian culture. Taj's honorable title, \\"Dancing Queen,\\" derives from newspaper headlines. Early life Taj is descended from a long line of opulent Greek Athenians and Egyptiotes (Greek: ŒëŒπŒ≥œÖœÄœÑŒπœéœÑŒµœÇ). Her mother was a beauty queen who won the national pageant sponsored by the Greek-American Progressive Association (GAPA) and later became a singer and a Screen Actors Guild actress Training Taj was introduced to Middle Eastern dance in childhood. Later, as she developed her professional career, Taj trained in belly dance in the United States and Germany, where she studied with Dr. Mo Geddawi (a founding member of the Reda Troup), who praised her work. Career Hyatt Regency Resort, Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.Taj has been contracted annually as an in-house solo Egyptian belly dancer at upscale hotel venues throughout the Middle East, including Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt, where cultural and legal norms have been selective regarding who is eligible to perform. In Egypt, Taj was contracted as a principal belly dancer at the Hyatt Regency in Sharm El Sheikh and the Sheraton Towers and Casino in Cairo. Taj's audiences have included dignitaries such as politicians (including Egyptian Ambassador Youssef Zada) and Middle Eastern royalty. Outside of the Middle East, she has been selected to perform at events sponsored by the United Nations and by the Egyptian Tourism Authority. In 2009, Taj performed in New York City in an educational cultural program sponsored by the World Heritage Cultural Center. Taj also performed at the wedding celebration, termed the \\"Wedding of the Decade\\", of Middle-Eastern author and publisher Yara Michaels and ophthalmologist David W. Shoemaker; the event took place at C√† d‚ÄôZan at the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art.Gold Hall Theater, New York. Taj focuses on belly dance as being an artistic medium through which to communicate features of Egyptian culture. Taj rejects the floorwork that is common in other approaches (such as the Turkish style), believing the upright posture of the classical Egyptian genre to be more culturally representative. Her interpretation of musical accompaniment is influenced by the vocal style of the late Egyptian singer and actress Umm Kulthum. Taj performs through The Egyptian Cultural Performing Arts Society Inc., whose mission is to educate the public about Egyptian culture. The cornerstone of Taj's repertoire for the Society is Journey Down the Nile, a multi-media Egyptian cultural program during which she performs numerous regional dances of Egypt interspersed with film clips that explain them. The signature dance in the program is Wings of Isis, in which Taj portrays Cleopatra VII and illustrates the queen's identification with the goddess Isis. In addition, Taj produced, wrote, and performed in the educational short film, Ancient and Modern Dances of Egypt. Taj has written about her experiences dancing professionally in Berlin, Germany and Stockholm, Sweden and her pioneering performances in the first Stockholm belly dance festival known as The Nile Group. She has been a repeated contributor to Bennu, the publication of the Associated Artists of Middle Eastern Dance (ASAmed). Her 2015 essay, The Difference Between Art and Entertainment, is a component of the dance curriculum at Brigham Young University. Before developing her career in professional dance, Taj was a recording artist with a single that hit the Billboard charts.

Despite the law prohibiting women to practise law, on 14 November 1913 she received authorization from the President of the Supreme Court of Justice to do so and became the first female lawyer in Portugal. Early life Regina da Gl√≥ria Pinto de Magalh√£es Quintanilha de Sousa e Vasconcelos was born on 9 May 1893 in Bragan√ßa. Coming from a wealthy family, Quintanilha received a privileged education. Her mother, Josefa Quintanilha, was a writer and poet, who attached considerable value to study. After school in Bragan√ßa and completing high school in Porto, Quintanilha joined the Faculty of Law of the University of Coimbra, in 1910. At this time in Portugal it was extremely rare for a woman to go to university and she was the first woman to study Law in Portugal. The University of Coimbra was generally regarded as the best university in Portugal at that time, attracting students with the best high school marks. Among Quintanilha's fellow students was Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar, future head of state as leader of Portugal's Estado Novo dictatorship. Career In 1913 Quintanilha was granted authorization to practice Law, five years before a Decree was issued permitting women to do this. In the same year she made her debut in court in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon as the country's first female lawyer. This was favourably covered by several newspapers, such as Di√°rio de Not√≠cias, O S√©culo and '. She also worked as a public notary and as a conservator (record keeper) of the Portuguese Land Registry. She was also the first woman to have these responsibilities. In 1917, she served as president of the General Assembly of the feminist-inspired Portuguese Women's Crusade, an organization set up to provide support to conscripts during World War I. Quintanilha married Vicente de Vasconcelos, a judge, and they had two sons. She later moved to Brazil, where she collaborated in the reform of Brazilian law. She established an office in Rio de Janeiro and, later, one in New York. On her return to Portugal she worked as a lawyer for several French companies. Quintanilha died in Lisbon, on the 25 March 1967.

Born in Manchester, Kansas, he was raised on a farm in Dickinson County in a small family of Scottish ancestry. Fluent in Scottish Gaelic, French and German, as a young boy he developed a keen and enduring interest in grasshoppers that proliferated in his father's fields; seven species of which formed the basis of his 1916 paper in which he described what is known as a Robertsonian translocation (ROB). Graduating Abilene High School he attended the University of Kansas (A.B., 1906; A.M., 1907), one of Clarence Erwin McClung's eager students of cytology. An Austin Teaching Fellow of Zoology at Harvard University (Ph.D., 1915), he obtained his doctorate in the laboratory of Edward Laurens Mark. Dr. Robertson was a research scientist of the golden era of classical genetics, a period when the tools were breeding experiments and microscopes. Returning to the University of Kansas as Professor in the Department of Zoology, then moving to the University of Missouri; during the period of 1917-27 Dr. Robertson devoted himself to the extensive breeding of 4,800 turkeys and derived a valuable set of exquisite data, including many skin and feather samples. Moving to Iowa in 1930, while Dr. Robertson never published on the turkey materials and data, he left them in such order that they were subsequently published in 1943 by his doctoral students. Held in great esteem by the students he inspired with measured and painstaking research practices, he was deceased before the preparation of their manuscript, while Professor in the Anatomy Department of the Medical School of the University of Iowa. Valuable contributions to the understanding of inheritance in these birds were proven in his data. The final years of his life in Iowa were devoted to teaching, graduate students and further cytogenetics research dealing with the chromosomal relations in pigmy locusts and some larger grasshoppers. He also contributed a chapter on human heredity, \\"The Biological and Eugenical Background of The Family\\" to Jung's \\"Modern Marriage.\\" Dr. Robertson is buried alongside his parents at the Keystone Cemetery in Dickinson County, Kansas; his scientific legacy born of childhood curiosity on its plains.

Construction The order for the Arctic Offshore Patrol Ships was placed on 19 October 2011 with Irving Shipyards of Halifax, Nova Scotia as part of the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy. The ship was to be constructed in 62 blocks, which would then be pieced together into three larger blocks. These three \\"mega blocks\\" would be fitted together to form the hull of the ship. On 18 September 2014, it was announced that the first ship of the class was to be named Harry DeWolf in honour of Rear Admiral Harry DeWolf, a decorated naval officer who served during World War II in European waters and as the Royal Canadian Navy Chief of the Naval Staff during the early Cold War. The ship was given the hull number AOPV 430. On 18 June 2015 it was reported that the construction of test modules for Harry DeWolf was underway. The first sections of keel were placed on 11 March 2016, but the official laying of the keel of Harry DeWolf was held on 9 June 2016, marking the first naval construction in Canada since 1998. On 8 December 2017, the three main sections of Harry DeWolf were fitted into place. Harry DeWolf was launched on 15 September 2018. The vessel was loaded onto the semi-submersible barge Boa Barge 37 and taken out into Halifax Harbour. There, the barge was submerged and the ship floated free, to be towed back to the shipyard.

Legend of Venkateswara  The story goes that Ramanuja once asked Anantalwar to raise a flower garden for the Lord on the Tirumala hill, that is Venkateswara. Anantalwar abided by the request and went upon raising a garden. He took the help of his pregnant wife who found it difficult to do the manual labor from time to time. Lord Venkateswara having seen the trouble of the lady assumed the form of a young lad and helped her out. On one occasion when this came to the notice of Anantalwar, the latter was furious and he hit the lad with a crowbar. The lad then disappeared but when Anantalwar visited the god in Tirumala, he found that the Lord was bleeding from the chin. He at once realised that it was the Lord who had helped his wife and regretted his behavior. He applied raw camphor for the wound. Lord Venkateswara was impressed with Anantalwar's devotion and not only forgave him but also told him that he would display the raw camphor forever as a mark of Anantalwar's devotion.

Racing career 2008: two-year-old season Cavalryman was ridden in both of his races as a two-year-old by Maxime Guyon. After finishing fourth on his debut on 7 September at Longchamp Racecourse he recorded his first success in a minor event over 1600 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 10 October, coming home two lengths clear of his eight opponents at odds of 3.1/1. 2009: three-year-old season On his three-year-old debut Cavalryman ran fourth behind Allybar in the Prix Fran√ßois Mathet over 2000 metres at Saint- Cloud on 29 March but then produced a much better performance over the same course and distance on 12 May when he was beaten half a length by his stablemate Cutlass Bay in the Group 2 Prix Greffulhe. The Listed Prix Matchem again over 2000 metres at Saint-Cloud on 1 June saw Cavalryman start odds-on favourite against six opponents. He led from the start and won \\"very easily\\" by six lengths from Cirrus des Aigles. In the Group 1 Grand Prix de Paris over 2400 metres at Longchamp on 14 July the colt started second favourite behind the Aga Khan's Beheshtam in an eight-runner field which also included Mastery and a four horse entry from the Aidan O'Brien stable. Cavalryman produced a strong run on the outside in the straight, took the lead 200 metres out and won by one and a half lengths from Age of Aquarius. Fabre commented \\"I was quite confident coming into the race as he is a progressive horse by Halling and he has won nicely. He is effective from a mile and a quarter on heavy ground to a mile and a half\\". After a break of almost two months, Cavalryman returned for the Prix Niel, a race which often serves as a major trial for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, at Longchamp on 13 September. Racing for the first time in the blue silks of Godolphin he was partnered by Frankie Dettori with Guyon taking the ride on the stable's second string Claremont (Prix du Lys). Starting the 4/7 favourite he prevailed in a tight finish, taking the lead in the closing stages and winning by half a length from Beheshtam, with Aizavoski and Claremont close behind. After the race Dettori said \\"The pace wasn't very strong and he was too relaxed early. He was half-asleep. The race turned into a two-furlong sprint, but he picked up well when I asked him\\". In the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on 4 October Cavalryman started the 12/1 fourth choice in the betting in a nineteen-runner field. With Dettori in the saddle he stayed on well in the straight and finished third, two lengths and a head behind Sea the Stars and Youmzain. In the 2009 World Thoroughbred Rankings Cavalryman was given a rating of 125, making him the seventh-best racehorse in the world. 2010 & 2011: four- & five-year-old season At the end of the 2009 season Cavalryman was transferred to the stable of Saeed bin Suroor, whose trainees typically spend the summer in England and the winter in Dubai. He began 2010 with two runs at Meydan Racecourse but made little impact, coming home seventh in the Al Maktoum Challenge, Round 3 and fifth in the Dubai Sheema Classic. After returning to Europe he ran six times, all at Group 1 level, but failed to win a race. He finished fifth in the Coronation Cup, last in the Prince of Wales's Stakes, fourth in the International Stakes, third in the Grosser Preis von Baden, eighth in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and third in the Gran Premio del Jockey Club. He was ridden in all of his races by Dettori. Cavalryman's rating of 117 placed him 127th in the 2010 World Thoroughbred Rankings. Cavalryman ran five times in 2011 and for the second straight year he failed to win a race. He finished fourth in the Gordon Richards Stakes and then dropped back to Listed class and ran second to Jukebox Jury in the Fred Archer Stakes. After finishing last in both the Grosser Preis von Berlin and the Rheinland-Pokal he was stepped up in distance for the Prix Royal-Oak and ran fifth. 2012: six-year-old season Cavalryman began his fifth season at Meydan where he ran second in the Dubai City of Gold and seventh in the Sheema Classic. On his first start of the year in Europe the horse started the 9/4 second favourite for the Listed Grand Cup over fourteen furlongs at York Racecourse on 26 May. Ridden by Dettori he took the lead approaching the final furlong and recorded his first win in more than two and a half years as he came home two lengths clear of Calico Cat. Six weeks later he was stepped up to two miles for the Coral Marathon at Sandown Park and won in \\"very decisive\\" fashion, coming home four and a half lengths in front of the Cesarewitch winner Aaim To Prosper [sic]. After finishing fourth in the Lonsdale Cup at York and second in the Rose Bowl Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse he was sent to Australia to contest the Melbourne Cup on 6 November. Starting at odds of 30/1 he finished twelfth, beaten seven and a half lengths by the winner Green Moon. 2013: seven-year-old season Cavalryman was back in Dubai for his first two starts of 2013 and was ridden on both occasions by Silvestre de Sousa. In the Dubai City of Gold on 9 March he led for most of the way but was overtaken in the last 100 metres and finished third, beaten half a length and a short head behind Jakkalberry and Await the Dawn. Three weeks later, over two miles at Meydan, Cavalryman started at odds of 11/2 for the second running of the Dubai Gold Cup. The 2012 Grand Prix de Paris winner Imperial Monarch was made favourite while the other eight runners included Saddler's Rock (Goodwood Cup), Tenenbaum (Prix de Reux), Verema (Prix de Lut√®ce) and Ahzeemah (Nad Al Sheba Trophy). Cavalryman started slowly but took the lead 300 metres out and won \\"comfortably\\" by three lengths from Ahzeemah. Cavalryman was less successful on his return to Europe. He finished fifth in the Henry II Stakes, third in the Princess of Wales's Stakes and sixth behind Brown Panther in the Goodwood Cup on 1 August. He did not race again that year. 2014: eight- year-old season For the fifth time, Cavalryman began his campaign in Dubai, making his first appearance in the Group 3 Nad Al Sheba Trophy over 2800 metres at Meydan for which he tarted 3/1 joint-favourite with the Queen Alexandra Stakes winner Simenon. Ridden by De Sousa he went to the front 300 metres from the finish and drew away to win \\"comfortably\\" by five and a half lengths from the South African gelding Star Empire. The horse started 7/4 favourite when he attempted to repeat his 2013 success in the Dubai Gold Cup on 29 March but despite staying on strongly in the straight he failed by a neck to overhaul the 33/1 Irish outsider Certerach. Cavalryman was back in Europe for the Princess of Wales's Stakes over one and a half miles at Newmarket on 10 July and was made the 9/1 fourth choice in a six-runner field. Arab Spring the winner of the Duke of Edinburgh Stakes at Royal Ascot started favourite ahead of Hillstar (King Edward VII Stakes) and Pether's Moon. Cavalryman led from the start and set a slow pace before accelerating two furlongs out and got the better of a \\"sustained duel\\" with Hillstar to win by a neck with Pether's Moon half a length back in third place. De Sousa commented \\"He's very tough and genuine. He has been unlucky, but he's come back. I‚Äôm just delighted for him to come here and get his head in front\\". Three weeks later Cavalryman was moved back up in trip for the Goodwood Cup over two miles in which he was ridden by Kieren Fallon and started the 5/1 third favourite behind Estimate and Brown Panther. The other five runners included Forgotten Voice (Royal Hunt Cup), Angel Gabrial (Northumberland Plate) and Ahzeemah. After racing towards the rear of the closely grouped field, Cavalryman took the lead two furlongs out and despite hanging right in the final furlong he held on to win by a neck from Ahzeemah with the pair finishing more than four lengths clear of Brown Panther in third. After the race Fallon said \\"He's a real tough horse. He was campaigned during the Carnival in Dubai all winter and he has just come here and won a Goodwood Cup, which is a difficult race to win. It's one thing sprinters keeping their form from Dubai but it's hard to do it with distance horses\\". On his final run of the season Cavalryman ran fourth behind the Irish mare Pale Mimosa in the Lonsdale Cup at York on 22 August. Cavalryman's rating of 115 placed him 202nd in the 2014 World's Best Racehorse Rankings. 2015: nine-year-old season Cavalryman made his debut in the Nad Al Sheba Trophy at Meydan on 28 February in which he was ridden by William Buick and started the 11/10 favourite. After racing for seven furlongs he was pulled up after sustaining a serious fracture to his right hind leg. He was immediately transported to the local equine hospital but the injury proved to be untreatable and he was euthanised. Saeed bin Suroor said \\"He was a real character in the yard and was treasured, not only by me, but by everyone here‚Äîall of the team. We are very upset by the tragic news. He had a wonderful career and he will be hugely missed\\".

At age fifteen, Kotschick moved from Transylvania to Germany. He first studied at Heidelberg University and then at the University of Bonn. He received his doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1989 under the supervision of Simon Donaldson with thesis On the geometry of certain 4-manifolds and held postdoctoral positions at Princeton University and the University of Cambridge. He became a professor at the University of Basel in 1991 and a professor at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 1998. Kotschick has been a member of the Institute for Advanced Study three times (1989/90, 2008/09 and 2012/13).Kotschick, Dieter in the A community of scholars list of the IAS In 2012 he was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society. In 2009, he solved a 55-year-old open problem posed in 1954 by Friedrich Hirzebruch, which asks \\"which linear combinations of Chern numbers of smooth complex projective varieties are topologically invariant\\". He found that only linear combinations of the Euler characteristic and the Pontryagin numbers are invariants of orientation- preserving diffeomorphisms (and thus according to Sergei Novikov also of oriented homeomorphisms) of these varieties. Kotschick proved that if the condition of orientability is removed, only multiples of the Euler characteristic can be considered among the Chern numbers and their linear combinations as invariants of diffeomorphisms in three and more complex dimensions. For homeomorphisms he showed that the restriction on the dimension can be omitted. In addition, Kotschick proved further theorems about the structure of the set of Chern numbers of smooth complex-projective manifolds. He classified the possible patterns on the surface of an Adidas Telstar soccer ball, i.e. specialThe sides of the pentagons may only encounter hexagons; the hexagons must alternately bifurcate with pentagons and hexagons. tilings with pentagons and hexagons on the sphere.Kolumne Mathematische Unterhaltungen, Spektrum der Wissenschaft, Juli 2006Braungardt, Kotschick Die Klassifikation von Fu√üballmustern, Math.

If more than three faces meet at some vertex, then there is a method to generate infinite sequences of different soccer balls by a topological construction called a branched covering.

The street was named after railroad magnate Henry Huntington. It also served as one of the only thoroughfares between Los Angeles and Pasadena in the early 1900s. Portions of Huntington Drive were part of U.S. Route 66. The road has a wide median that was originally one of the lines of the Pacific Electric Railway. Route Description Huntington Drive begins at Soto Street in Lincoln Heights. South of Soto St. the road is Mission Road. The street heads north but quickly heads northeast through El Sereno, Los Angeles and then into South Pasadena, California. In South Pasadena, Huntington Drive intersects with Fair Oaks Avenue. The portion from Soto Street to Fair Oaks was part of the original routing for US 66\\\\. Past South Pasadena, Huntington continues through San Marino, California and passes just south of the Huntington Library. The road then goes through East San Gabriel, California and then Arcadia, California where it merges with Colorado Boulevard near Santa Anita Park. At this junction, Huntington Drive becomes another portion of US 66, passing through Monrovia, California and Duarte, California until Irwindale where it continues as Foothill Boulevard. History Huntington Drive was the major route between Los Angeles and Pasadena in the early 1900s until the opening of the Arroyo Seco Parkway. The median was a line of the Pacific Electric Railway which was owned by the street's namesake, Henry Huntington. When the railway discontinued service in 1951, the large median became a large lawn with trees, and the roadways either side of the median were reconfigured from bidirectional traffic to one-way traffic. In the 1930s, traveling on Huntington would have drove you by the Cawston Ostrich Farm in South Pasadena and in Monrovia a hot dog stand, the first restaurant opened by the McDonald brothers who would later create the fast-food restaurant McDonald's. Huntington Drive between Soto Street and Fair Oaks Avenue was the original alignment of US 66 from 1926 until around 1936 when it was re-routed to eventually the Arroyo Seco Parkway. Between Colorado Boulevard east to the Irwindale city limit it was signed as US 66 until it was decommissioned. The city of Duarte stenciled Route 66 logos onto the street in 2017 to commemorate the city's 60th anniversary.

She is Turkey's first drillship. Name Fatih means \\"Conqueror\\" in Turkish. The three drillships of the state-owned Turkish gas company, Fatih, Yavuz and Kanuni, are named after the most famous conquerors and rulers of the Ottoman Empire: Mehmed I (r. 1444-1446, 1451-1481), Turkish: Fatih Sultan Mehmet, Mehmed the Conqueror, who conquered Constantinople; Selim I (r. 1512-1520), known as Selim the Resolute, Turkish: Yavuz Sultan Selim, who hugely expanded his empire; and Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520-1566), known in Turkish as Kanun√Æ Sultan S√ºleyman (\\"the Lawgiver\\"), under whom the empire reached its apex.

The text is a reworking by Voltaire of the Italian tragedy Merope (1713) by Scipione Maffei, dating from 1736/1737. The play premiered in 1743 and first appeared in print in 1744. Background Scipione Maffei worked the classical story into his tragedy (it) Merope in 1713. Voltaire met Maffei in Paris in 1733 and secured his agreement that it should be adapted into a French tragedy.Siegfried Detemple: Die Franz√∂sische Merope, in: Voltaire: Die Werke. Katalog zum 300. Geburtstag. Reichert, Wiesbaden 1994, S. 71. Voltaire decided to premiere it only after the staging of his tragedy Mahomet, although he had completed work on it in 1737. Action The action takes place at the court of Messene. The queen dowager Merope, mourning her murdered husband Cresphonte regards the newcomer Egisthe as responsible for the murder of her son, when in fact he is her long-lost son. He presents himself at court and eventually deposes and kills the tyrannical usurper Polyphonte, who had killed his father. Egisthe then installs M√©rope as queen. Performance and critical reception The play was put on at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. After the premiere the audience called Voltaire onto the stage in front of the curtain - the first time this had ever happened in the history of French theatre. With 29 subsequent performances the play was a great success. It was also a commercial success, with receipts exceeding those of any previous play by Voltaire. Merope was revived in February and March the following year, attracting even larger audiences.Theodore Besterman: Herr und Gelehrter (1742-1746), in: Voltaire, Winkler, M√ºnchen, 1971, S. 228. Printed editions The first printed edition of the play was La M√©rope Fran√ßaise, avec quelques petites pi√®ces de Litterature, Paris, Chez Prault fils, Libraire, Quai de Conty, vis- √†-vis la descente du Pont-Neuf, √† la Charit√®, M. DCC. XLIV, 8¬∞, XXIV (II), 116 (II), 16 S. When the play was printed Voltaire added a preface, Avis au lecteur, in which he warned against pirate editions, and a letter of dedication to Scipione Maffei. The subtitle Pi√®ces fugitives de litt√©rature indicated that a number of other works were published together with the tragedy: Lettre sur l'esprit, Nouvelles consid√©rations sur l'histoire and Lettre √† M. Norberg, chapelain du roy de Su√®de Charles XII, auteur de l\`histoire de ce monarque. M√©rope was translated into English by Aaron Hill, who also translated other works by Voltaire, Zara (Zaire) and Alzira (Alzire) for the London stage.

It is an unstable compound that is readily attacked by nucleophylic compounds above ‚àí40 ¬∞C. 2,2'-Dipyrromethene and its more stable and easily prepared derivatives‚Äîformally obtained by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms by other functional groups‚Äîare important precursors for the family of BODIPY fluorescent dies. The derivatives include salts of the dipyrrinato anion and of the cation . Preparation 2,2'-Dipyrromethene and its derivatives can be obtained from suitable pyrrole derivatives by several methods. The unsubstituted compound can be prepared by oxidation of 2,2'-dipyrrolemethane with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) at ‚àí78 ¬∞C in dry dichloromethane solution. An alternative synthesis that avoids the oxidation step is the condensation of 2-formyl pyrrole and pyrrole catalyzed by trifluoroacetic acid, followed by deprotonation with ethyldiisopropylamine. More generally, one starts with a pyrrole with suitable substituents at positions 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2). Condensation of two such molecules at their 2 positions with a bridging compound gives the corresponding 2,2'-dipyrromethane. The condensation may use, for example, the Knorr pyrrole synthesis, with an aromatic aldehyde in the presence of TFA. The dipyrromethane core is then oxidized to dipyrromethene using a quinone oxidant such as DDQ or p-chloranil. center Alternatively, one may use an activated carboxylic acid derivative, usually an acyl chloride. As another possibility, one may condene a substituted pyrroles with a 2-acylpyrrole; this route allows the synthesis of unsymmetrical dipyrromethenes. Reactions Dipyrrin is unstable above ‚àí40 ¬∞C. However, its acts as a base, and its chloride [] [] is sufficiently stable in solution. The so-called BODIPY dyes can be obtained by reacting 2,2'-dipyrromethene or its derivatives with boron trifluoride-diethyl ether complex (¬∑) in the presence of triethylamine or 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU).

Set in 1914 Vienna, it tells the story of Lucius, a 22-year-old medical student, and a field hospital nurse following the outbreak of World War I. The novel focuses on themes including war, historical medical practices, family, and the role of chance in the formation of relationships, history and penance. It also describes the origins and early treatment of what Mason describes as \\"a new disease, born of the war\\", post traumatic stress disorder. Since the book's release Mason has stated that the book's title refers to both the character of Horvath and the main character Lucius, remarking ‚ÄúEven though the diagnostic mystery is Horvath, my interest is in who Lucius is. The title refers to both of them. But the real winter soldier is the doctor and the real investigation is of his trauma and regret.‚Äù  Synopsis  Set during World War I, the book follows Lucius, a medical student and son of wealthy parents. Disappointed that their son did not choose a more illustrious career, they are pleased when war breaks out and Lucius enlists in the military, expecting that he will redeem himself to them via battle. For his part, Lucius chooses to enlist because the war had been romanticized to him and his college offered early graduation for anyone willing to enlist. Lucius is surprised when he receives a position at a poorly staffed and equipped field hospital located in a church in the Carpathian Mountains, as this was the opposite of what he was expecting. He also finds that he is the outpost's only physician and that the other doctors abandoned their post, leaving only Sister Margarete to care for the outpost, which is stricken by typhus. Lucius is somewhat ill-equipped to care for his new charges, as his prior patients had only relatively minor issues and most of his knowledge came from book learning rather than practical experience. Determined to make the best of things, Lucius begins his work. The Sister is willing to help teach Lucius, who begins to grow attached to both her and the others in the hospital. Not all of his patients are exhibiting easily solved maladies, as some are diagnosed with \\"nervous shock\\", and Lucius finds that one of his patients, Horvath ‚Äì dubbed the \\"winter soldier\\" ‚Äì is displaying strange symptoms that hint at psychological or neurological causes. With few clues and the soldier himself mute and mentally shut off from the world, Lucius decides that he must cure this soldier at all costs. As the book progresses several recovering patients are sent to other hospitals, but Lucius is resistant to the idea of sending away Horvath; this stresses his relationship with Margarete, who is revealed to have lied about being a nun, as she believes that he's doing this for his own benefit and not Horvath's. Lucius is eventually forced to return to Vienna, where his mother pressures him to marry the daughter of an important man, Natasza. He agrees, despite having fallen in love with Margarete during his time at the church. Lucius had asked her to marry him, but she rebuffed him by running away in tears. This does not stop him from becoming obsessed with determining her whereabouts after the war, especially as his marriage to Natasza is particularly unhappy. He ultimately does discover Margarete, who Lucius finds has married Horvath and bore his child. This allows Lucius to move on with his life, no longer fixated on the couple.  Development  Mason began writing the novel around 2004, with The Winter Soldier taking about fourteen years to complete, during which time he published A Far Country and Death of the Pugilist. Initially he had planned for the book to be set in Freud's Vienna and center around a female patient and her relationships with her doctor and husband. Mason chose to shift the story to a field hospital during World War I while he was performing research for the story, after discovering \\"this moment in history where the Austro-Hungarian Army finds itself so ill-equipped for the war that they don‚Äôt have enough doctors. So they invest in medical students with no clinical training and send them off to hospitals\\". This resonated with Mason, who had then recently completed his own medical schooling, as he noted: \\"Most medical students, up until that moment in their lives, haven't suffered an illness as severe as the illnesses they will encounter in their patients. And it sounds so unbelievably na√Øve, but I don't think I'm the only one whose world is shaken by the duration and the depth of suffering that people go through\\". In a first draft, the character of Sister Margarete was a minor character whom Lucius encountered; Mason decided to expand her character more, as he found that he enjoyed writing her scenes. In further rewrites her character was expanded and she was changed from a character who \\"[walked] around with a gun, speaking in lofty language that lapses into vulgarities\\" into one that was \\"more human, quieter\\", which Mason stated was a challenge.  Reception  Critical reception for The Winter Soldier has been predominantly positive, with the New York Journal of Books praising the book and calling its ending \\"surprisingly satisfying\\". Writing for The New York Times, Anthony Marra cited Mason's research and the book's \\"improbable narrative pleasures\\" as a highlight, writing \\"Within the meticulously researched and magnificently realized backdrop of European dissolution, Mason finds his few lost souls, and shepherds them toward an elusive peace.\\" Newsday's Tom Beer opined that while the book \\"happens to draw on history\\" it \\"does what all the best novels do: Creates a world in which readers pleasurably lose themselves.\\" A review in The Washington Post by Ron Charles notes that the \\"beauty of Daniel Mason's new novel, The Winter Soldier, persists even through scenes of unspeakable agony\\". The San Francisco Chronicle's Datebook named The Winter Soldier one of the top ten books of 2018 and in a review, praised the attention to detail in the work. It was also placed on The Washington Post's list of \\"50 notable works of fiction in 2018\\". The Herald Scotland reviewed The Winter Soldier, commenting that the work showed that Mason \\"has honed his craft over two previous novels\\" and that it was \\"beautifully, elegantly written, Mason‚Äôs prose pitched at a level where it feels rich and lustrous but at the same time transparent and devoid of pomposity.\\" References Category:2018 American novels Category:Fiction set in 1914 Category:Novels set in the 1910s Category:Novels set in Europe Category:Books about war Category:Novels set during World War I ","title":"The Winter Soldier (novel)"},{"id":"58930117","text":"The geology of Grenada is part of the broader Volcanic Caribbees in the Lesser Antilles volcanic island arc.

It wages a guerrilla campaign against the Syrian Democratic Forces, the armed forces of the Kurdish-dominated proto-state of Rojava, as well as the United States.  Background  When the Syrian Civil War broke out, various rebel factions took control of much of eastern Syria. After a period of infighting among the insurgents, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) emerged victorious and absorbed or expelled other rebel groups from eastern Syria. Regardless of these developments, a large part of the civilian population living under rebel and later ISIL rule remained secretly supportive of the Syrian government. Eventually, ISIL was mostly defeated by the Kurdish- led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who took control of its territories. Many government loyalists regarded the SDF which was supported by foreigners such as the United States Armed Forces as just another illegitimate occupier. Furthermore, the new SDF-backed civilian administration in areas such as Raqqa proved unable to fully alleviate the local humanitarian crisis. Support for the government thus underwent a resurgence.  History  On 26 February 2018, loyalist militants in Raqqa officially banded together to fight the SDF and U.S. troops, and announced the foundation of the \\"Popular Resistance of the Eastern Region\\" or \\"Popular Resistance in Raqqa\\". In its first statement, the group framed its actions as struggle against the \\"tyrannical American enemy\\" and pro-American \\"terrorists from all corners of the earth\\" [i.e. the SDF]. Around the same time, Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently claimed that the \\"Shield of the Al-Jazira Heroes\\", a pro-government insurgent group was being set up in Raqqa's countryside. The combat capabilities of the \\"Popular Resistance\\" remained unclear; the group's first video showed just a few masked men with guns. The pro-opposition site Baladi News alleged that it was part of the pro-government forces that were fighting alongside the SDF against Turkey in the Afrin Region without providing any proof. The group is allegedly supported by Iran, and trained by the Baqir Brigade, a unit of the Syrian Armed Forces. Following its foundation, the group recruited locals opposed to the SDF's policies in Raqqa such as forced conscription, and the new administration's perceived lack of care for the interests and needs of the local people. The Popular Resistance of the Eastern Region uses Facebook to post content and has posted pictures and videos of supporters expressing their approval of the movement in ways such as raising Syrian flags, pictures of leaflets with pro-group writings and video statements. Videos of attacks on American forces and allied SDF militias have also been posted by the group. The group claimed in April 2018 to have carried out two attacks on U.S. positions at Ayn Issa, but these claims remained uncorroborated and were denied by the SDF. Overall, the group appears to be more focused on civil actions and propaganda than waging an actual insurgency. On 2 April 2018, another pro-government faction with a similar background emerged in the al- Hasakah Governorate. On 14 March 2019, two attacks reportedly targeted SDF convoys in Raqqa. According to the pro-government al-Masdar News, \\"some activists\\" claimed that the Popular Resistance of the Eastern Region was responsible for the attacks.

He was a staunch writer and orator against slavery and racism, eventually convincing President Abraham Lincoln to enact equal pay for black chaplains.  Birth and early life  Samuel Harrison was born into slavery in 1818 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was freed along with his mother in 1821. As a young man he was an apprentice shoemaker for his uncle when he felt a call towards being a minister. He began his education at the Peterboro Manual Labor School in Peterboro, New York, but as it closed shortly after his artival, at the suggestion of Gerrit Smith, the school's founder and patron, he moved to Western Reserve College and Preparatory School in Hudson, Ohio, where he studied from 1836‚Äì1839 and from which he graduated. During this time Harrison married his childhood sweetheart, Ellen Rhodes, and they later had 13 children. He was ordained and began work as the first minister of the 2nd Congregational Church of Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  Military service and equal pay debate  In 1862, Rev. Harrison resigned from the church and worked for the National Freedman's Relief Society during the American Civil War charged with helping the blacks on Georgia's sea islands. In July 1863, the 54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, the first all-black unit in the North during the Civil War, spearheaded the assault on Fort Wagner in Charleston, South Carolina. The regiment suffered heavy losses. Massachusetts Governor John A. Andrew sent Rev. Harrison to South Carolina to express the sympathies of the Commonwealth to the men of the 54th. Later that year, Rev. Harrison received a commission as chaplain and was mustered into the 54th, thus becoming one of 19 African-American chaplains during the Civil War. During this time, Rev. Harrison protested the unequal pay gap between white and black chaplains. His friendship with Massachusetts Governor John Albion Andrew allowed him enough sway for Andrew to draft a letter to Abraham Lincoln requesting that he end the racist practice, naming Rev. Harrison and describing his unequal experiences. In 1864, not a year later, President Lincoln equalized the pay scale. In 1864, Rev. Harrison was honorably discharged for health reasons. He would work for the National Freedman's Relief Society until the war ended.Samuel Harrison House website (accessed August 20, 2008)  Later life, death, and legacy  After being honorably discharged from the Army, Rev. Harrison ministered at several different churches in multiple Northeastern states. In the states of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maine he wrote pieces against the state of racial dynamics during the era of Reconstruction. He wrote his memoir, Rev. Samuel Harrison: His Life Story, printed in 1899, and in 1872 returned to pastor the Second Congregational Church of Pittsfield. During this time, Rev. Harrison would have 3 sermons printed. He died on August 11, 1900, in the city where he had begun his ministry. His house in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, deemed the Samuel Harrison House, was made a historic site in 2006.

He was elected the 38th president of Brazil on 28 October 2018 by obtaining 55.1% of the valid votes in the 2018 Brazilian general election, defeating Fernando Haddad. Background The president-elect Bolsonaro meets president Michel Temer Then President-elect Bolsonaro attending the congressional celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Constitution in 2018 Bolsonaro, at the time of his election, was a 27-year member of Congress; his victory has been credited to voter anger at the political class over years of corruption in politics, economic recession, and a surge in violent crime. According to sociologist Clara Ara√∫jo, ‚Äúthe dissatisfaction over the economic crisis, it seems to me, was channeled along with a discourse about conservative morals‚Äù. The economy of Brazil is recovering from crisis, with an unemployment rate of 12 percent at the time of the election, double that of five years prior. The crisis was caused by, among other factors, weak commodity prices; events revealed underlying weaknesses in the economy, which include poor infrastructure, excessive bureaucracy, an inefficient tax system, and corruption.  Cabinet and appointments  On 11 October 2018, days before his election victory, Bolsonaro had already announced DEM congressman Onyx Lorenzoni as the future Chief of Staff in his cabinet. On 31 October, President-elect Bolsonaro announced astronaut Marcos Pontes as the future Minister of Science and Technology; as of that date, he had already confirmed two other ministerial nominations: Paulo Guedes as Economy minister, and Augusto Heleno as Defense minister. However, on 7 November, Augusto Heleno was appointed to the Institutional Security Office of Brazil.General Heleno troca minist√©rio da Defesa no governo Bolsonaro pelo GSI (in Portuguese) On the first day of November, Bolsonaro confirmed that anti-graft judge S√©rgio Moro had accepted his invitation to serve as Justice minister. The decision drew backlash from the international press because Moro had convicted Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, Bolsonaro's chief political rival in the election, for money laundering and corruption. On 11 November 2018, O Estado de S. Paulo released a story stating that Bolsonaro's team has chosen World Bank director and former Finance minister Joaquim Levy to head the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES). A report was later issued by Folha de S. Paulo that Bolsonaro has yet to confirm the nomination of Levy to the post. A press release from Paulo Guedes's team, released the next day, confirmed Levy's appointment. On 15 November 2018, economist Roberto Campos Neto was named as the future Central Bank governor. In December 2018 the final composition has emerged after weeks of announcements and appointments. The cabinet will include 22 personnel, of which 16 are ministers, two are cabinet-level positions and four are secretaries directly linked to the presidency. The 22 figure is down from 29 in the outgoing administration. Seven of the ministers will be military men, eight have technocrat profiles, and seven are politicians. Hindustan Times commented that \\"there are just two women in Bolsonaro‚Äôs government, which is double the number in the outgoing lineup under President Michel Temer\\", and that \\"there are no blacks, despite half of Brazil‚Äôs population being at least partly descended from Africans. Alvim's 16 January speech On November 7th 2019, Roberto Alvim was nominated Special Secretary for Culture under the auspices of the Ministry of Tourism, only to be fired on January 17, 2020 after appearing to quote a speech by German Nazi politician Joseph Goebbels in a government-sanctioned video. The Bolsonaro cabinet on Inauguration Day, 1 January 2019 On 18 June 2020, Minister of Education Abraham Weintraub stepped back.Em v√≠deo ao lado de Bolsonaro, ministro Abraham Weintraub, da Educa√ß√£o, anuncia sa√≠da do cargo Domestic policy Logo of the Bolsonaro administration. \\"Beloved homeland, Brazil\\". In one of his first actions as president, Bolsonaro increased the minimum wage from R$954 to R$998. Within days of assuming office, Bolsonaro transferred land reform duties from the National Indigenous Foundation (FUNAI) to the Ministry of Agriculture. Most of the remaining duties previously assigned to FUNAI are now part of the Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights. Crime Official rates of violence in the country have been falling as a result of toughening laws, increasing police powers and implementing anti-violence programs. In the first 11 months of the first year of government, the murder rate fell 22.3%, attempted murder fell 9.5%, personal injury followed by death 3.5% and rape cases fell 10.9%. All other robbery and theft rates fell above 20% on average. Gun policy President Bolsonaro issued a decree to facilitate gun ownership in Brazil on 15 January 2019. The decree, signed by Bolsonaro in an event at Planalto Palace, extends valid ownership period from five to ten years and allows citizens to own up to four firearms. The decree loosens restrictions for gun possession but does not affect those for gun carry. In order to own a firearm, a citizen will have to provide proof of the \\"existence of a safe or a secure location for storage\\" of the weapon at home. Requirements for possession such as passing training courses and background checks remain, as does the minimum age requirement of 25 years. Education In May 2019, the government cut 30% of the education budget for three universities due to alleged issues with partisan activities. President Bolsonaro has supported the Escola sem Partido (ESP), which encourages students to film teachers to collect evidence for its allegation that the education system is dominated by progressive parties. Students protested the education cuts in Rio de Janeiro. Environment According to a report by the National Institute for Space Research the deforestation of the rainforests in Brazil has more than doubled within Bolsonaros presidency. Bolsonaro called the publication a lie and fired the institute's director, Ricardo Galv√£o. During August 2019, a record number of wildfires were recorded in the Amazon rainforest of Brazil as a result of the increased deforestation rate. Bolsonaro blamed this on NGOs attempting to embarrass the Brazilian government. In 2020, with the Pantanal fires, Bolsonaro, in the United Nations General Assembly, stated that \\"our forest is humid and doesn't allow fire to spread\\" and that the current fires are only caused by \\"indians and caboclos burning their own land for their survival\\", the truth of these statements is disputed. Defense In October 2019, Bolsonaro said that Brazil has stopped taking care of the Defense area, and needs to rearm. He also said that \\"Brazil needs new armaments\\", and that \\"nobody wants an extremely bellicose Brazil\\", but that the country \\"needs to have the least deterrent power\\".  COVID-19 pandemic Bolsonaro dismissed the threat of COVID-19, saying that it was a \\"little flu\\". Soon his justice minister Sergio Moro, resigned. https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/08/americas/brazil-coronavirus-bolsonaro- response-intl/index.html A leading medical journal, The Lancet has dubbed Bolsonaro as the biggest threat to Brazil amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. It said that Bolsonaro's disregard for and flouting of lockdown measures were sowing confusion in the Brazilian society. Bolsonaro has attacked lockdown measures implemented by some of the governors of Brazilian provinces. His health minister Nelson Teich resigned after serving only a month. Bolsonaro has also actively participated in anti-lockdown rallies. Brazil's health ministry hid from public view months of data on COVID-19 on 6 June, and stopped giving total counts of confirmed cases (above 672,000, second only to the United States) and deaths (more than 35,000). ‚ÄúThe cumulative data ... does not reflect the moment the country is in,‚Äù Bolsonaro wrote on Twitter. On 7 July, Bolsonaro announced that he had tested positive. Foreign policy Bolsonaro with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House, Washington, 19 March 2019 Foreign Affairs minister Ernesto Ara√∫jo had outlined five measures for the first 100 days of the Bolsonaro administration. The first two were official state visits of President Bolsonaro to the United States and Israel; the third was revising Mercosur policies; the fourth was restoring the coat of arms to the cover of the Brazilian passport; and the fifth was ending visa requirements for U.S. and Canadian citizens. During the 2018 presidential campaign, Bolsonaro said he would make considerable changes to Brazil's foreign relations, saying that the \\"Itamaraty needs to be in service of the values that were always associated with the Brazilian people\\". He also said that the country should stop \\"praising dictators\\" and attacking democracies, such as the United States, Israel and Italy. In early 2018, he affirmed that his \\"trip to the five democratic countries the United States, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan showed who we will be and we would like to join good people\\". Bolsonaro has shown distrust towards China throughout the presidential campaign claiming they \\"[want to] buy Brazil,‚Äù although Brazil recorded a US$20 billion trade surplus with China in 2018, and China is only the 13th largest source of foreign direct investment into Brazil. Bolsonaro said he wishes to continue to have business with the Chinese but he also said that Brazil should \\"make better [economic] deals\\" with other countries, with no \\"ideological agenda\\" behind it. His stance towards China has also been interpreted by some as an attempt to curry favor the Trump administration to garner concessions from the US. Bolsonaro said that his first international trip as president will be to Israel. Bolsonaro also said that the State of Palestine \\"is not a country, so there should be no embassy here\\", adding that \\"you don't negotiate with terrorists.\\" The announcement was warmly received by the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, who welcomed Bolsonaro to Israel in March 2019 during the final weeks of a re-election campaign, but was met with condemnation from the Arab League, which warned Bolsonaro it could damage diplomatic ties.https://www.timesofisrael.com/arab-league-warns-brazil- that-jerusalem-embassy-move-could-harm-ties/.\\"I love Israel,\\" Bolsonaro said in Hebrew at a welcoming ceremony, with Netanyahu at his side, at Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion airport.https://www.dw.com/en/i-love-israel-brazils-bolsonaro- lands-in-tel-aviv/a-48134150 Argentine President Mauricio Macri with Bolsonaro, 16 January 2019 Argentine President Mauricio Macri was the first foreign leader to be received by Bolsonaro on a state visit to Bras√≠lia since he assumed the Brazilian presidency. Bolsonaro praised Macri for ending the 12-years rule of N√©stor and Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, which he saw as similar to Lula and Rousseff. Although he does not have plans of leaving the Mercosur, he criticized that it gave priority to ideological issues instead of economic ones. A staunch anti-communist, Bolsonaro has condemned Cuba's former leader Fidel Castro and the current regime in that island. Bolsonaro with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, 31 March 2019 Bolsonaro has also praised U.S. President Donald Trump and his foreign policy. Bolsonaro's son Eduardo has indicated that Brazil should distance itself from Iran, sever ties with Nicol√°s Maduro's government in Venezuela and relocate Brazil's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Bolsonaro is widely considered to be the most pro-American candidate in Brazil since the 1980s. PSL members have said that if elected, he will dramatically improve relations between the United States and Brazil. During an October 2017 campaign rally in Miami, he saluted the American flag and led chants of \\"USA! USA!\\" to a large crowd. U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton praised Bolsonaro as a 'like-minded' partner and said his victory was a \\"positive sign\\" for Latin America. Bolsonaro praised Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill, saying that he had learned from Churchill: \\"Patriotism, love for your fatherland, respect for your flag ‚Äì something that has been lost over the last few years here in Brazil ... and governing through example, especially at that difficult moment of the Second World War.\\" Bolsonaro said he's open to the possibility of hosting a U.S. military base in Brazil to counter Russian influence in the region. With the intention of the U.S. President Donald Trump to make Brazil a NATO member in March 2019, Bolsonaro said: \\"the discussions with the United States will begin in the coming months\\". After protests for over his use of \\"homophobic, racist and misogynist remarks\\", a ceremony hosted by Brazilian- American Chamber of Commerce and set to award United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Bolsonaro with person of the year awards for \\"fostering closer commercial and diplomatic ties between Brazil and the United States\\" was cancelled. Immigration Bolsonaro speaking to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2019 On 8 January 2019, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ernesto Ara√∫jo asked diplomats to inform the UN that Brazil had withdrawn from the Global Compact for Migration. Venezuela The Bolsonaro administration declared on 12 January 2019 that it recognizes Juan Guaid√≥, the acting president of Venezuela appointed by the National Assembly, as the legitimate president of Venezuela amidst the Venezuelan presidential crisis. Free trade Bolsonaro supported the European Union‚ÄìMercosur Free Trade Agreement, which would form one of the world's largest free trade areas.  2019 investigations  Of the new ministers announced, five are or were subjected to investigation: Luiz Henrique Mandetta, Tereza Cristina, Onyx Lorenzoni, Paulo Guedes and Marcos Pontes. Onyx Lorenzoni, the Chief of Staff, is suspected of receiving an undeclared amount of R$100,000 in campaign donations in 2012 and 2014, the latter of which he confessed to. Tereza Cristina, the minister of Agriculture, is accused of having benefited JBS in a process of land leasing while she was Secretary of State for Agrarian Development and Production of Mato Grosso do Sul. Cristina has defended her actions as \\"acting in accordance with government policy\\". Economy minister Paulo Guedes is under investigation by the Federal Police for allegations that he mismanaged public pension funds. Science and Technology minister Marcos Pontes was investigated by military prosecutors in 2007 for supposedly making commercial use of his public image before entering the military reserve, which is forbidden according to the Military Penal Code. Pontes denied wrongdoing, stating that \\"there is nothing irregular in my professional activities\\". Health minister Mandetta is being probed for alleged procurement fraud, influence peddling and undeclared campaign donations. After allegations of campaign-finance fraud, Bolsonaro fired Gustavo Bebianno, a top adviser and general secretary for the president. His party was accused of diverting public campaign funds to candidates that did not run for office. Bebianno claimed to have formal documentation for all the funds he requested at direction by the State. In July 2019, it was reported that Bolsonaro and other cabinet members were the targets of a cellphone hacking operation to expose corruption in high-profile trials.  2020 political crisis  Investigations continued in 2020. In April 2020 justice minister Sergio Moro resigned, alleging that Bolsonaro was improperly pressuring him to remove the federal police chief; Bolsonaro subsequently removed and replaced the chief with a family friend of Bolsonaro. Police executed search warrants against key Bolsonaro supporters in May 2020 on charges of libel and intimidation, prompting Bolsonaro, while wearing a tie decorated with images of assault rifles, to exclaim \\"This is fucking over.\\" Bolsonaro attended protests in 2020 that The Guardian characterized as \\"anti- democratic protests where demonstrators have called for congress and the supreme court to be closed or even torched.\\" On 30 May 2020 prominent Bolsonaro opponents, across the political spectrum, expressed unity against Bolsonaro and launched the Movimento Estamos Juntos (\\"We Are Together Movement\\"). Lower-house speaker Rodrigo Maia publicly mulled a future impeachment of Bolsonaro \\"at the appropriate time\\", but stated that for now the priority was to fight the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.  Surveys  According to a survey by Ibope, released by the National Confederation of Industry on 13 December 2018, 75% of Brazilian population thought that Bolsonaro was \\"on the right way\\", while 14% thought Bolsonaro was \\"on the wrong way\\" and another 11%, did not respond. On 23 December 2018, Folha de S√£o Paulo published a survey of Datafolha in which 65% of respondents said that the Bolsonaro's government would be a high increase in the improvement of the Brazilian economy, while 6% said that it would be a high worsening in the current economic situation of the country and another 29%, did not respond. This was the highest rate of optimism regarding the future of the economy since 1997, when Fernando Henrique Cardoso was re-elected president. Another Datafolha survey, published on 1 January 2019, showed that 65% of respondents believe the Bolsonaro administration will be \\"great or good\\"; 17% believe it will be \\"regular\\", 12% believe it will be \\"bad or awful\\", while 6% did not respond. This rate of optimism regarding the administration is smaller than those for the first terms of presidents Collor, Cardoso, Lula and Dilma but higher than those of Franco and Temer. Since his election, his popularity is steadily declining. Another Datafolha survey, published on 21 May 2019, showed that 34% of respondents consider the Bolsonaro administration as \\"great or good\\"; 26% as \\"regular\\", 36% as \\"bad or awful\\", while 4% did not respond. This is the first time more Brazilians reject the politics of Bolsonaro than affirming it.Desaprova√ß√£o do Governo Bolsonaro supera aprova√ß√£o pela primeira vez, mostra pesquisa Atlas Pol√≠tico Later in 2020, his popularity bounced back up and was the highest since his inauguration.

Her pioneering work and leading contributions changed the literary curriculum at Berkeley and other institutes and universities in the United States of America and has normalized the presence of women's voices and writings as part of the syllabus in such departments.  Education  Deirdre Eberly Lashgari was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan on April 7, 1941. She earned a bachelor's degree in English and French in 1963, a Master of Arts in English in 1965, a Master of Arts in Near Eastern Languages in 1968, and a Doctor of Philosophy in Comparative Subjects Literature in 1987, all from the University of California, Berkeley Lashgari was a Fulbright scholar in Iran in 1969 where she studied Western and folk influences on modern Iranian poetry and Iranian women's changing roles in cities and villages.  Works  Lashgari is best known for her edited book Violence, Silence, and Anger: Women's Writing as Transgression (1995), which pays special attention to the works produced by well-known authors such as Harriet Jacobs, Virginia Woolf, Adrienne Rich and Audre Lord, as well Senegal's Mariama Ba, Lebanon's Etel Adnan, and Jamaica's Sistren Collective. The contributors to this book introduce the diverse areas of literary productions that embrace various forms of violence such as the colonial experiences of violence, sexual violence and war. They look into many forms of responses to violence and aim to address women's strategies of violating societal norms that confronts the readers with the realities of women's lives and their responses to violence. She collaborated with (Bankier and Earnshaw, et al.) and edited two international poetry anthologies;The Other Voice: Women's Poetry in Translation (Norton, 1976) and Women Poets of The World (Macmillan, 1983). Her story of collectivist works is written in The Berkeley Literary Women's Revolution: Essays from Marsha's Salon (McFarland 2004). In her article \\"Absurdity and Creation in the Work of Sadeq Hedayat\\" (1982), Lashgari criticizes Sadegh Hedayat for offering thoughts on problems without presenting solutions to those issues. She believes that Hedayat raises questions in his literary works but he leaves them with no answers. She raises her concerns for responsibility in Sadegh Hedayat's works but also thinks that Hedayat leaves his readers to experience and forces them to choose. Lashgari taught the first courses on women's literature. She researched and published Iranian fiction and cinema, female authors of fiction and poetry in countries such as United States, India, Iran, Ghana and China. She was professor emerita of English at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.  Personal life  Lashgari was married twice. She died on August 16, 2014 in Los Angeles at the age of 73.

Early life  Kent was born on 11 November 1903 in Tianjin, China, where his father, Percy Horace Braund Kent, OBE, MC, was a barrister in the consular court specialising in Anglo-Chinese commerce; his mother, Anna Mary n√©e Simcox, was the daughter of an English clergyman. He was educated in England: at a preparatory school in Malvern and then Rugby School, before going up to Merton College, Oxford.  Career  After graduation in 1926, Kent joined the practice of Sir Donald Somervell as a pupil, and two years later he was called to the bar. At the same time, the market downturn after the Wall Street Crash led him to pursue, briefly, a literary career. He was published in Punch and authored The Tenant of Smuggler's Rock (1930) and The Black Castle (1931). But literary pursuits did not satisfy him and the need for a regular source of income brought on by the birth of his first child encouraged him to fully return to the legal profession. He joined the office of the Second Parliamentary Counsel at the beginning of 1933 and was responsible for helping to draft legislation. In 1940 he was appointed a Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury, where he was responsible firstly for drafting emergency wartime legislation, and then in peacetime for drafting many of the historic (and complex) acts implemented by the Attlee government, such as those concerning universal healthcare and the nationalisation of major industries. In 1953, he was appointed HM Procurator General and Treasury Solicitor, most notably serving as solicitor to the Vassall Tribunal. He retired from Government service in 1963, but remained active in law: he was Standing Counsel to the General Synod of the Church of England from 1964 to 1972 and Vicar-General of the Province of Canterbury from 1971 to 1976; he was, finally, Dean of the Arches from 1972 to 1976.\\"Sir Harold Kent\\", The Times (London), 1 January 1999, p. 19.\\"Kent, Sir Harold Simcox\\", Who Was Who (online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007). Retrieved 31 October 2018. Kent was appointed to every grade of the Order of the Bath: Companion in 1946, Knight Commander in 1954 and, the highest, Knight Grand Cross in 1963. He was made a Queen's Counsel in 1973, and was awarded a Lambeth degree, Doctor of Civil Law, in 1977. In retirement, he lived in Gloucestershire. He died on 4 December 1998. Family Kent was survived by his son James; his wife, Zillah n√©e Lloyd, whom he had married in 1930, died in 1987, and their daughter Margaret had died in 1963.

The church is dedicated to Our Lady of Victory and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of S√£o Salvador da Bahia. The church was built in approximately 1561 by the Portuguese, and is the second-oldest church in Brazil. The church was listed as a historic structure by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute in 2005. It has a large collection of 18th-century Baroque images on the high altar. The fa√ßade of the church faced west to the Bay of All Saints until 1808. The church building was reoriented east in 1808, possibly in conjunction with the visit of John VI of Portugal to Bahia. The fa√ßade of the church was again greatly modified in 1910 to the present Neoclassical design; it is white with a Roman triangular pediment and elaborate decoration. A large-scale renovation of the church was carried out between 2014 and 2015. The work included improvements to the frescoes, secular paintings, the painting of the nave ceiling, the font, various sacred art objects, the high altar, and tombstones. History The first record of the existence of the Church of Our Lady of Victory is via tombstone, which records the first marriage of Portuguese colonists in Bahia. Definitive record of the church structure dates to 1561 in a location outside of the city of Salvador, which consisted solely of a small area around the present-day Historic Center of the city. The church building was constructed facing west towards the Bay of All Saints. The church was possibly fully rebuilt in 1808, at the time Dom Jo√£o VI visited Bahia; the fa√ßade, formerly facing the bay, was reoriented to the opposite direction to the east. The interior of the church is decorated in the Neoclassical style typical of 19th- century churches in Brazil; its chancel features low walls of lioz limestone and multi-chromatic azulejos, both imported from Portal. Protected status The tomb inscriptions of the Church of Our Lady of Victory were listed as protected historic property (bem m√≥vel ou integrado) in 1938 under inscription number 122. The church, both the structure and its contents, was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 2005 under inscription number 1528.

It is located in Burnside Hall at McGill's downtown campus in Montreal. History Mathematics was taught at McGill as early as 1848 when it was a discipline of Natural Philosophy. Mathematics at McGill was initially divided into two largely independent departments, one under the Faculty of Arts and Science and another under the Faculty of Engineering; the two departments merged in 1924 under the chairmanship of Daniel Murray. Still, mathematics remained subsidiary to other programs, owing to McGill's emphasis on engineering and British-style applied mathematics. Until 1945, Mathematics was almost wholly a service department with only seven faculty members. Though a small graduate program was shared with the Physics Department, most of the students in the program were headed for further graduate work in physics. In 1945, Department members Lloyd Williams and Gordon Pall founded the Canadian Mathematical Congress, which took the lead in persuading the National Research Council to make funds available for the support of pure mathematics. Meanwhile, as chairman of the Department, A. H. S. Gillon initiated in 1945 an Applied Mathematics program and in 1948 recommended for appointment to a professorship Hans Zassenhaus, a pure mathematician who began to attract a number of strong graduate students into his program. Zassenhaus, along with Professors Wac≈Çaw Kozakiewicz, Charles Fox, Edward Rosenthall, and Phil Wallace, was instrumental in developing the Department's Graduate School. McGill's first mathematics Ph.D. was awarded to Joachim Lambek, who obtained his doctorate in 1950 under Zassenhaus's supervision. In 1963, as public funds came to the university and a larger budget became available, the newly appointment chairman, Edward Rosenthall, concentrated on building a balanced and well-qualified academic team, which could sustain a vigorous graduate program along with the demands made upon the Department in a service capacity. Analysis and algebra became strong elements in the Department's program in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, and there was also a lively interest in statistics and in applied mathematics. Research in category theory began in 1966, when Lambek decided to promote the subject at McGill. The number of full-time staff in the Department had grown to 36 by 1960, and to 56 by 1970. The Departmental library was established in 1971, and dedicated in 1987 in honour of Edward Rosenthall. At the time of its closure in 2015, the Rosenthall Library held over 14,000 mathematics journals dating from the nineteenth century, more than 10,000 monographs, as well as a collection of rare mathematics books. Research Members of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics are active in directing research in algebraic geometry, analysis, applied mathematics, category theory and logic, discrete mathematics, geometric group theory, number theory, and probability and statistics.

Notable inventions include patented improvements to the chamber commode and refrigerator.  Career  In the late 1800s, African Americans were a growing population in pharmacy work. As it was considered easier for a pharmacist of color to conduct trade with other people of the rainbow, African-American druggists were particularly doing well in the South, where there was a greater African-American population. Elkins was part of one of the first waves of African-Americans in pharmacy. He received his education in pharmacy from Dr. Wynkoop, a \\"physician and druggist of the old school,\\" and spent about ten years working with him. Elkins ran a small drugstore, which was located on North Swan St. for the first four years, and later moved to Broadway and Livingston St., where it lasted thirteen more years. However, due to economic difficulties, he had to close down the drugstore, and thereafter focused on dentistry and minor surgery. He trained T.H. Sands Pennington, and helped him land a position in the pharmacy of H.B. Clement, where Pennington went on to have a distinguished career.

It first appeared in book form in the hardcover collection The Wheels of If and Other Science Fiction (Shasta, 1948); the collection was reprinted in paperback by Berkley Books in 1970. The story has been translated into German. Plot summary Biochemist Homer Osborn of the San Antonio branch of the Federal Research Laboratories has been working on a formula for synthetic beef. While not as good as actual beef, it may prove lucrative for his employer, as beef consumption has been prohibited by the Assembly of the Federation of Democratic and Libertarian States, which includes both the U.S. and India. As representation in the assembly is by population, the cow protectionist Indian majority forced through an anti-vaccacide law and made it mandatory on all member states. The law prohibits \\"the eating of cattle, which term shall include all animals of the subfamily Bovinae of the family Bovidae, the same comprising kine, buffaloes, bison, zebus, gayals, bantengs, yaks, and species closely related thereto, or any parts of members thereof,\\" as well as \\"the killing, for any purpose whatever, and the assault, molestation, capture, imprisonment, sale, purchase, possession, transportation, importation into or exportation out of the Federation of Democratic and Libertarian States, or any territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof, for purpose of eating, of cattle.\\" There has been much resistance to this new version of prohibition in the U.S., and \\"steaklegging,\\" controlled by Mexican cattle kings, is rampant. Osborn's department head Charles Kenny decides to treat him to the real thing for comparative purposes, so under the pretense of fishing, the two row out into the wetlands along the lower Nueces River with a package of contraband steaks, weighted for quick disposal. After they set up their campfire Osborn starts cooking the meat while Kenny goes for firewood. While the latter is away, the law arrives in the form of Guja Singh, a towering Sikh of the Fodals or Border Patrol, who arrests Osborn and escorts him toward his patrol car. Guja is the son of prominent Indian politician Arjan Singh. The bust is in turn busted, however, when both captor and captive are ambushed and abducted by cattle-runners. Osborn soon realizes these are no local steakleggers, but agents of one of the Big Three Mexican cattle kings who control much of the illicit beef traffic into the U.S. Sure enough, Osborn and Singh are taken to the secret compound of Harmodio Dualler, one of the three, in Mexico's Bols√≥m de Mapim√≠. There they meet the \\"critter king,\\" who sees in Osborn's work potential competition. Dismissing protestations that the labs' synthetic protein cannot possibly compete with real beef, Dualler demands of him all his samples, notes and writings, on pain of death. The Sikh he is initially unsure what to do with, deeming it dangerous to either kill, keep or release him. The prisoners are incarcerated until nightfall, when they are brought out to eat with their captors. As the meal consists of steak, Guja protests it is against his beliefs to eat it, until assured it is some of Osborn's synthetic beef. Osborn, however, realizes it's too good to be the real thing, and after they eat lets Guja know the steakleggers have fooled him. Guja tries to fight but quickly despairs and gives up, convinced he is ruined. Dualler informs him it's a ploy to ensure he won't make trouble after his release; the meal has been filmed for purposes of blackmail. Later, back in their cells, Guja passes Osborn a pistol he had concealed in his turban, which the steakleggers didn't think to search. Having heard their captors plotting to kill Osborn after obtaining his secrets, lest he later replicate his work, the Sikh feels one of them should have a chance. For his own part, he attempts to hang himself, but is caught and prevented. The next day Osborn is taken to Dualler's communication room, where the latter has him make a television call to Charley Kenny's office to have his work delivered to the cartel. But once the connection is made, Osborn presses Guja's pistol into his captor's ribs and orders the Sikh brought in. He apprises Kenny of the situation and directs him to switch the call to Arjan Singh in Delhi. Once Guja is present, Osborn ascertains from him the number of votes his father controls in the Assembly, and confirms it is enough to secure the repeal of the anti-vaccacide law currently before that body. Then he forces Dualler to demand Arjan Singh swing the debate in return for Guja's life. Conscious of their family honor, neither Arjan nor Guja buckles to the threat‚Äîuntil the blackmail film is brought up. Arjan breaks down and agrees. Realizing his enterprise is doomed if the anti- vaccacide law is repealed, Dualler suddenly grapples with Osborn, who, unable to shoot, flips his pistol to Guja. Guja dispatches Dualler and the two prisoners start a fire in the communications room, after which they burst out, proclaiming the communications apparatus has exploded and injured the critter king. In the ensuing confusion Osborn and Guja sneak from the compound, steal a truck, and make their escape. Later they arrive at the labs in San Antonio, where Kenny informs them the repeal act has passed. The bewildered Guja Singh finds himself a hero due to his father's pivotal role in the vote, while Osborn, now that there is no need for his synthetic beef, prepares to shake the dust of San Antonio from his feet and return to his native Brooklyn.

It will consist of a single pad for use by Angara rockets. The launch complex is expected to be completed by December 2022 and is being constructed by Kazan Corporation. By October 8, 2018 the entire area of the Angara launch pad was cleared of trees, an activity which began at the end of August. History November 23, 2018 JSC Tyazhmash began to assemble the first metal structures for the cable filling tower, which will have 17 floors and consist of 44 elements. The mass of one element is about 30 tons, the height is 3.3 meters. On December 7, 2018, a source in the rocket and space industry told the media that full-scale construction work would be launched from 2019 (earlier, in August 2017, Ruslan Mukhamedzhanov, general director of TsENKI NIISK affiliate, told the media that trenches could only be started after the ground was thawed spring warming). At the moment, there are various preparatory work. All construction works stipulated by the contract with the PSP \\"Kazan\\", which received positive positive conclusions of the Glavgosexpertiza in May 2018, are carried out in accordance with the schedule. On January 23, 2019, Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov, following a meeting on the financial and economic status of the state corporation Roskosmos and its subordinate organizations, told the media that the contract with the PSO Kazan was terminated by mutual agreement of the parties. Idle time in construction amounted to almost half a year, as a result of which the deadline for the delivery of the second line of the eastern line shifted in 2021, but not later than 2023. A new contractor will be hired for construction, and no plans are to be made to freeze the construction. May 30, 2019 saw the actual start of construction. On June 4, 2019 the head of Roskosmos, Dmitry Rogozin told the media that construction work had begun and work was being done to excavate the soil.. On June 9, 2019, a source at the Cosmodrome told the media that on June 8, builders began digging a pit under the second launch pad using excavators. On July 26, 2019, the head of Roskosmos Dmitry Rogozin told the media that the construction of the launch pad continues, despite heavy rains in the region for a month. On August 22, Roscosmos confirmed that there was no lag behind the schedule due to heavy rains: the contractor promptly implements the necessary water disposal measures. On August 29, 2019, the head of TsENKI (), Kirill Filenkov, told the media that factory tests of the support device of the first four floors of the cable-filling tower had been completed successfully and they began sending them to the spaceport. Dispatch will be completed on time with an estimated launch date for Angara-A5 in the fourth quarter of 2023. On September 1, the head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozi, announced on Twitter that on September 2, the foundation pit would begin concreting and 1.5 thousand cubic meters of concrete would be poured. On September 1, 2019, Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov in an interview with the media said that the Cabinet was dissatisfied with the pace of construction of the second stage. A change in the contractor is not ruled out: instead of the PSO Kazan, the second stage can be independently completed by a public law company that will unite all the construction assets of the Ministry of Defense [58]. On September 5, 2019, a source in the rocket and space industry told the media that the facilities of the second stage - the launch under the Angara, the command post and the fuel storage - are being built ahead of schedule for a month. To erect a command post, a pit was dug and the concrete base was half-poured; for storage of fuel is the formation of beds under the tank.

Education and career  David S. Weiss has post B.A. degrees from Columbia University (M.A. and M.Ed.), Yeshiva University (M.S.) and University of Toronto (Ph.D.). He specialized in organizational psychology and was an organizational and business strategist as a partner of Geller, Shedletsky and Weiss (1987 ‚Äì 2001), as Vice President and Chief Innovation Officer of Knightsbridge Human Capital Solutions (2002 ‚Äì 2007), and as president of Weiss International Ltd (2007 ‚Äì present). Weiss is a Certified Director with the Institute of Corporate Directors and was a Director on the Board of the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre Foundation and an Advisory Board Member of the Institute for Performance and Learning. He was honored as the first lifetime Fellow of the Institute for Performance and Learning and as the fourth Lifetime Fellow of the Human Resources Professionals Association.  Authorship and concepts  Weiss‚Äô first book, Beyond the Walls of Conflict (translated into French) described how to apply mutual gains negotiations to enhance the likelihood of labour management peace. His second book, High Impact HR (2nd Edition called High Performance HR, 2000) explored how HR can be more strategic and how it can build people and organizational capabilities. High Impact HR was ranked as #4 on the list of best selling business books in 1999. The book describes four HR value propositions of culture, alignment, change, and ROI of human capital and introduces the concept of how HR can define HR metrics and abandon work with discipline. Weiss's next two books were The Leadership Gap (translated into Korean) co-authored with Vince Molinaro on the topic of holistic leadership and its sequel Leadership Solutions with Vince Molinaro and Liane Davey on the topic of how to measure the leadership gap. The Leadership Gap ranked #3 on the list of best selling business books by the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail in May 2011. It claims that the growth of an organization can outstrip its capacity to cultivate a sufficient quantity of leaders, and that this \\"leadership gap\\" can be corrosive. The book proposes a system for identifying high priority gaps and filling them. Reviewing the book in the Journal of Organizational Excellence, LaRoi Lawton said, \\"The highly motivated, self-directed reader can gain a great deal of learning and other results from using the guidelines and materials in this timely book.\\" Writing about the book in CMA Management magazine, Robert Coleman stated \\"Building leadership capacity for the future can be a challenge, and pundits have started to jump into the fray.\\" The book review in the same issue comments that \\"The Leadership Gap provides a road map for creating such an [leadership development] environment.\\" His fifth book, Maimonides Cure of Souls co- authored with David Bakan and Dan Merkur explored the psychological writings of Moses Maimonides and the role of Maimonides as a precursor to the writings of Sigmund Freud. Mordechai Beck reviewed the book in the Jerusalem Post. Beck writes that the book brings up the tantalizing possibility that the Rambam (Maimonides), the great medieval thinker, acted as precursor to the originator of modern-day psychoanalysis. His sixth book Innovative Intelligence (translated to Chinese and to Persian) co-authored with Claude Legrand was a \\"top 5 business book for 2011\\" reported by CBC News. Harvey Schachter, a writer with The Globe and Mail Report on Business, referred to the book as \\"a road map for harnessing creativity\\". The book introduces the need for innovation leadership by developing ‚Äòleaders of innovation‚Äô who draw out from diverse teams their insights and innovative solutions to complex situations. Weiss also wrote Decision Making for Complex Situations co-authored with Ted Cadsby and published in the Rotman Magazine, 2017, which explores four distinct stages for handling complex situations. Each is designed to avoid the decision-making mistakes that leaders and their teams are vulnerable to when confronting complexity. His seventh book, Leadership-Driven HR describes the road map for HR to drive value for the business, guide HR to deliver value through leaders, and ensure that HR is driven to lead. Subsequently, he wrote \\"The Leadership-Driven HR Transformation\\", \\"South Africa Human Capital Review\\" and \\"HR: Driver of Innovation\\" for HR Professional. Weiss also contributed four articles for the book The Trainer's Portable Mentor edited by Terrence L. Gargiulo, namely \\"Taxonomy of Learning Designs\\", \\"Trusting Relationships in Learning\\", \\"The Integrated Approach to Leadership Development\\" (with Vince Molinaro), and \\"The Trainer as a CAPABLE Leader\\" (with Molinaro). For the Banff Centre, he wrote \\"Driving Employee Engagement\\", again with Molinaro.[16] Weiss's most recent articles include \\"Lift-off: Change management from concept to end results\\", which was published in Human Resources Directors, and \\"Meaningful Dialogue for Association Boards\\", published in Association Magazine in English and French  References  Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Teachers College, Columbia University alumni Category:Yeshiva University alumni Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:Organizational psychologists ","title":"David Solomon Weiss"},{"id":"58931074","text":"Xpedition may refer to: * Xpedition (ship), a cruise ship for celebrity cruises and one of three vessels making up the Xpedition class * Xpedition class * Xpedition (CAD software), an EDA tool by Mentor Graphics See also \\\\+ Expedition (disambiguation) ","title":"Xpedition"},{"id":"58931093","text":"Hatting may refer to: *Hatmaking *Hatting, Denmark **Hatting Parish in Horsens Municipality, Denmark *Hatting, Tyrol, Austria *Hatting, Upper Austria, Austria, in Sankt Marienkirchen am Hausruck *John Hatting, ex-husband and singing partner of Lise Haavik *Flat-hatting, Aerobatic trick involving extremely low flight See also *Hattin (disambiguation) ","title":"Hatting"},{"id":"58931108","text":"The Family Allowance Act (the Act) is an Act of the Parliament of Canada, legislated in 1944 and initiated in 1945, as the first universal welfare program implemented in Canada, passed under the leadership of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. As a governmental Income Security Expenditure, payments were transferred directly to the individual who qualified for them, in this case the mother of the children concerned. As is characteristic of some Security Expenditures, the benefits were approved for qualified families regardless of overall income, or any other factors related to need. Background Initially, the payments were untaxed, and varied depending on age and number of children under care, with an average payment of five dollars to each family per child per month. Several minor amendments were made in the following years, varying provincially. In 1974, a substantial amendment was made to the Act, with payments raised to twenty dollars per month, with some provincial differences with respect to age and number of children in the family. The payments also became taxable. Several amendments were made to the Act from that point on, such as increasing the age of coverage to seventeen years of age for the province of Quebec in 1961, and for the rest of the country in 1964. In 1992, the Family Allowance Act was folded in with other social welfare programs into the Child Tax Benefit. The idea for implementing a family allowance came in the context of the major depression of the 1930s in which many families within Canada were struggling. The state received pressure to provide assistance and in 1940 amended legislation to permit statewide unemployment insurance, the beginning of social supports offered throughout the country. These circumstances prompted politicians to propose federal legislation to offer more welfare services. The Act was informed by the Marsh Report in 1943, which outlined a reconstruction plan for the country after World War II and was written to address the poverty in Canada. It suggested several welfare programs, including a family allowance program. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King's government selected just family allowance to implement. The proposed benefits of the program were predicted to help the declining post-war economy, and in general, was aimed to aid families in Canada during that time. It was also suggested that this would help attain horizontal equity, which acknowledged those providing for children had a larger financial burden and so require more assistance than those without children to support. Further, that it would help maintain the overall citizens purchasing power, helping to avoid destabilization of the economy. To qualify for the benefits offered by the government at the time the act was initiated in 1945, the family would only be considered eligible for assistance under the conditions that there were children under the age of 16 in care, the family maintained a permanent residence, and the children were enrolled in the school system. Criticism Common critiques of the Act at the time included concerns that taxpayer money was being wasted due to the payments being sent to everyone who qualified indiscriminately, without determining if they needed financial help at all. The reasoning given by the government was that calculating each potential recipient‚Äôs annual income would be costlier than the benefits given to the minority of high-income earners. There were also political criticisms, claiming the motivation for the family allowance act was largely an attempt to get the vote of French Canadians, who had larger families on average. Others advocated for service-based assistance, while those in favour of the direct payment method suggested this would unnecessarily restrict individual financial freedom and choice. Indigenous applicability Given the basic requirements, the act did not apply evenly to everyone living in Canada and depended upon their relationship with the Canadian state. Although there was no mention of the exclusion of Indigenous families directly in the Family Allowance Act, the Indian Act modified how this legislation applied to Indigenous peoples. The Indian Act was amended in 1920 to make Residential School attendance mandatory for children up to the age of 15, and in 1930 up to the age of 16. In order to receive the benefits under the Family Allowance Act, the children in Indigenous communities were required to attend Residential Schools. Exceptions were also made for Immigrant families, in which first year immigrants were not eligible until an amendment made in 1961.

Early years H. N. Charles was born on 22 November 1893 in Barnet the son of Thomas Charles, a Solicitor, and his wife Constance Emily. and educated at Highgate school and University College London where he gained a degree in engineering. In 1914 he joined the Royal Naval Air Service as a mechanic before moving to the Royal Flying Corps where he was Engineering Officer to No 56 Squadron. By the end of the war he had been promoted to Captain. After the war he joined Zenith Carburettors as a Sales Engineer and then Automotive Products before getting a job in 1924 as a trouble shooter with Morris Motors at Cowley. MG In 1925 Hubert Charles met Cecil Kimber of the MG Car Company and although still working for Morris started doing work for MG in his spare time making the MG bodies fit the new Morris Oxford chassis and went on to design a \\"Comparator\\", an early rolling road, on which cars could be adjusted. In 1928 he officially joined MG as Chief Draughtsman. The MG M-type Midget was launched in 1929 with the overhead camshaft Wolseley engine of 20bhp output which did not satisfy Charles so he revised the camshaft increasing the power to 27bhp for 1930. This work led him on to the supercharged engine for the C-Type, still based on the original Wolsley design, where the output was 62bhp. As engine power increased the traditional leaf sprung chassis increasingly could not cope so Charles designed a backbone chassis with all-round independent suspension for the R-Type. In 1935 MG became part of Morris Motors and Charles was moved to the main design office at Cowley where he worked on cars for both marques including designing the front suspension for the Morris Ten. Later life H. N. Charles left Morris in 1938 to join Rotol Airscrews as Chief Engineer where he developed a reversing gear and a blade-feathering device. before joining Austin in 1943 as development engineer and was responsible for the coil-sprung front suspension of the Austin A40. He clashed with the chairman of Austin Leonard Lord and left the company in 1958 to found his own engineering consultancy. Hubert Charles retired to Teddington in around 1961 and died in Oxford on 18 January 1982 at the age of 88.

During the 1960s he played and recorded with several musicians such as Alexis Korner, John McLaughlin, Pete Brown, Denny Laine, Vincent Crane and Duffy Power. In 1972 he was convicted for the manslaughter of his parents and brother-in-law and detained at Broadmoor Hospital. Early life His parents were UK immigrants from Guyana, formerly British Guiana. Accompanied by his mother Edna, he arrived in the UK from British Guiana on 18 April 1950 as a two year old infant. His father, Winston McKenzie, was a jazz bass player. His sister, Candy McKenzie, went on to have a successful music career as a backing singer and recorded with a number of artistes including Bob Marley, Leonard Cohen, Whitney Houston and Diana Ross. Career In late 1966, McKenzie joined Hughie Flint as a member Alexis Korner's short lived band Free At Last, replacing Cliff Barton on bass guitar. On 31 January 1967, at Philips Studios, Marble Arch, London the trio recorded ‚ÄòRosie‚Äô. It was released as a single on the Fontana record label in April 1967 (TF 817). Flint remembered McKenzie as \\"an amazing guy, very young and undisciplined\\". In the mid 1960s, McKenzie became friends with John McLaughlin. In January 1967, they played together on the Duffy Power composition \\"Just Stay Blue\\". McLaughlin recommended McKenzie to Miles Davis due to his bass playing abilities. McLaughlin composed the jazz blues number \\"Binky's Beam\\" as a tribute to McKenzie. It has an unusual 15/8 time signature and featured on McLaughlin's 1969 album Extrapolation. McLaughlin states in the liner notes ‚Äúthis is dedicated to Binky McKenzie, one of the greatest bass players.\\" During this period McKenzie was dating Anne Fraser, sister of Andy Fraser who went on to become the bass player and songwriter with the group Free. McKenzie would often visit the Fraser's home in Horndean Close, Roehampton, London. Fraser would leave his own bass guitar lying around the house in the hope that McKenzie would pick it up and play. Fraser always maintained that Binky McKenzie had a significant influence on his own bass playing. In November 2014, Andy Fraser said of McKenzie: ‚ÄúHe was an incredible bass player. And when I say incredible, I mean incredible. He was like the next Jimi Hendrix on bass. But he had some kind of chip on his shoulder and drugs seemed to make it worse. I would listen to him (at home) from the other room and learn all I could, absorb every little thing. He was literally a genius and he was playing with people like Alexis Korner, taking over from Jack Bruce, and he was like, wow, this guy is something else. His younger brother played guitar and both of them introduced me to lots of other musicians in their area, North London‚Äù McKenzie also recorded sessions with Pete Brown during August 1967 and January 1968. These recordings are held in the archives at the British Library and include an early version of the track \\"Politician\\" which subsequently appeared on the Cream album, Wheels of Fire. Brown later recalled: ‚ÄúI thought he was way ahead of his time. He had a bit of a chip on his shoulder, because at the time, black musicians had a hard time of it. The openings were so few, it didn‚Äôt matter how good you were. But he was such an innovator on the bass. Binky did drugs. Not much, just personal use. But his parents got very heavy about it and called the police in (during 1968) and Binky did time. When he came out of the ‚Äònick‚Äô (prison), he was one very, very angry young man indeed.‚Äù In 1969 McLaughlin also referred to this initial period of incarceration in the liner notes to ‚ÄòExtrapolation‚Äô, saying at the time he felt that Binky had been ‚Äúunjustly jailed with his brother Bunny‚Äù. Siege at Olive Road On Thursday 29 July 1971 at the family home in Cricklewood, North West London, McKenzie went on a violent rampage. He killed his mother Edna, father Winston, and brother-in-law Richard Sims. All victims were stabbed multiple times. His younger sister Candy was also stabbed and seriously injured but survived the attack. Shortly after the killing spree the house was surrounded by armed police. McKenzie barricaded himself inside the bathroom using a variety of items including a wardrobe and two double basses. A siege ensued lasting four-and-a-half hours. A police marksman went into the attic with a CS gas gun. He bored a hole through the bathroom ceiling and fired a CS gas shell into the room. McKenzie immediately rushed out on to the landing holding a knife in each hand. Four policemen struggled to overpower him. He was eventually restrained injuring a policeman in the process. Sentence At the Old Bailey in March 1972, McKenzie was found guilty on three counts of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He was detained at Broadmoor. McKenzie was 24 years old at the time of the sentence.

The region, on the East Coast of New Zealand's North Island, has many culturally and historically significant sites that relate to early MƒÅori exploration in the 14th century and important colonial events, such as Captain Cook's first landfall in New Zealand. First arrivals For over seven centuries the Gisborne Region has been inhabited by the tribes of Te Aitanga- a-MƒÅhaki, Rongowhakaata, NgƒÅi TƒÅmanuhiri, NgƒÅti Porou and Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti. According to MƒÅori tradition, these iwi descended from 3 main groups of migrants, the crews of the Te Ikaroa-a-Rauru, Horouta and TƒÅkitimu waka, which were part of a larger seven-canoe migration from Hawaiki around 1350 AD. MƒÅui and Paikea The NgƒÅti Porou iwi of the East Cape cite the god-like figure MƒÅui as being fundamental to their history. It is said that he is the ancestor who binds NgƒÅti Porou descendants to the beginnings of human existence. MƒÅui's canoe Nukutaimemeha is the most ancient waka associated with the region. In it he is said to have fished up the North Island from the bottom of the ocean. According to tribal tradition, Nukutaimemeha now lies upturned in stone on Mt Hikurangi, another significant cultural icon. NgƒÅti Porou derive their name from their ancestor Porourangi, a descendant of MƒÅui. Porourangi's wife, Hamoterangi, migrated on Te Ikaroa a Rauru waka which belonged to MƒÅia, brother-in-law of Uenuku, who bought with him precious gourd seeds. Te Ikaroa a Rauru came ashore on the Kaiti side of the Turanganui River, close to Tuamotu, and the crew occupied this area as well as the banks of the Taruheru stream. MƒÅia lived at the Puhi Kaiti pƒÅ. Paikea is also a key ancestor in East Coast history who is said to have come from Hawaiki on the back of a whale. Traditions recount how, on his journey to New Zealand, Paikea's canoe sunk and his brothers drowned. After calling upon the guardians of the sea to help him, a taniwha in the form of a whale came to his rescue and carried him to land at Ahuahu (Great Mercury Island). From here he went on to WhakatƒÅne, and eventually to Whangara on the East Coast. Horouta, Takitimu and Te Ikaroa-a-Rauru  Genealogical Table of Pawa and Kiwa of the Horouta Whilst it is generally accepted that the tribes of the East Coast descend from the voyagers of the three above mentioned waka, local oral traditions offer differing versions of account regarding their arrival in the region. The learned MƒÅoris of the past regarded their history as being exceedingly sacred, or tapu, and therefore imparting it to a stranger rendered it 'polluted' or 'common'. Being the most sacred canoe of all in the migration, the TƒÅkitimu's history was held strictly tapu. Subsequently, two versions of its story exist, one of the Northern East Coast which tells of the crew disembarking at Mahia, and the another of the Southern East Coast which maintains that the TƒÅkitimu landed at several places along the East Coast including ≈™awa (Tolaga Bay) and Turanganui (Gisborne). In one account, the great navigator Kiwa was the commander aboard the TƒÅkitimu canoe which made the first landfall in the region from Hawaiki. In this version, PƒÅoa (or Pawa), captain of the waka Horouta, is said to have followed later. However, another widely accepted version of events is that Horouta preceded TƒÅkitimu (possibly by as much as 100 years) with both PƒÅoa and Kiwa aboard, and that Tamatea was commander of TƒÅkitimu. In 1931, Sir ƒÄpirana Ngata maintained in an address to the Tairawhiti Maori Association that Horouta was in fact the main canoe that brought the people to the East Coast, not the Takitimu, and that NgƒÅti Porou had always regarded TƒÅkitimu as \\"an unimportant canoe\\". MƒÅori historian Rongowhakaata Halbert also affirmed this in his book 'Horouta' (1999). Originally, the great Polynesian explorer Toi had given the Horouta to Kahukura so he could retrieve k≈´mara from Hawaiki. After retrieving the vegetables, Horouta returned to New Zealand with PƒÅoa as her commander and Kiwa her priest. The canoe first made landfall at Ahuahu, followed by the Bay of Plenty and Te Muriwai, where PƒÅoa's sister Hinehakirirangi disembarked and decided to stay. Horouta then continued across the bay around until it came ashore on the west bank of the Turanganui River. Kiwa was first to set foot on land (either as the new commander of a skeleton crew, or because it was customary for a priest to do so), and thus named the land \\"T≈´ranganui-a-Kiwa\\" (The great standing place of Kiwa). Many place-names were left by the Horouta crew including the Waipaoa River, Te Kurƒ´-o-PƒÅoa (Young Nick's Head), and Te Tuahenitanga-a-Pawa (Tuahine Point). Early History (c. 1350 ‚Äì 1900) MƒÅori Settlement During the fourteenth century, MƒÅori tribes built fishing villages close to the sea and built pƒÅ on nearby hilltops. In fifteenth century, Ruapani, a descendant of PƒÅoa and Kiwa, became paramount chief of the T≈´ranga tribes. He had a great pƒÅ, known as Popoia, on the western bank of the WaipƒÅoa River at Waituhi. Ruapani had three wives who between them bore 25 children. Many prominent MƒÅori leaders descend from Ruapani including Te Kani-a-Takirau, the Te Heuheu dynasty of NgƒÅti Tuwharetoa, Te Rauparaha, Hƒìnare Tomoana, Te Kooti, Wi Pere, Sir James Carroll, Sir MƒÅui P≈çmare and Sir ƒÄpirana Ngata. Several major conflicts occurred in the region between neighbouring tribes over the following centuries, which led to the spread of influence of Porourangi's descendants.  Captain Cook landing On 8 October 1769, Captain James Cook made his historic first landing in New Zealand upon the Endeavour at Gisborne's Kaiti Beach. Cook had earlier set off from Plymouth, England in August 1768 on a mission bound for Tahiti. Once he had concluded his duties in Tahiti, Cook continued south to look for a large landmass or continent. Young Nick's Head was thought to be the first piece of New Zealand land sighted by Cook's party, and so named because it was first observed by cabin boy Nicholas Young on October 6. On October 9, Cook came ashore on the eastern bank of the T≈´ranganui River, accompanied by a party of men. Their arrival was marred by misunderstanding and resulted in the death and wounding of nine Maori over four days. Cook dubbed the place Poverty Bay because \\"it afforded us no one thing we wanted.\\" Before leaving the region, the Endeavour visited Anaura and Tolaga bays where they had more positive interactions with MƒÅori. Cook's landing site on Kaiti Beach was commemorated by a monument in 1906, on the 137th anniversary of Cook's arrival. In 1964 the Gisborne committee of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust registered the land around the monument as a historic reserve, and in 1990 it was designated a National Historic Reserve and put under the care of the Department of Conservation. Musket wars With the arrival of European whaling and trading ships in the early 1800s, the northern tribes of Ngapuhi and Ngati Whatua were able to trade flax, potatoes, fruit and pigs for muskets. As muskets were made more readily available, intertribal warfare intensified, as did Kaitangata (cannibalism), slavery and the pursuit of utu (revenge). During this time the East Coast region was decimated by the northern tribes, as NgƒÅpuhi chiefs P≈çmare and Te Wera Hauraki waged a number of battles against local iwi. Most notable was the 1820 massacre of Ngati Porou hapu by P≈çmare's war party during a six-month siege in Te Whetumatarau pa at Te Araroa. European settlement and town growth The East Coast sheet of the Treaty of Waitangi, signed by 24 T≈´ranga chiefs European settlement didn't begin in the Gisborne Region (or T≈´ranga as it was then known) until the early 1830s when traders such as Captain John Harris and Captain George E. Read set up the first trading stations along the T≈´ranganui River. The Anglican Church became a strong influence in many MƒÅori communities during this time as the Church Missionary Society extended its reach to the East Cape. In 1840 William Williams, a missionary and linguist, established a mission station in T≈´ranga. Over the next 30 years, many more European traders and missionaries migrated to the region where flax, muskets, blankets, tobacco were the main products of trade. In May 1840, 24 chiefs from the T≈´ranga district signed the Treaty of Waitangi. Land was then sold or leased, and more systematic European settlement of the area began. The MƒÅori people of T≈´ranganui-a-Kiwa made the most of business and trading opportunities with some hap≈´ beginning to ship produce long-distance to a prospering Auckland. Conflict of the 1860s During the early 1860s conflict had broken out between MƒÅori and the government over ownership of land and authority. Initially few people of the T≈´ranganui-a-Kiwa tribes were drawn into these wars, however attitudes changed when the government began to confiscate MƒÅori land. As the Pai MƒÅrire (Hauhau) religious movement spread their anti- colonisation ideology into the Poverty Bay region, infighting broke out in Ngati Porou and the iwi was split into two factions, the Hauhau converts and those who stood to resist their invasion. Hauhau sought to drive PƒÅkehƒÅ from MƒÅori land and gain support for Kƒ´ngitanga, the movement to create a MƒÅori nation under a MƒÅori king. Major conflict erupted on the East Coast when government forces and those of Ngati Porou who had pledged allegiance to the crown sought to drive Hauhau from pƒÅ sites in the region. The most noted leaders who rose against the Hauhau forces in NgƒÅti Porou land were RƒÅpata Wahawaha, H≈çtene Porourangi, Tuta Nihohiho, Hƒìnare P≈çtae and M≈çkena K≈çhere. Internal conflicts followed in a number of places from northern Waiapu to Tokomaru Bay, Tolaga Bay, and T≈´ranganui‚ÄìWaerenga-a-hika. They ended in the pursuit of Te Kooti through the Urewera in 1870. 20th century The end of the 19th century marked an end to conflict and the beginning of flourishing trade opportunities along the coast. A thriving pastoral hinterland and two new freezing works boosted development and as a result many other industries were established. William Gisborne, who the town is named after, circa 1895 In 1868 the government bought 300 hectares of land in T≈´ranga for a town site. The town was laid out in 1870 and the name changed from T≈´ranga to Gisborne, after the then colonial secretary William Gisborne, and to avoid confusion with Tauranga. In 1872, Gisborne's first public school was opened and its first newspaper, the Poverty Bay Standard was established. A town council was formed in 1877. From the 1890s onwards, Ngati Porou leader ƒÄpirana Ngata, rose to prominence as a political leader and staunch advocate for MƒÅori development on the East Coast. His leadership helped revitalise the MƒÅori population and morale through administration of farm land, cultural revival in the arts and literature, and promotion of sports. Ngata helped to organise MƒÅori participation in both world wars and is remembered as the 'father of the MƒÅori Battalion'. View over Gisborne in the 1920s ATLIB 291659 By 1926 the population of Gisborne had risen to 15,000, although it was overwhelmingly PƒÅkehƒÅ (European) ‚Äì fewer than 2% of the population were MƒÅori. However, the opening of a new meeting house at Te Poho-o-RƒÅwiri marae in 1930 was a major public event that bought many MƒÅori to the area. By that time Gisborne had developed into a provincial capital with an improved harbour, a post office, a high school and a flourishing main street (Gladstone Road). Homes were built along the banks of the Taruheru River, along with a botanical garden. Pastoral farming continued to thrive during the 1950s and 1960s. The port was complemented by a rail link and an airport, and a food-processing and canning industry developed. Gisborne attained city status on August 8, 1955 with a population of 20,000. From the second half of the 20th century, the Gisborne region began to grow as a major centre of MƒÅori culture. While in 1961 the MƒÅori population in the area was just under 12% of the total, by 2013 it had increased to 49%, the highest proportion of any regional population. The 2013 New Zealand census revealed that over 30% of MƒÅori residents in Gisborne speak te reo MƒÅori. In March 1988 Cyclone Bola hit Gisborne and the East Cape, bringing torrential rain that flooded the area for more than three days and caused significant damage to homes and farm land, costing the horticulture industry an estimated $90 million. Three people died and thousands were evacuated from their homes. Cyclone Bola resulted in a government repair bill of more than $111 million. Due to its proximity to the international dateline, Gisborne has long regarded itself as the first city in the world to see the sun rise each day. Over the 1999/2000 new year, Gisborne hosted major celebrations as the world's first major settlement to witness the dawn of the new millennium. The festivities, which included a performance by opera singer Kiri te Kanawa, were broadcast to television audiences worldwide.

It was founded in 2015 and is a Mexico National Institute for Entrepreneurship- certified incubator that has developed and housed 100 high-growth technology companies. History Foundation Technology Hub was founded in 2015 with the mission of enhancing the entrepreneurial and startup climate of the El Paso‚ÄìJu√°rez region. The organization is headquartered in Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico and has an office in El Paso, Texas. The redesigned former US consulate, now functioning as the headquarters of Technology Hub Ju√°rez. In the long term, Technology Hub is working to move the city's low skill manufacturing industry into an innovation cluster. 60 percent of the jobs in Ciudad Ju√°rez are located at its more than 300 foreign assembly plants, and most of them are low-wage and low-skill positions. In 2016 Ciudad Ju√°rez was found to have some of the lowest formal employment wages in Mexico. Technology Hub's economic development projects look to change these statistics through training and enablement programs, taking the suggestion of accredited Stanford research that concludes ‚Äú‚Ä¶highly specialized innovation workers, such as engineers and designers, generate about three times as many local jobs for service workers ‚Äî such as doctors, carpenters, and waitresses ‚Äî as do manufacturing workers\\". Facility Coworking space in Technology Hub's facility which is made available to local companies and startups. The operation is centered around the redesigned, refurbished former US consulate facility in Ciudad Ju√°rez. The 1.8 acre compound was designed to promote successful enterprises by creators, students, and industry entrepreneurs in the region. The State of Chihuahua Innovation and Economic Development Secretary Alejandra de la Vega moved the government agency's headquarters from the state capital into Technology Hub's facility in 2016. Programs Steve Jobs auditorium, where many of Technology Hub's programs are held. Offering technical training, networking, and mentoring programs, Technology Hub houses a 3D printing Fab lab, a virtual reality demonstration development facility, and regularly hosts bi-national tech events such as startup weekends, hackathons, Shark Tank-esque pitch contests, and women in STEM workshops. In 2017 and 2018,Technology Hub hosted RESET, the largest bi-national entrepreneurial event along the Mexico-US border. More than 3,500 university students attended the event to see industry figures from Amazon, MIT, National Geographic, NASA, and Marvel Comics, among others. Technology Hub works collaboratively with companies operating in Ciudad Ju√°rez on programs for data mining, human capital development, and other industry topics. Technology Hub has also worked with financial backer Microsoft on the latter's TechSpark initiative and to deliver the RESET program. The Bridge Accelerator The Bridge Accelerator is a bi-national supplier development program in the El Paso‚ÄìJu√°rez region implemented by Technology Hub and its U.S.-based sister organization Pioneers21. It was launched in the spring of 2019 with the aim of improving local SME participation in the regional 39 billion-dollar supply chain, where only 2 percent of the manufacturing inputs currently come from local El Paso or Ju√°rez suppliers. The program consists of twelve weeks of company training on topics including IT and data analytics, and is designed to create advantageous connections between entrepreneurs and corporations. Program workshops are held on both sides of the border, at Technology Hub Ju√°rez and at an incubator in El Paso. Six Mexican and six American companies take part in each Bridge Accelerator cohort, with the program scheduled to run twice a year through 2022. Participating companies are required to be in business for at least two years and must be based in the region. Program results and collaboration with Microsoft The Bridge Accelerator pilot program in 2019 worked with 11 local businesses from El Paso and Ciudad Ju√°rez, creating 33 new jobs and receiving 52 purchase orders worth $1.48 million. Following the results of the pilot, President Brad Smith of Microsoft announced a $1.5 million investment to extend The Bridge Accelerator for another 3 years through the Microsoft TechSpark program in El Paso-Ju√°rez, labeling it their ‚Äòsignature project‚Äô in the region. The Bridge program plans to use this funding to train 75 companies in six cohorts over the next three years, with the goal of these companies receiving least $7.5 million in new purchase orders and creating 200 new jobs. A second Bridge Accelerator cohort ran in the spring of 2020. Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, The Bridge Accelerator program was moved entirely online starting in March, but still finished with a virtual-attendance Demo Day event on June 26, 2020. The Bridge Accelerator is sponsored and supported by many other large organizations invested in the El Paso-Ju√°rez region.

In 1964, after taking additional education courses at the University of Chicago, he earned a BFA, followed by an MFA in 1968. During this time, he discovered Dr. Hans Prinzhorn's 1922 book, Artistry of the Mentally Ill‚Äîa key influence on Jean Dubuffet's Art Brut‚Äîwhich inspired Lamantia through its emphasis on the unconscious, hallucinations, and interior reality. Lamantia became known for his complex, obsessive drawings through group exhibitions at the Hyde Park Art Center, Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (MCA), and Art Institute. In 1972, Jean Dubuffet took notice of Lamantia's work, eventually exchanging work with him and hosting him in Paris. In subsequent years, Lamantia showed in regular solo exhibitions at Zaks Gallery (1977‚Äì2000), and was featured in prominent shows at the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1975), School of the Art Institute (\\"Visions\\", 1976), Crocker Art Museum (\\"The Chicago Connection\\", 1976‚Äì7, traveling), Smithsonian Institution (\\"Chicago Currents,\\" 1979‚Äì80, traveling),Smithsonian Institution.

By the early 1970s, critics suggested that his more controlled and deliberately composed paintings had caught up in terms of freedom of invention and integration of feeling and execution. In monumental works, he depicted surreal, ambiguously-sexed figures and groups‚Äîsirens, buxom temptresses, leather-clad dominatrixes, voyeurs, and mutant beasts‚Äîundergoing dizzying transformations into giant insects, plant-like forms and horrific organic conglomerations, while engaged in discomfiting, sometimes predatory sexual dramas.Adrian, Dennis. \\"Socko and subtle.

In these paintings, faces, skin, sinuous legs, torpedo breasts, muscles and organs blend or morph into invented anatomies of snapping jaws, sprouting eyes, bird beaks, claws, tentacles and machine, while skin, makeup, masking, tattooing, scarring and costuming become indistinguishable, rendering interpretation compellingly ambiguous, for many critics.

Lamantia set his scenes in garish, compressed domestic interiors that recall the harrowing rooms of Francis Bacon and Max Beckmann.Artner, Alan G. Review, Chicago Tribune, April 10, 1981, Section 2, p. 13. Critics described the work as a tangle of bewildering abstract patterns, high-key color, frenzied line and strong contour, with contradictory forms that lacked a focal point or orientation to distinguish figure from ground.Adrian, Dennis. \\"Paul Lamantia,\\" Visions, Painting and Sculpture: Distinguished Alumni 1945 to the Present, Catalogue, Chicago: The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, 1976, p. 100-1. Simultaneously, they noted a clear level of formal structural integrity deriving from what Franz Schulze called Lamantia's \\"controlled wildness\\" and his absorption of classical genre compositions of female nudes in interiors from Titian to Matisse. Paul Lamantia, The Collector of Unfulfilled Dreams, oil on canvas, 55\\" x 49\\", 2010. In the 1980s, critics observed that Lamantia's paintings, while thematically as unnerving as ever, became leaner, more painterly and open, and reminiscent of Willem de Kooning's savage \\"Woman\\" paintings.Artner, Alan G. \\"Lamantia still tilts with towers of strength,\\" Chicago Tribune, November 14, 1986. Works from Whisper (1980) to Blood Love (1993) featured a subdued, finessed palette of whites, light yellows, pastels and deep purples, that enhanced the rhythms of streamlined, Baroque compositions employing illusionistic, theatrical space. Alan Artner compared the technique to Bacon's appropriation of Monet-like painterliness in his disquieting works; Buzz Spector felt this joy in painting offset a potentially moralistic tone in the work.Spector, Buzz. \\"Paul Lamantia,\\" Artforum, January 1987. Lamantia's figuration also evolved towards an H.P. Lovecraftian, sci-fi- like \\"mechano-morphism,\\" with \\"metallic musculature suggesting malevolent sexual machinery\\" merging with his existing re-grafted mutations. Lamantia's paintings from the later 1990s onward returned to the more claustrophobic compositions of earlier work, incorporating the linear freedom of his drawings, but in a \\"less manic and tortured\\" form that critics described as \\"an amiable kind of chaos.\\"Miller, Chris. \\"Review: Subconscious Eye/Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art,\\" New City, May 21, 2013. Retrieved October 30, 2018. James Yood called the work a \\"strangely hypnotic\\" catalogue of unmediated male desire \\"immersed in sheer pictorial thrill.\\" He suggested that Lamantia's uncensored, possibly confessional frankness about contradictory aspects of desire in works such as Still Lives (1995) elevated what might seem retrograde or misogynist, much like Picasso's 1920s‚Äì1930s work. Late paintings, such as The Solution (2010) or The Collector of Unfulfilled Dreams (2012)‚ÄîLamantia's \\"unnerving reworking of the Garden of Eden story\\"‚Äîfeature a greater emphasis on the materiality of paint, the expressive possibilities of gestural accident, and flirtation with abstraction. Drawing In the 1960s, Lamantia attracted notice for drawings packed with sprawling comic- and Mir√≥- like forms and explosive energy, that some compared to the fantasy-scapes of Roberto Matta or Hieronymous Bosch. Working in ball-point and felt-tip pen, pastel, gouache, collage, color pencil and crayons, he produced frenzied, intricate work that was unstable in its emotion and forms, and suggested a spontaneity that critics said was belied by its technical richness and finesse. Robert Cozzolino called works of the time, such as Like Father Like Son (1968), \\"extraordinarily raw and vulnerable\\" treatments of family, identity and emotional states, that portrayed the angst of the period and its \\"the-personal-is-the-political\\" ethos.Cozzolino, Robert. \\"Excellence on Paper from Colonial to Contemporary, No. 7.: Like Father Like Son by Paul Lamantia,\\" Drawing Magazine.

Works on Paper. Retrieved October 30, 2018. Cozzolino, and others, consider the drawings to be among the least well-known, understudied bodies of work among artists of Lamantia's generation. John Corbett, nonetheless, suggests that this work built \\"a historical bridge between the rough-hewn feel of earlier Monster Roster artists and the sleek, cartoonish gleam of later Imagist work.\\" Lamantia's drawing has continued apace his painting in subsequent decades, including some monochromatic drawings in the 1970s, such as Your Favorite Sores Bronze Plated in Raw Meat and The Vendor of His Scars (Art Institute of Chicago collection), both from 1977. In the catalogue to Lamantia's 2016 retrospective, Margaret Hawkins described late drawings, such as Oddball Losers (2000) and Peep Freak (2001), as gorgeous explorations of \\"infinite inner space\\" that flow \\"directly from the subconscious\\" and teem with provocative sensory information Since 2014, Lamantia has started painting on frozen pizza boxes, leaving portions of the color food photography to peek through and morph into skin and eyes; these works share an affinity with 16th-century Mannerist Giuseppe Arcimboldo's \\"whimsically grotesque portraits.\\" In addition to his drawings, Lamantia has also created prints at Anchor Press in Chicago and Lakeside Press in Michigan.

Attributed to a calligrapher in the Ottoman Empire, the work depicts a galleon of the Ottoman navy. The ship is inscribed with the names of the Seven Sleepers, a group of men who were protected by the Abrahamic God, likely to confer a blessing of protection on the ship. It is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Description   Background  Calligraphy has had a long and storied history in the Islamic World. While the art form was most commonly reserved for writing or inscribing, some individual works of art were entirely made using calligraphy. Known as \\"calligrams\\", these images depicted a number of subjects. One such subject was ships, with calligrams of ships being especially popular in the Ottoman Empire. Some practitioners of Sufism attached a degree of mystical importance to these works of art, which were displayed inside of ritual spaces. A similar art- form‚ÄîPictorial Writing‚Äîwas also prevalent in Persia.Blair, Sheila S. Islamic Calligraphy. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006. pp. 449‚Äì56, 506‚Äì8, 558‚Äì59, ill. fig. 10.15.  Calligraphic Galleon  The Met's galleon is done in ink-and-gold on paper. The prominently displayed ship depicted by the calligram is a galleon, a large warship famously used by the Spanish and Portuguese empires during the Age of sail.Little, Benerson (2010). \\"Spanish Galleons and Portuguese Carracks\\". Pirate Hunting: The Fight Against Pirates, Privateers, and Sea Raiders from Antiquity to the Present. Washington, DC: Potomac. p. 145. . Due to the Ottoman navy frequently encountering the large Spanish ships in the Mediterranean, the empire's navy built a number of their own galleons to counter the Spanish threat. Thus, the Met's calligram was likely created in honor of the commissioning of new galleons into the Ottoman navy. An example of a similar calligram, depicting a 17th-century oared ship, is in the collection of the Topkapƒ± Palace Museum in Istanbul, Turkey.Ekhtiar, Maryam, Sheila R. Canby, Navina Haidar, and Priscilla P. Soucek, ed. Masterpieces from the Department of Islamic Art in The Metropolitan Museum of Art. 1st ed. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2011. no. 206, pp. 296‚Äì97, ill. p. 297. The calligram's creator inscribed characters representing the story of the Seven Sleepers (the Ashab al-Kahf in Arabic), a group of seven men who were given refuge in a cave by God, onto the galleon; it has been posited that such an inscription on the work was intended to protect the ship from harm, just as God protected the seven sleepers. In addition, the Ottoman navy was dedicated to the Seven Sleepers, all of whom's names can be seen on the galleon's hull and deck.

He was notable for writing Jewish devotional works and religious text books. Early life and education Emanuel Hecht was born in 1821 in Nordheim (now Nordheim am Main), Germany. In 1842 Hecht graduated from the Royal Training College for Teachers in W√ºrzburg. After the district government of Lower Franconia appointed Hecht instructor of admission candidates of that school, Hecht relinquished the position, devoting himself to teaching Jewish youth. Career Hecht went on to publish many essays during his three years of service in a Lower Franconian small community. These essays were published in Jewish periodicals, Jewish schools via Biblical history books and in a Hebrew primer. In 1842 Hecht wrote Biblische Gesch and Handb√ºchlein f√ºr Lesesch√ºler des Hebr√§ischen. David Einhorn invited Hecht to Hoppst√§dten in 1845 to serve as a Jewish communal school teacher which Hecht accepted. About a decade later, Hecht wrote Israel's Gesch. von der Zeit des Bibelabschlusses bis zur Gegenwart. The book was about the Israelites' history from Alexander's time through when the book was written. In 1856, Hecht campaigned vigorously for and was awarded full recognition by Birkenfeld's Jewish communal schools making them equal to their Christian counterparts. This was in conjunction with David Einhorn's successor being promoted in the provincial office. Hecht was elected provincial council member two years later. That same year Hecht published a short lived religious journal in 1858 titled \\"Der Israelitische Haus- und Schulfreund,\\" along with his Versuch das Hebr√§ische Durch Deutsche W√∂rter zu Erlernen work. 1859 was a busy year for Hecht as he authored three writings: Die Hebr√§ische Vorschule, Der Uebersetzungslehrer and Kleine Hebr√§ische Grammatik in addition to him also being on trial before the provincial court. He was charged with reviling the state religion in his Unterscheidungslehre Zwischen Juden- und Christenthum publication. writing, but he was fully exonerated. Some of Hecht's subsequent works after his exoneration included Das Judenthum: ein Religionsbuch f√ºr H√∂here Schulen and Liederbuch f√ºr Israelitische Schulen in 1860. Hecht's last writing was Der Pentateuch in Lehrreichen und Erbaulichen Betrachtungen, Erz√§hlungen und Gedichten in 1862 shortly before his death. Some of Hecht's historical and pedagogical studies that he published were a monograph on the Jews of Treves (Trier) along with Der Vors√§ngerdienst der Israeliten nach Seiner Gesetzlichen Entwickelung (which was described as a pamphlet).

He is known for writing several popular series of children's books and is a former staff writer for Hallmark greeting cards. In 2018 Barnes received several awards that include the Newbery Honor and Coretta Scott King Award for his 2017 book Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut. Barnes' books celebrate African American culture and feature positive images of black children in everyday life.  Career  Barnes began his writing career in 1999 as the first full-time black male copywriter for Hallmark. In 2003, he left Hallmark and moved to New Orleans, where he worked a variety of jobs before signing a multi-book deal with children's book publisher Scholastic. In 2011, Barnes began working part-time in the Kansas City Public Library's outreach department. As part of the library's \\"Stories to Go\\" program, Barnes was hired to travel to sites such as schools, daycares, and churches reading to children, and share stories with them.  Books  In 2004, Scholastic published his books The Low-down, Bad-day Blues, and Stop, Drop, and Chill. Barnes' first young adult book, The Making of Dr. Truelove, was published in 2008. The story, about a 16-year-old boy and his pursuit of the girl of his dreams, revolves around relationships and sexuality, and the book was ranked as one of the top 100 books for teens by the New York Public Library.Fuller M. Derrick Barnes. Critical Survey of Children‚Äôs Literature: Biographies. July 2017:1-2. Accessed November 1, 2018.  Ruby and the Booker Boys  Barnes' popular series of books entitled Ruby and the Booker Boys covers the story of Ruby Booker, a sassy third grader trying to make a name for herself in the shadow of her three older brothers. The series started with two books published simultaneously in 2008, Brand New School, Brave New Ruby and Trivia Queen, 3rd Grade Supreme. The sequel The Slumber Party Payback was released the same year, and Ruby Flips For Attention was released in 2009. Critical reviews of the series highlighted Barnes' ability to create positive stories for young readers. Critical Survey of Children's Literature wrote, \\"The warm and gentle themes and images of the Ruby series‚Äîa loving family, quirky but confident children, a vibrant sense of community spirit, a joy in diversity‚Äîprovide a literary reflection of an African American reality not often represented in children‚Äôs literature or popular culture.\\"  We Could Be Brothers  We Could Be Brothers, a hardcover novel written for young teenagers, tells the story of two middle-grade boys with two different upbringings who both attend the same school. The book explores coming-of-age themes, including race, self-respect, women, and what it means to grow up as a black kid in American society. It was published by Scholastic in 2010. Critics praised its story line and its focus on the themes of friendship and community.  Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut  Barnes' first picture book, Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut, illustrated by Gordon C. James, was published in 2017 to critical acclaim. The story is about a young black boy and his experience getting a haircut in a barbershop. It explores aspects of African American culture, and celebrates themes of self-confidence and pride. Crown was well received, featuring at the 2018 ALA Youth Media Awards and winning several awards including a 2018 Newbery Honor (for content), a Caldecott Honor (for illustrations), a Coretta Scott King Award (for both author and illustrator), the Ezra Jack Keats Book Award (writer and illustrator), and the $50,000 Kirkus Prize.  The King of Kindergarten  The picture book The King of Kindergarten illustrated by Vanessa Brantley-Newton was released in July 2019.  Influences  Barnes has identified Stevie Wonder and Langston Hughes as influences, saying that \\"Hughes and his Simple short-story series helped him learn about dialogue and character development, while the liner notes of Wonder's albums inspired Barnes to manipulate language the way the songsmith did to add rhythm to his writing style. He recounts reading the liner notes as a seven-year-old child, enthralled by the language.\\" In an interview with The Kansas City Star, Barnes explained that there aren't enough books about kids of color by people of color. \\"I want to leave behind a body of work my children can be proud of, but I also want to change how children see themselves in this world. I want to thwart those negative images and make sure they know they are loved.\\"  Personal life  Barnes grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, reading many picture books from a young age. Barnes graduated from Jackson State University with a degree in Marketing. Barnes, his wife Dr. Tinka Barnes, and their four sons currently reside in Charlotte, North Carolina.

As an anti-slavery activist, he was a founding member of the Republican Party and was honored by calling to order the first official Republican party meeting, which was held in Jackson with over 1500 people in attendance. He later represented Michigan as a delegate to the first national Republican meeting in 1856. McNaughton served in the Michigan Senate in 1853 on the Free Soil ticket, which was organized to stop slavery. McNaughton also served as Mayor of Jackson from 1866-1867. Having held many public trust positions, he was considered to be influential in the building of the state of Michigan.  Early Life, Education, and Marriage  The youngest of 11 children, McNaughton was born in Argyle, New York in 1813 to Robert and Isabella McNaughton. Both of his parents were of Scottish ancestry. McNaughton was the great grandson of Alexander McNaughton who helped found Argyle, NY, after immigrating to the United States in 1738. Alexander was credited with securing a large land tract with his fellow Scottish immigrants. McNaughton first attended Wyoming Academy. He went on to spend two years at Union College and later graduated from Fairfield Medical College in 1840. To start his medical career, McNaughton then moved to Jackson in 1841. He married his first wife Sarah Orcutt on July 1, 1835 in Wyoming, Genesee Co., NY. Sarah gave birth to twins, Moses and Hugh. Moses died as an infant and Sarah died shortly after child birth on June 25, 1836 at the age of 23. McNaughton married his second wife, Mary Turner, on April 6, 1848. Mary and Moses went on to have four children together, including Charles, Robert, Archie and Mary Bell.  Medical Doctor and Notable Businessman  McNaughton spent 12 years in Jackson practicing as a medical doctor and then got involved in other business activities. For example, he secured a large amount of property north of I-94 along Cooper Street‚Äîthis was in addition to land he purchased in Rives Township. As a pioneer, he was the original owner of the land that the Jackson District Library‚Äôs Carnegie Branch is located upon. He was involved in building several key railroads in Michigan. In the 1860s, he was involved with the Michigan Air Line Railroad as a director and was the treasurer and investor of Grand River Valley Railroad. In addition to the active contributions to the development of land and rail around the Jackson area, he was also part owner of one gold mine and five silver mines. He was an officer of the Jackson Bonanza Mining Company. To honor the McNaughton clan, he secured a plot in the Oaks Cemetery and imported a 30-foot marble monument from Scotland.  Politics, Anti- Slavery Activism and Founding of the Republican Party  McNaughton was a recognized anti-slavery activist and was very involved in the anti-slavery movement. This included being present at an anti-slavery convention in Kalamazoo, Michigan on June 21, 1854 that led up to the first official Republican meeting that was held in Jackson on July 6, 1854. At the Kalamazoo convention, McNaughton was made President and temporary Chairman. He has been credited as one of the organizing members of the Republican Party. At the first official meeting of the Republican party, McNaughton was honored by calling this first meeting to order. Later, he was in attendance at the first national Republican meeting as one of fourteen Michigan delegates. Due to his business successes, McNaughton built a mansion that was located on a hilltop on W. Trail Street. It was later found to have tunnels that led away from the mansion. There have been reports that these tunnels were used in the Underground Railroad during the Civil War. Though, this has not been proven and some speculate that the tunnels were a part of a coal mine or a form of ventilation.  The Jackson Legend of Little Mary  McNaughton‚Äôs granddaughter was Mary McNaughton who was born in Jackson, MI. The story of Mary is considered one of Michigan‚Äôs top ghost stories and her grave is still regularly visited by locals. However, the Jackson legend and the events surrounding it have been strongly disputed by her youngest sibling (Donald McNaughton).

Its estuary is known as Bow Creek, and flows into the River Dart near Stoke Gabriel. The river rises on the slopes of Gripper's Hill on Dean Moor on Dartmoor. From the source it flows generally south east, under the A38 road, to the village of Harberton. There it turns south, then east through Harbertonford to the hamlet of Bow near Ashprington. Below Bow the river is tidal, and becomes Bow Creek. Two miles below Bow, the estuary joins the Dart. The hamlet of Tuckenhay lies on the south bank of Bow Creek. There was a history of milling on the river. From the late 18th century there was a woollen mill at Harbertonford, fed by a leat from a weir upstream of the village. Until flood defence works were completed in 2002, the river caused periodic flooding at Harbertonford. The river gives its name to Harbourne Blue, a goat's cheese made near Ashprington.

The structures were built by the Holkars as cenotaphs to house the remains of the dynasty's rulers, leading to them also being known as the Holkar Chhatris. All three of the Chhatris are located half a kilometer from the palace-city of Rajwada, which was also built by the Holkar dynasty.  Description   History  The powerful family that built the chhatris, the Holkars, were originally a minor clan within the Maratha empire. They belonged to the Dhangar caste, which originated in Maharashtra. While in Maratha service, the Holkars fought against the Mughal empire and the British East India Company. However, following the Third Anglo- Maratha War and the subsequent collapse of the Maratha empire in 1818, the Holkars agreed to establish a protectorate on behalf of the East India Company in Indore. This diplomatic move established the Holkar dynasty, which ruled Indore until Indian Independence in 1948. The Krishnapura Chhatri themselves were built in the mid 19th century to honor the deceased members of the Holkar dynasty. They are named for Krishna Bai Holkar, the wife of famed military leader Yashwantrao Holkar and the mother of Malhar Rao Holkar II. The structures are built over the spot where the rulers of Indore were cremated.  Complex  Interior of the chhatri complex The complex contains three chhatris and five cenotaphs. Steps from the back of the site lead to the bank of the nearby Kahn river. The chhatris are made of several different types of stone, and feature elaborately carved exteriors and columns. The site around half a kilometer from Rajwada Palace. Due to the site's location within the city of Indore, parts of the complex have previously fallen into disrepair. As of 2018 efforts were being conducted to clean up the area. In 2018 the Madhya Pradesh Tourism Board announced that it would include the chhatris on a walking tour of the historic sites of Indore.

Early life Hanson was born in Orange, New South Wales, on 26 May 1914 and was educated at Christian Brothers College, Burwood. He worked as a manufacturing jeweller's assistant and a transit porter before joining the police force in 1936. He served in the Second World War with the Royal Australian Air Force from 1942 until 1946. He was rapidly promoted through the police ranks, becoming assistant commissioner in 1968 and deputy commissioner in early 1972. His nickname in the force was \\"Slippery\\". Career Hanson was promoted to commissioner on 15 November 1972, having been recommended for the role by his predecessor, Norman Allan, whose term had been tarnished by corruption allegations. Upon taking office, Hanson reportedly sacked 28 corrupt officers and announced that he saw drugs as the biggest problem facing police. As commissioner, Hanson reorganised the force structure, changed the police uniform, introduced Australia's first crime intelligence unit, and allowed women police officers to transfer to general duties for the first time. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in January 1974. He was occasionally referred to as a \\"playboy\\" for his personal habits while commissioner, and critics derided his term as undistinguished. As with his predecessor, issues of corruption and poor management continued throughout Hanson's term. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation settled a defamation action in 1976 after alleging the previous year that he held a financial interest in a gambling club; however, after his death in 1980 freed media to report without facing Australia's strict defamation laws, he faced repeated allegations of corruption, including having received money from illegal gambling interests and personal ties to various criminal figures. He retired early in 1976. Hanson sought successfully to have Mervyn Wood appointed as his successor; Wood, like Hanson and Allan, was dogged by corruption allegations and later unsuccessfully prosecuted. Hanson made an abortive campaign as an independent candidate for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Gosford at the 1978 election, but withdrew before election day. Bob Bottom would later allege that his campaign had been motivated by anger at the decision of Premier Neville Wran to order the closure of illegal casinos. Hanson died in his car in his garage in October 1980. The engine was not running when the body was found. It was initially reported as a heart attack, but later understood to be from carbon monoxide poisoning. The coroner decided not to hold an inquest.

Prehistorically this ophiolite was quarried by MƒÅori for both metasomatized argillite and pounamu (jade) which was used in the production of tools and jewellery. In the late 1800s, the Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt was surveyed for its economic potential. During this time the rock types dunite and rodingite (after Dun Mountain and the Roding River) were first named. Discovery of economic deposits of chromite near Nelson lead to the building of New Zealand‚Äôs first railway, however, extraction only occurred between 1862 and 1866. In the 20th century, serpentinite was mined for fertiliser and the ophiolite remains one of New Zealand's main sources of pounamu (jade), but all other mineral exploration has failed to find economic deposits.  Description  Maitai Group sediments folded into an isoclinal syncline The Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt is composed of a typical ophiolite sequence of ultramafic rocks overlain by a plutonic then volcanic sequence, and finally by conglomerates and other sedimentary rocks of the Maitai Group. The unaltered ultramafic rocks are restricted to three massifs, Dun Mountain, the Red Hills and Red Mountain, elsewhere they are highly serpentinized. This ophiolite sequence is structurally underlain by the ophiolitic Patuki M√©lange. The Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt likely formed in a forearc environment. *Mantle lithologies **Dun Mountain Ultramafics Group **Wairere Serpentinite **Upukerora M√©lange *Crustal igneous rocks **Otanomomo Complex **Livingstone Volcanics Group *Crustal sedimentary rock **Maitai Group ***Upukerora Breccia ***Wooded Peak Limestone *** Tramway Sandstone *** Greville Formation *** Little Ben Sandstone *** Stephens Subgroup *Basal m√©lange **Windon M√©lange **Paruki M√©lange  Distribution  Vegetation change from the Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt ultramafic rock (left) to mafic and sedimentary rock on the right. The Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt is a locally intact approximately section through oceanic crust. It is exposed between D'Urville Island in Marlborough District and St Arnaud in Tasman District, and Jackson Bay in the West Coast Region and Balclutha in Otago. The Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt is exposed in the South Island and is inferred to exist at depth under the North Island. It is in two sections, as it is offset by the Alpine Fault, with sections to the west of the fault having been displaced northwards.

He joined the Communist New Fourth Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and later fought in the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War. He was the first military commander to reach the disaster zone in Tangshan during the Great Tangshan earthquake of 1976.  Biography  Yao was born April 1925 in Dingyuan County, Anhui, China. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he enlisted in the New Fourth Army in March 1939, before turning 14. He joined the Communist Party of China in April 1942. He fought in many battles during the Sino-Japanese War and the ensuing Chinese Civil War, and steadily rose through the ranks. During the Korean War, Yao served as Commander of the 215th Regiment, 72nd Division, 24th Army of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. He was later promoted to Commander of the 197th Division, which was stationed in Tangshan, Hebei after 1969. During the Cultural Revolution, he served as Director of the Revolutionary Committee of the city of Qinhuangdao. In 1976, Yao was promoted to Chief of Staff of the 66th Army and stationed in nearby Tianjin. When the Great Tangshan earthquake occurred at 3 am, 28 July 1976, Yao was woken from sleep by violent shaking of the ground. Unsure where the epicenter of the quake was, he contacted all divisions of the 66th Army, but could not reach his own 197th Division. He set out with two soldiers and drove toward Tangshan. Because a major bridge was destroyed in the quake, they had to abandon the car and cross by boat, and did not reach Tangshan until 11 am. He was the first military leader to arrive in Tangshan, and led his soldiers in the rescue effort. However, most of the people they dug out were already dead, and they only occasionally found survivors under the rubble. Although Yao had fought in numerous battles in three wars, he described the Tangshan earthquake the most tragic experience in his life. Yao was appointed Commander of the 24th Group Army in 1983. He was also a member of the 6th National People's Congress. Yao died on 7 June 2018 in Tianjin, at the age of 93.

History Hill was a son of Rev. James Hill, an early missionary to India, where he was born. He worked for a time for Price's Candles in a management position, then around 1860 emigrated to South Australia, and opened a shop on Rundle Place in 1862 or earlier. He acted as an agent for several coastal ships, and sold bulk quantities of various goods including potatoes and wool packs. By 1880 he had a shop on Grenfell Street, and became the South Australian agent for Crossley gas engines. He was a member of the consortium that built the Stock Exchange on Pirie Street. Hill's sons were educated at John L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution and Prince Alfred College, and the two eldest were closely involved in the business. By 1889 he had moved to 18 Currie Street, where in addition to Crossley engines, he sold engineering tools, ovens, refrigeration plant and Ransomes' woodworking machines. By 1892 the business had become James Hill & Sons, and had further diversified to wholesale bicycle parts and accessories, but the Crossley engine remained a staple product. They also acted as residential rental agents. Hill died in 1901 and in 1902 his two elder sons moved the business to 63 Grenfell Street, and by 1903 were selling bicycles, Kelecom motor cycles, electric motors, marine engines, several models of Darracq motor cars, and Stevens Arms rifles. In 1914 they were selling Royal Enfield and Abingdon motorcycles and sidecars, and in 1915 first advertised Triumph motorcycles, though they had been agents for Triumph bicycles some 20 years. In another example of the firm's diversity they also stocked vacuum flasks and Duryea's \\"Maizena\\", an American cornflour.Townsend Duryea, the noted Adelaide photographer, was closely related to the owners of this company.

Dauylpaz (little) Dauylpaz (Big)  Description  Stamp released by the government of Kazakhstan in 2008. The image on the right depicts a dauylpaz The dauylpaz is an ancient, cauldron-shaped musical instrument. One end of the drum is an open space with taunt leather stretched across the larger, bowl shaped base. The instrument is played with a stick or mallet, and is worn on a belt. A nomadic people for much of their history, the Turkic Kazakh people occasionally fought among each other or against neighboring peoples. To communicate in battle, a multitude of signals were used, including drums. Drums also had an important role in Kazakh society, where they were used to signal an upcoming hunt, when the tribe was prepared to migrate, and in religious ceremonies. Overseen by shamans, such Kazakh religious ceremonies were held in order to celebrate births, deaths, marriages, and other events; dances and music made from a number of stringed or percussion instruments accompanied the rituals themselves. Certain instruments were used in certain rituals, with dauylpaz being used in rituals related to war or hunting. Notably, dauylpaz were used in a ritual dance (described as the \\"Kusbegi-dauylpaz\\", or \\"warrior-hunting bird\\") that entailed a warrior dancing with a hunting bird, as Kazakh hunters practiced falconry with eagles to hunt prey on the flat steppes of Central Asia. The Kazakh- Dzungar Wars (fought between 1643 and 1756) devastated several of the Central Asian peoples, including the Kazakhs. In the aftermath of the conflict, the expansion of the Russian Empire and Qing dynasty resulted in the decline of the Kazakh way of life, including the people's musical tradition. By the 20th century, the dauylpaz was reported to no longer be widely used by the Kazakh.

It was founded in response to the restrictions imposed by the Contraception, Sterlisation and Abortion Act (1977). SOS arranged for women from all parts of New Zealand to travel to Australian abortion clinics as well as helping to fund women's travel. By 1979 the law was interpreted more liberally reducing the need for the services of SOS.  History  The Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion Act (1977), passed into legislation on 15 December 1977, making New Zealand abortion law more restrictive and legal abortions virtually inaccessible. In early 1978 a feminist-launched petition called for parliament to repeal the 1977 act but it was not presented to parliament. In response to the law change groups of women banded together to form SOS. SOS provided counselling and support and made arrangements for women to travel to Australian clinics for safe, legal abortions. The Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch SOS groups were set up within days of the legislation being passed. The Auckland branch, began operation the day after the legislation was passed. It was initially run by volunteers but also had full-time staff: Joss Shawyer, Megan Grant and Sharyn Cederman. The Auckland office received up to 60 phone calls and 20 visits from women each day. One in 10 women needed help with money; as funds were low women were advised to try and raise the $510 needed. Elizabeth Sewell founded SOS in Christchurch. Sewell supervised 2 staff and 20 volunteers, organised publicity and personally counselled women. At its peak SOS in Christchurch received 20 calls a day from women seeking assistance. In Wellington an SOS branch formed on 20 December 1977. The local organiser was Leigh Minnitt, and she, Dr Carol Shand, Wendy Norman and a lawyer administered a trust which received donations from people wanting to help women ‚Äúleft in the lurch‚Äù. Margaret Sparrow and Leigh Minnitt organised telephone volunteers, billets for women requiring accommodation before flying to Australia, transport, flights, funds and phone calls to Australian clinics. On Easter Monday in 1978 (27 March 1978) the SOS office in New St, Auckland was destroyed in an arson attack. Broadsheet magazine listed SOS contacts. In June 1980 there were branches in the following places: Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin, Gisborne, Hamilton, Invercargill, Blenheim, Naper/Hastings, Nelson, New Plymouth, Palmerston North, Rotorua, Taupo, Tauranga, Whakatane, Wellington. By 1979 changes to the 1977 Act made it more workable and interpretation of the law was liberalised. Facilities offering abortions opened and by 1981 flights to Australia virtually ceased.  Achievements  The Auckland branch of SOS sent the first woman to Sydney on 21 December 1977, six days after the legislation was passed. The women had to pay their own airfares but SOS would meet the cost of the abortion itself which was about $120. SOS sent 177 women in January 1978 with 111 women booked for February. Figures gathered in January 1978 from the major clinics in Australia indicated that at least 16 New Zealand women a day were having abortions. Most women went to Sydney but others went to Melbourne and elsewhere. The ages of the women ranged from 14 to 45 and they came from all parts of New Zealand. By September 1978 some 1000 women had used the service. See Also *Abortion in New Zealand  External links  * Eyewitness: the Sisters Overseas Service and the 1977 Abortion Act on RNZ, 27 June 2019.

It was released on January 20, 2015, as the lead single from his debut solo album of the same name. A breakup ballad, the song's narrator describes the relationship with a former girlfriend and recollects his memories of the time they spent together. \\"One Fine Day\\" and its accompanying music video were simultaneously released. Filmed in Seoul, it was preceded by a teaser four days earlier. Jung performed the song on various weekly music chart shows, which earned him a total of four music show wins, including two consecutive awards on Korean Broadcasting System's (KBS) Music Bank. The song peaked at number three on South Korea's national Gaon Digital Chart and it shifted over 300,000 digital downloads by the end of the year. Background and composition \\"One Fine Day\\" was written by Jung, who contributed to its composition along with Two Face; the latter arranged the song. The track is a breakup ballad where the narrator recalls his former girlfriend and recollects his memories of their relationship, which he describes as \\"fine days\\". The track infuses \\"string and orchestral elements\\" in the song previously not found in CNBLUE's music. It is composed in the key of B-flat major using common time with a tempo of 71 beats per minute. Release and promotion A music video teaser for \\"One Fine Day\\" was uploaded on January 16, 2015. The song was digitally distributed four days later and its music video was concurrently released. Directed by Yong E, the music video was recorded in Seoul in the span of two days. Actress Kim Seo-jin plays Jung's love interest in the video, which was shot in the style of a Korean drama. Filming took place in various locations, including in Noksapyeong station at dawn, Gyeongnidan-gil Road at 8 am, in a shop in Itaewon, and the director's restaurant. The music video captures the onscreen couple out on a date eating fish and chips, Jung at a birthday celebration sporting a white dress shirt while holding champagne, and a somber Jung standing in midst of a dancing crowd at a New Year party. Scenes alternate between the past during the relationship and the present after the breakup contrasted by the use of wide and square screens, respectively.

Based on the BMW 3 Series (F30), the B3 is available in saloon and wagon body styles. The car was officially launched at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show.  Development and introduction  Alpina B3 (F30) Engine The B3 is based on the BMW 335i and utilises a modified version of its N55 straight six engine. Alpina modified the engine by adding two smaller variable-geometry turbochargers in place of the standard single turbocharger, NGK spark plugs, electronically controlled bypass valve system, a high-performance fuel pump, a 40 percent larger intercooler, Alpina specific ECU along with a wiring loom and a forged high- strength steel crankshaft. These modifications allow the engine to generate with RON 98 fuel and of torque at 3,000 rpm. The front subframe along with the strut brace were modified in order to accommodate the powerful engine. The engine is mated to an 8-speed ZF \\"Touch tronic\\" automatic transmission with no manual transmission available as an option. The car is available in rear- wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive configurations. The transmission consists of three modes, \\"Automatic (D)\\", \\"Manual (M)\\" and \\"Sport (S)\\". The Automatic mode focuses on driving comfort while the Sport mode reduces shift time and throttle response. When combined with the \\"Sport\\" or \\"Sport +\\" driving modes of the Drive performance system, the gearshifts are quicker due to a reduction in torque caused by the interruption of the injection of fuel into a given cylinder for a fraction of a second. The B3 has an Akrapoviƒç stainless steel exhaust system featuring quad exhaust pipes. The exhaust system has an electronically controlled valve that remains closed up to 2,500 rpm for more quiet city driving in comfort mode. In Sport mode however, the valve remains permanently open to provide optimum performance. The brakes used in the car have ventilated discs with 4-piston calipers at the front and ventilated discs with 2-piston calipers at the rear. The aluminium calipers feature Alpina lettering with classic Alpina Blue colour. The suspension system is mostly based on the donor car but features adjustable dampers and Eibach springs which are 45 percent more stiffer. The system also features Alpina specific roll bars. The car has Michelin Pilot Sport tyres with 20-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels. The car also includes Alpina tuned Sports steering and an optional limited slip differential. The company claims a combined fuel economy of 37.2 mpg. The interior includes Alpina specific sports seats and BMW iDrive infotainment system as standard equipment with USB and Bluetooth connectivity. A Harman Kardon sound system, an in-car TV and a head-up display are optional. The company gives the customer a choice of five leather and veneer trims for the interior.  Performance  Interior The B3 can accelerate from in 4.2 seconds (4.3 seconds for the wagon version) and can attain a top speed of ( for the wagon). The B3 can accelerate from in 4.2 seconds in third gear, 5.3 seconds in fourth gear and 7.3 seconds in fifth gear.  Variants   D3  Alpina D3 (F31) The D3 is the diesel powered variant of the B3. Unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show, the D3 is based on the 330d and utilises a modified version of its 335d 3.0-litre N57 inline-6 engine. The engine has received the same modification as the B3, those being a larger intercooler, Alpina specific ECU and wiring loom and a high-strength steel crankshaft. These modifications allow the engine to generate at 4,000 rpm and of torque. The engine is mated to the same 8-speed automatic transmission as found on the B3 with a limited slip differential available as an option. Like the B3, the D3 is available in either a saloon or a wagon body style. The engine delivers its peak torque from 1,500 rpm to 3,000 rpm and has a red-line of 4,800 rpm. The transmission features buttons for shifting gears mounted behind the steering column and has the same gear ratios as the donor car. The suspension system is the same as the B3 and features 40 percent stiffer springs as well as the wheels and tyres. The dampers are set to be softer in compression and firmer in rebound. The bushings and anti-rollbars are Alpina specific and the car's front sub-frame and strut-brace have been modified to accommodate the engine. There are four exterior colour choices available, those being Classic Alpina Green, Classic Alpina Blue, Sapphire Black and Mineral White with optional Alpina pinstripes. The D3 can be ordered with any option available on the standard 3 Series. Along with Alpina's own options of interior trim and leather upholstery. The D3 can accelerate from in a claimed 4.6 seconds and can attain a claimed maximum speed of . The car has a claimed combined fuel economy of 53.3 mpg.  B3 S  Introduced at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show, the B3 S is the high performance variant of the B3. The 3.0-litre twin- turbocharged inline-6 engine found in the B3 is further modified to generate and of torque. The transmission remains the same as in the standard B3 along with interior and exterior options. Performance figures include a acceleration time of 4.2 seconds (4.3 seconds for the wagon) and a top speed of . Unlike the B3, the B3 S is based on the updated 335i.

Early life and education  Shahbazov was born on 22 January 1950 in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR. In 1967, he completed his secondary education at the Secondary School No. 20 in Baku. From 1969 through 1971, Shahbazov served in the Soviet Armed Forces. In 1972, he started to work at the Television and Radio Broadcasting Company of Azerbaijan.  Personal life  Shahbazov was married and had two children.  Nagorno Karabakh War  The forceful expulsion of Azerbaijanis from Upper Karabakh and nowadays Armenia by Armenians since 1988 also worried Fakhraddin Shahbazov. He volunteered for the front-line, prepared reports from battlefields and broadcast them in the country and abroad. Despite repeated encounters with dangerous situations, he continued to go to the front-line as a reporter. In 1991, the Armenians committed unimaginable atrocities in the Khojavend District. Civilians were killed, villages were burned. On November 20, government officials and a number of other individuals departed for Khojavend on a Mi-8 helicopter to investigate these events. Near the village of Garakend in Khojavend, Armenians attacked the helicopter with heavy machine-gun fire. The Armenians did not even hesitate to insult their dead bodies.  Memorial and legacy  By Decree of the President of Azerbaijan No. 344 dated December 4, 1992, Fakhraddin Shahbazov was posthumously awarded the title of \\"National Hero of Azerbaijan\\". He was buried in the Martyrs' Lane in Baku. One of the streets in the Rasulzade settlement is named after him.

The Mazari settled throughout the Trucial States but principally in Abu Dhabi. They are considered a subsection of the Bani Yas and formed the majority of the Bedouin component of that federation of tribes.  Liwa  The Liwa Oasis was the homeplace of many of the Mazari, where they were the principal property owners of the six Bani Yas tribes in the area, consisting of some 315 houses at the turn of the 20th century. They were closely associated with the Marar at Liwa. At that time there were also some 300 Mazari at Al Khan in Sharjah and 500 in the areas of Adhen and Asimah. Those of the Mazari who settled in Dubai came to consider themselves as apart from the Bani Yas. The area around Wadi Helou in the Hajar Mountains of Sharjah is also an area of Mazari settlement. They were herdsmen and records show they settled into an agrarian existence in the oasis following the decline in the value of camels and the use of traditional camel trains which took place in the Trucial States during the early 20th century. They were also involved in the seasonal pearl fisheries. Like their Bedouin counterparts the Manasir, many Mazari found employment in the burgeoning oil industry as modernisation forced changes in the lifestyle of the Bedouin of the area. The Mazari also formed the second largest Bedouin contingent among the Ruler's retainers, being said to be loyal and \\"in their bedu fashion, disciplined.\\"  Conflict and schism  When Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnun Al Nahyan repelled the Wahhabis from the Buraimi Oasis in 1848, it was the Mazari, together with the Manasir, who waited South of Abu Dhabi to fall on the relieving force send from Nejd under Saad bin Mutlaq. The two tribes were also linked in events further north, where they were involved in a conflict with the wali of Al Khan, Muhamad bin Ubaid in 1920. Some 75 pearling boats sailed from Al Khan each season, owned by settled Mazari and Manasir families. However, the village was frequently plundered by Bedouin Mazari and Al Bu Shamis, the Ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi, and the wali being accused of doing little to protect the village, whilst also insisting on a tribute of 50 bags of rice at the commencement of each pearling season. When the wali died in 1931, the village appointed its own headman ‚Äì a move which was punished by Sultan bin Saqr, who replaced the murdered headman with his brother Muhammad. An outbreak of hostilities between the Bedouin tribes of Dhafra (the area between Abu Dhabi and the Rub Al Kali) in the early 20th century rumbled on until the early 1920s, with the Mazari split between a group who sought Saudi protection and a group who migrated to Abu Dhabi and its islands.

This excommunication by the Russian Orthodox Church was done in response to a decision of the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate to reestablish an Orthodox church in Estonia under the Ecumenical Patriarchate's canonical jurisdiction as an autonomous church on 20 February 1996. This schism has similarities with the Moscow‚ÄìConstantinople schism of October 2018. On 8 November 2000, in an official statement, the Russian Orthodox Church described this schism as \\"the tragic situation of February‚ÄìMay 1996, when, because of the schismatic actions of the Patriarchate of Constantinople in Estonia, Orthodox Christians of the Churches of Constantinople and Russia, who live all over the world in close spiritual contact, were deprived of common Eucharistic communion at the one Chalice of Christ.\\"  Brief background  Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow  Autonomy of the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church  Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, St. Tikhon, recognised in 1920 the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church (EAOC) as being autonomous (Resolution No. 1780) under the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate, postponing the discussion concerning the EAOC's autocephaly. \\"After Patriarch Tikhon‚Äôs arrest by the Soviet government, contacts between him and the autonomous Estonian Orthodox Church were severed. Consequently, the autonomous Estonian Orthodox Church, which wanted to assert its ecclesiastical independence, decided to seek a fuller and final canonical recognition from the patriarch of Constantinople.\\"Toom, Tarmo. \\"Estonia, Orthodox Church in\\", The Encyclopedia of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, p.226-8, Wiley-Blackwell Publishing, 2011.221x221px  Ecumenical Patriarchate's tomos of 1923  With the Estonian independence and the persecution of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan asked the Ecumenical Patriarchate to receive his church (the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church (EAOC)) into the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. On 7 July 1923, Patriarch Meletios IV of Constantinople issued a tomos accepting the Estonian Church in the Ecumenical Patriarchate's jurisdiction with an autonomous status (Tomos 3348). This tomos \\"established under the Ecumenical Patriarchate the Autonomous Orthodox Apostolic Church of Estonia known as \\"Orthodox Metropolitanate of Estonia\\"\\" Some Orthodox Russians in Estonia decided to remain under the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate. The Russian Orthodox Church considers that \\"Patriarch Meletius IV of Constantinople took advantage of the difficult situation of the Orthodox Church in Russia and illegally proclaimed jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople on the territory of the independent Estonia and transformed the Estonian Autonomous Orthodox Church into the Estonian Metropolia of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\\"  Exile of the Orthodox Metropolitanate of Estonia and 1978 deactivation of the tomos  Flag of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic In 1940 the Soviet Union annexed Estonia. After 1944, of the EAOC went into exile in Stockholm, Sweden, with 23 members of his clergy and 7000 (or 8000) faithfuls. The church based in Stockholm remained attached to the Ecumenical Patriarchate and served around 10,000 Estonian Orthodox exiled in various countries. After the death of Metropolitan Alexander in 1953, the Ecumenical Patriarchate consecrated a new Estonian Orthodox bishop, bishop , to oversee the Estonian Church based in Stockholm. After V√§lbe's death in 1961, his Estonian parishes were placed under local bishops of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The Orthodox Church which remained in Estonia was incorporated into the Russian Orthodox Church after the Soviet annexed Estonia. On 10 December 1944, the synod of the Moscow Patriarchate promulgated the Ukase which ended the functioning of the Orthodox Church of Estonia and established in its place the Diocese of Tallinn and Estonia. This dissolution effectively took place on 9 March 1945. The Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church later declared it considered that \\"[t]he autonomy of the Orthodox Church of Estonia, accorded in 1923 by the Oecumenical Patriarch Meletios, was abolished in March 9, 1945 by force, unilaterally without respecting the canonical order and without informing the Oecumenical Patriarch about it nor waiting for his consentment\\". In a letter sent to the then- Patriarch of Moscow Alexy II on 24 February 1996, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew wrote that \\"the Patriarchate of Russia during those years trespassed in countries under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, namely, Estonia, Hungary and elsewhere, always by the power of the Soviet army. The Church of Russia did not at the time seek the opinion of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, nor was any respect shown it. The annexation of the Orthodox Church of Estonia into the Most Holy Church of Russia happened arbitrarily and uncanonically. And it is certain that events which are uncanonical at one particular time are never blessed, never seen as efficacious, and never would they set a precedence.\\" On 13 April 1978, at the request of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Ecumenical Patriarchate deactivated the 1923 tomos which had established the autonomous Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew explained in 1996 it was \\"[d]ue to the then existing political conditions and following the persistent request of the Patriarch of Moscow\\" and \\"due to the circumstances of the times\\" as well as \\"for the sake of smooth relations with the Patriarchate of Moscow, at which time Estonia still constituted a section of the then Soviet Union\\" The Ecumenical Patriarch declared the tomos had been made \\"inoperative, but not invalid\\". \\"Due to demographic shifts, Russians made up the majority of the Orthodox population of Estonia by the end of Soviet rule.\\"  Post-Soviet period  Estonian flag after the fall of the communist regime in Estonia After the fall of the Soviet Union and the renewed independence of Estonia in 1991, a dispute developed among the Orthodox community between those who wished to remain linked to the Moscow Patriarchate and those who wanted the autonomous Orthodox church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate to be reestablished. Lengthy negotiations between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Ecumenical Patriarchate failed to produce an agreement. \\"In 1991, after Estonia had broken away from the Soviet Union, the sovereignty of the Estonian Republic was restored. At the time, the ruling Bishop in Estonia was Cornelius (Jakobs). He held negotiations with the Government concerning a number of urgent internal ecclesiastical matters, which could not be resolved without state support. On 11 August 1993, instead of registering the representatives of the Russian Orthodox Synod, the Estonian State Department of Religions registered the representatives of the ¬´Synod of the Estonian Orthodox Church in Exile¬ª as the sole legal successor of the Autonomous Estonian Apostolic Church. That registration was of political and social importance because it made the ¬´Synod of the Estonian Orthodox Church in Exile¬ª the sole owner of all church-related immovable property in Estonia. The Russian Orthodox Church started legal proceedings to defend its legal and canonical position in the country, [arguing (?)] that the ¬´Synod in Exile¬ª had neither an episcopal structure nor an administrative office in Estonia, as required by Estonian law. In 1994, another unexpected event came to be added to the above. A petition signed by the representatives of 54 out of the 83 Orthodox parishes in Estonia formally requested to join the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The 54 parishes represented the majority of the Orthodox believers in the country, and included both Estonian-speaking and Russian- speaking communities. A year later, a series of negotiations between the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Russian Orthodox Patriarchate failed to reach a solution.\\" \\"On 25 May 1995 Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, while in Finland, made a broadcast appeal to the Orthodox believers in Estonia, in which he called them to 'revive as soon as possible the Estonian Autonomous Orthodox Church in direct communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate'.\\" \\"On 3 January 1996, a delegation of the Russian Orthodox Church visited the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul for bilateral negotiations about the division among the Orthodox in Estonia. No agreement was reached, but the two sides agreed upon the continuation of the negotiations in Moscow on 2 February of the same year.\\" \\"On 4 January 1996, the Ecumenical Patriarch sent a pastoral letter ¬´to the Orthodox communities in Estonia¬ª, in which he expressed his desire to ¬´reactivate¬ª the Autonomous Estonian Apostolic Church on the basis of the Tome (or decision) of the Ecumenical Patriarch in 1923. The letter expressed the hope to unite all in one church with a distinct diocese for the Russian-speaking parishes. On 16 January 1996, a delegation from the Ecumenical Patriarchate, including one Finnish Orthodox bishop and one priest, visited Estonia in an attempt to reach a viable solution. They met with representatives of the Moscow Patriarchate and the Estonian State authorities, including Prime Minister Tiit V√§hi and the President Lennart Meri. After the meeting, statements were issued that the Ecumenical Patriarchate would accept Estonian Orthodox believers under its jurisdiction, but that it would also accept the division of the Orthodox community in Estonia into two parts and their belonging to two jurisdictions.\\"  History of the schism   20 February 1996 decision of the Ecumenical Patriarchate  Patriarch Bartholomew I|204x204px On 20 February 1996, saying it was \\"following the persistent request of the Estonian Government and the overwhelming majority of the Estonian Orthodox parishes, which requested they be placed again under the aegis of the Ecumenical Patriarchate,\\" the Ecumenical Patriarchate decided to reestablish an Orthodox church in Estonia under the Ecumenical Patriarchate's canonical jurisdiction as an autonomous church by reactivating the tomos of 1923 which had been issued by Ecumenical Patriarch Meletios IV. On 22 February 1996, the Ecumenical Patriarchate officially announced its decision to reactivate the tomos of 1923 and to re- establish the Autonomous Estonian Apostolic Church. This was done on the basis of the EAOC's continued existence in exile in Sweden. On 24 February 1996, a delegation of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, led by Metropolitan Joachim of Chalcedon, concelebrated the Divine Liturgy with Estonian clergy and in the presence of Archbishop John of Finland at the Church of the Transfiguration of Our Lord in Tallinn. That act marked the reactivation of the Autonomous Estonian Apostolic Church. On the same day, the Chief Secretariat of the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate issued an official communiqu√©. In that communiqu√©, it was announced that Archbishop John of Karelia, primate of the Finnish Orthodox Church, had been assigned as locum tenens of the Autonomous Estonian Apostolic Church.190x190px  Excommunication of the Ecumenical Patriarchate by the Russian Orthodox Church  On 23 February 1996, the Russian Orthodox Church decided to declare the Ecumenical Patriarch and the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church \\"as schismatic\\", \\"to suspend canonical and Eucharistic communion with the Patriarchate of Constantinople... and to omit the name of the Patriarch of Constantinople in the diptych of the Primates of the Local Orthodox Churches\\". The next day, on 24 February, to justify the Ecumenical Patriarchate's decision taken on 20 February 1996, the Ecumenical Patriarchate issued a communiqu√©, and the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew sent a letter to the then-Patriarch of Moscow Alexy II.  Negotiations between the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Russian Orthodox Church  On 3 and 22 April in 1996, the Joint Commission of the Patriarchates of Constantinople and Moscow met in Zurich to discuss the situation. On 4 March, head of the DECR, Metropolitan Kirill, said the transfer of the EAOC under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate was \\"canonically illegal\\" and that the ROC was ready to negotiate with the Ecumenical Patriarchate on the issue.  Agreement and resolutions  On 16 May 1996, an agreement was reached and the communion between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Ecumenical Patriarchate was restored. Both parties agreed: This agreement de facto led to the existence of two Orthodox churches on the Estonian territory: the Estonian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate and the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church. By this agreement, both the EAOC and the ROC agreed to tolerate each others \\"at least temporarily\\". After this decision, in Estonia 54 parishes were part of the EAOC, 29 were part of the ROC. In September 1996, it was decided to prolong for another three months the moratorium concerning the Ecumenical Patriarchate's 20 February 1996 decision to reactivate its tomos. Other subsequent meetings between the Church of Constantinople and the Russian Orthodox Church were held in order to find a final agreement, but without much results. On 1 September 2000, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew declared he considered the 16 May 1996 decision as a \\"decision, which allows the existence of the two parallel jurisdictions in Estonia\\", while the Russian Orthodox Church officially stated it totally disagreed with this interpretation of the decision by the Ecumenical Patriarch and considered that Estonia was under the canonical jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate and that \\"the Orthodox communities on the territory of Estonia have been a part of the Russian Orthodox Church for seven centuries\\". 301x301px  Appointment of the Metropolitan of Tallinn and All Estonia by the Ecumenical Patriarchate  On 9 March 1999, the Congress of the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church met in Tallinn to consider the fact that the church still did not have a primate. Representatives from the Patriarchate of Constantinople were also present at the congress. The Congress decided to ask the Patriarchate to appoint Bishop Stephanos (auxiliary bishop of the ) as primate. On 13 March 1999, the Synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople accepted the request and elected Stephanos as . While announcing this decision, Patriarch Bartholomew asked the Russian Orthodox Church to recognize Metropolitan Stephan as the \\"canonical and legal first hierarch of the Estonian Orthodox Church\\". The Russian Orthodox Church, \\"surely considering the region of Estonia an autonomous part of the historical canonical territory of the Moscow Patriarchate\\", refused to recognize the status of Metropolitan Stephanos granted to him by the Ecumenical Patriarchate. On 21 March 1999, bishop Stephanos was enthroned Metropolitan of Tallinn and All Estonia at the Church of the Transfiguration of Our Lord in Tallinn. Thereafter, Stephanos began preparing the General Assembly of the Church. The General Assembly took place on 21 June 1999 and the organs of the Church, the Synod and the Auditing Committee, were elected there. Moreover, Metropolitan Stephanos announced the names of the vicars general and of his secretariat. In January 2009, the Orthodox Church of Estonia established a synodal structure with the ordinations of two bishops: the bishop of Tartu, , and the bishop of P√§rnu-Saaremaa, .  Aftermath   Continuous tensions  After the Zurich agreement, tensions continued to exist between the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church and the Estonian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate. Metropolitan Stephanos declared in 1999 and in 2002 that there could only be one local Orthodox church in Estonia, but he does not oppose the Moscow Patriarchate turning the Estonian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate into a diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church in Estonia. According to the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church, the agreements decided at Zurich could have been the base which \\"could have launched a constructive common future\\" between both local churches of Estonia (the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church and the Estonian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate), but according to the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church the Russian Orthodox Church did not apply those agreements decided at Zurich whereas the Ecumenical Patriarchate did. On 8 November 2000, in response to the 1 September 2000 visit of the Ecumenical Patriarch in Estonia, the Russian Orthodox Church, in an official statement, explained in details their version of the history of the 1996 schism. This statement also says that the Church of Constantinople had refused to hold the negotiations on 1 September 2000 for the visit of the Ecumenical Patriarch in Estonia; the goal of those negotiations would have been \\"to put an end to the four-years-long confrontation between the jurisdictions of the two Churches in Estonia\\". The official statement concluded: \\"The establishment by the Patriarchate of Constantinople of its jurisdiction in Estonia in February 1996, the appointment of ‚ÄòMetropolitan of All Estonia‚Äô in March 1999 and the announcement made during Patriarch Bartholomew‚Äôs visit to Estonia in October 2000 of the renunciation of the compromise agreements which envisage parallel presence of the two jurisdiction in Estonia speak for the consistent intention of Constantinople to usurp canonical authority in Estonia and to deprive the Estonian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate not only of the legal, but also of the canonical right of succession in the country\\" In 2007, delegates from the Russian Orthodox Church walked out of theological discussions with the Catholic Church because the Russian Orthodox Church did not recognize the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church and that, according to the statement by the Russian Orthodox Church issued thereafter, \\"the joint participation by delegates of the Moscow Patriarchate and the so-called Estonian Apostolic Church in an official session would mean the implicit recognition by the Moscow Patriarchate of the canonical (nature) of this church structure.\\" \\"In 2008 the Russian Orthodox Church suspended its membership of the Conference of European Churches over the dispute about the non-admittance of that part of the Estonian Orthodox Church which had decided to remain linked to the patriarchate of Moscow.\\" In 2008, the Russian Orthodox Church issued an ultimatum: the ROC would walk out of the Anglican-Orthodox dialogue if the EAOC was taking part in the dialogue. \\"In the same year the Russian Orthodox Church terminated its ecumenical dialogue with the Anglicans because the EAOC was participating as a recognized member church in this dialogue.\\" \\"The Moscow patriarchate continues to make two major claims that are unacceptable to the EAOC. The first is that the EAOC was established in 1996 (thus negating the Tomos of 1923); and the second is that Estonia remains as a canonical territory of the Russian Orthodox Church ‚Äì widely taken to be a negation of Estonia as a sovereign state, deserving autocephaly in due season.\\" In September 2018, Metropolitan Hilarion, chairman of the Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, in a message to mass medias which was published on the official website of the External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, declared: \\"the problem of Estonia, from our point of view, has not been solved, and the existence of two parallel jurisdictions, again from the point of view of church canons, is an anomaly.\\"  2018 Moscow‚ÄìConstantinople schism  Patriarch Kirill of Moscow who was the Patriarch of Moscow when the 278x278px The 1996 schism has similarities with the schism of October 2018. Both schisms were caused by a dispute between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Ecumenical Patriarchate over the canonical jurisdiction over a territory in Eastern Europe upon which the Russian Orthodox Church claimed to have the exclusive canonical jurisdiction, territory which after the collapse of the Soviet Union had become an independent state (Ukraine, Estonia). The break of communion in 1996 was made by Moscow unilaterally, as in 2018. The fact that the 1996 schism over Estonia lasted only three months \\"has raised hope in some quarters that the new [2018 Moscow‚ÄìConstantinople] schism might also be short\\"; a source from the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church even declared the Russian Orthodox Church \\"will likely back down [over Ukraine], just as it did over Estonia\\". However, on 15 October 2018, just after the break of full communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate by the ROC, Metropolitan Hilarion, chairman of the Moscow Patriarchate‚Äôs Department for External Church Relations, said in an interview to the mass media that \\"in 1996, the Church of Constantinople intruded into canonical territory of the Russian Church by establishing its jurisdiction in Estonia, and we were forced to break the Eucharistic communion with this Church\\"; Hilarion added that the Russian Orthodox Church \\"had not recognized this decision [of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in 1996] and do[es] not recognize it. However, the canonical crimes committed by the Patriarchate of Constantinople now [in 2018 after the 11 October 2018 declaration of the Ecumenical Patriarchate] are more grievous as it declared its intention to grant an autocephaly to a part of the Russian Orthodox Church, and not the part which once belonged to Constantinople.\\" In an interview given to the BBC on 2 November 2018, Archbishop Job, hierarch of the Church of Constantinople, rejected the idea that there could be two jurisdictions over Ukraine the way there is two jurisdictions in Estonia, stating that canonically there could be only one church on the territory of Ukraine and that therefore an exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine was \\"simply uncanonical\\" and that in Ukraine \\"there can be no repetition of Estonia‚Äôs scenario\\".

A native of Strasbourg, Loesel joined the order at Eichen (Eichhof) near Wei√üenburg. In 1426, he was given the commandery of Mainz. He acted as commander at Mainz during 1429-1439\\\\. In 1434, he also received command of Rheinfelden. In 1440, he was given the rank of great bailiff at Rhodes, an office created for the German tongue of the order in 1428. The grand bailiff of the German tongue was responsible for the fortifications of Rhodes. In 1444, Loesel was made grand prior of Germany, resigning from the office of grand bailiff and returning to Europe. He was responsible for the commanderies of Basel, Bubikon, Leuggern and W√§denswil, mostly residing in W√§denswil. In February 1446 he acted as mediator between Z√ºrich and the Swiss Confederacy in the Old Z√ºrich War. The delegates met on boats on Lake Z√ºrich, with Loesel mediating peace talks rom his own boat. The mediation did not result in a peace treaty, and the war continued for another four years, until the treaty of Kappel of 8 April 1450. The commandery at Rheinfelden was destroyed in an attack by Hans von Rechberg in 1449. In 1455, Loesel was in Vienna at the court of Archduke Albert to ask for permission to rebuild the destroyed commandery. In the following year, he was present at the building site in Rheinfelden, designating the site for the new chapel. In 1456, he sponsored the rebuilding of the church at W√§denswil. He died on 8 April 1460 and was buried in the order's church there. The church has been destroyed and his epitaph is not extant except in a drawing.

The Sharqiyin were long the dominant tribe along the East coast of the Trucial States (and the second most numerous in the area around the start of the 19th century), an area known as Shamailiyah. A 1968 census showed 90% of the tribal population of Fujairah was Sharqiyin. They were traditionally dependents of Sharjah and, over the centuries, made several attempts to secede and declare independence, finally practically managing this from 1901 onwards and finally gaining British recognition as a Trucial State, Fujairah, in 1952. They settled all along the East Coast of the Trucial States, from Kalba to Dibba, as well as in the Wadi Ham and Jiri plain and by the turn of the 20th century they were some 7,000 strong. Three sections of the tribe are notable, the Hafaitat (from which the ruling family of Fujairah derives), the Yammahi and the Hamudiyin. After the Bani Yas, the Sharqiyin were the second most numerous tribe in the Trucial States.  Independence  Fujairah Fort today In 1879, the head of the Hafaitat, Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Sharqi, led an insurrection against Sheikh Saqr bin Khalid Al Qasimi of Sharjah, who claimed suzerainty over the Shamaliyah and had placed a slave named Sarur in charge of Fujairah. The insurrection replaced Sarur and a delegation was sent to Sheikh Saqr but they were badly received, imprisoned and a force sent back against the insurrectionists, taking Fujairah Fort and forcing Hamad bin Abdullah into exile. At the end of that year or possibly early 1880, Hamad returned from his exile and led a fresh bid to proclaim the independence of Fujairah, this time forcing a rout of Fujairah Fort, with eight men among the defenders killed. The settlement of a peace was placed in front of the Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah to arbitrate and, in 1881, Hamad bin Abdullah signed a document confirming him as a dependent of Sharjah. However, he expanded his influence over the area, taking Al Bithnah Fort in a move which was to support his eventual declaration of independence from Sharjah in 1901, a move which enjoyed the recognition of this status by all concerned, with the sole exception of the British. Fujairah's status as a Trucial State was not formally recognised by the British until 1952. Subsisting in the main on agriculture, pearling and fishing, the Sharqiyin lived a relatively harsh life, a fact underlined by a survey of the late 1960s, which showed the majority of households in the emirate of Fujairah still lived in barasti (palm frond) houses.  Conflict  The Sharqiyin were frequently in conflict with their neighbours, particularly the Shihuh, Khawatir and Naqbiyin, but would make common cause with these against Sharjah whenever the opportunity arose. The long history of squabbles and disputes between the Sharqiyn and neighbouring tribes came to the fore once again following the act of Union, when a land dispute with Kalba broke out into open fighting. In early 1972, the newly founded Union Defence Force was called in to take control of the fighting which, by the time the UDF moved in, had killed 22 and seriously injured a dozen more. The dispute was finally settled after mediation between Sheikh Rashid of Dubai and other Rulers and a statement announcing the settlement was sent out on 17 July 1972.

He was born in Saint-Malo on October 5, 1870 and died in Le Havre on July 19, 1938.  Biography  Since childhood he started drawing frequently. Auguste Lemoine (1848-1909), a drawing teacher at the college of Saint-Malo from 1883 to 1903 inspired him to draw from nature and in colour. Under the direction of Auguste Lemoine, Malo- Renault experimented with etchings. After completing his Bachelor of Arts, Malo-Renault went on to study architecture in Paris as a St√©phane Pannemaker student at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des arts d√©coratifs. It was only after his marriage in 1897 with Honorine Tian (1871-1953), known as Nori Malo- Renault, a student of etcher G√©ry-Bichard, that Malo-Renault began his engraving career with the support of his wife for the development of color prints, in particular in Le serpent noir by Paul Adam. Between 1903 and 1928 he participated in many exhibitions at the Salon of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts, where he was a member from 1910. It is a representative of the art nouveau style with a Japanese influence.

It is their second album and was recorded in Oakland, California in January 2018, and released in September 2018 by Intakt Records in Switzerland. It follows on from their first album, Another Day in Fucking Paradise that was released in June 2016. Reception In a review in DownBeat magazine, music critic Peter Margasak described Frith's ensemble as \\"a scrappy improvising trio\\" who \\"deftly\\" revisit many of Frith's musical endeavors in \\"a gritty, unified attack\\". He wrote that on Closer to the Ground the improvisations are \\"groove-oriented\\" and have their roots in rock music. Melodies surface occasionally, but the trio focuses on \\"exploring the nexus of groove and mood\\" without remaining in one place for too long. Andy Robson wrote in the British monthly, Jazzwise that Closer to the Ground is \\"nearer to jazz heaven\\". He complimented Frith's \\"discipline and control\\", saying that there are no fillers, licks are not repeated. Robson also praised Hoopes' \\"fascinating foil\\" to Frith's guitar, and in particular Glenn's \\"colours, accents and pared-down patterns ... that underwrite this odyssey\\". Reviewing the album for the German radio station WDR 3, Karl Lippegaus said it picks up from where their first album left off. The trio's spontaneous arrangements lead to \\"chain reactions\\" (Kettenreaktionen), and while on the surface Closer to the Ground appears to be similar to their debut album, it turns out to be quite different with its tangle of \\"complex soundscapes\\" (komplexen Soundscapes). Writing on the website In On The Corner, Kevin Coultas described the Fred Frith Trio as one of Frith's \\"most superlative\\" bands since Henry Cow. He complimented the rhythm section of Hoopes and Glenn, saying that they \\"lay down metronomic and/or shifting grooves\\" that produce \\"sunset-like colors on which Frith eviscerates and/or gently highlights with an array of engaging tremolo and reverberant effects\\". Coultas praised Intakt Records for producing \\"such a vital statement from a singular artist and his inventive crew\\". Track listing All tracks composed by the Fred Frith Trio.

Grossman), better known by his alias Blippi, is an American children's entertainer and educator on YouTube, Hulu, and Amazon Video. The Blippi character which John portrays has a childlike, energetic and curious persona and is always dressed in a blue and orange beanie cap, blue shirt, orange suspenders and a bow tie. John was formerly a gross out comedian known as Steezy Grossman. Early life Stevin John grew up \\"surrounded by tractors, cows and horses\\", in Ellensburg, Washington, and has stated that as a child he wished to be a limousine driver and a fighter pilot. Military service Stevin John served active duty in the United States Air Force as a loadmaster for the C-17 Globemaster airplane at the 4th Airlift Squadron and is a military veteran. His duties were to perform the calculations and planning cargo placement to keep the aircraft within permissible center of gravity limits throughout the flight. Blippi The idea for Blippi came to Stevin John after moving back to Ellensburg, and witnessing his then two-year-old nephew viewing low-quality videos on YouTube. Blippi has been described as, \\"an adult human man who dresses up in bright clothes and dances around America‚Äôs deserted soft play centres for the benefit of YouTube\\". The first Blippi video was published on January 27, 2014, with John starring as Blippi and doing all of the filming, editing and graphics himself on the initial videos. Taking inspiration from children's educators and entertainers before him, such as Mr. Rogers, John wished to portray Blippi as educational, but also as thinking and acting as a child would. The videos would eventually garner a large following with over a billion views on YouTube, and the production staff expanding. The Blippi team would begin producing videos in Spanish, establish Blippi Toys, and begin offering DVDs and digital downloads from the Blippi website. Although Blippi's childlike demeanor has met with much success from children, some parents have questioned the simplistic nature of the character in regards to his tone and repetitive songs about things such as garbage trucks, fire trucks and pizza. In 2019, John was criticized for a \\"bait and switch\\" in which a Blippi tour was advertised, with parents paying high sums for tickets, but the actual performance was by a Blippi impersonator. The producer and promoter of the Blippi Live show stated that the announcements and advertisements clearly indicated that John would not be on the tour; a refund was offered to ticket holders. Steezy Grossman Stevin John started making gross out videos in 2013 under the persona of Steezy Grossman, a boy born as poop. Under his Steezy Grossman alias, John developed videos such as \\"Turdboy\\" and \\"Underwear Man\\". In a 2013 video John performed the Harlem shake on a toilet and defecated on a naked friend. When the video was unearthed by Buzzfeed in 2019, John said, \\"at the time, I thought this sort of thing was funny, but really it was stupid and tasteless, and I regret having ever done it.\\" John used DMCA takedown notices to remove the video from social media and internet search engines.
