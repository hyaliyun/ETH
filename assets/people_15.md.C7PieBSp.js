Gibson spent much of his early criminal career with the Central Park Gang based in Tulsa, Oklahoma which included the Barkers, Volney Davis, Ray Terrill and other local criminal figures. He participated in his first major robbery when he teamed with Neal Merritt and James \\"Cowboy\\" Long to rob a bank messenger in Oklahoma City of $75,000. Gibson was arrested for this robbery but escaped from county jail prior to his trial.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 119-120) He later joined up with the Barker-Karpis gang and participated in numerous bank robberies with them. He, like the rest of the gang, was tracked down by the FBI during early 1935. Federal agents managed to trace him and his wife to a Chicago hideout used by the Barkers and raided the apartment building on January 8, 1935. The raid was bungled from the start as the FBI set off tear gas in the wrong apartment causing a panic among the tenants. When local police officers arrived on the scene, they nearly opened fire on federal agents whom they believed were gangsters. Hoping to escape in the confusion, Gibson attempted to make it to the fire escape armed with a Browning automatic rifle and a .32 caliber pistol. FBI agents were waiting for Gibson however and opened fire. Despite wearing a bulletproof vest, the agents' high-powered rifles killed him instantly.Breuer, William B. J. Edgar Hoover and his G-Men. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995. (pg. 146) His wife was arrested on charges of harboring a fugitive; two other gang members, Byron Bolton and Doc Barker, were also captured.

It has about 1,200 inhabitants. The municipality was established in 1951 by the merger of St≈ô√≠brn√© Hory () with Nal≈æovy (). Geography Nal≈æovsk√© Hory is situated in southwestern Bohemia, in the foothills of the Bohemian Forest, approximately east of Klatovy, south of the regional capital Plze≈à, and south-west of Prague. The town covers an area of , and has a population of around 1,200.

History Pra≈°ivice Castle Nal≈æov in the Kingdom of Bohemia was first mentioned in a 1379 deed, then a possession of the Lords of Pabƒõnice. After King Vladislaus II had granted miming privileges (Bergregal), the neighbouring settlement of Silberberg was established by German miners in 1521 and elevated to a separate royal mining community in 1530. The mines were depleted in the late 17th century and abandoned. In 1769 the Ellischau estates were acquired by Nicholas Taaffe, 6th Viscount Taaffe, chamberlain to Empress Maria Theresa, from the compensation he had received for his seized Irish possessions. The Viscounts Taaffe had an artificial ruin resembling their former Irish family home, Ballymote Castle, built in the nearby Pra≈°ivice Forest about 1840. Incorporated into the Austrian Empire in 1804, Ellischau and Silberberg from 1850 formed two separate municipalities within the district of Klattau. Silberberg was raised to the status of a town in 1853. Part of the First Czechoslovak Republic from 1918, Richard Taaffe (1898‚Äì1967) finally sold Ellischau Castle in 1936. The municipality of Nal≈æovsk√© Hory regained town privileges in 2007.

Holden was described by a spokesman for the FBI as \\"a menace to every man, woman and child in America\\" and was the first fugitive to be officially listed on the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted List in 1950. History Early years Thomas Holden and Francis Keating began robbing payroll deliveries, and then train and bank robberies, before becoming one of the most notorious holdup teams by the end of the 1920s. Their most successful heist was the 1926 hijacking of a U.S. Mail truck at Evergreen Park, Illinois; they escaped with $135,000. They eluded capture for two years before they were finally arrested by federal officers. In the end, Holden and Keating were both convicted on May 25, 1928, and each sentenced to 25 years in prison.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 137-138) Escape from Leavenworth and Midwest crime spree Sent to Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary, they spent two years there before escaping on February 28, 1930. They were helped by fellow inmate George \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly who supplied them with forged passes. Holden and Keating fled to Chicago, and from there to St. Paul, where they quickly formed a new gang who were recruited from the city's thriving underworld. This gang included Frank \\"Jelly\\" Nash, Harvey Bailey and George Kelly. All were career criminals. The gang committed a series of major daylight robberies during 1930 and 1931, during which several minor and one-time members were killed. The gang's first robbery occurred on July 15, 1930, when they robbed a bank in Willmar, Minnesota and stole $70,000. Harvey Bailey, George Kelly, and Vernon Miller participated in the robbery along with at least four other men. Three of these alleged gunmen, Mike Rusick, Frank \\"Weinie\\" Coleman, and Samuel \\"Jew Sammy\\" Stein, were later found shot to death at White Bear Lake. Reportedly, this occurred during a dispute with the unstable Vernon Miller. Lawrence De Vol joined the next robbery, which netted $40,000 from a bank in Lincoln, Nebraska on September 9, 1930. Eddie Bentz joined with the gang in its next two robberies, first stealing $24,000 on September 19, 1930, and then, in their most successful heist, stealing $2.6 million in securities from a safe. The gang immediately went into hiding, but Holden and Keating resurfaced several months later and robbed $58,000 from a pair of bank messengers in Duluth, Minnesota on October 2, 1931. That same month, they joined Charlie Harmon and Frank Weber and robbed a bank in Menomonie, Wisconsin, taking away $130,000. James Kraft, a cashier and son of the bank president, was taken as a hostage during the escape and later was found shot to death outside the town. The bodies of Harmon and Weber were also found by police, both similarly shot to death and believed at the time to have been killed by their partners for the murder of Kraft. One of the suspects of the Menomonie holdup, Bob Newbourne, later confessed to the robbery and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Time with the Karpis-Barker Gang After the Menomonie heist, Holden and Keating joined the Alvin Karpis-Barker Gang. On June 17, 1932, they joined a gang made up of Karpis, Fred Barker, George Kelly, Harvey Bailey, Lawrence De Vol, and Verne Miller and robbed a bank in Fort Scott, Kansas for $47,000. Not only did they escape, but Frank Sawyer, Jim Clark and Ed Davis, who were arrested and convicted of the robbery, did as well. Less than a month later, Keating and Holden were arrested by federal agents while playing golf with Harvey Bailey in Kansas City, on July 7. The fourth robber, Bernard Phillips, slipped away during the confusion, but was later killed in New York City. It was reported that he was murdered by Frank Nash and Verne Miller, who suspected that he was an FBI informant. Return to Leavenworth and final years Holden and Keating were returned to Leavenworth, where they remained for nearly two decades. Holden was paroled on November 28, 1947. Two and a half years later, he killed his wife and two of her brothers during a drunken family argument in Chicago on June 6, 1949. In March 1950, Holden was announced as the first fugitive to be listed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted List. Fifteen months later, on June 23, 1951, Holden was spotted in Beaverton, Oregon, by a local resident and acquaintance who had seen his picture in The Oregonian, a local newspaper, on June 20. Holden had been living in the area for some time under the name John McCullough. He was arrested at his job site where he worked as a plasterer. After being extradited to Chicago, he confessed the murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He died in prison two years later. Keating returned to St. Paul and lived in retirement until his death from heart failure on July 25, 1978.

History The Morzin family The village was the seat of the aristocratic Morzin family, headed by Count Morzin. The handsome Morzin Palace survives but is not in good condition. In 1988 it was reported as being used as a mental hospital; at present it is empty. The current owners have begun restoration work and seek additional funding to accelerate the process. Haydn During the mid-18th century the Morzin family was very musical, and in 1759 (by some sources, 1757For discussion of the uncertainty see Robbins Landon and Jones (1988, 34) and Webster and Feder (2001, 10).) they hired the young composer Joseph Haydn to serve as their Kapellmeister (music director), leading the family's small orchestra. Haydn followed the Morzins back and forth in their annual migrations: summers in Doln√≠ Lukavice (referred to as \\"Lukavec\\" in most Haydn biographies), and winters in the imperial capital of Vienna.Geiringer (1982, 36) It was Haydn's first professional position, and as Kapellmeister he composed and premiered his first 15 or so symphonies. Financial trouble forced the Morzins to disband their musical establishment in 1761, and Haydn changed jobs to work for the (far wealthier) Esterh√°zy family.

The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 141) History The gang's first known robbery took place on February 28, 1935, when they stole $4,000 from a bank in Haines City, Florida. They soon hit another Florida bank in Mulberry on August 1, 1935, and in one of their biggest robberies took $30,459 from a bank in Ybor City on March 3, 1936. Their last major robbery in Foley, Alabama netted only $7,242 as, by that time, they were being pursued by the FBI. With the vast majority of Midwestern \\"public enemies\\" having been killed or imprisoned, federal agents turned their attentions towards other parts of the country. The gang managed to evade capture for three and a half years until Hunt and Gant were arrested by authorities in Houston, Texas, convicted on federal bank robbery charges and given long prison sentences.

The group includes many rouletted and pseudo-rouletted rims and shoulder sherds. These and an inverted rim sherd, suggest a pre conquest date\\". Found in Rutland. Stamford ware is a type of lead-glazed earthenware, one of the earliest forms of glazed ceramics manufactured in England. It was produced in Stamford, Lincolnshire between the ninth and thirteenth centuries. It was widely traded across Britain and the near continent. The most popular forms were jugs, spouted pitchers, and small bowls. Distribution of Stamford ware has been used to map trade routes of the period. Early Stamford glazes are essentially lead glazes, and it has been suggested they were unique among early English glazes as they contain traces of silver but not tin.Simpson G 1982, 'Part Four: Section IV The Pottery'. In Mahany C, Burchard A and Simpson G, Excavations in Stamford Lincolnshire 1963-1969. The Society for Medieval Archaeology Monograph Series: No 9 The glaze was applied with a brush and can be pale yellow, orange, pale green and smoke blue. This depended on many factors including glaze composition, iron content and whether fired in reduced or oxidised conditions. Examples can be seen at Stamford Museum and elsewhere. Greenish Anglo-Saxon pottery discovered in the town in 1950 suggests lead glaze was in use in early times. A medieval kiln was found during work at Stamford School in 1963, and a much earlier one in Stamford Castle in 1976. Various modern potters have produced work inspired by Stamford ware, including Joba in Stamford in the 1970s. No potter is currently making salt glaze work in the area.

The family descended from John Grubb, who came to the Delaware Valley from Cornwall in 1677. The youngest of four children, Stan mastered the clarinet, all saxophones, flute, piccolo, oboe, English horn, and bassoon. He performed with the Philadelphia Orchestra at age 13. About 1925, Stan married Ione Dorothy Renfro, (b. Aug. 1, 1904, Texas; d. Mar 1981, Oklahoma City). They had two children: Robert Stanley Grubb (b. 1930) and Laura Lou Saxton, ' Grubb (b. 1932; d. 1962 Alaska). Stan and Ione divorced in about 1933.Divorce was likely filed in Oklahoma City Stan remarried to Marietta P. Livingston (1913‚Äì1963), who also sang with Stan 's Orchestra. After World War II, a variety of economic factors led to the decline of big band, according to a Denver Post interview with Keller -- factors that included (i) a rise in living and travel expenses, (ii) the advent of television, (iii) the diminishing power of radio, and (iv) shifting musical tastes.Alan Katz, Bandleader for the Stork, _The Denver Post_ , Sect. E, Aug 30, 1987 Keller couldn't make a living the way he was used to, so he moved to Colorado Springs in 1946, where we remained until 1986. He fell in love with the area after playing at Copper Grove at the old Antlers Hotel in 1945. For the ensuing 40 years in Colorado Springs, Keller played at the Garden of the Gods Club, the Tavern at The Broadmoor resort, and the New Terrace at the old Antlers Hotel. In Colorado Springs, he owned and operated Stan Keller's Dress Wear, Keller's Camera Craft, and the Ute Trading Post. In 1964, Stan Keller married a third time to Cecelia Helen Zika, ' Stumph (b. 1909, Willow Lake, SD; d. 2002, Lakewood, Colorado), who used Stan's real surname, Grubb. She was the widow of Robert Francis Zika (b. 1909 Cedar Rapids, Iowa; d. 1953, Boulder, CO), a portrait photographer and band leader. Stan's death records (Social Security Death Index) used his stage surname, Keller. He is buried at Evergreen Cemetery, Colorado Springs, next to his second wife, Marietta P. Keller Grubb.

He was listed on the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted in late 1955, and was apprehended by the FBI that same year.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 168-169) Newton, Michael. The FBI Encyclopedia. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, 2003. (pg. 402) Biography A longtime career criminal, John Allen Kendrick was first arrested by the Baltimore Police Department and charged with larceny and murder in May 1923. He was convicted of larceny and a reduced assault charge, sentenced to five years imprisonment, and released on December 24, 1928. Two years later, he was convicted on a concealed weapons charge and sentenced to two and a half years in February 1930. He escaped from prison on September 2, 1931, but was indicted six months later for shooting a police officer in Washington, DC and sentenced to ten years at the federal penitentiary in Lorton, Virginia. On July 3, 1933, Kendrick escaped from the correctional facility and eventually joined up with the Tri-State Gang, a group of Depression-era bank robbers and stick-up men active in the Mid-Atlantic United States during the early to mid-1930s. The gang were responsible for countless robberies in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Washington, DC. In June 1934, Kendrick was arrested in Johnson City, Tennessee and returned to Lorton. He remained there for a brief time and transferred to Alcatraz, then to Leavenworth federal penitentiary in July 1941. He remained in Leavenworth for the rest of his sentence but, instead of being released, he was instead extradited to New Jersey to finish his original prison sentence for the 1930 weapons charge. He was finally released after being granted parole in June 1943. Four years after his release, Kendrick was arrested for the murder of an underworld figure in Washington, DC in June 1947. Tried and convicted on December 10 of that year, he was sentenced to between 3 and 10 years in Leavenworth. He was paroled in March 1954 but arrested nine months later after being identified as the assailant of the man who had seriously wounded a Washington, DC resident after shooting the man in the throat. Indicted for the shooting in August 1955, he was charged with \\"unlawful flight to avoid prosecution\\" a month later and was officially added to the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted on November 2. Kendrick was tracked down by the FBI within a month and was arrested by federal agents in Chicago on December 5, 1955. He was apprehended without incident and extradited back to Washington, DC where he convicted and given a long jail sentence. Kendrick testified that he had been offered $2,500 to murder Michael Lee but declined the job because \\"when I got done paying taxes out of that, what would I have left?\\"\\"Miscellany, Jan. 7, 1957: Death Duty.\\" Time. 7 Jan. 1957.

It has an installed capacity of 2,997 MW. Construction of the power plant was completed when a ninth and final generator was brought online in January 2015. Gigantic hydroelectric power station got handed over after 40 years  History  One of the nine turbines of the dam. Preparatory works for the dam started in 1974, with construction of roads and a support point at the Koda seasonal settlement.G. K. Sukhanov and M. I. Levitskii \\"Angara Sequence of Hydroelectric Stations\\". Gidrotekhlcheskoe Stroltel'stvo, volume 12, issue 4, pages 3-9. Translation by Plenum UDC 621.311.21(282.256.34). The design was performed by Hydroproject in 1976. Construction of the power station started in 1980 but was suspended in 1994 due to the lack of financing. Work on the project resumed in 2005 when RAO UES (then owner of RusHydro) and Rusal agreed to develop the project jointly. Construction restarted in 2007. The first turbine was dispatched in 2008. The dam began to fill its reservoir in May 2012. The filling required relocating various small settlements and flooded the valleys of several tributaries, including the Koda river.Andrzej Jagus and Martyna Rzetala (2013): \\"Environmental Consequences of the Construction of the Boguchany Dam ‚Äì Present Change and Projections\\". Proc. 13th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference (SGEM 2013), volume I. By August 2012 the first two turbines were installed. They later became operational on 15 October 2012. The third generator began operations later the same month and the fourth was commissioned on 13 January 2013.  Description  The Boguchany Dam is a long dam of combined type, which includes reinforced concrete long gravity segment for power station building and long rock-fill segment with asphaltene-concrete diaphragm throughout all its length. The dam was equipped with ship lock until 2010, later it was closed and its former location was included in concrete gravity section. The power station consists of nine Francis turbines with a capacity of 333 MW each. It generates 17.6 TWh of electricity per year. Turbines are manufactured by Power Machines. The power station is owned and operated by JSC Boguchanskaya GES, a joint venture of RusHydro and Rusal, who also built it. Energy from the plant is partly used by the Boguchany Aluminium Smelter.  Locale  Main facilities of the dam are located on the Angara river, in Kodinsk gorge, 444 km upstream from the river mouth, and are surrounded by taiga. The Angara flows in latitudinal direction here, cutting through Cambrian and Ordovician sedimentary massif interspersed with diabase intrusions. The valley's width barely exceeds 1 mile here, with rocky asymmetric bluffs overhanging the riverstream. The region is potentially seismic, with up to 7 degrees MSK-64 earthquake chance (1 in 5000 years possible recurrence). As it reaches the dam, The Angara's river basin area accounts for 831,000 km3. The river's supply is greatly dependent on the lake Baikal and superincumbent reservoirs of Irkutsk, Bratsk and Ust-Ilimsk dams. The Angara's discharge amounts to 16,210 m¬≥/s. The climatic conditions in the vicinity may be described as continental. Summers are short and warm, whilst winters are prolonged and severe. Annual average temperature ranges between ‚àí2,6 to ‚àí4,3 ¬∞–°, with the average July high of +18,5 ¬∞–° and the average January low of ‚àí27,4 ¬∞–°.  Navigation conditions improvement  In 2012, the present design of all dams on the Angara river doesn't allow passage of any ships. Additionally the river was not navigable within the section between Boguchany Dam and Ust-Ilimsk Dam. After its completion in 2012-2013 the reservoir of the Boguchany Dam will be long and will reach Ust-Ilimsk Dam upstream. It will flood the last section of the Angara channel, which was inaccessible for safe navigation because of shallow rapids in the river. The downstream part of the river has a shallow channel too and stays unavailable for large seaworthy ships. According to various sources related to this subject, there are plans to build additional dams in the lower part of Angara river or, according to original soviet plans, to build one large hydro power plant in Yenisei River below its join with Angara. The latter variant presumes construction of the largest hydro power plant in Russia with an annual production of over 40 TWh.

His most famous clients were John Dillinger and Homer Van Meter who hired him to perform plastic surgery on them.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 178-179) Biography Early life Wilhem Loeser was born in Barby Posen Germany on November 8, 1876. At age 12, he emigrated to the United States with his mother and five siblings. The family lived in Iowa for ten years, and then moved on to Kansas. In 1905, Loeser graduated from medical school in Chicago and briefly practiced in Kansas before returning to Chicago. He established himself as a pharmacist and surgeon, once referred to as a \\"magician with a knife\\". Crime career Loeser began dealing in narcotics to support his lifestyle. In 1913, he was convicted of that charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. After serving 18 months, Loeser was paroled with the assistance of lawyer Louis Piquett and fled to Mexico upon his release. He was brought back to Chicago by Piquett in 1934 after having learned that a $10,000 bribe would allow him to return to the city permanently. In exchange, he agreed to perform cosmetic surgery on fugitive outlaws John Dillinger and Homer Van Meter. Both men wanted their faces altered and their fingerprints removed. Dillinger specifically wanted the removal of several facial scars and moles, a dimple in his chin and a depression on the end of his nose. Van Meter requested similar alterations as well as the removal of an anchor tattoo on his right arm. The outlaws paid up front, Piquett holding the money, and the surgery was performed at the home of Chicago mobster James Probasco from May 27‚Äì28, 1934. Assisted by Dr. Harold Cassidy, Loeser spent nearly 48 hours operating on Dillinger and Van Meter. Given the medical technology of the era and lack of hospital facilities, Loeser was limited in what he could do. He tightened Dillinger's cheeks using kangaroo tendons; however, Dillinger nearly suffocated to death during the operation when he swallowed his tongue under general anesthetic. A caustic solution was used to burn away both men's fingerprints; it apparently failed to erase them completely, however, as Dillinger would be identified by his fingerprints following his death two months later. His patients were both \\"mutilated and in agony\\" at the end of the surgery. As a result, the outlaws were extremely angry with Loeser. Van Meter allegedly threatened Loeser with his Tommy gun \\"clutched in bandaged hand\\", but was eventually persuaded to spare the doctor's life. With the surgery considered a failure, Loeser received only $5,000 from Piquett who kept the rest of the money himself. Arrest Two days after Dillinger was shot and killed by federal agents in Chicago, Loeser was arrested in Oak Park, Illinois. Loeser complained of police brutality following his arrest, claiming a beating by FBI agents smashed his nose all over his face, and friends observed \\"a significant change... in Loeser's appearance\\" while in federal custody. Loeser agreed to testify against Piquett. However, the defense attorney won a surprise appeal and Loeser was returned to prison for violating his parole from the decades-old narcotics charge. A clemency petition was filed in April 1935 which documented his arrangement with Melvin Purvis and Inspector Sam Cowley and he was released on September 21, 1935. That same day, his assistant Harold Cassidy received a year's probation for his part in the surgery.

Karl Evang (19 October 1902 ‚Äì 3 January 1981) was a Norwegian physician and civil servant. He was born in Kristiania as a son of assisting secretary Jens Ingolf Evang (1873‚Äì1914) and Anna Beate Wexelsen (1875‚Äì1954). He was a brother of Vilhelm Evang, and a relative of Vilhelm Andreas Wexelsen, Per Kvist and Gunnar Jahn. His sister Anne Beate married another civil servant, Karl Ludvig Bugge. Karl Evang met physician Gerda S. Landmark Moe (1905‚Äì1985) in 1926, and married her in 1929. He enrolled in medicine studies at the Royal Frederick University in 1924, and became a member of the revolutionary group Mot Dag in 1926 which had a strong standing among students. Mot Dag was affiliated with the Communist Party of Norway at the time, but soon became independent. Evang was also active in the Norwegian Support Committee for Spain and Clart√©. He was elected chairman of the Norwegian Students' Society in 1931, while serving a prison sentence for conscientious objection. He joined the Norwegian Labour Party after Mot Dag's demise in 1933. In the 1930s he became a noted public debater. He issued the 1934 book Rasepolitikk og reaksjon, and wrote with the purpose of medicinal and hygienic enlightenment in the publications Popul√¶rt Tidsskrift for Seksuell Oplysning (which he edited) and Arbeidermagasinet. He was also a popular radio speaker and lecturer. In 1938 he was appointed to the vacant position as director of the Norwegian Directorate for Health. When World War II came to Norway, Evang followed the cabinet Nygaardsvold first to Northern Norway, then to exile in the United Kingdom. Evang was given the rank of lieutenant colonel. He spent the war years organizing a health administration for Norwegians abroad, spending time in the USA as well. After the war he co- founded the World Health Organization; he was also board chairman for some time. His position was strengthened after the war, and Evang signalized technocratic ambitions. Similarly, the health conditions in Norway improved in the post-war years. Poliomyelitis was eradicated and tuberculosis diminished. However, several welfare programs were implemented long after Evang's initiatives. He also had political ambitions (Minister of Social Affairs, probably also Prime Minister) that were never fulfilled. In 1972 he had to retire due to the age limit of 70. He spent one year as a guest professor at the University of Troms√∏. He also became more radical politically. He had been an opponent of Norwegian participation in the Korean War and NATO, co-founded the newspaper Orientering and opposed Norwegian EEC membership in 1972.

Richetti, although he began drinking heavily at 14, was apparently uninvolved in criminal activity until his arrest for robbery in Crown Point, Indiana on August 7, 1928, two days after his 19th birthday. He was convicted and sentenced to serve 1 to 10 years at the Pendleton state reformatory, remaining there for two years, and paroled on October 2, 1930. He participated in his first bank robbery two years later when he joined Fred Hamner and brothers L.L. and W.A. Smalley in raiding a bank in Mill Creek, Oklahoma. During the getaway, Hamner was killed and the Smalley brothers were wounded and captured at the scene. Richetti, also wounded, was able to escape with $800. He managed to make it to Sulphur, Oklahoma before being arrested, only two hours after the robbery. On April 5, he was convicted of the robbery and sent to McAlester state prison. He spent four months in prison before being granted release under a $15,000 bond pending appeal of his conviction. Richetti quickly skipped bail and disappeared for several months. He finally reappeared on January 12, 1933, to rob a bank in Ash Grove, Missouri of $3,000. His partners in the heist were Edgar Dunbar and Aussie Elliott with whom he hid at his brother's home in Bolivar, Missouri. Sometime prior to this, Richetti met Pretty Boy Floyd who eventually became one of his closest confidants. The two became partners and, despite Richetti's worsening alcoholism, accompanied Floyd on a crime spree during the summer of 1933. They stole a car in Castle, Oklahoma on June 8 and together stole $1,638 from a bank in Mexico, Missouri six days later. That same afternoon, two police officers were killed near Columbia for which Richetti and Floyd were wrongly accused. Three days later, on June 16, the two men kidnapped Polk County Sheriff William Killingsworth from Bolivar, driving east in his brother's car (which he stole) until reaching Clinton, Missouri, where they commandeered another car and took its driver Walter Griffith hostage as well. Both Killingsworth and Griffith were released later that night at Lee's Summit near Kansas City. Unknown to either Richetti or Floyd, while they were driving across Missouri, bank robber Frank Nash was being transported by train from Arkansas to Kansas City where his partners attempted to free him from custody. A shootout resulted, referred to as the Kansas City Massacre, which left Nash and four of his guards dead. Eyewitness accounts were inconsistent and various men were identified in the aftermath including Harvey Bailey and Wilbur Underhill. Vernon Miller, a former sheriff turned outlaw, was identified as the ringleader but his accomplices remained unknown. Meanwhile, Richetti and Floyd struck again holding up a Galena bank for $3,000 on August 29. A month later, they rented an apartment in Buffalo, New York and moved in with their gun molls, sisters Rose Ash and Beulah Bird, on September 21. Despite the fact that there was nothing to link Richetti and Floyd to the shooting, the FBI identified them along with Miller as the triggermen on October 10, 1934. At the time of the announcement, the two were still living in Buffalo with their girlfriends. Floyd, by this time, had been elevated to \\"public enemy #1\\" for his alleged role in the Kansas City Massacre. The basis for Floyd's involvement was largely circumstantial. A .45-caliber cartridge shell found at the scene was later traced to one of Floyd's guns months after the shooting and questionable testimony from one of Miller's female associates, held incommunicado by the FBI and without legal representation, was enough to convict Floyd. As a well- known associate, it was assumed that Richetti had also taken part in the rescue attempt. Richetti is believed by most modern crime historians to have had no active role in the Kansas City Massacre, the most popular story being sleeping off an all-night drinking binge at the time the shooting began. After hearing the news, Richetti and Floyd fled Buffalo with their girlfriends on October 20. Heading for Oklahoma, their car broke down near Wellsville, Ohio after two days on the road. They sent the girls into town to get a tow truck and hid in the woods until their return. Their presence attracted the attention of local residents who called the police and arrested Richetti. Floyd managed to escape but was cornered by federal agents under Melvin Purvis near East Liverpool and gunned down two days later. Richetti was indicted for obstruction of justice on November 6, 1934, however that charge was held in abeyance when he was officially charged with murder by Missouri state officials for his alleged role in the Kansas City Massacre. During this time, Richetti was represented by Attorney Hugo Chestosky who fought against Richetti's extradition to Missouri. Chestosky doubted Richetti's role in the Kansas City Massacre based on his belief that the suspect had no involvement in the death of the officers. The Evening Review, 29 Oct 1934, Mon, Page 1 His trial began on June 13, 1935, during which time a number of eyewitnesses identified him and Floyd despite these witnesses having previously identified other suspects or had been unable to identify anyone at the time of the shooting two years earlier. Three days later, Richetti was found guilty of the murder of police officer Frank Hermanson and sentenced to death. His legal team appealed the court's decision but ultimately failed to get a new trial. Richetti was originally to be sent to the gallows but was instead executed in Missouri's newly constructed gas chamber on October 7, 1938.

Tere≈°ov lies approximately north-east of Rokycany, north-east of Plze≈à, and west of Prague.  History  The village is firstly mentioned in 1361.Liber primus confirmationum ad beneficia ecclesiastica Pragensem per archidioecesim nunc prima vice typis editus,inchoans ab anno 1354 usque 1362,Tomus primus,ed.

Jewish Community  Historically, Tere≈°ov had the oldest, as well as one of the most important Jewish communities in the Rokycany District, established already in 1623 (though some sources say even \\"a hundred years before that\\", i.e. 1520). Until the 19th Century, the Jewish Community of Tere≈°ov (\\"Israelitische Cultusgemeinde Tereschau\\") was the natural administrative and religious center for all the local small Jewish communities of the region, with a cemetery, a chevra kadisha, a rabbi, a cheder, a schochet, a mikvah and a synagogue. The synagogue has burned down and subsequently has been pulled down by the communist authorities in 1964. The Jewish Cemetery is still preserved till today, though in a somewhat mediocre condition; about 2 km NE from the village lies, next to the road to B√≠l√° Sk√°la, an area of approximately 4000 m2 with some 300 tombstones. Oldest tombstones date to 1725, newest ones into 1930's. The wall of the cemetery is in ruins, the cemetery is freely accessible.

History The first mention of the village comes from the year 1369. Silver and lead was mined in the vicinity of the village in Mies mining district. At the end of the 19th century the last mine, on the road to Unola (√önehle), was closed down. Until the abolition of the manorial system Kscheutz belonged to the manor of Trp√≠sty-T≈ôebel. The village had its own church, but was served by priests from Welperschitz (Erpu≈æice). After the Munich Agreement the village was annexed by the German Reich and belonged to the district of Mies until 1945. In 1939 324 people lived in Kscheutz. Between 1 July 1980 and 1 January 1992 K≈°ice was a district of St≈ô√≠bro . K≈°ice was created around a village square with a pond. The Assumption Church dominates the townscape.

It is one of the oldest villages in the formerly inaccessible mountain region, located on a trade route from the Kingdom of Bohemia into the Bavarian Upper Palatinate region. In the late 16th century, Paul Sch√ºrer from Saxony ran a glass factory at Zah√°j√≠ and in 1592 received the noble title von Waldheim from the hands of Emperor Rudolf II in his capacity as King of Bohemia. In 1607 Sch√ºrer purchased large estates in the remote area, which were colonised by German-speaking settlers, later referred to as Sudeten Germans. Incorporated into the Nazi Reichsgau Sudetenland from 1938 until the end of World War II, the German population was expelled after the war. Zah√°j√≠, ƒåesk√° Ves, and other villages immediately at the frontier with West Germany were abandoned and became a restricted zone.

Norton, and stars Holly Marie Combs and Sarah Chalke who play Alex and Annie, the two eldest daughters of the main character Anne. A possible movie adaptation of the true crime story was in talks since 1994, though Alex and Annie Morrell agreed only years later. Whereas they had no involvement in the production, and thought the film was overly dramatic, they supported the message and hoped that Daughters could help any victims of domestic violence. Plot In Spring 1989, sisters, Alex, and Anne Morrell, finish prep school and return home to start college. Their mother, publishing heiress Anne Scripps, welcomes them in her New York mansion. Anne has recently divorced her husband Tony, and is still struggling with the divorce. Nonetheless, she is happy with her new boyfriend, much younger Scott Douglas, a volatile-tempered young man whom she marries only months after their first meeting. From the start, Alex is uncertain if she should trust Scott, having heard stories about a possible violent past. When Anne announces that she will be having a baby, Scott is distrustful to notice how Alex reacts with doubt about the news. To get rid of her, he claims that he has found marijuana in Alex's bedroom. Alex denies the accusation, but Anne defends her boyfriend, who forces Alex to leave the house. Shortly after Anne and Scott's baby, Tori's, birth in June 1990, Scott gets violent and beats up Anne for inviting Tony's family for the baby's coming out party. Alex and Annie encourage their mom to leave Scott, but Anne forgives him after a couple of months. By June 1991, she and Scott are a happy couple again. On Alex's 21st birthday, Scott lashes out at Anne again when he finds her smoking in the same room as Tori, and then throws a guest, Stacey, off the stairs. Enraged, Alex dares Scott to hit her, and the police interrupts their fight, only to have Scott lie about the situation. A similar occurrence takes place at a formal ball, where Scott pushes around Anne in front of her friends. As they leave, the fight continues in the car, and Scott eventually throws her out while speeding. Three months later, Alex's charges against Scott have been dropped, though Anne has filed for divorce and attained a restraining order. The three women move on with their lives, until one night Annie is hit by her date, Mark, while Alex meets a new romantic interest, Jimmy Romeo, though a relationship is postponed due to her focus on her mother. Another setback occurs when Anne is informed that she will have to share custody of Tori. Deciding a reconciliation would be for the better, Anne meets with Scott and believes that he has changed his life for the better. It turns out, soon, however, that Scott is still as violent as he used to be and threatens to make Tori disappear if she does not stop continuing legal proceedings. The police arrive at the mansion sometime later, though Anne is too scared to file charges. The following day, upon finding out that Scott is stealing her money and planning on running away with Tori, Anne asks for another restraining order. Alex and Annie move in with her again to protect their mother from Scott, and until Alex leaves for the holidays, they are happy again. One day, Tony calls the mansion, and Scott answers. Believing that Anne will get back with Tony, he announces that the threats are over, and that something has to be done. As soon as Annie leaves, Scott gets drunk and grabs a hammer, killing Anne while she is asleep. Afterwards, he jumps to his death off the Tappan Zee Bridge, over the Hudson River in New York, though his body is found over three months later. The girls are left behind in grief over their mother. Fifteen months later, Alex prepares to marry Jimmy, and in the aftertitles, it is revealed that she gave birth to a baby daughter.

In 2011, Annie committed suicide, exactly the same way her mother's murderer killed himself, by jumping off the same bridge at the same spot. She left behind a suicide note apologizing to her son and to Alex for leaving.

An associate of Jim Clark, Ed Davis and other fellow Oklahoma bandits, he was a participant in countless bank robberies throughout Kansas and Oklahoma between 1917 and 1933. He was wrongfully imprisoned for a 1932 bank robbery in Fort Scott, Kansas and spent almost 40 years in prison before he was pardoned by Governor Robert Docking in 1969.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 273-274) Early life and criminal career James Sawyer was born near Durant, Oklahoma on May 1, 1899. Raised in a strict Baptist family, he was the fourth of nine children. However, he started getting into trouble as a teenager and, at age 17, started robbing banks with Jim Baldwin and Tom Slaughter. Sawyer was eventually thrown out and disowned by his parents after discovering stolen money from a then recent bank job. He eventually found work in the gambling halls of Wichita, Kansas. It was there that he met professional bank robbers Jeff Davis, Bud Maxwell and Henry Wells with whom he would take part in a string of bank robberies during 1917 and early-1918. Sawyer was then drafted into the U.S. Army but was discharged shortly after the Armistice and returned to Wichita where he became a professional gambler. He may have been connected to Al Spencer's gang, which robbed a large number of trains and banks during the early 1920s, but there is no conclusive evidence to support this claim. Sawyer was, however, responsible for killing two men in disputes over card games. The first was bank robber John Moore who he shot and killed after Moore accused of him of cheating. Afterwards, Sawyer briefly returned to his hometown where he shot a local card dealer named Bleaker whom he accused of cheating. Sawyer was arrested for the shooting in Dallas six months later and extradited back to Oklahoma where was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Arriving at the state penitentiary in McAlester on April 13, 1920, he was in prison for two years before escaping. It is unknown whether he was a member of the team that robbed a U.S. mail train of $20,000 on August 20, 1923, one which included Al Spencer, Frank Nash and several others, but several reports claim he was in the area where police and federal agents shot and killed Al Spencer near Bartlesville, Oklahoma a month later. Escape from McAlester and the Fort Scott robbery Sawyer was married that same year and although his wife tried to persuade him otherwise, he continued his criminal actives. He was arrested the following year shortly after his daughter was born and returned to McAlester to finish his sentence. On February 2, 1930, Sawyer was assigned to a prison work party assigned to paint the state capitol building in Oklahoma City and escaped after eluding careless guards. He remained around the capitol for another two years supporting himself by gambling and robberies. He was identified as one of the men who robbed a small bank in Union, Missouri on May 2, 1932. It was shortly after this heist that he teamed with Jim Clark and Ed Davis for a planned robbery in Rich Hill, Missouri but called it off, supposedly due to a case of bad nerves, quietly leaving the bank before drawing their pistols. They were arrested by police several hours later, caught in the dragnet searching for the men who robbed a bank in Fort Scott, Kansas that afternoon, and were taken in for questioning. One of those who accompanied the arresting officers, 17-year-old Stanley Butner, described the arrest. Although no evidence connected them to the robbery, they were all escaped convicts who were driving a stolen car. All three were indicted and wrongly convicted of the Fort Scott bank heist, in actuality committed by the Barker Gang, and sent to the state prison in Lansing. At least one account claims Sawyer was one of four outlaws recruited to rob the bank, referred to as a member of the \\"St. Paul Outfit\\", which included Harvey Bailey, Jim Clark and Ed Davis.Breuer, William B. J. Edgar Hoover and his G-Men. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995. (pg. 34, 50, 54) Escape from Lansing Sawyer and his partners escaped from Lansing less than a year later, joining a mass escape with eight other inmates on May 30, 1933. He and the others forced their way out using pistols,King, Jeffrey. The Life and Death of Pretty Boy Floyd. Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1999. (pg. 134) smuggled in by Frank Nash, and among whom included Harvey Bailey, Robert \\"Big Bob\\" Brady and Wilbur Underhill. Sawyer went off on his own after the group reached the Cookson Hills on June 4. A series of mishaps followed as Sawyer attempted to flee the area. He first attempted to hitchhike but eventually resorted to stealing a car at gunpoint. The motor of this first car died soon after and his second car blew a tire near Middleburg. He was forced to abandon yet another car when it began developing problems with the steering rod. He managed to steal a fourth car from a farm and drove it a little over six miles before it broke down just north of Gracemont. He hijacked another car but the driver purposely steered the car into a roadside ditch. Sawyer was eventually confronted near Chickasaw by Sheriff Horace Crisp and a deputy, then investigating the string of car thefts in the area, who was disarmed then knocked unconsciousness. Prison years and pardon Returned to McAlester to serve his sentence, he was transferred to the state reformatory in 1946 and the paroled to Kansas where he was then returned to Lansing and remained there for over two decades. Sawyer was finally pardoned by Governor Robert Docking on September 18, 1969, after a signed affidavit by Alvin Karpis cleared Sawyer of the 1933 Fort Scott robbery.\\"Ex-Public Enemy Submits Appeal For Jail Inmate\\".

He was known as \\"Andhra Nataka Pithamaha\\" and wrote more than 30 original plays. Early life He was born in Dharmavaram town in Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh in 1853 (Karthika Sudha Ekadasi). His parents were Krishnamacharyulu and Laxmidevamma; family name was Komanduru. He lost his father when he was 16 years of age and the family responsibility fell on his shoulders. After Matriculation, he worked for sometime in the Municipal High School and Adoni Taluk Office. He returned to Bellary and started practising as vakil in the Cantonment. He lost his wife soon after marriage and later married Laxmidevamma. He had passed first grade pleader's examination and F.A. in 1874. He had three brothers and three sisters. His sisters were Pedda Seshamma, Chinna Seshamma and Krishnamma. Pedda Seshamma was the mother of Bellary Raghava. His brothers were Dharmavaram Gopalacharyulu, Venkata Krishnamacharyulu and Seshacharyulu. Career During the famine between 1871-73 he and his friends established a society called Veera Sangam, to serve those affected. After the famine it was converted into a debating society. He initially wrote four short plays which were successful. In 1888, the society was replaced by the famous Sarasa Vinodini Sabha. Influenced by the success of Kannada dramas staged by Rajadhani Nataka Mandali in 1881, his brother Gopalacharyulu wrote a drama in Telugu and staged it. It did not made any impact to the public. Having felt insulted, Krishnamacharyulu wrote a drama himself in Kannada Swapna Niruddhamu and staged it in 1886. The drama impressed the public very much. There was an opinion that Telugu language was not suitable for drama format. He took up the partly written Telugu drama Chitra Naliyam and completed it. He directed the play and took the lead role on 29 January 1887. The play was successful, which helped combat the stigma against Telugu's use in playwrights. He wrote about 29 dramas successively and staged them with success. He introduced songs and poems in the drama. He took his troupe to Madras and staged his plays in 1891 at Victoria Public Hall. Pammal Sambandha Mudaliar, inspired by these dramas, established Suguna Vilas Sabha. He wrote about 90 dramas in Tamil and staged them. He was considered a modern Tamil Nataka Pithamaha. He recognized Ramakrishnamacharyulu as his Guru. Many of his plays were performed by the Surabhi Drama Troupe, the most noted one being Bhakta Prahlada which was made into a movie, the first Telugu talkie movie. Ramakrishna Vilas, a theatre building in Bellary named after Dharmavaram Ramakrishnamacharyulu, was the second theatre building in Bellary. This was later converted into a cinema theatre and renamed as Star Cinema.

Led by Richard Reese Whittemore (September 8, 1901 ‚Äì August 11, 1926), the gang went on a year-long crime spree committing payroll, bank and jewelry robberies in Maryland and New York before their capture in 1926.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 319-320) History Early years in Maryland Richard Whittemore, a longtime career criminal, escaped from the Maryland state penitentiary on February 20, 1925, after killing prison guard Robert Holtman. He reunited with his wife Margaret \\"Tiger Lil\\" Whittmore and began recruiting a team of stick up artists and hold up men such as Bernard Mortillaro, Pasquale Chicarelli, Joseph Ross, Morris \\"Shuffles\\" Goldberg, Leopold Gilden,New York Times Published: March 22, 1926 Anthony Paladino and brothers Jake and Leon Kramer. Whittemore and his gang would then commit a series of bank robberies in two states during a 12-month period. The gang committed its first armed robbery, only four days after Whittemore's prison escape, when they ambushed a Western Maryland Dairy payroll shipment in Baltimore. The driver and a guard were shot during the robbery and the gang escaped with $16,034 in cash. Three weeks later, the gang robbed Baltimore bank messenger J. Wahl Holtzman of $8,792 in broad daylight, beating him unconscious and then stealing the money he was carrying. Arrival in New York These robberies soon attracted the attention of authorities and Whittemore decided to move the gang to New York City where they could start again. On April 5, they robbed the Metro Sacks jewelry store on West 125 Street taking an estimated $16,000 in cash and precious stones. On May 9, the gang held up Manhattan jeweler Jacques Ross on Grand Street and took $25,000 in diamonds from him. A month later, they also hit Buffalo when, on June 1, they raided the Levy Jewelry Company and stole $50,000 worth of jewelry. Weeks later, they were back in Manhattan where they robbed Stanley's jewelry shop on July 16 escaping with another $50,000 in jewelry. On September 14, the gang stole a similar amount at David Brick's jewelry store on Third Avenue. On October 5, they stole an estimated $30,000 from Linherr's jewelry store on Sixth Avenue and, two weeks later, robbed salesman John Sandford, employed by Laster & Son, as he parked his car on Broadway. Whittemore and his gang got away with $25,000 worth of watches and jewelry. Buffalo hijacking and assaulting Spike Kenny On October 29, 1925, six unidentified gunmen hijacked an armored truck en route to the U.S. Federal Reserve. Once stopping the truck, they killed both the driver and guard then escaped with $93,000 in cash. The robbery made headlines across the country as Harry Harris and his gang were initially identified by witnesses. Eventually Whittemore was arrested on unrelated charges and became the prime suspect in this robbery. Dutch Andersonn was also named as a possible suspect, but the case eventually remained unsolved. Although it is unclear whether the Whittemore Gang was responsible for the Buffalo robbery, their leader made the news that same month for altogether different reasons when Whittemore allegedly attempted to kill bootlegger Edwin Spike Kinney. Whittemore confronted Kinney at a Baltimore roadhouse on Halloween, accusing him of having an affair with his wife Margaret, and shot him. Kinney later identified Whittemore as his assailant to police. Return to New York By the end of the year, the Whittemore Gang had returned to New York. On December 2, 1925, they stole $75,000 in diamonds from M.G. Ernest's jewelry store on Columbus Avenue. Three weeks later, they held up Nassau Street jeweler Folmer Prip for an estimated $10,000. On December 26, three days after their latest robbery, gang member Joe Ross was found shot to death in Elizabethtown, New Jersey in what is still an unsolved gangland slaying. The gang rested up for the next week or two before striking again. On January 11, 1926, they robbed Belgian diamond merchants Albert Goudris and Emanuel Veerman on West 48th Street in Manhattan. This was their most successful haul yet, having gotten $175,000 in gems, however this was also to be their last robbery. They spent the next nine weeks celebrating, spending much of their loot, According to federal watchdog Harry Anslinger, many, if not all, of the gang were using heroin by this time. Their drug use may have been the contributing factor for their capture when the New York Police Department were able to arrest eight of the surviving gang members on March 19, without firing a shot. Imprisonment and execution Whittemore was first tried in Buffalo for the armored car hijacking but the trial ended in a hung jury on April 27, 1926, and a mistrial was declared. Although the charges were dropped, Whittemore was extradited to Maryland where he was charged with the murder of prison guard Robert Holtman. He was convicted on May 21, condemned to death on June 10, and hanged on August 11, 1926. Two other members of the gang were convicted on robbery charges and sentenced to 40 years each in a New York prison.

When the farm failed, he and Gordon Alcorn began robbing banks in Canada and the United States. The two men eventually decided to try kidnapping and, in June 1932, they abducted Haskell Bohn in St. Paul, Minnesota. Bohn was the son of a local refrigerator magnate and they demanded $35,000 for his release, but instead settled for $12,000. Seven months later, they kidnapped Denver millionaire Charles Boettcher II and held them at Sankey's turkey ranch in South Dakota until they were paid $60,000. In a matter of months, Sankey and Alcorn were considered two of the most sought-after outlaws in the country. Their successful kidnappings were imitated by many in the Midwest underworld, such as the 1933 kidnapping of Charles Urschel by Albert Bates and George \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly. Ironically, it was the high-profile kidnappings of William Hamm, Jr. and Edward Bremer by the Barker Gang that led to their downfall. As the authorities were not yet aware of the existence of the Barkers, the kidnappings were blamed on Sankey and Alcorn, who were quickly tracked down by the FBI. On January 31, 1934, Sankey was captured by police and federal agents at a barber shop in Chicago, Illinois. He was returned to South Dakota to stand trial for the Boettcher kidnaping, being held at the state prison in Sioux Falls for added security; however, Sankey committed suicide before his trial by hanging himself in his cell with his necktie on February 8. Alcorn had been captured a week earlier and was sentenced to life imprisonment for Boettcher's kidnapping. References Further reading *Alix, Ernest Kahlar.

During the 1930s, he opened a gun store and saddlery shop at 111 S. Flores Street in San Antonio. Lebman was frequently asked by his customers to secure unusual weapons, including the Thompson submachine gun built by Colt, which at the time could be ordered through the mail and purchased at gun or hardware stores. Soon, Lehman began customizing Colt pistols and other small arms, including conversion into fully automatic weapons. One of his Lebman's specialties was the \\"Baby machine gun\\", a Colt Model 1911 semi-automatic pistol in .45 Automatic or .38 Super caliber, converted to full-auto fire. This machine pistol featured an oversized ammunition magazine, a muzzle brake or compensator, and a fore grip adapted from the more familiar Thompson submachine gun. Lebman's son Marvin described his father's development of the Colt \\"machine pistol\\" concept: > My father was Hyman S. Lebman (his name was not Harold, as quoted in the > article), and I worked with him from the time I was 10 years old (1937) > until he developed Alzheimers in 1976. He died in 1990. He told me many > stories about the customers who he later found out were John Dillinger and > Baby Face Nelson. He thought they were charming, wealthy, oil men who were > interested in guns, and even invited them to his house for his wife to make > them dinner when I was about 3 or 4. Our shop had a firing range in the > basement, and when he was experimenting with a Model 1911 on full automatic, > the 3rd or 4th round went off directly over head, through the floor, and I > was visiting above at the time. It scared him so much that he invented and > installed a compensator on the muzzle to control the recoil. At one time > much later, when I was visiting Washington, DC, I made an appointment with > the FBI, and they were happy to bring out their collection of my dad's guns > for me to see.Lebman, Marvin, \\"Letters to the Editor\\", Man At Arms, July > 2009, Volume 31, No. 4. Lebman continued to sell his machine pistols and other automatic weapons until the passage of the National Firearms Act in 1934. When Chicago bootlegger Roger \\"The Terrible\\" Touhy was arrested in Wisconsin on July 19, 1933, one of Lebman's \\"baby machine guns\\" was found in his car. Pretty Boy Floyd, John Dillinger, and several known associates of the Dillinger gang were also customers. A full-auto Lebman Colt belonging to Dillinger was found at one of his hideouts in St. Paul, Minnesota, on March 31, 1934, as well as one left behind at the Little Bohemia Lodge three weeks later. His most famous customer was perhaps Baby Face Nelson, whose earliest known purchase of weapons from Lehman occurred while visiting San Antonio in early 1933. Lebman, who always maintained that he knew nothing of his customers' gangster connections, did business with Nelson and the Dillinger gang for another year and a half. In November 1933, Lebman had Baby Face Nelson, Nelson's wife, and Nelson's henchman Homer Van Meter at his home for Thanksgiving. Less than two weeks later, Tommy Carroll was sent by Nelson to pick up a shipment from Lebman. Carroll was forced to turn back upon reaching San Antonio when, on February 11, 1934, he shot and killed Detective H.C. Perrow. A month later, Nelson used one of his special automatics to kill federal agent W. Carter Baum and seriously wound two others during the shootout with authorities at the Little Bohemia Lodge on April 22. Although this gun was never recovered, the FBI were able to trace the gun left behind by Dillinger by its serial number to the Colt factory in Hartford, Connecticut. From there, authorities followed the trail to a large Fort Worth pawn shop and firearms distributor, Wolfe & Klar, who sold the unmodified weapon to Hyman Lebman. There was no federal law against civilian ownership or manufacturing of machine guns at that time, and the National Firearms Act was passed only a few weeks later. Prosecutors did consider charging Lebman with possession of a .45 pistol given to him by another gangster that was later traced as stolen from a U.S. military armory, but could never establish that Lebman knew of the gun's actual origin. By furnishing the FBI with a trail of traceable and unusual weapons, Lebman's activities contributed to the eventual downfall of Nelson and several other gangsters. Lebman continued to face legal problems. He was tried for violation of a Texas state law passed in October 1933, which restricted possession of machine guns. Lebman was initially convicted of violating that law in 1935 and sentenced to five years imprisonment. He later won an appeal and his second trial resulted in a jury deadlock, and Lebman never served a day in prison. Federal prosecutors suspected jury tampering in the retrial, specifically with the lone holdout juror, but were never able to offer any evidence to support their suspicions. Despite a five-year effort to reopen the case, the Texas state attorney refused to hold a third trial. The case was eventually dismissed in 1941. In 1976, after developing Alzheimer's disease, Lebman retired from gunsmithing and stopped selling firearms, reportedly after pressure from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Lebman died in 1990. Lebman's son Marvin continued to sell custom leather boots, saddles, and Western wear from the Flores Street shop until the shop closed for good in 1995.

The Baronetcy of Twysden of Roydon Hall, Kent, was created on 29 June 1611 for William Twysden of Roydon Hall, East Peckham, Kent, the son of Roger Twysden, High Sheriff of Kent in 1599, and grandson of William Twysden of Chelmington and Wye who married Elizabeth Whetenhall, heiress of Roydon in 1542. Between 1593 and 1614 he served as Member of Parliament for Clitheroe, Helston, Thetford, and Winchelsea. His son and heir, Roger the second Baronet, was an ardent supporter of Charles I which caused him great problems during the Commonwealth of England. Both he and his son, William, the third Baronet served in Parliament.George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage, Volume 1 1900 The Baronetcy was extinct on the death of the twelfth Baronet in 1970. The Baronetcy of Twisden of Bradbourne, Kent, was created for Sir Thomas Twisden, Kt., of Bradbourne House, East Malling, Kent, on 13 June 1666. He was the second son of Sir William Twysden, 1st Baronet of Roydon and brother of the unfortunate Sir Roger Twysden. He changed the spelling of his surname to Twisden. He was a lawyer, Sergeant at Law, and a High Court judge who presided at the trial of regicides. He was Recorder of Maidstone and represented Maidstone in Parliament 1647-8. He purchased the manor of Bradbourne in 1656. The second and third Baronets respectively represented, Rochester and Kent. The fourth Baronet rebuilt Bradbourne House in the early 18th century. His brother the sixth Baronet also represented Kent. On the death of the sixth Baronet his next elder brother William was excluded from the succession in favour of his younger brother John Papillon Twisden who claimed to be the seventh Baronet and was succeeded by his son as eighth Baronet. On his death a legal dispute arose as to the succession, settled in favour of Captain John Twisden, son of the disinherited William. His son John Francis was reinstated as de jure seventh Baronet. The baronetcy was briefly in abeyance following the death in 1907 of the tenth Baronet without issue. The title was revived in 1909 for his uncle John Francis the eleventh Baronet.

Between 2011 and 2016 the brand was also used by TCCT Retail Limited, a travel agency run as a joint venture between the Thomas Cook Group, The Co-operative Group and Central England Co-operative. TCCT Retail was based at the Peterborough Business Park at Lynch Wood, Peterborough. It was a member of ABTA and held an ATOL licence; it also acted as an agent for licensed tour operators. In 2016, Thomas Cook completed a buy-out of The Co-operative Group and Central England Co- operative's 33.5% shareholding. The website closed in 2017 and all existing bookings were transferred to Thomas Cook. During 2017‚Äì18 Thomas Cook rebranded its The Co-operative Travel branches to the Thomas Cook name. Present Day Several co-operatives around the UK operate independent travel agents that make use of the Co-operative brand. The Midcounties Co-operative is the largest independent co-operative currently using the ‚ÄúCo-op Travel‚Äù brand within the UK, trading on and offline throughout the UK from their headquarters in Walsall. History The Co-operative Wholesale Society opened its first Excursion Department in 1905, to work with railways, steamers, and tour operators to get the best rates for co-operative society's excursions. In 1920, CWS arranged its first overseas excursion and published its first holiday guide. By the 1950s, the CWS Travel Service had become one of the five largest travel agencies in Britain and had begun to organise air travel for co-operative societies and their members.CWS Travel ‚Äì Travel Brochure The Co- operative Group, 25 June 2013 CWS Travel became known as Travelcare when the Co-operative Wholesale Society merged with Co-operative Retail Services in 2000 to form The Co-operative Group. The Co-operative Travel was formed by the integration of the Manchester-based Travelcare business with United Co- operatives' Co-op Travel subsidiary on the merger of the two societies in 2007.Top UK co-ops agree merger terms BBC News, 17 February 2007 03:29 GMT Joint venture A branch of The Co-operative Travel in Roundhay, Leeds, England in 2010 It was announced in 2010, that Co-op Group Travel 1 Ltd.Incorporated in 2011 and registered in England and Wales under the Companies Act 1985, No. 7413801 and Midlands Co-op Travel Ltd.Registered in England and Wales under the Companies Act 1985, No. 4132544 would merge with the retail branches of Thomas Cook Group. The joint venture did not include the latter's tour operating arm, which remained wholly within the Thomas Cook Group. The Co-operative Group, 8 October 2010 The new network was 66.5%-owned by Thomas Cook, 30%-owned by The Co-operative Group and 3.5%-owned by Central England Co-operative.Gosling, Paul What is the future of The Co-operative Travel? Co-operative News, 26 September 2013 Both chains retained their own branding, except for the small number of Thomas Cook's \\"Going Places\\" shops which were rebranded as The Co-operative Travel. The partnership arrangement helped to retain the heritage and ethics of The Co-operative brand and to ensure the consistency of message.The Co-operative Travel The Co-operative Group (retrieved 8 May 2013) The merger included the Co-operative's home- working division, Future Travel Limited, trading as \\"The Co-operative Personal Travel Advisors\\".

The Office of Fair Trading requested a referral from the European Commission and, in turn, referred the case to the Competition Commission in March 2011. In July 2011, it was announced that the Competition Commission raised no objections to the merger.Competition Commission approves Thomas Cook and Co-operative Travel merger Travel Weekly, 21 July 2011 As a result of the merger, the business became part of the Thomas Cook Group. In 2016 the Co-operative Group decided that having a minority stake in a travel business no longer fit with its strategy and said that it would exercise its option to quit the joint venture. Thomas Cook announced it would buy out the stakes owned by The Co-operative Group and Central England Co-operative, taking full control of the retail network and rebranding the high street travel stores that had operated under the Co-operative brand gradually during 2017‚Äì18. Thomas Cook's UK travel agencies were sold to Hays Travel in 2019 after Thomas Cook had been liquidated. While it was involved in the joint venture, Central England Co- operative continued to operate a network of Co-operative Travel branches which were managed separately from Thomas Cook. This arose from the 2013 merger of the Midlands Co-operative Society which had joined the venture and the Anglia Regional Co-operative Society which continued to operate its travel branches independently. Operations The Co-operative Travel offered package holidays, city breaks, hotels, flights, cruises and skiing holidays to a wide range of destinations.

He was also associated with Frank \\"Jelly\\" Nash, Volney Davis and the Barker-Karpis Gang in his early career. Green was considered a highly intelligent criminal and expert \\"jug marker,\\" widely known to employ tactics such as casing banks and planning escape routes that he drove prior to a robbery to ensure a perfect getaway. His connections with corrupt politicians and police officials in St. Paul, Minnesota made him extremely useful in setting up safe houses and provide warning from police raids.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 121-122) Biography Early life Eugene Green, born in 1898, lived in Pueblo, Colorado, with his mother and brothers James and Frank, their father having died when Eddie was three. The following is the criminal record of Edward Green, aliases Eugene Green, George Graham, Charles Ryan, George Green, Fred Rogge, and Frederick Riley: *As Eugene Green, arrested August 11, 1916, by the Milwaukee Police Department, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; charge grand larceny.

Released. *As Eddie Green, he was received at the state reformatory, St. Cloud, Minnesota, November 15, 1922 Charged with robbery first degree, he was convicted and sentenced 40 years, serving 5 years. As Eddie Green, he was received at the Minnesota State Prison, Stillwater, Minnesota, July 26, 1923, on a transfer from the state reformatory.FBI Dillinger File 62-29777, Cowley memo Major career After his parole, he occasionally worked in iron mills while becoming a skilled \\"jug marker,\\" someone who chooses which bank to rob. Green took part in his first major bank robbery on January 28, 1933, when he joined Earl Doyle, Thomas \\"Buck\\" Woulfe and \\"Dago\\" Howard Lansdon in robbing a bank messenger in North Kansas City of $14,500. During the robbery, a shootout occurred that left Marshal Edgar Nall and Woulfe wounded. The gang later battled a pursuing posse, largely made up of local residents, and escaped by stealing one of their cars. Green and his partners fled to Iowa where they stole spare license places from two vehicles and kidnapped two Knoxville police officers, Burt Conrey and John Neuman, before returning to Missouri. Releasing the hostages in Unionville on January 29, they also dropped off Woulfe who was arrested at a hospital in Coffeyville, Kansas four days later. Woulfe, who had been shot in the groin, died soon after being transferred to the county jail in Liberty, Missouri. Three months later, Green joined Jess Doyle, Earl Christman, Frank \\"Jelly\\" Nash, Volney Davis, brothers Arthur and Fred Barker and Alvin Karpis to rob a bank in Fairbury, Nebraska on April 4, 1933. Christman was badly wounded during the robbery and Green drove him to Verne Miller's house in Kansas City to recover. Christman eventually died from his wounds and was buried in an unmarked grave outside town. Green eventually became displeased with the tactics used by the Barker brothers, and began to seek a new gang, resurfacing as an associate of Baby Face Nelson, late in 1933 and early 1934, along with Tommy Carroll, and Homer Van Meter, and later became a member of the reorganized John Dillinger gang in early 1934. His first robbery with the group, then including Dillinger, Tommy Carroll, Homer Van Meter and Baby Face Nelson, was on March 6 when they held up a bank in Sioux Falls, South Dakota for $49,500. Green also provided the gang with an extra gunman, Tommy Carroll. One motorcycle cop, Hale Keith, was hit four times in the chest when Nelson shot him through a plate glass window. A week later in Mason City, Iowa, despite casing the bank with Van Meter beforehand at an estimated $250,000 and using a series of diagrams and planned getaway routes made by Green, the gang grabbed only $52,000, taking 25 hostages to make their getaway possible. Both Dillinger and John \\"Red\\" Hamilton were wounded in their shoulders, as well as an innocent bystander that Nelson mistook for a cop, during their escape. Death Returning to St. Paul, Green provided a safehouse for Dillinger and Van Meter. However, the FBI had been on Dillinger's trail for some time, as they were for many Depression-era outlaws, and were getting close to capturing him. On March 31, federal agents raided the hideout and surprised the three, who managed to escape after an ensuing shootout. Dillinger was wounded in the escape and, while Green arranged for medical treatment in Minneapolis, the FBI came up with a lead on Dillinger's benefactor. When investigators were searching Dillinger's abandoned apartment, they discovered a telephone number which they traced to one of Green's hideouts in St. Paul. Green and his common-law wife Bessie turned up at the safehouse on April 3. Green left the car and proceeded to enter the apartment when he was ambushed by federal agents, armed with Thompson machine guns, and was shot in the head and shoulder. The FBI defended its actions, amid conflicting reports that Green had either attempted to flee or was gunned down in cold blood, claiming that Green \\"assumed a threatening attitude ... accompanied by menacing gestures.\\" The FBI would receive heavy criticism from the press in regards to the death of an unarmed suspect, which slowed their investigation of Dillinger. Green was taken to a hospital in St. Paul where he died from his wounds seven days later. He was delirious for the week before his death, allowing federal agents to record every word he said. Among the information they were able to gain included revealing the existence of the Karpis-Barker Gang, whom they were able to capture within 10 months. His wife, then held in custody for harboring her husband, told the police the names of Dillinger's gang upon her husband's death. She also confirmed that the Karpis-Barker gang was responsible for the January 1934 kidnaping of Edward Bremer, and named all of the gang members along with their girlfriends, leading to the issuing of federal indictments against them.

In the 1934 conspiracy trial all of the defendants took the stand, except Deafy Farmer; he was so deaf, his wife said, that questioning him would be useless. In 1933 he was described to the FBI as \\"a very dangerous man, a killer, and his best known line is the con game.... his favorite weapon being the knife.\\"FBI File 62-28915, Part 04, pp. 88-9. Farmer served two years in Alcatraz for his participation in the conspiracy to free Jelly Nash. After his release he returned to Missouri. He and Esther sold the farm and moved into Joplin, where they lived until his death on January 12, 1948. In October 1966 Esther married Harvey Bailey, \\"dean of the American bank robbers,\\" after a year-long courtship. She died in 1981. Role in the Kansas City Massacre conspiracy Background Federal agents had been on the trail of Jelly NashHe was nicknamed \\"Jelly\\" because he was a safe-blowing expert, FBI File Part 09, p. 51; \\"jelly\\" was jelly powder, an explosive made by combining nitroglycerin and colloidion cotton, which mixture resembled calf's-foot jelly. for three years, since his escape from the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas in 1930. At noon on June 16, 1933, Nash was finishing a beer inside the White Front cigar store and pool hall on the main street of Hot Springs, Arkansas when two special agents of the Department of Justice and the police chief of McAlester, Oklahoma grabbed him, hustled him into a waiting car and drove away. Their goal was to get Nash from Hot Springs back to Leavenworth to finish his sentence for armed robbery. Dick Galatas, owner of the White Front and \\"the official representative of the gangster world in Hot Springs,\\"\\"[Galatas]... gets orders from the head of a big criminal organization in Chicago... it is Galatas's duty to arrange for and afford protection for gangsters sent to Hot Springs to cool off or for other purposes.\\" Galatas was the \\"boss of a slot machine racket\\" in Hot Springs, in partnership with the mayor. FBI File 62-28915, Part 02, p. 101; Part 04, pp. 85-90. went directly to the police station in City Hall to the office of Dutch Akers, chief of detectives. Dutch Akers was deeply entangled with the racketeering operations of Hot Springs and at the same time was an informant for the FBI. It was he who, that morning, had notified his contact that Nash was in Hot Springs and at the White Front.FBI File Part 10 p. 91. Akers specifically asked that agents apprehend Nash anywhere but the White Front. Akers began calling every police station between Hot Springs and Little Rock to report that a visiting businessman named George Miller‚Äîthe name Nash went by around townNash had been putting together an identity as George W. Miller of Chicago for a year. He had grown a mustache and wore a toupee and glasses, and had had plastic surgery to change the shape of his nose. He and Frances had married a few weeks before, under the name Miller, and he had acquired a forged union card and Masonic lodge card to use as identification. FBI File 62-28915, Part 06. At their conspiracy trial the defendants protested that they had known the couple only as the Millers, and Galatas said that getting Mrs. Miller to Joplin was only a sympathetic gesture to try to aid the family of a brother Mason. King p. 113.‚Äîhad been kidnapped. He and Galatas left the police station around 1 p.m. and Galatas went to collect Jelly Nash's wife Frances. In Benton, Arkansas, halfway to Little Rock, the agents' car was halted by a police roadblock: \\"three men with rifles and sawed-off shotguns.\\" They were stopped again at the edge of Little Rock by \\"two police cars with riot guns.\\"FBI File 62-28915, Part 03, p. 9. The agents and Nash were aware that the stops were delay tactics. \\"I hope we make it out of this state alive,\\" Nash said, cryptically.Though speculation arose that the true purpose of the Kansas City Massacre had been to get rid of Jelly Nash, most FBI informants were of the opinion that his death was accidental. One pointed out that Nash \\"was in good standing with all the big shots, if they had wanted to put him on the spot they would have done it before he was arrested in [Hot Springs]. It was accidental that he was killed while they were trying to liberate him.\\" FBI File 62-28915, Part 03. At 2:34 p.m., from Galatas's house in Hot Springs, Chief Akers called the Little Rock police station. The officer in charge explained that there had been no kidnapping, that a fugitive was simply being returned to prison. The officer told Akers that the car had turned west at Little Rock, onto \\"the Joplin road.\\"FBI File 62-28915, Part 13 p. 60; Part 11, p. 70. Until then Akers and Galatas had not been certain who had taken Nash, or where they were going. Galatas had brought Frances Nash to a neighbor's house to make phone calls. At 2:50 p.m., at Galatas's direction Mrs Nash called nightclub owner Louis \\"Doc\\" Stacci in Chicago. Stacci's subsequent phone calls to Fritz Mulloy, a friend of Verne Miller's in Kansas City, drew Miller into the plan to free Nash. Mrs Nash called Esther Farmer in Joplin. Thirty minutes west of Little Rock the agents stopped in the town of Conway and called Ralph Colvin, the special agent in charge in Oklahoma City who had given the go-ahead to apprehend Nash, and let him know they were being tracked. Colvin told them to proceed to Fort Smith and call again from there. The agents had left the Little Rock officers \\"with the impression that we were proceeding to Joplin, Mo., but at a given point we left the Joplin road and dropped into Fort Smith.\\"FBI File 62-28915, Part 03, p. 14. Galatas and Frances Nash hired an airplane to fly Frances and her young daughter to Joplin. Mrs. Nash was afraid to fly in the Ryan B-1 monoplane. Galatas tried to calm her fears by telling her it was just like The Spirit of St. Louis, but she insisted he come with her. They arrived in late afternoon, at 6:20 p.m. Deafy Farmer met them and drove them to his farm.FBI File 62-28915, pp. 93-5. At about the same time Galatas and Frances Nash arrived in Joplin, the federal agents arrived in Fort Smith and called Colvin. He told them to abandon the car and catch the 8:30 p.m. train to Kansas City. Colvin then called Reed Vetterli, the special agent in charge at Kansas City, and told him the new information. Shortly after Colvin and Vetterli spoke, \\"Mrs. Galatas called Galatas on the telephone and advised him that Nash was not to be brought to Joplin, but that the federal men were taking him from Fort Smith, Ark., by train \\"on in.\\" By the time the agents and their handcuffed charge arrived at the station platform, their secret had already reached the press wires,FBI Part 13 p. 55. A United Press story that Jelly Nash would arrive at the Union Station at 7:15 a.m. ran in the Kansas City morning editions on Saturday, June 17. In the wake of the shootings the breach of secrecy precipitated letters from an aghast public to J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI, scolding the Bureau for having caused the tragedy through self-aggrandizing publicity. Hoover wrote back stiffly to each, saying the news had been leaked. FBI File 62-28915, Part 02. and \\"at 8:46 p.m., 8 minutes after the train pulled out of Ft. Smith, a phone call was made from Ft. Smith to [Mrs. Nash's neighbor's house in] Hot Springs.\\"FBI File 62-28915, Part 13 p. 66. Joplin Around 9 p.m. Farmer and Galatas left the farm and drove into Joplin. \\"Galatas and Farmer went down town for the avowed purpose of seeing if they could find out if Nash had been brought to Joplin, saying that they would do what they could to get Jelly back to his wife; but when they returned, they reported that he was not in town.\\" Galatas called his wife in Hot Springs from Frank Vaughn's Midway Drugstore in town at 9:37 p.m. \\"It is apparent Galatas and others... were making plans up to that hour to have appropriate assistance at Joplin to release Nash; that was evidently the reason why [Stacci] at Chicago was trying to reach Miller and the reason [Galatas and Mrs. Nash] flew to Joplin.\\"FBI File 62-28915, Part 11, p. 7; Part 13, p. 64. It's not known what Galatas and Farmer intended to do if they saw Nash and his escorts at Joplin, nor whether they considered boarding the train, nor whether they were watching alone. \\"At 10:09 pm the Hot Springs number [which had received the 8:46 call from Fort Smith] called Farmer's house.\\"FBI File 62-28915, Part 07, p. 59. At 10:17 p.m., Esther Farmer called Verne Miller's house in Kansas City and spoke to Miller's girlfriend, Vivian Mathias. \\"Mrs. Farmer was heard to say over the telephone on June 16th: 'They got by us here at Joplin. We watched from every angle but they got by us.'\\"Galatas v. United States, 80 F.2d 15 (8th Cir. 1935). Loislaw At 12:05 a.m. June 17, Verne Miller called Herb Farmer's house from Union Station, Kansas City. Galatas told him what time the train would arrive at Union Station. Miller's phone calls earlier that evening were first to John Lazia in Kansas City, then to associates in Chicago and New York and to Harry Sawyer's Green Lantern restaurant in St. Paul to try to interest the Karpis-Barker gang, but on such short notice he could find no out-of-town takers (the Barkers were occupied at the time with the Hamm kidnapping) and the Kansas City mob did not want to get involved. At 6 a.m. June 17, Deafy Farmer drove Galatas and the aviator from the Connor Hotel in Joplin back to the airport, and returned home.FBI File 62-28915, Part 02, p. 102. Dutch Akers later told his FBI contact that as soon as Galatas reached Hot Springs \\"he ordered every gangster in town to leave.\\" At 9:51 a.m. a call was made from a pay phone in Hot Springs to the Farmers' house. When the Joplin police chief heard the news of the shootings at Union Station he immediately suspected Herb Farmer had something to do with it. He and detectives arrived at the farm at noon, but the Farmers and Mrs. Nash had fled. Arrest and trial Farmer went to Kansas City. He spent several days gambling in the Majestic Hotel, then returned to the farm. In hiding and out of money,Harvey Bean he traded chickens for groceries with a family friend, bootlegger Frank Vaughn. In early July Vaughn urged him to give himself up. Farmer said he would when the weather turned cooler, that he hated to be in jail in such hot weather. When Farmer received his phone bill on July 8 and saw the long distance record for June 16, he sent Esther to the Joplin police station to tell Chief of Police Ed Portley that he would like to speak with him. Portley came out and arrested him at home. Esther Farmer came to visit her husband in the jail and was arrested there.FBI File 62-28915, Part 08, p. 123. Frances Nash was arrested July 11 in Illinois. Galatas eluded apprehension until September 22.Liberty magazine had offered a reward for Galatas's capture and reprinted an enlarged mugshot in its September 15, 1934 issue. His face was recognized by an alert reader and he was arrested in New Orleans. Harris, Richard G. \\"A Mad Dog Is Caught!\\" Liberty, Nov. 17, 1934, reprinted in Liberty, Spring 1972, p. 28. The warrant for Galatas's arrest charged that he had \\"conspired to cause the escape of Frank Nash at Joplin, Missouri.\\"FBI File 62-28915, Part 08, p. 60. Deafy Farmer and his wife, Dick Galatas and his wife, Frances Nash, Vivian Mathias, Doc Stacci of Chicago and Fritz Mulloy of Kansas City were indicted by a federal grand jury in Kansas City on October 24, 1934, and charged with three counts of conspiracy to aid \\"the escape of [a federal] prisoner properly committed to the custody of the Attorney General.\\"Galatas v. United States. Vivian Mathias pleaded guilty and also testified for the government. The names of Verne Miller, Adam Richetti, and Louise Connor, the neighbor in Hot Springs whose phone had been used, were included in the original October indictment. Verne Miller was murdered in November. Adam Richetti's indictment was held back in anticipation that the state of Missouri would secure a murder conviction against him. Louise Connor's name was dropped. At the close of evidence counts two and three ‚Äî conspiracy to harbor a federal prisoner and conspiracy to rescue a federal prisoner ‚Äî were dropped.\\"Verdict Delayed in Kansas City Slaying of Five.\\" UP, unknown newspaper, Jan. 3, 1935. Mrs Nash testified for the government and charges against her were dismissed. The rest were convicted on the remaining count, conspiracy to free a federal prisoner, on January 4, 1935.\\"While the jury deliberated, some of the defendants frolicked like boys released from school. Louis Stacci, caf√© proprietor, chased Herbert Farmer, gambler, about the courtroom, pointing a camera in a mock attempt at taking his picture.\\" \\"Verdict Delayed in Kansas City Slaying of Five.\\" UP, unknown newspaper, Jan. 3, 1935. The flurry of phone calls on June 16 and early June 17, their times and connections, were the basis of the prosecution's case. They were also the basis of the defense's case. The maximum penalty for conspiracy was two years and a fine of $10,000; all four men were assessed the maximum and all four were remanded to Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary. Farmer, Galatas and Mulloy were later transferred to the new federal prison in California, Alcatraz. The three women were sentenced to three years' probation and fined $5,000 each.\\"Union Station Gang Sentenced.\\" UP, Palm Beach Daily News, Jan. 5, 1935.

He led a small gang during the 1940s and 1950s, Dunn becoming referred to by the press as \\"the modern John Dillinger\\", and whose activities eventually resulted in his being listed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted in 1958.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 90-91) Biography Early life and criminal career Born in 1905, Frederick Dunn's criminal career began when he was convicted of breaking and entering and larceny at the age of 14. He was sent to the Iowa Training School for Boys at Eldora, Iowa and remained there for five years, being paroled in 1921, and eventually discharged in 1924. Two months after leaving the school, he was arrested with two others for attempting to burglarize a general store in Gayville, South Dakota. The owner confronted Dunn and his two partners, firing at them with a gun and hitting one of the would-be robbers in the eye, with Dunn and his wounded friend being arrested by police. The two were convicted of burglary in November of that year and sentenced to five years in South Dakota state prison. Dunn was released on parole in 1927 but was returned to prison a year later following his arrest in Omaha for a parole violation. Robbery in Sioux City He was released in August 1929 and linked to a bank robbery in Salix, Iowa after only a few weeks. In Sioux City, three weeks later, he and a masked accomplice robbed a store on the outskirts of town. Upon entering the store, Dunn fired a shot into the ceiling and escaped with $67. Early the following year, he and another man robbed a suburban bank also near Sioux City. In February 1930, Dunn was picked up in Chicago and returned to Iowa for trial. Ten days after his arrival in Sioux City, Dunn managed to obtain a smuggled pistol and escaped with another inmate. One of the guards was shot in the thigh when he attempted to stop Dunn. Managing to elude authorities for a few hours, Dunn was confronted by police later that day. He was surprised by sheriff's deputies in a nearby alley and surrendered after a brief shootout. Dunn was eventually given a 40-year prison sentence for bank robbery as well as an additional 30 years for \\"assault with intent to kill\\" as a result of his escape attempt. He was sent to the Iowa state prison in Fort Madison in March 1930 where he remained until his parole in June 1940. Crime spree in Kansas Dunn quickly returned to crime and, within two years, was being referred to as a \\"modern-day [John] Dillinger\\" for his skill in using nitroglycerine in blowing open safes. On July 2, 1942, he and two others robbed $2,861 from a bank in Portis, Kansas. Although they locked everyone in the vault, one of the bank owners, Carl Thomas, managed to get free and grabbed a rifle which he used to wound one of the robbers as they made their getaway. They later lost the car outside town when the driver suddenly swerved and sent the car rolling over several times. A second getaway car was nearby allowing Dunn and the others to escape. Less than three weeks later, Dunn and his partners were arrested by federal agents in Denver, Colorado on July 21, 1942. He and the rest of his gang were convicted on federal charges and received 15 years. Two women associated with the gang were also charged as accessories and sentenced to six years each. Prior to sentencing, hacksaw blades were found in Dunn's cell and he later confessed to planning a jail break. The \\"Modern Dillinger\\" and the FBI Dunn was imprisoned in Leavenworth federal penitentiary in Kansas and spent a decade there until his parole in November 1952. Within seven months, an arrest warrant was issued for a parole violation. He was found living in Kansas City in January 1954 and arrested on a weapons charge. He was brought back to Leavenworth to complete his sentence. Dunn was finally released on August 16, 1957. He was accused of burglarizing a store in Westphalia, Iowa, but no charges were brought against him. He was, however, arrested in Russell, Kansas on November 21 in connection with another burglary in nearby Palco. He was indicted on that charge six days later and transferred to the county lockup in Lincoln. While awaiting trial for the burglary of a grocery store in Sylvan Grove, he escaped from custody on January 11, 1958. The FBI put out an arrest warrant charging him with \\"unlawful flight to escape prosecution\\" five days later and, on July 29, officially added him to the FBI Top Most Wanted. Their investigation soon ran cold, however, Dunn seemingly having disappeared. It was presumed by authorities that he had fled the state after his escape. On September 7, 1959, his skeletal remains were found near Ellsworth and confirmed by a post-mortum examination two weeks later. With Dunn not having left Kansas after all, there was some speculation that he had committed suicide, but the cause of death was ultimately ruled as murder.

In addition to finding volunteers to join, it is also responsible for preparing them for United States Marine Corps Recruit Training or Officer Candidates School. History With the founding of the Corps in 1775, the first recruiting drive was held at Tun Tavern in Philadelphia. At the time, the recruiting of volunteers was the responsibility of the various barracks commanders scattered throughout the United States to guard naval installations and man ships. Recruiting posters through to the American Civil War promised prospective recruits of bounties and prizes for service at sea. After the end of the draft in the United States in 1972, recruiters had to shift from merely processing recruits to actively seeking and encouraging them to join an all- volunteer force. Because there are Marine installations in relatively few states, Marine recruiters are typically the public face of the Corps, seen most commonly by the civilian population. Recruiting Recruiters serve as the entry into the Corps through a variety of means. While the majority of accessions are enlisted, those who qualify can attempt to earn a commission and become an officer. All potential recruits are screened by recruiters for physical standards and fitness, adequate education (a high school diploma or equivalent, such as a GED for enlisted, and a bachelor's degree for officers), lack of significant civil convictions, lack of significant drug use, and other qualifiers. The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is administered to determine qualifications for a job field (known as a Military Occupational Specialty).ASVAB official website Enlisted Marines who qualify and successfully process through a Military Entrance Processing Station can ship to recruit training. Recruits from the 1st, 4th, and 6th Marine Corps Districts will attend Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, while males from the 8th, 9th, and 12th will attend Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego. All enlisted females attend recruit training at Parris Island, regardless of district.Marine Corps Order 1510.32D. Recruit Training 25 Aug 2003 Officers can be sourced from several veins: Officer Selection by Recruiting Stations, Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps, and enlisted commissioning. The vast majority will train at Officer Candidates School, but some will attend the Naval Academy instead. Structure Map of the Recruiting Districts For the purposes of recruiting Marines, the United States is divided into two regions. The Eastern Recruiting Region mostly covers districts east of the Mississippi River. The Western Recruiting Region predominately covers districts west of the Mississippi. The two regions are divided into three districts each, each comprising several states. These are subdivided into Recruiting Stations (RS) located in large metropolitan areas, with smaller Recruiting Sub-Stations (RSS) covering smaller cities and rural areas. Some Recruiting Sub-Stations (RSS) have even smaller satellite offices called Permanent Contact Stations (PCS) often manned by a single Recruiter. The Marine Corps Recruiting Command has approximately 3,000 recruiters operating out of 48 Recruiting Stations, 574 Recruiting Sub-Stations, and 71 Officer Selection Sites across the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Guam. 1st Marine Corps District The 1st Marine Corps District covers the northeast United States, including New England.1st Marine Corps District official website It is the only District within the Marine Corps Recruiting Command to command an installation.

It is produced monthly in print and digital formats. The editorial content of Electronics World covers the full range of electronics and RF industry activities including technology, systems, components, design, development tools, software, networking, communications tools and instrumentation. It encompasses a range of issues in the electronics and RF industry, from design through to product implementation. The features are contributed by engineers and academics in the electronics industry. The circulation is split between electronic design engineers, senior managers, and R&D; professionals within areas such as communications, manufacturing, education and training, IT, medical, power, oil and gas.  History  The Marconi Company published the first issue of the journal The Marconigraph in April 1911. This monthly magazine was the first significant journal dedicated to wireless communication, and it circulated largely among Marconi engineers and operators. In April 1913, after two years and 24 issues, The Marconigraph was superseded by The Wireless World. An Illustrated Monthly Magazine for all interested in Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony as its first issue was sold on news-stands. Publication of Wireless World continued uninterrupted throughout World War I, and from 4 April 1920 (vol. 8 no. 1) publication frequency was increased to fortnightly From 1 April 1922 it became known as The Wireless World and Radio Review following a merger with The Radio Review, a monthly journal that had first been published in London in October 1919. With the same issue, publication frequency of Wireless World became weekly. It was also aimed at home constructors, publishing articles on building radio receivers and, after the BBC started regular 405-line TV programmes from Alexandra Palace in 1936, complete details on building your own TV set - including the winding of the high-voltage CRT deflector coils (not a task for the faint hearted). A similar series was published after 1945 utilising the then ubiquitous EF50 RF pentode amplifier valve (tube). With the outbreak of World War II and the expected shortages of paper and other resources, the publication reverted to being monthly, a frequency that it still retains to this day. The title was changed in September 1984 to Electronics and Wireless World, and from January 1996 (vol 102, no. 1718), to Electronics World. A sister publication was Wireless Engineer which was more of a learned journal than a popular magazine, featuring high quality, technical articles.  Notable articles  Geosynchronous satellites In Wireless World s October 1945 issue, Arthur C. Clarke (then of The British Interplanetary Society) published a now-famous article, \\"Extra Terrestrial Relays\\", which foresaw the coming of communications satellites in synchronous orbit around the Earth. Clarke pointed out that three satellites in the equatorial plane orbit at an altitude of 36,000 km, spaced 120 degrees apart, could provide global communications. The altitude is crucial as there a satellite rotates at the same angular velocity as the surface of the Earth, and therefore remains above a particular point on its surfacethat is, it is geostationary. The article is now seen as the origin of modern satellite communications, and the geostationary earth orbit is sometimes referred to as Clarke's Orbit.  Audio and electronic design  A 1949 Williamson amplifier built to the design in Wireless World. For decades, Wireless World was a place where pioneers in audio and electronic design shared ideas. In 1947-49, it published articles on building what became the famous \\"Williamson amplifier\\" by D.T.N Williamson - using a pair of triode-connected KT66 kinkless power tetrodes (very similar to the American 6L6) in push-pull to give 15 watts output. In 1952 it made the first public announcement of the Baxandall tone control circuit, a design now employed in millions of hi-fi systems including amplifiers and effects for musical instruments. In 1955 it published the design of the popular Mullard 5-10 audio amplifier using two EL84 power pentodes in ultra-linear push-pull configuration. In the 1960s and 1970s there were many further articles on advances in audio and electronic design, notably all-transistor designs including the 'Tobey-Dinsdale Amplifier'R Tobey & J Dinsdale, \\"Transistor Audio Power Amplifier\\": Wireless World for November 1961, pp. 565-570; see also Wireless World for February 1962, pp. 69-70. (The authors of this very successful design acknowledged H C Lin's earlier design of a quasi-complementary transistor amplifier configuration, for which see US Patent 2,896,029 for \\"Semiconductor Amplifier Circuits\\", to H C Lin, issued 21 July 1959, filed 3 May 1955.) and the 'Linsley Hood' power amplifier. In the December 1975 edition an article described ‚Äúfeed-forward‚Äù error correction for audio amplifiers as embodied in the legendary QUAD 405 current dumping power amplifier designed by Peter Walker and M. P. Albinson. In 1975/6 Wireless World published the design of a decoder of broadcast TV Teletext information before the first commercial decoder became available. Later it published regular columns of brief Circuit Ideas.  Computers  In the August to December 1967 editions a series, Wireless World Digital Computer by Brian Crank, was published. It described how to build a \\"very\\" simple binary computer at home. It was constructed entirely from \\"reject\\" transistors (functional, but not meeting all specifications, consequently sold cheaply), and was intended for teaching the basic principles of computer operation. In 1977 a series of articles was published based on the design of the NASCOM 1 computer. In 1979 they published a design by John Adams for a dual-processor desktop computer which included a novel high-level programming language. Entitled \\"A scientific computer\\", it was marketed as the PSI Comp 80 in kit form by the company Powertran.  Contributors  Contributors included M.G. Scroggie, who contributed articles of an educational nature on subjects such as applied mathematics and electronic theory using the pen name \\"Cathode Ray\\". \\"Free Grid\\" was the pseudonym of Norman Preston Vincer-Minter (1897‚Äì1964), a classicist and ex-naval wireless operator who specialised in deflating pomposity with his biting wit. Amongst the early editors was W.T. Cocking (designer of the WW television sets); the last five editors were Tom Ivall, Philip Darrington, Frank Ogden, Martin Eccles and Phil Reed. The current editor is Svetlana Josifovska. On pages 232 and 233 of the April 1961 Golden Jubilee issue, regular contributor \\"Free Grid\\" speculates what the next 50 years might hold and predicts that \\"long before our centenary year ... all positions now sacred to the male will have been taken over by women.\\" He went on to make certain remarks in jest about the \\"editress of 2011\\" that would not be acceptable today. Pat Hawker MBE, also well known for the \\"Technical Topics\\" feature he authored for exactly 50 years in the Radio Society of Great Britain's \\"Radio Communication\\" or \\"RadCom\\" magazine, contributed the regular column \\"World of Amateur Radio\\" from May 1969 to April 1982. An occasional contributor, Ivor Catt, sparked controversy with an article on electromagnetism in December 1978 by challenging the validity of Maxwell's displacement current. This spawned an exchange of letters to the editor which lasted for years.

Taxonomy Elderberry panax was first described by Franz Sieber in 1830 as Panax sambucifolius. It was given its current name in 1894 by German botanist Hermann Harms. The taxonomy of the small basswood has been reviewed, resulting in the recognition of three sub species: sambucifolia, decomposita and leptophylla.http://plantnet.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/cgi- bin/NSWfl.pl?page=nswfl&lvl;=sp&name;=Polyscias~sambucifolia Common names for these plants include small basswood, elderberry panax, ornamental ash and elderberry ash. Description Elderberry panax grows to 11 metres tall with a trunk diameter of 20 cm at Errinundra National Park and Otway National Park in the state of Victoria. The trunk is straight. Bark is dark brown or black. Fairly smooth, marked by lenticles, pustules and lines. Leaves Leaf form varies between different sub forms of this plant. See Plant Net for detailed descriptions between the sub species. Leaves are pinnate or bipinnate, with leaflets. Between one and six pairs of leaflets on the leaf stem. Leaflets of sub species sambucifolia are toothed, ovate in shape. The other sub species leaves are not toothed. Leaflets 2 to 20 cm long. Leaves glossy green above, dull glaucous below. A terminal leaflet is seen on the end of the compound leaf. Leaf stalks vary between 20 mm and no leaf stalk in sub species leptophylla. Leaf shape varies between ovate or elliptic to broad-elliptic in sub species sambucifolia. However the sessile leaflets of sub species leptophylla are oblong linear and somewhat curved (falcate) in shape. Leaf formation is two-pinnate or rarely three-pinnate in sub species decomposita. Leaf veins evident on both the upper and lower surfaces. Sunken on the top of the leaf, raised below. Flowers and fruit Yellow/green flowers form on panicles from December to February. The fruit is an edible globose mericarp, 4 to 6 mm long. Mauve or blue in colour. Containing one or two seeds, 2 mm long. Fruit matures from January to April. Distribution and habitat The natural range of distribution is from Cape Otway (38¬∞ S) in the state of Victoria to the McPherson Range (28¬∞ S), on the border of New South Wales and Queensland. It is often seen on the edge of rainforests. Ecology Currawongs eat the fruit. The caterpillars of the elderberry panax leaf roller (Cryptoptila australana) eat the leaves. Uses Elderberry panax has attractive foliage and fruit.

It also briefly operated an outer belt, which became the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad in 1907. The New York Central Railroad acquired control of the company in 1922 and leased it to subsidiary Chicago River and Indiana Railroad. The line is now owned and operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway. History When the Union Stock Yard and Transit Company of Chicago was incorporated in 1865 to consolidate the Chicago stock yards, its powers included the construction of a railroad outside the city limits (then Pershing Road and Western Avenue) to link the stock yards with the railroads entering Chicago south of Roosevelt Road.An act to incorporate the Union Stock Yard and Transit Company of Chicago, approved February 13, 1865 All nine of these railroads - the Chicago and Alton Railroad, Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, Chicago and Great Eastern Railway, Chicago and North Western Railway, Chicago and Rock Island Railroad, Illinois Central Railroad, Michigan Central Railroad, Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad, and Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway - had previously come to an agreement to finance the new property as a replacement for their individual yards.Federal Trade Commission, Report of the Federal Trade Commission on the Meat-Packing Industry, Part III, p. 194 In December 1865, the new Union Stock Yards and railroad opened,Interstate Commerce Commission, Finance Docket No. 1165: Chicago Junction Case, May 16, 1922 the latter beginning at the Illinois Central near 43rd Street and heading west, largely along 40th Street, to the Chicago and Great Eastern, and then turning north to parallel the latter company's line in Campbell Avenue until it reached the Chicago and North Western Railway at Ogden Avenue. Prior to 1897, the Union Stock Yard and Transit Company (USY&T;) operated its own property, except between 1887 and 1893, when a number of connecting carriers organized a transfer association to operate the railroad. Subsidiary Chicago and Indiana State Line Railway was incorporated July 13, 1880, and soon constructed connections from the south border of the stock yards to the Grand Trunk Junction Railway and Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad, and from the north border along both sides of the South Fork South Branch Chicago River to near Archer Avenue. On December 15, 1897, the USY&T; leased its railroad property to the Chicago and Indiana State Line.United States v. Union Stock Yard, December 9, 1912 In August 1897, USY&T; parent Chicago Junction Railways and Union Stock Yards Company bought control of the Chicago, Hammond and Western Railroad, which was building an outer belt line around Chicago, with trackage rights over the Terminal Railroad from Argo to the stock yards.Poor's Manual of Railroads, 1897, p. 121Poor's Manual of Railroads, 1898, pp. 1140-1141 The Chicago and Indiana State Line and Chicago, Hammond and Western merged on April 26, 1898 to form the Chicago Junction Railway, now operating two belt lines. However, on October 31, 1907, the outer belt line was sold to the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad, and the Chicago Junction was back to the original line of the USY&T; and the ca. 1880 extensions north and south of the stock yards.

An LPG spill occurred when an operator was draining water from a 1,200m¬≥ pressurised propane tank. The resultant cloud of propane vapour spread, until it was ignited by a car on an adjoining road. The pool of propane in the bund caused the storage tank to be engulfed in flames, which produced a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion (BLEVE) when the tank ruptured. This resulted in a fireball which killed and injured firemen and spectators. Flying missiles broke the legs of an adjacent sphere which later BLEVE'd. Three further spheres toppled due to the collapse of support legs which were not adequately fire protected. These vessels ruptured but did not explode. A number of petrol and crude oil tanks also caught fire. The conflagration took 48 hours to bring under control. This incident resulted in the deaths of 18 people, the injury of 81 and extensive damage to the site.  Prior to the incident  The Feyzin refinery (run by Elf, now acquired by Total), employed around 250 personnel at the time of the incident and had a processing capacity of about 2 million tons of crude oil annually (40,000 barrels per day, approximately). The main refinery units were located to the north of a local road. The main storage areas were situated to the south of this road in a 145m wide strip adjacent to a boundary fence with a motorway. This was the area in which the disaster occurred. The equipment in this area consisted of: * Four 1,200m3 spherical vessels used for propane storage * Four 2,000m3 pressure vessels used for propane storage * Two 150m3 horizontal bullet pressure vessels used for propane and butane * Ten 2,500m3 and 6500m3 floating roof tanks used for the storage of finished grade petrol and kerosene The LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) storage spheres were about 450m away from the nearest refinery unit and about 300 m (1,000 feet) from the nearest houses in the village. The shortest distance between an LPG sphere and the motorway was 42.4m (138 feet), and the spacings between individual spheres varied from 11.3m (37 feet) to 17.2m (56 feet). Each of the spheres were provided with fixed watersprays both at the top and at the mid-height, plus an additional single spray directed towards the bottom connections.  The explosion  During the 6AM to 2PM shift at the factory, workers were required to take a routine sample from each of the LPG storage tanks. A team composed of a plant operator, the shift fireman and a laboratory technician were taking a sample from sphere no.443. The operator, due to the fact that he had only a single valve spanner, opened the valves in the incorrect order. This caused the release of a small amount of caustic soda and a small amount of gas when he opened the lower valve. This prompted the operator to close the valve and then reopen it, leading to only a few drops emerging. The upper valve was then opened fully. This led to a very powerful jet of propane to rush out. This release splashed up from the drain and gave frost burns to the operator on the face and forearm. As he recoiled from the flow, the operator partly pulled off the valve handle. The fireman, losing sight of the operator, turned on the water supply to the sprays fitted to the sphere and, with the operator, attempted to reposition the valve handle and shut the valve. They failed to do so. The time was now approximately 06.40. The three workers then set off on foot to sound the alarm and seek help (they were afraid of using the telephone or starting up the truck that transported them there in case they set fire to the escaping gas). They were successful in raising the alarm, and traffic was stopped on the nearby motorway. However, the escaping gas ignited. The fire services attended the blaze, but they were not trained in controlling the type of BLEVE fire. While they attempted to cool the surrounding gas spheres, the leaking sphere exploded, killing several firemen. The explosion also caused another sphere to topple and leak gas. Lessons from Feyzin The Feyzin disaster was the worst accident which had occurred in petroleum and petrochemical plants in Western Europe, prior to the Flixborough disaster in 1974. Since then, many pressurised tanks containing liquefied gases have BLEVE'd. The hazards are now better understood and storage spheres are protected from fire engulfment by better design. However, so many firemen and emergency servicemen have been killed while trying to control large fires that the cautious philosophy is to evacuate and take shelter until the material burns itself out. BLEVE's produce intense thermal radiation from the fireball. This and blast damage from the bursting pressure vessel are relatively localised compared with unconfined vapour cloud explosions. Therefore, evacuation of up to 0.5 km will usually ensure the safety of people. Burning hydrocarbon storage vessels are very spectacular but unpredictable. Therefore, newsmen and sightseers must be kept well away for their own safety.

The observed spectra consist of neutral hydrogen Lyman alpha absorption lines which are broadened by radiation damping. These systems can be observed in quantity at relatively high redshifts of 2-4, when they contained most of the neutral hydrogen in the universe. They are believed to be associated with the early stages of galaxy formation, as the high neutral hydrogen column densities of DLAs are also typical of sightlines in the Milky Way, and other nearby galaxies. Since they are observed in absorption rather than by their stars, they offer the opportunity to study the dynamics of the gas in early galaxies directly.

With a market share of nearly 100%, it controls all major functions of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing in Sri Lanka. It is one of the only two on-grid electricity companies in the country; the other being Lanka Electricity Company (LECO). The company earned approximately LKR 204.7 billion in 2014, with a total of nearly 5.42 million consumer accounts. It is a government owned and controlled utility of Sri Lanka that takes care of the general energy facilities of the island. The Ministry of Power and Energy is the responsible ministry above the CEB. Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), established by an CEB Act No. 17 of 1969, is under legal obligation to develop and maintain an efficient, coordinated and economical system of Electricity supply in accordance with any Licenses issue Subsidiaries CEB has following subsideries * Lanka Electricity Company * LTL Holdings (Pvt) Ltd * Lanka Coal Company Ltd * Sri Lanka Energy (Pvt) Ltd * Trincomalee Power Company Limited (Joint Venture) Electricity Generation Hydro power Electricity generation by CEB is primarily done by hydro power. Hydro power is the oldest and most dependent source of electricity generation, taking a share of nearly 42% of the total available grid capacity in December 2014, and 37% of power generated in 2014. Hydropower generation facilities has been constantly under development since the introduction of the national grid, but is currently declining due to the exhaustion of the resource. In 2014, then Media Spokesperson at the CEB, Senajith Dassanayake said the generation of hydro power has dropped to 37%; as a result, 60 percent of the electricity needs have to be fulfilled by thermal energy. Thermal Power The Norocholai Coal Power Station, the only coal-fired power station in the country is owned by CEB; it was commissioned in late-2011 and finished in 2014, under loans from Export-Import Bank of China. It added further of electrical capacity to the grid. The Sampur Coal Power Station, is currently under consideration in Trincomalee. Coal Power Development In 2011, Ceylon Electricity Board opened a new coal power plant named Puttalam Lakvijaya. On 13 February 2011 it was synchronized with the system. On 17 September 2014, US$1.35 billion coal-fired Norochcholai Power Station was commissioned by the Chinese President Xi Jinping on his visit to Sri Lanka. The Export-Import Bank of China provided a US$450 million loan for the first 300 megawatt unit at the power plant. The power plant was officially commenced on 16 September 2014. Controversies Blackouts and shutdowns *On October 2010, during a test run, a fire broke out in the chimney due to clogging. Splits in the cooling system piping triggered a shutdown down of the power plant. The Ceylon Electricity Board decided to institute blackouts to households and Industries for three hours a day until the fault is fully repaired. *On December 2013, more leaks were discovered in the cooling system, the CEB decided that the plant was too dangerous to operate at the moment. The CEB requested assistance from CMEC, and the company said that it would take about six weeks to fix the faults. After negotiations, the plant was repaired by CMEC and brought back online. A day later it failed once more and was shut down again for six more days. *In 2014, then Minister of Power and Energy, Pavithra Wanniarachchi, revealed that the Norochcholai power plant had been offline for 271 days out of the 1086 days since it had been operating. *On 25 February 2016, the entire country of Sri Lanka experienced a 3-hour blackout due to a lightning striking the national power grid. *On 13 March 2016, Sri Lanka experienced another 7 hour island wide blackout due to a damaged transformer in the 220 kV substation at Biyagama. It is considered to be the worst nationwide power outage in 20 years. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe appointed a five-member committee to investigate the blackout. Due to initial suspicions of sabotage, President Maithripala Sirisena deployed troops to guard electrical installations until the investigation was completed. The CEB also reported that the outage caused Lakvijaya Coal Power Plant to fail, resulting in a loss of 900 Mega Watts to the National Grid. On March 23, 2016, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya notified parliament that the reason for the power outage was a lack of regular maintenance of power installations. The engineer in charge of the Biyagama Substation had previously reported that a key transformer needed maintenance; however, no repairs were made.  2019 electricity crisis  *In March 2019, the CEB decided to impose four-hour rolling power cut on a scheduled basis throughout Sri Lanka after the national grid capacity failed to meet the increased demand for power due to dry climate, and due to limited power generation. Losses Ceylon Electricity Board has lost 25.5 billion rupees in 2011, and run up debts of 121 billion rupees with a petroleum distributor and independent power producers. In 2012, the CEB lost 61.2 billion rupees and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation which supplied fuel below cost 89.7 billion rupees. To cover up the loss, the CEB increased power tariffs in large scales. The CEB expected to get revenues of 223 billion rupees‚Äîor 45 billion rupees more than the earlier tariff‚Äîfrom the price hike, but subsequently lost 33 billion rupees in 2013 on total expenses of 256 billion rupees. On 16 September 2014, after officially opening a completed $1.35 billion Chinese- financed 900 MW coal power plant project, Sri Lankan President at the time, Mahinda Rajapaksa addressed the nation saying that the electricity bills of the people will be reduced by 25%. The CEB stated that it will take about two weeks to come up with a process of creating electricity bills to reflect the reduction in prices. Employee Tax The CEB has been accused of Tax fraud by the Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE), which has claimed that CEB has not deducted PAYE from its engineers and senior staff since 2010 amounting to Rs. 3465 million.

The company was created to help address the global obesity crisis, which faces the UK, and the wider general population. Almost 1 in 4 adults in England are currently obese, and if this pattern were to continue in this current manner 9 in 10 adults would be overweight or obese by 2050. One of the key reasons for this is that more than 85% of the adult population, either can't, won't or don't visit a gym or health club in order to participate in regular exercise. The typical barrier reasons to participation are personal reasons such as privacy, self- consciousness, intimidation, cost, flexibility and geography. The \\"delivery solution\\" from VirtualGym TV was designed to permit on-demand access to exercise to eliminate these participation barriers. The company reached out to an audience of in excess of 130,000 retail and corporate users. History The idea was founded when the then Managing Director, Richard Davis, was having a conversation with a high level instructor colleague, where at the time, the only real options were to either create a Fitness DVD and distribute it in the normal way, or to broadcast on the television. Coming from a background in Employee Benefits, Davis developed what is primarily a corporate benefit for large scale, fragmented workforces, but was accessible by the wider genera public as well. The company continued to grow and by the summer of 2008 it formed a strategic alliance with the major sportswear manufacturer, Asics. More recently, they had achieved approval from the Department of Health and are a delivery partner of the Change4Life and MoreActive4Life social obesity campaigns (NHS) before they closed down. They also worked in partnership with their alcohol limits campaign, and the business awareness campaign with the FIA (Fitness Industry Association). Features The core of the product was powered by the 'Virtual Personal Trainer' (VPT) software which was a bespoke facility. The software captured a broad range of physiological and psychological data, which was analysed by the VPT software and appropriate exercise recommendations were prescribed specifically tailored for the individual. The VPT would specifically recommend which sessions the customer should participate in, the frequency with which they should participate and the intensity level that was right for them. The user would then participate in regular exercise from their ever-changing library of exercise content across all exercise areas. This ranged from Aerobics through to Pilates, Stability Ball and very specific pre & post natal content. It was rumoured that the launch of 'Virtual Personal Trainer 2' (VPT2) software, early in 2010, would see the introduction of new features to increase the accuracy of customers own fitness program, the capturing of live physiological data during exercise, as well as a number of downloadable software applications for mobile handset devices. Classes Each week approximately 40 new classes were uploaded to the site. The bank of classes and tuition classes were delivered through the internet to both retail and corporate clients, via their website. Typical classes included aerobics, step aerobics, boxercise, kick boxing, yoga, pilates, t'ai chi, body conditioning, circuit training, body sculpting, medicine ball, dance, stationary (spin) bicycle, treadmill, interval training, and various martial arts training sessions, (including meditation / relaxation). Classes were scheduled in a similar fashion to a traditional gym, with shorter energising sessions in the morning and longer sessions in the afternoon and evening, which last between 45 and 60. Sessions were broadcast across a range of ability standards, so that customers could choose the appropriate complexity and fitness demand that was relevant for them. Customers could also learn a new fitness skill from scratch, with ‚Äústarter‚Äù teaching sessions for those who had never participated in that exercise type before. Instructors Instructors were accredited with the Register of Exercise Professions (REPS), the governing body for the health and fitness industry, and the National Register of Personal Trainers. They were qualified to a minimum level by the relevant professional organisation. Instructors include Pierre Pozzuto, personal trainer of Gordon Ramsay, Christian Slater and Keira Knightley. Other well known instructors included Dan Little, Jackie Diss and Chris Roberts.

It was established in 1869 by Swedish expatriate Carl Axel Geijer in Kristiania. His purpose was to be a wholesaler of iron and other metal products, but the company soon started producing wire and fence-related products. It was among the country's leading companies in its field. After Carl Axel Geijer's death in 1899, the company was eventually taken over by C. J. Aasgaard. Leadership was passed on to his son Torleif Aasgaard in 1927, then to Tor and Iver Aasgaard in 1952. Between 1923 and 1930, a subdivision of the company produced the car brand Geijer. The engine was imported from Hershell-Spillmann, from 1926 Lycoming Engines, and the gearbox was from Mechanics Machine Co, but several other parts including the coachwork were produced on-site in Kristiania. In total about 25 cars were produced, none of which exist today. The company also produced about 300 bus coachworks. From 1983 C. Geijer & Co had to cooperate with Trondhjems Jernindustri in fence products. Its financial situation became worse towards the end of the 1980s.

The name stems from a combination of the Korean words baduk (‚ÄúGo‚Äù) and juntoo (‚Äúbattle‚Äù). It is played entirely in cyberspace, and differs from Go in a number of ways, most noticeably in the way in which certain areas of the board are worth different point values. The other principal difference is that both players place three stones before the game begins, and may also place a special ‚Äúhidden stone‚Äù, which affects the board as a regular stone but is invisible to the opponent. It was launched in November 2008.  Gameplay  Batoo is usually played on an 11x11 board, although some games may take place on boards as large as 13x13. Boards in Batoo usually have plus-point and minus-point spots. When a player plays on these spots, they will either gain or lose five points. Different \\"maps\\" will have different plus-point locations and minus-point locations. Before the game begins, both players place a \\"base build\\", consisting of three marked stones. When players are making their base-builds, they cannot see their opponent's base build. If there is any overlap, a minus-point will replace the pair of stones. Base stones are worth 5 points each, as opposed to a normal stone which is worth only 1. The player who starts is the one who makes the highest bid of points to their opponent for the privilege. This process is also known as \\"turn-betting\\". Once the base-building and the turn- betting end, both players have 25-second intervals to make each move. For every stone on the board, a player will gain 1 point. If a player takes more than 25 seconds to make their move, they lose 2 points (unless a 'special ability' character is used) and a new 25-second interval begins. If more than 3 25-second intervals are taken by any player during the game, that player loses the game. The territory each player has at the end of the game is then added to the score.  Hidden stone  The most unusual aspect about Batoo is the Hidden Stone. Once per game, every player may play a Hidden Stone instead of a normal stone. The Hidden Stone is not revealed to the opponent until they play a move where the Hidden Stone is located or until they locate it with a scan. A player may play a \\"scan\\" for 2 points, where they click a spot on the board and discover whether or not the Hidden Stone is on it. The player may make a normal or hidden stone move following the scan.  Characters, special abilities, and customization  A player can select one of three characters that grant the player special abilities. A fourth character can be bought using the in-game currency. The players can also buy different color substitutes for black stones [dark red, dark green, dark violet, dark blue] and can also buy different-looking boards with different themes with the in- game currency.  Ranking  Player ability in Batoo is determined by \\"levels\\". Learners start at level 5, and can progress up to level 35.

History The Peace Mothers dates from 1999. A member of the founding Assembly explained \\" We had come together to say that the dirty war should come to an end and that there should be peace among Turks and Kurds.\\" Many of the women involved have lost a close relative in the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict. In the words of T√ºrkiye Bozkurt \\" In 1999 we came together as mothers, whose children were either in the mountains, in prisons or had lost their lives in the war.\\" They are based in Istanbul and Diyarbakir. They have been frequently in the news for their protests and court cases. In 2000, Amnesty International reported a delegation of Peace Mothers had allegedly been tortured and ill-treated, after they travelled to neighbouring Iraq to try to mediate between the two sides in the civil conflict in the Kurdish region in North Iraq. The lawyer who defended them, Eren Keskin, was later put on trial for having insulted the army after her description of the alleged torture of the Peace Mothers was published in a newspaper. In June 2006, Peace Mother activists Muyesser Gunes and Sakine Arat were sentenced to 1-year jail each and 600 YTL in Ankara 4th Criminal Court on a charge of praising a separatist organisation and its leader, after they had visited the General Staff headquarters on 22 August 2005 to present their case. The sentence was later commuted to 10 months. In July 2006, twenty-four Peace Mothers aged between 40 and 75 years, were sentenced to 12 months‚Äô jail by the Diyarbakƒ±r 4th Criminal Court after being found guilty of voicing \\"separatist propaganda\\".

The game was ported by fans to Amiga in July 2014, and on Amiga CD32 in December 2014 and was converted from the Atari ST version with some enhancements which were not present in other iterations. The game was produced by Denton Designs as a follow-up to their successful 1986 title The Great Escape.  Plot  A plane has crashed in a remote and unknown plateau of the Himalayas. To their horror, the survivors soon discover that it is populated by dangerous prehistoric creatures and tribes. The player must guide the party of four survivors - the pilot, Jarret, and his three passengers - to safety, avoiding dinosaurs, cannibals and natural dangers, while also ensuring they are sufficiently rested and fed during the long and difficult journey.  Description  The graphics are rendered in isometric 3D projection. The Atari ST and Spectrum versions are monochrome while the DOS version uses four-color CGA. The DOS version has no music, with sounds limited to PC speaker beeps and clicks. The Amiga and Amiga CD32 versions for the most part are a 1:1 rendition of the Atari ST version, but does have some notable enhancements such as full introduction sequence, based on the comic book style adverts that were available and enhanced music that utilise the Amiga better. The Amiga CD32 version is the same as the Amiga version except it uses AmigaDOS for preloading all files and then running the entire game from RAM.  Gameplay  The player initially controls Jarret, the leader of the party. The other survivors are Clive, a wealthy businessman; Gloria, his daughter; and Dirk, her fianc√©. Each member of the party may be controlled by the player or by the game. Each member of the party has a different personality and abilities. For example, Clive is overweight, tires easily, and is always hungry. Dirk is athletic and has some knowledge of the local languages; he is reluctant to leave Gloria, and will become despondent if she dies. Useful objects are scattered about the map, which should be carefully explored. A simple menu and cursor system is used to select members and manipulate objects. Computer- controlled characters will complain if they are injured, tired or hungry. It is up to the player to decide what action to take in response. Indulge them too often, and food and time will run short. Ignore them, and they will abandon you and try to make their own way to safety.

P.I.S. pretends to be a TV-documentary about Politiets IndsatsStyrke - a caricature of the real-world Politiets Aktionsstyrke, the Danish equivalent of a SWAT team. The film crew accompanies the unit, especially officer John Schmidt (Jonas Schmidt), both at work and in private. Initially the unit is pictured very convincingly as an actual police unit but as the show progress, the unit‚Äôs missions, attitudes and actions become more and more absurd, until it is obvious to viewers that it is a satirical mockumentary. When the first episodes were shown, many viewers thought it was an actual documentary. The abbreviation P.I.S. means piss in Danish, which should be a dead give-away about the nature of the show. The style of the show, however, convinced many people that it was a documentary, and that the abbreviation was just an unfortunate, but real, occurrence. Other Danish police and army institutions sound peculiar in Danish, when abbreviated, such as the Danish Defence Intelligence Service (da: Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste - FE) sounding like the Danish word for fairy, or the police equivalent (PET), hence P.I.S. wasn't too far off. The characters of the show shows an assortment of politically incorrect reactions towards the world and especially their (new) colleagues, such as racism and sexism, schadenfreude when a newly arrived female colleague accidentally shoots herself in the face and dies from her wounds, overzealousness resulting in unnecessary deaths, shooting Muslims suspects almost on sight, careless handling of loaded weapons, driving under the influence, and an almost complete lack of remorse when something has gone awry.  Cast   Regular cast  * John played by Jonas Schmidt. ::John is formally tactical leader of the team, although he is soon usurped by NC, and quickly becomes bottom of the heap. He holds a perpetual grudge against NC. Is the \\"main character\\" of the show. Is a bit of a bureaucrat after being demoted from tactical leader, especially regarding the tactical \\"Order to Go\\", always issued by Bjarne, and finds improvisation impossible, until he gets that order. Ends most episodes by buying a beer for the team at \\"Rosie McGee's\\", a Bar/restaurant in Copenhagen, Denmark. * Bjarne played by Carsten Kressner. ::The operational leader of the team. Is very media-conscious and does everything to make the team look good. Upon the arrival of NC, he actively uses NC's good looks and media talent as the team's \\"image\\", much to the other team members‚Äô regret. Almost never finds flaws with his team - at least he won't admit it to the camera, although he is forced, from time to time to put his foot down, though always too late to really make a difference. * NC played by Lai Yde Holgaard. ::Newest man on the team, NC is a handsome-looking person with an enlarged sense of his own qualities. Is a fashion vegetarian, media-darling and at times find it difficult to tend his job, because he's participating in TV- shows, recording a pop-album, modelling etc. * Sebastian played by Rasmus Bjerg. ::The team sniper, Sebastian, usually referred to by his last name, Dvorsky, is the only married man in the tactical group. He shows extensive disregard for his surroundings and is quick to pick on his colleagues, especially the newcomers. Despite this, he is rarely chastised for it. Has numerous dubious killings on his record but never lets it interfere with his professionalism. He takes his own job very seriously and is of the misconception, that he should shoot to kill, more often than not. Dvorsky is in many ways the opposite of NC. Where NC characterizes himself as a vegetarian, Dvorsky refers to himself as a \\"meatarian\\" complaining that he gets rashes if he doesn't eat enough pork, and proudly states, that the only spice he eats, is the animal kingdoms own spice: Bacon! He finds work hard to do, if he doesn't eat, and refuses to leave the unit truck, before he has had his lunch (consisting mainly of meat). * Svetlana played by Oksana Ivanova. ::Svetlana is John's au pair, with whom he falls in love. She is later seduced by NC (who finds her irresistible, mainly due to her association with John), ticking off John, resulting in a violent episode. * speak by Torben Sekov. ::The speak was made by Torben Sekov, a much-used voice-over in Danish documentaries. This added greatly to the illusion that the show was factual. His comments sometimes downplays even the most extreme events, fooling the viewer into thinking that what just transpired, was in fact in accordance with standard procedure or something to that effect.  One Episode  * Hassan played by Isam Subeihi. ::A new member of the squad, and a P.R. scoop by Bjarne, because getting an immigrant into the force shows the unit from a positive side. Most of the team is ambiguous about or downright opposes the inclusion of Hassan. Despite proving competent, Sebastian shoots and kills him on a mission \\"mistaking\\" him for the hostage taker. * Nina played by Katja Holm. ::Finds a romantic interest in John, who refuses her, being already involved with Svetlana. Both NC and Sebastian try to sabotage her trial period. She easily beats Sebastian in a gun-assembling contest (Sebastian being the uncontested leader in that discipline in the team), and is later knocked over by play-fighting NC and Sebastian, resulting in the gun discharging in her face. Neither NC nor Sebastian mourns her death, the latter commenting with a smirk \\"I think she assembled that gun a bit too fast\\". * Finn Ahrenkiel played by Steen Herdel. * Susanne played by Dya Hauch. * Rudi played by Hans Peter Hendrich. ::Rudi is the German voice actor of John. In Germany the tactical leader, John, is especially famous in the North-eastern part of Germany. However as John gets fired in episode 6, season 2, he travels to Denmark to seek down John. \\".

The company offers interconnect components, including radio frequency/coaxial connectors and cable assemblies, antennas, fiber optic connectors and cable assemblies, microwave components and cable assemblies, microwave switches, and multipin connectors. It serves the aerospace, defense, industrial, instrumentation, telecom, space and medical markets. The company markets its products worldwide through a network of agents and distributors. Co-founded by Yvon and Lucien Gattaz in 1952, it is headquartered in Paris, France. In 2018, Radiall's revenue was 357 million euros.  History   1952-1962  In the spring of 1952, two brothers, Yvon and Lucien Gattaz, founded Radiall. Yvon Gattaz was the entrepreneur who took care of the commercial and financial aspect of the business. Lucien was the inventor. He was more interested in the technical aspects of research and production. In 1953, they bought their first workshop in Paris, France. They had already chosen a slogan: \\"Speed & Quality.\\" At that time, France intended to be a world leader in television by using higher frequencies through its SECAM standard. The antenna had to be linked to the TV monitor with a coaxial cable. Yvon and Lucien worked hard to invent a cheap and easy-to-use interconnect that would fit the application. By 1954, Radiall was producing 100,000 connectors per month. The coaxial connector Mini-Quick  1962-1972  In November 1963, Yvon and Lucien inaugurated their first factory at Voiron in Isere, France. The factory was 2,500 m2 (27,000 sq ft). That same year, the company launched the coaxial connector Mini-Quick. Five years later, in 1968, Radiall built its headquarters at Rosny-Sous-Bois. This 4,000 m2 (43,000 sq ft) two-story building (the third floor came after) is made only of glass and foil. By 1967, the Gattazes were already thinking about expanding in Europe, so they created a subsidiary in Staines, England: Radiall Microwave Components Ltd. In 1969, they opened another office in Buchslag, Germany: RGmbH. The goal of these new offices was to develop a European sales network.  1972-1982  In 1972, Lucien Gattaz had identified the company Sogie as a competitor in the connector business. It was for sale and showing a deficit, so Radiall made its first acquisition It only took a few years to make it profitable. Buying Sogie showed Radiall's desire to continue specializing in multipin connectors. That same year, the company also started getting interested in Aerospace and Fiber Optics. A new facility was built in 1977 in Voreppe, France. A year later, a new factory was created in L‚ÄôIsle d'Abeau to produce hyper frequency components for military use. France's Prime Minister visited this site on June 6, 1980.  1982-1992  In 1982, Radiall got its first Computer-Assisted-Design equipment. During the 80s, Radiall expanded worldwide with offices in the United States (Stratford, Connecticut), Brazil (Rio de Janeiro) and Asia (Hong Kong) In 1984, Boeing qualified Radiall connectors that comply with the ARINC 600 standard. This was also a period of inventions, as Radiall obtained 15 patents from 1984 to 1986. Radiall also entered the French stock market in 1989, selling 20% of its capital to the public.  1992-2007  A multipin connector: the EPX In 1992, Pierre Gattaz, son of Radiall‚Äôs co-founder Yvon Gattaz, became the new CEO of the company. In order to become a major US player in the multipin connector business (concerning mostly the Aerospace industry), Radiall acquired Jerrik in May 1995, located in Tempe, Arizona. Radiall continued its expansion in the United States with the acquisition of Larsen, a company based in Portland, Oregon that specialized in antennas for military purposes. In 1994, the company continued to expand in Asia with Radiall Protectron, located in Bangalore, India. Later on, Radiall created a presence in Japan when it opened Radiall Nihon. In 2005, Radiall acquired Applied Engineering Products (AEP) located in New Haven, CT. The AEP product line was integrated into Radiall‚Äôs portfolio. Finally, in July 1997, Radiall Shanghai was inaugurated, becoming Radiall‚Äôs first entity in China. Radiall's goal was to reach sales of one billion francs by the year 2000, a goal that was actually reached three years early, in 1997. 2001 was a tough year for the company, due to the telecommunication crisis and the September 11 aftermath. This forced the company to reduce its manpower by 30% in two years due to a 40% activity loss.  2008-present  On January 8, 2008, Radiall announced an increase in its shareholdings of the start-up D-Lightsys D-Lightsys web site to 95 percent. On June 1, 2008, Radiall AEP Inc Applied Engineering Products (AEP) web site and Radiall USA Inc were consolidated into one company Radiall USA, Inc. The combined company does business as Radiall and covering the North American territory where Radiall currently has 3 sites: Tempe, AZ; New Haven, CT, and Obregon, Sonora, Mexico.

In June 2019, Radiall and CEA-Leti announced a partnership to design RF components for 5G networks and photonics components for harsh environments. In August 2019, Radiall announced the acquisition of Solyneo. In August 2019, Radiall USA, Inc. announced it was moving its New Haven, CT site to Wallingford, CT. In January 2020, Radiall announced it was acquiring Timbercon, a fiber optic interconnect products company.  Governance  Radiall is governed by two boards, a Supervisory Board and an Executive Board.

They are an independent band and signed with Blakmorse record. History Zeke and The Popo, begins as a side project from Zeke (vocal, piano & guitar from the band LAIN) at 2003. Zeke then asked Leonardo Ringo (a.k.a. Mugeni) to jam and the two quickly felt a chemistry between them to create music together. Not long after, they asked Iman Fattah (a.k.a. Babyfaced) also from the band LAIN to play synthesizer. As the trio jammed and played gigs often, they contributed for J.K.T.S.K.R.G compilation from aksara records and this marked the need for a drummer & bass player because the band had felt that their music has grown from a 3 piece sound based band to a spacey, ambient layered analog band. Thus, they asked Amir (a.k.a. Kuro) to play drum & Yuditia Noor (a.k.a. Sideburns) to play bass. In November 2003, they performed together for the first time on the first event in Aksara Bookstore Kemang.http://www.thejakartapost.com/.../zeke-and-popo-a-think-tank- today039s-generation.html - All of their albums, plus extra tracks, are now available to buy as a digital download at www.buttonijo.com Soundtrack In 2005, ZATPP (as the band is also known) contributed 3 of their music to the soundtrack of the film \\"Joni's Promise\\" (including a song called \\"Mighty Love\\" which was credit to their alter-ego band Salvatore Mamadou) and the film became a major success and so is ZATPP gained a large number of fans during that year. In March 2005, ZATPP released their first EP, \\"Unrescued World\\" which contains four songs. It didn't take too long for the CD to sold out. The effect of ZATPP EP's selling created a buzz and generates a large number of followers in Bandung (in a monthly event \\"Les Voila 2005\\", which also featured some prominents local acts like Mocca and The S.I.G.I.T, ZATPP attracted more followers). In November 2006 ZATPP once again contributed a song in the original soundtrack of \\"6:30\\". In the launching of the movie, ZATPP performs with their respectable contemporaries, NAIF and Pure Saturday. Aside from the music project, Zeke was also a composer of a film score and a music director of \\"KALA\\" directed by Joko Anwar ( \\"Joni's Promise\\" director). Zeke also directed the Space in the Headlines' single music video, making the best out of his film education in London. Currently (in 2007) Zeke successfully launch a \\"KALA\\" original soundtrack together with Zeke and the Popo debut album, \\"Space in the Headlines\\" under Black Morse Records. The first single released from \\"KALA\\" original soundtrack was \\"Hope Killer\\" which is also recognized as the teaser for \\"Space in the Headlines\\". In Space in the Headlines, ZATPP offers richer and more organic sounds compared to their previous EP. However, for the listener it would not be hard to recognize the trade mark spacey soundscape that's ZATPPesque.

It resulted in a comprehensive victory for the Latins. There are two accounts of the battle, one by Geoffrey de Villehardouin, and the other by Nicetas Choniates, which differ significantly.  Villehardouin's account  Henry of Flanders, brother to Emperor Baldwin I of Constantinople, was encouraged by the Armenians to make an attempt on the city of Adramyttion. He left from Abydos, after leaving a garrison in the town, and rode for two days before encamping before Adramyttion. The city soon surrendered, and Henry proceeded to occupy the city, using it as a base to attack the Byzantines. Theodore Laskaris, who had been troubled by his defeat at Poemanenum, collected as many people as he could from around Nicaea and assembled a large army. He gave the command of this force to his brother, Constantine, who was dispatched immediately to Adramyttion. Henry of Flanders had received word from the Armenians that a large Byzantine force was marching against him, so he prepared his limited forces as best he could. On March 19, 1205, Constantine appeared before the walls of the city. Henry, refusing to remain trapped behind the walls of Adramyttion, opened the gates and rode out with his heavy cavalry. The two sides engaged in close hand-to-hand combat, with victory falling to the Franks, who killed or captured much of the Byzantine army. The Franks went on to capture a large amount of weaponry and treasure in the aftermath.  Choniates' account  According to Niketas Choniates, the commander of the Byzantine forces was not Constantine Laskaris, but Theodore Mangaphas, a usurper who held the city of Philadelphia. Heartened by news of a victory against the Latins, Theodore marched against Henry who was at Adramyttion. At first he took Henry by surprise, causing him great consternation because of his large forces. Henry, convinced that he had to make a desperate attempt, drew up his cavalry in battle array, and raising their lances, they awaited the Byzantine attack. But the Byzantines were reluctant to undertake the initiative for battle, and were listless and sluggish in repulsing the cavalry charges. At a given signal, Henry leaped ahead of the others and rode his horse through the centre of their ranks, while his cavalry, couching their lances and raising the war cry, scattered the Byzantines and pressed upon them as they retreated. Large numbers of Byzantines were cut down, with their cavalry fleeing, abandoning the infantry to slaughter and captivity.  Reconciliation of the accounts  Subsequent historians have attempted to address the apparent discrepancies between the two sources.

Davies has written extensively as a freelancer, as well as for The Guardian and The Observer, and been named Reporter of the Year, Journalist of the Year and Feature Writer of the Year at the British Press Awards. Davies has made documentaries for ITV's World in Action and written numerous books on the subject of politics and journalism, including Flat Earth News, which attracted considerable controversy as an expos√© of journalistic malpractice in the UK and around the globe. As a reporter for The Guardian, Davies was responsible for uncovering the News of the World phone hacking scandal, including the July 2011 revelations of hacking into the mobile phone voicemail of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Career in journalism Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina. Following the publication of Flat Earth News and a Guardian story co-written by Davies claiming that News of the World journalists tapped private mobile phones to get stories, on 14 July 2009 Davies told the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee that the Metropolitan Police Service had done too little to investigate the claims. The Guardian coverage also led to calls from high-profile MPs for the dismissal of Andy Coulson, communications director for the Conservative Party. Davies received the Paul Foot Award 2011 for his work on this story.Dan Sabbagh \\"Nick Davies wins award for hacking expos√©\\", The Guardian, 29 February 2012, p.5 Davies's book on the News International phone hacking scandal, Hack Attack: How the Truth Caught Up with Rupert Murdoch, was released in August 2014. Critical reaction to Flat Earth News Flat Earth News was greeted in the London Review of Books on its publication as \\"a genuinely important book, one which is likely to change, permanently, the way anyone who reads it looks at the British newspaper industry\\". The LRB highlighted the analysis showing that 60% of the content of UK papers was based mainly on wire copy or press releases, a practice Davies called \\"churnalism\\", while only 12% are original stories and only 12% of stories showed evidence that the central statement had been corroborated. Mary Riddell in The Observer disputed some of the charges against British journalism in the book, and described it as \\"unduly pessimistic\\". Peter Oborne in The Spectator concentrated on the use of illegal techniques to invade privacy rather than declining standards, describing Flat Earth News as \\"hypnotically readable\\" and praising the collection of evidence that the practice of journalism is \\"bent\\", although qualifying this somewhat by suggesting that Davies \\"ignores a great deal [of journalism] that is salient and good\\".

He set several Guinness World Records related to high-altitude river rafting. Biography Lysenko was born in Kharkov, USSR on 1 January 1955 in the family of pilot Ivan Lysenko and engineer-designer Galina Lysenko (Korotkova). He had graduated from the Kharkov Aviation University (aircraft construction faculty) with honors and the postgraduate course of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (in the specialty \\"mechanics of fluid, gas and plasma\\"). Vladimir has three children: Victor (birthday 27.10.80), after graduating from Novosibirsk State University (Faculty of Economics) who moved from Novosibirsk to Krasnodar; Svetlana (28.10.83), after graduating from the Novosibirsk State University (Faculty of Economics) moved to Moscow, now lives in the Netherlands in Zuid-Scharwoude; and Slaviya (8.10.16). Education Lysenko holds a Doctorate of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in fluid mechanics. He is a leading fellow at the Institute of Mechanics of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Novosibirsk. He authored the book Stability and Transition of High-Speed Boundary Layers and Wakes, as well as over 200 scientific papers. Traveling Rafting Vladimir on Kemabu River, New Guinea Between 1991 and 1992, Lysenko became the first man to raft on rivers flowing down all of the world's eight-thousanders‚Äîthe 14 mountains with peaks higher than above sea level. In 1996, Lysenko became the first man to raft down the highest peak of every continent (except the Antarctic), as well as the highest peak of Oceania. While rafting down Mount Everest in Nepal in April and May 1991, Lysenko set the Guinness World Record for the greatest altitude difference travelled in a rafting trip: a descent of from Dughla on the Khumbu Glacier ( above sea level) to Chatara ( above sea level). In September 1996, he set the Guinness World Record for high-altitude rafting with a start on the Eastern Rong Chu River on Mount Everest; the previous record of had been set in September 1976 by the Mike-Jones team of England. Vladimir rafted also on mountain sources of Amazon River and the Nile, kayaked on Yukon River. He rafted in 100 countries (including Nepal, China, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, etc.). Vladimir Lysenko in Ulan Bator; Mongolia Circumnavigation in a car Between September 1997 and 2002, Lysenko crossed 62 countries by car. He crossed each continent (other than Antarctica) twice, traveling between the most distant points of each continent in both latitude and longitude. He crossed the Americas from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska to Tierra del Fuego in Argentina; from Punta Pari√±as, Peru to Cape Cabo Branko, Brazil; and from Anchor Bay, Alaska to St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. His routes across Africa took him from Cape Agulhas, South Africa to Ras-Angela Cape, Tunisia; and from Somali to Dakar. Crossing Europe and Asia, he travelled from Cabo da Roca, Portugal to Galimiy and Magadan in Russia; and from Tanjung Piai in Peninsular Malaysia to North Cape, Norway. Australia was crossed from Cape Byron to Steep Point and from Cape York Peninsula to South Point. These travels totaled .

The path of Gold Rush In 2003, Lysenko duplicated the path of the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897‚Äì1898, travelling by foot and kayak. V.Lysenko in a yacht in Indian Ocean Circumnavigation along the equator Lysenko had circumnavigated the globe from west to east, straying no more than two degrees of latitude from the Equator. Starting in Libreville (Gabon), Vladimir had successfully crossed (in a car, a motor boat, a yacht, a ship, a kayak, a bicycle, and by foot) Africa (from Libreville (Gabon) to Kiunga (Kenya) through Gabon, Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and Kenya), Indian Ocean, Indonesia (from Padang to Biak), Pacific Ocean, South America (from Pedernales (Ecuador) to Macapa (Brazil) through Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil) and Atlantic Ocean with finish in Libreville in 2012. Lysenko at the depth of 3.5 km Project \\"From Earth's Bowels to Stratosphere\\" In his project titled \\"From Earth's bowels to stratosphere\\", Lysenko descended (in 2004) to the bottom of the world's deepest mine, the Mponeng Gold Mine in Carletonville, South Africa, a depth of below ground. Then he had traveled in a car from Carletonville to Moscow, passing through South Africa, Namibia, Angola, the Congo, Zaire, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Russia. And then Lysenko made a series of lifting by various planes to the stratosphere (to the height of 11-16,5 km).

It followed on from the Relief of Kimberley as the British Army moved to take the Boer capital of Bloemfontein. The Boers were demoralised following the surrender of Piet Cronj√© at the Battle of Paardeberg. General Sir John French's cavalry attacked the Boer force from the rear while mounted infantry and horse artillery attacked from the right flank. The Boers abandoned their positions in panic before the cavalry. The commander-in-chief of the Free State forces, Christiaan de Wet, in his book called the chapter on the subject \\"Wild Flight from Poplar Grove\\". The defence The Relief of Kimberley took place on 15 February 1900. After the Battle of Paardeberg on the Modder River, the Boer commander, General Cronje, surrendered on 27 February. Christiaan de Wet was appointed as commander-in- chief of the Orange Free State. He gathered his commandos at Poplar Grove, about ten miles upstream of Paardeberg and on the way to Bloemfontein, the capital of the Orange Free State.De Wet, Christiaan Rudolf, Three Year War, Archibald Constable & Co, Ltd, 1902. De Wet hastily assembled his burghers in sangars which straddled the Modder River along a line of hillocks, about ten miles wide.Pakenham, Thomas, The Boer War, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1979. On 7 March President Kruger of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek arrived at Poplar Grove to visit his remaining burghers. No sooner had he arrived than it was reported that Lord Roberts had commenced his advance on Bloemfontein. Kruger was bundled back into his cart and sent on his way. The attack French's plan was to make a wide sweep around the six thousand Boers' left flank, without making contact, and then attack them from the rear. The infantry and the artillery would then attack them from the right. French, the cavalry division, some mounted infantry units and the horse artillery with 42 guns, carried out their order. But the Boers \\"did not behave like well-bred pheasants\\". Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote of it: \\"The plan of action was based, however, upon one supposition which proved to be fallacious. It was that after having prepared so elaborate a position the enemy would stop at least a little time to defend it.\\"Doyle, AC The Great Boer War, p.78 The flight A panic had seized the Boers. When they saw the cavalry at a distance, they all fled. De Wet and his officers tried in vain to stop them. They eventually stopped at Abraham's Kraal, some 18 miles from Poplar Grove. There they resisted the advance quite bravely the next day, but that night they fled to Bloemfontein. Again the commandos were placed in defensive positions, ready to prevent Roberts from taking the capital. That night De Wet visited all the commandos. \\"An excellent spirit prevailed among them\\", De Wet was to write later. When he reached the southern positions, it was a different matter. One of the commandos had simply abandoned their position. When the fighting started the next day, the Boers once again abandoned their positions and fled northwards.

GREEN cell stands for Global Renewable Electrical Energy Network cell. The concept resulted from a thought experiment process involving engineers working for the ABB Group that took place on March 13, 2009 in Oslo, Norway. The concept was subsequently introduced in an ABB magazine, and remains under development, as part of an open innovation process. Background The propulsion of merchant ships is responsible for approximately 4% of global carbon-dioxide emissions. The industry itself estimated its carbon footprint at 3.3% in 2007. The industry responded officially as early as 2003 by calling for measures to limit or reduce the emissions from international shipping.I In order to envision solutions to this challenge, a team of engineers and consultants associated with ABB set up a thought experiment that would pose the question: \\"How could you power the commercial fleet without fossil fuels?\\" The core team consisted of three electrical engineers: Jaakko Aho, Jukka Varis and Klaus V√§nska, all of Finland. This group laid down a core set of design principles around fossil- free marine propulsion, and described a hypothetical system that was later called the GREEN Cell shipping concept. The GREEN Cell The GREEN Cell is at the core of the shipping concept. Each GREEN cell is envisaged as a container-sized source of electricity, based on inherent chemical energy (battery), in addition to solar energy and wind energy. Each cell provides electricity to the ship's network. The electrical power potential of each GREEN cell depends on the sum of the power in the battery, the size of solar panel area obtained, the efficiency of the solar panel and the efficiency of the wind power system. Solar power Initial designs for a GREEN cell proposed that each GREEN Cell opens two doors length-wise, thus covering neighboring containers as well. The inside of the doors, and much of the exposed surface of the container are mounted with solar panels. Thus, a typical container ship could cover its entire surface with solar energy panels. One GREEN Cell produces as much as of solar panel surface area. This equates to roughly 12 kW. 100 such containers could thus conceivably produce 1.2 MW. Alternate calculations show that such a system would retrieve 500 Watts per m2. Multiplied by the approximately 20,000 m2 of surface area on a large container ship like Emma Maersk would give 10 MW of solar energy. Wind power An extendable vertical-axis windmill emerges from one side of the container. A vertical-axis windmill is preferred as it introduces less resistance to the forward motion of the ship and disturbs ship stability less than horizontal-axis windmills. Stored chemical power The battery of the GREEN cell takes up the remainder of the space in the container. Designers describe the potential battery as either an optimised lithium-ion battery, or a sodium-sulfur one. The GREEN Cell network GREEN Cell ships Like a ship that takes refrigerated containers, a GREEN Cell-equipped ship would have an electrical connection to a number of containers. In this case, instead of feeding electricity to the refrigerated units, the ship would pull power from the containers. The GREEN Cell ship carries as many as several hundred GREEN Cells, adding weight to the ship and subtracting from available cargo space. Conversely, the GREEN Cell ship forgoes a typical diesel engine (weighing roughly 75 tons), a frequency converter (weighing roughly 25 tons) and petroleum fuel tanks (as much as 3000 tons). GREEN Cell hubs A network of floating power stations placed along major trade routes either recharge a ship‚Äôs GREEN Cells, or simply switch them out (like a traditional container port). These create electricity from green sources like wave power generators, wind turbines, a flywheel-driving water density column, solar panels and current-driven turbines. Shoreside GREEN Cell centres Container terminals carry a large supply of ready-to-go GREEN Cells. These switch out GREEN Cells on ships just like a container port unloads and reloads a container ship. Thus the GREEN Cell system serves both deepsea merchant marine traffic and coastal cabotage.

Dickinson acknowledged the band's classic rock element when he said, \\"Sounds like something that Justin Hawkins would nod his head to and thoroughly approve of.\\" Miles Bartaby of the Classic Rock Society reviewed the album in the August/September 2009 edition of the Rock Society Magazine describing it as, \\"The finest debut I've heard in a while.\\"Rock Society Magazine, August/September 2009 p.39. Bartaby, Miles 2010‚Äì13: Drama EP and Curious Me In October 2010, the band spent a week in London recording three tracks at The Animal Farm. Much of the week was filmed, resulting in the documentary, \\"Drama in London\\". The band's first single of 2011, \\"ISO\\", was released on 14 March. The release was foreshadowed by a 2-month tour of the North West, billed the \\"Pay For ISO Mini-Tour\\". The tour commenced on 22 January 2011 at the Bakers Vaults in Stockport. In his review of \\"ISO\\", Colin Jackson of Loud Horizon wrote, \\"It's one of those anthemic songs that will get right inside your head and have you metaphorically punching the air all day long.\\" Jon Ashley of Manchester Music wrote, \\"ISO combines riffing, almost classic harmonious rock with the head charging power of some stadium bound alternative heavy melodics. This is a tight attack of thickly wedged guitars and intelligent guitar solos.\\" On 28 February 2011, the band announced that \\"ISO\\" would be appearing on Classic Rock Magazine's May Edition covermount CD. The single's music video, directed by Ned Jackson, was \\"Video of the Day\\" on 21 April courtesy of Pure Rawk. On 28 June 2011, the band announced that their self-titled EP was to be released on 12 August, and would be accompanied by a headline launch show at Manchester Academy 3. The EP consists of three tracks: Ren√©e, Pretty Much and ISO, all of which were recorded at The Animal Farm in London during their October 2010 sessions. In his review of the EP, Colin Jackson of Loud Horizon wrote of Ren√©e, \\"It comes across as something between a stage production and a Freddie Mercury / Queen track, what with the dramatic little piano arpeggios in between the resounding guitars. Full marks for trying something different ‚Äì if this is a one-off track, then that‚Äôs quite brilliant.\\" Jon Ashley of Manchester Music wrote of Pretty Much, \\"‚ÄúPretty Much‚Äù offer(s) a consistency via infectious multi-layered guitars and Americanised metal pop ‚Äì it‚Äôs a formula that can‚Äôt fail in the right hands and Drama certainly have the right number of fingers and thumbs.\\" In the early months of 2013, the band decided to relaunch under the guise 'Curious Me'. After some branding concerns and difficulties with several PR companies the band decided to revert to the band name 'Drama' and released a mini-album with the title of 'Curious Me' on 19 August 2013 via Bandcamp. The album was recorded over 10 days in February 2012 at Outhouse Studios in Reading with producer John Mitchell. In October 2013, Classic Rock Magazine said of the album, \\"Alt. pop-rock, but blessed with a real sense of overview. It's 30 Seconds to Mars tunefulness meets Biffy Clyro vigour.\\"Classic Rock Magazine, October 2013 p.91. 2014‚Äìpresent: Beneath the Veil Following an 18 month hiatus, the band announced they were preparing to release their second EP - \\"Beneath the Veil\\" - featuring remastered versions of songs recorded in February 2012 at Outhouse Studios with producer John Mitchell. Sound Gordon and Heyes 'grew up on a diet of classic and progressive rock'. The band's influences include Rush and Muse. Literary figures are also cited as influences, including H. P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allan Poe and Stephen King. In numerous reviews, the band has been compared to a variety of artists, including Queen, Ozzy Osbourne, Led Zeppelin, Nickelback, 30 Seconds to Mars and Biffy Clyro.

The carnival takes place the last week in May (week 21) and is the largest carnival in Scandinavia (advertised as \\"the biggest carnival in northern Europe\\"). The Aalborg Carnival stands for a week and has three main carnival events: The Grand Parade, Battle of Carnival Bands and Children‚Äôs Carnival. The carnival week is for everyone ‚Äì both professional carnival groups, children and everybody who wants to act on his or her instincts and create their own costume and join the celebration of life.  A week of Carnival   The Grand Parade The Grand Parade is a carnival event that attracts about 100,000 people to the streets of Aalborg each year. About 15 professional carnival groups from all over the world open the parade and following them are thousands of people dressed out, dancing and celebrating life. The parade begins in four different sites in Aalborg. The different parts meet up downtown Aalborg and form one parade continuing to the city park Kildeparken. Here the Carnival Party continues for the rest of the day and the people can listen to live music, dance, see carnival shows and much more.  Battle of Carnival Bands  Earlier there was an international carnival celebration called Battle of Carnival Bands the day before the Grand Parade. Since around 2008 it has been the weekend before and name World of Carnival. Every year many carnival groups from all over the world travel to Aalborg to participate.  Children‚Äôs Carnival  The children also have their own carnival as several thousands of children of all ages dress up and march through the streets of Aalborg with their parents. During this special day the city park, Kildeparken is transformed into a magic world filled with experiences and thrills for the children.  History  Kirsti Thorvaldsen, Ebbe Lauridsen, Kaj Steensg√•rd and Bramwell Flyckt are the founders of the Carnival in Aalborg. In 1983, they organised the first carnival in Aalborg and in this context established the association, Aalborg Carnival. Bramwell Flyckt was elected chairman of the ginger group. His intention was to celebrate fantasy and the coming of spring through carnival traditions: a transformation of the city into a gigantic theatre with the citizens as actors, the street as the stage and the body as a dancing sculpture. Thus, in 1983, the Carnival Association was established as a grass-root organisation, and the very first Carnival in Aalborg was held in the centre of Aalborg on May 28, 1983. The carnival parade consisted of 5-10,000 participants. Since 1986, the association has had a secretariat to their disposal, which acts as an employment project. The secretariat, which collaborates with the board members and volunteers coordinates all of the association's events. After the carnival in 1987, the association found itself in a crisis. Parts of the board did not wish to continue the work and the number of members decreased. On behalf of the general assembly, Carl Anton Christensen and Bramwell Flyckt were granted authority to develop a new model for the carnival that should rely on the assistance of NFU -'Nordjyske Fritids og Ungdomsklubber' (Youth and Leisure centers of Northern Jutland). NFU decided to offer their support and to contribute with considerable manpower to the board's work. Thus, the Carnival Association rose again. Initially, Carnival in Aalborg was held in the centre of Aalborg. Due to the lack of safety in the centre and a substantial decrease in revenues, the board decided to move the event to the nearby park, Kildeparken.  Traditions   Carnival Theme  Every year, Carnival in Aalborg presents a different carnival theme, which lays down the guidelines for the carnival in question and opens up for a broad variety of costumes. The theme serves as a source of inspiration for the participants, but is not a demand - all costumes are welcome. Themes throughout the years: * 2020: When I Grow Up... * 2019: The four seasons * 2018: By land, water and air * 2017: The world is full of... * 2016: Once upon a time... * 2015: Taboo * 2014: Trends of the time * 2013: Angels and Demons * 2012: The World Upside Down * 2011: Sexzoological Zoo * 2010: Mars and Venus. * 2009: La Dolce Vita - The sweet life. * 2008: Magic in the air. * 2007: Masquerade. * 2006: Exotic - Erotic. * 2005: The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep -and other Fairytales. * 2004: Atlantic. * 2003: Trends, trans & traditions. * 2002: Reflection. * 2001: Faith, Hope & Honesty. * 2000: New Horizon. * 1999: Where the Rainbow Ends. * 1998: Mother Sea. * 1997: Satire & Satyrs. * 1996: East of the Sun and West of the Moon. * 1995: Fertility and Colour. * 1994: Nordic for 1000 years. * 1993: Nordic for 1000 years. * 1992: Mask, Myth and Music.  The Carnival Poster  Since the very start of the Aalborg Carnival, an annual carnival poster has been produced. Most years, the carnival poster has been found through a contest between both professional and amateur artists. Every year, the carnival poster is exhibited in any different places all over North Jutland and is seen by thousands of people during the Carnival time.  Carrus Navalis  Every year when the sun regains its strength and the vernal equinox promises that spring is coming, the pageant Carrus Navalis moves through the streets of Aalborg keeping an ancient tradition alive. The Carrus Navalis (Car-naval) parade in Aalborg is inspired by ancient pagan traditions and serves as a proclamation of spring, fantasy and fertility - and the start of a new carnival season. The pageant is composed of symbols and represents a part of an extensive carnival tradition that praises light‚Äôs triumph over darkness. The pageant is led by mask dancers and men with bells who chase away darkness, winter and evil spirits. Behind this first part of the pageant, the boat, Carrus Navalis, is drawn accompanied by both a captain and his sailors - all of them giving landlubbers a very hard time! Behind the boat a ploughman and a pair of yoke prepare the earth for sowing and the sowing man lays the seed so that new life can begin to grow. Nothing grows without the sun, and the sun is paid tribute to through an accurate copy of the Chariot of the Sun, which is carried as part of the pageant. Ending the pageant, cannons are targeting the coming of spring accompanied by music, samba rhythms, dancing and joy.

Ateliers de Constructions Electriques de Charleroi offered to build a European adoption of the PCC streetcar, although the necessary licenses for Scandinavia were held by Svenska J√§rnv√§gsverkst√§derna. The trams met all of Oslo Sporveier's demands, except their high power usage.Andersen & Kjenstad: 12 However, the downside was the high price and that foreign production would require currency exchange licenses, which could be complicated because part of the price was for royalties.Andersen & Kjenstad: 13 The second offer came from Str√∏mmens V√¶rksted and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri, for an enlarged model of the Class 1947 being built for the Bergen Tramway. It was a variant of a standardized tram built by Brown, Boveri & Cie. for the Swiss tram market. The final offer was from H√§gglund and H√∏ka for a variant of H√§gglund's Mustang. These were in various versions being delivered to the tramways in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm√∂.Andersen & Kjenstad: 14 Tram 204 serving the Kjels√•s Line at the intersection at Storo in 1978 Oslo Sporveier opted for H√∏ka and H√§gglund's bid and in 1950 signed an agreement to buy thirty motorized units with delivery in 1952, at 250,000 Norwegian krone per unit. H√∏ka held the Norwegian rights to a Czechoslovakian patent for wooden-filled steel profiles that H√§gglund used in its design. The bodies were therefore built by H√∏ka in H√∏nefoss, while H√§gglund built the electrical and mechanical components. Final assembly was carried out by H√§gglund and Oslo Sporveier at Sagene Depot in Oslo. The first tram arrived in Oslo on 1 September 1952 and, after final assembly and tests, entered revenue service on 11 November 1952.Andersen & Kjenstad: 19 The trams were first used on Line 13, which ran from the Sagene Line via Stortorvet to the Kjels√•s Line. Half the original series was delivered by April 1953, allowing other lines to also use the new trams. The final tram of the original delivery series entered service on 14 December 1953.Andersen & Kjenstad: 20 Upon delivery the trams had some issues with the controller. Upon occasion they would move to full speed or full break without being activated by the motorman, causing a few minor accidents. It turned out that this was caused by a combination of mechanical weakness and user errors.Andersen & Kjenstad: 21 A \\"Chicken\\" on the loop of the Sinsen Line in 1975 \\"Chickens\\" The original plan was to copy a concept from Stockholm, where the trams were run fast and frequently without trailers. However, Oslo Sporveier soon decided to prioritize operating costs and instead run trams and trailers. At first the company operated Class SS trailers, but these proved unsuitable in combination with the MBOs. Oslo Sporveier was not willing to pay the price for new trailers and therefore chose a combination whereby new bodies were built atop existing undercarriages. Two such contractions were built at Sagene Depot in 1953, designated TO52 and the first unit can into revenue service on 23 November.Andersen & Kjenstad: 22 A major issue with the trailers were doors which would not shut properly, often resulting with the trams running with open doors.Andersen & Kjenstad: 24 Oslo Sporveier was considering the need for new trams, but were concerned because of the new trams having costs about twice the price of a Gullfisk. This led them into the idea of converting older trams by keeping the most costly parts, such as motors and wheelsets. However, the trams would receive new and larger bodies and interior. The company approved that twenty units be built, stipulating that fifty would be converted should it prove successful. Of the initial order, twelve were to be built as trailers and eight as motorized trams. They received new controllers and new braking system, and were largely rebuilt from Class U and Class SS units. The motorized version was designated MO52. They quickly received the nickname Chickens (), as a pun of being smaller than units built at H√∏nefoss (literally \\"Hen Falls\\"). The trailers were nicknamed Stiffsleds ().Andersen & Kjenstad: 25 MO \\"Chicken\\" hauling a TO \\"Stiffsled\\" at Storo in 1975 The first Chicken, no. 33, was met with dissatisfaction by the employees. They were built without air brakes, which meant that the conductor would have to traverse a full tram to reach the emergency brake should the motorman fall unconscious. The railway authorities sided with the employees, requiring the company to rebuild the unit. A similar concern was raised concerning the trailers. As air brakes are fail safe, the trailers would automatically brake should the trailer become disconnected. With the need for pressurized air system in place, the advantages of pneumatic door were reaped. However, the pneumatics systems largely ate up the costs savings of rebuilding material.Andersen & Kjenstad: 26 Most of the work was carried out at Sagene Depot,Andersen & Kjenstad: 27 and was carried out between mid-1954 to 1958.Andersen & Kjenstad: 28 The Chickens were used on a limited number of routes, from 4 July 1954 on lines 0, 8 and 13, variously serving the Vippetangen Line, the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line, the Sagene Line and the Sinsen Line. From 1955 they also started running on the Rodel√∏kka Line. The TO trailers were usually run with the Chickens, although they were also hauled by the larger H√∏ka units. The tramway experienced that the Chickens did not have sufficient pneumatic capacity to keep a tram and trailer at ease while stopped on slopes, as separate compressors in the trailers were not installed. This made operating trailers with the Chickens a safety hazard and soon they were only seen i solitude.Andersen & Kjenstad: 29 B√∏ler in the 1960s Suburban prologue The Oslo Metro was approved of by the city council in 1951. It would consist of a common, underground section in the city center and above- ground lines in the suburbs. It was soon evident that one of the suburban lines, the Lambertseter Line, would be completed in the order of magnitude of a decade before it could be hooked to the Common Tunnel. A similar situation was true for the √òstensj√∏ Line, which had been completed as a tramway in 1923. Oslo Sporveier was therefore given the task of operating the lines as tramways until the metro could open. The company considered building additional MO and TO units and move the new bogie trams to the suburban lines, but the poor performance of the rebuilt units soon made the company change its mind.Andersen & Kjenstad: 30 Although Oslo Sporveier was determined to buy bogie trams, it considered options other than additional MBOs. A derivative of Stockholm's A24 was considered, as was a modernized Gullfisk with Vickers motors and two variations of H√§gglund trams. The company considered multiple- unit trams, which would allow for faster speeds, but opted against this due to an increased fault rate and higher maintenance.Andersen & Kjenstad: 31 A trial with the Gullfisk proved that it had low acceleration and speed and was shaking violently at high speeds, and the option was discarded. The company had two final options, additional MBO units or Vickers-based multiple units with bodies built by H√§gglund and H√∏ka, and motors from NEBB.Andersen & Kjenstad: 32 John Colletts plass in 1971. The tender was issued in 1953 for twelve trams and thirty trailers. H√∏ka and H√§gglund won the bid. All motorized units would be manufactured by H√∏ka, along with twelve trailers. The remaining eighteen trailers would be built by Str√∏mmens Verksted, due to lack of capacity at H√∏ka. Each trailer cost 190,000 kroner, while the motor units cost 317,500. The contract included an option for eight more motorized units‚Äîwhich was quickly redeemed. Deliveries started in 1956 and the first trailer was put into revenue service on 28 May and the trailer class designated TBO55. The motor units, designated MBO55, first entered service on 15 July 1957, for the opening of the Lambertseter Line.Andersen & Kjenstad: 34 A second batch was delivered from May through December 1958 and was designated MBO56. The total value of the SM53 series trams was 30 million krone.Andersen & Kjenstad: 35 A single Mustang B25 trailer was bought used from Stockholm in 1957, when the trams there were closed. The trailer had left-hand drive, but by simply running it \\"backwards\\" the doors were placed on the right side. It was numbered 581 and classified as STBO50.Andersen & Kjenstad: 36 MBO55 and -56 also had issues with the controllers and the lubrication of the gear boxes, and the issues were soon corrected. The most troubling issue was a swaying motion when running on the suburban Vignoles rails. The riders complained to no avail until several derailments made the management aware of the severity. A Gullfisk was test-run and found to have a much smoother ride. A horizontal suspension was added, which helped somewhat to reduce the swaying. This could only be installed on the newer MBO55 and -56 series, as MBO50 had a different bogie design. The issue was never corrected in a satisfactory way.Andersen & Kjenstad: 45 For a year between 1966 and 1967 the SM53 trams continued to run on the √òstensj√∏ Line (left), while the new T1000 trains of the Oslo Metro had taken over services on the Lambertseter Line. Early career With the second series delivered the SM53 units entered service on most of street tram lines. Two exceptions were the Kampen Line and the Vestbanen Line, both which were built for the older narrow profile and could not be used by the wider trams.Andersen & Kjenstad: 39 As the trams were unidirectional they required a balloon loop at the ends of each line, which was also lacking on the Kampen Line, and new track arrangement had to be built at V√•lerenga Depot and Majorstuen Depot. The issue was availed by the 1957 opening of Grefsen Depot, which was built for unidirectional trams.Andersen & Kjenstad: 40 The MBO50 units were rebuilt in 1959, whereby the back door was closed and the received the same interior as the new trams, with single seats all the way along the door side. The city council voted in 1960 to gradually close down the tramway and replace it with the metro and diesel buses. Operations could continue with the existing rolling stock, although all investments were halted. In the following eight years the least trafficked tram lines were closed.Andersen & Kjenstad: 46 SM53 was most commonly used on lines 1, 2, 7 and 11 in this period, specifically serving the Briskeby Line, the Frogner Line, the Ullev√•l Hageby Line, the Sinsen Line, the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line and the Kjels√•s Line, as well as the suburban lines. The Chickens were used on the Sagene Line.Andersen & Kjenstad: 47 The last SM53 ran on the Lambertseter Line on 17 May 1966 and on the √òstensj√∏ Line 29 October 1967, as these were converted to metro lines. From then all SM53s were stalled at Grefsen.Andersen & Kjenstad: 48 Nationaltheatret in 1971 Oslo Sporveier's management attempted to close the tram operations during the late 1960s. However, the \\"H√∏ka lines\\" 1, 2, 7 and 11 and the suburban Lilleaker Line and Ekeberg Line exceeded the combined traffic of all city buses. As long as the SM53 units were operational it would not pay to order 300 new buses needed to replace them.Andersen & Kjenstad: 53 Oslo Sporveier carried out a large-scale retirement of older twin-axle trams during the late 1960s, particularly between 1966 and 1968. By then the only remaining trams were SM53 and the Gullfisk.Aspenberg: 47 To cut costs, Oslo Sporveier considered during the late 1960s if it could introduce one-man operation and abolish the conductor during off-peak hours. This would require a redesign of the interior.Andersen & Kjenstad: 54 Inspiration was gathered from the Hamburg Tramway and unit 206 was rebuilt in 1970. However, the labor unions were opposed to the change, fearing for their jobs, and succeeded at vetoing the change. From 1971 one-man operations were introduced by B√¶rumsbanen on their Gullfisk units, creating a certain precedence for future conversion.Andersen & Kjenstad: 55 From 29 September 1974 the Lilleaker and Ekeberg Lines were combined as Line 9, and all available Gullfisk were moved there. Thus all street tram services were being served with SM53. However, there were soon a lack of Gullfisk, resulting in some of the H√∏ka trams reentering service on the suburban lines.Andersen & Kjenstad: 57 Original interior of an MBO unit First retirements The city council voted in February 1978 to not close the tramway and instead invest in new rolling stock. The first investment was three used M23 units from Gothenburg, which were technically nearly identical to SM53. Except for being underpowered, making them unsuitable for service on the Ekeberg Line, they worked well and Oslo Sporveier therefore decided to retire the Chickens and replace them with additional MBG and TBG trams and trailers.Andersen & Kjenstad: 65 Four more such pairs were delivered in 1980. The first two Chickens were retired at the end of the 1980 and were chopped in October 1981. With the delivery of the twenty-five first SL79 trams in 1982, the remaining Chickens could be retired on 1 September. No. 38 was preserved by Oslo Tramway Museum, while the rest of the units were scrapped in the course of the month. This was the last twin- axled trams to run in revenue service in Oslo.Andersen & Kjenstad: 66 Services on Line 9 were taken over by SL79 and all SM53 units returned to street service. The future of the tramway was still largely based on it being able to reduce costs. The easiest way to rationalize was to introduce one-man operations. The first rebuilt SM53, no. 245, entered one-man service in 1982, and by 19 February 1983 all conductors had been removed. The labor unions agreed to the plan under condition that the motorman's cabins were rebuilt to a more ergonometric layout.Andersen & Kjenstad: 67 Next the trailers were rebuilt to become unmanned. The first entered service on 22 April 1983, the last manned trailer, and thus last conductor on the tramway, ran on 8 June 1984. The MBG series became superfluous and four pairs were retired on 1 January 1984. The TO trailers were likewise retired between March 1984 and July 1985.Andersen & Kjenstad: 68 The last three Gothenburg trailers were kept and rebuilt to run with SM53 trams and remained in service until 1989.Andersen & Kjenstad: 69 Modernization Sk√∏yen in 1992 In a move to retire the last Gullfisk before their next main revision, Oslo Sporveier rebuilt some of the SM53 units to allow them again to run on the suburban lines. This time vertical suspension was installed between the bogies and axle box, finally solving the issue with the swaying. Other improvements included a car horn, a new pantograph and dead man's control. This gave Oslo Sporveier 50 trams and 33 trailers‚Äîand too few of the latter. This resulted in seven used S27 trams being bought from Gothenburg and designated TBG and entering service between 27 November 1985 and 16 January 1986. They received a new interior between 1990 and 1993.Andersen & Kjenstad: 72 By the 1980s the SM53 units were out of date and were dire need of renewal. Oslo Sporveier therefore carried out a trial with no. 261, which was upgraded at Sagene and completed on 23 June 1985. Conversion took four months and eleven units were rebuilt until 1991. The work involved rebuilding the front, installation of new doors and interior, and a new chopper-based controller and new electronics. They were designated S83.Andersen & Kjenstad: 70 Only one trailer were similarly rebuilt, and given the designation S86T. This proved to be expensive and gave little advantages and was not carried out on other units. However, smaller upgrades and new interiors were installed on 21 trailers in the same period.Andersen & Kjenstad: 71 SM83 in red livery in 1987. Oslo Sporveier experimented with an intermodal all-red fleet, but was met by massive protests by the city's population. During the 1980s Oslo Sporveier experimented with their livery. Some received a darker blue, either entirely or with a cream- colored upper section. Consultants had concluded that Oslo Sporveier should introduce a uniform red color with dark blue detailing on all modes of transport: buses, metro trains and trams. This went without protests on the other two modes, but when the trams were pained red it was met with a storm of protests and a unison public demanded that they retain their light blue color. This resulted in a new uniform light blue color scheme which was introduced on the SM83 units. Most of the SM53 retained their original colors.Andersen & Kjenstad: 73 Final years The second batch of SL79 trams was delivered in 1989 and 1990, allowing the first SM53 units to be retired. Three, nos. 237, 244 and 253, were rebuilt to maintenance of way mat√©riel and painted yellow. No. 245 was converted to a school tram. The main concern with the trams was that the insulation on the high-voltage wires was wearing off. They were placed in ducts which were also used for ventilation and heating, giving extra wear. As long as they were not touched the cables would remain intact. This was the start of the process of retiring the SM53 units.Andersen & Kjenstad: 74 SM83 at Muselunden 1996, in its final color scheme As part of construction work at Storo and Sinsen the tramway decided to lease used M25 trams from Gothenburg, designated SM91. These could be connected and run as bidirectional trams, avoiding temporary balloon loops. They proved to be in better condition than the SM53 units. The twenty original trams delivered from October 1991 to 1992 were supplemented a year later with fourteen additional units. This was thought to be sufficient to replace all the SM53 units. However, Oslo Sporveier soon realized that they needed more trams for an increase in services. In addition the SM91 units were troubled with technical faults. Still, the bulk of SM53 trams could be retired. No. 249 was sold to Stockholm for 1 krone, where it was designated Class A33 and numbered 700, and used on the heritage Djurg√•rden Line. In 1993 and 1994 a further seventeen units were retired, including no. 215 and 234 which were deposited at the Oslo Tramway Museum. This brought the number of revenue H√∏ka units to 28.Andersen & Kjenstad: 75 The type classifications were altered in 1992, and the trams renumbered in 1994. MBO50, -55 and -56 were all classified at SM53, S83 became SM83, TBO55 became ST55, S86T became ST86 and TBG became ST89. During the last years SM53s were only to be regularly used on Line 17, serving the Ullev√•l Hageby and Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line. However, they were used throughout the network, in part because almost all motormen had its type certification, in part because SM91 could not enter service on the suburban lines. By 1997 a further set of trams were scrapped, with nine SM53 and ten ST55 units remaining. The 1995 ordering of new SL95 trams was planned as the coup de gr√¢ce for SM53.Andersen & Kjenstad: 77 In 1997 the high-voltage cable issue was regarded as so severe that the company decided that they either would have to be replaced for the trams scrapped. On 12 September a tram lost its brakes and the following day all SM53 trams were taken out of service.Andersen & Kjenstad: 76 Investigations showed that the braking systems would have to be rebuilt similar to SM83. This was too expensive and the trams never ran in revenue service again. One trailer received the new bogies for the SL95 and was hauled around Oslo by a SL79 for testing. The last of the non-preserved SM53s were scrapped in July 1998.Andersen & Kjenstad: 79 Tram 259 was preserved as it was the only unit to have received a new cable. The only preserved trailer is no. 563, built by Str√∏mmen.Andersen & Kjenstad: 80 The SM83, ST86 and ST89 were not subject to the cable and braking issue and were therefore kept in service. Originally Oslo ordered seventeen SL95s and planned to keep either the SM83 or the SM91 units. However, the options for another fifteen SL95s was redeemed, allowing all non-articulated trams to be retired. As the SL95 units were delivered, retirement of SM83 commenced in mid 1999. The choice to retire SM83 before SM91 was both that the former were in worse technical condition and that the need to raise the voltage on the tramway to 750 volts. SM91 had proven that it could adapt to such in Gothenburg, an outcome that the SM83 could not be sure of duplicating.Andersen & Kjenstad: 81 With the completion of the delivery of SL95 in 1999 and 2000 the SM83 units could be retired. No. 207 and 586 were preserved at the Oslo Tramway Museum and tram 210 was passed on to the Djurg√•rden Line. Tram 201 and trailer 589 were sent to a heritage museum in Gothenburg and in the last minute tram 203 was issued to the Danish Tramway Museum. By March 2000 the plan was to have retired all the trams, but delays of the SL95 units caused the retirement date to be postponed to 3 June 2000. The following day the voltage was increased. Specifications SM53 no. 235 at Muselunden in 1980 The trams each had four H√§gglund MBL10 300-volt serial direct current electric motors. They were connected two and two in series to match the system's 600 volt power supply via the overhead wire. The motors were robust and caused very few technical faults. Each motor produced an output of , which allowed for a maximum speed of . A fully loaded tram and trailer could reach a speed of up the steepest hills. The MO (Chicken) units inherited Siemens D58wf motors with a power output of .Andersen & Kjenstad: 126 The controller was a joint design by Allm√§nna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget and H√§gglund, designated CMBK4. It was equipped with four cylinders. Those controlling the speed and braking were connected to each other and the controlled by the motorman by a wheel. The cylinders controlling the direction and disconnection of the motors were controlled by a lever. They were connected such that the main cylinder and the speed/braking cylinders had to be set to zero to disconnect the motors or change direction. The speed/braking controller had 24 levels. The reason for introducing a wheel was to allow the driver to man it with either hand and give it a more ergonomic location, as the motormen's job was to a greater degree to manoeuver the tram in traffic rather than a more technical control of the vehicle.Andersen & Kjenstad: 127 The trams were unidirectional, but to allow them to back there were controls at the back of the vehicles, hidden within a hatch. It had three buttions, controlling speed, braking and emergency braking.Andersen & Kjenstad: 130 The trams were equipped with two H√§gglund-built H-bogies. They had an outer frame with the motor axles parallel with the wheel axles. Each axle had four rubber suspensions as its primary suspension.Andersen & Kjenstad: 123 The carriage rested on the bogie on rubber plates. Later the bogies were supplemented with a shock absorber. The motors were connected to the wheel axles via a universal joint and a gear. The wheels were rubber suspended, but were later replaced with steel-suspended axle boxes which required less maintenance.Andersen & Kjenstad: 124 The trams had a primary dynamic braking controlled through 12 stages. There are also pneumatic drum brakes,Andersen & Kjenstad: 132 although they are only used for parking, braking form the back end and for a passenger-induced emergency brake. The MO units were instead equipped with clasp brakes controlled by pneumatics. Trailers were equipped with solenoid brakes, but lacked a parking brake as it was found that the motor unit's holding brake was sufficient.,Andersen & Kjenstad: 134 In addition all units had an emergency rail brake. The trams were connected with Albert couplers.Andersen & Kjenstad: 135 The cars were built with welded, closed studding filled with wood. The roof had thick steel plates which were welded to the roof arches. The roof and studdings were all part of the carcass. The outside of the vehicles were clad with thick aluminum plates. Between there were placed of fire retardant insulation and then a layer of Insulitt, a layer of air and a new plate of Insulitt. The inside was clad in brown hardboard, with aluminum plats under the windows. The floor was a welded section of steel U-profiles, with a wooden floor covered with felt paper and linoleum. There were soon replaced with rubber flooring. The front of the vehicle had a steel plate which the controller to which the controller was fastened. This area doubled as a collision zone.Andersen & Kjenstad: 120 The units have four-abreast seating, with seats originally upholstered in dark blue leather.Andersen & Kjenstad: 118 The interior was largely covered in aluminum and brown-painted plates. The window frames were covered in aluminum. The air ducts were at first painted brown, but passengers had a tendency to rest their feet on them. They were therefore kept unpainted.Andersen & Kjenstad: 119 The motorman's cab was sealed off with an aluminum and plexiglas wall, later changed to a non-translucent aluminum to avoid reflections. The trams were originally constructed with an entrance through the back door and exit through the middle and front doors. The conductor was seated at the back and the passengers would enter a platform before passing by the conductor.Andersen & Kjenstad: 117 This was opposite on the trailers, which had the entrance at the front. This allowed for a common boarding area, which had the psychological effect of encouraging passengers to a greater extent board the trailer.Andersen & Kjenstad: 23 The vehicles were equipped with blinker doors. MBO consisted of double doors at the front and back, and a single door in the middle. The first two TO units had the same design, while the remaining trailers had only single exit doors. The vehicles were not built with compartments. Ventilation ducts ran through the gaps in the body and through the cable duct under the floor. They had openings in the floor and under the windows. The ventilation system doubled as cooling for the braking resistances. During cold weather the carriage air could be routed via the resistance to heat it, and warm and cold air could be mixed at various levels.Andersen & Kjenstad: 121 As there was no resistance in the trailers, these were equipped with electric heaters. The trams had a 24-volt lighting system with cabin lighting from fluorescent lamps.Andersen & Kjenstad: 122 References Bibliography  Category:Oslo Tramway stock Category:Vehicles introduced in 1952 Category:1952 establishments in Norway Category:2000 disestablishments in Norway ","title":"SM53"},{"id":"24054930","text":"Piyaneni is a classic Sri Lankan pop song composed by the Sri Lankan musician, Clarence Wijewardena.

R. Panthulu. It features Sivaji Ganesan leading an ensemble cast consisting of N. T. Rama Rao, S. A. Ashokan, R. Muthuraman, Devika, Savitri and M. V. Rajamma. The film is based on the story of Karna, a character from the Hindu epic Mahabharata. Karnan, which was officially launched in 1963, was shot in palaces at Jaipur and the war sequences were filmed in Kurukshetra, which featured several soldiers from the Indian Army. The film's original soundtrack was composed by the duo Viswanathan‚ÄìRamamoorthy, while the lyrics were written by Kannadasan. The screenplay was written by A. S. Nagarajan and the dialogues by Sakthi T. K. Krishnasamy. Karnan was released on 14 January 1964, during the festival occasion of Pongal. The film ran for over 100 days in theatres, and later won the Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film at the 11th National Film Awards. It was considered a milestone in Tamil cinema as it brought together the then leading actors of South Indian cinema, Ganesan and Rama Rao. The film was also partly responsible for a resurgence in Hindu mythological films in the industry. A digitised version of Karnan was released in March 2012 to critical and commercial success.  Plot  The unmarried princess Kunti is seen taking away a small coffin with a baby boy; she earlier got a boon from Durvasa for her pious service to him. Kunti could invoke a mantra and be blessed with a child from any male god of her choice. When she tested it playfully, she was blessed by the Sun with the baby, which she abandons in the Ganges to avoid embarrassment. The baby is rescued and adopted by royal charioteer Adhirathan, and later named Karnan. Years later, Karnan feels heartbroken upon realising that Adhirathan is only his adoptive father. Not wanting to become a charioteer like him, he instead chooses to become a warrior, travels to another kingdom and trains there. Four years later, having mastered archery, Karnan returns home. At the same time, the royal exhibition is held to portray the valour of royal princes, who have just completed education from Dronachariar. Once there, Karnan challenges the Pandava prince Arjunan in an archery contest, as everyone there hails Arjuna as the best archer ever. Karnan is insulted and refused a chance because of his lowly birth, but the Kaurava crown prince and cousin of the Pandavas, Duryodhanan, saves his pride, and crowns Karnan as the king of Anga. Karnan thus becomes the close friend of Duryodhanan and his wife Bhanumati. One day, Indran, disguised as a Brahmin, approaches Karnan and asks for his armour and ear ornaments as alms to weaken and prevent him from overpowering Arjuna. Although aware of Indra's intention, Karnan still gives both of the articles that he was born with and which made him invincible. Pleased with Karnan's generosity, Indra gives him a powerful weapon, the Nagastra. Disguised as a Brahmin, Karnan becomes the student of Parashuramar to acquire the Brahmastra; Parashuramar eventually realises that Karnan is a Kshatriya, a tribe he opposes. Enraged, he renders Karnan incapable of using the Brahmastra when most needed, and banishes him. Karnan later saves princess Subhangi from an uncontrolled chariot; they fall in love and eventually marry. A few years later, Krishnan, a supporter of the Pandavas, learns about Karnan's true background. He tells Kunti that Karnan is her first-born son. Karnan also learns about his birth later. Kunti meets Karnan and gets two wishes from him, one that he will not attack any of her sons (the Pandavas) except Arjunan during the impending Kurukshetra War, and that he will attack Arjunan with the Nagastra only once. Karnan refuses to join the Pandavas and remains the friend of their enemy Duryodhanan. Before the war begins, Duryodhanan's ministers assemble to appoint the commanders of the army divisions. Bhishmar is appointed the Commander and he starts nominating generals for different battalions. Karnan is insulted because of his lowly birth and given the command of a low rank infantry. The war begins and in the early days, Bhishma retires and Karnan replaces him. The following day, Karnan goes to war accompanied by his son Vrishasenan who fights bravely, but is killed by Arjunan. The next day, Karnan tries to kill Arjunan with the Nagastra, but Krishnan prevents the weapon from hurting him. Since Karnan cannot use the Nagastra more than once, he is unable to kill Arjunan. A wheel of his chariot gets stuck in a hole, and he steps down to relieve it. Under Krishnan's direction, Arjunan shoots multiple arrows at Karnan that severely wound him, but Karnan still stays alive. Krishnan tells a shocked Arjunan that the Dharma that Karnan performed during his lifetime was protecting his life. Krishnan disguises as a Brahmin, goes to Karnan and asks him his virtues as donation. Karnan generously donates all his virtues to the \\"Brahmin\\". Arjunan then shoots a few more arrows at Karnan that kill him. The Pandavas, who realise that Karnan was their eldest brother, mourn his death. Kunti does the same, while Subhangi dies, traumatised by her husband's death. Arjunan remorses killing Karnan, until Krishnan reveals that the curses by Indran and Parashuramar were also responsible for his death. The film ends with Karnan meeting his father the Sun in the afterlife.  Cast  Cast according to the opening credits of the film * Sivaji Ganesan as Karnan * N. T.

Saroja as Young Kunti  Production   Development  Karnan was the first film to be shot at the Bangalore Palace. Karnan is based on the life of the character Karna from the Hindu epic Mahabharata, and was officially launched in 1963 at Vijaya Studios in Chennai. B. R. Panthulu, who directed and produced the film under the banner Padmini Pictures, had collected most of his information from scholars Kripananda Variar and Anantarama Dikshitar. The film's art director was Ganga, and the cinematographer was V. Ramamurthy. Sakthi T. K. Krishnasamy wrote the dialogues, and A. S. Nagarajan wrote the screenplay. R. Devarajan was the editor.  Casting  Sivaji Ganesan was cast in the title role, Telugu actor N. T. Rama Rao as Krishnan, and R. Muthuraman as Arjunan. Actresses Devika and Savitri were cast in the female lead roles, and S. A. Ashokan as Karna's friend Duryodhanan. The role of Karna's mother Kunti was portrayed by M. V. Rajamma, and actress Sandhya played Karna's mother-in-law. Other supporting cast members included actor Shanmugasundaram as the charioteer Salliya Chakravarthy, V. S. Raghavan as Vidhurar, actresses Kalpana and Jayanthi, and the then six-year-old Master Sridhar as Meganathan, an orphan who meets Karnan after being accused of setting fire to a school. Actor K. V. Srinivasan played a minor role as the sage who christens the lead character as Karnan. He also dubbed for the voice of Rama Rao, after Ganesan's insistence with Panthulu.  Filming  Karnan was filmed with an estimated budget of 4 million (valued at about US$840 000.84 in 1964). The high cost of the film was attributed to the transportation costs incurred to move chariots from Chennai to Kurukshetra, where the war sequences were filmed. Permission from the government was sought, cavalry and infantry from the Indian Army were brought to the locations at Kurukshetra and the first rows of the charging armies on horses and elephants had soldiers from the Indian Army. The battle scenes were shot with troupes of the 61 Cavalry Regiment, using 80 elephants, 400 horses and three cameras. Other scenes were shot at palaces in Jaipur. Sridhar finished his long scene in one take, and was paid 1000 (valued at about US$210 in 1964) for the performance. Shooting for Karnan also took place at the Bangalore Palace in the Cantonment area, making it the first film to be shot there. In 2012, Panthulu's son Ravishankar revealed that a few shots involving Ganesan and Rama Rao took as many as four days to shoot, because of the large number of personnel involved. After the release of Karnan, all the chariots made for the war sequences in Kurukshetra, were donated to the Brihadisvara Temple, Thanjavur. The film was processed at Filmcenter in Bombay, and its final length was .  Music  Viswanathan‚ÄìRamamoorthy (a duo consisting of M. S. Viswanathan and T. K. Ramamoorthy) composed the music of Karnan, while the lyrics were written by Kannadasan. The songs were recorded using various instruments like Sarangi, Santoor, Shehnai, Dilruba and others that were rarely used in Tamil films. The songs \\"Ullathil Nalla Ullam\\" and \\"Aayiram Karangal\\" were written first and tuned later; for the other songs, Kannadasan wrote lines to fit the tune. He completed all the lyrics for the songs in two days. The entire soundtrack was completed within three days. The songs are set in various Hindustani and Carnatic ragas: \\"En Uyir Thozhi\\" is set in Hamir Kalyani, \\"Maharajan\\" in Kharaharapriya, \\"Kangal Engey\\" in Suddha Dhanyasi, \\"Iravum Nilavum\\" in Shuddha Sarang, \\"Ullathil Nalla Ullam\\" in Ahir Bhairav, \\"Poi Vaa Magale\\" in Anandabhairavi, \\"Kannuku Kulam Yedu\\" in Pahadi, and \\"Naanichivandhana\\" in Darbari Kanada.  Release  Karnan was released on 14 January 1964 during the festival occasion of Pongal, and Ganesan's own Shanti Theatre in Chennai, which released the film, had a tall banner of a chariot to attract the audience. Ganesan promoted the film by distributing Chakarai Pongal (sweetened rice) to those who came to Shanti to attend the first screening. The film was dubbed in Telugu as Karna, and also in Hindi as Dhaan Veer Karna.  Reception   Critical reception  The critic from The Indian Express wrote on 17 January 1964, \\"Reproducing the incidents from the Mahabharatha, the film has all the aspects demanded by the subject\\", adding that Panthulu had not spared any effort to do justice to the theme, and was appreciative of Ganga's art direction and Ramamurthy's cinematography. The critic from Ananda Vikatan wrote that while the film's effort to improve the quality of Tamil cinema quality was praiseworthy, they could not see the dignity of the epic, only the dominance of the extravaganza. In a review dated 8 February 1964, T. M. Ramachandran of Sport and Pastime praised the film's extravaganza but added, \\"What fundamentally makes a film truly great is its absorbing presentation without a dull moment. This aspect seems to have been lost sight of by the makers.\\" Despite being released theatrically in 1964, the film won the Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film at the 11th National Film Awards, which honoured films released in 1963.  Box office  In its theatrical run, Karnan completed 100 days in four theatres, including Madurai Thangam (noted as the second largest theatre in Asia during 1964), and Shanthi. In spite of a successful run after completing 80 days, the film was removed from twelve theatres to allow the release of Pachai Vilakku, another Sivaji Ganesan film. At Madurai Thangam, Karnan earned totally 186,805.62 after its 14-week run there. Despite the film running for over 100 days in theatres, critics like Baradwaj Rangan and The Times of India's M. Suganth state that the film was a box office failure during its release.  Home media  Karnan was released on DVD by Raj Video Vision. A \\"5.1 Channel EDS Sound\\" enhanced version was also released by the same company, featuring English subtitles. Karnan is also included alongside various Sivaji Ganesan- starrers in the compilation DVD 8 Ulaga Adhisayam Sivaji, which was released in May 2012.  Re-release  A digitally restored version of Karnan was released on 16 March 2012, to commemorate the birth centenary of Panthulu. It is the first Tamil film to be fully digitally restored, costing and consuming an effort of three years. The effort was undertaken by film distributor Shanthi Chokkalingam, who stated, \\"The sound negative was totally gone and the five to six reels from the picture negative were damaged to a great extent\\". Shanthi, who had previously re-released many of M. G. Ramachandran's films, chose to re-release Karnan because of \\"the emphasis it places on friendship and loyalty\\". The digital restoration of Karnan took place at Sangeetha Sound Studios in Chennai, after a failed attempt with the Mumbai-based Famous Studios, who earlier restored the 1960 Hindi film Mughal-e-Azam. Visual improvements and audio restoration were excessively worked upon, with Shanthi stating that the \\"biggest challenge was to restore the background score\\". DVDs were also used to get the sound and music in its original form. To create awareness about the restoration of Karnan, a teaser trailer was launched on 21 February 2012, which received a positive response. The restored version of Karnan which utilised DTS 5.1 surround sound, was released in 72 screens across Tamil Nadu, and was released by Shanthi's Divya Films. It was well received upon release, although M. Suganth called the restoration process \\"far from perfect\\", and Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \\"The print occasionally judders, leaving the impression of watching the movie on a screen mounted behind the driver's seat in an auto rickshaw\\". Taking a big opening, the film collected roughly in Chennai within the first few weeks, and was later reported to have collected a total of . It had a theatrical run of over 100 days, and having surpassed what it originally managed to collect in its entire 105-day run at Shanthi theatre, the film was officially declared a commercial success. Its success soon established a trend of digitising and re-releasing films in Tamil cinema.  Legacy  Karnan was considered a milestone in Tamil cinema as it brought together the then leading actors of South Indian cinema, Sivaji Ganesan and N. T. Rama Rao. Along with Ganesan's later film Thiruvilaiyadal (1965), it was responsible for a resurgence in Hindu mythological films, since it was released at a time when Tamil cinema primarily made social films. Actor Y. G. Mahendran said, \\"Karnan can never be remade. Nobody can replace any of the actors of the 1964 classic, and it would amount to mockery if it is done.\\" Actor Rana Daggubati, in an interview with Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu, said that Ganesan's performances as Kattabomman and Karna served as inspirations for his role in Baahubali: The Beginning (2015).

It is set in the Third Crusade and focuses on a Saracen boy named Salim and an English boy called Adam. It was shortlisted for the 2007 Costa Children's Book Award.  Plot  For a year and a half, Acre is besieged by the Frankish army, while the Sultan's camp is close by. In an incredible twist of fate, Jennet's ship reappears and she arrives to Adam with baby Tibby, the daughter of Robert de Martel. By chance, Adam and Faithful stumble across Salim, who was watching Acre in a spell of homesickness. Adam becomes a serf for Sir Ivo, and works as a groom and later becomes a squire. Salim takes to watching the Frankish camp as often as possible until he gets caught by Saracen soldiers who believe him to be a spy for the franks, however when they return with him to Saladin's camp his identity is discovered. When Saladin realises how much information Salim has learned about the Frankish army, he is told to continue to watch them as long as he doesn't get caught. The Mamluk Ismail uses Salim's information to plan an ambush on the soldiers nearest the edge of the camp. The Mamluks provoke the Martel soldiers by yelling insults while on horses. The knights immediately prepare for battle, eager to leave the camp. Sir Guy de Martel ignores advice from Sir Ivo, who believes they are going to ride straight into an ambush. All of the knights from the Martel army ride to battle, swiftly followed by their squires and other foot soldiers. Adam runs to Sir Ivo's help and Faithful tries to follow but gets ordered to return to the camp. However, Adam doesn't see Faithful start running with him again, instead of returning to the camp. When they arrive to the ambush, the knights are already fighting the Mamluks. Two Mamluks are attacking Sir Ivo, one of them is trying to make his horse, Grimbald, rear while the other is trying to attack him with a sword. Faithful bites the Mamluk trying to make Grimbald rear, which later turns out to be Ismail, while Sir Ivo kills the other. The Mamluks retreat with four Frankish prisoners of war. Faithful starts barking at Sir Guy de Martel's horse, Vigor, and Adam hurriedly pulls him away and sends him back to the camp. When he turns back he discovers Vigor has reared and Guy de Martel has fallen to the ground. In an act of chivalry, Saladin sends Dr. Musa and Salim to try to heal Sir Guy, who has a serious head injury and remains unconscious. One of the prisoners is sent with him with the threat that if he failed to return, or if he allowed Dr. Musa and Salim to be harmed, the other prisoners would be killed. Dr. Musa meets Dr. John, a Frankish doctor who lived all his life in the Holy Land, and Dr. Nicholas. Unlike Dr. John, Nicholas believes a demon has entered Sir Guy's body and that's why he remains unconscious, and the only way to save him is to let the demon from his body. Dr. John and Musa know he has no demon on his body and they eventually win the right to treat Sir Guy instead of Nicholas. They manage to repair the damage and, although Sir Guy survives, he isn't returned completely to normal. For a while, he only remained conscious for a small amount of time each day. It was in one of these brief moments that he told Adam he was really his father. Sir Robert de Martel refuses to believe he is related to Adam and believes Adam is a witch and has put a spell on Sir Guy. Eventually he is forced to accept it. A little while after the accident, Adam leaves morning mass early to talk to his father and admits it was his dog who caused Vigor to rear and Sir Guy sees it as punishment for his sins. Just a few days after Adam admits this, Sir Guy has a seizure and while Dr. John is in a different part of the army Dr. Nicholas, still certain a demon has entered Sir Guy's body and caused the fit, is left to do what he thinks will help. He cuts open Sir Guy's head to release the demon and Sir Guy dies rapidly. When Dr. Musa hears of the death he is furious at Dr. Nicholas' decision. Sir Ivo and Adam are grateful that Dr. Musa came to help Sir Guy, and they travel to the Saracen camp to ask them if there was anything they could do for them. Dr. Musa mentions that Salim's family is still in the castle of Acre and asks for a safe passage for them through the camp. Sir Ivo does as they asked but Ali, a part of the garrison of Acre, chooses to remain in the castle to help defend Acre against the Frankish army. When back in Saladin's camp, Salim's mother reveals her plans to go to Damascus where her brother lives, using money a friend gave her just before she left. Just days after the family escaped, Acre's walls fall and the army attacks the city. While waiting for the walls to finally fall, Adam and the rest of the army prepare to go inside siege towers. Jennet is nearby, handing out water to the stifling soldiers. While they are all waiting for the attack, one of the towers is hit by Greek Fire. Adam and the rest of the soldiers hurriedly got away from the tower before they were harmed, but it fell on Jennet and she quickly died. Adam helps in the attack when the walls finally fall, but he is hit by an object while climbing over the remnants of the crumbled wall. He is carried back to safety by Sir Ivo. He later wakes up in Acre's hospital but it is a few weeks before he is strong enough to leave the hospital. Here he discovers a woman called Joan is looking after since Jennet's death. He offers to pay her enough to leave her job and go to his own new estate, to which she agrees. A little while after this, Tibby goes missing and Adam searches for her everywhere, only to discover Jacques has sold her to slavers. Salim, Dr. Musa and their body guard and groom, Tewfik are told they can finally travel to Jerusalem. While they are leaving, Adam finds them and convinces them to help find Tibby. They give Adam a skullcap and Damascus tunic to help him pass as a Kurd while travelling to find the slavers in Jerusalem. He is told to pretend to be deaf and dumb so no one realises he is really a Frank. They never reach Jerusalem but they find Tibby and Adam narrowly escapes with her. When he returns he is jailed for abandoning Sir Ivo, who was badly wounded in his absence. Eventually, he is released and allowed to return to England. While waiting to board the ship, Adam tells everyone that Jacques is a cheat and he starts to chase Jacques along with several more people. He is then found by a messenger who gives him is bond of freedom to go to his new estate at Brockwood. At Dr. Musa's home in Jerusalem, a group of Mamluks including Ismail appear and say Saladin wants them to return. Dr. Musa refuses to return to the army, but tells the Mamluks Salim knows just as much as he does. Salim, who longs to return to the army, is given a turban by Dr. Musa which prompts Ismail to call him brother instead of little brother. With the Mamluks, Salim rides back to Saladin's army. Ten years on, Adam is the master of Brockwood, he manages his estate well with Tom Bate (Jennet's father), as his right-hand man, and he married a miller's daughter, who is called Margaret. They have three sons and Faithful has puppies. Sir Ivo is a frequent visitor. Adam never finds out Dr. Musa died quietly five years after Saladin saved Jerusalem, while reading a book in the courtyard of his home. Salim cried when he heard the news, and after years of training he is a well-respected doctor. He looks after his family and lives in a house in Damascus with his wife, Leila and two daughters. He keeps a Mamluk-trained horse in his stable and sometimes saddles it up for a ride to be on his own. Ismail is captain of his own Mamluk troop and often sends Salim greetings and news. Characters  Salim  Salim Ibn Adil is a boy from the mighty town of Acre. When news that a Frankish army is arriving soon sweeps through the town, his father makes him leave as Dr. Musa's apprentice to get to safety in Damascus. While they are escaping, a small unit of Franks forces them to hide by a farmstead's outer wall at the top of a hill. They are almost discovered by the Franks when a small force of Mamluks appears and chases the Franks away without seeing Salim, Dr. Musa and their mule Suweida. They try to keep hidden while the Mamluks are there but Suweida gives away their position. The Mamluks take them to Sultan Saladin's camp as they are in need of a doctor. Here, Salim befriends a Mamluk named Ismail.  Adam  Adam is a fourteen-year-old English boy. After his mother dies, he becomes convinced that the only way to guarantee her soul to Paradise is to scatter the dust of Jerusalem on her grave. Jacques the pedlar sells him some of this special soil but, after Adam spent his only penny on the bottle of soil, he discovers it is ordinary dirt from England. After his mother's death, he becomes a dog boy in service of the lord guy. When war is announced, Adam is inspired to take up the cross and travel to the Holy Land to obtain the dust of Jerusalem for his mother. The Lord selects him as one of the people to travel to the Holy Land, hoping for some good hunting on the way there. Before they leave for the Holy Land, Adam is given a mastiff he then names Faithful. During their trip, most of the dogs die of illness while Faithful is the only one remaining by the time they arrive at Acre. His closest friend, named Jennet, is on a separate ship to him and to Adam's horror; the ship is lost during a terrible storm.

He earned a doctoral degree in philosophy from the University of Jena in 1799, obtaining habilitation one year later and teaching as Privatdozent until his early death from scarlet fever. His first poems appeared in Friedrich Schiller's Musenalmanach. The appearance in 1800 of his ten Letters on a Reassessment of Friedrich Schlegel's \\"Lucinde\\" brought him to the attention of the author in question; however, in general, criticism of the 350-page work was biting, and it was quickly superseded by Friedrich Schleiermacher's Vertraute Briefe (\\"Familiar letters\\") on the same subject. With Schlegel's assistance, Vermehren produced two issues of his own Musenalmanach, the first at Leipzig in 1802 and the second at Jena the next year. They contained fifteen poems by Schlegel and the work of Sophie Mereau (1770‚Äì1806), Stephan August Winkelmann (1780‚Äì1806), Klopstock and H√∂lderlin. Family tradition ascribed to him the book Jesus, wie er lebte und lehrte which was published in Halle in 1799, and in the last year of his life he wrote a fairy-tale, \\"Schloss Rosenthal\\" (\\"Rosenthal Castle\\"). On 2 December 1803, Goethe mentioned the death slightingly in a letter to Schiller: \\"Poor Vermehren has died. Probably he would still be living had he continued writing his mediocre verse. The post office job has proved fatal.\\" Vermehren married on 20 April 1801. His wife was Henriette Eber, twelve years older, a widow of the Jena Postmaster and daughter of the privy councillor Prof. Johann Ludwig von Eckardt (1732‚Äì1800). They had one son, Johann Bernhard Vermehren, who would become a privy councillor in the Supreme Court of Appeals for the Ernestine duchies.

He is considered one of the best players ever to play for current Bundesliga side VfB Stuttgart. He also played three times for his national side. Growing up in Zuffenhausen (it was incorporated into Stuttgart in 1931), his youth club was local FV Zuffenhausen. In 1942, his side won the Junior Championships of the state of W√ºrttemberg. Late in World War II, he was called up into the Wehrmacht, fighting on the Eastern Front. After being shot into the jaw, he was dismissed and sent back home. In the 1944/45 season, he began playing, initially as a \\"guest player\\", for VfB Stuttgart. The war had taken five vital players from FV Zuffenhausen, which left the club unable to compete. Thus, Schlienz joined VfB permanently in the summer of 1945, as the Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt club took part in the newly founded semi-professional Oberliga S√ºd (South) from October 1945. In 1945‚Äì46, Schlienz, playing as centre forward, scored 46 goals in 30 games, becoming the record goal scorer in the Oberliga. But on 14 August 1948, he lost his left forearm (it had to be amputated) in a car accident travelling to a VfB cup match in Aalen. Devastated, he thought his career was finished, but his coach, Georg Wurzer, encouraged him to continue his career. Wurzer now positioned him in offensive midfield, as an inside forward, instead of centre forward. Schlienz made his comeback on 5 December 1948, against Bayern Munich. Despite being handicapped, he was now captain and playmaker at VfB Stuttgart, leading the team to win the German Championship twice in 1950 and 1952 (runner-up in 1953, losing to 1. FC Kaiserslautern) and the German Cup twice in 1954 and 1958. In 1955 and 1956, he earned three caps for (West) Germany under the famous coach Sepp Herberger. He ended his career in 1960 and subsequently moved to the village of Dettenhausen, about 20 miles south of Stuttgart, where he died and was buried in 1995.

The family includes the oldest known fossils of Sirenians, represented in two genera: *Pezosiren Pezosiren comprises one known species, Pezosiren portelli, that was discovered in modern day Jamaica. One of the earliest true Sirenian species, P. portelli is distinct from extant Sirenians due to its quadrupedal stature. The species is estimated to have lived 50 million years ago during the Mid Eocene, and the skeletal elements suggest that P. portelli was able to properly support its body weight while out of the water. However, several morphological features suggest that this species spent significant amounts of time in an aquatic environment, such as P. portelli's pachyosteosclerotic ribs. Similar to an extant manatee's ribs, these ribs provided a ballast and allowed the animal to achieve neutral buoyancy. P. portelli lacked the large, muscular tail used in modern Sirenians to propel through the water column, and skeletal anatomy suggests that they instead garnered propulsive force through spinal undulations, similar to otters. This evidence suggests that P. portelli likely divided its time between terrestrial habitats and shallow aquatic habitats, convergently akin to hippopotamuses. *Prorastomus The genus Prorastomus is also represented by only one known species. Prorastomus sirenoides lived in modern day Jamaica during the Mid Eocene, and it is thought to be the oldest Sirenian species discovered so far. Similar to P. portelli, this quadrupedal Sirenian likely displayed a lifestyle comparable to hippos, spending large amounts of time both in and out of water. The species was determined to have had relatively large olfactory bulbs for a Sirenian, suggesting that the sense of smell was of importance to P. sirenoides, and the trigenimal nerves, utilized in somatosensory, were found to be enlarged. Extant Sirenian species possess comparably large trigenimal nerves, allowing for highly sensitive facial tactility. Dentile fossils of P. sirenoides suggest that the species fed primarily on floating and emergent vegetation along its habitat.

Ancestors and early life He was a great-grandson of William Biddle, I (1630‚Äì1712), and Sarah Kempe (1634‚Äì1709), Quakers who emigrated to America in 1681. William Biddle was one of the Proprietors of West Jersey, and for many years a member of the Governor's Council of that colony. Owen was a grandson of William Biddle, II (1660‚Äì1743), and son of John Biddle, I, (1707‚Äì1789), who moved to Philadelphia about 1725 with his brother, William Biddle, III (b. 1698‚Äì1756). His father prospered as a merchant. After eight years of formal education, Owen Biddle became a clock and watchmaker. Patriot He was engaged in mercantile pursuits, and with his younger brother, Clement Biddle, signed the Non- importation Resolutions of October 25, 1765. He was a delegate to the Provincial Conference January 23, 1775; member of the Committee of Safety from June 30, 1775, to July 22, 1776, during which period he served as de facto Governor of Pennsylvania on July 4, 1776, again on July 8 and 10, 1776, and finally on July 16, 1776. Owen Biddle continued service with the newly constituted Council of Safety from July 24, 1776 to March 13, 1777. He became a member of the Board of War on March 13, 1777, and was a member of the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention of July 15, 1776. In June, 1777, he was appointed Deputy Commissary General of Forage, with the rank of Colonel, by the Continental Congress. He served under his younger brother, Clement, who was the Commissary General of Forage and also a Colonel, until August 15, 1780. He and his brother labored for three years to obtain provisions for the Continental Army's horses, mules and other draft animals, while struggling to obtain funds, working with unreliable subordinates, and many unresponsive farmers. Astronomy and science He was an early and active member of the American Philosophical Society, one of its curators from 1769 to 1772, and secretary from 1773 to 1782, when he became one of the councilors, continuing as such until his death. In 1782, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was one of the committee of thirteen appointed by the Society to observe the transit of Venus on June 3, 1769. These observations were made with eminent success by three members of the Committee, David Rittenhouse being stationed at Norristown, Dr. Ewins at Philadelphia, and Owen Biddle at Cape Henlopen, Delaware.

The scales shown here are lamellar. The pedicel can be seen attached to a few loose scales. The presence of scales on the wings of Lepidoptera, comprising moths and butterflies, characterises this order of insects. The name is derived from Ancient Greek ŒªŒµœÄŒØŒ¥ŒøœÇ (scale) and œÄœÑŒµœÅœåŒΩ (wing). The wings of Lepidoptera are minutely scaled, which feature gives the name to this order.Scoble, M.J. (2005). The Lepidoptera: Form, Function, and Diversity. Page 63. Accessed through Google books on 21 Aug 2009 Scales also cover the head, parts of the thorax and abdomen as well as parts of the genitalia.  Morphology  The morphology of scales has been studied by Downey & Allyn (1975) and scales have been classified into three groups, namely: * Hair-like or piliform. * Blade-like or lamellar. * Other variable forms. Primitive moths (non-Glossata and Eriocranidae) have 'solid' scales which are imperforate, i.e., they lack a lumen. As per Scoble (2005): The Trichoptera (caddisflies) which are a sister group of the Lepidoptera have scales, but also possess caudal cerci on the abdomen, a feature absent in the Lepidoptera.Powell, Jerry A. Lepidoptera (pp. 631-664) in Resh, V. H. & R. T. Card√© (Editors) 2003. Encyclopedia of Insects. Academic Press.  Structure  Though there is great diversity in scale form, they are structured similarly. The body or 'blade' of a typical scale consists of an upper and lower lamina. The surface of the lower lamina is smooth whereas the structure of the upper lamina is structured and intricate. Scales are attached to the substrate by a stalk or 'pedicel'.  Colour  The colouration of butterfly wings is created by the scales which are pigmented with melanins that give them blacks and browns, but blues, greens, reds and iridescence are usually created not by pigments but the microstructure of the scales. This structural coloration is the result of coherent scattering of light by the photonic crystal nature of the scales.Vukusic, P., J.R.Sambles, and H. Ghiradella (2000) Optical Classification of Microstructure in Butterfly Wing-scales. Photonics Science News, 6, 61-66 The scales cling somewhat loosely to the wing and come off easily without harming the butterfly.  Function  Scales play an important part in the natural history of Lepidoptera. Scales enable development of vivid or indistinct patterns which help the organism protect itself by concealment and camouflage, mimicry and warning. Besides providing insulation, dark patterns on wings provided by dark colour scales would allow sunlight to be absorbed and thus probably have a role to play in thermoregulation. Bright and distinctive colour patterns in butterflies which are distasteful to predators help communicate their aposematism (toxicity or inedibility) thus preventing a predator from preying on it. In Batesian mimicry, wing colour patterns help edible Lepidopterans mimic inedible models while in M√ºllerian mimicry inedible butterflies resemble each other to reduce the numbers of individuals sampled by predators. Scales possibly evolved initially for providing insulation. Scales on the thorax and other parts of the body probably contribute to maintaining the high body temperatures required during flight. The 'solid' scales of basal moths are however not as efficient as those of their more advanced relatives as the presence of a lumen adds air layers and increases the insulation value. Young adults of myrmecophilous Lepidoptera escape from ant's nests by virtue of the deciduous waxy scales with which they are covered when born. These scales rub off and stick on the ants as they make their way out of the nest after hatching. Scales greatly reduce fatalities among Lepidoptera after flying into spiderwebs. The detachable scales pull away freely and enable the insect to escape. (Forsyth 1992:12) Thomas Eisner tested spiderwebs' effectiveness by dropping various insects onto the webs. Moths were consistently able to escape, and all left impact spots where scales had stuck to the web. Eisner found these spots to be common. (Eisner 2003:218-220) Scales also help increase the lift to drag ratio in gliding flight.

It is the sixth of the Sc√®nes de la vie priv√©e (Scenes of Private Life) in La Com√©die humaine. The novel was serialized in the review La L√©gislature in 1842 under the title Le Danger des mystifications (The Dangers of Gasconade). In 1845 it appeared under its present title in the second Furne edition of La Com√©die humaine. Un d√©but dans la vie was the fifth work in Volume 4, or the twenty-fifth of the Sc√®nes de la vie priv√©e.Furne (1842-48). In Balzac's final arrangement of La Com√©die humaine, Un d√©but dans la vie is the sixth of the Sc√®nes da la vie priv√©e. History Balzac wrote Un d√©but dans la vie during one of his many visits to the commune of L'Isle-Adam in Val-d'Oise, a few kilometres north of Paris. The novel is based on a short- story by Balzac's sister Laure Surville, which was later published in 1854 under the title Le Voyage en coucou (The Journey in a Rickety Carriage). Balzac recast the story, transforming it into a profound study of human vanity and its consequences. The novel is dedicated to Laure with the words: > Let the brilliant mind that gave me the subject of this Scene have the honor > of it.Balzac, Un d√©but dans la vie, Dedication \\"To Laure\\", translated by > Katharine Prescott Wormeley. In 1841 Balzac drafted the first version of the story with a view to publication in the journal Le Mus√©e des familles. First entitled Les Jeunes gens (Young People) and then Le Voyage en coucou, the work was not to exceed 3,000 lines. The editor Piqu√©e, however, declined to publish it. The following year Balzac redrafted the story, expanding it to fourteen chapters, and it was serialized in La L√©gislature from 26 July to 6 September under the title Le Danger des mystifications. Three pirated Belgian editions of the work also appeared this year under the same title. In June 1844 the novel was published under its present title by Dumont. Largely unchanged from its serialization, the work appeared in a two-volume quarto edition, the second volume containing Balzac's La Fausse Ma√Ætresse (The Imaginary Mistress). In 1845 Un d√©but dans la vie was published in Volume 4 of Furne's second edition of La Com√©die humaine. In this version of the work Balzac greatly expanded Mistigris' arsenal of burlesque proverbs. (Three further proverbs were added to the corrected Furne edition.) Plot Honor√© de Balzac Much of the action of this short novel takes place in the rickety old stage-coach ‚Äî or coucou ‚Äî of Pierrotin, which regularly carries passengers and goods between Paris and Val-d'Oise. On one such trip from Paris, Comte Hugret de S√©rizy, a senator and wealthy aristocrat, is travelling incognito in order to investigate reports that Monsieur Moreau, the steward of his country estate at Presles, is being less than honest in his dealings on the count's behalf with a neighbouring landowner Margueron, a piece of whose land the count wishes to buy. Among the count's fellow passengers is Oscar Husson, a young good-for-nothing mummy's boy, who is being sent to a friend of his mother's Monsieur Moreau in the hope that a position can be found for him. Also travelling to L'Isle-Adam is Georges Marest, the second clerk of the count's Parisian notary Crottat; Joseph Bridau, a young artist, who is accompanied by his young colleague L√©on Didas y Lora, nicknamed Mistigris. The final occupant of the coach is P√®re L√©ger, a rich farmer from Val-d'Oise who is leasing the land which the count wishes to buy from Margueron. L√©ger is hoping to buy it himself and then sell it piecemeal at a significant profit to the count. To pass the time Georges amuses himself by pretending to be Colonel Czerni-Georges, a young nobleman with a distinguished military career behind him; his fellow travellers are impressed, but the count sees through him and realizes his true identity. Not to be outdone by Marest, the young painter then passes himself off as the celebrated artist Heinrich Schinner. Things become interesting when Oscar joins in and pretends to be a close acquaintance of the Comte de S√©rizy and his son. In the course of his boasting, he divulges several private and embarrassing details about the count - details which he could only have learnt from his godparents the Moreaus. On the journey the count also overhears a conversation in which L√©ger describes how he and Moreau are conspiring to buy the land the count wants from under his nose and sell it to him at an inflated price. When the count arrives at Presles he wastes little time dismissing Moreau - not so much for conspiring with L√©ger as for revealing personal details about the count and his wife to his godson. Oscar is forced to return to Paris and seek a living by some other means. In time Oscar obtains a license and becomes a clerk in the law office of Desroches in Paris, where he is trained by Godeschal. During this time he renews his acquaintance with Georges Marest, who is actually related to him. For some time Oscar defies everyone's expectations and applies himself diligently to both his studies and his clerkly duties. But Oscar spoils everything by another indiscretion, this one much more serious than the first. At the house of demimondaine Florentine Cabirolle, who was then maintained by Oscar's wealthy uncle Cardot, Oscar gambles away five hundred francs he was given to transact an important legal matter. His hopes ruined for a second time, Oscar is forced to abandon law and enter military service. Once again, he surprises everybody and becomes a successful soldier. He joins the cavalry regiment of the Duc de Maufrigneuse and the Vicomte de S√©rizy, son of the Comte de S√©rizy - the same young nobleman Oscar claimed to be acquainted with in the coach on the road to L'Isle-Adam. The interest of the dauphiness and of Abb√© Gaudron obtain for him promotion and a decoration. He becomes in turn aide-de-camp to La Fayette, captain, officer of the Legion of Honor and lieutenant-colonel. A noteworthy deed made him famous on Algerian territory during the affair of La Macta; Husson lost his left arm rescuing the mortally wounded Vicomte de S√©rizy from the battlefield. Although the vicomte dies shortly afterwards, the Comte de S√©rizy is grateful and forgives Oscar for his earlier indiscretion. Put on half-pay, Oscar obtains the post of collector for Beaumont-sur-Oise. At the end of the novel, Oscar and his mother are taking the Pierrotin coach to L'Isle-Adam, en route to Beaumont-sur-Oise, and find themselves in the company of several witnesses or accomplices of Oscar's earlier indiscretions: Georges Marest has lost by debauchery a fortune worth thirty thousand francs a year, and is now a poor insurance-broker; P√®re L√©ger is now married to the daughter of the new steward of Presles Reybert; Joseph Bridau is now a celebrated artist and married to L√©ger's daughter; Moreau, whose daughter is riding in another part of the same coach, has risen to high political office. When Georges begins to blab about the Moreaus, Oscar - who is now the one travelling incognito - rebukes him, reminding him of the dangers of not holding one's tongue in a public conveyance. Georges recognizes him and renews his acquaintance. In 1838 Oscar becomes engaged to Georgette Pierrotin, daughter of the same Pierrotin who now owns the business that runs the stage- coaches between Paris and Val-d'Oise. At the close of the novel, Balzac draws the following moral: > The adventure of the journey to Presles was a lesson to Oscar Husson in > discretion; his disaster at Florentine's card-party strengthened him in > honesty and uprightness; the hardships of his military career taught him to > understand the social hierarchy and to yield obedience to his lot. Becoming > wise and capable, he was happy. The Comte de S√©rizy, before his death, > obtained for him the collectorship at Pontoise. The influence of Monsieur > Moreau de l'Oise and that of the Comtesse de S√©rizy and the Baron de Canalis > secured, in after years, a receiver-generalship for Monsieur Husson, in whom > the Camusot family now recognize a relation. > Oscar is a commonplace man, gentle, without assumption, modest, and always > keeping, like his government, to a middle course. He excites neither envy > nor contempt. In short, he is the modern bourgeois.

There were proposals for demolishing the building to make space for housing, but the district council rejected them as \\"The former station building makes a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the Woodstock Conservation Area.\\" Approval was given only after the plans included retaining the station building. In 2013 the land behind the station building was built on as a small estate of high specification houses, and the station building was retained with no major changes to the main structure but small changes to the detail.

Barker was the youngest son of Ma Barker, all of whose children were criminals. He was killed in a lengthy gunfight with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 1935. Early life Fred Barker was born to George Elias and Arizona Donnie Clark \\"Ma\\" Barker in Aurora, Missouri on December 12, 1901. The family moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1912. Barker's older brothers Herman, Lloyd and Arthur were committing crimes throughout his childhood, belonging to a gang of local delinquent youths called the Central Park Gang. The gang met in the park to plan crimes and stash their stolen goods. There, Barker met future members of the Barker-Karpis gang, including Volney Davis. He was first arrested and imprisoned in 1927 for burglary. While in prison he met Alvin Karpis. According to Karpis, Barker was a dominant figure in jail who was able to obtain marijuana and other perks. Karpis also said he was a \\"natural born killer\\" who \\"never hesitated\\".Mahoney, Tim Secret Partners, Minnesota Historical Press, 2013, p. 25. Unlike Karpis (nicknamed \\"Creepy Karpis\\"), Barker was known for his personal charm. He was released in 1930. Gang Fred's closest associate Alvin Karpis After their release, Barker and Karpis joined up to commit a string of burglaries in Kansas, often collaborating with other local criminals. Several notable gangsters joined the Barkers in various crimes, including Harvey Bailey, Frank Nash, Fred Goetz, and Dr. Joseph Moran. They were accompanied by Ma Barker and her boyfriend, Arthur Dunlop (sometimes called Dunlap). Things became difficult for the gang when they were confronted by Sheriff C. Roy Kelly in December 1931. Karpis and Barker shot and killed Kelly, an act that forced them to flee the area. The two had also probably killed an Arkansas police chief, Manley Jackson, a month earlier, but had avoided suspicion at the time.Breuer, William B., J. Edgar Hoover and His G-men, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995, p.27. The gang relocated to Minnesota, where, in 1932, Barker, his brother Arthur, Karpis, and Lawrence DeVol robbed Third Northwestern National Bank in Minneapolis. DeVol killed policemen Ira Leon Evans and Leo Gorski during the escape, while Barker murdered Oscar Erickson, a passing motorist.Mahoney, p.63-5 Barker and Karpis were also suspected of killing Dunlop, an alcoholic whom they considered to be untrustworthy after someone tipped police to the gang's hideout. According to other gang members, Dunlop was also abusive to Ma. Around this time Barker started a relationship with Paula Harmon, widow of bank robber Charles Harmon. Karpis did not approve of Paula, considering her to be a \\"drunk\\" and a \\"rotten choice, though you couldn't tell that to Freddie\\".Mahonney, p.59 Kidnappings The gang became nationally notorious in 1933-4, when they organized the kidnappings of local businessmen William Hamm and Edward Bremer. The crimes were orchestrated by racketeers Jack Peifer and Harry Sawyer with inside information about police activity being provided by corrupt officer Tom Brown, who ran the \\"Kidnap Squad\\". Arthur carried out the kidnappings with a different accomplice each time. During the Bremer kidnapping, Barker nearly shot dead the victim when the ransom was not paid promptly. They netted $100,000 for the first victim and twice that for the second. With the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in pursuit, Barker and Karpis attempted to get plastic surgery to alter their appearance and remove their fingerprints. The procedure was carried out by Moran, an underworld doctor. The operations were so painful that Fred asked one of his friends to shoot him to stop the pain, but his friend refused. Moran disappeared shortly thereafter. A badly decomposed body was discovered a year later washed up from Lake Erie on Crystal Beach, Ontario, Canada. Police identified it as Moran. In 1971, Karpis wrote in his autobiography that the identification was mistaken; he claimed that Moran had been murdered by the Barkers and then buried in a lime pit in Michigan.Karpis, A. (1971). Public Enemy Number One: The Alvin Karpis Story. Maclelland & Stewart Pub. The most accepted version of the tale is that Karpis and Fred Barker took Moran on a boat ride on Lake Erie, during which they both murdered him. He was killed either for his botched surgery or for shooting his mouth off about the gang in a brothel.Newton, M. (2002.) The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. Checkmark Books, an imprint of Facts on File, Inc. 0-8160-4489-9Matera, D. (2004). John Dillinger: The Life and Death of America's First Celebrity Criminal, p. 291. Carroll & Graf Publishers. The last time Moran was seen alive was at a brothel in which he drunkenly bragged, \\"I have you guys in the palm of my hand\\". He left the bar with Karpis and Barker and was never seen again. After this the gang attempted to launder the ransom money, though this proved to be difficult because the serial numbers had been recorded by the FBI, a fact that soon became known to the gang. While Harry Sawyer traveled to Cuba to launder the money, his wife Gladys and Fred's girlfriend Paula were arrested for drunk and disorderly behavior at a hotel in Cleveland, Ohio. Paula had a mental breakdown while being questioned and was returned to her family in Texas.Mahonney, p.165 Barker moved to Cuba with his brother, his mother, and Karpis. However, they soon relocated to Florida after Karpis became concerned that the money had not been adequately laundered. They rented a lakeside property in Ocklawaha under the pseudonym \\"Blackburn\\", claiming to be a mother and sons wanting to vacation in a country retreat. Arthur soon left Florida for Chicago. Karpis also moved on, leaving Fred and Ma in the house. FBI agents caught up with them after Arthur was spotted and arrested in Chicago on January 8, 1935. A map found in his possession indicated that other gang members were in Ocklawaha, but did not identify the address. The FBI soon located the house at which they were staying after identifying references to a local alligator named \\"Old Joe\\" and questioning locals about newcomers. Death Fred and Ma Barker died in the upper left bedroom of this house beside Lake Weir in Florida . Agents surrounded the house at 13250 East Highway C-25 on the morning of January 16, 1935. Unknown to the FBI, Karpis and other gang members had left three days before, leaving only Fred and Ma Barker in the house. Ordered to surrender, Fred opened fire. The resulting firefight for about fifteen minutes. The FBI agents retreated to a safe distance, but lobbed smoke bombs into the house. Gunfire continued to come from the house, and Fred and Ma apparently moved from room to room, as shots came from different windows. The FBI returned fire. Allegedly, many local people came to watch the events unfolding, even holding picnics during the gun battle.Stuart B McIver, Touched by the Sun, Pineapple Press, 2008, pp.71ff. Gunfire ceased coming from the house after five hours; the FBI ordered local estate-handyman Willie Woodbury to enter the house wearing a bulletproof vest. Woodbury reported that the occupants were dead. Both bodies were found in the same front bedroom. Fred Barker's body was riddled with bullets, but Ma appeared to have died from a single bullet wound. A Thompson submachine gun was lying between the bodies of Ma and Fred.Jack Powell, Haunting Sunshine, Pineapple Press Inc, 2001, p.54. Their bodies were put on public display, and then stored unclaimed, until October 1, 1935, when relatives had them buried‚Äîat Williams Timberhill Cemetery in Welch, Oklahoma‚Äînext to the body of Herman Barker, who had died in 1927. On January 20, four days after his death, Paula Harmon was committed to the State Hospital for Insane in Rusk, Texas.

Work Cucumbers, c. 1860, Princeton University Art Museum In watercolor and aquatint engravings, Hill employed a stipple technique, building up planes of softly graduated colors made of tiny brushstrokes‚Äìa process commonly seen in painted miniatures. Applied to a larger scale on canvas the result was a form of objective realism in contrast with more common romanticized works of mid-19th century American painting. In 1829, at the age of 17, Hill began exhibiting watercolors and engravings produced in his father's studio at the Brooklyn Art Association and the National Academy of Design. In 1833, at the age of 21, Hill was elected to associate membership in the National Academy of Design. In his early twenties Hill began work for the New York State Geological Survey, first creating a series of topographic studies and overhead views of principle American cities and towns. This work was distinct for its accuracy of aerial perspective and recording minute architectural detail. These portraits of urban settlement required frequent travel to observe, sketch, and map before creating finished watercolor studies. The completed watercolors were then recreated as color lithographic art and published by the Smith Brothers, a New York City publisher. Hill's work with the New York State Geological Survey continued later with his illustration of James Ellsworth De Kay's Zoology of New York State, or; The New-York Fauna. Part II, Birds published in 1844. Like John James Audubon's bird portraits, Hill's were painted with an objective eye, documenting accurate anatomy and colors, and capturing the animal's natural countenance. While in his early forties Hill read John Ruskin's Modern Painters, and became fascinated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. The Pre- Raphaelite movement's combination of realism with increased emotional content appealed to Hill. Hill championed Pre-Raphaelite painting methods in the United States, but was less fascinated with their ideals. In 1863, with art critic Clarence Cook, geologist Clarence King, and architect Russell Sturgis, Hill helped to found the Society for the Advancement of Truth in Art. For the remainder of Hill's life he produced landscapes, mostly of the mountainous areas of New England and New York state. Hill's paintings and engravings are found in the collections of the Brooklyn Museum, the Amon Carter Museum, Fogg Museum, the Hood Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, the Hudson River Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Meet the Parents was not widely distributed and did not earn a large profit at the box office upon its limited release. It did, however, garner some critical acclaim and film industry attention towards remaking the film on a bigger budget. Several years after the film's release, Universal Pictures purchased the rights to the independent film. After hiring screenwriter Jim Herzfeld to expand the script, a new version of Meet the Parents was filmed and released in October 2000.

He mentions his plans to the attendant (Jim Vincent), who advises him against it. He tells the tale of Greg (Greg Glienna) and Pam (Jacqueline Cahill), who were a couple in a similar situation...with a disastrous outcome. Greg sets off a number of incidents that bring shame and disappointment upon his character, leaving Pam's parents (Dick Galloway and Carol Whelan) with an unadmirable and undesirable son-in- law. After breaking the prized Victrola, ruining the roast, renting the only Andy Griffith slasher/porno movie in existence, clogging the toilet, stabbing the mother's eye with a fishing pole, being framed for marijuana possession, wrecking the car, drowning the dog, losing a fight with an ex-boyfriend (Harry Hickstein), and knocking over an urn, Greg has no reputation left to lose. Throughout the visit, Pam's sister Fay (Mary Ruth Clarke), an aspiring singer who can't hold a note, keeps insisting Greg hear her audition, since she mistakenly thinks he has ties with Ed McMahon from Star Search. Greg plans to flee the house with Pam to prevent any more damage, but Fay isn't letting him leave without hearing her sing. Greg's car has conveniently broken down, leaving him no choice but to hear Fay sing. Once the tortuous ballad entitled \\"When Philip's There\\" has ended, Greg is asked to give suggestions. Fearing to start a fuss, he refuses to speak his mind; but Fay's not letting him leave without giving input either. Greg gives slight criticism, leaving her fuming mad. At this point, Pam and her parents have had enough with Greg and force him to leave the house. Greg, surrendered (or perhaps unchained), approaches the front door. Meanwhile, Pam's scream coming from her sister's room upstairs startles the parents. Fay has hanged herself, with a sign reading (in smeared lipstick) \\"Greg killed me\\" around her neck. The father grabs his gun and rushes down the stairs to the foyer. The gas station attendant reveals what happens in the end. The customer seems very uneasy about meeting his fianc√©e's parents now, but once that customer leaves - in walks another one. The next customer (Marc Vann) is on his way to the circus - and the attendant advises him against it, beginning a whole new story.

In her review, she called the film a \\"wonderfully twisted black comedy\\" even though she believed it to be \\"excessive and occasionally overdone.\\" Ayscough predicted that the film \\"could garner a cult following among anti-establishment urbanites\\" due to its \\"blatant attack on marriage, suburban indifference, Christian hypocrisy and the nuclear family\\" and unsuitability for mainstream audiences. Opining that the \\"script desperately needed an objective eye,\\" she concluded by calling the film an \\"amusing vehicle which aptly displays the multiple talents of Greg Glienna.\\" Film producer Elliot Grove, founder of Raindance Film Festival and the British Independent Film Awards, listed the original Meet the Parents on his personal Top Ten list of favorite films. In the article, he called it \\"much funnier and tighter than the Hollywood version.\\" Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum liked the movie and was tempted to call it, \\"the ultimate worst- case-scenario comedy.\\" He said it \\"may not always make you laugh but will impress you with the singularity of Glienna‚Äôs dark approach.\\" And he added the audience was \\"still likely to be taken by the purity and relentlessness of this picture‚Äôs vision.\\" Meet the Parents (2000) and sequels Producer Nancy Tenenbaum acquired the rights to the original film and then she sent a copy to several people of interest hoping to have a new version of the film made. Filmmaker Steven Soderbergh replied that he was interested and that he wanted to direct a remake. He brought it to the attention of Universal Studios who initially declined but subsequently optioned the rights to the film in 1995. Sodebergh took on the project but then dropped it when he got involved with Out of Sight. In 1995 Universal Studios purchased the rights to the film.

Presently, the patient recruitment industry is claimed to total $19 billion per year., 2003 report Patient enrollment is the most time-consuming aspect of the clinical trial process. The leading cause of missed clinical trial deadlines is patient recruitment, taking up to 30 percent of the clinical timeline.Reinventing Patient Recruitment: Revolutionary Ideas for Clinical Trial Success, Joan F. Bachenheimer, Bonnie A. Brescia, Gower Publishing, 2007 Improving patient recruitment rates offers pharmaceutical and medical device companies one of the biggest opportunities to accelerate the pace of clinical trials ‚Äì making it possible to reduce time to market. As the number of patients needed for clinical trials rises ‚Äì as safety and regulatory issues drive trends toward larger and longer trials ‚Äì the demand for patient recruitment services grows. Clinical trials are conducted to collect data regarding the safety and efficacy of new drug and device development. They are conducted in a series of phases, each designed to address a separate purpose: * Phase I: Researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people (20-80) for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects. * Phase II: The study drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people (100-300) to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety. * Phase III: The study drug or treatment is given to large groups of people (1,000-3,000) to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely. * Phase IV: Post marketing studies delineate additional information including the drug's risks, benefits, and optimal use. Pharmaceutical companies submit trial data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of a New Drug Application, the application for FDA approval to market a drug in the U.S. Patient recruitment service providers educate the public about the value of clinical trial participation and the measures in place to protect study participants. The 2001 ‚ÄúWill & Why Survey‚Äù The Will & Why Survey, a Harris Interactive/BBK Healthcare Poll, 2001 of more than 5,000 people in the U.S. showed that 81 percent of the population was not aware of safeguards such as the Declaration of Helsinki, The Belmont Report, Institutional Review Boards, and the informed consent process. However, after learning about these protective measures, nearly 40 percent of respondents reported they would be more likely to participate in a clinical trial.  Origin  The discipline of patient recruitment was formed over three decades ago in the U.S. to meet the challenge of successful on-time enrollment. It has evolved into a field that includes feasibility modeling and analysis; country selection; site selection, training and support; metrics and evaluation; marketing communications, media; and public relations. The patient recruitment sector has experienced rapid growth in recent years, particularly in response to increasing number of global clinical trials. Technology has impacted the evolution of patient recruitment. Many companies have developed proprietary software to help make processes more efficient, and providers increasingly rely on the Internet not only for advertising and early screening, but also for tasks such as tracking data and measuring site performance.  Services   Patient recruitment  The goal of patient recruitment is to raise awareness of clinical trial opportunities and to encourage enrollment. Services are contracted for by pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, medical device companies, contract research organizations (CROs), or a medical research site. Services include: * Study feasibility: Evaluating whether the study may be performed in a given country and how effective it will be in enrolling patients. * Population research: Discovering the motivational drivers of target patient populations is commonly gathered through focus groups, and may involve caregivers and physicians. * Site selection: Choosing the optimal recruiting sites for study participation may play a role in the type of patients that are recruited. For example, in breast cancer survivors, evidence indicates that recruiting via letters or at the oncologist's office results in the recruitment of similar patients. * Site assessment: Investigating the operational, management, technical, and clinical experience capabilities of participating sites helps decide what support they will need to successfully recruit patients for the study, improving forecasting and return on investment. * Recruitment materials: Patient-directed communications designed to attract study referrals and raise enrollment. May include brochures, posters, letters, and flyers. * Media support: Whether directed to patients and/or caregivers, advertising can raise study awareness and drive patient referral volume. Some patient recruitment providers possess in-house capabilities of developing, producing, and editing all content, while others rely on third-party vendors. Some popular media for patient recruitment advertising are: television, radio, newspaper, web (e.g., banner ads and word links), outdoor (e.g., bus stops), and social mediaPharma's Facebook, Newsweek, March 10, 2009Whispering Tweets into a Patient's ear: Top Ten Suggestions for Clinical Trial Recruiters, March 2009 (e.g., Twitter messages and YouTube videos). * Media management: To exact the greatest value from media advertising, media buying services ensure placement in patient-rich geographic areas along with current market buying discounts and opportunities. * Site training materials: Specially-designed instructional tools that assist site staff in introducing the study to patients, explaining study procedures to patients, and performing informed consent procedures with patients. * Study Web site: Serving as an online hub for study information and sometimes pre- screening, the study website usually describes the study, provides disease- related resources, and allows patients to indicate their interest in study participation. * Patient referral follow-up: When a site may be short of staff or overwhelmed by a spike in patient referrals, a PRO may offer administrative support by scheduling site appointments and following up with patients who may present enrollment challenges (e.g., a patient who recently moved and needs a closer site location). * Translations: Providing cultural and regulatory- compliant translation of recruitment materials into various languages in accordance with country-specific requirements. * Community outreach: To expand study awareness, outreach efforts may include participation at local health fairs or networking among community service groups, patient support groups, and other neighborhood organizations and institutions (e.g., churches and barbershops). * Physician outreach: When study recruitment depends in large part on physician referrals, outreach measures can include forums where doctors, specialists, and healthcare providers gather to view a presentation on the study and how their patient pool may be eligible for participation. It may also include direct mail programs where collateral is sent to physicians with the aim of increasing referral volume. * Site support: From resolving pre-trial operational issues to tailored support (e.g., referral processing, subject status updates, and protocol clarifications), site support ensures study challenges are immediately addressed. * Monitoring and reporting: To assess the effects of the patient recruitment activities on enrollment, ongoing monitoring is performed. Assessing study metrics allows the sponsor to adjust recruitment efforts as needed to ensure maximum return on investment.  Patient retention  If a trial is lengthy or if it requires invasive procedures, the greater the need for retention support to help keep patients involved for the entire trial timeline. For those engaged in global clinical studies, particularly lengthy trials with extension studies, the need for patient retention services is significant. A variety of support services that are considered retention specific include: * Visit reminders: To stem the possibility of missed appointments, visit alerts ensure compliance as they contribute to keeping the study top-of-mind. Reminders may take the form of post cards, e-mails, text messages, or phone calls. * Patient support items: With particularly lengthy studies or where many invasive or extensive study procedures are involved, patient recognition items reflect appreciation for study participation and encourage retention (e.g., where lengthy infusions are repeatedly required in a study, a pillow or blanket may be given to a patient to prevent discomfort). * Caregiver support: In some studies, the caregiver plays an integral role in ongoing patient participation, as in many Alzheimer's disease research trials. Recognizing the needs of the caregiver (e.g., study guides, modest food cards to compensate for lunchtime visits, coping skill resources, and home nurse visits) contributes to patient retention.  Current Process  E6-GCP guidelines suggest that an investigator should have adequate resources to demonstrate (e.g., based on retrospective data) a potential for recruiting the required number of suitable subjects within the agreed recruitment period. There are many different recruitment methods, including media (i.e., television, radio and newspaper), physician referrals, press releases, fliers, random mailings, cold calls and the internet. These methods must be selected before study start. Also, some common factors such as-sample size, suitability of the strategy as per study design and overall budgetary constraints must not be ignored.http://www.hcltech.com/sites/default/files/patient_recruitment_and_retention_strategy_in_clinical_trials.pdf  References  Category:Advertising Category:Clinical trials Category:Pharmaceutical industry Category:Recruitment ","title":"Patient recruitment"},{"id":"24055677","text":"Johann Christian Dieterich (1722The Allgemeinen Deutschen Biographie gives 1712, but this contradicts church records.-1800) was the founder of the Dieterich‚Äôschen Verlagsbuchhandlung publishing house and a close friend of Georg Christoph Lichtenberg.

That refusal is generally referred to as \\"nullification\\" but has also been expressed as \\"interposition:\\" the states' right to \\"interpose\\" between the federal government and the people of the state. The Principles of '98 were widely promoted in Jeffersonian democracy, especially by the Quids, such as John Randolph of Roanoke, but never became law. Etymology The term derives from the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions written in 1798 by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, respectively. They led a vocal segment of the Founding Fathers that believed that if the federal government, if it is the exclusive judge of its limitations under the US Constitution, would eventually overcome those limits and become more and more powerful and authoritarian. It argued that despite formal limiting devices, such as elections and separation of power, would not suffice the government could judge its own case regarding constitutionality. As Jefferson wrote, \\"When all government, domestic and foreign, in little as in great things, shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another, and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated.\\" History In contrast to thay position, other Founding Fathers believed that it is the responsibility of the federal judiciary, not of the states, to determine whether Congress acts consistently with the Constitution. In Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton stated that the federal courts are the natural and proper forum for determining such legal issues: \\"The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute, the intention of the people to the intention of their agents.\\" In Federalist No. 80, Hamilton rejected the idea that each state may apply its own interpretation of the Constitution: \\"The mere necessity of uniformity in the interpretation of the national laws, decides the question. Thirteen independent courts of final jurisdiction over the same causes, arising upon the same laws, is a hydra in government, from which nothing but contradiction and confusion can proceed.\\" The Principles of '98 were not adopted by any other state. Seven state legislatures formally rejected the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, and three others expressed disapproval. Several of the states asserted that the federal judiciary, not the states, is the proper forum to interpret the Constitution. In 1803, Marbury v. Madison was a case decided by the US Supreme Court] that has ever since established the principle of judicial review that has been the overriding legal precedent in constitutional law. Nevertheless, versions of the Principles of '98 continued to be promoted by some parties during the early 19th century. Besides the original reaction to the Alien and Sedition Acts, the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions, nullification was discussed and cited by state courts and legislatures in New England in reaction to the Embargo of 1807 and the War of 1812: Similarly, the Massachusetts General Court approved a committee report that stated: \\"Whenever the national compact is violated, and the citizens of this State are oppressed by cruel and unauthorized laws, this Legislature is bound to interpose its power, and wrest from the oppressor its victim.\\" South Carolina's opposition to the Tariff of Abominations was also based on the principles of '98, which led to the Nullification Crisis. Another prominent use of the principles was in opposing the federal government's Fugitive Slave Laws, which forced people to aid and abet slavery, particularly the return of runaway slaves: Part of that Wisconsin ruling was taken word for word from the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798. The US Supreme Court, however, overruled the Wisconsin Supreme Court in Ableman v. Booth (1859). After the American Civil War, the Jeffersonians, who favored decentralized democracy and states' rights, permanently lost favor, and the Principles of '98 were largely forgotten. The US Supreme Court has remained both de facto and de jure the final arbiter of constitutionality in the United States. Jefferson's biographer Dumas Malone argued that the Kentucky Resolution might have gotten Jefferson impeached for treason if his actions had become known at the time.Chernow, Ron. \\"Alexander Hamilton\\". 2004. p586. Penguin Press. In writing the Kentucky Resolutions, Jefferson warned that \\"unless arrested at the threshold,\\" the Alien and Sedition Acts would \\"necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood.\\" The historian Ron Chernow stated that Jefferson \\"wasn't calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience: he was calling for outright rebellion, if needed, against the federal government of which he was vice president.\\" Jefferson \\"thus set forth a radical doctrine of states' rights that effectively undermined the constitution.\\"Chernow, Ron. \\"Alexander Hamilton\\". 2004. p587. Penguin Press. Chernow argued that neither Jefferson nor Madison sensed that they had sponsored measures as inimical as the Alien and Sedition Acts themselves. The historian Garry Wills argued, \\"Their nullification effort, if others had picked it up, would have been a greater threat to freedom than the misguided [alien and sedition] laws, which were soon rendered feckless by ridicule and electoral pressure.\\"Wills, Gary. \\"James Madison\\". p49 The theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions was \\"deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion.\\" George Washington was so appalled by the resolutions that he told Patrick Henry that if \\"systematically and pertinaciously pursued,\\" they would \\"dissolve the union or produce coercion.. The influence of the Jeffersonian doctrine of states' rights, however, reverberated right up to the Civil War.Knott. \\"Alexander Hamilton and the Persistence of Myth.\\" p48 The future President James Garfield, at the close of the Civil War, said that the Kentucky Resolution \\"contained the germ of nullification and secession, and we are today reaping the fruits.\\" References Further reading * Gutzman, Kevin R. \\"A troublesome legacy: James Madison and \`The principles of '98',\\" Journal of the Early Republic, Winter 1995, Vol. 15 Issue 4, pp 569‚Äì90 Category:Classical liberalism Category:Libertarianism in the United States Category:Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions Category:Thomas Jefferson Category:United States constitutional law Category:Legal history of the United States ","title":"Principles of '98"},{"id":"24055794","text":"Giuseppe Cesare Gaetano Molla (1845 ‚Äì 1894) was an Italian impresario, conductor, pianist, and opera director.

This person is known to the general public because since 1870 the Chief Cashier's signature is printed on all bank notes issued by the Bank of England. In 2004 a new post was created, Executive Director of Banking & Chief Cashier, incorporating the title. The post is currently held by Sarah John who was appointed in June 2018. She is the 33rd Chief Cashier since the Bank was founded in 1694.  Responsibilities  The position has the following responsibilities: * The security and effective operation of real-time gross settlement in the UK‚Äôs high value payment systems (CHAPS and CREST). * Along with the Bank‚Äôs Sterling Markets Division they are also responsible for the provision of liquidity to the market and settlement banks. * The issuing and effective distribution of banknotes and their security against counterfeiting. * The provision of banking services, focusing on high-value government banking. The Executive Director Banking & Chief Cashier is a member of the Governor‚Äôs Executive Team which is the Bank‚Äôs senior management group.  History  In 1694 the Bank of England was established. Almost immediately, the Bank started to issue notes in return for deposits. The crucial feature that made Bank of England notes a means of exchange was the promise to pay the bearer the sum of the note on demand. This meant that the note could be redeemed at the Bank for gold or coinage by anyone presenting it for payment; if it was not redeemed in full, it was endorsed with the amount withdrawn. These notes were initially handwritten on Bank paper and signed by one of the Bank‚Äôs cashiers. During the 18th century there was a gradual move towards fixed denomination notes. In 1725 the Bank started issuing partly printed notes for completion in manuscript. The ¬£ sign and the first digit were printed but the cashier‚Äôs signature along with the name of the payee and other numerals were added by hand. The first fully printed notes appeared in 1855 relieving the cashiers of the task of filling in the name of the payee and signing each note individually. The practice of writing the name of the Chief Cashier as the payee on notes was halted in favour of the anonymous ‚ÄúI promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of ‚Ä¶‚Äù, a feature that has remained unchanged on notes to this day. The printed signature on the note continued to be that of one of three cashiers until 1870; since then it has always been that of the Chief Cashier. The Bank of England notes on its website that the promise holds \\"for all time\\", even after notes have been withdrawn from circulation. This means that every Bank of England note can be exchanged for its face value at any time.

Career Holden started out with Liverpool youth, aged 6 but was released by the club at the age of 12. He joined Everton's youth teams for eighteen months before moving to Tranmere Rovers as a trainee. Whilst at Tranmere he scored both the late goals that put Bury out of the FA Youth Cup in 2006. After being released in 2007, Holden signed for Welsh Premier League side The New Saints for the 2007‚Äì08 season, making 22 league starts scoring six goals as the team finished in second place. He left The New Saints at the end of the season, following manager Ken McKenna to Northern Premier League Premier Division side Cammell Laird. A short spell at Bradford Park Avenue came before joining Rhyl in January 2009. He had an unfortunate time with injuries but still scored four goals in nine league starts and later played in both legs of Rhyl's Champions League qualifying matches against FK Partizan in July 2009. A move to Football League Championship side Coventry City broke down after Holden was unable to agree personal terms and, on 1 September 2009, Holden instead signed for League One team Charlton Athletic on a three-month loan deal. He made just one appearance for Charlton, during a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Southampton in the Football League Trophy, before returning to Rhyl in January 2010. Having been recommended to the club by former player Neil Roberts, Holden joined Conference National side Wrexham on trial before signing on a 93-day emergency loan deal with the club on 1 February 2010, making his debut the following day in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Mansfield Town. However, at the end of the season, Holden was not offered a permanent deal with the club. In July 2010, Holden joined Conference North side Droylsden., and stayed until transferring to Chester in November 2011 where he earned Man of the Match on his first start. In January 2012 he rejoined one of his former teams, The New Saints, on non-contract terms. He made one Welsh Premier League appearance for the club against Neath, before a few days later being released by the club. His next move was to Formby where he played just two games before moving in late March to Gainsborough Trinity. Holden was not amongst those players retained at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season and thus left the club. After trials for Rochdale in the summer of 2012 he rejoined Formby early in the 2012/13 season. He then joined Warrington Town in September, making his debut on 29 September against Clitheroe. Within the first month at the club, he was sent- off twice in three games. His only goal for the club came on 20 October when he scored a penalty in a 7‚Äì2 victory over Goole.
