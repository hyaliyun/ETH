In contemporary letters and documents Alexander is known by variant spellings of \\"Brunstane,\\" his territorial designation. The original House of Brunstane was near Penicuik, and another Crichton estate at Gilberstoun near Portobello, Edinburgh later became known as Brunstane.John Geddie, The Fringes of Edinburgh (1926), p. 152. Career Affair of the Cardinal's letters Alexander Crichton went to France carrying royal letters in 1539 and as a servant of Cardinal Beaton.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol.7 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 275. On his return in February 1540 his ship was forced by a storm to anchor in an English harbour. Subsequently, the English ambassador in Scotland Ralph Sadler tried to embarrass and discredit Cardinal Beaton in front of James V of Scotland with compromising letters captured from Brunstane's bag. James V however argued in favour of the Cardinal that he had a separate spiritual authority in Scotland apart from the King's own temporal powers. Later, when the Cardinal was present, James and Ralph compared the captured letters with Beaton's copies, and found a discrepancy. James V thanked Sadler and his uncle Henry VIII but would not find fault in the Cardinal's actions.Arthur Clifford, Sadler State Papers, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1809), pp. 25-28, 42-44. Messages to France Alexander Crichton remained in the Cardinal's favour and sailed with him to France in 1540. He returned before his master in 1541 to meet James V. The King, Crichton, and the secretary, Thomas Erskine of Haltoun, played tennis at St Andrews on 3 April 1541.Athol Murray, 'Pursemaster's Accounts', in 10th Miscellany of Scottish History Society (SHS, Edinburgh, 1965), pp. 35 footnote, 41. In November 1542 he sailed to France from Dumbarton on the business of rents owed to the Cardinal and Mary of Guise. He returned with money for James V from Francis I of France and was later accused of keeping some of it. An English spy said of Alexander's return in December 1542 that he had brought \\"little comfort.\\"Robet Kerr Hannay, Rentale Sanctee Andree (SHS, Edinburgh, 1913), pp. xxxix-xl, 131: Letters & Papers, Henry VIII, vol. 17, nos. 1100 (2), 1193. On 19 November 1542 he and his son John were rewarded for Alexander's services and expenses in France with a new charter for part of their Gilberstoun estate.Register of the Great Seal, 1513-1546 (Edinburgh, 1883), no. 2839. War of the Rough Wooing Assured Scot After the death of James V in December 1542, Scotland was ruled by a Governor, Regent Arran. By now Alexander Crichton of Brunstane was receiving an English pension as a supporter of English political and Protestant religious policy in Scotland. In July 1543 Cardinal Beaton and his allies who opposed Regent Arran and pro-English iniatives camped with up to 6,000 armed men at Linlithgow, where Mary, Queen of Scots was kept in the Linlithgow Palace. Alexander Crichton told Ralph Sadler that the principal cause of this rebellion was to break the peace with England, the recently signed Treaty of Greenwich. This peace agreement provided that Mary, Queen of Scots would marry the English Prince Edward when she was of age. In his report to England, Sadler contrasted Crichton's and George Douglas's account of the situation with the statement of the Earl of Glencairn, that the rebel party were happy with the marriage plan and only concerned with the detail of when Mary would be sent to England.Joseph Bain, Hamilton Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1890), pp. 590-1. The Governor and the Cardinal were reconciled. Crichton continued to correspond with Ralph Sadler. In November 1543, when Sadler had been forced to move from Edinburgh to Tantallon Castle and the English marriage plan was losing support in Scotland, Brunstane wrote that he was continuing to recruit supporters for English policy, and mentions John Charteris and John Sandilands of Calder. He persuaded Sandilands's neighbours to refuse offers of French payments.Letters & Papers, Henry VIII, vol. 18 part 2 (London, 1902), nos. 425, 427, 428, 443, 434. Plots against the Cardinal At the opening of the war of the Rough Wooing in March 1544, Brunstane met the English Berwick Pursuivant, Henry Ray secretly in Edinburgh and gave him letters he had written for Henry VIII.Letters and Papers Henry VIII, vol.19, no. 228. In April 1544, he proposed the murder of Cardinal Beaton, while Lord Hertford was planning the invasion that resulted in the burning of Edinburgh in May. The offer was not taken up, but Brunstane was given a cipher code to use in his English letters. Brunstane employed a Scot called Wishart to take his plan for the Cardinal to Lord Hertford on 17 April 1544, who noted for Henry VIII its two objectives;Alexander Crichton of Brunstane offered to raise Scottish troops and destroy Arbroath for Henry VIII > One is, that the Larde of Grange, late Tresourer of Scotlande, the Master of > Rothes, th'earl of Rothers eldest son, and John Charters, wolde attempte > eyther to apprehende or slee the Cardynall at some tyme when he shall passe > thorough the Fyf lande, ..., > The other is, that in case Your Majestie would grant unto them a convenyent > enterteynnment for to kepe 1,000 or 1,500 men in wages for a moneth or two, > ..., they will take uppon them, at such tyme as Your Majesties armye shalbe > in Scotland, to destroye the abbey and town of Arbroath ..., and > t'apprehende all those whiche they say be the principall impugnators of > amyte bitwen Englande and Scotlande\\" > > One is, that the laird of Grange, lately Treasurer of Scotland, the Master > of Rothes, the earl of Rothes's eldest son, and John Charteris, would > attempt either to apprehend or slay the Cardinal at some time when he shall > through Fife land. > The other is, that in case Your Majesty would grant them a convenient > entertainment (finance) for 1,000 or 1,500 men in wages, they will undertake > at such time as Your Majesties army shall be in Scotland, to destroy the > Abbey and town of Arbroath, and apprehend all those which they say be the > principal opponents of the amity between England and ScotlandState Papers > Henry VIII, vol.5 part 2 continued (London, 1836), p. 377, Hertford to Henry > VIII. The historian Charles Rogers discussed the identity of Brunstane's messenger \\"Wishart.\\" Rogers argued that the priest and master of arts and Protestant preacher George Wishart would not simply be called \\"Wishart\\" in this correspondence, and suggested the messenger was a young man, John, eldest son of John Wishart of Carnbeg.Rogers, Charles (1876), pp. 311-4 According to the report of Eustace Chapuys, Brunstane tried to speak to Lord Hertford at Leith on 5 May 1544 during his invasion of Edinburgh. One of Hertford's guards shot him in the leg with an arrow. He returned next day with papers of safe- conduct, saying he had offers from Scottish lords, but Hertford, who had orders not to negotiate with any Scot, would not see him.Calendar State Papers Spain, vol.7 (London, 1899), no. 95, (Chapuys's reference shows that Crichton was already known to the Empire.) Hertford wrote that Crichton was in the field with Arran's forces and retreated with them to Linlithgow. Before the 15 May, Crichton had got a message Hertford mentioning that he planned to come to London as he could no longer abide in Scotland.Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol. 19, (London, 1903), nos. 472, 510. He went to London in June 1544, carrying a letter to Henry VIII from George Douglas of Pittendreich.Fraser, William, ed., Douglas Book, vol.4, (Edinburgh, 1885) p. 365. Brunstane went back to London on Arran's business in November 1544 to discuss compensation for captured shipping.Rogers, Charles (1876), p.285, quoting reference subsequently printed in Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 8 (Edinburgh, 1908), p. 234. Brunstane repeated his offer to capture or kill the Cardinal in July 1545. Henry VIII would not directly sponsor the murder but Ralph Sadler wrote to Brunstane with the encouragement that it would be \\"an acceptable service to God to take him away.\\" Sadler promised Henry VIII would reward the killers. He also suggested that George Douglas of Pittendreich and the Earl of Cassilis should become involved in Brunstane's plot, although nothing was done at this time.Letters & Papers, Henry VIII, vol.20 part 1, (London, 1905), nos. 1177, 1178: State Papers Henry VIII, vol.5 (London, 1836), p.440 footnote (mentions Brunstane's cipher) International angles The Governor of the Netherlands, Mary of Hungary believed that France insincerely encouraged the English marriage plan in order to gain an advantage in negotiations with England about Boulogne which had been captured on 13 September 1544.CSP Spain, vol.9 (1912), p.41. There was a third scheme. Brunstane wrote to Sadler on 20 October 1545 requesting an urgent meeting at Berwick upon Tweed. George Douglas of Pittendreich had told him that the Lords of the Parliament of Scotland had signed an agreement for Mary, Queen of Scots to marry James Hamilton, the son of the Governor.Letters & Papers, Henry VIII, vol.20 part 2, (1907), no.622. James Hamilton, the \\"Master of Hamilton,\\" had been kept by the Cardinal at St Andrews Castle since October 1544.Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland, vol.8, p.319 Alexander had heard that the Cardinal was trying to have the queen brought to St Andrews, but he was sceptical that the Cardinal really wanted the Hamilton marriage to proceed, and thought that Mary of Guise was pretending to be angry about the plan.State Papers Henry VIII, vol.5 (London, 1836), p. 549, 6 Oct. 1545. Sadler returned to London and the revelation of his wife's bigamy, and there is no record of a meeting with Brunstane at Berwick. The diplomat Johannes Sturm wrote to the English secretary of state, William Paget on 4 December with news of discussions of the new marriage plan in France. Sturmius realised that the Hamilton marriage would disrupt the Anglo-French peace treaty negotiations and advised Paget they should hinder it.Letters & Papers, Henry VIII, vol. 20 part 2 (London, 1907), no. 697, 927. Wishart's arrest Alexander Crichton of Brunstane was with the preacher George Wishart when Arran's men came to arrest him. In 1546 the preacher George Wishart stayed at the House of Brunstane. The Earl of Bothwell arrested Wishart at the house of Brunstane's friend, John Cockburn of Ormiston on 16 January 1546. Later that night Arran's men came for Ormiston, Brunstane and young Sandilands of Calder. Alexander escaped, running in the frost through Ormiston wood and on to Tantallon Castle.David Laing, Works of John Knox, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1846), pp. 140-2. George Wishart was taken to St Andrews and executed. On 16 May 1546 a summons of treason was issued on Alexander.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 8 (Edinburgh, 1908), p. 458. The Cardinal was murdered at St Andrews Castle by a group of Protestant lairds from Fife which included the men Alexander had put forward. These lairds, who became known as the Castilians, garrisoned the castle and held the Governor's son, James Hamilton hostage. The Scottish ratification of the Treaty of Ardres The long-awaited Anglo-French Treaty of Ardres (or Campe) was concluded on 7 June 1546, and required a ratification from Scotland to be finalised.Marcus Merriman, The Rough Wooings (Tuckwell, East Linton, 2000), pp. 195-201. Although the Scottish Parliament had continued to summon Alexander Crichton for treason, the action was abandoned for unspecified reasons on 4 August.see Records of Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, website by St Andrews University: Thomson, Thomas, ed., Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, vol.2 (Edinburgh, 1814), p. 469. The Scottish Parliament approved the ratification of the Treaty of Ardres on 14 August 1546. As the factional rivalry between the Governor and Mary of Guise continued, there was controversy over who should carry Scotland's ratification to London. Adam Otterburn wrote to Mary of Guise with news that Lord Ruthven, the secretary David Paniter, and Arran's half-brother, the Abbot of Paisley accompanied by Alexander Crichton of Brunstane had set out, but they were recalled after a change of plan.Thomson, Thomas, ed., Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, vol.2 (Edinburgh, 1814), pp. 473-4: Cameron, Annie I., ed., Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (SHS, Edinburgh, 1927), pp. 169-173. The Spanish Empire pressed for the ratification, as Scottish captains were able to harass Flemish shipping without redress. Finally, Henry's Welsh diplomat Edward Carne was able to show the Scottish ratification to Mary of Hungary's administrator in Brussels, the President Lodewijk van Schore on 10 September. Schore pointed out its shortcomings and noted that Arran laid siege to St Andrews Castle. Mary of Hungary understood that the Empire remained at war with Scotland despite the treaty. She believed Arran's government delayed the resolution of peace with the empire because the situation prevented Henry sending military aid to the Protestants in St Andrews Castle.Letters and Papers, Henry VIII, vol. 21 part 2 (London, 1910), no. 75, 92. Brunstane declares for England Brunstane Castle near Penicuik The English Privy Council authorised payments to Brunstane in 1546, one in April for three months wages for a band of 100 horsemen, and in October granted his servant Cockburn a passport to carry satin cloth over the border for his furniture. The English border warden William Eure had already given him money.Dasent, J. R., Acts of Privy Council of England, 1542-1547, London (1890), 395, 487, 546 After the battle of Pinkie on 10 September 1547, Brunstane travelled with the English Norroy Herald, Gilbert Dethick, carrying messages between the Privy Council of Scotland and Mary of Guise at Stirling Castle and Lord Hertford.An English Garner: Tudor Tracts (London, 1903), pp.139, 142, re-printing Patten, W., The Late Expedition in Scotland (London, 1548) The English commander Grey of Wilton occupied Haddington, and garrisoned nearby lairds's houses in East Lothian. Alexander and John Cockburn held the Houses of Ormiston, Saltoun, and Brunstane for England. Earl of Bothwell's castle at Hailes Alexander and Ormiston waited for their opportunity to capture Edinburgh Castle and deliver to the English the Governor of Scotland Regent Arran and his half-brother John Hamilton, who had displaced Alexander's kinsman Robert Crichton as Bishop of Dunkeld. They also wanted Grey of Wilton to capture and garrison the Earl of Bothwell's house at Hailes Castle.CSP Scotland, vol.1 (1898), p.57, 59. They wrote jointly to John Luttrell, the English commander of Broughty Castle on 17 January 1548 asking him to allow fishermen from Crail to supply them.Annie I. Cameron, Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (SHS, Edinburgh, 1927), pp. 211-213. \\"Yon new blockhouse\\" Regent Arran brought four cannon from Edinburgh Castle at the end of February and captured the houses of the three Lothian lairds. The lairds of Brunstane and Ormiston were declared traitors and the Scottish Privy Council ordered the demolition of Brunstane, Gilberstoun, and Ormiston.HMC 11th Report, part VI, Manuscripts of the Duke of Hamilton (London 1887), p. 39: Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooings (Tuckwell, East Lothian, 2000), pp. 154, 209, 305-6. In March 1548, slaters were employed to take the roof off Brunstane House, and the roof timbers were dismantled and taken to Edinburgh. The woods were harvested and the workmen were protected by 10 gunners armed with culverins. The timber and stone from the house was used in the construction of the new Spur fortification at Edinburgh Castle designed by Migliorino Ubaldini, which Ormiston's brother, Ninian Cockburn, called \\"yon neu blok hous.\\" Goods were also seized from Alexander's house at Penicuik.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1911), pp. xxviii, 161-2, 163, 166, 167, 172-3: CSP Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 93 no. 220. On 6 April, Grey of Wilton reported that Alexander's house had not been burnt, but; > \\"Marry! the topp is pulled downe, so much of the stone as was lyked, which > laye in redyness to bylde, caryed to Edynborough, his yong trees cut up, and > all worse handled than if it had been with fyer.\\"CSP Scotland, vol.1 > (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 108 no. 220. Alexander stayed at Nunraw, he, Ormiston and their ally, Hugh Douglas of Longniddry, remained in Lothian with a force of 150 English horsemen. Grey of Wilton told Brunstane and Ormiston that he hoped to capture George Douglas, and they kept his secret.CSP Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p.93 no. 190, p.111 no. 227, p. 118 no. 240, p.119 no. 241. Following Grey of Wilton's recommendation, Edward VI gave the two lairds compensation for their losses caused by military action and supplying Haddington which was held by the English.Dasent, J. R., ed., Acts of the Privy Council of England, 1547-1552, vol. 2 (London, 1890), pp. 178-9: CSP Scotland, vol.1 (edinburgh, 1898), p. 118 no. 140. Heir restored Alexander was forfeited as a traitor by the Parliament of Scotland on 14 December 1548, for his crimes in January of assisting Grey of Wilton, keeping the House of Saltoun, and persuading lieges of Scotland to form leagues against Mary, Queen of Scots. After his death, the date of which has not been established,Rogers, Charles (1876), 285 on 5 December 1558, the forfeiture was reversed in favour of his heir, John Crichton, on the grounds that the procedure was flawed because Alexander was out of the country at the time. The sentence against John Cockburn of Ormiston was withdrawn in the same terms on the same day.National Archives of Scotland, PA2/10, f.38r-41v., digitised by Records of the Parliaments of Scotland: St Andrews University John Crichton was an active supporter of the Lords of the Congregation during the Scottish Reformation. Like his father before him, he was called the \\"Laird of Brymston\\" (Brunstane) in English letters. On 23 January 1560 he rode into Scotland to Glasgow at night bringing letters from the English court to the Protestants and was sent to Fife to summon the lords to come for the negotiation of the treaty of Berwick.Sadler State Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1809), p. 693, 699-700. John Crichton rebuilt Brunstane Castle at Penicuik in 1568 and the date was carved over the entrance.McGibbon & Ross, Castellated & Domestic Architecture, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1892), pp. 170-3.

Important Bird Area The western coastline of the island, including the cliffs, has been identified as a 360 ha Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it is home to one of the largest colonies of Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses in the world, with about 19,000 pairs constituting some 20% of the world population, and about 240 pairs of sooty albatrosses. There is also a large colony of northern rockhopper penguins, with 25,000 pairs. Two species, grey and soft-plumaged petrels, which have become rare on the island due to predation by rats and cats, are thought to breed in the IBA. There is a large rookery of subantarctic fur seals in the IBA. Ten endemic arthropods have been recorded. The vegetation, which includes three endemic plant species, is dominated by tussock-grasses and rushes which are densest towards the foot of the cliffs.

The main card featured five MMA bouts which were shown on PPV, as well as seven preliminary bouts which were shown on FX, and Facebook. This was the first time in UFC history that the main card featured all heavyweight bouts. It was the twelfth UFC event of 2012. The main event featured the UFC Heavyweight Champion, Junior dos Santos, defending his title against former two-time UFC Heavyweight Champion Frank Mir. The contest was heavily promoted, featuring the return of UFC Primetime to promote the UFC Heavyweight Championship. The co-main event of the evening was a battle between former heavyweight champion Cain Velasquez, and newly acquired Strikeforce heavyweight, Antônio Silva, who made his UFC debut. Background Frank Mir was riding a three fight win streak leading up to this event, including a submission victory over Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira, a friend and mentor of Junior dos Santos, at UFC 140. Nogueira refused to tap to the kimura lock submission attempt, until it broke after his arm snapped under the pressure, then he tapped. Not only was Mir the first fighter to ever submit Nogueira, but he did so in devastating fashion. This was the first title defense for dos Santos since winning the belt by knocking out Cain Velasquez in November 2011 at UFC on Fox: Velasquez vs. Dos Santos. UFC Primetime returned to promote the UFC Heavyweight Championship between Mir and dos Santos. The heavyweight championship at UFC 146 was the featured fight on the main card, which for the first time in UFC history had all heavyweight bouts. Evan Dunham was expected to face Edson Barboza at the event. However, Dunham was forced from the event with an injury and replaced by returning veteran Jamie Varner. Mark Hunt was originally scheduled to face Stefan Struve on the main card. However, on May 17, 2012, Hunt withdrew from the bout due to injury and was replaced by Lavar Johnson. Alistair Overeem removal and card changes Originally scheduled to headline the event was a Heavyweight Championship bout between one of UFC's newest stars, Alistair Overeem (who defeated former champion Brock Lesnar in his UFC debut to earn the title shot), and champion Junior dos Santos. On April 4, 2012, however, the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) announced Overeem had failed his pre-fight drug test. Overeem's March drug test showed a 14:1 testosterone- epitestosterone ratio, according to the NSAC. This resulted in a considerable shake up of the matches on the main card. On April 20, 2012, UFC President Dana White announced that Junior dos Santos would now defend his title against Frank Mir instead. Two days later, White announced Cain Velasquez (who was originally slated to fight Mir in the co-main event) would face Antônio Silva. Roy Nelson (who was originally scheduled to fight Silva, and then briefly Gabriel Gonzaga) faced Dave Herman. And Shane del Rosario (who was originally slated to fight Gonzaga) faced Stipe Miocic.

The site, which is extremely good from a strategic perspective, shows the ideal type of ground plan of a hill castle from the High Middle Ages. The builder of the most important fortifications of the Welf dynasty was Duke Henry the Lion. The castle was built to counter the Bishopric of Hildesheim and its Hohenstaufen neighbour in Goslar. In spite of numerous conflicts of those times, it was not destroyed until 1552 by the cannons of a mercenary army.  Layout of the castle  The castle comprises an upper and lower wards. The upper ward lies on an oval plateau, 45 metres × 80 metres in area. Here there are various residential and domestic buildings, towers and the castle well, surrounded by a enceinte. In a residential building measuring 10 metres × 8.5 metres is a ladies' apartment (Kemenate) an old hot air heating system was uncovered during excavations. A little below the inner ward there is a 32-metre × 8-metre palas, with its great hall, as well as a neighbouring tower and dungeon. The first construction phase of the castle is dated to the 12th century, and its expansion was probably carried out between 1170 and 1180. The large outer ward belongs to a more recent building phase. It was surrounded by a rampart and moat system as well as an enceinte with 13 demi-bastions. Of these, parts of the gate wall and the associated moat have survived. The only traces of former buildings are their individual foundation fragments.

The Welf duke, Henry the Lion (1129–1195) used it as a bulwark against the Hohenstaufen emperor, Frederick Barbarossa. The castle lay on the border of the Welf principality and threatened the neighbouring, non-Welf territories of the Bishopric of Hildesheim as the imperial estate of Goslar. In the course of his imperial expedition against Henry the Lion, Frederick Barbarossa captured the castle in 1180 after a short siege. The \\"Lion\\" did not get it back until after the peace treaty with the Hohenstaufen emperor, Henry VI in 1194. A year later, Henry the Lion, lord of the castle, died. In 1198, the Hohenstaufen fraction in the empire elected Philip of Swabia as king, whereupon the Welf party choose Otto IV (the 16-year-old son of Henry the Lion) as antiking. Otto IV took advantage of the power base of Lichtenberg Castle in order to inflict damage on the imperial town of Goslar that was loyal to the Hohenstaufens. In order to safeguard the imperial estate of Goslar, in 1206 the Hohenstaufens had their imperial advocate (Reichsvogt) from Goslar, Count Hermann of Wöltingerode, advance against the castle which, rather surprisingly he managed to conquer. In early June 1206 Count Gunzelin of Wolfenbüttel unsuccessfully besieged Lichtenberg Castle, after Count Hermann had captured it and from there he conducted raids and forays in the surrounding region as well as in the area of Peine, Gunzelin's county. When Otto IV became recognised as the only king in 1208 (after the murder of his adversary), the castle fell back into Welf hands. In 1218 he died and the castle was inherited by Duke Otto of Brunswick and Lüneburg, the Child. After his death, his son, Duke John of Brunswick and Lüneburg, inherited the estates and lordship of Lichtenberg. Periodically the castle was enfeoffed to the town of Brunswick, but in 1365 it was redeemed again by the lords of Saldern. They operated from the castle as robber knights; their raids being reported in the Brunswick book of fees in 1379-82. The noble von Saldern family was driven from the castle in the 15th century. In the records of that period Rudolf von Garßenbüttel and Herwig von Uetze are named as advocates (Vögte). Destruction In 1552 units under Count Vollrad of Mansfeld of the Schmalkaldic League advanced on the castle. He had invaded the Duchy of Brunswick with around 5,400 landsknechts and 2,100 horsemen and had already devastated towns in the Harz Foreland. The troops fired on the castle with heavy cannon, including large calibre Fürmösers (mortars). Since then Lichtenberg Castle has lain in ruins, its use as a quarry to build the state farm (Staatsdomäne) of Lichtenberg only added to its demise. In the same year Mansfeld appeared in like manner before Neuhaus Castle in Wolfsburg. Rebuilding The new bergfried built around 1900 In the 19th century the castle ruins attracted public interest. The Bismarck era was responsible for an increased awareness of history and the slow awakening of nationalist ideas after the founding of the German Empire in 1871. Since 1892, there has been a Society for the Preservation of Lichtenberg Castle, which was refounded in 1995 as the \\"Friends of Lichtenberg Castle\\" (200 members). In 1861 the bergfried, which had become a ruin, collapsed and was demolished. Around 1900, the preservation society built a new tower on the old foundations, with the same hexagonal plan, which today has a wooden viewing platform with a height of about 25 metres. From the observation deck there are good views over the Harz Foreland to the Brocken. Investigations of the castle well showed it to be about 60 m deep and dug by hand. Since 2005, there has been a replica trebuchet, a medieval catapult engine, on the castle site. Next to the castle is a tourist restaurant with a beer garden and hotel.

He represented Vancouver East in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1966 to 1976 and from 1986 to 1991 as a New Democratic Party (NDP) member.  Life and career  He was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, and was educated at the University of British Columbia, graduating from the School of Community and Regional Planning (SCARP). Williams worked as a town planning consultant. He served as an alderman for Vancouver from 1964 to 1966. From 2004 to 2006, he was a member of the Vancouver City Planning Commission, serving as its Chair in 2005. He served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Lands, Forests and Water Resources from 1972 to 1975.  Political legacy  In that capacity, Williams was responsible, or co-responsible, for the Royal Commission on Forestry (the Pearce Report); the Columbia Basin Trust; the purchase and management of Ocean Falls pulp and paper mills and township; the acquisition and management of Columbia Cellulose, renamed Canadian Cellulose, a sulphite, sawmill, and bleached kraft mills operation in Prince Rupert, Terrace, and Castlegar; the BC Assessment Authority; the Agricultural Land Reserve and Commission; the first resort-municipality in Canada, created for the Whistler/Blackcomb complex; as Minister of Parks, a doubling of Provincial Park acreage in British Columbia, including creation of the Spatsizi Plateau Wilderness Provincial Park, protecting 1.6 million acres and the largest known herd of woodland caribou; Robson Square and its attendant Law Courts in downtown Vancouver; refurbishment and operation of the SS Princess Marguerite electric- diesel ferry service from Victoria to Seattle; and, expansion of the role and authority of the Environment and Land Use Secretariat. Later, as Deputy Minister for Crown Corporations, Williams helped lead creation of the West Coast Express, a new commuter train system running from the SkyTrain / SeaBus / Canada Line Waterfront Station in downtown Vancouver, in the former CPR Station, along CPR tracks to Mission, British Columbia, a distance of 69 km (43 miles). It began operation on 1 November 1995, and incorporates eight station stops altogether. In 2015, annual ridership was reported at just under 3 million passengers. Williams resigned his seat in 1976 to allow Dave Barrett to be reelected to the assembly. The Forensic Audit of the Nanaimo Commonwealth Holding Society revealed that Williams received $80,000, 4 years pay for an MLA at the time, from the NCHS. NDP MP and MLA David Stupich was convicted for taking that money away from Nanaimo Charities, using a small part to pay Williams, and passing some of it along to the NDP and to Unions such as the IWA. http://martinandassociates.ca/wp- content/uploads/2011/07/40-Article-RCMP-Drops-NDP-Bombshell- Sun-29March19961.pdf  Whistler Village  Seeing the potential that the area had to become a world-class ski destination, Williams was instrumental in saving Blackcomb Mountain from logging and establishing Whistler Village and the governing jurisdiction of the Resort Municipality of Whistler. In the early 1970s Al Raine, a former Canadian national ski team coach, and his Olympian wife Nancy Greene sent Williams a letter pleading government action to stop the imminent logging of Blackcomb. Raine would also later have an instrumental role in designing and structuring the emergence of Whistler Village. Whistler as a ski resort municipal jurisdiction was to be an experiment for the provincial government, and if successful the model was intended to be replicated elsewhere in B.C. to create more tourism hubs.  Railway Club  In 1981, Williams purchased the Railway Club at 579 Dunsmuir in Vancouver. First opened as a working class bar in 1931, he opened it up to young musicians making careers in jazz, pop, country, rock, and fusions of same. Such artists as k.d. lang, Spirit of the West, Herald Nix and the Blue Shadows pioneered the place, and were later joined by innumerable Metro Vancouver musicians, and by such international acts as Cowboy Junkies, Blue Rodeo, The Tragically Hip, Barenaked Ladies, Los Lobos, Jonathan Richman, Green on Red and T Bone Burnett. He sold the club in 2008.  Surrey Central City  On 31 July 1998, Williams became the chair of ICBC. With the approval of Glen Clark’s NDP government, he dedicated $250 million of the crown corporation’s capital reserves to fund the construction of the Central City development – a 25-storey, 1.7-million-square-foot office tower and shopping mall expansion project. The award-winning development, designed by Bing Thom, was driven forward as a catalyst for the revitalization and redevelopment of Whalley into Surrey’s downtown core.  Vancity Credit Union  Williams served on the Board of Directors for Vancity Credit Union, Canada's largest credit union, from 1983 to 1995 and from 2007 to 2016. The Vancity Years: First Period. In 1983, Vancity had nearly $1.5B CDN in assets. Loan delinquency, while below its 1982 peak, remained fairly constant. That year the Board approved a loan loss provision of $6.5M, about .66% of loans to credit union members. Williams’ initial role on the Board was to ensure management had conducted due diligence in assessing loan quality. By 1986, the balance of non-productive loans was $3.7M, reduced by 1989 to $1.8M. During Williams’ first five years as Director, Vancity became the first financial institution in Canada to introduce ATMs. The credit union’s community role had been limited to philanthropy (about $60K in grants), and social and co-op housing loans (about $42M). With Williams on the Board the credit union began lending to business. Vancity’s book of business was previously confined to personal mortgages, personal financing and commercial mortgages. This shift to business lending with a focus on economic development was the precursor to Vancity’s social business model which developed over the ensuing decade. A seed capital program was launched in 1985, designed to support businesses that didn’t qualify for conventional financing. By 1986 Vancity had financed nearly 600 business loans under this program. Williams became the Chair of the Board in 1988. That year his Chair’s message introduced the idea of Vancity setting community and social objectives, and becoming a more entrepreneurial institution: “As [Vancity’s] business performance improves [we] expect to do more innovative work in the social sphere.” The assets were now $1.7 B, and advancing social innovation was now an overt part of the agenda. Together with other Directors, Williams led creation of the Vancity Community Foundation. In 1989, the Foundation was endowed with $1.2M. Even after dividends, income taxes and this donation, net earnings were $5.3M, a significant improvement from the previous year, and up from $2M in 1984 five years earlier. The Foundation was to act as a catalyst for the growth and empowerment of disadvantaged groups and communities served by Vancity through providing loans, technical assistance or funds for community economic development and housing alternatives. Williams also led the creation of Vancity Enterprises Ltd in 1989, which was established as a wholly owned real estate investment and development subsidiary of the credit union. Its mandate was to provide affordable housing through innovative development strategies involving community groups, churches and governments. In its first year, Vancity Enterprises (VCE) worked on several mixed-used commercial and social housing developments. By the time of Williams’ third year as Chair (1990), Vancity’s assets totaled $2.26B, with profits before taxes and dividends exceeding $9.3M. In his Chair’s message, Williams introduced the idea of “social accounting”. He listed Vancity’s social achievements, including lending programs for women working at home and peer lending under the auspices of the Vancity Community Foundation. Vancity Enterprise was building a new branch with 34 apartment units on the upper three floors for single parents. That year Vancity extended a loan to the Sher-A-Punjab, a community centre initiated by the Sikh community in North Surrey, and created the EnviroFund, which allocated a percentage of Vancity Visa card revenues to environmental initiatives. As Vancity’s rules limit director terms to 12 years, Williams retired from the Board in 1995. He continued his role as a volunteer advisor on a number of projects, including the creation of the Vancity Capital Corporation, founded in 1997, which Vancity capitalized with $25M. Its purpose was to provide subordinated debt financing to growing companies, especially those which had a social mandate. Williams was Founding Board Chairperson at Vancity Capital, and hired its first CEO, David Mowat, who remained as CEO until recruited to be the Vancity Credit Union CEO in 2000. Williams also led efforts to establish the Bologna Summer Program. It was created in 2001, and jointly managed by Vancity, the University of Bologna and the BC Cooperative Association. Its purpose was and remains the training of Vancity staff and associates in the mechanics of cooperative enterprise, the idea of a social dividend, and the strengthening of the co-op credit model in every aspect. He particularly engaged the well-known scholar of co-operative economics, Pier Luigi Sacco, in this international model. It continues today. The Vancity Years: Second Period, 2007 - 2016. Beginning in 2013, as a member of the Board of Vancity, and later as Chair of the Jim Green Foundation, Williams also helped lead the re-purposing, re-design, and re-construction of the former Vancouver Police Department Main Station. Closed by the City in 2011, the old 312 Main Street Station is now becoming a 100,000 sq ft Centre for Social and Economic Innovation. It has to some extent been modeled on the Toronto Centre for Social Innovation.Centre for Social Innovation  Personal  He was the grandson of Bill Pritchard and the great-grandson of James Pritchard, early socialist pioneers in British Columbia. In 2012, Williams was made an Honorary Member of the Architectural Institute of British Columbia, in recognition of his contribution to urban design, planning, and building in that province. On 15 March 2017, Simon Fraser University announced the granting of a Doctor of Laws, Honoris Causa, to Williams: \\"His leadership, inspiration and action over the past 60 years have helped to improve and transform B.C.'s rural and urban communities, and the lives of its citizens.\\"  References  5\\\\. http://seniorsstories.vcn.bc.ca/2014/11/21/former-east-van-mla-bob-williams- on-his-childhood-days/ Category:1933 births Category:British Columbia New Democratic Party MLAs Category:Canadian consultants Category:Drinking establishment owners Category:Living people Category:Members of the Executive Council of British Columbia Category:Nightclub owners Category:Vancouver city councillors Category:University of British Columbia alumni Category:20th- century Canadian politicians Category:Vancity ","title":"Robert Arthur Williams"},{"id":"34316167","text":"The slender mudskipper (Periophthalmus gracilis) is a species of mudskippers native to marine and brackish waters of the eastern Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean where it is an inhabitant of the intertidal zone, capable of spending time out of water.

The judges were Langa CJ, Moseneke DCJ, Madala J, Mokgoro J, Ngcobo J, Nkabinde J, O'Regan J, Sachs J, Skweyiya J, Van Der Westhuizen J and Yacoob J.  Facts  When the applicant (the insured) instituted action in a High Court against the respondent (the insurer) on a short-term insurance contract, the insurer raised a special plea that it had been released from liability under the contract, since the applicant had failed to institute the action within the time period specified in the contract, namely ninety days from the date of repudiation of the claim. The applicant replicated that the time-limitation clause was unconstitutional and unenforceable because it violated his right under the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa to have the matter determined by a court.s 34. The High Court upheld the applicant's contention, made an order declaring the time-limitation clause to be inconsistent with the Constitution and dismissed the special plea. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA), it was found that section 34 of the Constitution did not prevent time-bar provisions in contracts that were entered into freely and voluntarily, but that it could not be determined on the evidence whether the clause under consideration had been entered into freely and voluntarily. The SCA accordingly upheld the appeal (and the special plea). The applicant then approached the Constitutional Court (CC) for leave to appeal against the decision of the SCA. Before the CC, the respondent contended inter alia that the provisions of section 34 had no application to constitutional challenges to contractual terms.  Judgment  The CC held that public policy has to be determined with reference to the Constitution, so that a contractual term which violates the Constitution is by definition contrary to public policy and therefore unenforceable.Para 29. The proper approach to constitutional challenges to contractual terms is to determine whether the term challenged is contrary to public policy as evidenced by South Africa's constitutional values, in particular those found in the Bill of Rights.Para 30. Section 34, therefore, not only reflected the foundational values that underlie the constitutional order, but also constituted public policy.Para 33. The court determined that the proper approach to the present matter was to determine whether the time-limitation clause violated section 34 of the Constitution and was thus contrary to public policy.Para 36. As a matter of public policy, the court held # that, subject to considerations of reasonableness and fairness, time-limitation clauses in contracts are permissible; and # that the right to seek judicial redress (as guaranteed by section 34) may be limited in circumstances where ## it is sanctioned by a law of general application; and ## the limitation is reasonable and justifiable.Para 48. It approved the words of Cameron JA that, While it is therefore necessary to recognise the doctrine of pacta sunt servanda, the courts may decline the enforcement of a time-limitation clause if its implementation would result in unfairness or would be unreasonable for being contrary to public policy.Para 70. The test for reasonableness, the court found, was whether or not the clause afforded the claimant an adequate and fair opportunity to seek judicial redress. If a contractual term provides only for an impossibly short time for the dispute to be referred to a court of law, it is contrary to public policy and unenforceable.Paras 52, 54. As to the requirement of fairness, the court laid out a two-part test: # whether the clause itself is unreasonable; and, if not, # whether it should be enforced in light of the circumstances that prevent compliance.Para 56. The first part entails a weighing-up of the principle of pacta sunt servanda and the right of all persons to seek judicial redress.Para 57. The second part entails proof by the claimant that he has good reason for his non-compliance with the time- limitation clause. In that regard, the relative equality or inequality of the bargaining positions of the parties is a relevant consideration.Paras 58, 59, 65. In the present case, # the ninety-day time limitation was not manifestly unreasonable; # nor was it manifestly unfair: There was no evidence that the contract had not been freely concluded between parties in equal bargaining positions or that the clause was not drawn to the applicant's attention. In the circumstances, enforcement of the clause would not be contrary to public policy.Paras 63, 66, 67. The difficulty in the present case was that the applicant had not furnished the reasons for his non-compliance with the time- limitation clause. Without those facts, the court was unable to say whether the enforcement of the clause against the applicant would be unfair and therefore contrary to public policy.Para 84. The Court was compelled to conclude, then, that enforcement of the clause would not be unjust to the applicant. It followed that the special plea was well taken.Para 86. The appeal was dismissed.

Durban's Water Wonderland found its defence in contract, claiming an exemption clause attached to the ticket. This clause was also displayed clearly on the window of the ticket office.

Story  According to legends, King Manan Singh was the king of Hathua. He considered himself to be the greatest devotee of Durga. Because of pride, they did not consider anyone to be a devotee of mother. In this state, there was a famine in the state and people started craving for food. Thaavu was a true devotee of the devout goddess mother in Thawe. According to the legend, Rahasu used to eat grass in the day with the grace of the mother and she used to get food from the night, due to which the people there started receiving food, but the king did not believe. The king asked Rahu to call the mother a croaking and call the mother. Rahushu often prayed to the king that if the mother comes here then the state will be ruined, but the king does not believe. On the prayer of Rahushu, all the buildings of the king who reached here, along with mother Kolkata, Patna and Ami, fell and the king died. Where the mother visited, there is a grand temple and there is a temple of Rahasu Bhagat at a distance. It is believed that those who come to see the mother also visit the temple of Rahasu Bhagat, otherwise their worship is considered incomplete. There is still the ruins of Manan Singh's buildings near this temple.  Fort Temple  The temple is in the structure of a fort that is surrounded from all sides, on the bank of the River Ganga. It lies in the flood-prone district of Saran and it is very near the Ganges. The Ganga takes a curb at this point going to South. The image of the Ganga at this point is Lingvat. Even during a flood, the Ganga never touches the fort. The entire structure of Temple is on debris. During 1973 the then Director of the Department of Archaeology of the Government of Bihar Sri Prakash Chandra excavated and found a wall made of bricks used during the Pala Dynasty. In the worship of Sakti an equidistant triangle has the same importance as Saligram for Lord Vishnu and Shiva Ling for Lord Shiva. The centre of the triangle is called Prambika Or Ambika. Surprisingly the distance of the three Shiv Temples (Baidyanath, Vishwanath and Pashupatinath) are equal and if you draw an imaginary line connecting the three Shiva Temple it will an equidistant triangle with Ambika Asthan Ami in the centre. This shows the importance of Ambika Asthan Ami. This place is also said to be the same place where King Surath & Samadhi Vaishya, performed AGYA for three years and got the desire fulfilled with the grace of Divine mother. It is also said that the place Digwara was originally called Drigdwara. This was the main gate of the palace of Daksh Prajapati where he organised Yagna. The palace was destroyed by Maa Sati. There are many other places claiming the same importance but in view of the fact that the incidence of Sati Sacrifice took place in Adi Satya Yuga (beginning of 1st age) and has been repeated in every Satya Yuga such claim and counterclaim can not be denied. There is a belief associated with the temple is that one who worships over here, his/her wishes get fulfilled by the Goddess. Hence in Dusshera, worshippers from different places gather here to obtain the divine blessing. Important Festivals  Navratri  As the temple is devoted to Goddess Ambika, Navratri is celebrated and there is one small village fair also organised by the local people of Aami village.  Shivratri  Shivratri is organised with quite a lot of excitement among the local people, as this was the place where the marriage ceremony of Shiv and Sati took place.  Shiv-Vivah  This festival is of high importance being organised in the manner of the marriage of Shiv and Sati. From one side the bride prepares and from one side comes the groom; according to this a fairy marriage ceremony is organised in a holy Hindu way.  Transportation  The nearest airport is Jayprakash Narayan Airport patna at a distance of about 57 km from the temple. The Aami Village lies on the roadside of NH 19. It connects with the major cities of Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar. Aami is itself a railway station.

In 1967, he ran again for reelection and won against NP Congressman Pablo Ocampo. His victory along with his party council members in Manila was the only major victory enjoyed by the Liberal Party (LP) in 1967. All of the LP senatorial candidates except for Benigno \\"Ninoy\\" Aquino were defeated by the opposing Nacionalista Party. In 1971, then-Congressman Ramon Bagatsing was chosen by the Liberal Party to run for Manila Mayor. Vice-Mayor Felicisimo Cabigao remained NP's bet for mayor. Villegas was left without a party. He formed the Libre'ng Pilipino Party (LPP) to run for reelection as mayor. He selected journalist J.V. Cruz to be his running mate for vice mayor. In the 1971 local election, Villegas lost to Bagatsing. Death and legacy After losing in the 1971 local mayoral elections to then Manila Congressman Ramon Bagatsing, Villegas and his entire family emigrated to the United States. He remained in Reno, Nevada, until his death on November 16, 1984. His coffin was exhumed from Reno cemetery and flown to the Philippines in October 1997. Memorial ceremony was held in Manila City Hall. Eulogies by the Villegas family, then-Mayor Alfredo Lim, and Senator Blas Ople were given. Villegas's body was finally buried in a plot located along the rotunda of Manila North Cemetery. Writings *Manila, 1962: Mayor Antonio J.

It was heard in the Appellate Division on 20 October 1942, with judgment handed down on 26 November. De Wet CJ, Watermeyer JA, Tindall JA, Centlivres JA and Feetham JA were the judges.  Facts  The plaintiff, under an arrangement with the defendant, left his car at the latter's garage each day at a monthly charge. The defendant undertook to dust the car each day and polish it once a month. Inside the garage was a notice—\\"Cars garaged at owner's risk\\"—of which the plaintiff was aware. The car having been removed from the garage by a person employed by the defendant to look after the cars in the garage, and having been severely damaged in a collision with a building, the plaintiff claimed damages for breach of the defendant's obligation to keep the car safe in the garage. A Provincial Division, on appeal from a magistrate's court, awarded damages, and the defendant appealed.  Arguments  The point was taken for the first time in the litigation that the plaintiff was not the owner of the car, and that he had therefore failed to prove he had suffered damage.  Judgment  The court held that, under the circumstances, the defendant was under a contractual obligation to keep the car under his control in the garage. Having delegated the performance of that obligation to his servant, who had not performed such obligation, the defendant was liable in damages unless the condition as to owner's risk modified that position. The only risks which the plaintiff undertook to bear were risks attendant on the garaging of the car, not risks to which the car might be exposed if, in breach of the contract between the parties, it was taken out of the garage and into the public streets. Inasmuch as the plaintiff's locus standi had not been challenged in either of the courts below, and as the defendant himself in his plea had referred to the car as the plaintiff's car, it was far too late for the defendant to be raising such issue. The decision of the Cape Provincial Division, in Oliver v Weinberg, was thus confirmed.  See also  * Contract * South African contract law  References   Books  * Du Plessis, Jacques, et al.

The first concentration camp was created by Francisco Franco on July 20, 1936 and was located in the castle of El Hecho in Ceuta. The last concentration camp, located at Miranda de Ebro, was closed in 1947. Inmates of these concentration camps were republican ex-combatants of the Spanish Republican Army, Spanish Republican Air Force or the Spanish Republican Navy, as well as political dissidents, homosexuals, and regular convicts. From 1940, the supervisor of these camps was the general Camilo Alonso Vega. The main function of the camps was to detain Republican prisoners of war. Those who were regarded as \\"unrecoverable\\" were shot. The prisoners were used as forced labourers for reconstruction works (Belchite), to mine coal, extract mercury, build highways and dams, and dig canals. Furthermore, thousands were used in the construction of the Carabanchel Prison (Madrid), in the Arco de la Victoria (Madrid) and in the Valley of the Fallen (Cuelgamuros). Later their work was subcontracted to private companies and landowners, who used them to improve their properties.  History  According to Javier Rodrigo (2006), nearly half a million prisoners had been in concentration camps between the years 1936-1942. The first concentration camp was created on July 20, 1936 by Francisco Franco. Some historians have suggested that Nazi Gestapo officials organised the network of Francoist concentration camps, and that in large part they looked to Nazi Germany as inspiration for their own concentration camp system. Of these officials, Paul Winzer, the head of the Gestapo in Spain and once the head of the concentration camp at Miranda de Ebro, has been noted in particular. There are other historians who go further to argue that Winzer was the mastermind of the whole system of Francoist concentration camps. In 1938, Francoist concentration camps held more than 170,000 prisoners. After the end of the war, in 1939, the imprisoned population fluctuated between 367,000 and 500,000 people. From 1940, the overseer of all camps was the general Camilo Alonso Vega. The principal function of the camps was the continued detention of as many republican prisoners of war as possible; those that were classified as \\"irrecoverable\\" were automatically executed. Many of those in charge of the prisoners or the administration of the camps had been victimised in republican-controlled areas, and for that reason were eager to inflict revenge on the losing side. High-level officials were not generally opposed to this climate of revenge and repression: the Director General of Prisons, Máximo Cuervo Radigales, and the head of the Military Legal Corps, Lorenzo Martínez Fuset, were key contributors. In 1946, ten years after the start of the Spanish Civil War, 137 work camps were still operative and three concentration camps, in which more than 30,000 political prisoners were housed. The last concentration camp to close was in Miranda de Ebro, which was shut in January 1947.  List of concentration camps  More than 190 concentration camps, holding 170,000 prisoners in 1938 and between 367,000 and about half or less million prisoners when the war ended in 1939. All the camps were created during Spanish Civil War and a few were created in the following years. This is a partial list: * Los Merinales concentration camp, Dos Hermanas, Sevilla * La Corchuela concentration camp, Dos Hermanas, Sevilla * El Palmar de Troya concentration camp, Utrera, Sevilla * Hostal de San Marcos de León concentration camp, which held 7,000 men and 300 women from 1936 until 1939 * Miranda de Ebro concentration camp * Castuera concentration camp * Península de Llevant concentration camp, Mallorca * Formentera concentration camp * La Isleta concentration camp, Gran Canaria * Lazareto de Gando concentration camp, Gran Canaria * Cartuja de Porta Coeli concentration camp, Valencia * Los Almendros concentration camp, Alicante * Albatera concentration camp, Alicante * Pasaje Camposancos – A Guarda concentration camp * Ronda concentration camp, Málaga * Betanzos concentration camp * Horta concentration camp, Barcelona * Poblenou concentration camp, Barcelona * Monasterio de Corbán concentration camp, Santander * Soria concentration camp * Burgo de Osma concentration camp, Soria  See also  * Human rights in Spain * List of concentration and internment camps * Francoist Spain  References  Footnotes Bibliography   *  External links  * Campos de Concentración y Unidades Disciplinarias de Trabajadores de la España de Franco * El dolor como terapia.

They were the first ice hockey team representing Canada to wear a red maple leaf on their uniform. They enjoyed considerable success, winning British and European competitions. History The team was founded in 1905, and was composed primarily of Canadian students from Oxford University attending with a Rhodes Scholarship. Initially the Rhodes Scholars played for the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club, but were banned from playing in varsity matches against Cambridge in order to prevent \\"a massacre\\". The club were the English champions in 1907 and 1910, and subsequently participated in the 1910 European Championships. They played three games, which were not considered to be part of the official competition, and beat Switzerland 8–1, Germany 4–0 and Belgium 6–0. They did not play Princes Ice Hockey Club, who were representing Great Britain in the tournament. Great Britain won the tournament, but the Oxford Canadians were accepted as European Champions owing to their success in the competition. The Oxford Canadians began wearing a red maple leaf on their uniforms, the first hockey club representing Canada to do so. The maple leaf has been one of Canada's symbols since as early as the 18th century, and in 1965 the national flag of Canada was adopted with a maple leaf on it. The club became affiliated to the International Ice Hockey Federation in 1911. They were named English champions again in 1911, and participated in the 1912 LIHG Championships, which were unofficially considered to be \\"World Championships\\". The Oxford Canadians were the only \\"non-European\\" participants in the tournament, in which they finished second behind Berliner Schlittschuhclub, who were representing Germany in the competition. The club were the English champions for the fourth and final time in 1913. Ice hockey was suspended in the United Kingdom following the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.

In particular, in 1871-1872 he participated in the round-the-world journey. Still as a naval officer, in 1868 he started his art studies under the supervision of Alexey Bogolyubov. In 1873, Bogolyubov moved to France, and Beggrov, who wanted to continue his art studies, enrolled in the Royal Academy of Arts, where he studied under Mikhail Konstantinovich Clodt for a year. In 1874, he retired from the navy and moved to Paris, where he mainly continued to work under the guidance of Bogolyubov. He also got to know Russian artists working in France, including Ilya Repin. In 1875, Beggrov returned to Saint Petersburg, and in 1878, he joined the Society for Travelling Art Exhibitions. In 1879, he travelled by sea to Greece, and from there to France, where he stayed for two years. Subsequently, Alexander Beggrov moved back to Russia and settled in Gatchina. In 1903, his wife died.

Originally established by the Chinese Muslim explorer Zheng He (also known as Sanbao), it is now shared by Indonesians of multiple religious denominations, including Muslims and Buddhists, and ethnicities, including Chinese and Javanese. History The foundations of Sam Poo Kong were set when Chinese Muslim explorer Admiral Zheng He arrived in the western part of what is now Semarang via the Garang River; the year is disputed, with suggestions ranging from 1400 to 1416. After disembarking from his ships, Zheng found a cave in a rocky hillside and used it for prayer. He established a small temple before leaving Java but, having grown fond of the area, his deputy Wang Jing and several crewmen remained behind. A statuette of Zheng was installed in the cave. The original temple was reportedly destroyed in 1704, collapsing under a landslide. In October 1724 the temple was completely renovated. A new cave was made, next to the old one. In the middle of the 1800s Sam Poo Kong was owned by a Mr. Johanes, a landlord of Jewish descent, who charged devotees for the right to pray at the temple. Unable to pay individual fees, the Chinese community spent 2000 gulden yearly to keep the temple open; this was later reduced to 500 gulden after worshipers complained of the expense. As this was still a heavy burden, devotees abandoned Sam Poo Kong and found a statue of Zheng He to bring to Tay Kak Sie Temple, away, where they could pray freely. In 1879, Oei Tjie Sien, a prominent local businessman, bought the Sam Poo Kong complex and made its use free of charge; in response, local Chinese celebrated by holding a carnival and began returning to Sam Poo Kong. The temple's ownership was transferred to the recently founded Sam Poo Kong foundation in 1924. The temple received another full renovation in 1937. After the Japanese invasion of the Indies, the Japanese command installed electricity and provided the temple with a framed written appraisal for Zheng He. During five years of revolution after the Japanese left the newly independent Indonesia, the temple was poorly maintained and fell into disrepair. In 1950, Sam Poo Kong was again renovated. However, beginning in the 1960s increased political instability led to its being neglected again. From 2002 to 2005 it underwent another major renovation. Layout The Sam Poo Kong complex includes five temples in a mixed Chinese and Javanese architectural style. The temples are Sam Poo Kong (the oldest), Tho Tee Kong, Kyai Juru Mudi Temple, Kyai Jangkar Temple, and Kyai Cundrik Bumi Temple. An additional worship site, Mbah Kyai Tumpeng, is in the complex. The buildings are spread over . Tho Tee Kong (also known as Dewa Bumi Temple), is just within the large gate at the northern end of the complex; it is used by those who seek the blessings of the earth god Tu Di Gong. Next to Tho Tee Kong is Kyai Juru Mudi Temple, the burial site of Wang Jing Hong, one of Zheng He's deputies. It is often frequented by people looking for success in business. The main temple is built directly in front of the cave, south of Kyai Juru Mudi. In the cave are an altar, fortune-telling equipment, and a small statue of Zheng He. Underneath the altar is a well that is said to never go dry and to be capable of healing various ailments. Before the 2002 renovations, the temple measured . It now measures . Further south is the Kyai Jankar Temple, named after a sacred anchor used by Zheng He which is held inside. The temple contains an altar to Zheng's crewmen who died while fulfilling their duties. The southernmost temple is Kyai Cundrik Bumi, which is used to worship a weapon used by Zheng. Nearby is Mbah Kyai Tumpeng, a prayer site used by people wishing for their well-being. The main temple (left), Kyai Juru Mudi Temple (center), and Tho Tee Kong (right) Carnival Every lunar year on the 30th day of the sixth month, the anniversary of Zheng He's arrival in Semarang, Chinese Indonesians parade statues of Zheng He, Lauw In , and Thio Ke from Tay Kak Sie to Sam Poo Kong. Started after Sam Poo Kong again became free to use, the carnival is meant to show respect to the explorers.

Each series contains up to eight episodes consisting of single stories by writers and directors with no previous experience or less than two hours previous screentime, who are sourced through a talent scheme of the same name. Each series encompasses a wide range of genres and topics, using a range of both experienced and fresh actors. Episodes did not generally air in a single time slot or on a particular day, with many episodes broadcasting back to back. The series gathered considerable press attention, with The Independent writing: \\"Thank goodness for Coming Up... it's a genuinely interesting display of possibilities\\". In 2014, the talent scheme which recruited writers and directors for the series was revamped. A single screenplay, extended to ninety minutes, was to be produced using three writers from a pool of six and a single director. This version of the scheme ran for a second year in 2015. In 2016, the scheme was again revamped, and retitled as 4Stories. It encouraged applications from under-represented talent: women, disabled people, BAME, and people from disadvantaged backgrounds, to work on a series of three inter- connected half-hour films. Notable writers and directors who started with this program include Jack Thorne, Jon Sen, Tom Harper and Yann Demange. The series has also produced the debut writing credits of actor Christian Solimeno, actress Bronagh Taggart and presenter Rick Edwards.

The magazine published articles by famous European philologists Max Müller, John Mill, William Whitney, Ernest Renan, Georg Curtius, August Schleicher, Carl Becker, Karl Heyse, Hippolyte Taine, Louis Léger, Johan Lundell as well as translations of ancient authors Theophrastus, Euripides, Lucian, Horace, Cicero, Virgil. Numerous well-known individuals of the Russian Empire wrote pieces for the journal: *Alexander Afanasyev, *Fyodor Buslaev. *Jan Niecisław Baudouin de Courtenay, *Yakov Grot. *Alexander Veselovsky, *Vladimir Dal, *Izmail Sreznevsky etc. \\"Philological Notes\\" made perhaps the most significant contribution to the practical translation of scientific texts on philology and general linguistics into Russian in the 19th century. Only four articles on these subjects had been translated into Russian before Alexey Khovansky began his work, and only one of these from English. One of Khovansky’s first successes was the translation of Max Muller’s lectures at Oxford University. They were published in Russian in Voronezh only three years after their presentation at Oxford in 1863 – a speed which is amazing even in our times, not to mention the 19th century. In those years, the journal’s main direction of research was comparative linguistics, which served as the basis for Ethnology and Cultural Anthropology. One other translation from English was the work of William Whitney, the founder of the American linguistic school: “The Life and Growth of Language: An Outline of Linguistic Science”. In 1867, the journal published a translation of John Mill’s article \\"The Value of Art in the General System of Education\\". Many articles in the magazine are unique. In the 19th century the magazine received the recognition not only throughout Russia but also at the universities of Paris, Leipzig, Prague, Zagreb, Berlin, Jena, Vienna, Uppsala, Strasbourg, and in America. Prior to the organization in 1879 in Warsaw \\"Russian Philological Bulletin\\", the magazine remained the only special periodical in Russia devoted to the problems of philology and the teaching of Russian language and literature. Founded by Alexei Khovansky in 1860, the journal was published regularly until 1917. Comparative linguistics was classified in the USSR as \\"bourgeois science,\\" many scientists were persecuted. The magazine was closed down in 1917 but resurfaced many years later in 1993 at the Faculty of Philology of Voronezh State University.Voronezh encyclopedia, 2008.

Life  Charles Frederick was a son of the Duke Christian Ulrich I of Württemberg-Oels (1652–1704) from his second marriage to Duchess Sibylle Marie (1667–1693), daughter of the Duke Christian I of Saxe- Merseburg. When his father died in 1704, Charles Frederick was still a minor, so he stood under guardianship until he was declared an adult in 1707. Charles Frederick married on 21 April 1709 in Stuttgart with Sibylle Charlotte (1690–1735), the daughter of Duke Frederick Ferdinand of Württemberg- Weiltingen, a grandson of Julius Frederick, Duke of Württemberg-Weiltingen. From 1738, he acted as guardian of Duke Charles Eugene and regent of Württemberg. In this rôle, he succeeded Duke Charles Rudolph of Württemberg- neuenstadt, who had resigned from the regency for reasons of old age. During his time as regent, the War of the Austrian Succession broke out in 1740. In 1742,the Treaty of Breslau awarded his homeland Silesia to Prussia. Nevertheless, Charles Frederick and his successors did not participate in this war. During his regency, the administration was significantly improved and good relations with the Estates were restored. Georg Bernhard Bilfinger, Johann Eberhard Georgii and Frederick Augustus von Hardenberg served as ministers in his government. In 1744, Emperor Charles VII declared Charles Eugene an adult, thereby ending Charles Frederick time as regent of Württemberg. Charles Frederick's marriage remained childless. In 1744, he resigned from the government in Oels, in favour of the son of his younger brother Charles Christian Erdmann. He then resided for some time in Międzybórz, and then moved to Oels, where he died in 1761, at the age of 72.

Mistakenly sent early, Perth officials obtained it. Jack O'Dea of Perth signed Walker just before the start of the 1952 season. He played two games in the seconds before making his debut against West Perth. He won the best and fairest for Perth in 1955 and 1956, runner-up in his last full season in 1963. He topped the club's goal kicking in 1953, his record of 410 goals one of the highest on Perth's all-time goalkickers list. He made his debut for Western Australia against Victoria at the MCG in 1955, kicking two of their three goals for the game. He represented Western Australia ten times. In 1961, he was assistant coach to Bob Miller. Miller was sacked early in the season, Walker was elevated to the coaching position, but on the insistence of the club, he was a non-playing coach, meaning Walker did not play until 1962, when he was made assistant to Ern Henfry. In 1964, Walker retired after 226 games. He was nicknamed \\"Dickie\\" because his father and grandfather were also named Frank.  References  * Footy Goss: Where are they now?

It was heard in the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) on 4 September 2006, with judgment handed down on 29 September. The judges were Zulman JA, Farlam JA, Conradie JA, Mlambo JA and Maya JA. Counsel for the appellant was AR Sholto-Douglas SC (with him S Miller); RS van der Riet SC appeared for the respondent. Facts The respondent, Hircock, had sustained injuries as a result of a motor vehicle accident negligently caused by an employee of Drifter's Adventure Tours, the appellant, while she had been a passenger on a tour arranged by Drifter's. She claimed damages. Drifter's declared that it was excluded from such liability on the basis of an indemnity form signed by Hircock before the tour. The front of the form had a wide indemnity clause and a statement that the conditions on the reverse had been read, fully understood and accepted. These reverse conditions contained a more limited clause that exempted Drifter's from liability arising from, inter alia, \\"the nature of hiking, camping, touring, driving.\\" The Court a quo held that the form did not exempt Drifter's from liability.  Judgment  On appeal, the SCA affirmed that indemnity provisions in general should be construed restrictively,Para 9. and that the wider indemnity clause had to be read and interpreted in the context of the contract as whole, including its reverse side.Para 10. In case of doubt, an exemption clause reasonably capable of bearing more than one meaning should be given the interpretation least favourable to, and with a bias against, the proferens.Para 13. The court said that it was possible to interpret the expression \\"driving\\" as driving anywhere in the country and on any terrain, including passenger transportation on a public road. The reasonable reader, however, would probably not interpret it in this way, and so, in light of established interpretative canons, the court did not favour this interpretation. The word \\"driving\\" occurred in the context of other adventure activities; it therefore made better sense to understand it to entail driving over unmade roads or slippery, steep or otherwise exciting terrain.Para 14. Since Drifter's, as a cross-border tour operator, was statutorily obliged to have passenger liability insurance, it would be perverse for it to have contracted out of this liability altogether.Para 16. The appeal was accordingly dismissedPara 17. and the decision in the Cape Provincial Division, in Hircock v Drifters Adventure Tours CC, confirmed.

It is known as the location of Gurdwara Baba Bakala Sahib. History Baba Bakala is closely associated with the 9th Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Tegh Bahadur. The Guru is said to have meditated here for 26 years, 9 months and 13 days. There is a Gurdwara at the site commemorating this. Baba Bakala was originally known as Bakkan-Wala (meaning 'Town of the Deer' in Persian) however over time this was shortened to Bakala. The town was originally a mound, where deer were found grazing. Before passing away in Delhi, the Guru at the time, Guru Har Krishan uttered \\"Baba Bakale\\" which the Sikhs at the time interpreted as meaning that the Guru's successor was to be found at the town of Bakala, close to Amritsar. Once the next Guru was found, the phrase \\"Baba Bakale\\" evolved into the official name of the town, Baba Bakala. Geography Baba Bakala is located at , on Batala Road, near Amritsar, Punjab, India. The town is located only 43 km (26.7 miles) away from the Golden Temple in the city of Amritsar, 46.5 km (28.9 miles) northwest of Jalandhar and 193 km (120.5 miles) northwest of the state's capital of Chandigarh. Demographics According to the 2011 census of India, the population of Baba Bakala is 8946. There are 1,834 households, 4,697 males and 4,249 females. Thus the corresponding sex ratio is 905 women per 1000 men. Religion Sikhism is the most prominent religion of the town. Other minorities includes Hinduism and Jainism. Bhullar Jatts and Shukla Pandits were the original inhabitants of the town when it was founded as a village. There were few Muslim households, who migrated elsewhere during the 1947 Partition of India and up until 1955 there was a Mosque as well. There is an Ancient Shiva Temple in the centre of the town which still exists. Politics Baba Bakala Sahib's constituency is mainly led by the Shiromani Akali Dal party. Many political leaders such as Jiwan Singh Umranangal, Babu Karam Singh Bal, Shaheed Darshan Singh Pheruman, Sohan Singh Jallalusman and Dalip Singh Mehta belonged to this constituency. These politicians played a large role in the politics of Punjab. The foundation stone of the Baba Bakala Sahib tehsil was laid by Jiwan Singh Umranangal. Sardar Dasuanda Singh bhullar was popularly known as wattvalan due to his contribution in allotting his own land for making way for hospital he is not mentioned as he didn't wanted to popularise his name and he has also met many renowned persons like Mr Gianni zail singh (then prime minister of India), Sardar Pratap Singh kairon Sardar Mohan singh nagoke Sardar Sohan Singh Jallalusma and many more.

The hotel affords views over the Atlantic coast and the glacier-topped Snæfellsjökull volcano and glacier, and is located in a protected nature reserve. The hotel is a three-hour drive north from Keflavík International Airport. History The hotel originally opened as a guesthouse and fish restaurant in 1947 on the site of an old apartment-store complex. It was converted to a limited-liability company in 1956. Icelandic author and Nobel prize winner Halldor Laxness was a frequent guest in the hotel, writing in a room which had views over the Snæfellsjökull glacier. The Icelandic painter Johannes Kjarval also stayed there. The hotel was completely destroyed by a fire on 21 February 2001, and the current hotel building was constructed on the site, opening as a hotel on 14 June 2003. The hotel now has 28 bedrooms, varying in size, aspect and amenities, and the hotel restaurant can seat eighty people. Local amenities and activities The only other building in the vicinity is Búðir church, a tiny black wooden nineteenth century building, just a few minutes' walk from the hotel. Some hotel guests use Búðir as a wedding venue. Other activities include horse riding, glacier tours, sailing and hiking.

Muons are a type of lepton that occurs only in high-energy collisions caused by cosmic rays or induced in particle accelerators. Previous lepton colliders have all used electrons, or their anti-particles, positrons. They offer an advantage over hadron colliders, such as the CERN-based Large Hadron Collider, in that lepton collisions are relatively \\"clean.\\" Leptons are considered elementary particles, while hadrons, such as protons, are composite particles. While being an elementary particle with low mass, like other leptons, a muon has a rest mass that is higher by a factor of approximately 200 than that of electrons. Thus, synchrotron radiation emitted from a muon is a factor of roughly 109 less than from an electron. The reduced radiation loss enables the construction of circular colliders with much higher design energies than equivalent electron / positron colliders. This permits high energies to be achieved while maintaining a clean collision environment. It has been shown that a muon collider could achieve energies in the teraelectronvolt range.Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Center for Beam Physics [Retrieved 2012-01-08] Muons are short-living with a lifetime of 2.2 μs in their rest frame. This is a serious challenge for a muon collider: It has to produce new muons frequently and accelerate and collide them as quickly as possible before too many muons decay. Colliders using stable particles can store them for minutes to hours.

She was abbess of the secular Gandersheim Abbey and later Duchess of Brunswick-Grubenhagen by marriage.  Life  Clara was the youngest daughter of the Duke Henry II of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1489–1568) from his first marriage with Maria (1496–1541), daughter of the Earl Henry of Württemberg.  Abbess of Gandersheim  At the urging of her father, Clara was elected abbess of Gandersheim Abbey after the death of her sister Maria. Since Clara was only 6 years old at the time, officials acting for her father administered the abbey in her name. It is unknown if the Pope ever confirmed Clara as abbess. In any case, she never took up the position. In 1542, troops of the Schmalkaldic League occupied Gandersheim and forced the Abbey to convert to Lutheranism. The Chapter, however, practiced passive resistance and remained Catholic. In 1543, the abbey suffered from iconoclasm. In 1547, Clara's father declared her resignation from the office of abbess, returning to the lay state.  Duchess of Brunswick-Grubenhagen  Clara married on 1 July 1560 in Wolfenbüttel with her cousin Duke Philip II of Brunswick-Grubenhagen (1533–1596).Pierre Hélyot: P.

After their marriage, the couple moved to Katlenburg Castle and converted it to a Renaissance château. Clara was responsible for the installation of numerous pharmacies and destileries. She also designed the interior of the newly built church in Rotenkirchen. When Clara's brother Julius inherited Wolfenbüttel in 1568, he also took possession of Westerhof. Clara sued him before the Aulic Council, but in 1580, Philip confirmed Juilius's ownership. Clara then sued Julius over the inheritance of her sister Margaret. The Aulic Council created an imperial commission to look into the matter. Julius, however, rejected the commission and filed a complaint at the Diet of Augsburg of 1582 about the illegal practices of his sister. Clara and her court moved from Katlenburg Castle to Herzberg Castle. She died in 1595, after a long illness. The court preacher and superintendent Andreas Georg Leopold delivered her funeral sermon, which was also published in printed form.Georg Max: Geschichte des Fürstenthums Grubenhagen,Schmorl & Seefeld, 1863 S. 269 Clara was buried in the Aegidius Church in Osterode am Harz.

The English term scroll is more often used in English, especially when the pattern is regular, repeating along a narrow zone. In English \\"rinceau\\" tends to be used where the design spreads across a wider zone, in a similar style to an Islamic arabesque pattern. The use of rinceaux is frequent in the friezes of Roman buildings, where it is generally found in a frieze, the middle element of an entablature, just below the cornice. It is also decorated in the jamb ornaments and capitals of Romanesque structures and in friezes and panels of buildings in the various Renaissance styles, where tiny animals or human heads also appear.Cf. J. Ward, Historic Ornament: Treatise on Decorative Art and Architectural Ornament, BiblioBazaar (2009), s.v. Rinceau. The rinceau experienced a return to the simpler Classic style in the 17th century, and in the subsequent century it was applied more freely, without a strict repetition of identical forms.Cf. A.

He enjoyed the confidence of the English Crown and was on good terms with successive Deputies, including Sir Edward Bellingham, Sir James Croft and Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex. He is chiefly remembered as a soldier, and he played a leading role in all the military expeditions of his time. His most famous campaign was against the Scots at Lecale in 1551.

Isora learned her baseball skills from her father, Argelio del Castillo, a well-respected amateur shortstop in Cuba. She followed the steps of her father at shortstop, and also played efficiently at second base and third base. In 1947, at age 15, she played third base for the Habaneras, one of two women's teams that roamed Cuba playing games with each other. (Article in Spanish) The first AAGPBL spring training outside the United States was held in Cuba in 1947, as part of a plan to create an International League of Girls Baseball. The experiment took shape when Cuban executives Alfonso Rodríguez and Rafael León and AAGPBL president Max Carey formed two teams, one called the Cubans and the other called the Americans. Both teams toured Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico and Venezuela, playing exhibition games with each other. After that, Isora and her aforementioned fellows were contracted by the AAGPBL between 1948 and 1949.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book She was assigned to the Chicago Colleens development team in 1949.1949 Chicago Colleens. Retrieved 2019-03-28. The next season, she gained promotion to the Kalamazoo Lassies, playing for them one and a half years before joining the Kenosha Comets during the 1951 midseason. Isora retired after marrying Raymundo Kinney. After baseball, she worked in electronics for 40 years and became a hospital volunteer.The Women of the All- American Girls Professional Baseball League In 1988, she became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Another tribute to the AAGPBL players came with the 1992 film A League of Their Own, featuring Tom Hanks, Geena Davis and Madonna, and directed by filmmaker Penny Marshall.IMDb.com – A League of Their Own (1992 film) In 2011, she and her AAGPBL teammates from Cuba were honored by having their names and photos presented at a ceremony in New York City. The event was presented by Leslie Heaphy, history professor at Kent State University of Ohio, during the Cuban Baseball Congress held on August 20 at Fordham University. In addition, Isora del Castillo is the only woman enshrined in the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame, having been elected in 1997. She currently lives in Oklahoma.

A bus of this type is to be contrasted with an articulated or bi-articulated bus, which will have two or more two rigid sections linked by a pivoting joint,also with a trailer bus, which is formed out of a bus bodied semi-trailer pulled by a conventional tractor unit. The term \\"rigid bus\\" is used mainly in British English and Australian English and usually only when distinguishing such buses from articulated buses, such as describing a fleet that includes both types. In the case of two-axle buses, which must be single- chassis, rigid vehicles, British English often refers to such vehicles as \\"two-axle\\" buses, only using the term \\"rigid\\" when referring to vehicles with three or more axles, which can be either rigid or articulated. The term \\"rigid bus\\" is not used in American English, where the distinction is commonly made using the term \\"non-articulated\\" bus or, when the context is clear, \\"standard bus\\". However, the term \\"standard bus\\" can be confusing, because it is sometimes used, in other English-speaking countries, referring to a uniform bus design developed for and by a number of European bus manufacturers, in two model generations, between the 1960s and the end of the 20th century. The German VöV-Standard-Bus includes the Mercedes-Benz O305 and the Mercedes-Benz O405 types, each of which, in both rigid and articulated forms, was widely acquired and used by bus operators in English-speaking countries outside North America. Rigid buses may be of either single-deck or double-deck design, and may have either two axles or multi-axles. However, the expression \\"rigid bus\\" is seldom used to describe a double-decker bus, because very few double-decker buses have anything other than a rigid chassis. Single-decker rigid buses are used mainly on bus lines with an average ridership (for example, as transit buses or regional buses on routes with normal levels of patronage), or as coaches.

It is the lowest energy state (the ground state) of the electromagnetic field when the fields are quantized. When Planck's constant is hypothetically allowed to approach zero, QED vacuum is converted to classical vacuum, which is to say, the vacuum of classical electromagnetism. Another field-theoretic vacuum is the QCD vacuum of the Standard Model. A Feynman diagram (box diagram) for photon-photon scattering, one photon scatters from the transient vacuum charge fluctuations of the other Fluctuations The video of an experiment showing vacuum fluctuations (in the red ring) amplified by spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The QED vacuum is subject to fluctuations about a dormant zero average-field condition: Here is a description of the quantum vacuum: Virtual particles It is sometimes attempted to provide an intuitive picture of virtual particles based upon the Heisenberg energy-time uncertainty principle: :\\\\Delta E \\\\Delta t \\\\ge \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} \\\\, , (where and are energy and time variations, and the Planck constant divided by 2) arguing along the lines that the short lifetime of virtual particles allows the \\"borrowing\\" of large energies from the vacuum and thus permits particle generation for short times. This interpretation of the energy-time uncertainty relation is not universally accepted, however. One issue is the use of an uncertainty relation limiting measurement accuracy as though a time uncertainty determines a \\"budget\\" for borrowing energy . Another issue is the meaning of \\"time\\" in this relation, because energy and time (unlike position and momentum , for example) do not satisfy a canonical commutation relation (such as ). Various schemes have been advanced to construct an observable that has some kind of time interpretation, and yet does satisfy a canonical commutation relation with energy. The many approaches to the energy-time uncertainty principle are a continuing subject of study. Quantization of the fields The Heisenberg uncertainty principle does not allow a particle to exist in a state in which the particle is simultaneously at a fixed location, say the origin of coordinates, and has also zero momentum. Instead the particle has a range of momentum and spread in location attributable to quantum fluctuations; if confined, it has a zero-point energy. An uncertainty principle applies to all quantum mechanical operators that do not commute. In particular, it applies also to the electromagnetic field. A digression follows to flesh out the role of commutators for the electromagnetic field. :The standard approach to the quantization of the electromagnetic field begins by introducing a vector potential and a scalar potential to represent the basic electromagnetic electric field and magnetic field using the relations: ::\\\\begin{align}\\\\mathbf B &= \\\\mathbf { abla \\\\times A}\\\\,, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf E &= -\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\mathbf{A} - \\\\mathbf{ abla}V \\\\, . \\\\end{align} :The vector potential is not completely determined by these relations, leaving open a so-called gauge freedom. Resolving this ambiguity using the Coulomb gauge leads to a description of the electromagnetic fields in the absence of charges in terms of the vector potential and the momentum field , given by: :: \\\\mathbf \\\\Pi = \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\frac{ \\\\partial }{\\\\partial t} \\\\mathbf A \\\\, , :where is the electric constant of the SI units. Quantization is achieved by insisting that the momentum field and the vector potential do not commute. That is, the equal-time commutator is: ::\\\\bigl[\\\\Pi_i(\\\\mathbf{r}, t),\\\\ A_j(\\\\mathbf{r}', t)\\\\bigr]=-i\\\\hbar \\\\delta_{ij}\\\\delta (\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}')\\\\, , :where , are spatial locations, is Planck's constant over 2, is the Kronecker delta and is the Dirac delta function. The notation denotes the commutator. :Quantization can be achieved without introducing the vector potential, in terms of the underlying fields themselves: ::\\\\left[ \\\\hat{ E}_k (\\\\boldsymbol r ) , \\\\hat{ B}_{k'} (\\\\boldsymbol r') \\\\right] = -\\\\epsilon_{kk'm}\\\\frac{i \\\\hbar}{\\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\frac {\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_m} \\\\delta (\\\\boldsymbol{r-r'}) \\\\, , :where the circumflex denotes a Schrödinger time- independent field operator, and is the antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor. Because of the non-commutation of field variables, the variances of the fields cannot be zero, although their averages are zero. The electromagnetic field has therefore a zero-point energy, and a lowest quantum state. The interaction of an excited atom with this lowest quantum state of the electromagnetic field is what leads to spontaneous emission, the transition of an excited atom to a state of lower energy by emission of a photon even when no external perturbation of the atom is present. Electromagnetic properties The polarization of the observed light in the extremely strong magnetic field suggests that the empty space around the neutron star is subject to the vacuum birefringence. As a result of quantization, the quantum electrodynamic vacuum can be considered as a material medium. It is capable of vacuum polarization. In particular, the force law between charged particles is affected. The electrical permittivity of quantum electrodynamic vacuum can be calculated, and it differs slightly from the simple of the classical vacuum. Likewise, its permeability can be calculated and differs slightly from . This medium is a dielectric with relative dielectric constant > 1, and is diamagnetic, with relative magnetic permeability < 1. Under some extreme circumstances in which the field exceeds the Schwinger limit (for example, in the very high fields found in the exterior regions of pulsars), the quantum electrodynamic vacuum is thought to exhibit nonlinearity in the fields. Calculations also indicate birefringence and dichroism at high fields. Many of electromagnetic effects of the vacuum are small, and only recently have experiments been designed to enable the observation of nonlinear effects. PVLAS and other teams are working towards the needed sensitivity to detect QED effects. Attainability A perfect vacuum is itself only attainable in principle. It is an idealization, like absolute zero for temperature, that can be approached, but never actually realized: Virtual particles make a perfect vacuum unrealizable, but leave open the question of attainability of a quantum electrodynamic vacuum or QED vacuum. Predictions of QED vacuum such as spontaneous emission, the Casimir effect and the Lamb shift have been experimentally verified, suggesting QED vacuum is a good model for a high quality realizable vacuum. There are competing theoretical models for vacuum, however. For example, quantum chromodynamic vacuum includes many virtual particles not treated in quantum electrodynamics. The vacuum of quantum gravity treats gravitational effects not included in the Standard Model. It remains an open question whether further refinements in experimental technique ultimately will support another model for realizable vacuum. References \\\\ , where is the unit vector of , . For a discussion see, Classical vacuum is not a material medium, but a reference state used to define the SI units. Its permittivity is the electric constant and its permeability is the magnetic constant, both of which are exactly known by definition, and are not measured properties. See Mackay & Lakhtakia, p. 20, footnote 6. A vaguer description is provided by QCD vacuum is paramagnetic, while QED vacuum is diamagnetic. See For a review, see Quantities satisfying a canonical commutation rule are said to be noncompatible observables, by which is meant that they can both be measured simultaneously only with limited precision. See For an example, see For example, see and This \\"borrowing\\" idea has led to proposals for using the zero-point energy of vacuum as an infinite reservoir and a variety of \\"camps\\" about this interpretation.

Vijaya Narasimha - Vijaya Bhaskar combination is the greatest, legendary combination. The countless number of super-hit songs are the proof for the great talent of Vijay Narasimha. Vijaya Narasimha-Vijay Bhaskar- P.B.Srinivas-S.Janaki-P.Susheela combination created a record of hits in the Kannada Film Industry. Even today, people cherish the beauty of Vijay Narasimha's lyrics and Vijay Bhaskar's music.bPresent day musicians can no way come near the class of Vijay Narasimha & Vijay Bhaskar. Career Vijaya Narasimha's first Kannada film song was \\"Yee Dehadinda Dooranaade\\" (Oh soul, why did you depart this body) for the 1956 film Ohileshwara. He was part of the magic trio of director S. R. Puttanna Kanagal and music director Vijaya Bhaskar, which came up with matchless songs. Be it bharata bhushira mandira sundari (Upasane), panchama veda premada nada (Gejje Pooje), sandesha megha sandesha (Sharapanjara) or preethine aa dyavru tanda aasthi namma baalvege (Doorada Betta) his words stuck to the mind as much for their cadence as for their meaning. Who can forget the enchanting viraha! of yedakallu guddadamele picturised on actress Jayanthi. He worked with every major singer and music director through the 60s, 70s and 80s and with every major actor, including a couple of Kannada films with Tamil superstar rajnikanth. His last film was the Rajkumar-starrer Odahuttidavaru. He was always writing, though his eyesight was bad, it was a passion with him. According to his family, even three days before his death, he was writing devotional songs on lord rama for a cassette. Other than nearly 4,000 film songs, vijaya narasimha wrote three novels Badukina Bairagi, Srimanchakrayana and Sanjegempu and also Puttanna Kanagal's biography and lyrics for countless devotional cassettes. His cassette bhadrapada shuklada chauti sold a record number of copies 30 years ago. He also holds the unique distinction of writing Kannada song for a Tamil movie in M.G.

The series premiered on Teletoon in Canada on January 5, 2012 and ended on April 11, 2013. It aired as part of Teletoon's \\"Can't Miss Thursdays\\" block. The series was produced by Cookie Jar Entertainment.  Plot  Mudpit follows the adventures of four teens who form the eponymous band, Mudpit, as they try to earn a recording contract through competing in the Japanese massively multiplayer online role-playing game Muzika.Mudpit begins production for Teletoon Each episode in the series consists of a challenge proposed by Slime, and the band's attempts to win the challenge; during this one of the band members learns an important life lesson. Each episode concludes with an original song sung by the band members.  Characters   Main characters  * Reese (Vas Saranga) is the founder and leader of Mudpit, and the band's lead guitarist. After being expelled from his brother band Tragic Ballerina, Reese and his childhood friend Geneva enter Muzika in an attempt to win fame. While in Muzika, he is known as Dodge. * Geneva (Carleigh Beverly) is Reese's childhood friend, and the band's drummer. She is the writer of most of the band's music, and enters Muzika in order to express herself to a worldwide audience. Being Reese's close friend, she quits Tragic Ballerina as a sign of solidarity. It is hinted that she might have a small crush on Liam. While in Muzika, she is simply known as G. * Mikey (Daniel Magder) is Geneva's younger brother, and the band's bass guitarist. He is experienced at video games, and had been playing Muzika as a solo act before Reese and Geneva started to play. He enters Muzika in search of fame, and the prospects of being a ladies' man that comes with it. While in Muzika, he is known as Booch. * Liam (Jesse Rath) is the band's lead singer. Though he is a musical school prodigy, he comes from a very strict upbringing and, because of this, is socially awkward and inept at video games. However, he is caring at heart, and is supportive of his three friends. It is hinted that he may have a crush on Geneva. While in Muzika, he is known as Lamb.  Supporting characters  * Kyle (Kjartan Hewitt) is Reese's stepbrother, and was the lead singer in Tragic Ballerina before kicking Reese out of the band after he had a failed attempt at a crowd dive. With the departure of Reese and Geneva, the three remaining members reinvent themselves as the Spoilers. Reese and Kyle often have a combative relationship, with Kyle often attempting to prank or one-up his stepbrother. While in Muzika, he is known by the name Darkrider. * Fitzy (Jeff Douglas) is the owner of the \\"Game & Grub\\", a restaurant and smoothie bar in Toronto where Reese and Geneva is introduced to the world of Muzika. The restaurant also contains a number of game rooms where players may rent out in order to play Muzika. Fitzy had been part of a 90s boy band known as Barry and the Boys, and had apparently saved his money and moved on from the music world to open the Game & Grub. As such, he often acts as a mentor to Mudpit and other bands that may play Muzika there. * Slime (Robert Tinkler) is the host of Muzika, who acts as the judge in the various musical challenges that he imposes on Muzika players. As a computer character, he notably only refers to all of the human characters solely by their Muzika names. He is often harsh and condescending towards the various bands, and Mudpit in particular, he does grudgingly respect their accomplishments in the end.  Other characters  * The Ava-tarts are an all-female band centered on its lead singer, Sweetie (Meghan Heffern). They had attempted to recruit Geneva away from Mudpit to capitalize on their seemingly chauvinistic behaviour, only for Geneva to go back to Mudpit when they tried to take her identity away by forcing her to change her name to \\"S\\" and making her play the triangle, so as to not overshadow Sweetie. * Crush the Zebra are a punk rock band considered to be completely inept at video games, and is often considered to be \\"the worst band in Muzika\\". * The Prickly Pears are a country band whose band members are shaped like cacti. They eventually win the fans needed to win a road trip challenge, but are defeated in the last moment when Mudpit performs an impromptu concert in the middle of the street to win the challenge.

Background Public distrust of lawyers reached record heights in the United States after the Watergate scandal.Jerold Auerbach, Unequal Justice: Lawyers and Social Change in Modern America (New York: Oxford University Press, 1976), 301. In the aftermath of Watergate, legal self-help books became popular among those who wished to solve their legal problems without having to deal with lawyers.For examples of legal self-help books written by lawyers which concede that the profession has a bad image, see Mark H.

These contests have been common in North America since the 1930s and were used to test the relative efficiency of typing with the Dvorak and QWERTY keyboard layouts.Readings in Applied Microeconomics: The Power of the Market, Craig Newmark, p. 219 - 220 Touchscreen keyboards As of 2015, there were diverse claims regarding the fastest typing in smartphones and other touchscreen devices with on-screen keyboards. The typical yardstick is writing, with no mistakes, the 160-character text: :The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world. In reality they seldom attack a human. A disputed issue is whether auto-correct and predictive features should be allowed. Common sense indicates that they shouldn't, because when typing the record phrase several times the phone learns the text. Speed depends, then, on the phrase being repeated, a poor indicator of performance for everyday use. In the extreme, the phone could learn to predict \\"Serrasalmus\\" when typing just \\"Ser\\", but that would be extremely uncomfortable in normal circumstances (\\"ser\\" is the Spanish word for \\"being\\"). In fact, Guinness World Records establishes that \\"To qualify for the record, no autocorrect or predictive text features are allowed to remain on\\".Fastest touch-screen text message record officially broken with Fleksy keyboard In March 2010, Samsung posted a 35.54-second record with predictive texting, but no actual footage.Guinness World Record for Texting Challenge Later that year, Swype, a predictive keyboard for Android and iOS where users swipe their fingers across the keyboard to enter one word per stroke, claimed a record of 25.94 seconds, but with prediction features on.Text Message Speed Record Broken Thanks to Swype on the Samsung Galaxy S A YouTube user later claimed to have set a 21.8-second record on an iPhone, but the posted video clearly showed autocorrect enabled and correcting at least four mistakes.Text messaging world record?

In April 2014, in the midst of a publicity campaign for Windows Phone 8.1, Microsoft Research published a new record of 18.44 seconds, also with predictive features on.Microsoft Brings World’s Fastest Texting to Windows Phone 8.1 This record, obviously dependent on pre-learning by the keyboard's memory, became the object of mockery on the web.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_lXTtMa2xg It was broken the next month when a time of 18.19 seconds was alleged by Brazilian youngster Marcel Fernandes Filho using the Fleksy mobile keyboard on an Android phone.Fastest touch-screen text message record officially broken with Fleksy keyboard While the firm claimed it was without autocorrection, video footage clearly contradicted this (e.g., the letter \\"B\\" was pressed when writing \\"genera\\"); furthermore, only a portion of the complete taping was displayed. This alleged record was admitted by Guinness in spite of violating its own rules of having the autocorrect feature off. Also, a dash (crucial for the record) appeared in the main keyboard, which was never a part of Fleksy's main screen. Thus, questions arose as to whether Guinness had been object of a misinformation scheme or even a party in it.How were the Guinness People Duped? In November 2014, Fleksy claimed Mr Fernandes Filho had broken his own record on a larger phone, but later removed the video. In 2015, TipType, a What-You-Type-Is-What-You-Get keyboard with a QWERTY layout but based on sliding movements rather than pressing (similar to Swype), launched a speed contest for phones of traditional size.

The film is the third movie of a franchise that began with Armour of God (1986) and its sequel, Armour of God II: Operation Condor (1991). Released in December 2012, the film went on to gross over US$145 million at the Chinese box office. Chan also earned two Guinness World Records with the film for \\"Most Stunts Performed by a Living Actor\\" and \\"Most Credits in One Movie\\". The film won Best Action Choreography at the 32nd Hong Kong Film Awards. Summary The movie begins with the story of the Old Summer Palace and its looting and destruction by British and French soldiers in the Second Opium War. Among the treasures stolen are twelve bronze heads of the animals of the Chinese zodiac. In the present day, the bronze heads are auctioned for millions of euros each. The main company supplying the bronze heads and other stolen relics is MP Corporation. JC (Jackie Chan) is tasked by MP Corp to find the remaining lost bronze heads, with a promise of a 10x bonus if he can recover all of them. JC visits Professor Guan, who had created 12 identical replicas for study purposes with his team of researchers, under the guise of a reporter named Martin from National Geographic. When left alone, JC scans the multiple bronze Zodiac animal heads using special gloves so that his secret organisation can replicate an extremely realistic model of them. After scanning, he goes to Paris to find a woman named Coco, recommended by Guan, for more information on the whereabouts of two bronze heads. JC, along with his partners Simon (Kwon Sang-woo), David, and Bonnie, infiltrate a mansion to find two of the bronze heads. JC manages to decode the password to a top secret vault and finds two bronze heads, a painting called \\"The Roses,\\" along with many other valuable national treasures thought to be lost inside. JC's cover is soon busted but he manages to evade capture with all the valuables. However, he is spotted by Coco. Having no time to explain himself, he tells Coco to meet him at a boat house while fleeing from the mansion's security. At the boat house, Martin tells Coco that he is working for a secret corporation that is trying to recover all the lost relics for China. The guards from the mansion storm the boat house and try to attack JC. However, the police are called in and they are all arrested. JC, Coco and Simon are cleared of any wrongdoing and are released. Coco, JC and his team are invited to a castle owned by a lady named Catherine (Laura Weissbecker), unaware that the guards from the mansion are tailing them out of suspicion. It turns out that the captain of the \\"Indestructible\\", one of the ships involved in the destruction and looting of the Old Summer Palace, is Catherine's great-great-grandfather. This upsets Coco, who confronts Catherine on the issue. JC and his team find many valuable treasures in the castle, including the Bronze head of the Rooster, and hatch a series of plans to ferry them out. JC promises Catherine that he will help her locate her great-great-grandfather's remains. The next day, they venture out in search of the Indestructible's treasures, located on a seemingly uninhabited island. JC instructs Coco and Catherine to stay behind while his team explore the island. However, Coco and Catherine disobey JC's orders to look for Catherine's great-great-grandfather's corpse on their own. They get entangled among the vines, forcing JC to rescue them. While exhuming the great-great grandfather's remains, the group accidentally discovers the remains of the Indestructible, several more bronze heads and a large quantity of gold. As they prepare to leave with all the artifacts, they are confronted by the guards from the mansion. In turn, the island's local inhabitants, a group of pirates, appear and promptly capture all of them. JC and his team fight their way through to escape the island via a log set up with a pulley system, leaving the five guards with the pirates. Once on the yacht, Coco accidentally discovers the real motive of JC's ventures and confronts him. Subsequently, the log carrying approximately eight tonnes of gold sinks. Nevertheless, JC and his team still get rewarded for recovering some of the lost bronze heads. The group are enraged when they find out that the supposedly-missing Dragon bronze head was already at the hands of MP Corp all along, thereby making it impossible to claim the large bonus. Meanwhile, Coco and her fellow students' protests over the sale of the national treasures escalate quickly and capture worldwide attention. As Coco's students try to find out more about MP Corp, three of them, including Coco's younger brother, are captured. After Coco asks JC for help, JC contacts MP Corp on the availability of \\"The Roses\\" artifact and is allowed into the secret premises. Having toured the entire factory where almost exact duplicates of the relics are made to be sold as real relics in auctions, JC deduces the location of the captives. He challenges a long time rival who happens to be there as well – the unscrupulous treasure hunter, Vulture, to a fight but it ends in a stalemate. JC bargains with MP Corp to sell \\"The Roses\\" painting at a reduced price and secure the release of the three hostages. When MP Corp refuses, JC fights his way to the chamber. During the ensuing fight, a furnace explodes due to a guard's baton rupturing one of the pipes, destroying most of the facility. JC then settles for the release of the three hostages in exchange for the painting and not paying damages done to the premises. Meanwhile, the Dragon bronze head is expected to fetch the highest price in the auction but no one bids for it due to increasing pressure from activist groups. MP Corp, in a bid to teach these groups a lesson, threatens to throw the relic into an active volcano, calling the mission \\"Let the Dragon Fly,\\" if no bids are received by 12:00 noon the next day. The deadline passes without a single bid and Vulture leads a group of three sky divers to throw the relic into the volcano. JC intervenes in order to save the relic from dropping into the volcano, and is severely injured in the ensuing airborne struggle. As a mark of respect, Vulture hands over the relic to a sprawled JC. MP Corp's owners are arrested on possession of \\"The Roses\\" painting. JC is seen recovering in a hospital and on good terms with everyone, including Vulture. The movie ends with JC kissing his wife, who visits him in the hospital.  Cast  Jackie Chan with co-stars Zhang Lanxin and Helen Yao at a promotional event for CZ12. * Jackie Chan as JC a.k.a.

Certain fundamental provisions are also found in the Italian Civil Code of 1942, Arts. 2575–2583. Copyright law in Italy has not changed much since the first enactment of these provisions. There have been amendments to Law no. 633 to incorporate specific works such as computer programs and databases, or to add or alter user exceptions, but generally Italian lawmakers have been reluctant to institute any major or fundamental reforms. Italian copyright law is based strongly on authors' rights. Exceptions to authors' exclusive rights are limited — there is no provision equivalent to fair use or fair dealing — and are generally interpreted restrictively by the courts. Subject matter The subject matter owed protection is provided for (identically) in both the Civil Code (art. 2575) and Law no. 633 (Art. 1): \\"The object of the author's right is the work of intellect of creative character that belongs to the sciences, literature, music, figurative art, architecture, theatre, and cinematography, no matter the style or form of expression.\\" There is no requirement that the work be fixed in any medium to attract copyright protection. While Art. 1 requires only that the work be \\"of the intellect\\" and \\"of creative character\\", Italian courts and scholars have interpreted the provision as conditioning copyright protection on four elements: (1) a particular (not high) degree of creativity; (2) novelty; (3) the work's objectification or externalization; (4) affiliation to art or culture. Art. 2 lists non-exhaustive examples of protected subject matter (\\"In particular are protected...\\"): literary, dramatic, scientific, education, and religious works (whether in written or oral form); musical compositions with or without words; choreographic works and pantomimes; computer programs and databases. Official acts of the State are not entitled to copyright protection (Art. 5). Ownership The Civil Code states that the rights belong to the author and the author's successors, subject to special circumstances (Art. 2580). Formalities Italian law does not require any copyright formalities such as registration or deposit for copyright to subsist. The Civil Code (Art. 2576) and Law no. 633 (Art. 6) provide that the rights are first acquired upon creation of the work as a particular expression of the intellectual effort. Economic rights Exclusive economic rights in Italian copyright law are construed broadly. Art. 12 does not limit the manners in which economic rights may be exploited but provides examples. The author has the exclusive right to publish the work, and to use the work in any shape or form, original or derivative (within limits fixed by the law) and in particular certain exclusive rights such as reproduction in any manner or form by any process (Art. 13), public performance (Art. 15), and communication by wire, wireless, or Internet (Art. 16). The author also has the exclusive right to authorize renting or lending to the public (Art. 18-bis). With respect to computer programs, databases, and industrial designs that are created by an employee in the course of her duties, the employer is exclusively entitled to exercise economic rights in the work (Arts. 12-bis, 12-ter). Likewise, where a photograph is taken in the course of duties, economic rights belong to the employer, or to the person who commissioned the portrait (Art. 88). Certain categories of works are subject to special exploitation rights. For dramatico-musical works, profit is shared among authors in proportion to the deemed value of the contribution. For example, in the case of operas, the author of the music is afforded 3/4 of the total, while the author of the lyrics is afforded 1/4 (Art. 34). In a film work, the authors of the subject matter, scenario, and music, along with the artistic director, are considered joint authors. While the exploitation rights over the whole work belong to the producer, certain uses require the consent of the joint authors (Arts. 44–46). Broadcasting services may broadcast works that are performed in public places without the author's consent, but only if the work is not being performed for the first time. The author will in any case receive remuneration for these broadcasts (Arts. 52, 56, 57). Moral rights In the author-centric Italian copyright law, moral rights are eternal, non-transferable, and inalienable. The author, even after transfer of economic rights, retains the right to claim authorship and to oppose mutilation of the work or any act that would be prejudicial to her honour or reputation (Arts. 20, 22). Upon the death of the author, these rights may be relied upon by her family and descendants (Art. 23). Duration The duration of economic rights for most works and for photographs in Italian law is 70 years from the death of the author (Art. 28). Where there are multiple authors, and for cinematographic works, the economic rights expire 70 years after the death of the last surviving author (Arts. 26, 32). For works in which the economic rights are owned by government, academies, public bodies, and non-profit cultural organizations, the duration of the economic rights is 20 years from the first publication (Art. 29). Neighbouring rights Italian copyright law also provides for certain exploitation rights over non-works. Phonograph producers have the exclusive right for 50 years from fixation (and without prejudice to the author's rights) to authorize reproduction, distribution, rental, lending, and Internet availability of the sound recording (Art. 72). Broadcasters have the exclusive right for 50 years from first transmission (without prejudice to author's rights) to authorize the fixation (as well as the reproduction and distribution of fixations) and retransmission of the broadcast (Art. 79). Performers have the exclusive right for 50 years from performance to authorize the fixation of the performance (as well as the reproduction, distribution, rental, or lending of the fixation) and the broadcasting of live performances (Art. 80). The performer is also afforded moral rights in that he may oppose any communication or reproduction of his performance that might be prejudicial to his honour or reputation (Art. 81). However, the duration of this particular moral right is 50 years from the performance (Art. 85). Italian copyright law mandates that unpublished personal correspondence and memoirs may not be communicated to the public without the consent of the author and addressee (where appropriate). This right does not expire and applies even when the work itself has fallen into the public domain. Likewise, a person's portrait may not be displayed, reproduced, or commercially distributed without the consent of the subject or of his family if he has died (Art. 93). Assignments and licences Exploitation rights of the author, as well as neighbouring rights, may be acquired, sold, or transferred, if the transfer is set out in writing (Arts. 107, 110). However, publishing contracts may not set out the transfer of indeterminate future rights (Art. 119). In other words, an author cannot contract for the transfer of rights that do not yet exist in law. A further right of artists and authors is known as diritto di seguito (\\"right to follow\\"): the right to be remunerated when the first public sale of her original piece of art or manuscript exceeds the price of the first transfer. The artist is then owed a percentage of the profit made in subsequent public sales of the work (Art. 144). This right cannot be alienated, and persists for 70 years after the artist's or author's death (Arts. 147, 148). Exceptions and limitations Italian copyright law does not have an equivalent to fair use or fair dealing provisions. Limitations and exceptions are set out individually and are interpreted restrictively by the courts, as one would expect in an author's rights regime. The private copying provision was not added until 1993. Certain exceptions do not require remuneration to the author: the reproduction of current news articles or broadcasts, where the original source is indicated (Art. 65); the reproduction or communication of public speeches on matters of political or government interest (Art. 66); the use of fragments or quotations for criticism, discussion, or non-commercial teaching or research (with source indicated) (Art. 70); reproduction and communication for persons with disabilities (Art 71-bis); and the communication of low-resolution images and music over the Internet for educational or scientific purposes (Art. 70). Loans by state libraries made for cultural promotion or personal study do not require authorization or remuneration (Art. 69). Users may make reprographic reproduction of 15% of a work (excluding sheet music) for private use; remuneration is paid to the authors by the library or copy centre where the reproduction is made (Art. 68). Lawful users may also reproduce music and videos for personal, non- commercial use (Art. 71-sexies). Authors and phonograph producers are entitled to remuneration for these activities via levies on recording devices and blank media (Art. 71-septies). Where a work is protected by a technological protection measure, the rights holders are obliged to adopt proper solutions to allow the exercise of certain exceptions and limitations by lawful users on request, where the exercise would not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work or unduly prejudice the rights holder (Art. 71-quinquies). Remedies and penalties Law no. 633 provides for civil remedies such as injunction, damages (including non-pecuniary), destruction of infringing specimens, and destruction of copying equipment and devices primarily designed to circumvent technological protection measures (Arts. 156–161). A rights holder may also apply for an interim injunction for the infringement of economic rights (Art. 163). Criminal penalties for infringers include fines and imprisonment (Art. 171). If the infringement is done with gainful or commercial intent the penalties are increased (Art. 171-ter). Collective management organizations Italian copyright law allows for collective management of rights. The role of intermediary, however, is legally reserved for the Società italiana degli autori ed editori (SIAE) (Italian Society of Authors and Publishers), although membership is not mandatory (Art. 171). The SIAE is a public body that has a central role in the exercise of economic rights, being responsible for the granting of licences and authorizations, and the collection and distribution of royalties (Art. 171-ter). SIAE has a central role in rights administration, supervising public showings in cinemas, broadcasting, reproduction and distribution of audiovisual and photographic works, copy centres, and the manufacturing, import, and distribution of blank media (Art. 180). The organization also affixes its mark on media containing software, sound recordings, and moving images, that are intended to be placed on the market for sale or rent. This mark consists in a holographic sticker on which is printed the name of the author or copyright owner, a sequential ID number, and the final destination of the product (sale or rent) (Art. 181-bis).

This family originated among the Palatine Germans who immigrated to Columbia County seeking religious freedom. Descendants include John D. Rockefeller who was known to have visited the site. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. While it is now undergoing restoration as a private residence, it was originally a stage stop, tavern, and restaurant. In addition, the early settlers engaged in farming. It is a plain structure with colonnades on a double porch. It is built with fieldstone and as was typical, had a basement kitchen. The house was in poor condition and had had many unsympathetic alterations when it was bought by Mary Black and Michael J. Blackstone.

It is an example of a classical Japanese promenade garden of the Meiji Period. History Gensui Prince Yamagata Aritomo (1838-1922) was an important figure in the politics and military affairs of the Meiji Period. Born into an old samurai family and devoted to military affairs, he traveled to Europe in 1869 as part of a delegation of experts to study the Prussian Army, and when he returned he helped re-organize the Imperial Japanese Army on the Prussian model. He became Minister of War in 1873, and was twice Prime Minister of Japan, from 1889 to 1891 and from 1898 to 1900. The completion of a canal between Lake Biwa and Kyoto provided a plentiful source of water for the area around the Nanzen-ji temple domain in Kyoto.Mansfield. Page 35. Yamagata, who was a great lover of gardens, purchased land in the area and made plans to build a villa and garden using water from the canal. The then Count Yamagata (he was elevated in the Kazoku to being a Marquis in August 1895, and a Prince in September 1907) began work in 1894, but stopped in 1895 to conduct a war with China. The Marquis Yamagata, as he was by this stage, resumed work when the war was finished, with the help of the notable garden designer Ogawa Jihei (1860-1933), also known as Ueji, who had built the garden of the recreated Kyoto Imperial Palace nearby.Mansfield.

In a career that lasted from 1856 to 1858, she ran twenty times and won fourteen races. She was the leading British two-year-old of 1856, when she won eight races including the Gimcrack Stakes at York. In 1857 Blink Bonny won five of her seven races and became the second filly, after Eleanor, to defeat the colts in The Derby. In the same season, racing against her own sex, she won The Oaks, the Lancashire Oaks, and the Park Hill Stakes. Having retired from racing in 1858, Blink Bonny showed exceptional promise as a broodmare, producing three top class racehorses before her premature death in 1862. Blink Bonny was one of only six fillies to win the Derby, and has been regarded by both contemporary and modern authorities as one of the best fillies in Thoroughbred racing history. Background Blink Bonny was a powerfully-built bay filly standing 15.2½ hands high with a narrow white blaze and one white fetlock. According to some reports, she was a difficult horse who was unpopular with stable staff on account of her \\"nasty temper\\", while others described her as being \\"remarkably docile.\\" She was bred at Spring Cottage, Malton, North Yorkshire by her owner William I'Anson who also trained the filly at his Hungerford House stable. L'Anson, a Yorkshireman born at Middleham, named the filly after a turnpike-gate in Edinburgh, through which he regularly passed when traveling to England. Blink Bonny was sired by Melbourne, a useful but unexceptional racehorse who became a hugely successful stallion, described by the Farmer's Magazine as \\"far away the best\\" of his time: apart from Blink Bonny, he sired the Classic winners West Australian, Sir Tatton Sykes (2000 Guineas, St Leger), Canezou (1000 Guineas), Marchioness (Oaks), Mentmore Lass (1000 Guineas) and Cymba (Oaks). He was Champion sire in 1853 and 1857. Her dam, Queen Mary, was one of the most important broodmares of the nineteenth century. She was \\"a queer-tempered mare, very wild in the paddock, and blowing defiance to any stranger who approaches her or hers.\\" Apart from producing many good winners, her influence has continued to the present day, with her direct descendants including the 2002 European Horse of the Year Rock of Gibraltar. Racing career 1856: two-year-old season As a two-year-old, I'Anson ran Blink Bonny eleven times. She made her first appearance at York on 22 April when she finished third in the Zetland Stakes and she was third again in the Mostyn Stakes at Chester in May. Two weeks later she recorded her first win in the Sapling Stakes at Manchester. Blink Bonny then won her next four races, taking the Bishop Burton Stakes at Beverley, the Tyro Stakes at Newcastle, the Great Lancashire Produce Stakes at Liverpool and the Bentinck Memorial Stakes at Goodwood. She was sent to York in August where she was beaten by Lady Hawthorn in the Convivial Stakes, but won the Gimcrack Stakes two days later, beating the good colts M. D. and Skirmisher. She ran twice at the St Leger meeting at Doncaster in September, winning the Filly Stakes and a Sweepstakes in which she gave four pounds to colts including Adamas and Skirmisher. Blink Bonny earned a total of £2,201 during her first season. I'Anson turned down several offers for the filly, who went into the winter break as the favourite for the following year's Derby. 1857: three-year-old season During the winter of 1856-57, Blink Bonny developed severe problems with her teeth (\\"dentition fever\\") which left her unable to eat normally. Stable staff had to hand-feed the filly on clover and other green stuff but she lost a great deal of weight before she recovered. Her status as favourite for the Derby made her a potential target for gamblers and bookmakers who stood to lose money if she were to succeed, and I'Anson reportedly purchased a ferocious bloodhound to patrol and guard the stables. As a result of the filly's problems, I'Anson was unable to train her as thoroughly as he would have wished, but nevertheless entered her for the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket, believing that she could win without being fully fit. She started favourite, at odds of 4/5 in a field of eight fillies. Blink Bonny tracked the leaders in the early stages, but two furlongs from the finish she began to show \\"symptoms of defeat\\" and faded to finish fifth behind Imperieuse. Blink Bonny in the paddock at Epsom Blink Bonny's defeat at Newmarket led to a loss in public confidence, and at Epsom on 1 June she started at odds of 20/1 in a field of thirty for the Derby. After a number of false starts, the race got under way and Blink Bonny, ridden by John \\"Jack\\" Charlton, was among the leading group from the start and was one of nine horses disputing the lead early in the straight. The filly hit the front a furlong out and prevailed by a neck from the 200/1 outsider Black Tommy in a \\"blanket finish\\", with the first six horses crossing the line in a group. The winning time of 2:45.0 broke the race record by three seconds. Her victory was met with surprise and disappointment by the professional gamblers, many of whom had lost heavily on the result. Two days after winning the Derby, Blink Bonny reappeared in the Oaks, for which she started the 4/5 favourite against twelve other fillies including Imperieuse. She was towards the rear in the early stages but moved up to take the lead two furlongs from the finish and won, according to the Sporting Review, with \\"ridiculous ease\\" by at least eight lengths from Sneeze, with the other runners, including Imperieuse, finishing \\"at long intervals.\\" Following her double at Epsom, Blink Bonny walked over to win a sweepstakes at Royal Ascot on Gold Cup day in June, when no other horses opposed her. On 15 July she started at odds of 1/5 for the Lancashire Oaks at Liverpool and won easily, giving weight to her three opponents. She also won another Bentinck Memorial Stakes at Goodwood later in July, beating her only rival, the colt Chevalier d'Industrie, by twenty lengths. In September, Blink Bonny attempted to win her third classic when she was sent to Doncaster in for the St Leger. Blink Bonny's presence was credited for attracting an enormous number of people, including the writers Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins, to Doncaster, all of them reportedly anxious to see \\"so extraordinary an animal.\\" She started 5/4 favourite but after leading briefly in the straight she finished only fourth of the eleven runners behind Imperieuse, having been given a poor ride by Charlton. It was widely believed that Charlton had deliberately \\"pulled\\" the filly (prevented her from winning) on the orders of the bookmaker John Jackson. The ill-feeling came to a head when Blink Bonny, carrying a ten pounds higher weight, ran in the Park Hill Stakes a day later over the same course and distance. She won easily by six lengths in a time that was two seconds faster than that set by Imperieuse in winning the St Leger. The crowd, believing that the result proved that Blink Bonny had been pulled in the classic attacked the horse's connections. Only the intervention of the former prize-fighters John Gully and Tom Sayers. prevented \\"Little Jack\\" Charlton from being \\"torn to pieces\\" by angry spectators. An estimated two thousand people became involved in the disturbances and Blink Bonny herself had to be escorted from the scene by an impromptu bodyguard formed by former police officers. The incident came to be known as the \\"Blink Bonny riot\\". 1858: four-year-old season Blink Bonny's first run as a four-year-old in the Bentinck Memorial at Goodwood was much-anticipated, but she looked unimpressive before the start and ran so poorly in the race that she was pulled up shortly after half way. Rumours that she had died of \\"inflammation of the lungs\\", which appeared in some newspapers after a report in the Edinburgh Courant proved to be incorrect and she was retired to stud in good health. Assessment In May 1886 The Sporting Times carried out a poll of one hundred racing experts to create a ranking of the best British racehorses of the 19th century. Blink Bonny was ranked twenty- second, having been placed in the top ten by twelve of the contributors. She was rated the fourth best filly, behind Virago, Plaisanterie and Crucifix. Blink Bonny has been described by Thoroughbred Heritage as \\"one of the greatest 3-year-old fillies of all time.\\" The Irish Metropolitan Magazine called her \\"the most wonderful filly ever seen on our turf.\\" Stud career Blink Bonny was retired to her owner's stud where she produced only three foals, all of whom showed top class form. Her first foal, Borealis, a filly by Newminster, finished third in the Oaks. She went on to become an important broodmare, being the direct female ancestor of Bayardo and Lemberg. Blink Bonny's second foal, Blair Athol, was one of the outstanding racehorses of his era, winning the Derby and the St Leger in 1864. Her third and final foal, Breadalbane, by Stockwell, won the Prince of Wales's Stakes and finished third in the Ascot Gold Cup. Blink Bonny died as an eight-year-old in 1862, shortly after giving birth to Breadalbane, who was raised by a foster-mare. Her jockey, John Charlton, died of consumption a few months after Blink Bonny on 31 July. I'Anson donated her skeleton to York Museum where it was mounted and displayed. Two of her hooves are displayed in a glass cabinet at the Blink Bonny pub at Christon Bank, near Embleton, Northumberland. Pedigree As a museum object After her death, Blink Bonny's skeleton was donated to the Yorkshire Museum and was on display until the 1950s. She was on display with the skeleton of another racehorse – Tracery. In 1979 it was reported that one of these skeletons was reburied in an 'archaeological trench' by then Keeper of the museum George Willmot and the location of the other was a mystery.

In 2003 the book was published in an English translation by Anthea Bell, to which the shorter essays on Améry and Weiss were added. Reception John Banville reviewed the book for The Guardian: \\"On the Natural History of Destruction is a quietly spoken but fierce protest at the mendacity and moral evasiveness of our time. In the tragic absence of more Sebald fiction, it will have to do. One can do no better than to say of Sebald's work what he himself quotes Elias Canetti saying of the diary, 'notable for precision and responsibility', of a survivor of Hiroshima: 'If there were any point in wondering what form of literature is essential to a thinking, seeing human being today, then it is this.'\\" Kenneth Baker of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: \\"Sebald's matter- of-fact evocation of the wartime events on which his collection turns make sickening reading. He relies on the written recollections of a few contemporary witnesses, notably Hans Erich Nossack and Alexander Kluge but offers long descriptions of the terrible events in his own even voice.\\" Baker ended the review: \\"On the Natural History of Destruction leaves an aftertaste of sadness that flows from both its own bleak reflections and the knowledge that Sebald's indispensable voice has been silenced.\\" See also * 1999 in literature * German literature References Category:1999 non-fiction books Category:German essay collections Category:Works by W.

Located at the north end of the town of Masnières, France, the memorial commemorates the participation of the Newfoundlanders in the taking and defense of the town during the First Battle of Cambrai between 20 November and 2 December 1917. The battle In November 1917 the Royal Newfoundland Regiment was one of four battalions of the 88th Brigade, British 29th Division, Third Army which would participate in the First Battle of Cambrai under the overall command of General Julian Byng. Battle lines showing the progressions of the Battle of Cambrai. Masnières is in the upper centre of the right side of the map. On the opening day of the battle, 20 November, the Royal Newfoundland Regiment (along with the rest of the 29th Division) were initially held in reserve as reinforcements. Without a preparatory artillery barrage and led by tanks, the initial surprise attack struck the heavily fortified Hindenburg Line and Hindenburg Support Line and saw positive results, opening significant holes in the German defensive lines. The 29th division was then sent in to 'mop up' pockets of German resistance. When sent in, the 29th Division's objective was to consolidate bridgeheads over the St. Quentin Canal with the Newfoundland Regiment and the 88th Brigade's thrust to solidify the capture of a strategic section of the St. Quentin Canal and the town of Masnières. The town was a strategic strong-point that protected several crossings over the canal that needed to be captured to give the British cavalry a crossing en route to their objective, the city of Cambrai in a subsequent phase of the battle. By the end of day on the 20th, the Newfoundlanders had fought their way into the outskirts of Masnières and the following day cleared the last defenders and consolidated hold on the town. However, the British advance had created a precarious bulge of the lines into German-held territory about 6.5 kilometres (4 miles) deep and 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) wide which was surrounded on three sides by the enemy. Ten days after the initial attack, on 30 November, the Germans appeared to have identified this vulnerability and launched an attack against the right flank of the salient to the south of Masnières, squarely onto the Newfoundlanders and 88th Brigade. The enemy's thrust into the British lines threatened cut off the salient and to encircle the Third Army troops within, but the four Battalions of the 88th Brigade counter-attacked and pushed the enemy back 1500 metres. The fight was costly, as the commanding officer of the Newfoundland Battalion recorded: \\"Our strength in the morning, 9 officers, 360 other ranks; at night, 8 officers, 230 other ranks.\\" in his diary that night. Having withstood the shock of the initial attack, the Newfoundlanders continued to hold their positions for another day while commanders came to understand the vulnerability of the salient was untenable and on 4 December a fighting withdrawal to the original German second line of defense, the Hindenburg Support System was organized by Byng. Combined with their earlier service in the war at Beaumont-Hamel, Gueudecourt, in the Third Battle of Ypres and once again at Masnières, the grit and resilience shown by the 'Blue Puttees'Due to a lack of regulation khaki coloured material available in the haste to get the Battalion into the field, the Newfoundlanders substituted navy blue material for its 'puttee' calf-wrap, and maintained the practice throughout the war had led to the Regiment coming to be very well regarded as a fighting force. In fact, a little more than a month after Cambrai, on 25 January 1918, His Majesty King George V conferred the title of \\"Royal\\" onto the regiment in recognition for its service. This proved to be a distinction that was awarded to no other regiment of the British Army while fighting was still in progress during the First World War. Memorial The memorial is one of five erected in Europe by the Newfoundland government following the First World War. Four were erected in France at Beaumont-Hamel, Gueudecourt, Masnières and Monchy-le-Preux and the fifth is at Courtrai/Kortrijk in Belgium. A sixth monument, a gift from Major William Howe Greene, OBE, who served with the Newfoundlanders during the war stands in Bowring Park in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada. The memorials feature are all centrally identical, featuring the emblem of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, the caribou, cast in bronze, as designed by British sculptor Basil Gotto. The caribou, standing atop a cairn of Newfoundland granite, appears to roar in the direction of the enemy the Newfoundlanders faced during the battle. The Masnières Memorial is situated on the west side of the D644 road, at the north end of the village of Masnières. The Caribou is surrounded by a small park, roughly in the shape of a parallelogram. The Monument itself is situated in the centre of the park; at the cairn's base is a circular garden and, surrounding that, is a level lawn of grass with several maple trees at points around the three sides away from the road.

Life  From 1974 to 1978, Reinhold studied at the University of Applied Arts Vienna under Herbert Tasquil. During his university studies, Reinhold concentrated on poetic-magical paintings and photographs, dealing with the objecthood of the image.Wilfried Skreiner, \\"Behauptungen zur Neuen Malerei in Österreich“ in \\"Sinnpause“, Kunstforum Cologne, Bd 80, 3/1985. In the late 1970s, Reinhold was one of the initiators of so-called “New Painting” (in German Junge Wilde) together with Siegfried Anzinger, Erwin Bohatsch, Alfred Klinkan and Hubert Schmalix.Robert Fleck, exhibition catalogue „Malermacht; Expression und Pathos in der neuen Österreichischen Malerei“, Künstlerhaus Palais Thurn und Taxis Bregenz, 1988. In the mid-1980s, Reinhold has begun to focus on issues of medium reflexivity of painting and photography,Carl Aigner/Thomas Reinhold, \\"Zur Ikonographie von Zeit und Raum\\", talk in EIKON - Internationale Zeitschrift für Photographie und Medienkunst, Nr. 60/2007. which has been dominating his work until today. Reinhold lives in Vienna.  Work  ;Painting From the photo series “Brushstrokes of Light, living Shades”, 2010 Reinhold’s large-scale oil paintings address such issues as medium reflexivity, the material dimension of paint, or the canvas plane and its relation to space. The paintings deal with questions of their own creation and their relation to time by showing overlapping layers of colour.Matthias Boeckl, \\"Zeitlose Sinnlichkeit\\", art magazine Parnass Vienna, Nr. 3/2009. Because of this, the beholder needs to see the paintings in an almost archaeological way to explore the pictorial space. In 2011, Reinhold worked on the series “Tectonics of Poise“. The subject of this group of works reflects on their own creation. Liquid paint coalesces around a dead centre, permitting – for a few moments – a process of ordered decision making. The painting procedure, in which the allocation of the centre of gravity is such an essential element, actually provokes this fleeting state where indeterminacy gives way to form. It is this point of transition that attracts attention and produces shapes seemingly suspended between rivulets. ;Photography Since the beginning of his career, Reinhold has been interested in photography. In his 1977 “Ferris wheel series” he addresses issues of space, time and chronology. The series’ central motif, the “Wiener Riesenrad” (Viennese Ferris wheel) stands for questions of mobility and immobility, object and its image.Carl Aigner/Thomas Reinhold, \\"Zur Ikonographie von Zeit und Raum\\", talk in EIKON - Internationale Zeitschrift für Photographie und Medienkunst, Nr. 60/2007. In 2010, Reinhold lived in Shanghai for three months, where worked on the series “Brushstrokes of Light, Living Shades”. The photographs for this series were taken by night, and the resulting images recall the superimposition techniques employed in Reinhold‘s paintings. The paintings in the series are ink paintings made with a Chinese calligraphy brush, which remind the beholder of the early days of photography. Both the motifs and the technique are linked to the city Shanghai. Four side windows of the Chapel of the Resurrection, 2002 ;Public Work In 1999, Reinhold got the assignment of designing the windows of the Chapel of the Resurrection, Rue van Maerlant in Brussels, which he completed in 2002 in cooperation with the glass painting manufactory Schlierbach, Austria.Pia Jardí, \\"Licht als Thema und malerisches Element\\", Thomas Reinholds Intervention an den fünf Fenstern der \\"Chapel of the Resurrection\\" in Brüssel - Art magazine Parnass Vienna, Nr. 1/2003. As a result of the fusion technique used in the windows' production, their transparency provides a 'display model' of visual depth, the superimposition of different layers, and the relationship between coexistence and sequence. This allows the viewer to reflect on his or her own position. Looking out, the transitional coloured layer merges with the facades of the European government buildings opposite, while trees, an expanse of lawn, passing cars and people contribute their shapes and colours to a background layer of reality and add to the view as a whole.

Its discovery was announced in 2012 by a German and Malagasy research team. The Sahafina Forest had not been studied until 2008 and 2009, when Groupe d'Étude et de Recherche sur les Primates de Madagascar (GERP)—a Malagasy-based research and conservation group for which the lemur is named—inventoried the forest's lemurs. Based on genetic studies, measurements, and photos, the research team confirmed the Gerp's mouse lemur was an undescribed species, distinct from Goodman's mouse lemur, which is found away. Gerp's mouse lemur is significantly larger, weighing on average , compared to Goodman's mouse lemur, which weighs about . Jolly's mouse lemur, which is its closest relative and a neighbor to the south, is comparably larger, but differs in tail length and genetics. Because it is a recently discovered species, little is known about its behavior, communication, ecology, or reproduction. The species appears to be restricted to a small region of lowland evergreen rain forest, and is seriously threatened by forest loss.  Evolutionary and taxonomic history  The first recorded specimen (shown here) was captured, recorded, and released on 25 June 2009. Gerp's mouse lemur was discovered by German and Malagasy members of the Malagasy organization Groupe d'Étude et de Recherche sur les Primates de Madagascar (GERP) in a previously unstudied lowland forest known as the Sahafina Forest in eastern Madagascar, near Mantadia National Park. The first recorded specimen (holotype) of the species was captured on 25 June 2009, and was released after genetic samples, measurements, and photographs were taken. At the time, it was not recognized as a distinct species of mouse lemur. Two other paratypes were also measured and recorded, but no physical specimen was obtained by the publication of the initial study. The discovery was published in the journal Primates in 2012. The species was named after the research and conservation team that described it. Gerp's mouse lemur differed genetically and physically from all of its nearest neighboring mouse lemur species. Its tail is longer than its closest relative, Jolly's mouse lemur (M. jollyae), which lives further south and whose tail is 18% shorter. It also has a higher body mass () and is generally larger than Goodman's mouse lemur (M. lehilahytsara), which weighs about . Gerp's mouse lemur exhibits significant genetic differences from its northern neighbor, Simmons' mouse lemur (M. simmonsi). The genetics tests initially conducted focused on three different loci of mitochondrial DNA: a partial D-loop region, MT-CYB, and COII. D-loop analysis suggested Jolly's mouse lemur was Gerp's mouse lemur's closest relative (forming a sister group). All three tests showed the mouse lemurs sampled from Sahafina formed a monophyletic clade (an exclusive family group) and the species was sufficiently distinct from other mouse lemurs. The authors concluded both the molecular and morphological differences supported the declaration of a new species based on the phylogenetic species concept and a more conservative \\"integrative taxonomic approach\\".  Anatomy and physiology  Among mouse lemurs, Gerp's mouse lemur is larger-bodied and has a long tail, which can be used to store fat. The fur is darker on its back, which is brownish-gray with a broad reddish line down the middle, compared to the front, which varies from a light gray to creamy white and extends from the throat to the genitals. The outer arms and legs contrast the rest of the body with their darker color, and the fingers have sparse, whitish-gray fur. The head is reddish in color, with darker brown surrounding the eyes and a noticeable white stripe across the nose and between the eyes. Its ears are prominent, yet small, with dark brown edges. The tail is covered in dense, long, brownish-gray fur. The undercoat is short and dense, while the guard hairs are sparser. The skin visible on the hands and feet is colored pinkish-brown. Gerp's mouse lemur weighs around and has a tail length of approximately . It is a large-bodied mouse lemur, and belongs to a group of large mouse lemurs (weighing more than ), including four eastern species—Simmons' mouse lemur, Jolly's mouse lemur, the northern rufous mouse lemur (M. tavaratra), and MacArthur's mouse lemur (M. macarthurii)—as well as six species of western mouse lemur: Claire's mouse lemur (M. mamiratra), Danfoss' mouse lemur (M. danfossi), the Bongolava mouse lemur (M. bongolavensis), the golden-brown mouse lemur (M. ravelobensis), the gray mouse lemur (M. murinus), and the reddish-gray mouse lemur (M. griseorufus). Most of these larger mouse lemur species have a long tail, as does Gerp's mouse lemur, with the exception of Jolly's mouse lemur and the gray mouse lemur. Its ears are small (measuring ), which conforms with that of other rainforest mouse lemur species, in contrast to larger-eared mouse lemurs of the dry, western forests (averaging ). As with all mouse lemurs, no body mass differences could be discerned between the sexes. However, larger samples are needed to confirm this.  Behavior  No data are available concerning the behavior, communication, ecology, or reproduction of the Gerp's mouse lemur, although such data may help support its species status.  Distribution and habitat  Gerp's mouse lemur has only been identified in the Sahafina Forest in eastern Madagascar, about east of Mantadia National Park, south of the city of Toamasina, and from the Indian Ocean. The forest fragment is about and is surrounded by secondary forest growing in areas previously cut for rice cultivation (known locally as savoka). The Sahafina Forest ranges from above sea level, whereas nearby Mantadia National Park, home of its closest neighboring mouse lemur population (Goodman's mouse lemur), ranges from above sea level. No major rivers separate these highland and lowland forests and their respective mouse lemur populations. The initial study did not conclude whether the large Rianila River or one of the smaller rivers—the Ivonoro and Onibe—further north acts as a species boundary between Gerp's mouse lemur and Simmons' mouse lemur (M. simmonsi) to the north. Approximately the south lies the Mangoro River, a very large river that acts as a biogeographic barrier for many species. In 2010, a genetically distinct form of mouse lemur was sequenced from Marolambo, south of the river. The geographic range of Gerp's mouse lemur is unlikely to extend south of this river, but more studies are needed to confirm this. In total, the area between the rivers to the north and south, the highlands to the west, and the ocean to the east is no larger than (smaller than the island of Puerto Rico) and this is the likely extent of its geographic range.  Conservation status  There are no protected areas within the known geographic range of Gerp's mouse lemur. Because it lives in lowland forests, which are more likely to be converted into agricultural land relative to highland rainforests, it faces an elevated conservation risk. Of the of its potential geographic range, only very small parts remain forested.

Life Born at Howden, Yorkshire, on 30 August 1767, he was the son of James Savage, a bell and clock maker. When about sixteen years old he became a contributor to the journals published in the neighbourhood of Howden, and in 1790 he began business there with his brother, William Savage, as printer and bookseller. In 1797 William Savage moved to London, and in 1803 James Savage followed him, at first employed in the publishing business of Sir Richard Phillips, and later by the firms of Joseph Mawman and William Sherwood. When the London Institution was founded in 1806 in the Old Jewry, Savage was appointed assistant librarian under Richard Porson, and he rescued Porson from the workhouse in St Martin's Lane on 20 September 1808, after a seizure not long before Porson's death. After 1820 Savage spent some time in Taunton, first as manager of an unsuccessful Tory newspaper, then as a bookseller, and finally as librarian of the Somerset and Taunton Institution. His next move was to Dorchester, where he edited for fourteen years the Dorset County Chronicle and Somersetshire Gazette. He returned to Taunton, and died there on 19 March 1845. Works In London Savage contributed to the Monthly Magazine and the Universal Magazine. He wrote: * ‘History of Howden Church’ [anon.], 1799. * ‘History of the Castle and Parish of Wressle in the East Riding of Yorkshire,’ 1805. * ‘The Librarian,’ 1808–9; three volumes and one number (48 pp.) of the fourth volume. An ‘Account of the Last Illness of Richard Porson’ is in vol. i. pp. 274–81. It was also printed separately in an edition of seventy-five copies, and is embodied in John Selby Watson's Life of Porson, pp. 318–32. * ‘An Account of the London Daily Newspapers,’ 1811; describes their circulation and opinions at that date. * ‘Observations on the Varieties of Architecture,’ 1812. * ‘Memorabilia, or Recollections Historical, Biographical, and Antiquarian,’ 1820. * ‘A History of the Hundred of Carhampton, Somerset,’ 1830. * ‘Dorchester and its Environs,’ 1832, reissued in 1833. He edited Concise History of the Present State of Commerce of Great Britain, translated [by J. W. H.] from the German of Charles Reinhard, 1805, and Joshua Toulmin's History of Taunton, 1822. He projected works on Somerset which did not appear; the manuscripts which he collected for them were in the collections of Sir Thomas Phillipps, which were sold in June 1896.

Known as a nostalgic, catastrophic author, he was also the leader of the literary avant-garde and bohemians in Lublin.Pietrasiewicz, Tomasz and Aleksandra Zińczuk. \\"Józef Czechowicz\\", Lublin. Pamięć Miejsca. For this visionary poet, verse seemed to be a question of imagination; he would play with word consonances, dreamlike associations, musicality, and create picturesque visions.Kowalczykowa, Alina (2004). \\"The Interwar Years  1918-1939\\" in: Ten Centuries of Polish Literature, p. 222-23. Wydawnictwo IBL PAN, Warszawa. . Czechowicz used to live and create in Lublin; he also died there tragically, a few days after World War II had started. Life Józef Czechowicz came from a poor family living in Lublin. He was born in a basement flat, which has not survived to these days, in Kapucyńska 3 Street. His father, Paweł Czechowicz, worked as a janitor and, later, as a meter leader in the Warsaw Bank in Lublin. In 1912, he died due to a severe mental disease. Józef Czechowicz's mother, Małgorzata, née Sułek, was a good-natured person of a tiny posture. 10 years older than her husband, she died in 1936.Tomaszewski, Feliks. \\"Józef Czechowicz\\", Virtual Library of Polish Literature. The poet dedicated to her many of his poems. Apart from Józef, Paweł and Małgorzata had three children, Janek, Katarzyna and Stanisław. In 1913 Czechowicz went to a Russian primary school in Lublin and graduated from the First Seven-Form City School in 1917. During the Polish-Soviet War, in 1920, he volunteered to join the Polish army but later came back home to continue his education. The poet attended the Teacher’s College, the Higher Teacher’s Course in Lublin and completed his education in 1929, graduating from the Institute of Special Pedagogy in Warsaw. At first, he worked as a teacher in Brasława, Słobódka and Volodymyr-Volynskyi; he also taught in a special school in Lublin, whose manager he eventually became. While his first volume of verse, kamień (stone) was printed in 1927, it is considered that he officially made his debut, publishing in the first issue of Reflektor \\"Opowieść o papierowej koronie\\" (A Story of a Paper Crown), poetic prose whose protagonist is Henryk, a disappointed homosexual lover who has attempted suicide. 1931 sketch of Józef Czechowicz by Roman Kramsztyk Józef Czechowicz was a homosexual. His sexual orientation significantly influenced his writingKaliściak, Tomasz. (2011). Katastrofy odmieńców, p. 340-41. Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Śląskiego, Katowice. . but it also brought down repression on him. He also worked as a journalist and an editor of newspapers and magazines based in Lublin. He followed this occupation after he moved to Warsaw in 1933. He belonged to Polish Teachers' Union and supported many of his writing friends, with both finances and publishing. He would take care of a group of poets who used to live at Dobra 9 St: Henryk Domiński, Wacław Mrozowski and Bronisław Ludwik Michalski. While he was living in Warsaw, he developed friendships with poets such as Czesław Miłosz and Anna Świrszczyńska. Death As Alina Kowalczykowa indicates, in the poetry volume nuta człowiecza Czechowicz envisioned himself being struck by a bomb. Having heard about the outbreak of World War II, Czechowicz left Warsaw and came back to Lublin. He was convinced that being outside the capital city would make him safe. On 9 September 1939 between 9 and 10 a.m. he was at the barber's at Krakowskie Przedmieście 46 St. He died when the building was bombarded. Poetry In his approach to rhyme and metrics, Czechowicz was unorthodox. However, as Czesław Miłosz cogently points out, \\"all of his poetry is intrisically linked to the so-called 'bourgeois lyricism' of the seventeenth century and to folk songs.\\"Miłosz, Czesław (1983). The History of Polish Literature, p. 411-12. University of California Press, California. . He emphasised the striking harmonious musicality in his poetry by using onomatopoeia, phonetic instrumentation, and sonorous neologisms as well as selecting originally harmonious rare assonances and rhymes. Czechowicz is often described as a poet of the city, of small towns and provinces. The supernatural character of the worlds presented in his poetry is intensified by the use of personifications, including nature and landscape elements. His rejection of capital letters and punctuation also increases the atmosphere of mystery and ambiguity, typical in his works. Czesław Miłosz notes that the very voice of this poet, hardly audible and murmuring, cannot be compared to any kind of Western poetry, and it appears to be untranslatable due to exploiting the concealed sonorities characteristic only to this one language. Still, some analogies can be suggested: \\"His lyrics can be likened to chamber music made poignant by the counterpoint of dark philosophical and metaphysical problems.\\" Józef Czechowicz Literary Museum in Lublin Józef Czechowicz Literary Museum in Lublin, Złota Street Józef Czechowicz Literary Museum in Lublin is actually a department of the Lublin Province Museum. The main goal of the museum is to collect and share manuscripts and publications by or about Czechowicz, though not exclusively (other writers from the Lublin region are included).

He was the third child and first son of the couple and died in infancy. Birth Ivan became Grand Prince of Moscow at the age of three, in 1533. At his coronation, on 16 January 1547, the sixteen-year-old Ivan resurrected the title of Tsar, occasionally used by his grandfather and namesake, Ivan III of Moscow. Holding all of the power in his empire, he could choose his bride. He eventually picked Anastasia Romanovna, the daughter of a wealthy boyar. Throughout the first four years of their marriage, Anastasia presented Ivan with two daughters, Anna and Maria. Both died in infancy, Anna at the age of eleven months and Maria before her sixth month. However, on 11 October 1552, Anastasia gave birth to a son, whom they named Dmitri, presumably after ancestor Dmitri Donskoy. During a severe illness, Ivan asked the boyars to take an oath, making his infant son his heir apparent and the first Tsesarevich. However, the boyars were not very happy about this, as they wanted to see Ivan's cousin, Vladimir of Staritsa, succeed but they reluctantly accepted. Historians cannot agree whether this episode occurred in 1552 or 1553. Death In the summer of 1553, Ivan proposed a pilgrimage to Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery, near the present-day village of Kirillov. While on the Sora River, the royal boat was hit by a wave, it overturned and the Tsesarevich was dropped by his wet nurse. The adults managed to escape, but by the time they got to the baby, Dmitri had drowned. \\"The Chronicle\\" records that Maximus the Greek, who had recently visited Ivan, foresaw the death of the Tsesarevich. According to Andrey Kurbsky, Maximus had told Ivan that \\"he should not go such a long way with his wife and newborn lad\\". Aftermath Dmitri was interred in the Archangel Cathedral. After his death, Anastasia would have three more children, two of whom would survive infancy. Ivan's youngest son by his last wife was named Dmitry after his eldest son who had died more than thirty years before.

It was written by co-creator Mark Gatiss, who also portrays Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's brother in the series, and was directed by Paul McGuigan. The episode is a contemporary adaptation of The Hound of the Baskervilles, one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous works. In the episode, Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his crime-solving partner John Watson (Martin Freeman) take on the case of Henry Knight (Russell Tovey), who 20 years earlier witnessed the brutal killing of his father by a \\"gigantic hound\\" on Dartmoor. The investigation leads the pair to Baskerville, a military research base. In the conclusion it is revealed that the hounds were images induced by a mind- altering drug, a chemical weapon whose creator was in fact the real murderer of Henry's father. Because of the popularity of the novel, Gatiss felt a greater responsibility to include familiar elements of the story than he did when adapting the lesser-known stories. The script was intended to follow elements of the horror genre and make the episode scary. As opposed to traditional ghost stories, Gatiss's plot focused on more contemporary horrors, conspiracy theories and genetic modification. Filming was done throughout May 2011, with additional shots taking place as late as August. Location shooting took place mostly across South Wales, though parts were shot in Dartmoor. The hound was created using visual effects. After its broadcast on BBC One, the episode received consolidated figures of 10.266 million viewers in the United Kingdom. This rating, although a slight drop from the previous episode, still represented the second largest audience in British television the week it aired. Critical reaction toward the episode was largely positive, with reviewers praising both the modernisation and its tonal fidelity to the original. Critics praised Cumberbatch, Freeman, and Tovey, as well as Sherlock's \\"mind palace\\" sequence. Plot Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) and John (Martin Freeman) receive a visit from Henry Knight (Russell Tovey), who witnessed his father's death by a \\"gigantic hound\\" at Dartmoor 20 years ago. After years of therapy, Henry visited the site again, only to see the hound again, prompting his request for help. Though initially dismissive, Sherlock is soon interested by Henry's use of \\"hound\\" instead of \\"dog\\". Sherlock and John arrive in Dartmoor to find the hound is a local legend. They visit Baskerville, a nearby Ministry of Defence research base, using Mycroft's (Mark Gatiss) security pass. After Mycroft's credentials cause a security alert, Dr. Bob Frankland (Clive Mantle) vouches for Sherlock's identity, despite knowing the truth. Frankland says he was a friend of Henry's father and is concerned for Henry's well-being. Henry tells John and Sherlock about the words \\"Liberty\\" and \\"In\\" in his dreams. Sherlock, John, and Henry then visit the hollow in the hope of finding the hound. On the way, John notices what seems to be Morse code signals (these were unrelated; they were headlight flashes from a group of doggers). When Sherlock and Henry arrive at the hollow, they both see the hound. At a local inn, Sherlock is visibly shaken and confesses he saw the hound. John tries calming him, suggesting he is imagining things. Sherlock reacts with anger, denying there is something wrong with him. John tries to interview Henry's therapist, Louise Mortimer (Sasha Behar). However, they are interrupted by Frankland, who blows his cover. Meanwhile, Henry hallucinates the hound is stalking his home. The next morning Sherlock realises \\"hound\\" may be an acronym rather than a word. The pair run into DI Lestrade (Rupert Graves) who was sent by Mycroft to keep an eye on Sherlock. They interrogate the innkeepers about a past order for meat that John has spotted, which struck him as odd for a vegetarian restaurant. The innkeepers kept a dog on the moor to boost the tourist trade, but assure the investigators they had put it down. This explanation satisfies Lestrade but not Sherlock, who insists the dog he saw was monstrous. Calling Mycroft, Sherlock gains access to Baskerville again. Searching the lower levels of the genetics labs, John finds himself trapped and then hears growling which he assumes is the hound. Locking himself in an empty cage, he calls Sherlock, who rescues him. Sherlock deduces a chemical weapon designed to trigger violent hallucinations was responsible. Retreating into his \\"mind palace\\", a memory technique, Sherlock realises \\"Liberty\\" and \\"In\\" stands for Liberty, Indiana. After viewing confidential files, he sees \\"H.O.U.N.D.\\" was a secret C.I.A. project aimed at creating a hallucinatory anti-personnel chemical weapon, but the project was abandoned several years before. Sherlock realises Frankland, who participated in the project, has continued it in secret. After John receives a call from Mortimer that Henry has run off with a gun, John, Sherlock and Lestrade run to the hollow to find Henry about to commit suicide. Sherlock explains the hound was an hallucination; his father was actually killed by Frankland, who was wearing a gas mask and a sweatshirt with \\"H.O.U.N.D. Liberty, In\\" on it; a child could not cope with this, so his mind tricked him. Every time Henry came back, Frankland gassed him with the hallucinogen; the chemical agent is the fog they encountered at the hollow, triggered by pressure pads in the area. As Henry calms down, they all see the innkeepers' dog, also affected by the gas; John shoots it. Sherlock finds and catches Frankland at the scene. Henry realises that Frankland murdered Henry's father, because he found him testing the drug. Frankland flees into the base's minefield and gets blown up. As Sherlock and John prepare to leave the next morning, John wonders why he saw the hound in the lab despite not having inhaled the gas from the hollow. Sherlock surmises that John was poisoned by the leaking pipes in the laboratory, and John realises Sherlock locked him in the labs in order to test his theory. He also points out Sherlock was wrong for once; he believed the drug was in Henry's sugar and put it in John's coffee. In the closing scenes, Mycroft oversees the release of Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) from a holding cell in which he has written Sherlock's name all over the walls. Sources and allusions The story is based on Arthur Conan Doyle's novel The Hound of the Baskervilles, and also contains plot devices and lines from other Doyle stories: *The hallucinogenic gas comes from \\"The Adventure of the Devil's Foot\\". *Holmes' bloodsoaked appearance with a harpoon comes from \\"The Adventure of Black Peter\\". *Holmes' stated preference for something stronger than tea, perhaps \\"seven percent stronger\\", is a reference to his use of a seven percent cocaine solution described in The Sign of the Four. *The scene wherein Holmes claims to have made a bet with Watson comes from a similar scene in \\"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle.\\" The episode also introduces the popular catchphrase, \\"Once you've ruled out the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be true\\", from several stories. *Sherlock calls Lestrade \\"brown as a nut\\", a phrase taken word-for- word from a different conversation in A Study in Scarlet. Production Casting Russell Tovey appeared in the episode as Henry Knight. In June 2011, it was announced that Russell Tovey would appear in Sherlock series two in its second episode. Tovey, who liked Sherlock for staying true to the style of the novels despite its modern twist, said of the experience: \\"It's amazing to be a part of it\\", adding, \\"I got to act with Benedict and Martin which was awesome\\". The actor also explained that during his scenes, \\"We did about two and a half weeks of night shoots in Cardiff and I felt like I had jetlag.\\" In terms of Henry's character, Tovey did not want him to be a \\"jibbering wreck\\", but rather mature and truthful as well as damaged and haunted. Gatiss also made Henry display signs of survivor guilt. Tovey's nephew auditioned for the part of a younger Henry, but another child actor was cast for the role as the nephew was considered too young. Background and writing The episode was based on The Hound of the Baskervilles, first serialised in 1901-1902; it is considered one of Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous Holmes stories, as it was written after Doyle killed off Sherlock and, consequently, sold well. It was also one of the most adapted novels in the Sherlock Holmes series. Because of its popularity, writer Mark Gatiss felt a greater responsibility to include familiar elements of the story than he did when adapting the lesser-known stories. Conan Doyle had killed off his famous character in the 1893 story \\"The Final Problem\\", but bowed to popular pressure to write another Holmes adventure. Gatiss observed that Conan Doyle's weariness with the character is demonstrated by Holmes' absence for half of The Hound of the Baskervilles, in which Doctor Watson's role is foregrounded. In contrast to the original, however, the producers decided to centre Sherlock in their adaptation, so Sherlock only threatens to stay behind in London. In addition, the three episodes of the second series show Sherlock dealing, respectively, with love, fear, and death. Here, the producers wanted Sherlock, an arch-rationalist, to confront something that seemed impossible, especially since their Sherlock is still a young character who has not experienced fear yet. Freeman stated that when he sees the hound, Sherlock becomes \\"really terrified\\" and for some time, stops trusting the evidence he has seen. The producers also considered how to make the dog believable because, according to Gatiss, audiences always find the dog disappointing in the adaptations. Therefore, Gatiss wanted the solution to be more than a \\"dog with luminous paint\\". In one scene, Henry has an hallucination in his home, wherein the hound sets off the bright security lights in his back garden. That scene is apparently based on the experience of co-creator Steven Moffat and his executive producer and wife Sue Vertue, who also have bright security lights and are frequently startled whenever the lights turn on at night. There were other differences from the novel. Henry Knight was based on Sir Henry Baskerville, but the character Barrymore, a butler in the book, became an Army major. Another character, Fletcher, was original to the episode; the character was based on Bertram Fletcher Robinson, the journalist who assisted Doyle with the novel. In another scene, John notices what appears to be Morse code, but it is unrelated to the case. Moffat named it the funniest instance where the producers take an element from Doyle's works and \\"do something cheeky with it\\". The Baskerville base was based on Porton Down military science research centre. While conducting research for the episode, Gatiss learned that artists and scientists made a luminous rabbit, using the green fluorescent protein of a jellyfish, which formed the basis for a side story involving a \\"glow-in-the-dark\\" rabbit created at Baskerville by Dr. Stapleton, the mother of the child who wrote to Sherlock at the beginning of the episode requesting that he help her find her missing rabbit. In the episode, it is specified that the spliced-in \\"GFP gene\\" that had allowed the rabbit to glow had come from a jellyfish of the species Aequorea victoria. Also, Gatiss suggested the concept of a \\"mind palace\\", a memory technique originating in Ancient Greece; the idea came from a book by illusionist Derren Brown. This technique would lead Sherlock to the revelation of the secret H.O.U.N.D. project. Early script drafts had Henry accidentally kill Louise Mortimer, but producers were never satisfied with this development, thinking Henry would have failed if she died. Writers also posited that Henry's father's murder involved revenge after he had an affair, but the producers and Gatiss found it easier to mention he died because he learned of Franklin's experiments with the hallucinogenic gas. The ending also changed; the final scene had originally involved Moriarty entering the Tower of London but that was held back for the following episode. Filming and effects The Bush Inn in St Hilary, Vale of Glamorgan, doubled as the Cross Keys pub in Dartmoor. \\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\" took around four weeks to film, with shooting mostly taking place throughout May 2011. Additional scenes were shot later in July and August. Filming on location mostly took place across South Wales, with parts of the episode being shot on location in Dartmoor, even though the producers did not originally intend to do so. The first day took place at a cemetery. The producers were looking for a village in South Wales that was \\"very English-looking.\\" Scenes of the fictional \\"Cross Keys\\" pub were filmed at the Bush Inn in St Hilary, Vale of Glamorgan. The production team donated £500 to the village after filming had finished. In one scene, after Sherlock first witnesses the hound, Sherlock makes deductions about a mother and son from a nearby table. In filming the scene, Cumberbatch has to recall multiple pages of monologue in front of camera, and had to talk faster than he was used to. The scenes at Baskerville were filmed at a number of locations. The exterior was filmed at the gas works by Baverstocks near Llwydcoed in Mid Glamorgan. The labs meanwhile were filmed in two separate locations, one of which was a microchip processing facility. The switch between two locations meant that the crew had to transport a lift set. The scenes in Dewer's Hollow, where the hound was sighted, was filmed near Castell Coch. The reveal scenes in the hollow took two nights to film. At some point filming the scenes were delayed due to rain. The scenes shot in Dartmoor took place in areas such as Haytor and Hound Tor, the latter of which was said to be where the original story was set. Throughout his scenes, Rupert Graves was tanned because before filming the episode, the actor was in Guadeloupe, an island on the Caribbean, appearing in Death in Paradise. As a result, Gatiss added mention that Lestrade went on holiday in the script. In the original episode, John was to hallucinate the hound at a meat storage locker. However, after visiting such a locker in Bristol, the producers came to realise that it would be too expensive, and cold for Freeman, forcing them to change the setting to the Baskerville labs. In one scene, Sherlock is driving a Land Rover with John as a passenger after their arrival at Dartmoor; John was originally going to be the one driving the car, however Freeman cannot drive. In the client scenes, Tovey had to smoke a herbal cigarette as it was illegal to smoke real cigarettes on set. Throughout the episode, the production crew used split dioptres in certain scenes, a camera technique where two separate camera angles are at the same focus on screen. The episode also includes shots of the hound, which was produced by visual effects. Although the series used computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the past, it was the first time a visual effect was made on a large scale. However, there was no guide for the cast to interact with. Broadcast and reception \\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\" was first broadcast on BBC One on Sunday, 8 January 2012 between 8:30 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. It received preliminary overnight figures of 8.16 million viewers with a 29 per cent audience share. It was down by almost 400,000 from the previous week, but it was still the most seen broadcast in its timeslot, beating ITV1 drama Wild at Heart. When final ratings are factored, the episode saw an increase of more than two million viewers, totalling 10.266 million viewers, making it the second most viewed programme for the week. The episode was later repeated on the digital channel BBC Three on Saturday, 14 January 2012 from 7pm, and was seen by 710,000 viewers. It also became the most- watched programme of 2012 on the online BBC iPlayer as of May, with over 1.6 million views. The British Board of Film Classification awarded the episode a 12 certificate for \\"moderate threat and violence.\\" The episode, which is accompanied by an audio commentary by Moffat, Gatiss, Tovey and Vertue, was released with the remainder of the second series in the UK on DVD and Blu-ray on 23 January 2012. Critical reception The scene in which Sherlock clambered to the top of a tor at Dartmoor reminded a critic of Caspar David Friedrich's painting Wanderer above the Sea of Fog. Reviews of the episode were mostly positive. In a pre-broadcast review, Terry Ramsey of The Daily Telegraph labelled the story's shift from a Gothic house to a military research base \\"an inspired piece of modernisation\\". He praised the two lead actors, and say that \\"the script is sharp and witty and the updating is clever, while remaining true to the original. A modern classic.\\" Serena Davies, also of The Daily Telegraph praised the episode for being \\"pacy, sharp and witty, as we've come to expect from the Moffat and Gatiss crack creative duo, and rather less inscrutable than the New Year episode.\\" Davies rated the episode four out of five stars. Chris Harvey, again from The Daily Telegraph identified a range of clues, cultural references and possible inspirations. He suggests that the scene in which \\"Sherlock Holmes clambered alone to the top of a Dartmoor mound and surveyed the landscape below, it appeared to be a direct visual reference to ... Wanderer above the Sea of Fog\\" by 19th century German Romantic landscape painter Caspar David Friedrich. Harvey also identified several references to Thomas Harris' character Hannibal Lecter, plot similarities to the 2005 film Batman Begins, and jokes similar to Scooby- Doo. Sam Wollaston, for The Guardian, favourably compared \\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\" to \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\", writing that the episode \\"has a 21st-century pace to it, and fizzes with the wit we've come to expect from Sherlock ... [recapturing] the essence of The Hound of the Baskervilles ... like the original, it's properly creepy\\". The Radio Timess David Butcher compared the episode to Steven Moffat's series opener, \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\", saying this \\"is more of a creepy affair, all jittery camerawork, paranoia and suspense.\\" Christopher Hootan of Metro thought the episode was \\"the perfect marriage of misty, moor-based foreboding and modern, fast-paced thriller,\\" adding that \\"with a breakneck script and captivating acting from Benedict Cumberbatch, Sherlock offers about the fastest hour and a half of television going at the moment.\\" Louisa Mellor of Den of Geek believed the episode was \\"well-schooled\\" in the horror genre, \\"with plenty of freaking out and jumping at shadows. Arnold and Price's elegant music came to the fore wonderfully in the largely wordless scenes of Watson and Henry's fearful hallucinations.\\" Mellor was also appreciative of McGuigan's \\"stylish hand\\" as director, particularly highlighting the \\"mind palace\\" sequence, as well as Tovey's performance as Henry Knight and for \\"once again\\" seeing Watson's role for being \\"more than just sigh exasperatedly at his flatmate and apologise to others on Sherlock's behalf.\\" In summary, the reviewer stated \\"I can only echo Sherlock's own closing words to Henry: \\"This case, thank you, it's been brilliant\\".\\" Chris Tilly of IGN rated the episode a \\"good\\" 7 out of 10, but stated that although the it was \\"full of mystery and intrigue,\\" the central story \\"wasn't strong enough to fill the 90-minute run-time, running out of steam at the mid-way point and padded out with irrelevant and at times exasperating efforts to throw the audience off the scent.\\" Tilly praised Cumberbatch's performance as a mentally broke down Holmes, and Freeman for being \\"let off the leash this week, with Watson investigating solo on a couple of occasions,\\" and also thought Tovey was a \\"fine addition to the ensemble.\\" David Lewis of CultBox called it \\"a pretty straightforward thriller about chemical warfare, cover-ups and a colossal canine. It's also suspenseful, spooky and superb.\\" The reviewer also commented on the hound's appearance: \\"It isn't [mutant], of course--just an evil-looking mutt hired by Gary and Billy to drum up business for their boozer--and happily, like all the previous hounds that have haunted Holmes in film and TV for nearly a hundred years, it looks gloriously rubbish when it finally appears.\\" Lewis rated the episode four out of five stars. Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy thought \\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\" was \\"an excellent installment of Sherlock — fun, moody and, at times, genuinely scary.\\" Jeffery felt that the final realisation of the hound was impressive, and praised the CGI work, as well as the performance of Cumberbatch and Freeman. However, some critics gave the episode mixed to negative reviews. Tom Ryan of WhatCulture rated the episode two and a half out of five stars, summing up the review with; \\"Given the popularity of the original book and the success thus far of the current TV series, it is safe to assume that last night's episode was perhaps the most eagerly anticipated installment of the show since its inception. Too bad then that it was so underwhelming.\\" The Guardian writer Stuart Heritage stated; \\"Last night's Hounds of Baskervilles wasn't quite as rapturously received as other adventures, perhaps because of the amount of time that Cumberbatch and Freeman spent apart. The whole middle section, where Watson stormed off in a huff after being subjected to another one of Sherlock's baroque \\"that man is left- handed and also has dog hair on one of his socks\\" monologues, felt slow and flat precisely because there was none of the chemistry between the two leads that we've come to expect from Sherlock.\\" Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror stated that the episode was \\"a disappointment,\\" contrasting it against the original book as \\"a tedious treatise against vivisection.\\" However, Shelley stated that he enjoyed the \\"mind palace\\" scene.

The camera was quite unusual: shutter speed and aperture was automatically set by the camera (AE mode), with no user interaction possible. This reduced the user's workload to focusing, releasing the shutter and winding the film. Film winding could be further simplified by attaching an \\"Auto-Winder F\\" to the camera house. Most SLR cameras would at this time be fully manual, with an option of using one or more automatic exposure modes. The FP-1 was basically a point- and-shoot camera, like most viewfinder cameras, but with the benefit of TTL metering and exchangeable lenses. A similar camera, for the same entry-level user group, is the later Canon T-50. The AE mode itself was unusual. The camera operated with only 3 possible apertures, f/2.8, f/5.6 or f/11, and would use shutter speeds from 1/30 to 1/1000 sec. in 1/3 light value steps. A f/1.8 lens would have full light strength in the viewfinder, but at exposure the max. aperture would be f/2.8. An e.g. f/3.5 lens would use f/5.6 as the max aperture during exposure. The only exposure control the user could exercise was to 'cheat' the camera by deliberately mis-setting the film speed. The camera handles and performs well, but suffers from a very loud shutter/mirror operation. The battery control can be cheated: with a lithium battery, the battery control lamp can indicate 'OK', but not have enough energy to release the shutter. The camera has a sturdy feel, except for the very flimsy battery compartment cover. Without a winder attached, large amounts of dust can (and will!) enter the camera through the winder socket. With some third-part optics – some authors specifically name Tamron's Adaptall-II – prolonged use can cause excessive wear on the shutter mechanism.  References  * Anonymous.

Otto was appointed heir of the allodial property of the Guelphs by his uncle Henry the Elder. Duchess Helene died in 1233 and was buried in the Benedictine monastery of St. Michael in Lüneburg.

Each registered object, called a GeoKret (plural: GeoKrety), has a unique tracking code, allowing its movements between locations such as Geocaches to be tracked and registered on the service. While the idea behind trackable items such as GeoKrety originated with the geocoin and travel bug, Geokrety is an independent trackable service that can be used with any geocaching activity. Description A GeoKret can be anything, but in most cases it is a small puppet or other small toy, which can be placed in geocache containers. During the registration of a GeoKret on the website, the owner assigns a name and, optionally, a purpose or mission. These missions can be as simple as travelling as far as possible, or travelling to a specific cache, location or a certain type of location. On GeoKrety.org, each item has an individual page, which tracks its movement and calculates the distance travelled. After registering, the owner must create a label for their GeoKret, with its name, mission, the Tracking Code and the website address. Optionally, the short user's manual and a QR code can be included. The label should then be protected against moisture, e.g. by laminating. GeoKrety are not trade items, therefore it is not compulsory to put something in a cache to take a GeoKret, nor is it required to take something from a cache in exchange for a GK. If a geocacher wants to take something from a cache, they are obligated to make a trade before placing the GK. Furthermore, there is no obligation to pick up a GeoKret from a cache as users can simply mark the item as \\"discovered\\" on the website. In order to log a move or discovery of a GeoKret, users are required to enter its Tracking Code and the location or cache where they left it. The cache can be identified by its waypoint, cache name (the coordinates are acquired automatically from most geocaching services) or by coordinates. The service is free of charge. All content (including descriptions of GeoKrety, illustrations and log entries) made available by publishing them on the site is licensed under a Creative Commons license. The service was founded in October 2007. and is operated by a group of volunteers. As of 8 January 2012 there were 20098 registered GeoKrety and 167009 log entries. All GeoKrety (excluding human- type) travelled 16579482 kilometres. Supported services Geokrety are not associated with any particular geocaching service. Users are allowed to place GeoKrety in caches registered in any database, as well as in other locations (e.g. at home), in which case they are required to provide the coordinates. In order to simplify logging of GeoKrety, the website fetches cache information (like a waypoint name, coordinates, description) from many popular geocaching services. For fully supported services, only a GeoKret's Tracking Code (printed in the label) and the cache's waypoint are required, as all other data (like the cache's title and coordinates) are completed automatically. As of 8 January 2012, there were 665997 waypoints (with full cache information) in the geokrety.org database. When dropping a GeoKret into a cache listed at geocaching.com only, the coordinates must be entered manually. A browser plug- in for Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome is available to automate this. A Free and open-source software android app, GeoKrety Logger, is available on F-Droid. Geokrety categories Depending on its type, a GeoKret needs to be assigned one of the following categories: * Traditional geokret (e.g. a puppet) * Book * CD or DVD * Coin (for coin shaped Geokrety) * Human (for users of this service tracking themselves) QR codes Some GeoKrets have QR code printed on their labels, encoding their tracking code, After taking a photo and decoding the code, the user is automatically taken to the appropriate website to log a move of a GeoKret. Some fields are completed automatically according to information read from the QR code. No special application, except a QR code reader, is required for this task.

Bullock, 2011 MT 328, is a decision by the Montana Supreme Court ruling that the broad free speech protections given to corporations in Citizens United v. FEC do not apply to Montana's campaign finance laws. The United States Supreme Court reversed the Montana Supreme Court's decision in American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock, 567, U.S. 516 (2012), in a short, per curiam opinion issued without oral argument. The Court wrote only that the legal issue had already been precluded by Citizens United, and this case offered no new arguments and failed to distinguish that prior decision. Background In a 1912 ballot initiative, the citizens of Montana passed the Montana Corrupt Practices Act in response to the major influence of corporations on state elections. During the early 20th Century, a number of rich \\"Copper Barons\\" controlled most of the political process through quid pro quo financial transactions with politicians. In response, the state restricted the amount of money that corporations and individuals could donate to campaigns. American Tradition Partnership (ATP), formerly known as Western Tradition Partnership, had challenged the Montana Corrupt Practices Act of 1912, which prohibited independent expenditures to influence political campaigns by corporations, after the United States Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling. ATP was joined in its suit by Champion Painting and the Montana Shooting Sports Association. In October 2010 District Judge Jeffrey Sherlock ruled that the Montana law is unconstitutional. Ruling Judge Sherlock said he agreed with U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson, who overturned a similar ban in Minnesota. Magnuson wrote that Citizens United \\"is unequivocal: The government may not prohibit independent and indirect corporate expenditures on political speech.\\" Montana Attorney General Steve Bullock, a Democrat who had been elected to that office in 2008, argued on behalf of the State of Montana that the Corrupt Practices Act should remain in place. Opinion of the Montana Supreme Court In response to a potential Supreme Court challenge, the majority opinion included a great deal of historical evidence to document the \\"corrupting influence of campaign contributions on elections.\\" Citizens United focused primarily on the free speech limitations of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, whereas the Montana Court focused on the historical precedent for allowing campaign finance restrictions.Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, In particular, the Montana Court called the Supreme Court's declaration that corporations have the same constitutional rights as individual citizens \\"utter nonsense.\\" The use of abundant historical precedent allowed the majority to argue that their ruling is consistent with the original intent of the First Amendment. Additionally, the Montana Court called Citizens United a \\"crabbed view of corruption\\" and argued that prior to Montana's campaign finance laws \\"the state of Montana and its government were operating under a mere shell of legal authority.\\" The majority criticized Citizens United as being unrealistic about the corrupting influence of unlimited secret money, and the court cited a litany of evidence to prove the direct correlation between independent expenditures and political corruption. The Montana Court believed that this ruling does not blatantly contradict Citizens United because the ruling deals with a law that has major differences from the McCain-Feingold Act (the law that Citizens United partially overturned). Dissent James Nelson, who was one of the two dissenters, agreed with the majority opinion and called the reasoning of Citizens United \\"smoke and mirrors,\\" but he did not believe that the Montana Court had the authority to contradict the Supreme Court. According to Nelson, when the highest court makes a constitutional ruling, all other courts must follow it. U.S. Supreme Court per curiam reversal and implication American Tradition Partnership appealed the Montana Supreme Court decision after the court issued its decision. \\"If Montana is allowed to flout this court's holdings in Citizens United in such a willful and transparent fashion, respect for the Constitution, the rule of law and this court will be eroded,\\" James Bopp, American Tradition Partnership lawyer, argued. In February 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the decision pending further review by the high court. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer released a short statement, urging the Court to revisit Citizens United and \\"to consider whether, in light of the huge sums of money currently deployed to buy candidate's allegiance, Citizens United should continue to hold sway.\\" The justices asked the Court to pay attention to the empirical evidence of corruption caused by the new unlimited spending, a problem that the majority downplayed in their opinion. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Montana Supreme Court without hearing oral argument in American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock, 567 U.S. 516 (2012) by a short, per curiam opinion. The Court wrote only that \\"[t]here can be no serious doubt\\" that the holding of Citizens United applies to the Montana state law, as per U.S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, and that \\"Montana's arguments in support of the judgment below either were already rejected in Citizens United, or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case.\\" Justices Breyer dissented in an opinion joined by Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan. He would have reconsidered Citizens United or its applicability to the case at hand but believed that the votes to make such an effort meaningful did not exist. The Court has not summarily reversed any lower Court with four strongly dissenting Justices with so little analysis since 1968. With its ruling the Supreme Court upheld its Citizens United landmark decision. While the Citizens United decision initially appeared to apply equally to state contests, the Supreme Court ruled in American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock that the Citizens United holding does so by applying it to Montana state law. Because the Citizens United decision supersedes state law the states cannot bar corporate and union political contributions in their own elections.

In mid-1964 the home was almost destroyed as a fire hazard as it had fallen into disrepair and transients were living in it. A shed is attached to the north side of the house. The second floor was built in 1882. Prior to that Kluge had apparently done significant work on the original cabin's first floor, which has hewn squared logs. The second floor is half- timber filled in with bricks. The second floor diagonal logs brace the framing logs. The overall dimensions of the house are 30'-11\\" x 16'-4\\" with a foundation of stone found locally. There are front and rear doors on the first floor. The front door is asymmetrically located and the rear door is near a corner. The second floor is reached only via an exterior staircase. The house has a brick fireplace. The first floor has an entrance vestibule and two rooms of dissimilar size. The smaller room has a hatch leading to a cellar. The second floor has a floor plan that is very similar to that of the first floor but it is reversed, i.e., two rooms and a vestibule. Floors are wooden. Emil Kluge was born March 28, 1845 in Prussia. Kluge served in the infantry, in both the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 and the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, in the latter of which he was wounded. Kluge and his family came to America from Germany in 1871, first settling in Detroit, Michigan for two years, and then Helena, Montana, arriving on May 3, 1873. At that time, the family moved into this house, which was an abandoned miner's cabin. Kluge worked mostly as a contractor, but also as a gold prospector, constable, and Justice of the Peace. He was an officer in one of Helena's Masonic lodges and was a member of the Odd Fellows. Kluge resided in Helena until his death, September 26, 1924.

Formed by brothers Chris and Denny Hanson in 1969, the company became a huge success in the late 1970s. A series of missteps in the early 1980s led to a rapid death spiral and the company went bankrupt in 1984. It was purchased by Daiwa, a Japanese fishing tackle company that handled Hanson's distribution in Japan. Daiwa ended sales in North America and Europe. European products, notably the famous Salomon SX series, used Hanson's exit as a springboard to market domination during the second half of the 1980s. Denny Hanson later introduced the \\"Apex\\" design, which combines features of alpine and snowboarding boots. History Flo-fit Alden Hanson Sr. was the chief scientist at Dow Chemical during the 1950s and '60s. He led development of a Silly Putty-like plastic known as \\"Flo-fit\\" and started looking for applications. Alden's son Chris used some in an effort to make a better ski boot, which at the time were simple leather boots that were extremely uncomfortable and quickly wore out. Chris built a fiberglass shell that fitted over the entire foot area of the boot to provide support, and then filled the gap with Flo-fit to provide cushioning between the two. The prototype was only one boot, not a pair, and Chris stopped work on the design. Around the same time, Bob Lange started work on a new ski boot design using plastics in place of leather. It took several years of development before he had a suitable design, and widespread sales started in the winter of 1965-66. These early designs were very stiff and offered a tremendous improvement in control, but they became even more uncomfortable than the leather designs they replaced when the inner liner lost its elasticity around pressure points. The area around the leg cuff and especially the ankle would wear out quickly and could draw blood. In 1968, Alden Hanson started negotiations with Bob Lange to add Flo-fit to Lange's boot designs. Lange proved interested, and hired Chris, an industrial designer, and his brother Denny (Alden Hanson Jr.), a salesman for Head Skis, to help design a system to incorporate the newly christened \\"Lange-flo\\" into their boot lineup. However, Chris proved more interested in developing a new boot design than working on Lange-flo, and Lange dismissed them both in 1969.Masia appears to disagree in the two references below; one suggests the two left Lange in 1969 to work on the boot design, but the other implies that they were fired sometime later. The date of formation of the company suggests that the 1969 date is correct. However, the liners ended up failing when the Lange-flo interacted with the vinyl in cold weather. This allowed the Lange- flo to squeeze into the boot, and led to millions of dollars in warranty work in the 1969-1970 season. Forming Hanson During 1969, the Hansons were building prototypes of their new boot design, and in June 1970, they formed Hanson Industries to produce them. The boot was moulded in two halves, front and back, both of relatively simple shaping that made them very easy to remove from the moulds, at least compared to traditional front-entry designs like Lange where the shaping results in complex moulds. A single buckle locked the rear portion forward onto the front for closure. Unlike later designs, the Hanson boot did not have a pivot point to allow forward flex of the leg. Instead, the one-piece forward section ran from the toe to the mid-calf area as a continuous piece, and was designed to be flexible. The rear section of the boot fit inside the front, clamping forward. When the skier flexed forward, the front section would simply bend with the leg, and the rear section would be pulled forward with it by the buckle. The inner liner was a one-piece system similar to a thick sock. As the foot area was a single piece there was no way to snug it down; instead it was made very large and fit to an individual's foot shape by filling a plastic bag over the instep with hot wax. The design was released during 1971, and during the fall they shipped 2,500 pairs to stores across the US. They proved to be a hit, and by 1975, the company was competing with Lange for the number one position in the boot market. Improvements followed in the Riva design, which split the front section into left and right sections and held them together with a clip. By moving the clip up or down a fitting along the instep, the forward flex could be easily controlled. With the clip at the top position, on the shin, the front section of the boot had to move forward as a unit, set lower on the leg or even over the foot area allowed some of the forward motion to push the two halves apart to the side, lowering resistance. Continued success During the later half of the 1970s, many ski and boot companies rushed to introduce their own rear-entry designs. This was particularly attractive to companies that had not previously been involved in boots, as the traditional market for front-entry systems was fairly well established. O'Brien, Scott and Rosemount all introduced versions similar to the Hanson. K2 introduced the \\"Three\\", which reversed the Hanson pattern by making the rear flap much larger and bucking on the front like a conventional front-entry design. None of these had a major impact on Hanson's sales, and in the period between 1978 and 1981, the company was shipping an average of 120,000 pairs of boots a year. This represented about half of the high end boot market in the US, at least on a dollar basis. Flush with success, Hanson decided to reverse this pattern and enter the ski market. Hexcel produced a well-regarded product using a honeycomb material in place of wood or foam, but the company decided to focus on the aerospace market and was looking to sell their ski factory. Hanson purchased the entire line. They also arranged a deal with the Spyder ski wear brand, offering high-end racing boots under this marque. Rapid failure Hanson had decided from the start to try to keep steady employment through the year, instead of using temporary workers to fill the needs of the winter season rush. To do this, the company borrowed money from the banks to fund production, which it repaid with the proceeds from sales during the winter. When US interest rates soared to 22% in 1980, the company was hard hit. They started looking for a European factory, but never finalized a deal. To add to their problems, the winter of 1982-83 was famed for a lack of snow, and the entire ski industry was hard hit. Many Hanson dealers failed to pay, and the company quickly ran out of cash. In 1984, they sold the company to Daiwa, their Japanese distributor, who quickly withdrew the brand from North America and Europe. It continues to exist in Japan.Masia (2003) states the company went bankrupt in 1981; Masia (2007) states it was 1983/84. The date of known examples of the Spyder boots suggests that the later time is correct. Salomon's success Salomon started as a ski binding company, but watched the boot market throughout the 1970s. In 1979, they introduced their first boot, the SX90, a complex rear-entry design. The design did not sell well, with only 30,000 examples shipping in the next two seasons. Salomon continued development, and in 1983, they introduced the SX91 design. The SX91 offered easy control over almost every possible movement of the boot. It was a huge success, entering the market right as Hanson was in the process of exiting it. Sales were limited only by their ability to manufacture enough to meet demand. Entries from Nordica and the three-part designs from Raichle propelled the rear-entry design to the forefront, making up about 80% of the market in 1987. After Hanson After selling the company, the Hanson brothers continued to work with the Flo-fit material, founding the Flolite company and offering a number of products outside the ski industry. These included boot inserts, bike seats and wheel chair cushions, among others. During the 2000s, Denny re- entered the ski boot market with the Apex ski boot. The Apex consists of two entirely separate parts, a semi-stiff boot that uses the Boa Closure System instead of laces or buckles, and an outer carbon fibre shell that provides the needed lateral support and mounting points for conventional downhill ski bindings.\\"Apex Ski Boots\\" References ;Notes ;Citations ;Bibliography * Seth Masia, \\"The Rear-Entry Boot: A Life Cut Short\\", Skiing Heritage Journal, June 2007, pp. 40-42 * Seth Masia, \\"Hansons Still At It, Darcy Holds Forth\\", Skiing Heritage Journal, March 2003, p. 42 Hanson Category:Ski boots ","title":"Hanson Industries (ski boots)"},{"id":"34318737","text":"Richard J.

College career Stanford On January 5, 2012, during the U.S. Army All-American Bowl, Sanders announced that he had committed to playing football for Stanford University, even though he was still unsure if he would be admitted. According to ESPN, he was rated the 6th-best high school running back in the country. He was indeed admitted to Stanford, and he did join the Cardinal football team but he was redshirted as a freshman, seeing no action during the 2012 college season. During his redshirt freshman season in 2013, he was used sparingly as a running back and kick returner. He played in 12 of the Cardinal's 14 games, finishing the year with 34 rushing yards, 5 rushing attempts, and 1 touchdown. He played in all 13 games his sophomore season, finishing the 2014 season with 59 carries for 315 yards and 7 receptions for 47 yards. Sanders returned in 2015 for his redshirt junior year and contributed as a back-up running back, kick returner and special-teams player. He played behind sophomore All-American and Heisman Trophy finalist Christian McCaffrey. Amongst his many other accomplishments that season, McCaffrey broke the elder Barry Sanders' longstanding record for most all-purpose yards in a season. The younger Barry Sanders played well in his limited backup role. During the season opener on September 5, 2015, at Northwestern University, he gained 9 yards on 2 carries. The following week, he would have a career game against the University of Central Florida. Sanders finished the game with 8 carries, 39 rushing yards, and 1 touchdown. On September 25, 2015, he continued producing for the Cardinal, rushing for a career-high 97 yards, on 7 carries, for a career-high 2 rushing touchdowns against Oregon State. During the contest he had 65 yards come on a rushing touchdown play. Sanders continued his streak the next game against the University of Arizona, ending the game with 76 yards on 4 rushing attempts, and a single touchdown. On October 15, 2015, Sanders had a career-high 10 carries for 39 yards against UCLA. On January 5, 2016, Sanders announced that he had been granted a release from his scholarship by Stanford and intended on exploring his options to transfer to another school. He graduated in June 2016 after four years on campus, including his redshirt season; hence he had one year of eligibility left as a fifth year senior. As a graduate transfer, he would be eligible to play immediately at his new school. Oklahoma State On February 11, 2016, Sanders announced that he was planning to enroll in a master's degree program at Oklahoma State, his father's alma mater. Since he was a graduate transfer, he was eligible to play immediately for the 2016 season. Wearing number 26 (the same number he wore at Stanford), Sanders returned the first punt of his Oklahoma State career 57 yards, down to the half-yard line, nearly scoring on his first return. For the season, he had 28 carries for 93 yards and two touchdowns. He also caught nine passes for 45 yards, and returned 18 kickoffs and seven punts. After the season, he accepted a marketing job with the video game company Electronic Arts, and he announced that he had no plans to try to play professional football.

Two genera are currently included in the family, Nanictidops from South Africa and Purlovia from Russia. Nanictidopids have short skulls and were probably herbivorous. Description In comparison to other therocephalians, nanictidopids are relatively large, with skulls ranging from in length. Nanictidopids are characterized by their shortened skulls that appear triangular when viewed from above. The temporal region of the skull is very wide. Their skulls are similar to those of hofmeyriids, and the superfamily Nanictidopoidea has been established to unite these two groups. Nanictidopids have enlarged canine teeth in their upper and lower jaws, while the teeth behind them are very small. Small bumps and ridges cover parts of the upper and lower jaws. The parietal region at the back of the skull forms a sagittal crest. The postorbital bones that make up the back of the eye sockets are very thin, and sometimes do not enclose the entire socket. Unlike more advanced therocephalians, nanictidopids lack a secondary palate. History Nanictidopidae was named in 1956 by paleontologists D. M. S. Watson and Alfred Romer. Watson and Romer included many therocephalians in the family, including Blattoidealestes, Choerosaurus, Hofmeyria, and Promoschorhynchus. These therocephalians have since been split up among other families like Hofmeyriidae and Akidnognathidae. Paleobiology Except for the canines, nanictidopids lack the large pointed teeth of carnivorous therocephalians. Nanictidopids are thought to have been herbivorous, but they lack the enlarged buccal or cheek teeth of most herbivores. Although wear facets indicate use, most teeth are small and would have served little function in processing plant material. Another adaptation toward herbivory is the development of horny plates on the palate, but nanictidopids show no evidence of this adaptation either. One of the few indications of diet comes from a broken and polished canine in a specimen of Purlovia. In life, this tooth may have been broken and worn smooth as it was digging for food. Nanictidopids were most likely primitive herbivores, possibly fruit-eating.

The Antarctic scallop (Adamussium colbecki) is the only species in the genus though its exact relationship to other members of the family is unclear. It is found in the ice-cold seas surrounding Antarctica, sometimes at great depths. Adamussium colbecki is a large, slow- growing scallop that lives on the seabed. The shell consists of a pair of ribbed calcareous valves which enclose the soft body and are joined by a ligament at a hinge. It feeds on microscopic green algae and is sometimes present in great numbers. It is able to move around by flapping its valves and to dart backwards to escape threats. The species is an important member of the Antarctic seabed community as the upper valve often acts as a substrate for seaweeds, sponges and other organisms. In addition, juveniles bind themselves by threads to the upper valve of older shells, using these as a base for several years as they grow. The adult scallops have been used in research to study the accumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms. Taxonomy The Antarctic scallop was first described by the British zoologist Edgar Albert Smith in 1902 as Pecten colbecki. He worked at the British Museum and was responsible for examining and describing shells from collections made over the years that had been deposited there. The German malacologist Johannes Thiele determined in 1934 that the characteristics of the Antarctic scallop were sufficiently different from those of other members of the genus Pecten to warrant its inclusion in a separate genus, Adamussium. More recently, examinations of the chromosome structure and of the mitochondrial DNA of A. colbecki have been undertaken, but the exact phylogenetic relationship it has with other pectinids is still unclear. Description The shell of the Antarctic scallop grows to about long and 7 centimetres wide and has a nearly circular outline. The two purplish-red valves are paper thin and only slightly convex and are attached by a long, slightly sinuous, hinge. Near the hinge there is an umbo or beak on each valve, a raised hump from which the ribs radiate. The umbones are not very prominent and on either side of them are irregular winged processes, the auricles. In smaller specimens there are around 12 shallow ribs diverging from the umbones and further low ridges appear between these as the shell grows larger. There is a fine sculpturing of concentric lines on the outside of the valves. The auricles are also finely sculpted with the annual growth lines visible. The interior of the valves is pink. A fringe of numerous small tentacles project from the mantle between the two valves and there are a number of simple eyes in a row around the rim. The valves are held closed by powerful adductor muscles which work in opposition to an elastic ligament that lies just behind the umbones and which tends to open the valves. The flanges of the auricles provide a wide attachment for this ligament. The Antarctic scallop could be confused with other scallops, other bivalves or lamp shells.Mollusca: Adamussium colbecki CCAMLR VME Taxa Classification Guide(2009). Retrieved 2012-04-07. Distribution and habitat The Antarctic scallop is endemic to the waters surrounding Antarctica. These are mostly within the Antarctic Circle and include the Ross Sea, the Weddell Sea, the Davis Sea, McMurdo Sound and the Southern Ocean. Although it is commonly found at depths of less than , remotely operated underwater vehicles armed with lights and cameras have recorded the scallop at much greater depths, including one recording at . It is found on many different substrates including sand, gravel and silt, either on the surface or semi-submerged in the sediment. It can flap its gills slightly to create a hollow in which to settle. In shallow waters it is usually attached by byssus threads to hard surfaces so as not to be swept away by water movement. At greater depths it is usually free living.Adamussium colbecki (Smith, 1902) Antarctic Field Guide. Retrieved 2012-01-07. Although the Antarctic scallop has a circum-polar distribution, this is very disjunct, and overall it is not common. In some places it is found at densities of up to 90 per square metre and in Terra Nova Bay in the Ross Sea, at depths between and , some scallop beds were found to be so crowded that adult individuals were lying on top of others. In other locations that seem eminently suitable in many ways, it was entirely absent. A possible explanation for this lies in the fact that its paper thin shell is characteristic of bivalves living in stable, deep water areas with little water movement. The shallower locations in which it now thrives are characterised by being protected bays or by having extensive sea ice coverage, each of which provides a stable environment unaffected by storm waves and where iceberg scouring does not normally occur. It is also absent from habitats dominated by other benthic suspension feeding communities whereas it is found in habitats with soft sediments and no dominant cnidarian and sponge communities. This might be because its larvae face such heavy predation in these locations that it is unable to establish itself. Behaviour Locomotion The Antarctic scallop can swim rather slowly by opening and closing its valves. It advances in this way with the rim of the shell to the front. It can detect the movement of nearby objects with its rudimentary eyes and, in order to escape predators, can move much more swiftly umbones first, by clapping its valves shut. A remotely controlled camera stationed on the sea bed is apt to find that all the scallops that were originally in its field of view have moved off to other locations. Feeding Like other members of the family Pectinidae, the Antarctic scallop is a suspension feeder, extracting its nourishment from the sea water that surrounds it. Bands of cilia on the velum, a curtain-like fold of the mantle, waft particles towards the gills. Oxygen is absorbed by the gills and food particles, mostly microscopic algae, are trapped in mucous and transported to the mouth by cilia. There is a seasonal increase in microscopic ice algae which become available to suspension feeders when the sea ice melts in the summer, and most of the annual growth takes place at this time. Research has shown that this is as a result of the rise in sea temperature and not the greater availability of food. Reproduction The rate of growth of the Antarctic scallop is very slow compared to that of scallops living in warmer seas. It matures at 5 to 7 years old and spawning takes place in late summer. Little is known about the development of the veliger larvae but they may be planktonic for 4 or 5 months. Besides feeding on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, they may absorb dissolved organic matter and consume bacterioplankton. When they settle, metamorphosis takes place and the juveniles attach themselves with byssus threads, often attaching these to the upper valves of scallops, and remain attached for 3 to 5 years. While attached to the adult shell, the juveniles benefit from food particles in the fine detritus thrown up into the water column by movements of the adult. While studying the sizes and growth rates of adults, researchers came to realize that there were gaps in their records which were due to the fact that, in some years, no juveniles had survived. Ecology Underwater in McMurdo Sound with an ice wall behind and many Antarctic scallops, several sea urchins, Sterechinus neumayeri and brittle stars, Ophionotus victoriae, and a white club-shaped sponge, Homaxinella balfourensis The Antarctic scallop is monitored in connection with the Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VME) classification set up by the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). As such, notification is required to be made by vessels that land the scallop as by- catch during their fishing activities. The Antarctic scallop is often found living in association with the Antarctic sea urchin, Sterechinus neumayeri, and Odontaster validus, a species of sea star. Predatory invertebrates found in the vicinity of the Antarctic scallop include the gastropod Neobuccinum eatoni, and the ribbon worm Parborlasia corrugatus. The Antarctic scallop does not itself have many predators and large individuals are adept at jumping and swimming to escape attackers. Any attached juveniles benefit from this. However, the scallops are intolerant of low salinity levels, and mortality sometimes occurs as a result of a pool of relatively fresh water that sometimes forms during the summer months under the sea ice as it melts. There are a large number of epifaunal organisms living on the shells of Antarctic scallops, which may represent 90% of the hard substrate available in a region where rocky surfaces are not common and much of the seabed consists of sediment. Because a diverse community of invertebrates and algae use its shell as a base, the Antarctic scallop is considered to be a \\"foundation species\\"; a species of great importance in its habitat. The fact that the scallops can swim and move to other locations aids in the dispersal of these organisms. The epiphytes include benthic diatoms, forams, bacteria, bryozoans, sponges and algae. The foram Cibicides refulgens lives parasitically on the scallop's shell and also grazes on the algae and bacteria growing there. In a research study, 10 different species of demosponge were found growing on a single Antarctic scallop. The demosponge Homaxinella balfourensis was one of the commonest epibionts growing harmlessly on the scallop's shell. The relationship between sponge and scallop may be symbiotic; the sponge avoids being engulfed in sediment while the scallop benefits from the protection provided by the sponge, which is distasteful to many predators. The hydroid Hydractinia angusta has a mutualistic relationship with the scallop. A study showed that its larvae preferentially settled in the vicinity of other epibionts, usually on scallop shells, and that the scallop larvae were deterred from settling in the vicinity of colonies of the hydroid. It is surmised that the hydroid benefits from a solid substrate on which to live, and although the scallop benefits from the protection from predators provided by the stinging cells of the hydroid, it is disadvantaged by the failure of its larvae to establish themselves in their preferred location, on the shells of mature scallops. Research A laboratory study examined the effects on the Antarctic scallop of an increase in lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges. Another study analysed the tissues of Adamussium colbecki and compared them with those of Pecten jacobaeus, a temperate water species of scallop. It was found that copper, iron, cadmium and chromium were concentrated in the digestive organ of the Antarctic scallop. Cadmium levels in particular were higher in the Antarctic scallop than in P. jacobaeus and other pectinids, but zinc and manganese, found in the kidney, were considerably lower.

At the time, the world record for the 100 metres was 10.0 seconds, hand timed, set and equalled over the years by Armin Hary (Germany) and Harry Jerome (Canada) in 1960, Horacio Esteves (Venezuela) and Bob Hayes (United States) in 1964, Jim Hines (United States) and Enrique Figuerola (Cuba) in 1967, and by Paul Nash (South Africa) and Oliver Ford (United States) earlier in 1968. Earlier in the day, with the maximum allowable wind of , Roger Bambuck (France) and Charles Greene (United States) had again tied the world record. With an aiding wind of , Hines won the first semi-final, timed in 9.9 seconds, to set the new world record, but in second place Ronnie Ray Smith was also credited with the same time, equalling the world record. Minutes later in the second semi-final, with a aiding wind Greene was also given the same time. As this was before the acceptance of fully automatic timing, the hand times were official, each recorded by three separate hand timed stopwatches. An experimental Accutrack automatic timing device was being used for this meet: the times recorded by it showed Hines ran 10.03, Smith 10.14, and Greene 10.10, information held for the interest of future track statisticians. Later that evening, Greene went on to win the National Championship, in a wind aided Later that year, with the assistance of the altitude of Mexico City at the 1968 Olympics, Hines improved the record to 9.95 while winning the gold medal on October 14, which was to become the first accepted fully automatic timed world record accepted when the IAAF adopted such times in 1977. At those same Olympics, Greene took the bronze medal and all three teamed with Mel Pender to win the gold medal in the 4x100 m relay in world record time. Over the next eight seasons, before the IAAF changed their record criteria, six more individuals tied the 9.9 hand timed world record. The automatic 9.95 was not surpassed until 1983, when Calvin Smith ran 9.93, again at altitude, at the U.S. Air Force Academy near It is worth noting that Bob Hayes was timed at 9.9 seconds four years earlier in the final of the 100 metres at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo. The official time was given as 10.0 seconds because of an idiosyncratic method of measuring the 'hand' times which was only used at that Olympics.

Writers Batmanglij and Marling spent two months in 2009 practicing freeganism and co-wrote a screenplay inspired by their experiences and drawing on thrillers from the 1970s. The American studio Fox Searchlight Pictures had bought rights to distribute Batmanglij's previous film Sound of My Voice and also collaborated with the director to produce The East. With Ridley Scott as producer and Tony Scott as executive producer, Fox Searchlight contracted Scott Free Productions, headquartered in London, to produce the film. The East was filmed in two months in Shreveport, Louisiana at the end of 2011. The film premiered to strong reviews at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival on , 2013. It was released in theaters on , 2013. Plot Jane (Brit Marling), an operative for private intelligence firm Hiller Brood, is assigned by her boss, Sharon (Patricia Clarkson), to infiltrate The East, an underground activist, anarchist and environmentalist organization that has launched a vandalistic attack against a corporate leader and threatens two more as retribution for ecological crimes. Calling herself Sarah, she joins drifters in hitching train rides. When one drifter, Luca (Shiloh Fernandez), helps her escape from the police, she identifies the symbol of The East hanging from Luca's car mirror. Sarah self-inflicts an arm injury that she tells Luca was caused in the escape so he can get her medical attention. He takes her to a seemingly abandoned house in the woods where members of The East live and one of them, Doc (Toby Kebbell), treats her. Sarah is given two nights to recover before she must leave. At an elaborate dinner involving straitjackets, Sarah is tested and fails, exposing how selfishly she and many others live their lives. Sarah is caught spying one night by the deaf Eve and talks in sign language with her. Sarah tells Eve that she is an undercover agent and threatens Eve with jail if she stays; Eve leaves the next morning. Sarah is recruited to fill the missing member's role on a \\"jam\\", an old fashioned term for direct action. Sarah reluctantly participates in The East's next jam and learns that the group's members have all been damaged by corporate activities. For example, Doc was poisoned by a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and his neurosystem is degenerating. The East infiltrates a party for the antibiotic company's senior executives and adds the antibiotic to the champagne. The East announce this via YouTube: one executive's health begins to fail, revealing the drug's side effects. After seeing the jam's effectiveness, compounded by her attraction to charismatic Benji (Alexander Skarsgård), Sarah questions the morality of her job. Another member, Izzy (Ellen Page), is the daughter of a petrochemical CEO. The group uses this connection to gain access to him and forces him to bathe in the waterway he has been using as a toxic dumping ground. This goes wrong when security arrives and shoots the fleeing Izzy. At the squat, Doc's hands tremble too much for him to perform surgery. Working under his guidance, Sarah manages to remove the bullet but Izzy dies. This is the catalyst for Sarah and Benji's romance and they have sex. At Izzy's burial near the house, her body lies nude and decorated with blossoms in a nod to the romance and the sea change it portends. Sarah implores Benji to leave but he insists they participate in a fourth and final jam. Sarah initially refuses but gives in. When she awakens after sleeping in the car, she realizes that Benji is driving her to Hiller Brood's headquarters. He reveals that he has always suspected her of being a spy, as did Luca, who brought her in as a test. Benji wants Sarah to obtain a NOC global list of Hiller Brood agents, to \\"watch\\" them. Having copied the list on to her cell phone's memory card, Sarah runs into Sharon and confronts her about the firm's activities, revealing her new allegiances. Sharon has Sarah's cellphone confiscated as she leaves. As Hiller Brood had been sharing information with the FBI, The East's hideout is raided and Doc is arrested but sacrifices himself to ensure the remaining members escape. Sarah tells Benji she has failed to get the NOC list which Benji reveals he meant to use to expose the undercover agents, even though that meant they could be killed. Sarah chooses not to go on the run and they part as Benji heads out of the country. In truth, Sarah still has the list because she had swallowed the memory card. The film ends with an epilogue of her contacting her undercover former coworkers and informing them of the corporate crimes Hiller Brood's clients want to protect. She is thus using a peaceful approach to promote The East's goals.

He co-wrote the screenplay with Brit Marling, who also stars in the film. Batmanglij and Marling also wrote the screenplay for Sound of My Voice and went to Los Angeles in 2009 to produce a film. Due to the economy, they could not make the film that year. They were then inspired by the concept of Buy Nothing Day, an international day of protest against consumerism, and decided to experience a Buy Nothing summer. They spent two months in 2009 with proponents of freeganism, which is a practice of eating \\"discarded food in their pursuit of a moneyless existence\\". Marling said, \\"We wanted to have some adventure, and we didn't have any money. We learned to hop trains, we learned to sleep on rooftops, we learned to claim the space that feels so private. We joined this anarchist collective.\\" The pair drew from their experiences as well as thriller films like All The President's Men, The Bourne Identity and Michael Clayton to craft The East, which they wrote before they began filming Sound of My Voice for a 2011 release. Director Zal Batmanglij Batmanglij and Marling wrote to have the anarchist organization target a multinational corporation instead of a government. Marling said, \\"Multinational corporations are outside of the purview of any nation-state. These are the entities that are shaping and running the world... The modern anarchy movement is about rebelling against the corporate structure.\\" Batmanglij said the film focused on the pharmaceutical industry due to the writers hearing stories about the side effects of drugs, such as a drug to help quit smoking that resulted in some people committing suicide. He said they considered focusing on banks due to the financial crisis of 2007–2008, but they chose the pharmaceutical industry so the mission in the film would have emotional resonance. They titled the film The East to make a variety of references. The director explained, \\"'The East' is ... the East Coast, which is like something in our American collective consciousness—New England, tony, center of power. The Wicked Witch of the East in the Oz mythology was the bad witch because the book was about how the Midwest was getting screwed over by the east, by Washington. And then of course we have the Middle East or the Far East, which is seen as different or other. The ultimate Other. So, it's funny that this word means two things, and I thought that was an interesting name for a resistance group that is combined of kids from New England who want to make themselves the Other.\\" Sound of My Voice, directed by Batmanglij and starring Marling, screened at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival in January. Producer Michael Costigan, who liked Sound of My Voice, got a copy of the screenplay for The East. Costigan liked the screenplay and approached Batmanglij to say that he and his fellow producers Ridley Scott and Tony Scott at Scott Free Productions were interested in making the film. After the festival, Fox Searchlight Pictures acquired distribution rights for Sound of My Voice and Another Earth (also starring Marling). In the process, the distributor greenlighted production of The East. By September 2011, Marling and Alexander Skarsgård were cast in the starring roles. Felicity Jones was attached to play Izzy, but she dropped out to promote Like Crazy. Jones was replaced by Ellen Page. Production of the film, which had a budget of , took place in Shreveport, Louisiana. Production designer Alex DiGerlando converted an alternative lifestyle club in Shreveport into a house for The East. The club was originally painted black and gold, and it was repainted different shades of green for the film. Filming took place in late 2011; Batmanglij said it lasted . The director compared the film's ambivalent ending to the one in the 2002 film 25th Hour: \\"I feel like it's almost as if the film’s events never happened at its end... It's sort of like what we're all capable of if we put our minds to it. There's a lot of work that needs to be done in order to make changes, even for her to make changes.\\" Release Screenings Michigan Theater The film premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival on , 2013. The Sundance Institute, as part of their Sundance Film Festival USA program, screened The East at the Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor, Michigan on , 2013. Over 1,300 people were in attendance for the screening, and Zal Batmanglij and Brit Marling showed for a Q&A; session. Leading up to its theatrical release in May 2013, The East was chosen as the closing night film of the South by Southwest (SXSW) Film Conference and Festival, and went on to screen at the Phoenix Film Festival, Seattle International Film Festival, and the San Francisco International Film Festival. The Washington Post reported that Q&A; sessions after the film's screenings were popular. It said, \\"Filmgoers might not have agreed on their feelings about 'The East,' but they had one thing in common: They needed to talk about it.\\" According to Batmanglij, the Sundance screening retained 98% of the audience for its Q&A; session. The East had its New York City premiere on , 2013. It was released in four theaters in Los Angeles and New York City on May 31, 2013. The film grossed $77,031 over the opening weekend, a theater average of $19,258. Indiewire reported, \\"That's a strong number in general and also a big step up from Batmanglij and Marling's previous collaboration.\\" TheWrap said the film had a strong start, while Box Office Mojo said it \\"opened to modest results\\". In its second weekend, the release was expanded to . It grossed $228,561 over the weekend. Overall, it grossed . Critical response The Wall Street Journal reported that at the Sundance Film Festival, the film \\"opened to mostly strong reviews\\". Varietys Justin Chang reviewed the film, \\"This clever, involving spy drama builds to a terrific level of intrigue before losing some steam in its second half.\\" He noted that, \\"the appreciable growth in filmmaking confidence here should translate into a fine return on Fox Searchlight's investment\\". John DeFore, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, described The East as \\"a social-conscience espionage film that has actually thought about its 'eco-terrorism' themes beyond figuring out how to mine them for suspense\\". He said, \\"Batmanglij balances emotional tension with practical danger nicely, a must in a story whose activist protagonists can make no distinction between the personal and the political.\\" Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave The East 5 stars and highlighted it as a Sundance standout. He said the film felt like a \\"sophisticated\\" Earth First! take of The Parallax View and other 1970s films with the theme of paranoia. Logan Hill, reviewing for indieWire, said, \\"Fast-paced and energetic, 'The East' hits a beat and hurries along to the next 'Jam.' As slickly paced as a big-studio espionage movie, it nearly succeeds as a pure adrenaline-rush thriller. In the end, the problem isn't that there's too much plot, but rather a certain dramatic illogic.\\" Hill commended the cast and said of the direction, \\"Batmanglij has a particular talent for capturing that unmoored, twentysomething search for meaning, and the tight-knit allure of a group that offers a reason for living. But the film is so plot-driven, those don't have much room to breathe.\\" Following the film's release in May, the film review aggregation website Metacritic surveyed and assessed 26 reviews to be positive, nine to be mixed, and one to be negative. It gave an aggregate score of 68 out of 100, which it said indicated \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Another review aggregator, Rotten Tomatoes, surveyed and, categorizing the reviews as positive or negative, assessed 104 as positive and 37 as negative. It gave the film a score of 74% and summarized the critical consensus, \\"Tense, thoughtful, and deftly paced, The East is a political thriller that never loses sight of the human element.\\" Home media The East was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the United States on September 17, 2013 and in the UK on November 5, 2013.

The TV audio bands are obsolete and not usable with digital TV channels. Overall view of portable radio. TV radio, TV band radio, and TV audio radio are common names for a type of radio receiver that can play the audio portion of a TV channel. The actual name of the device may comprise a list of all frequency bands the device can receive (e.g. AM, FM, weather, TV radio), one or two of which includes the TV channel bands.  Analog tuning of analog TV audio  For the increasingly uncommon analog television standard, the audio for each TV channel is broadcast on a separate frequency band near the video signal frequency band (refer to article NTSC, Transmission modulation scheme). This audio signal can be heard separate from the video, using standard analog FM radios equipped with the appropriate tuning circuits.  Design issues for tuning of digital TV audio  After the relatively recent transition of many countries to digital TV, no radio receiver manufacturer has developed an alternative method to play just the audio portion of digital TV channels.Will TV Band Radios Work with Digital TV?, From Matthew Torres, former About.com Guide http://tv.about.com/od/hdtv/f/tvbandradio.htm (DTV radio is not the same thing but in fact the opposite. The radio signal goes to the television receiver as opposed to the TV audio signal going to the radio receiver.) DTV broadcasters can broadcast multiple separate video programs over one channel frequency in a digital subchannel, so it is necessary for a portable radio equipped with a digital audio decoder to do more than simply tune in to the frequency as with older analog receivers. It also needs to provide a way for the listener to choose among these digital subchannels, usually labeled as *.1, *.2, *.3, etc., on digital televisions with ATSC tuners. This is possible using an analog tuning dial to tune in to a digital TV broadcast, coupled with a button to select the digital subchannel. Direct analog frequency tuning of digital TV is further complicated by the fact that digital TV broadcasting allows the use of virtual channel numbers that are separate from the actual broadcast frequency channel. In this manner, on a fully digital receiver, a station may appear to be on VHF channel 13 but actually broadcasts on UHF channel 33. This complexity is hidden from the users of fully digital receivers, but would be exposed to the user of an analog tuner with a subchannel selector. A fully digital tuning system can hide these complexities from the user, but typically a digital tuner has to perform a special channel scan function to find available digital broadcasts. For a person traveling long distances with a digitally tuned digital TV audio radio, it would be necessary to periodically rescan the available channels to find new stations.

He was the founder of the Schleswig- Holstein-Sonderburg-Plön-Norburg line.  Life  August was the second son of Joachim Ernest and Dorothea Augusta of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp. Although his line was a cadet branch, his son Joachim Frederick would later inherit the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Plön. From 1645 to 1650, Augustus and his brother John Adolphus. who was one year older, made a Grand Tour of European countries, visiting, inter alia, England and France.

On 21 December 1674, he was appointed governor of Minden, as a reward for his bravery in the war against the Ottoman Empire. On 7 July 1676, he received the island of Usedom as a reward for his services in the Scanian War. However, the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye of 1679 awarded Usedom to Sweden. When Elector Frederick William died in 1688, he retired from the brandenburg army and settled at Nordborg Castle. On 29 May 1676 he was awarded the Order of the Elephant in Copenhagen.

Prince Leopold was bred by the Duke of York and raced as a three and four-year-old. The bay colt had an unruly temperament, and was castrated at the end of the 1817 racing season in an attempt to improve his behavior, but he died shortly after the procedure. Background Prince Leopold was bred by the Duke of York and was foaled at the Duke's Oakland Park stud in 1813. His sire, Hedley (foaled in 1803), raced at age four and five, winning a few 100-guinea races before he retired to stud in Wingfield, Berkshire in 1809. Prince Leopold was Hedley's most notable son. Gramarie (foaled 1807), Prince Leopold's dam, was also bred by the Duke of York and produced a full-sister to Prince Leopold, Leopoldine, that became the tail- female ancestress of several French stakes winners, most notably Bois Roussel. Gramarie also produced Bella Donna, the granddam of Derby winner Amato. Racing career and death Prince Leopold did not race as a two-year-old, and he started seven times in his three-year career with a total of two wins and one \\"walk over\\" (win by default). The colt's most important win was in the Derby, and the Duke of York won the Derby a second time in 1822 with the colt Moses. The Duke of York's racing establishment was managed by the Duke's groom, Warwick Lake, and Prince Leopold was registered under Lake's name for most of his racing engagements. 1816: three-year-old season The 1,575-guinea Derby was held on 30 May with 11 horses lining up for the start. The race favorite was the colt Nectar who had won the 2,000 Guineas Stakes. In the final strides of the race, Nectar and Prince Leopold battled for the win, with Prince Leopold winning by half a length. The Duke of York reportedly won several thousand pounds by betting on Prince Leopold to win the Derby. On 1 October at the First October meeting at Newmarket, Prince Leopold was third in the St. Leger Stakes being beaten by the colts Sovereign and Sir Richard. The next day, Prince Leopold received 125 guineas after a subscription race did not attract enough entries (termed as a \\"walk over\\"). On 17 October at the Second October meeting, Prince Leopold was fourth in the second class of the October Oatlands Stakes where the winner was his sire's five-year-old full- brother Wanderer. 1817: four-year-old season and death At the Newmarket- Craven meeting, Prince Leopold won the Port Stakes out of a field of five horses. At the First Spring meeting at Newmarket, Prince Leopold was beaten by Mr. Wyndham's colt Skim in a match race. On 5 May at Newmarket, Nectar beat Prince Leopold in a match race, and he finished third in a 150-guinea sweepstakes race at the same meeting a few days later. Towards the end of the 1817 racing season, Prince Leopold's \\"temper being so bad they could do nothing with him,\\" the decision was made to castrate him. The General Stud Book reports that Prince Leopold died after the operation in 1817, but the Sporting Magazine lists his death year as 1818. The 1817 Racing Calendar reports that Lord Stawell's horse Pandour received a forfeit from Prince Leopold (listed as dead) on 29 September 1817, making the 1817 death date more likely.

Background In 1897, large amounts of gold were discovered in the Yukon, prompting huge numbers of prospectors to travel to the remote region, an event that is known as the Klondike Gold Rush. Belinda Mulrooney, a small-time businesswoman, arrived in Dawson City that year, intending to import goods and establish her own enterprises.Grey, pp.107–109. She established a restaurant and a shop in the city and a business building homes for the immigrant prospectors.Grey, pp.112, 115. Mulrooney began to investigate opportunities outside Dawson City, along the creeks where the gold was being mined and decided that the spot where the Eldorado Creek met the Bonanza Creek would be an ideal place for a roadhouse hotel.Grey, p.115. Structure and operation Mulrooney's new roadhouse was a large, two-story building constructed of logs.Grey, p.116. On the ground floor was a bar and dining room, with the first floor used for accommodation in the form of multiple bunk beds.Grey, p.117. At the rear of the property were kennels for the various husky dogs used for transport in the region. Contractors were brought in from Dawson City to carry out the work, which was complete by August 1897. A separate cabin for Mulrooney was later built nearby. A safe in the hotel was used to store the gold typically used as money amongst the prospecting community.Grey, p.118. The timbers used to build the hotel shrunk over time, however, resulting in a numerous gaps emerging in the structure.Grey, p.163. The Grand Forks Hotel provided food, drink and accommodation to the local and visiting community.Grey, p.160. Despite chronic shortages during the winter months of the gold rush, Mulrooney was able to keep the hotel suitably stocked, with a dinner costing $3.50 and accommodation and food charged at $12; the drinks and cigars served were the most expensive in the region.Grey, p.161; Berton, p.175. Typical meals included bacon and beans and canned meats, with moose heart and pickled nose of moose served on special occasions.Grey, p.161. The roadhouse also doubled as a trading post, a centre for storing gold and a church.Grey, p.162.

It closed in 1957, after graduating its last class in 1956. Establishment Stuart Robinson School was established in 1913 by Rev. Dr. Edward O. Guerrant. A physician and evangelist, Guerrant was the founder of several schools and churches in eastern Kentucky. Guerrant is said to have been inspired to start a mission in Blackey after he encountered some boys swimming in the nearby river on a Sunday morning in 1910 and discovered that most of the boys had never heard of Sunday school, much less attended one. The school was named for Rev. Stuart Robinson, who had been a pastor of Louisville Second Presbyterian Church. Robinson was known for both his leadership role among border state Presbyterians during and after the Civil War and his interest in mission work in the mountains of eastern Kentucky. The school had 140 students when it opened. Campus and facilities The school was located on a campus served by the Rockhouse Branch of the L&N; Railroad and by Kentucky Route 15. It also maintained a large farm to produce food for the school. School and farm buildings included dormitories and a dining hall, educational buildings, a library, a gymnasium, houses for teachers, and a dairy barn, silo, and milk house with equipment for pasteurization and refrigeration. By its final years, the campus expanded from 16 to . School program Stuart Robinson School was coeducational and operated as a day and boarding school with twelve grades. Most students were enrolled in a work-study program, which the school called its \\"Work Scholarship plan\\", through which students could earn all or part of the cost of their education and board. Boys typically did farm and gardening work, installed fencing, fired the school's furnaces, worked at carpentry, or maintained plumbing and electrical wiring. Girls did cooking and housekeeping work in the school's kitchen, dining room and dormitories. The school fielded interscholastic teams in football and basketball. Extracurricular activities included a glee club, a home economics club, and literary societies. Throughout its history, the school operated as a Presbyterian mission. In 1935 it was described as the Presbyterian church's largest school. Closure The school closed after Letcher County built public schools in the nearby community of Letcher. It graduated its last class in 1956 and closed in 1957, after which time the Southern Presbyterian Church sold the property. The school property is now used as Calvary Campus, a Christian camp, education facility, and retreat center. Alumni A school fundraising pamphlet stated that more than half of Stuart Robinson's graduates went on to college, and that many later returned to mountain communities in eastern Kentucky \\"to teach school to their lesser-enlightened neighbors\\" and sometimes \\"organized Sunday Schools where they have never before existed.\\" Notable alumni of the Stuart Robinson School include Juanita Kreps, U.S. Secretary of Commerce under President Jimmy Carter, and Gurney Norman, author and university professor whose novel Divine Right's Trip was published in serial form in the Whole Earth Catalog.

History  The castle would have been built in the mid-12th century during German settlement – probably on the site of a Slavic marsh castle. Its builder is likely to have been Margrave Conrad I of Meißen. The castle is first mentioned in 1209. Until 1382 the lords of Strehla were resident at the castle. They were succeeded by the lords of Bieberstein. In 1518 Ulrich of Bieberstein enfeoffed the castle to the Bishop of Lebus, Dietrich of Bülow. The castle was then expanded into an episcopal Residenz. In 1538, Stefan Meiße, a friend and comrade-in-arms of Hans Kohlhase, was tortured to death at the castle. In 1555 the last Roman Catholic bishop of Lebus, John VIII of Horneburg (1551 – 1555), died here. In 1556 the castle and lordship went to Margrave John of Brandenburg-Küstrin. After his death the castle and estate finally ended up in the possession of the electors of Brandenburg. In 1627, during the Thirty Years' War, the castle was badly damaged It was rebuilt as a small Renaissance residence, but suffered more damage, this time by fire, in 1775. In 1910, the architect Johann Emil Schaudt bought the site and had it remodelled in a Romanesque historic style. Between 1934 and 1945, it was used as a Hitler Youth centre (a Jugendburg). From 1945 to 1978, municipal offices were housed in the castle. In 1978 the site was destroyed by a major fire. Between 2000 and 2009 the building was gradually rebuilt. The re-inauguration of the castle took place at Pentecost in 2009 as part of the 800th anniversary celebrations of the town of Storkow. Since May 2009 the visitor information centre for the Dahme- Heideseen Nature Park has been located at Storkow Castle. In addition to the permanent exhibition entitled \\"People and Nature - a Journey Through Time\\" about the nature and environment in the nature park, there are also changing exhibitions.

It supports Grim Fandango, Myst III: Exile and The Longest Journey. ResidualVM was originally designed to play LucasArts adventure games that use the GrimE game engine. On May 26, 2009, ResidualVM was adapted so that it could support multiple engines. The Sprint engine from Presto Studios is now recreated in ResidualVM as well. Various other engines are in preliminary stages, but have not yet been added to the main branch. Like its sister project, the 2D adventure game interpreter ScummVM, the VM in ResidualVM stands for virtual machine. ResidualVM is a reimplementation of the part of the software used to interpret the scripting languages by conducting reverse engineering on the original game rather than emulating the hardware on which the games ran. As such, ResidualVM allows the games it supports to be played on platforms other than those for which they were originally released. History The logo used until July 2009 The logo used from July 2009 to January 2012 The name of the project comes from the fact that it was originally started to support the residual LucasArts adventure games not supported by ScummVM. The original Lua- based engine used by LucasArts in their 3D adventure games was called GrimE (as opposed to SCUMM), so ResidualVM's title is also a word pun as grime is a type of residue. The project was started by former ScummVM team leader James Brown, and was first publicly available on August 15, 2003. Progress on the project was initially slow, and as a result the project's main goal of supporting Grim Fandango did not occur until April 25, 2011, when the compatibility of Grim Fandango was upgraded to \\"completable with a few minor glitches\\".. The project obtained a domain separate from ScummVM on December 6, 2011. As a result of the new domain name, the project name was changed from Residual to ResidualVM. The logo was changed to reflect the new name on January 25, 2012. The first stable release of ResidualVM was released 9 years after the project started, on December 21, 2012.. By late 2020, however, it was announced ResidualVM is officially merging with ScummVM. Support ResidualVM is officially available on multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, AmigaOS 4, and IRIX. In addition, an Android port is available in the source code, and unofficial builds have been made with that source. There is also a port available for the Pandora console, and for FreeBSD, but they are not official as they have not been added to the main branch. Developer support With increased attention, ResidualVM has entered into favorable agreements with adventure game developers to help bring their titles into the engine. Cyan Worlds partnered with ResidualVM to release Myst III: Exile on digital platforms. The digital storefront GOG.com which specializes in selling digital copies of older games, sells Myst III: Exile with the ResidualVM engine as part of its distribution. Supported games The stable release supports Grim Fandango and Myst III: Exile, which are completable with a few minor glitches. In the development branch, there is also support for Escape from Monkey Island, which is completable with a few glitches, and The Longest Journey, which is completable with missing features. Like ScummVM, ResidualVM contains fixes for bugs present in the original executable. The ResidualVM team discovered a workaround for a bug that causes a critical dialog not to play in Grim Fandango. In addition, the Grim Fandango engine in ResidualVM has fixes for over a dozen other bugs present in the original. There is also a branch of ResidualVM called Grim Mouse, which allows Grim Fandango to be played completely with a mouse as a traditional point and click adventure game.

Included as one of Aesop's Fables and numbered 181 in the Perry Index,Aesopica site its Greek sources also include a donkey and a mule, while the story is told of an ox and a donkey in the Mediaeval Latin version of Ademar. In the former the overburdened donkey asks its companion for help in carrying its load and dies when this is refused; the other is then forced to carry not only the original load but the dead animal's skin as well. In Ademar's story the two animals are yoked together but the ass refuses to pull its weight; when the ox dies of the strain, the ass is forced to continue pulling and also dies. There are references to the fable in two other texts six centuries apart. The Aramaic collection of wise sayings by Ahiqar, dating from 500 BCE, mentions that 'An ass which leaves its load and does not carry it shall take a load from its companion and take the burden which is not its [own with its own] and shall be made to bear a camel's load.'The Words of Ahiqar The historian Plutarch has a version in which an ox and a camel feature where, 'as the ox said to his fellow-servant the camel, when he refused to ease him of his burthen, It won’t be long before you carry my burthen and me too: which fell out to be true, when the ox died.' The fable does not appear in William Caxton's collection of Aesop's Fables although it does in later English compilations. La Fontaine's Fables further popularised the story as \\"The Horse and the Ass\\".VI.16 This begins with the moral that is usually put into the mouth of the remaining animal in Classical versions: :::Neighbours here should each other aid, :::For if one dies, it’s on your back :::His burden surely shall be laid.

Counsel for the appellant was MD Kuper SC (with H. van Eeden); PM Wulfsohn SC (with T. Ossin) appeared for the respondents.  Facts  The respondents sued the appellant bank in a Local Division for damages arising out of the theft of the contents of a safe deposit box provided at a small annual fee by the bank for Rosenblum's use. First National Bank (FNB) sought to avoid liability on the ground that a term of the contract for the provision of the box expressly excluded liability. The relevant term (clause 2) provided that, while the bank \\"will exercise every reasonable care, it is not liable for any loss or damage caused to any article lodged with it for safe custody whether by theft, rain, flow of storm water, wind, hail, lightning, fire, explosion, action of the elements or as a result of any cause whatsoever, including war or riot damage and whether the loss or damage is due to the bank's negligence or not.\\" The stated case prepared in the matter placed it beyond doubt that one or more of FNB's staff had stolen the safe deposit box or allowed one or more third parties to steal it. In doing so, the staff had acted with negligence or even gross negligence regarding the control of the keys which safeguarded the place where the box was kept, making it possible for the theft to take place. Although loss caused by theft or negligence had specifically been enumerated in the relevant clause excluding the bank's liability, the respondents contended that not all the possible manifestations of theft were covered by the clause. Theft by the bank's employees, acting within the course and scope of their employment, was not covered. The respondents contended further that gross negligence and negligent acts or omissions committed by the bank's employees had not been excluded. The respondents argued that the clause was silent as to by whom the theft had to be committed before the bank would be immune from a claim. It could not have been intended to mean that the bank would not be liable even if it was the bank itself that stole in the sense that those who were the \\"controlling minds\\" of the bank had committed the theft. This was so, the respondents argued, because no one could contract out of liability for deliberately committed dishonest acts. Relying on the eiusdem generis rule, they further argued that the clause dealt only with causes of loss beyond the control of the bank. As theft by employees acting in the course and within the scope of their employment was something over which the bank did have control, theft by such persons was not within the protection against liability provided by the clause. The respondents contended that the additional phrase \\"or as a result of any cause whatsoever\\" did not serve to expand the protection offered by the clause to encompass any other cause, whatever its nature. The phrase should be interpreted restrictively to read, \\"or as a result of any cause whatsoever over which the bank has no control.\\" The Local Division concluded that FNB was not entitled to rely on the specific term in its defence of the action. FNB appealed against this finding.  Judgment  The SCA held that, in matters of contract, the parties are taken to have intended their legal rights and obligations to be governed by the common law unless they have plainly and unambiguously indicated the contrary. Therefore, even where an exclusionary clause is couched in language sufficiently wide to be capable of excluding liability for a negligent failure to fulfil a contractual obligation, or for a negligent act or omission, it would not be regarded as doing so if there was another realistic and not fanciful basis of potential liability to which the clause could apply and so have a field of meaningful application. In the end, however, the answer had to be found in the language of the clause read in the context of the agreement as a whole in its commercial setting, and against the background of the common law with due regard to any constitutional implication.Paras 6, 7. The assemblage of causes of loss or damage contained in the relevant clause, the court determined, consisted of an unrelated collection of phenomena, some which were natural and the occurrence of which were beyond human control, and some which emanated from human conduct. While the occurrence of the natural phenomena was not preventable, the damaging consequences of their occurrence could be prevented by taking adequate measures. If there was negligence in averting the damaging consequences contrary to a duty in law to do so, the bank would be liable at common law for the ensuing loss, even though it had no control over the occurrence of those phenomena. Similarly, the breadth of the phrase \\"or as a result of any cause whatsoever\\" could not be narrowed so as to exclude liability only for causes beyond the control of the bank.Paras 12, 13. Although there was no direct reference to the bank's employees in the relevant clause, it seemed obvious to the court that they were included in it. If the exemption from liability accorded by the clause were to be construed as being confined to cases in which only the acts and omissions of those who were identified as the \\"controlling or directing minds\\" of the bank were involved, the potential field of operation of the exemption would be so slight as not to have been worth the bank's while to insist on it. This would have left FNB entirely unprotected against liability stemming from the potential negligence or dishonesty of many thousands of employees. The bank, as an artificial, non- human entity, was obviously incapable of being negligent itself in fact. The negligence of the human beings acting as the bank's controlling minds was attributed to the bank; it could also be held vicariously liable for the negligence of ordinary employees acting in the course and within the scope of their employment. When the bank said that it was not liable \\"whether the loss or damage was due to the bank's negligence or not,\\" it included loss or damage due to the negligence of its employees.Paras 17, 18. Furthermore, the clause provided quite plainly that, even if the loss or damage was due to the bank's own negligence, attributed to it as a result of the negligence of its controlling minds or its employees, it was still immune from liability.Para 23. The court found nothing in clause 2 to suggest that only culpa levis, but not culpa lata, was to enjoy immunity; the immunity extended to gross negligence.Para 26. Accordingly, the court ruled that the relevant clause exempted the bank from liability * for theft committed by its own employees in the course and within scope of their employment; * for failing to exercise reasonable care and so negligently rendering it possible for the theft to take place; and * for the negligence or gross negligence of its staff, acting in the course of and within the scope of their employment, regarding control of the keys to the place where the safe deposit box was kept, so rendering it possible for the theft to take place. The claims of the respondents ought accordingly to have been dismissed.Paras 27, 28. The appeal was thus allowed and the decision in the Witwatersrand Local Division, in Rosenblum and Another v First National Bank of SA Ltd, reversed.

History Noxville has actually had two locations in the area. Old Noxville was the site of the 1879 post office, begun by Noah Nox (also Knox), in his general store on the Little Devil's River. His wife Persis was the first postmaster. When James Milam became the postmaster in 1911, he moved the post office and town to the west side of the James River. Among the first nonindigenous residents of the area in addition to Nox were farmers and ranchers Creed Taylor, Munroe McDonald, and James H. Parker. Parker was originally from Alabama and settled in the area at the end of the Civil War. He had been a second lieutenant in the 30th Texas Cavalry and eventually owned 12,000 acres in the area. He donated the land for the old school house. Taylor retired to Noxville after the death of his first wife, and after a career of military service to Texas. In Kimble County, he remarried and remained in Noxville the rest of his life. Noxville had a native limestone school that remained in use until just prior to World War II. After the close of the school, students were then schooled at nearby Harper. The old Noxville school house remained as a voting precinct into the 21st century. The McDonald homestead and barn, the John New home and post office, and the James H. Parker home are still occupied by descendants of original settlers. The Noxville cemetery is still in use. Noxville and the Little Devils River crossing were on the Great Western Cattle Trail and were the first leg out of Kerrville for over 5 million Longhorns and a million horses from 1874 to 1885. A marker for the trail is in front of the old post office. As of the Census of 2000, Noxville had a population of three people.

Lee Unkrich, a film director with Pixar, explains that the production team and film crew indelibly associate the birth of each of their children with the film they were working on at the time. The listing in the end credits becomes a way for them to share these essential memories more widely. \\"It's like our family lives are permanently woven into the movies.\\" Twists added in film credits include a list of \\"Chameleon Kids\\" at the end of the 2010 animated film Tangled, born to the real-life model for the pet in the film. The 2011 animated film Winnie the Pooh lists the names under \\"Pooh Babies\\", with the credit knitted on a scarf by the character Kanga. Disney film director Byron Howard cites the listing of production babies as a pointer to the depth of personal relationships established during collaboration on an animated movie. A star next to a baby's name honors a baby who died before production was complete. One example can be found in the end credits of Moana for a baby named Cooper. In 2009, Ari Folman dedicated his Golden Globe Award to the eight production babies born during the making of Waltz with Bashir, an animated anti-war documentary, and expressed hope that their lives would have no contact with the realities of conflict depicted in the film. Reviewers have noted that \\"production babies\\" credits indicate the creativity of film people in giving some unusual names to their children. An early, isolated instance in video games occurred with an easter egg message embedded in the ROM for the 1988 game Spiker! Super Pro Volleyball for Mattel Intellivision. The modern custom spread to video game credits in the 2005 game Call of Duty 2, and the 2009 game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which also listed the other parents. The title of the list was changed to \\"Development Babies\\" in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. A number of other games have since done the same.

Within northeast Box Elder County, the southwest of the valley abuts the Locomotive Springs Wildlife Management Area and an extensive salt flat on the edge of the Great Salt Lake. Description The Curlew Valley trends southwest to northeast with Deep Creek towards the valley's west. At the valley's northeast, Deep Creek turns east, then almost due north into Idaho, meeting the unincorporated community of Stone and the south border of the Curlew National Grassland. Adjacent to Stone, upstream and south is the townsite of Snowville, Utah on Interstate 84 which traverses the valley diagonally from northwest (Idaho), by southeast. The route goes through the divide between the Hansel Mountains (south), and the North Hansel Mountains and continues southeast through the Blue Creek Valley, the south West Hills and continues on to Brigham City. The Curlew Valley center is slightly east-southeast of Coyote Springs, on Deep Creek. A mountain peak, Cedar Hill lies adjacent eastwards, .Utah, DeLorme Atlas & Gazetteer, p. 10. Directly west, and south of Coyote Springs lies another peak, Wildcat Hills, . Rose Ranch Reservoir At the northeast of the valley, the Stone Hills force Deep Creek to transect east; here, about west and southwest of Snowville is the Rose Ranch Reservoir, formed on Deep Creek. History Curlew Valley Settler's Bell at the Snowville City Park. Curlew Valley, named after the curlew snipe that nests there. The first recorded white men were Peter Skene Ogden's large party of trappers that camped on Deep Creek December 27, 1828. Some of the discharged members of the Mormon Battalion, on their way home from California to Salt Lake City on September 18, 1848, camped on Deep Creek and also in a cave east called Hollow Rock. The beginning of Deep Creek is a large spring at Holbrook which runs through the center of the valley and has never varied even in dry years. About southwest is Rocky Ford, where the pioneers were able to pass on solid rock. In 1869 William Robbins, Thomas Showell, and William M. Harris settled at the Curlew Sinks, west of here, where Deep Creek sinks into the ground. The old pioneer trail and the stage line went through their ranch. The first townsite in the Curlew Valley was Snowville. Settled at the direction of Brigham Young and named in honor of Lorenzo Snow: an apostle at the time, but later to become the 5th President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 1898–1901. Snowville was laid out August 14, 1878.

She was launched on 1 July 1893 at Toulon, France, although only formally entering service with the French Navy in May 1900 after a long series of trials and design alterations. The submarine carried out the first successful torpedo attack by a submerged vessel against a surface ship. Initially ordered as Sirène on 4 October 1890 the boat was renamed Gustave Zédé on 1 May 1891 after the French naval architect who had worked on its design, but who died in 1891 following an explosion during the development of an experimental torpedo. Development followed on from the previous smaller design, . Both ships were electrically propelled using power from storage batteries. Development The French Navy had become interested in unconventional approaches to naval warfare in its attempts to face the numerically superior Royal Navy, and was an early adopter of the torpedo and torpedo boat for use against battleships. As part of this program, they became interested in the submarine, able to approach undetected to within torpedo range. Gustave Zédé was the second experimental submarine developed for the French Navy.Lambert p.24-27 The ship's principal constructor was Gaston Romazotti who took control of the project after the death of Zédé in 1891. Construction and development took ten years, in part because interest in submarines in the French Navy came and went with the changing policies of different ministers of marine, and because of ongoing development of the design during this time. Characteristics The hull was made of bronze rather than steel to resist corrosion, which also allowed a magnetic compass to operate inside. It had a different profile fore and aft, unlike other submarines at this time which tended to be the same shape either end. Seventy- six longitudinal round ribs provided the strength of the hull. The boat had two centrally placed ballast tanks and trimming tanks at either end. Electric pumps were used to redistribute the water. There was a detachable central lead keel. The ship was initially fitted with manually operated diving rudder at the stern as in the design of , but proved difficult to maintain level or on a steady incline while diving or rising. Hydraulic hydroplanes were therefore added at the center of the ship and forwards. The ship was designed to dive to a depth of 50 ft. A periscope was fitted in the conning tower which gave a field of view 20° above and 7° below the horizon but the view was distorted and of limited use.Compton-Hall p.118 The boat was electrically driven with power supplied by a bank of batteries. Two 360 hp Sauter-Harlé DC electric motors were coupled to the single propeller drive shaft operating at 250 rpm. Together the motors weighed 27 tons. The original Laurant-Celvieva battery configuration was of 720 cells weighing 130 tons capable of delivering 1800A at 300V. The battery system exploded on first charging causing a fire, so a new layout of only 360 cells was installed. This led to a significant reduction of surface speed from 15 to 8 knots. The boat had no alternative power source on board which could be used to recharge the batteries, unlike other contemporary designs such as the Holland VI design which had a petrol engine as well as batteries. Service history Gustave Zédé underway In December 1898 Gustave Zédé took part in naval exercises with the Mediterranean fleet commanded by Admiral François Fournier. The submarine successfully twice attacked the gunnery training ship , once at anchor and once while the battleship was underway, after travelling the forty miles from Toulon to the Îles d'Hyères. Gustave Zédé was commanded by Lieutenant Lucian Mottez. This was the first recorded successful attack by a submerged submarine using torpedoes against a surface target and was widely reported in naval circles.Lambert p.27-28 The British Naval Attaché reported that Gustave Zédé was observed approaching Magenta at a speed of and a distance of with four men on the bridge. The submarine then submerged until only the conning tower was visible. At the conning tower had disappeared but some wash from the screw could be observed. The boat then submerged to a depth of . At the ship came to the surface momentarily to check her distance and course, before diving again and firing a torpedo at a range of , striking Magenta amidships. The submarine passed under the ship and resurfaced on the opposite side.Compton-Hall p.118-119 The exercise was repeated early in 1899 in front of the French Minister of Marine and invited journalists. The successful demonstration resulted in further funding to purchase more submarines for the French Navy.

The director of the museum was a regular visitor of the restaurant and found that the front needed to be preserved for historical reasons. He could justify that because of sign of the Koninklijke Nederlandsche Automobiel Club (Royal Dutch Automobile Club) adjacent to the front door. Banquetmap House of Lord http://www.houseoflords.nl/download/Eeuwig-Den-Haag-.pdf Due to the large number of parliamentarians frequenting the restaurant, it was also the place for politic intrigue. The most known case is that of Wim Keja, who was approached in the restaurant to speak out in favour the Dassault Mirage F1. He was offered 30.000 Dutch guilder. Keja declined. History The original building was one of the eldest in The Hague. It was mentioned in 1595 as \\"Huys Teijlingen aan de oostpoort van het hoff\\" (Eng.: House Teijlingen on the eastern gate of the castle). In 1628, it was renamed to \\"De Gouden Leeuw\\" (Eng.: The Golden Lion) by Waltherus van der Beek. In 1917 the restaurant got the name The House of Lords, on request of interned British officers.

Somerset worked on the college with Thomas Morstede and Gilbert Kymer until its plans collapsed in November 1424. In 1427 he was found a place in the royal household as physician and tutor to the young Henry VI. In 1442 he became the first medical man to sit in parliament, as a knight of the shire for Middlesex. In 1439 he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer and Warden of the Royal Mint. Somerset's tenure as Chancellor and Warden occurred during the Great Bullion Famine and the Great Slump in England.

It was commissioned by Gregorio Correr, the abbot of that monastery. History The Crucifixion was brought to the Louvre in 1798 and put on exhibition immediately. In 1806 two of the predella panels (the Mount of Olives and the Resurrection) were sent to the museum of Tours. In 1815 the central panel and the two wings were taken back to Italy and exhibited in the city museum at Verona. After 1918, they were returned to the church of San Zeno, where they still remain - though they are not very easy to see. The commission of 1815 charged with reclaiming the works of art taken from the Veneto left the predella panels in the possession of the Louvre and the museum of Tours.M. Cruttwel, Andrea Mantegna, BiblioBazaar (2009), pp.43ff. The complete altarpiece by Mantegna (1457-1459) The Crucifixion was in the middle of the predella, exactly in the centre, as may be seen in the full altarpiece image below. Mantegna was striving after an effect of steep visual perspective such as he had already achieved in the Eremitani chapel at Padua.G. Fiocco, The frescoes of Mantegna in the Eremitani Church, Padua, Phaidon (1978). The figures in the foreground, cut by the frame, increase the effect of recession; the vanishing lines of the ground are curved inwards and somehow contracted. The artist's feeling for nature is revealed by the minuteness with which he has represented every detail of the landscape. The accurate delineation of the Roman soldiers' equipment is evidence of an attitude to antiquity unknown in Florence at that period.R.W. Lightbown, Andrea Mantegna: With a Complete Catalogue of the Paintings, Drawings, and Prints, University of California Press (1992), s.v. Crucifixion. Florentine artists sought to understand and emulate the aesthetic quality of antique sculpture and architecture, but cared little for historical exactitude, which Mantegna on the other hand pursued with the passionate devotion of an archaeologist. In fact, the Veneto was from the 14th century onwards, the chief Italian centre for the traffic in anticaglie - Venetian towns owned cabinets d'antiquités long before these were found in Florence.S.

It was self-released as a free digital download on March 7, 2011. It features instrumentals of tracks that he produced for various rappers, including some bonus songs. In July 2011, Instrumentals was reissued by Type Records as a physical release.  Music  Instrumentals consists of Clams Casino's reconstructions of backing tracks he originally produced for rappers such as Lil B and Soulja Boy. An electronic mixtape, it features illbient, glitchbeat, and chillwave styles. Some of the mixtape explores a more traditional hip hop sound. Its second half touches on bouncy basslines (\\"She's Hot\\"), dubstep- influenced, low-end grind (\\"Brainwash by London\\"), and vocal looping similar to the production of Kanye West (\\"Cold War\\"). Instrumentals appropriates Casino's previous hip hop beats into moody compositions, which are characterized by melodramatic drum crescendos and melancholic electronic sounds.  Critical reception  In a review for Resident Advisor, Andrew Ryce called Instrumentals \\"a collection of aching, blown-out paeans to wonder, sadness and profound joy—music that any of the above could fall in love with.\\" Pitchfork critic Brandon Soderberg said Casino's \\"attention to hip-hop structure ... makes these beats so emotionally devastating.\\" Rory Gibb from The Quietus felt that, without the rappers they were originally produced for, the instrumentals are \\"revealed as intricate enough to stand alone in their own right\\", while sounding \\"ephemeral and peculiarly of this moment, phantom aggregations of mood and sound that coalesce for brief periods of time before potentially disengaging at some undisclosed point in the future.\\" Sputnikmusic's Conrad Tao felt that, although Instrumentals sounds occasionally conventional, Casino's approach to sampling is \\"refreshingly abstract\\". He went on to write that the mixtape basically serves as \\"a hugely enticing teaser for what promises to be an illustrious career filled with sumptuous, bittersweet music.\\" Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau said Casino's \\"comfortably disquieting\\" sound \\"will grow on you if you give it a chance.

Origins The word \\"Shakespeare festival\\" may have originated from the professional company operating out of Stratford-upon-Avon in the late 19th century. From 1886 to 1919, Frank Benson directed 28 spring and six summer \\"Shakespeare festivals\\" at the original Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford.\\"Shakespeare For All Time\\", by Stanley Wells, 2002; pg. 321 In 1935 the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, or OSF, was founded in Ashland, Oregon, USA. Originally named the \\"Oregon Shakespearean Festival\\"; the name was changed in 1988. Angus L. Bowmer, founder of OSF, wrote in 1954 that Shakespeare Festivals have in common the following attributes: 1) established firmly in one place; 2) repertoire (staging a variety of Shakespeare plays) and 3) a physical stage similar to that used in Shakespeare's lifetime.Oregon Shakespearean Association Fourteenth Season program, 1954, pg 3-4 According to Bowmer, the inspiration for Elizabethan staging of contemporary Shakespeare productions came from William Poel, an English director who organized the Elizabethan Stage Society in London in the early 20th century. His concepts of Elizabethan staging were brought to North America by Ben Iden Payne. Other early Shakespeare festivals in North America staged on replicas of the Globe Theatre include the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego (1937) and the Hofstra Shakespeare Festival, launched at Hofstra University in 1950. The American Shakespeare Theatre operated on a festival stage in Stratford, Connecticut, United States from 1955 to the 1980s. Arthur Lithgow, father of actor John Lithgow, founded the \\"Antioch Shakespeare Festival\\" (also known as Shakespeare Under the Stars\\") at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio in 1952. In its five years of existence, the Festival performed the entire Shakespeare canon. In 1953, the Stratford Shakespeare Festival was founded in the Canadian city of Stratford, Ontario, with Tyrone Guthrie as the festival's first Artistic Director.

It premiered in the United States on The CW Television Network on September 9, 2010. The episode was written by series creator Craig Silverstein and directed by Danny Cannon. This episode introduces the series' main characters and the motivation behind the title character Nikita's mission to bring down a secret agency in the government called Division. \\"Pilot\\" received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It was watched by 3.6 million viewers and earned a 1.9 rating for women 18-34, matching the CW's highest rating ever in the Thursday 9:00pm timeslot and drawing the largest audience that the CW had had in over a year and a half. Plot After escaping from a secret unit of the government known as Division three years ago, Nikita (Maggie Q) suddenly resurfaces when she visits her abusive foster father Gary (David Ferry) and tells him what happened to her after she had run away from his house as a teenager. She became addicted to drugs, and six years ago, she reportedly killed a police officer, though she cannot remember whether she did so or not. She was sentenced to death, but Division faked her execution and trained her to be an assassin. However, she broke one of their rules by falling in love with a civilian, Daniel Monroe (Sebastien Roberts). Division had Daniel killed in what appeared to be an accident, and this prompted Nikita to escape. Nikita explains all of this to Gary, knowing full well that doing so would alert Division to her presence. Meanwhile, in Detroit, Alex (Lyndsy Fonseca) is captured by the police during a failed robbery, while her accomplice escapes. Shortly after being brought to prison, Alex wakes up to find herself inside Division. Michael (Shane West), Division's second-in-command, informs Alex that they have faked her death and that she is being offered a second chance - an opportunity to serve her government. She soon meets two other recruits, Thom (Ashton Holmes) and Jaden (Tiffany Hines), as well as Amanda (Melinda Clarke), Division's psychologist who also assists in training the recruits. Amanda guesses correctly that Alex had been smuggled to the US after being sold to human traffickers in Ukraine. Percy (Xander Berkeley), the head of Division gets wind of Nikita's reemergence and assigns Michael to kill her. Nikita once again gets Division's attention by visiting Daniel's grave. A strike team is sent to go after her, but, during the attack, Nikita captures Birkhoff (Aaron Stanford), Division's head technician. She demands that he give her access to Division's computer network. Even though he doesn't comply, she lets Birkhoff return to Division unharmed. In spite of Nikita, Percy decides to go ahead with all of Division's operations, including Operation Black Arrow, in which the head of a West African nation is targeted for assassination. Nikita learns about Black Arrow from an unknown source and sabotages the mission. Nikita then comes face-to-face with Percy and Michael at a government fundraiser and tells Percy of her intentions to destroy Division. Michael chases her out of the building and has the opportunity to kill her, but he hesitates. He tells Nikita that Percy cannot be stopped because he has evidence of every illegal Division operation ever done and that this information would irreparably damage the US government. Michael decides to let Nikita escape, but she shoots him in the shoulder before running off, claiming that she is protecting him since the wound would make it look like he tried to stop her. Percy immediately names Nikita Division's priority target and believes that she is working with someone who is giving her information on Division's operations. It is revealed that Alex is Nikita's source inside Division and that Nikita was Alex's accomplice during the robbery that resulted in Alex's recruitment into Division. Production The episode was written by developer and executive producer Craig Silverstein, while being directed by CSI: Crime Scene Investigation veteran Danny Cannon. Reception Ratings Premiering in the Thursday 9:00pm timeslot after The Vampire Diaries, the pilot episode of Nikita matched the CW's all-time best ratings in that time period among women 18-34 (1.9/5) and was viewed by the CW's largest audience in over a year and a half with approximately 3.6 million viewers. This debut also improved upon the season premiere of Supernatural in the same timeslot a year earlier. The CW aired a repeat of \\"Pilot\\" the next day, which earned a rating of 0.8 for adults 18-49 with 2.61 million viewers. Reviews \\"Pilot\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics and drew comparisons to earlier incarnations of Nikita in the TV series La Femme Nikita, the French film by Luc Besson, and the American remake. Metacritic reports that the episode garnered an average score of 66 out of 100 from critics, which is considered \\"Generally favourable\\", with mostly positive and mixed reviews. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly praised the show, saying, \\"Slick in the best way, Nikita is a fresh new take on the gorgeous-but- agonized-assassin character.\\" New York Times reporter Alessandra Stanley commended Nikita as \\"surprisingly sophisticated and satisfying\\" and called it \\"darker and more hard-nosed\\" than La Femme Nikita.

The game is themed on the Battle of Jericho described in the Book of Joshua, in which the Israelites topple the defensive wall of the city of Jericho by encircling it and blowing their trumpets. As a tile-based action puzzle game, Joshua & the Battle of Jericho was one of the few Christian video games of its day that did not adhere strictly to a Bible quiz format. However, between game levels the player is asked five multiple choice questions about the Book of Joshua. In 1992, Wisdom Tree published the game in the United States for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and later ported it to Game Boy (1993), MS-DOS (1994), and Sega Genesis (1994). Design and gameplay The game is a redesign of Crystal Mines (1989), a title developed by Ken Beckett for Wisdom Tree's predecessor, Color Dreams. In addition to changes in theme, graphics, and game mechanics, Joshua introduces a password feature for revisiting a game level. The game has 100 levels, 100 quizzes, and 10 bonus stages. Unlike Crystal Mines, the game has no background music. Whereas in Crystal Mines the player character is a gun-wielding robot who mines a newly discovered exoplanet, Joshua is a tribal leader of Israel who infiltrates and pillages the city of Jericho. He attacks enemies and destroys obstacles with blasts from a shofar (a Jewish ceremonial horn). Enemies include Amorites, Hittites, and other Canaanites; BalaamIn the books of Joshua and Numbers, Balaam is a prophet who is slain when Reubenites invade Moab. features as a slightly more powerful enemy. Joshua's trumpet blasts (called \\"toots\\" in-game) also destroy blocks of Jericho's wall; \\"Israelite discontent\\", \\"Achan's sin\\", and \\"foreign idols\\" (cult images) are likewise represented by destructible tiles. The trumpet blasts are symbolized by white quavers. Occasionally, destroying a block with a trumpet blast reveals an item or power-up. All the levels have a time limit. To advance in the game, Joshua must pillage enough gold, silver, brass, and iron to meet the quota for the level. He must also collect five \\"Joshua questions\\". With all these attained, he navigates to the exit. The obstacles to these goals are movable boulders, immovable barriers, destructible objects, enemy soldiers, citizens, goats, et al. After each game level (including the final one) is a Bible quiz. By correctly answering trivia questions about the Book of Joshua (and other books such as Numbers and Deuteronomy), the player earns Bibles. The game advances even if the player answers questions incorrectly.

It is a volunteer-run museum containing various artifacts collected by the historical society along with an extensive library and photo collection. It is open to the public and local schools for educational purposes.  History  The museum was initially a mansion built in 1818 by James McClurg, the son of a wealthy Pittsburgh industrialist. It is said McClurg baked the bricks, prepared the lumber and brought bricklayers from Pittsburgh to construct the building, which was dubbed by locals “McClurg’s Folly” because of its large rooms and high ceilings, which stood in high contrast to the crude log cabins around it. For two years during its history, the mansion was the residence of William H. Seward - who would later become the 12th Governor of New York, a U.S. Senator, and Secretary of State under Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. From 1836 to 1838, Seward served as one of the owners and Land Agent for the newly established Chautauqua Land Company, after the agency negotiated acquisition of property and deeds from the Holland Land Company. This acquisition was an indirect result of the \\"Settlers Revolt\\" of 1836. While working to ease tensions with the local landowners, Seward made the mansion his home. In 1950, the Chautauqua County Historical Society obtained a seventy-five year lease from the Village of Westfield to inhabit the mansion. The Society has since restored it and furnished it in nineteenth century style. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.  Chautauqua County Historical Society  The McClurg Museum has been the home of Chautauqua County Historical Society since 1951. The Chautauqua County Historical Society was founded in 1883, making it one of the oldest societies in Western New York State. Since its inception, CCHS has been collecting and preserving the significant history of Chautauqua County, New York. Its mission is to foster an interest in and knowledge of the history of Chautauqua County through the collection, preservation and interpretation of objects and archives of local significance. The Research Library contains several important collections, including the Elial T. Foote collection, the Cushing family papers(Alonzo Cushing and William B. Cushing), the Albion W. Tourgée collection and the John O. Bowman photographic collection. Genealogists reference local history files, including family histories and Civil War documents. The society maintains an active schedule. Members enjoy quarterly programs, special receptions, museum exhibits and a free subscription to TimeLines, the society's award-winning newsletter.

She then traded for a decade before, in 1792, commencing a series of four voyages for the British East India Company as an \\"extra ship\\", that is, on a charter contract. During the first of these voyages she transported convicts from Britain to New South Wales. French privateers captured her and the British Royal Navy recaptured her, the Royal Navy seized her once, and then finally a French privateer captured her in February 1810 and scuttled her. Career EIC voyage #1 (1792-94) Captain Matthew Boyd sailed from Gravesend, England, on 8 August 1792, bound for New South Wales and China. The government chartered Bellona for the voyage, paying £4 4s/ton (bm)/month. Bellona carried 17 female convicts, five free settlers and their families, and a cargo of stores. The free settlers were the first free settlers to come to Australia. Bellona reached Rio de Janeiro on 18 October, and arrived at Port Jackson, New South Wales on 16 January 1793. The stores were five pipes of port wine, some rum, and 3000 lbs of tobacco. Unfortunately, bad weather on the journey had spoilt a large part of the most useful articles. After delivering convicts, settlers, and cargo, Bellona sailed for China on 19 February. On the way, in February–March, Matthew Boyd discovered a reef system near New Caledonia. The Bellona Reefs are named in honour of the ship. Bellona reached Penang on 16 May and Malacca on 23 June, and arrived at Whampoa on 22 July. She was at the Second Bar on 20 December. On 1 January 1794, five East Indiamen set out together, in order: Bombay Castle, Chesterfield, Brunswick, Minerva, and Bellona. Bellona reached St Helena 20 April 1794 and Galway on 20 July, and arrived at Long Reach on 30 August.British Library: Belona. EIC voyage #2 (1795-96) Captain William Ward Farrer left the Downs on 12 July 1795, bound for Bengal. Bellona arrived at Calcutta on 7 December. While he was underway, he was issued a letter of marque on 19 September 1796. This authorized him to take offensive action against the French or their allies, not just defensive. On the return leg of her voyage, Bellona passed Saugor on 3 February 1796, reached the Cape on 18 April and St Helena on 5 May, and arrived at Long Reach on 8 August. EIC voyage #3 (1796-98) Captain William Ward Farrer sailed from the Downs on 3 October 1796, bound for Madras and Amboina. Bellona reached Madras on 12 February 1797, Trincomalee on 11 March, and Pondicherry on 21 March. She returned to Madras on 26 March, reached Malacca on 6 June, and arrived at Amboina on 19 August. She left Amboina on 1 January 1798, reached the Cape on 17 March, St Helena on 15 April, and Cork on 25 June. She arrived at Long Reach on 10 July. Jamaica trader (1799-1800) Lloyd's Register for 1799 gives the name of Bellonas owner as \\"Wddrbrn\\", her master as E. Lamb, and her trade as London-Jamaica.Lloyd's Register (1799), Seq. №B70. Lloyd's List reported on 13 June 1800 that \\"the Bellona, Lamb, has been taken by two French privateers, after an engagement of two hours; since retaken and arrived at Jamaica.\\"Lloyd's List, №4059. The recapture was the work of , which captured the \\"English Ship Bellona, of Ten Guns, and Six Hundred Tons, from London, bound to Saint Lucie\\". EIC voyage #4 (1801-02) Next, her owners tendered Bellona to the EIC to bring back rice from Bengal. Bellona, Edward Lamb, master, was one of 28 vessels that sailed on that mission between December 1800 and February 1801. Captain Edwin Lamb sailed from the Downs on 14 January 1801, bound for Madras and Calcutta. Bellona reached Madras on 17 June and Calcutta on 24 June. Homeward bound, she passed Saugor on 8 September, reached St Helena on 1 January 1802, and arrived at Gravesend on 3 March. On 30 March 1802 the Court of Directors of the United Company of Merchants trading with the East Indies (the EIC), announced that on 22 April they would offer for sale 37,000 bags of rice brought by , , , , and Bellona. Subsequent career Lloyd's Register of 1802 gave her master as \\"Lamb\\", her owner as \\"Boyd & Co.\\", and her trade as London to India. This information continued unchanged through 1804. However, there are accounts that Boyd & Co. sold Bellona to foreign buyers in 1802, but repurchased her in 1804. There may be a related explanation for a break in 1803. The Morning Post, of London, England, reported on 5 November 1803 that: \\"The Batavia, Jansen, and the Bellona, Lamb, from Batavia to Amsterdam, are captured by the Governor of St. Helena.\\" Coming from Batavia, the two vessels may not have realized that war with France and her allies, including the Batavian Republic, had recommenced in May. This would have provided grounds for the seizure of the two vessels as they arrived at St Helena. Lloyd's Register of 1805 gave the name of Bellonas master as \\"Lamb\\", her owner as \\"Boyd & Co.\\", and her trade as London transport. Bellona was one of the transport vessels that were part of the expedition under General Sir David Baird and Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham that would in 1806 capture the Dutch Cape Colony. On 28 February she and six other transports sailed as cartels, repatriating Dutch prisoners to Holland. The Caledonian Mercury reported on 8 September 1806 that \\"The Bellona, transport, Lamb, has been on shore at Plymouth, and received damage.\\" Fate On 28 February 1810, the French privateer captured Bellona, Ross, master, at as Bellona was sailing from London to Amelia Island, Florida. The French set their prize on fire, scuttling her; Invincible Napoleon carried the crew into Bordeaux.Lloyd's List №4460.

Metzenbaum, President, Volcker Alliance Shelley H. Metzenbaum (born March 18, 1952) was the President of the Volcker Alliance in New York City, New York, United states Personal life Dr. Metzenbaum is a native of Ohio. Her late father, Howard Metzenbaum, was a U.S. Senator. She is the third of four daughters. Dr. Metzenbaum is married to Harvard professor Steven Kelman. They have two adult children. Education Dr. Metzenbaum is a leading expert in the field of public sector performance management. She completed her Ph.D. at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in 1992, where her doctoral thesis focused on lessons for state governments on bidding tactics to use when attempting to attract businesses. It was based on a case study of bidding wars for GM's Saturn plant and the MicroElectronics Computer Corporation. Previous to this, she received a Masters in Public Policy from the Kennedy School and completed her Bachelor of Arts, with an emphasis on humanities and Asian studies, at Stanford University. She has worked in state and federal government, in the private sector, in academia, and for not-for- profit organizations. State Government In the late 1980s, Dr. Metzenbaum served as the director of the Office of Capital Planning and Budgeting for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In that role she was responsible for the Commonwealth's capital budgeting, planning and monitoring of capital projects. She built the capacity to analyze and predict spending patterns for bonding purposes. In the early 1990s, she served as the undersecretary of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs. She oversaw employees in five Commonwealth agencies and reformed the environmental permitting process to cut processing times and increase revenues. She also initiated reforms of the Commonwealth's Superfund program and led a project resulting in the creation of the New England Environmental Business Council. Federal Government, Clinton Administration In 1993, Dr. Metzenbaum was appointed by President Clinton to serve as Associate Administrator for Regional Operations and State/Local Relations for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, D.C. She was responsible for management of EPA's ten regional offices and EPA's relationships with states and localities. She led the design and implementation of the National Environmental Performance Partnership System, which used data to streamline management attention to identifying potential problems and developing interventions. Academia After her service in the Clinton Administration, Dr. Metzenbaum was a Visiting Professor and Senior Research Fellow at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. At the University of Maryland, she was faculty chair of an executive education program on the policy-making process in science-based federal agencies originally developed for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Prior to that, she served as adjunct faculty at the Brookings Institution, running the \\"Science and Technology Policy\\" and \\"Managing for Results\\" programs. In 2008, Dr. Metzenbaum became the founding director of the Edward J. Collins Jr. Center for Public Management at the University of Massachusetts, in Boston. The Center is dedicated to helping governments work better, focusing on improving the people, performance, and productivity of government and intergovernmental arrangements. In that role, she developed a university-based resource center for improving public performance management at the federal, state, and local levels. For example, the Center coordinates MassStat, a consortium of local governments committed to learning from each other's experiences in using data to make performance decisions. Federal Government, Obama Administration In 2009, Dr. Metzenbaum was appointed by President Obama as the Associate Director for Performance and Personnel Management at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In this role, she was responsible for implementation of the Government Performance and Results Act of 2010, which requires strategic planning, goal-setting, annual performance reporting on all federal agency goals, and quarterly performance reporting and data-driven reviews on every agency's priority goals. She also led the government-wide Performance Improvement Council and was responsible for guiding government-wide personnel policy. Dr. Metzenbaum is an elected fellow to the National Academy of Public Administration, and was recognized in 2011 as one of the Federal Computer Week's Federal 100, in recognition for her leadership on performance issues. Volcker Alliance Dr. Metzenbaum left the federal government in May 2013 to serve as the President of the Volcker Alliance, founded by former United States Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker. A nonpartisan organization based in New York City, The Volcker Alliance aims to catalyze new thinking and action with respect to federal, state, and local government in the U.S. and abroad. Through partnerships with education institutions, governmental organizations, business groups, and public interest enterprises, the Alliance sponsors research on government performance, makes actionable recommendations for policy and implementation, and provides a forum for discussion of new ideas and tools to strengthen policy execution at all levels of government. Beyond this, the Alliance works to restore a high degree of public confidence in both the decision-making processes of government and in its administrative management.

It is an eastern continuation of Cheapside, between Old Jewry and Mansion House Street, towards Bank junction. Etymology Poultry takes its name, like other roads nearby such as Milk Street and Bread Street, from the various produce once sold at Cheapside (meaning \\"market-place\\" in Old English). John Stow, writing at the end of the 16th century, noted that \\"the poulterers are but lately departed from thence into other streets\\".Quoted in Wheatley 1891, Volume 3, p.116 History The thoroughfare was anciently known as Conningshop-lane on account of the three conies or rabbits hanging over a poulterer's stall in the lane. In the 15th and early 17th century, Poultry was noted for its taverns, but few were rebuilt after the Great Fire of 1666. On the north side of the street once stood the church of St Mildred Poultry. Rebuilt after the Great Fire to the designs of Sir Christopher Wren, it was demolished in 1872Wheatley 1891, Volume 2, p.540 and its site sold and used to build the Gresham Life Assurance office.Wheatley 1891, Volume 3,p.116 In 1891, Henry B. Wheatley wrote that, with the removal of the church, > \\"the clearing away of the old houses on both sides of the way, and the > erection in their place of large blocks of offices and shops of considerable > architectural pretensions, and the general widening of the thoroughfare, the > Poultry has since 1850 been entirely changed in character and > aspect.\\"Wheatley 1891, Volume 3, p.117 The street gave its name to a prison, Poultry Compter, once located there. It was a brick building with fifteen wards, one of which was set aside specifically for Jews. It was closed in the early 19th century, and its prisoners transferred to the new White Cross Street Compter.Wheatley 1891, Volume 3, pp.117 and 502 Notable buildings Although relatively short in length, Poultry is the location of a number of notable buildings. No 1 Poultry is a postmodern office and retail building which is home to the Coq d'Argent restaurant, which includes a rooftop terrace and formal garden. A small lane off Poultry, Grocers' Hall Court, leads to the livery hall of the Worshipful Company of Grocers, one of the City's original twelve great livery companies that ranks second in the companies' order of precedence. The main entrance to the hall is on Princes Street to the north. At 27-35 Poultry is the old headquarters of Midland Bank, a Grade I listed building.

History and origin There are various theories as to the origin of the Patari tribe. According to the tribe itself, the Patari are by origin Gond tribals, who were ritual specialists and advisers to the Gond kings. They belong to the Devgond sub-division. Other sources, such as William Crooke claim that the Patari are actually of Majhwar origin, and descend from seven brothers, of which their ancestor Patari was responsible for the rituals and traditions of the other six Majhwar clans. The Patari once spoke Chhattisgarhi, but now speak Hindi. They are found throughout south eastern Uttar Pradesh, but are concentrated in Sonbhadra district.People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three edited by A Hasan & J C Das pages 1135 to 1138 Social organisation The Patari are further divided into four sub- divisions, each of which have separate totemistic septs called kuris. Major septs among the first sub-group include the Narkam, Poija, Kusro, Soi, Neti, and Serlo. In the second sub-group, major kuris include the Tekam, Netam. Pusan and Marpachi.While in the third sub-groups, major kuri include the Marai and Sarota, and fourth sub-group, the kuris include the Kuram, Poika, and Armon. The Patari are endogamous, but practice kuri exogamy. The Patari are priests, locally known as Baigas, of a number of tribal grouping in south-east Uttar Pradesh such as the Majhwar, Chero and Bhuiyar. Their community deities include Buradeo, and they incorporate a number of folk beliefs. The Patari have a traditional caste council, referred to as the biradari panchayat, to which are inter-community disputes are referred too. This is headed by a Chaudhary, a position which hereditary. Most Chaudhary families are perceived as natural leaders of the community. The panchayat has the power to excommunicate a person, but more often fines are given. A large number of issues such as elopement or adultery are dealt with by the panchayat. Many Patari are now farmers and sharecroppers, having abandoned their traditional occupation of the priesthood. An important subsidiary occupation is animal husbandry. The Government of Uttar Pradesh had classified the Patari as a Scheduled Caste but by 2007, they were one of several groups that it redesignated as Scheduled Tribes. As of 2017, this tribal designation applies only for Sonbhadra district, as it also did at the time of the 2011 Census of India when the Patari Scheduled Caste population in Uttar Pradesh was 366.

The term \\"contextual behavioral science\\" refers to the application of functional contextualism to human behavior, including contextual forms of applied behavior analysis, cognitive behavioral therapy, and evolution science. In the applied area Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is perhaps the best known wing of contextual behavioral science, and is an emphasis of ACBS, along with other types of contextual CBT, and efforts in education, organizational behavior, and other areas. ACT is considered an empirically validated treatment by the American Psychological Association, with the status of \\"Modest Research Support\\" in depression and \\"Strong Research Support\\" in chronic pain, with several others specific areas such as psychosis and work site stress currently under review. ACT is also listed as evidence-based by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of the United States federal government which has examined randomized trials for ACT in the areas of psychosis, work site stress, and obsessive compulsive disorder, including depression outcomes. In the basic area, Relational Frame Theory is a research program in language and cognition that is considered part of contextual behavioral science, and is a focus of ACBS.Blackledge, J.T. (2003). An Introduction to Relational Frame Theory: Basics and Applications . The Behavior Analyst Today, 3, 421–34. Unlike the better known behavioral approach proposed by B.F. Skinner in his book Verbal Behavior, experimental RFT research has emerged in a number of areas traditionally thought to be beyond behavioral perspectives, such as grammar, metaphor, perspective taking, implicit cognition and reasoning.Barnes-Holmes, Y.; Barnes-Holmes, D. & McHugh, L.

As opposed to equally spaced time series, the spacing of observation times is not constant. Unevenly spaced time series naturally occur in many industrial and scientific domains: natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, or volcanic eruptions typically occur at irregular time intervals. In observational astronomy, measurements such as spectra of celestial objects are taken at times determined by weather conditions, availability of observation time slots, and suitable planetary configurations. In clinical trials (or more generally, longitudinal studies), a patient's state of health may be observed only at irregular time intervals, and different patients are usually observed at different points in time. Wireless sensors in the Internet of things often transmit information only when a state changes to conserve battery life. There are many more examples in climatology, ecology, high-frequency finance, geology, and signal processing. Analysis A common approach to analyzing unevenly spaced time series is to transform the data into equally spaced observations using some form of interpolation - most often linear - and then to apply existing methods for equally spaced data. However, transforming data in such a way can introduce a number of significant and hard to quantify biases, especially if the spacing of observations is highly irregular. Ideally, unevenly spaced time series are analyzed in their unaltered form. However, most of the basic theory for time series analysis was developed at a time when limitations in computing resources favored an analysis of equally spaced data, since in this case efficient linear algebra routines can be used and many problems have an explicit solution. As a result, fewer methods currently exist specifically for analyzing unevenly spaced time series data.

Background In the 1980s, SEPTA was in the process of upgrading its Subway–Surface Trolley Lines, replacing its fleet of PCCs with new light rail cars. Some lines, such as Routes 60, 50, 53, and 6 were converted to buses, while Routes 23, 56, and 15 continued to use PCCs into the 1990s. In 1992, SEPTA ended streetcar service on these three lines as well. In response to public outcry over the conversion, SEPTA stated that the suspension of these lines' streetcar service was temporary, and that they would be restored in 1997. However, during this time little was done to restore the lines, and as 1997 approached, it became clear that SEPTA had no immediate plans to restore streetcar service to these lines. In September 1997, at a City Council hearing, Jack Leary, SEPTA's general manager at the time, announced plans to restore streetcar service to only one of the three lines, Route 15. The initial proposal was to purchase twelve low-floor articulated light rail cars, to make some existing railcars available for the line. However, this was found to be prohibitively costly, and the decision was made instead to rehabilitate older cars for the service. To this end, SEPTA sent eighteen of its retired PCC cars to the Brookville Equipment Company to be rebuilt, with another six to be used for parts. SEPTA PCC II cars, shortly after entering service on Route 15. The first of the rebuilt cars debuted on September 9, 2003, and Route 15 was planned to open little under a year later. However, the line remained closed for another year due to disputes with local residents on 59th Street over parking on the street. During this time, the cars remained stored in the Callowhill depot, although they were occasionally used for special charters on the Subway–Surface routes. The cars entered full service on September 4, 2005. By 2020, 14 of the 18 cars were unable to pass their internal mechanical inspections, thus prompting an early suspension of service on the Girard Avenue line to allow for refurbishments. (Plans had called for a shorter disruption to accommodate track refurbishment and a highway expansion, but this was initiated early when the breadth of mechanical issues were discovered.) Design PCC II car at Richmond and Westmoreland loop. Essentially, the PCC II is a completely new car built within an old PCC car's shell. All new motors and brakes based on the PCC B3 truck design have been installed, as well as new air-conditioning units. The cars feature control consoles resembling those of SEPTA's modern Kawasaki light rail cars, as well as revised interiors with reused seats from retired SEPTA Volvo-built buses. The rear doorway has been widened and features a wheelchair lift, thus making the PCC IIs the first streetcars operated by SEPTA to be ADA- accessible. The cars are painted in a unique green, red, and cream livery, nearly identical to that of the PCC cars of SEPTA's predecessor, the Philadelphia Transportation Company, as well as featuring a modified \\"wing\\" logo, which features the SEPTA \\"S\\" symbol in place of the \\"P-T-C\\" lettering.

Alexey Cardo, the producer of the Moscow Racer, was quoted in the very first press-release of the game, describing the ambitions of the studio as \\"We completely understand that we won't make an absolutely top-level game from the very first step...what we are going to do is to create a series of good and dynamic racing games. And after several releases, we plan to make products of world-best quality\\". In April 2008 another video of improved version of the game was published. Pre-release versions of the Moscow Racer had been demonstrated at a number of public events, including the 2008 E3 Expo. A number of sites and magazines have posted their previews of the game, mostly interested in the opportunity to race in highly-realistic streets of Moscow: GamersInfo.net: \\"Da, comrade speed racer, here we go!\\" \\"There are two things that really show up for a street racing game: credibility, in terms of having the verisimilitude of the racing, as well as the setting, have a unique and interesting setting that sets you firmly into position as to where and why you're racing. Moscow Racer does this on both counts... hopefully we'll get a chance to really sit down and see how it feels to put the pedal to the metal in a Ford Mustang on Moscow city streets\\". GameSpot.com: \\"Moscow Racer is still very early on, but its intriguing locale should offer an interesting change of pace for PC game players, who don't have a lot of racing games to choose from these days, anyway.\\" In Russia the Moscow Racer had received a number of awards during development phase («The Best Debut of the Year» Russian Games developers Conference and other).

The fifth typhoon and first super typhoon of the 1979 Pacific typhoon season, it formed as a tropical depression southeast of Guam on July 24.\\"1979 ATCR Table of contents\\" US Navy. Retrieved 12-01-08. It headed to the west- northwest, but upper-level shear from the TUTT caused the depression to dissipate on the 27th. It turned northward then westward, where it regenerated on the 28th. Intensification became more steady, with the depression reaching storm strength on the 28th and typhoon strength on the 29th. On the 31st, Hope reached a peak of 150 mph winds, but land interaction with Taiwan to the north weakened the storm. On August 2, Typhoon Hope struck southern China, only 10 miles east of Hong Kong. It weakened over the country while moving westward, but retained its satellite signature. Upon reaching the Bay of Bengal on the 7th, Hope restrengthened to a tropical storm, but moved over India and dissipated on the 8th. In Guangdong Province in China, the typhoon was responsible for around 100 deaths or missing people. Twelve people died along with 260 injured in Hong Kong. Typhoon Hope was the most intense typhoon to hit Hong Kong since Typhoon Rose of the 1971 season.

It started moving westwards for a day and then moved northwest without much development for the next two days. The maximum sustained winds were only about 25 mph (40 km/h) during that period. On the morning of July 28, it intensified to a tropical depression. While the system slowly moved west, the storm intensified to a tropical storm in the early hours of July 29, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assigned the system the name Hope. At 6:20 in the evening on July 29, a reconnaissance aircraft reported that the minimum central pressure had dropped to 972 millibars (hPa; 28.7 inHg) and maximum sustained winds reached . The system continued to rapidly intensify and became a typhoon on the JMA scale. Hope gradually accelerated and by early morning of July 31. On that day the minimum central pressure dropped to 925 millibars. The eye became well-organized and continued to go under explosive deepening. By the evening of July 31, the maximum sustained winds had risen to 150 mph (240 km/h), equivalent to a Category 4 super typhoon. On August 1, Typhoon Hope reached maximum intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a minimum central pressure reading of 900 millibars by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). At 1:00 pm that day, the system passed within 15 nautical miles of Batan. An hour later, the minimum pressure rose to about 950 millibars. Hope was closest to the Republic of China in the afternoon. Gales and heavy rain associated with the typhoon caused much damage there. In the eastern part of the island, numerous houses were destroyed and many houses were completely wiped out. Farmlands and ponds suffered much devastation. In the city of Hengchun, hundreds of houses were flooded with water and one person drowned. Tremendous devastation was caused to vegetation, crops and other goods. Then, Hope passed through the Bashi Channel. While passing there, Hope took a west- northwest course and accelerated to enter the South China Sea. At 6:06 PM on August 1, the minimum pressure dropped to about 920 millibars. Hope reached the eastern parts of Hong Kong at around 2:00 PM on August 2 and made landfall about a few miles east of Hong Kong. While it moved across the area, it slowed down to an average speed of only 20 mph (30 km/h). Hope then continued to move westward across the Pearl River estuary and swept through Guangdong. Macau survived the storm with only minor damages and minor disruption to public services. No deaths were reported. Hope gradually weakened to a tropical storm in the midnight of August 3 while turning to move west-southwest. On August 3 that same day, Hope passed over the northern coast of the Gulf of Tonkin and dissipated about 110 nautical miles (200 kilometers) west of Hanoi. Impact Typhoon Hope making landfall in southern China. Typhoon Hope spared Taiwan, killing at least four men and disrupted many highways and railroads along the island's southeastern coast. Waves of up to 20 feet (6.1 meters) washed out 150 miles (240 kilometers) of railroad track in one incident. The typhoon caused gale-force winds and heavy rains which caused great property damage there. In the eastern part of Taiwan, 38 houses were collapsed and 132 housed were seriously damaged or completely destroyed. Farmland and fish ponds were devastated. A number of bridges were broken. In Hengchun, southern Taiwan, 500 houses were flooded and one person died. Widespread flooding was also reported in other places over southern Taiwan. Tremendous damage was caused to crops and vegetation. Two people also drowned in fishing towns in the Philippines as Hope brushed the northern part of the archipelago. On August 2, Typhoon Hope slammed into Hong Kong bringing 145 mph (230 km/h) winds, tossing freighters about in the harbour and hurling debris through the streets of one of the world's most populated places. The storm flooded low-lying areas and killed at least one person and injured at least 18 other people. Other debris rocketed through the streets and ricocheted off buildings. Parked cars were crushed by snapped trees. A three-year-old girl died when she was swept off the deck of her family's fishing junk by a wind-whipped wave and drowned. Hope sucked windows away from buildings and flooded the interior of many homes. Flimsy shacks that served as homes from immigrants from China were completely blown away. Several freighters in the Victoria Harbour flew in the air as a result of the high winds. The high winds and giant waves also sent some ships, dragging their anchors and out of control, crashing into one another. The typhoon also triggered mudslides. The typhoon injured at least 260 people. Trees were uprooted, huge glass advertising signs were smashed into little tiny pieces, streets flooded and sheet metal from construction sites hurled through the air. Public transportation, such as domestic flights, were halted. The typhoon also destroyed 200 cylinders of dangerous cyanide.\\"Typhoon Hope destroys cyanide cylinders\\" The Palm Beach Post.

Between 1793 and 1795 Boddington made one trip for the East India Company from Penang to Britain.British Library: Boddington. She apparently was in Bengal prior to arriving at Penang. Lloyd's List reported that \\"The Boddingtons, Chalmers, from Bengal to London, met with bad weather which obliged her to put into Prince of Wales Island, where she has been refitted, and was to proceed under Convoy of the Bombay frigate.\\"Lloyd's List, №2717.At the time, the frigate Bombay belonged to the East India Company; the Royal Navy purchased her in 1805.

Character origins and appearance Physically, the character of Wilfredo is a grotesque caricature of Falstaffian appearance: trousers pulled up to the top of a corpulent stomach, a tight flamenco shirt, a wild black mop wig and a set of prominent prosthetic teeth. Typically, the character will always hold a pint of beer on stage, even whilst dancing and singing. He smokes his way throughout songs, salivating over the audience and musicians while berating them with rich expletives. Critics have described the character as \\"a wonderful and vile creation\\",Broadway Baby Editor Review - Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Broadway Baby, retrieved 8 January 2012 \\"strangely endearing\\",Wilfredo: Erecto!

Review - Three Weeks, Three Weeks, retrieved 8 January 2012 The character began his life onstage performing cover versions of songs by Leonard Cohen, Phil Spector, Amy Winehouse and the Rolling Stones. In an interview with the student media, Roper stated: \\"My father was a trad comic so I grew up around a lot of the old school; people like Frankie Howerd and lots of music hall acts. I’d be taken to theatres and all these smoky clubs where there was always a mad speciality artist or a singer in a spangly outfit or a dinner suit onstage, crooning covers. Wilfredo comes from that world for sure.\\" Elsewhere in the same interview, Roper said he hoped Wilfredo \\"offers escape\\". Roper has constructed an entire life history and family background to Wilfredo and updates audiences through his performance. The character hails from Granada in Spain, the fourth son of a fourth son, a gifted child prodigy who evolved into a national singing star. The character is always accompanied by a guitarist onstage, often by Katie Pollak in the role of Mana Maria, the younger sister of Wilfredo. The character of Maria wears identical teeth and hair, although pop socked and bespectacled. She is the polar opposite of Wilfredo: where Wilfredo is brash and loud, Maria in contrast is totally mute and performed in a subtle style. On occasion (as at the 2011 Edinburgh Festival) Kris Howe may accompany – also in character – as Wilfredo's 'Uncle' Ignacio. Wilfredo's life story is juxtaposed with real life historical events into which Wilfredo is fictionally placed: an appearance at the Benidorm International Song Contest Festival for example is claimed,Exclusive Interview - Christmas Wilfredo and Other Beautiful Creatures, London, The New Current, retrieved 8 January 2012 as is a friendship and a near collaboration with Serge Gainsbourg.

Born at Stoke Newington, North London, on 7 September 1898,Norman Wright and David Ashford, Masters of Fun and Thrills: The British Comic Artists Vol 1, Norman Wright (pub.), 2008, pp. 131-144 he was awarded a special scholarship to the Central School of Arts and Crafts at the age of 15. A photo of him appeared in the Boy's Own Paper celebrating his achievement.W. O. G. Lofts, The Eric Parker Story, Collectors Digest Vol. 37 issues 437-440, 1983, formerly presented on the Blakiana website, via Internet Archive During the First World War he served with the Royal Buckinghamshire Hussars and in military intelligence MI 7b alongside Captain Bruce Bairnsfather, producing propaganda directed at the Home Front - See \\"MI 7b - the discovery of a lost propaganda archive from the Great War\\". After the war he became a freelance illustrator, contributing to periodicals including The Strand Magazine. He joined the Amalgamated Press as a staff artist in 1922, where Harold Twyman, editor of the story paper Union Jack, was looking to give detective character Sexton Blake a new direction and a more identifiable look. Parker drew him as a tall, lean pipe-smoker with receding hair, an interpretation that became definitive. Throughout the 1930s he illustrated Blake's adventures in Union Jack (until it closed in 1933), Detective Weekly (from 1933 on) and the Sexton Blake Library, for which he painted all the covers until 1953,Alan Clark, Dictionary of British Comic Artists, Writers and Editors, The British Library, 1998, p. 125 and continued illustrating the character until 1955 when a new editor decided on another revamp. At the same time, he was providing illustrations for Chums, The Strand Magazine, Pearsons, The Scout, Wide World, Wild West Weekly and others. In 1939 AP launched a new comic, Knockout, for which Parker initially supplied spot illustrations for prose stories, later also drawing comic strips, mostly historical adventures, including westerns starring Buffalo Bill and Kit Carson, and adaptations of classic novels like Kidnapped and The Children of the New Forest and the 1947 Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. film The Exile. Although Knockout featured Sexton Blake in comic strip adventures, it was only in 1949 that Parker drew a Sexton Blake comic strip serial, \\"The Secret of Monte Cristo\\". The same year he illustrated the prose adventures of Beau Brummell, who writer Frank S. Pepper imagined living a double life as a highwayman. After 1949 he also worked for two new AP comics, Sun and Comet, drawing \\"The Happy Hussar\\", set during the Napoleonic Wars, for the former, and \\"Nelson\\", a biographical strip of the Naval hero, and the adventures of highwayman Claude Duval, for the latter. During the 1950s he drew more westerns and historical adventures for Cowboy Comics Library and Thriller Comics, and in the early 1960s he drew \\"The Three Rollicking Rogues\\" for Buster. In the late 1940s and 50s he also drew five newspaper strips: \\"Pepys' Diary\\" for The Evening News, \\"Making a Film\\" and \\"Paula\\" for the Daily Express, Elizabethan strip \\"An Age of Greatness\\" for the Daily Globe, and \\"Our Gang\\" for The Sunday Pictorial. He also drew \\"Tommy Walls\\", a series of adverts in comic strip form for Wall's ice cream in the Eagle, full colour political advertisements for the Conservative Party, and illustrations and covers for The Soldier, official magazine of the British Army. In 1960 Parker was appointed art director for educational magazine Look and Learn, which involved laying out comic strips for other artists to draw. He also contributed to Ranger, including a full colour feature called \\"Scrapbook of the British Soldier\\", which he wrote as well as illustrated based on his knowledge of military history, beginning in 1966. The \\"Scrapbook\\" moved to Look and Learn when Ranger merged into it, and was followed by \\"Scrapbook of the British Sailor\\", and \\"For Valour\\", on the history of medals. When he died on 21 March 1974 he was working on a new series, \\"A Thousand Years of Spying\\".

Because of the rigorous Spartan laws, Talos must be sacrificed to the wolves of Mount Taygetus as his physical weakness would not permit him to help the military city of Sparta during its many wars. However, the young Talos miraculously survives. Nobody would have imagined that the two brothers would ever meet again and even less so that they would meet on a battlefield.

Because of the cruel and strict laws in vigour at Sparta, babies that were deformed, crippled or had any health issues would not serve the city-state its purpose, which was to battle; therefore, these weaker children had to be sacrificed at Mount Taygetus. The young Talos however survives, rescued by a shepherd of the Helots, the people who served as slaves to the Spartans. This shepherd, who becomes Talos' adoptive father, raises Talos with love and recounts him the intriguing tale of Aristodemus, the last King of the Helots. The legend goes that he who wears his armour, shall be the one to free the Helots from slavery. However, the blood that runs in his veins is Spartan after all; Talos the Cripple is drawn back to his hometown and in the midst of the legendary Battle of Thermopylae. Here he faces the inhuman brutality and savagery of the Spartan soldiers and meets his brother for the first time since their separation. When he crosses his brother's gaze whilst attempting to protect Antinea, the woman he loves. But destiny has got a better fate for them in store: as a war between the Achaemenid Empire and the Greek city-states looms, the two brothers will find each other again and will fight shoulder to shoulder for the future of their country. Along the way, he discovers some thing of his Spartan life like his real name is Kleidemos. When his brother dies, he oversees the Helots, with the help of his friend Karas, helps the Helots have victory over his own race.

In a career that lasted from 1855 to 1856 he ran eleven times and won four races. A leading two-year-old in 1855, when his wins included the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster, he won only one of his seven races the following year. That win, however, came in The Derby, where his ability to handle soft ground proved to be decisive. Ellington was retired to stud at the end of his three-year-old season, but had very little impact as a sire. Background Ellington was a long, low brown horse standing 15.2½ hands high with a \\"coarse\\" head and unusually large feet. He was owned by Octavius Vernon Harcourt, an admiral in the Royal Navy. Ellington was trained at Middleham, North Yorkshire, by Thomas Dawson, the older brother of the more famous Mathew Dawson. Ellington's sire, The Flying Dutchman was one of the outstanding horses of the mid-nineteenth century, winning fourteen of his fifteen races including the Derby and the St Leger. He became a moderately successful stallion in England but had much greater success after being exported to France. Ellington's dam Ellerdale was a notable broodmare, who also produced The Oaks winner Summerside and the Champagne Stakes winner Gildermire. Racing career 1855: two-year-old season As a two-year-old in 1855 Ellington began his career in August at York where he finished in fourth in the Eglington Stakes and then won the Sapling Stakes at the same meeting. In the latter race he went well clear and was winning so easily that his jockey, Thomas Aldcroft stopped riding and was almost caught on the line by Job Marson on Gildert. His most significant result came on 11 September when he contested the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster for which he started at odds of 10/1. He took the lead in the straight and won \\"cleverly\\" by three quarters of a length from Bird-in-Hand. He was regarded as a contender for the following year's British Classic Races, and Admiral Harcourt turned down an offer of £4,000 for the colt. He spent the winter on Harcourt's estate, where he was reportedly used as a hack by the Admiral's coachman. 1856: three-year-old season Ellington, from the Illustrated London News Ellington made his first appearance of the year in a race at York in April. He was not fully fit and ran well to finish second by a head to Fisherman, a top class colt to whom he was conceding six pounds. In May he was sent to Chester where he started 4/6 favourite for the Dee Stakes but finished second of the nine runners behind Bird-in-Hand. His performance at Chester was disappointing as he seemed to \\"cut it\\" (give up) under pressure and it was only with difficulty that Dawson persuaded Admiral Harcourt to send him to Epsom for the Derby. At Epsom on 4 June he started a 20/1 outsider in a field of twenty-four runners. Aldcroft rode a waiting race on Ellington, tracking the leaders and moving steadily closer in the straight before making his challenge inside the final furlong. He moved past the leader Yellow Jack in the closing stages and won comfortably by a length with the favourite Fazzoletto third. Ellington was one of the few horses to cope with the extremely soft ground: the winning time of 3:04.0 remains the slowest ever recorded. Ellington was made 8/13 favourite for the St Leger at Doncaster, but finished well-beaten behind Warlock. Dawson offered no excuses for his colt's defeat although some felt that Aldcroft had ridden a poor race on the favourite, forcibly restraining him in the early stages instead of allowing him to gallop. At the same meeting two days later he started odds-on again for the one mile Don Stakes but was beaten a length and a half by the only other runner, Artillery. Later the same afternoon he turned out again for the Doncaster Stakes over one and a half miles, in which he carried top weight of 129 pounds and finished fourth of the six runners behind Bonnie Scotland. Later that autumn he was sent to Scotland and finished unplaced in the Roxburghe Handicap at Kelso on 21 October. He was then retired to stud. Assessment Ellington was considered a good horse who had beaten a strong Derby field, but also a rather temperamental and unreliable performer. Stud career Ellington stood as a stallion at Willesden Paddocks, Kilburn at a fee of 15 guineas, but failed to sire any horses of consequence. He had more success in an alternative career as a show-horse, winning a £100 first prize at the 1862 Royal Show. His last recorded foals were conceived in 1869.

It serves the community of Kingston, Ontario, Canada, and is located in the John Deutsch University Centre of Queen’s University. It is operated by volunteers year round who respond to inquiries by phone or in person. It is funded by student fees from the Alma Mater Society and Society of Graduate and Professional Students at Queen’s University. History Dr. Jim Whitley, a math professor and assistant to the Principal, helped spearhead a student project in 1971 called the Birth Control and Abortion Information and Referral Centre, which was also staffed by full-time coordinators. One of the initial goals of the Centre was to provide information on “birth control, abortion, infertility, vasectomies and veneral disease, and medical referrals.” By 1974, its expanding mandate led to a name change to the Birth Control, VD & Abortion Referral Centre. The Centre moved to the Grey House at 51 Bader Lane in 1975 and established a lending library. The name was again changed to the shorter “Birth Control Centre” in 1983. The Centre began selling sexual health products at cost with the introduction of spermicidal foam and condom wallets in the late 1980s. This selection expanded by 1991 to include spermicidal jelly and sponges. In 1995, the Centre was again renamed as the “(Not Just the) Birth Control Centre” in recognition of its growing mandate, which was again promptly changed to the Sexual Health Resource Centre, which it remains today. In 2004, theSHRC began receiving direct funding from Queen’s University undergraduate students through the establishment of a mandatory $0.85 CAD fee per student. The fee withstood a challenge that it discriminated against students on the basis of religion that same year. Services The SHRC is an educational resource to the community it serves. It has its own lending library, separate from the Queen’s University library, and has a diverse selection of pamphlets. SHRC volunteers have also offered educational teach-in sessions for audiences ranging from elementary school to university students and other community groups since 1984. Teach-ins cover a range of topics from healthy relationships, contraception, sexually transmitted infections, and sex toys. The SHRC also sells an assortment of sexual health and pleasure products at cost. The Centre began selling products in 1987, beginning with spermicidal foam. Contraceptive and protective methods currently sold include a variety of condoms, dental dams, and reality condoms (aka female condoms). The SHRC has also sold sex toys at cost since 2001, such as dildos, masturbatory sleeves, vibrators, and bondage play items.

He was designated Navy Air Pilot No. 3 and later Naval Aviator No. 11. Two U.S. Navy destroyers have borne the name Mustin in honor of Captain Mustin and his descendants, three of whom have served as flag officers. Early life and career 126x126px Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Mustin graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1896. He spent two years at sea, as required by law, before he was commissioned an ensign. From then until he reported to duty in aviation 15 years later, he distinguished himself as a remarkably capable officer in the surface navy. After receiving his commission, Mustin served during the next 18 months on board six different ships. From October 1899 to March 1900, he served as commanding officer of , a gunboat on the Asiatic Station. While commanding Samar, during the capture of Vigan in the Philippine Islands, Mustin won a commendation for towing the boats of the battleship to shore and aiding in covering the landing. After a night of carousing in May 1900, Mustin was court-martialed for leaving his station and sleeping on watch, resulting in the loss of five numbers in grade. The court martial reconvened to pardon him, and he eventually had his numbers restored by President Theodore Roosevelt, who heard that Mustin had punched a British sailor for insulting the U.S. Navy during the night in question. Mustin was also interested in the technical aspects of naval artillery and helped develop a telescopic sight that would aid in increasing the accuracy and range of naval gunnery. He made his first flight while on duty at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. In January 1911, he aided Holden C. Richardson in an experiment with a glider, which Richardson designed and built. Mustin soloed on 13 March 1913. Naval Aeronautic Station Naval Aeronautic Station at Pensacola, Florida. Henry Mustin is fourth from right.|181x181px In 1913, plans for a national naval air service were taking shape, and Pensacola, Florida, was chosen over Annapolis, Maryland, as the site of a training facility, as the warmer weather along the United States Gulf Coast would be better for year-round flying. On 31 December 1913, Mustin reported for duty as executive officer of , a battleship being sent to Pensacola Bay for training purposes. On 6 January 1914, under a new ranking system for officers, Mustin was designated Navy Air Pilot No. 3 (after Theodore G. Ellyson and John H. Towers). A detachment of nine officers and about two dozen enlisted men arrived at Pensacola on 20 January and began to establish the new school. It was operational by February. Mustin and his wife and two sons, Lloyd and Henry, moved into Quarters A on the station. U.S. Navy aircraft over 101x101px Following the Tampico Affair on 9 April 1914, the United States sent a squadron of warships to Veracruz, Mexico. After first sending three planes to Veracruz aboard the light cruiser , Lieutenant Commander Mustin took temporary command of Mississippi as her acting captain and led a second aviation detachment, along with 500 United States Marines, aboard her to the campaign. They arrived at Veracruz on the evening of 24 April 1914. The United States occupation of Veracruz marked both the first operational use of naval aircraft and the first time that any U.S. aviator of any service was the target of ground fire. Mississippi began her voyage back to Pensacola on 12 June 1914 to make repairs to the aircraft which had seen continued use without means of maintenance. In July 1914, Mustin took Mississippi to Norfolk, Virginia, to be sold to Greece. Washington Post Article 124x124px Mustin was named commandant of the Naval Aeronautic Station in April 1915. With USD $1 million in funding for the year, the station conducted antisubmarine patrols, worked on the development of a new bombsight and a gyroscopic sextant, and saw the arrival of ten new students in July 1915. A new station ship, the armored cruiser , arrived in Pensacola on 9 September 1915. On 5 November 1915, Mustin launched himself from North Carolina via catapult in a Curtiss Model AB-2, recording both the worlds first catapulting of an aircraft from a ship and the first takeoff from a ship underway. Actually, the first takeoff from a ship underway was by the Royal Navy's Commander Charles Rumney Samson from in May 1912, three and a half years earlier. The RN used a ramp for launch, while the US developed a catapult launch system. Mustin was outspoken about the potential of naval aviation, despite conclusions by officials that \\"aeronautics does not offer a prospect of becoming the principal means of exercising compelling force against the enemy.\\" He lobbied to halt funding of dirigible projects and focus development on high-speed fighter aircraft. He and fellow naval aviator Kenneth Whiting worked together on seaplane designs and filed a patent application for the design of a \\"hydroaeroplane\\" on 27 October 1916.Universal Ship Cancellation Society Log, July 2011, p. 21. However, the hurricane that struck Pensacola on 18 October 1916 caused more than $1 million in damage to the base, and Mustin faced accusations that his \\"wrong flying instruction methods\\" had caused the deaths of two naval aviators, Lieutenants, junior grade, Richard C. Saufley and James V. Rockwell – developments that greatly dampened plans for the Aeronautic Station. He was detached from Pensacola on 31 January 1917 and, as then customary, his Naval Aviator designation was revoked simultaneously. While he returned to sea duty, Mustin ultimately was promoted and restored to aviation command. Later career On 15 January 1918, Mustin, then executive officer of the battleship , saved the life of a sailor who was washed overboard, earning him the Gold Life Saving Medal. However, the effort took a heavy toll on his health, from which he never entirely recovered. Mustin began development of a \\"sea sled\\" carrier vessel that year, conducting tests from November 1918 to March 1919. The armistice with Germany and end of World War I on 11 November 1918 ended Mustins sea sled development, although it would be revived during World War II and praised for its ingenuity. 220x220px CAPT Mustin's Return from Panama In December 1919, Commander Mustin assumed command of the minelayer with additional duty as commander, Air Detachment, United States Pacific Fleet. While in command of the Air Detachment, later designated Aircraft Squadrons, Pacific Fleet, Mustin led a flight of a dozen airplanes on a record breaking 3,019 mile flight from San Diego, California, to Balboa, Panama. Mustin was ordered to report to the United States Department of the Navy for duty as its first Assistant Chief, Bureau of Aeronautics in late October 1921, reporting for duty there on 6 November 1921. He was promoted to Captain on 1 January 1922. Death Captain Mustin was admitted to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, in January 1923 suffering from chest pain. After a protracted illness lasting several months, he died at Newport, Rhode Island, on 23 August 1923. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. After Captain Mustin's untimely death his widow, Corinne, married naval aviator George D. Murray who had lost his wife in 1920. Family Captain Mustin married Corinne DeForest Montague, great-granddaughter of Commodore Arthur Sinclair, and a first cousin and close confidante of Wallis Simpson who became involved in a controversial relationship with King Edward VIII of Great Britain who abdicated to marry her in 1936. The Mustins had three children Lloyd M., Henry A., and Gordon. His son, Vice Admiral Lloyd M. Mustin, was a 1932 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy who took part in developing the Navy's first lead-computing antiaircraft gun sight. This proved of major importance in the air-sea actions of World War II. VADM Mustin served on the cruiser during the battle of Guadalcanal. His ship was lost, but he and other survivors landed on Guadalcanal and served ashore with a naval unit attached to the First Marine Division. His postwar service included commands at sea and development and evaluation of weapon systems. VADM Mustin later served as director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Another of Captain Mustin's sons, Henry A. Mustin, served in the U.S. Navy as a lieutenant commander during World War II. Captain Mustin's grandsons, retired Navy Vice Admiral Henry Croskey Mustin II, and Lieutenant Commander Thomas M. Mustin, continued their family's legacy of service in the U.S. Navy. Vice Admiral Mustin, a 1955 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, was a destroyerman who served at sea in both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets, and ashore with the Delta River Patrol Group during the Vietnam War. In the 1980s he served as the Naval Inspector General, Commander Second Fleet, and Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Plans and Policy. Lieutenant Commander Mustin, a 1962 Naval Academy graduate, earned a Bronze Star during the Vietnam War for river patrol combat action. Two of Captain Mustin's great-grandsons, Captain Lloyd M. Mustin II, and Rear Admiral John Mustin, a 1990 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy served in the U.S. Navy. Lloyd retired in 2015 and John continues to serve in the Naval Reserves. He briefly returned to active duty service as the commanding officer of Inshore Boat Unit 22, deployed to Kuwait, from 2004 to 2005 and was selected for promotion to rear admiral (lower half) in March 2016. Another great-grandson, Tom Mustin, worked as an actor and is known for his roles in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986), Death Dreams (1991) and Mad at the Moon (1992). He later became a TV news reporter and is currently a news anchor on CBS4 in Denver, Colorado. Captain Mustin's great-great-grandson, Link Mustin, a 2006 graduate of Hampden-Sydney College, is currently an officer in the US Navy.https://www.linkedin.com/in/lmustin?authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken;=Zl4e&locale;=en_US&srchid;=296444121462092113251&srchindex;=1&srchtotal;=1&trk;=vsrp_people_res_name&trkInfo;=VSRPsearchId%3A296444121462092113251%2CVSRPtargetId%3A11084668%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary%2CVSRPnm%3Atrue%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH Commemoration The U.S. Navy destroyer was named for Captain Mustin.

This therapy has two components: pressure to prevent lymphatic drainage, and immobilisation of the bitten limb to prevent the pumping action of the skeletal muscles. Evidence As of 2008, clinical evidence for pressure immobilisation for snakebite was not well established, with clinicians recommending its continued practice for certain snakes (including all snakes in Australia), but calling for further research. Technique Pressure is preferably applied with an elastic bandage. Alternatively it is possible to wrap much of the limb with an intact long-sleeved shirt, but it is difficult to apply an ideal even pressure with an inelastic fabric, and one shirt may not be long enough. Bandaging begins two to four inches above the bite (i.e. between the bite and the heart), winding around in overlapping turns and moving first up towards the heart, then back down over the bite and past it towards the hand or foot. Then the limb must be held immobile: not used, and if possible held with a splint or sling. The bandage should be about as tight as when strapping a sprained ankle. It must not cut off blood flow, or even be uncomfortable; if it is uncomfortable, the person will unconsciously flex the limb, defeating the immobilisation portion of the therapy. The location of the bite should be clearly marked on the outside of the bandages. Some peripheral edema is an expected consequence of this process. History The technique was developed in the 1970s by Australian medical researcher Struan Sutherland. Today, it is the recommended first-aid procedure in Australia for treating most spider bites (especially funnel-web, but not redback) and all snake bites.

In 1792 she transported convicts from Ireland to Australia. On her return trip she sailed from Bengal to Britain under contract to the British East India Company. During the French Revolutionary Wars she sailed under a letter of marque as a slave ship. She made two voyages taking slaves from West Africa to the Americas. In 1796 or 1797, on her second slave trading voyage she captured a French ship, but shortly thereafter was herself captured. The British Royal Navy recaptured her and she apparently was returned to service. She is last listed in 1798. Career She was launched in 1786 upon the Thames River. In 1789 Lloyd's Register showed her master as W. Seaton, her owners as Turner and Co., and her trade as London-St Vincent.Lloyd's Register (1789). She was coppered in 1793. Under the command of Thomas Musgrave, she sailed from Portsmouth for Ireland, on 9 March 1793. Having embarked with 110 male and 50 female convicts, she left Cork, Ireland, on 12 April 1792. A sergeant's party from the New South Wales Corps provided the guards for the convicts. On 25 May the Government's agent had a prisoner executed. The man had managed to get out of his irons and another prisoner had accused the man of planning a mutiny. Sugar Cane arrived at Rio de Janeiro in late June and left on 13 July. Sugar Cane arrived at Port Jackson, New South Wales on 17 September 1793. Other than the man who had been executed, no convicts died on the voyage, and the prisoners arrived in good health.Bateson (1959), pp.129-39. Sugar Cane left Port Jackson for Bengal in late 1793, in company with Boddington. The vessels separated at some point, and Sugar Cane went on to discover some islands in the Caroline archipelago. The islands were the Pingelap () atoll, now part of Pohnpei State of the Federated States of Micronesia. Sugar Cane left Calcutta on 15 May 1794. She reached Madras on 29 June, the Cape on 4 October, St Helena on 25 October, Crookhaven on 25 December, and Kinsale on 31 January. She arrived at the Downs on 27 February.British Library: Sugar Cane. On 18 July 1795, John Marman received a letter of marque for Sugar Cane. The letter of marque authorized Sugar Cane to engage in offensive action against French shipping should the opportunity arise. Lloyd's Register for 1795 shows her master changing from Musgrave to \\"J. Manning\\". and her trade changing to London-Africa.Lloyd's Register (1795), Seq. №411. Marman sailed Sugar Cane from London on 29 July 1795, bound for he Gold Coast.Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database: Sugar Cane. She arrived at Cape Coast Castle on 21 September. She gathered her slaves there and arrived 5 January 1796 at Montevideo, in the Rio de la Plata. She had embarked 249 slaves, and disembarked 228, for a loss rate of 8.4%. She arrived back at London on 10 June. Marman received a second letter of marque on 1 July 1796. Sugar Cane, with Marman, master, then sailed to the Gold Coast again to gather slaves. She arrived at Cape Coast Castle on 30 September. On her way, Sugar Cane recaptured Harlequin, which the French had captured as she was sailing from Liverpool to Africa. Sugar Cane sent Harlequin into Cape Coast.Lloyd's List, no.2896, - accessed 8 February 2015.Williams (1897), p.343. Shortly thereafter, the French captured Sugar Cane as she was sailing from Africa to Barbadoes.Lloyd's List, no.2916, - accessed 8 February 2015. Sugar Cane had embarked 359 slaves, and her captors disembarked 328, for a loss rate of 8.6%. In 1797 Lloyd's Register still showed Sugar Cane, Manning, master, with trade Liverpool-Africa.Lloyd's Register (1797), Seq. №369. Recapture and subsequent career The French renamed Sugar Cane Marseilloise (or Marsellois). However, in October 1797 and recaptured Marsellois as she was sailing from Guadeloupe to France. They then took the richly-laden former Sugar Cane into Martinique.Lloyd's List, n°2968. Sugar Cane was restored to her former owners, who revived her name. Although there is a report that she was loaned out to transport convicts, there is no record of that. A Sugarcane, Campbell, master, did arrive at Port Jackson on 15 October 1798 with a cargo of provisions. She then sailed for India, no date of departure being given. Sugar Cane is no longer listed in the 1798 Lloyd's Register.

Thrissur (Kerala): CosmoBooks, 2013. 100-101 and 113-114.  Background  It seems that king Parantaka I anticipated a climatic battle with the Rashtrakutas and their allies in Tirumunaippati Nadu. Sometime in the 930s, or perhaps as early as 923 AD,South Indian Inscriptions 7 (1932), No. 1009. prince Rajaditya was sent with a substantial military contingent, including elephants and horses, as well as his entire household, to the region (to protect the northern edges of a nascent Chola state). The prince was joined in Tirumunaippati Nadu by his mother and his half-brother Arinjaya (whose mother also might have been from the Chera Perumal family).  Battle at Takkolam  The Rashtrakuta contingent at Takkolam included a collection of feudal militias and royal soldiers (from Western Gangas, Banas and Vaidumbas among others). Prince Rajaditya was supported by a number of military personnel from Kerala (Chera) chiefdoms. An account of the battle, which differs in some details from the Chola version, is found in the Atakur inscription issued by Krishna III and prince Butuga (a young underlord of Krishna III) of the Western Ganga family. According to the inscription, during the battle, Rajaditya was struck while seated atop his war elephant by an arrow from prince Butuga.Epigraphia Indica 6 (1900–01), no. 6c: 53–56. The Chola prince died instantly. The Chola army was subsequently defeated and retreated in disorder.  Consequences  The collapse of the Chola resistance after the battle of Takkolam lead to the virtual destruction of the Chola empire. The Rashtrakutas conquered eastern and northern parts of the Chola empire and advanced to Rameswaram. As per the Karhad copper plates of Krishna II, dated 959 AD, the king \\"uprooted the Cholas, distributed their territory among his followers, and extracted tribute from the Chera (Kerala) and Pandya kings\\" during his campaign. As per historians, the defeat at Takkolam reversed the substantial political gains made by Parantaka Chola in previous decades. It opened the way for a period of multiple (and perhaps even disputed) Chola accessions.Nilakantha Sastri, Cōḷas, 140–67. The Chola royals remained in confusion, and perhaps continued a precarious political existence under the threat of Rashtrakuta invasion.

The Gundagai area is part of the traditional lands of the Wiradjuri speaking people before and post European settlement, and also holds national significance to Indigenous Australians. The floodplains of the Murrumbidgee below the present town of Gundagai were a frequent meeting place of Wiradjuri speaking people from nearby regions. One indication of the ancient, sacred cultural landscape that is North Gundagai is the bora ring that has been identified close to town. The location of Gundagai on a sizeable prehistoric highway, (the Murrumbidgee River), along with the significant and sacred Aboriginal ceremonial ground across all of North Gundagai, and other ancient archaeology, indicates it would have been an important ceremonial, mining, manufacturing and trading place for Aboriginal people before the arrival of the Europeans.Kabaila, P. (2005), 'High Country Footprints: Aboriginal pathways and movement in the high country of southeastern Australia: Recognising the ancient paths beside modern highways', Pirion Publishing Canberra As with all ancient sacred places, particularly within still continuing Australian Aboriginal culture, the sacredness of Gundagai's amazing Australian Aboriginal cultural landscape continues despite colonial and later intrusion. Gundagai Aboriginal Elders, Jimmy Clements and John Noble, attended the 1927 opening of the new Federal Parliament House in Canberra by the Duke of York (later George VI.) Jimmy Clements also known as King Billy whose traditional name was 'Yangar', walked forward to respectfully salute the Duke and Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother), and after that the two Elders were formally presented to the Royal couple as prominent citizens of Australia. Australian dialogue meeting Aboriginal leaders Pat Dodson and Noel Pearson; the former Chief of the Australian Army and Governor of Western Australia, Lieutenant General John Sanderson; and current Australian business leaders, met at a remote property on the Murrumbidgee River near Gundagai in September 2008 on the first stages of an Australian Dialogue to promote constitutional reform and structural change for Indigenous Australian people. Galarrwuy Yunupingu, Northern Territory Indigenous leader, could not be at the gathering of esteemed senior Australians but was kept informed of the progress of talks.Rintoul, S. 12 September 2008 'Dialogue gets under way at indigenous leaders' retreat' The Australian, http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24332900-5013172,00.html Natural phenomena A feeling of awe and reverence for that Almighty power that formed the universe was had in Gundagai at the appearance of the comet on Saturday 21 December 1844. In 1859 the 'Aurora Australis' interfered with the operation of the Gundagai electric telegraph. So great can be some rainfall downpours at Gundagai that old mining dams have been known to fill and burst. A meteor seen at Gundagai on New Year's Day, 1876 was reported to have lit up the streets as though with magnesium wire, and over four inches of rain fell in two hours during a dreadful storm at Gundagai in 1885. Very deep snowfalls and severe weather were experienced in 1899. Similar to other inland areas in Australia, the Gundagai area has often been visited by tornadoes, particularly in dry times. There has also been numerous reports of earth tremors rattling through Gundagai since European settlement. Struck by lightning During a thunderstorm near Gundagai in 1876, an electric fire-ball was seen to issue from the clouds, strike the earth, and explode with a loud noise, singeing Constable Macalister's hair and whiskers, and leaving a blue mark on his side. A terrific thunderstorm at Gundagai in March 1877 set fire to the inside of Armour's house. In November 1899, a man named Caigan was struck by lightning and killed as he sheltered in a hollow log. A boy, Patrick Vaughan, was struck by lightning in October 1904 and rendered unconscious for a long time. Two horses were struck by lightning in 1904 and one horse died. A few weeks later two boys were struck by lightning as they hid under a bullock hide strung over a wire fence. The electric charge travelled along the fence wire. In 1938 two dead drovers were found under a tree south of Gundagai, again the victims of lightning. Lightning killed a horse in 1946 but the rider escaped with her life though somewhat injured. A bushfire that caused a lot of damage was started near Gundagai in February 1906 after lightning hit a tree. John Bloomquist, who was camped in a hollow tree on the Gundagai Golf links, was horribly burned and died when the tree was struck by lightning in 1932. There has been other victims of lightning in the Gundagai area due to the ferocity of thunderstorms that can happen locally. Etymology and dindsenchas Some believe the name 'Gundagai' derives from the word 'Gundagair', an 1838 pastoral run in the name of William HutchinsonRJE Gormly Index, Letter from the Deputy Surveyor-General, 22 January 1838, in 'Gundagai A Track Winding Back', Cliff Butcher, 2002, A.C. Butcher, Gundagai, p.11 to the immediate north of current day Gundagai. 'Gair' was recorded at Yass in 1836 by George Bennett (naturalist) and means 'bird', as in budgerigar or good bird. In that context 'Gundagai' means place of birds but that placename may refer to the area to the north of Gundagai not to Gundagai town. The word 'Gundagai' is also said to mean cut with a hand-axe behind the knee. Combining the two meanings results in the place of birds near where there is a large bend in the Murrumbidgee River that was caused by a cut in the back of the knee. This meaning presupposes that for there to be a knee there is a leg and a body which there is. There is a large anthropomorphic figure in the landscape at Gundagai.easily viewed on any map of the area e.g. Tumut Geological Series Sheet 8527, Edition 1, 1990, Department of Minerals and Energy under the authority of the Minister for Minerals and Energy, 1990. The figure has a kangaroo or dog-like head and is several kilometres in length. It has hindquarters similar to that of an emu but with a long tail and it appears to be sitting on a bend in the river that has a box shape. The image faces to the west and its head is near the Dog on the Tuckerbox area at Gundagai. This primary landscape figure marked out by the course of the Murrumbidgee River at Gundagai, is replicated in some Sydney Rock Engravings and recorded in local Aboriginal cultural heritage. The 'Gundagai' placename meaning further refers to the reason for the bend in the Murrumbidgee River near the Gundagai showground at Gundagai and to the mythological landscape epic at Gundagai. Bunyips, understood to be where streams flood out of their usual channel in wet seasons flooding surrounding land but also drowning anyone caught on the wrong side of them, are recorded on the Gundagai floodplain; opposite 'Kimo'; and at the junction of the Tumut and Murrumbidgee rivers.identified in Parkes, W.

The area is also identified as Jones Creek diorite. 'Kimo' is 'Mt Kimo', named for one of the Nereids, (Nereids, Cymatolege or 'Kymo''Mythagora' ), that occupies the midpoint of the 'Kimo Range', facing Gundagai High School. 'Kimo' is also known as Nargun.

Mount Minerva is the old name for what today is the hill known as 'Minjary'. Oak groves and muses featured in some succeeding cultural depictions of Gundagai no doubt assigned by early settlers who had received the benefits of an education in the classics, such as Charles Tompson, claimed to be Australia's first published native-born poet and whose father had possession of a large tract of land at Gundagai in the 1830s; and James Macarthur son of John Macarthur, Australian wool pioneer, who met up with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in EuropeMacarthur, J. 1828, Interview with Goethe, p.181, James Macarthur, in 'Quadrant Volume 12', 1968, H.R.

Gundagai also has a 'Shakespeare Terrace' that runs along the Murrumbidgee floodplain below the town that may or may not refer to the amazing grand theatre corroborees that happened in that area, eagerly shared in the 1830s for the benefit of overlanders and travellers; or in reference to several or all works of Shakespeare. Placenames such as that of Virgil Street that ascends Gundagai's Mount Parnassus lead to sites in the local landscape that for example invoke Virgil's 'Aeneid', viz ... there the fearsome cavern of the awesome Sybil lies, Whence came her prophecies. The name 'Warramore', is given for Stuckey's Station in 1836 at today's Gundagai.Horton, J., (1838), 'Six Months in South Australia: Ride of Six Hundred Miles From Sydney to Melbourne Through the District of Illawarra', J. Cross, London, pp. 175–194. Available [online] http://www.ozhistorymine.com/html/t__horton_james__1838.html 'Warramore' is linked to 'Warrawen', which is the large cut in the western side of the Monaro Plateau from near which western travelling geological fault lines begin, and 'Warragong', which is the section of the beginning of the Australian Alps in the Gundagai region upon which snow sometimes falls. The junction of the Murrumbidgee and Tumut Rivers is named 'Bewuck' to note the numerous Murray Cod found in that area. As Gundagai is a place of significant Irish, Scottish and English settlement post the arrival of the Europeans, Celtic and English landscape understanding or dindsenchas is also evident at Gundagai. The story of the 'Ghost of Kimo Hill', (in 'Gundagai Ghosts' below), is one example of this. Gundagai Shire Council also had a ward system of Municipal Governance till recent times. but is now composed of eight councillors elected proportionally. 'West Ward' at Gundagai is still delineated by West Street. The ward system originates from Scotland and Eastern England where wards, that are watchful spirits that protect settlements from internal troubles and external dangers, ... form nightly a ring of benevolent spiritual protection against harmful spirits. Once the spirits are driven from the landscape, the protection is no longer forthcoming and the settlement is open to psychic ills.Pennick, N., (1996), 'Celtic Sacred Landscapes', Thames and Hudson, Great Britain, p. 134. Beating the Bounds, the religious form of wards, is still practised in some parishes in the Anglican Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn.The Rural Ministry Task Force Diocese of Canberra Goulburn, 2009, Anglican News, Beating the Bounds develops unity among worship centres', Vol 26, No 6, August 2009, The Newspaper of the Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn, p.11 Available [online] http://sharepoint.anglicancg.org.au/Publib/Documents/Media/Anglican%20News/Anglican%20News%20August%202009.pdf Cursed is he who transgresseth the bounds or doles of his neighbour.Tate, W.

The Right Reverend Trevor Edwards Vicar General of the Anglican Church and Assistant Bishop of the Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn, commented in September 2011, on the stories held within the walls of St John's Church Gundagai when he led the commemoration of the laying of the foundation stone of that church in 1861Gundagai Independent, Sheridan Street Gundagai, Thursday 29 September 2011, p.1. Outside the walls of the St John's church at Gundagai are also the stories of multiple events and aspects of culture not the least the two oak trees outside the Anglican Rectory. Gundagai's rich history of song, verse, epic sagas and notable events beginning first with that of Australian Aboriginal cultural heritage then on to multiple other ontologies with the arrival of the Europeans; that are also remembered within placenames and recalled throughout landscape is evidence of the rich tapesty that is Gundagai today. George Augustus Robinson, Chief Protector of Aborigines in Port Phillip, commented that Gundagai was remarkable for its nomenclature when passing through the town in 1844.George Augustus Robinson 'Report of a Journey of two thousand two hundred miles to the Tribes of the Coast and Eastern Interior during the year 1844', ca.1844, MLMSS 7335, State Library of NSW, Available [online] http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/_transcript/2010/D04795/a2078.pdf Bunyips The Murrumbidgee River at Gundagai has been a place of numerous bunyip sightings. Snake Tales Snakes do unusual things at Gundagai such as the eastern brown snake that removed itself from the stomach of a red- bellied black snake after the red-belly black had eaten it. George Bennett, English born Australian physician and naturalist, recorded at Gundagai in the 1830s that the black snake was the wife of the brown so that may have meant in the biblical sense.Bennett, George (1834). Wanderings in New South Wales, Batavia, Pedir Coast, Singapore and China: being the journal of a naturalist in those countries, during 1832, 1833 and 1834 (Vol. 1) London: Richard Bentley, University of Hong Kong Libraries, Digital Initiatives, China Through Western Eyes In 1908 there was a snake plague at Gundagai with several crawling around the main street and one entering the barber's shop. In 1924 an eastern brown snake that had hidden under a home, was enticed out after 'Yes, We have No Bananas', 'The Road to Gundagai' and finally 'Come into the Garden Maud', were played on the harmonica. A man was bitten on the finger by a snake in 1929 but couldn't get the snake to let go. His dog eventually dragged the snake away. The man chopped his finger off and survived. Also in 1929, Hubert Opperman famous cyclist, had a tiger snake encounter at Gundagai. The efforts of Yarri, Jacky Jacky, and two other Indigenous men Jackie Douglas and Tommy Davis in saving many Gundagai people from the 1852 floodwaters were heroic. Between them, these men rescued more than 40 people using bark canoes. Yarri and Jacky Jacky were honoured with bronze medallions for their efforts, and were allowed to demand sixpences from all Gundagai residents, although Yarri was maltreated on at least one occasion after the flood.Gundagai Times, 29 June 1879, as cited in It is claimed that the Gundagai community developed a special affinity with the Wiradjuri people and that the flood and its aftermath was the birthplace of reconciliation. Spirit Dog, Djirri Djirris, Killimicat Craypton and Ghosts To the east of Gundagai, local Aboriginal cultural tradition traditionally ran downstream into the Murrumbidgee, then on to Gundagai rather than upstream to Tumut.'Parkes, W. 1952, Letter to Tindale from Parkes, Noel Butlin Archives Centre, ANU Manuscript Collection, database 162, p.96 As well as bunyip stories, Brungle Aboriginal women relate the story of the 'Mirriyolla Dog' a spirit dog that could shapeshift. Willie wagtails or djirri djirris were known to listen into conversations so it was wise to not repeat confidences. A man with no head called 'Craypton' lived up on 'Killimicat' and would ride down the mountain of a night on a horse. The blue glow of the Min Min light sometimes identified as a fata morgana phenomenon, is also known in the Gundagai area and Aboriginal people were taught to run if they saw it.Department of Environment and Conservation NSW, 2004, 'Aboriginal Women's Heritage: Brungle and Tumut', Department of Environment and Conservation NSW, p.42. Also available [online] http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/nswcultureheritage/AboriginalWomensHeritageBrungleTumut.htm The Mirriyolla Ghost Dog is also known of in Cootamundra a few miles to the north-west of Gundagai and lives in the Bethungra Range that is partly in Gundagai Shire. This ghost dog hunts on just one night a year, the longest night. Gundagai has recorded several ghost and will-o'-the-wisp sightings. Will-O'-the-Wisp is Will the Smith. Will is a wicked blacksmith who is given a second chance by Saint Peter at the gates to Heaven, but leads such a bad life that he ends up being doomed to wander the Earth. The Devil provides him with a single burning coal with which to warm himself, which he then used to lure foolish travellers into the marshes. One tall and shadowy ... supernatural visitant that appeared from under a culvert in Gundagai in 1869, severely alarmed a horse and its rider, and exhibited a livid, phosphoric light such as a rotting fish might display. Mrs Moroney at Jones Creek, Gundagai, was often visited by a ghost in 1873. The ghost wore a grey tweed suit and had a red beard. Sometimes one-half of him would appear to those he chose to favour with his presence, and at other times, the other half was seen. Mrs Moroney spoke to her clergyman and also the Bishop and then vacated her residence. A nearby resident, Mr Carey, then began to receive visits by the same spectre. Mr Carey corroborated Mrs Moroney's description of the ghost and dealt with it by hitting it on the head with a shovel the next time it paid him a visit. The shovel bounced off so next Mr Carey set the dogs on it and the ghost retreated through the doorway. Co-founder of the Gundagai Museum, Oscar Bell, British Empire Medal recipient for services to the community including preserving and recording Gundagai history, and President of the Gundagai and District Historical Society, told of the ghost of a little old woman that alarmed a newly arrived in Australia, Irish pastoral worker named Dennis Kilker. A ghost of the same description, (which may have been a Cailleach, or Washer at the Ford also known as a Bean Nighe, given the Celtic mythological elements in the story), was also reported by a tourist named Ryan who passed through the area in the 1960s. Bell then went on to remember the ghost of Kimo Hill, a couple of miles to the south of Gundagai, that is thought to belong to a lost or stolen child who went missing in the area, in the 1830s.Bell, O., (ndg – possibly 1970s), 'Tales of Old Gundagai' No.3, B.E.M. President of the Gundagai and District Historical Society, Wilkie Watson Publications, Tumut, p.50.

More recently a Gundagai resident saw a ghost at the old Gundagai Gaol and wrote a song about her.ABC Country, 2010, Kerryn, Available [online] http://abccountry.net.au/users/kerryn In 1923, a Ghost Ball was held in the Gundagai hall with dancers clad in white costume. Gundagai also has a long and strong oral tradition of folklore particular to place that in no small way is due to the site of Gundagai and its many thousands of years long occupation by Australian Aboriginal people being the original foundation population that holds continuing traditional custodianship of place. In turn, as a direct result of colonialism by England from the 1800s onward, the current culturally diverse Celtic and Anglo-Saxon origin dominant in numbers population evolved at Gundagai at high cost to the original inhabitants.

University of the Philippines. While at the University of the Philippines, he was initiated into the Upsilon Sigma Phi. He attended the EC-ASEAN Teacher Program on the Management of Strategic and Organizational Change at the INSEAD Euro-Asia Centre in Fontainebleau, France. Career Academe His early career was spent teaching at the Department of Chemistry of the University of the Philippines College of Science as an instructor. He also taught at the Ateneo de Manila University's departments of management engineering and business management as a part-time lecturer for over four years. He later became the American Express Foundation Professor of Financial Management from 1980 to 1989, chair of the Master of Business Management program, and director of the Advanced Bank Management program at the Asian Institute of Management (AIM). Business and finance Pascual was department manager in Procter and Gamble, project manager in Bancom Development Corporation, Assistant vice- president in Philippine Pacific Capital Corporation (now RCBC Capital), and vice president in First Metro Investment Corporation. From 1989 to 2008, Pascual worked in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as a senior investment officer in the private sector department. He then became director of its Private Sector Infrastructure Finance Division and its Capital Markets & Finance Sectors Division. Pascual later served as advisor on public-private partnership in infrastructure. He had postings in ADB's resident offices in New Delhi, India and Jakarta, Indonesia. He also represented ADB on the corporate board of the Mutual Fund Company of the Philippines and other corporations in China, India, Hong Kong, and the Netherlands. As U.P. president Dr. Pascual emerged as the victor among the 11 nominees for the presidency of the University of the Philippines in 2011.Lapeña, C. G. (2010, December 3). Poll automation watchdog elected UP's 20th president. GMA News Online Some of the other nominees were: School of Economics professor and former Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno, former College of Law dean and Inquirer publisher Raul Pangalangan, National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) chair and former university vice president for academic affairs Ma. Serena Diokno, former Department of English & Comparative Literature chair Consolacion Alaras, former chancellors Sergio Cao of University of the Philippines Diliman and Luis Rey Velasco of University of the Philippines Los Banos, and Social Weather Stations fellow and School of Labor and Industrial Relations professor Virginia Teodosio. In the academic sphere, Pascual made significant strides in transforming U.P. into a research- intensive university, raising its international profile as a global university, and strengthening its role in national development as a public service university. He gave priority to creating the enabling conditions needed for achieving these objectives. To intensify research, he launched new research initiatives (e.g., Philippine Genome Center (PGC) in 2011, Emerging Interdisciplinary Research in 2012, U.P. Resilience Institute in 2016). He funded the building of modern laboratories (e.g., P1 billion National Institutes of Health building and the P350 million PGC complex). He sent more faculty members for advanced research studies abroad; incentivized the return to U.P. of Filipino PhDs from foreign institutions; and enhanced the rewards for research outputs. He created the Technology Transfer and Business Development Office (TTBDO) to institutionalize efforts to commercialize intellectual properties (IPs) resulting from research for the benefit of the researchers and the university. Recognizing the role of the arts and humanities in developing a sense of national identity and unity among Filipinos, Mr. Pascual implemented the Cultural Infrastructure Development Program (CIDP) in 2014 with government funding of close to P400 million. CIDP provided the funding for the rehabilitation and upgrading of cultural facilities in various campuses for performing arts and creative works. To internationalize U.P., Pascual initiated in 2014 the shift of the U.P. academic calendar to an August start in order to synchronize it with its partner universities in ASEAN and in other parts of the world. He launched the programs for student exchange (MOVE U.P.), and for research collaboration by faculty and postgraduate students (COOPERATE). More funds were made available for international travel grants for paper presentation, and for bringing to U.P. eminent world leaders under the World Expert Lecture Series. He introduced international quality assurance of degree programs to benchmark U.P. against the best in the region. To strengthen public service, he created the U.P. Padayon Public Service Office which organized disaster relief operations and provided training in disaster management, among others. He pursued arrangements for U.P. to provide technical assistance and policy studies support to government departments and offices, local government units, and other public universities. launched the U.P. Television on the Internet (TVUP) to fill the vacuum of reliable and university-based TV programs in the country. The university also entered into an agreement with the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Network, known as the \\"Fact-Check\\" project for faculty members to appear regularly in forums related to the 2013 Philippine general election. Pascual created over 800 One-U.P. Professorial Chairs and Faculty Grants in 2015. That was the first time ever in U.P. for such a big number was made available in one go – overcoming the very limited supply of donated professorial chairs. These are annual grants awarded for three years, renewable based on performance. The objective is to recognize more deserving faculty members for excellence in research, teaching, and public service. In the area of finance and administration, Pascual raised for U.P. substantial resources through government budget allocations, donations, and revenue- generating projects. When he assumed the U.P. Presidency, funding from the government was declining. But he campaigned for and succeeded in getting big increases in government funding for U.P. The U.P. budget for operating expenses, in particular, has quadrupled. Around P12 billion has been allocated for modernizing the physical and cyber infrastructure of U.P. campuses (funding about 100 new buildings and 50 major renovations) and upgrading the hospital equipment of the Philippine General Hospital (PGH). Among the major donations that Pascual got for U.P. are the land and the building for the new U.P. Bonifacio Global City (UP-BGC) campus from the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) and a business group, respectively. Now operational, UP-BGC provides those working in BGC and nearby areas convenient access to U.P.’s professional programs in law, business, industrial engineering, statistics, etc. Other donations are (a) a 400-seat theater in U.P. Diliman from a businessman alumnus; (b) a completed 4-storey dormitory in U.P. Manila donated from a fraternity and a sorority; (c) a 70-hectare site for a U.P. campus in the New Clark City in Tarlac from BCDA; (d) a 5-hectare site and academic building for the U.P. Alabang technology hub donated from an alumni family; and (e) a 3-hectare site and a building from a Mindanao-based business group for an extension campus of U.P. Los Baños in Panabo City. Pascual forged partnerships with the private sector to build revenue- generating projects, such as the U.P. Town Center in Diliman. The commercial center generates hundreds of millions of pesos annually for the university, which are used to fund programs not eligible for government funding (e.g., enhanced personnel benefits for retirement and hospitalization). Pascual rolled out e-UP, a system-wide integrated information system designed to achieve administrative efficiency, sharpen decision making, and strengthen control. The project included substantial investments in hardware, fiber optic networks, and internet bandwidth to also support the academic requirements of faculty and students. Affiliations Pascual was the lead convenor of the Automated Election System (AES) Watch, an independent, multi-sector coalition that monitored and assessed the Philippines’ first ever nationwide poll automation in May 2010. He served as trustee of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), and as Chairperson of the U.P. Foundation and the U.P. Provident Fund, among others. Currently, Pascual is a governor of the Management Association of the Philippines (MAP), a Life Member of the Financial Executives Institute of the Philippines (FINEX), and the president of the Rotary Club of Makati. Awards Pascual's accomplishments as U.P. President were recognized with the Presidential Lingkod Bayan Award in 2014 from the Philippine President, the Rotary Golden Wheel Award for Higher Education in 2013, and the Lifetime Distinguished Achievement Award from the U.P.

He became a professor and head of the chemistry department at the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts (now the University of New Hampshire) in Durham, New Hampshire, USA. James developed the James method for the separation and identification of rare-earth elements by fractional precipitation and crystallization, and provided extracted elements to researchers worldwide. James was one of the first scientists to identify element 71, later named lutetium, and believed that he had found the final rare earth element 61, later named promethium. In 1999 the American Chemical Society recognized Charles James's work in chemical separations as a National Historic Chemical Landmark. Early life Charles James was born on 27 April 1880 to William James and Mary Diana Shatford-James at Earls Barton near Broughton, Northamptonshire. His father died when he was six and he was brought up by his mother. He attended school in Wellinborough, taking classes through Cambridge University. His father's chemistry books sparked his interest in chemistry, and he built himself a home laboratory when he was 15. He also began a correspondence with renowned chemist William Ramsay, who encouraged his interest and became a life-long mentor to James. Oxford and Cambridge did not teach chemistry at that time. His family opposed his choice of chemistry as a career, but finally gave way. In 1899, James went to University College London where he studied under William Ramsay. James won the Ramsay silver medal in 1901. He passed examinations to become an associate of the Institute of Chemistry in 1904, and a fellow in 1907. Career In 1906, James accepted a position at the National Refining Company in West Chester, New York. Once in the United States, he was offered an assistant professorship in chemistry by Charles Parsons, at New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts in Durham, New Hampshire. Founded in 1866 by chemist Ezekiel Dimond, the school's main focus was chemistry. Parsons was a founder of the national American Chemical Society, and Parsons and James were founding members of a national chemistry fraternity: Alpha Chi Sigma. In 1911, Parsons moved to the U.S. Bureau of Mines. James became a full professor and succeeded Parsons as head of the chemistry department at New Hampshire College. In 1915, James married Marion Templeton. Their only child, Marion James, became a historian of ancient Greece and Rome, and an art collector. In addition to his work, Charles James became an avid gardener, specializing in delphinium propagation. He also became a beekeeper, and an expert on the social life of bees. Research James was interested in the group of elements called the rare earths, particularly the lanthanides. He published more than 60 papers in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. The James Method He developed specialized techniques for the fractional precipitation and crystallization of the rare earths. The James Method, using bromates and double magnesium nitrates in fractional crystallization was widely used until the 1940s when Ion Exchange methods were developed. James himself became the major producer of extracted rare earth materials, supplying elements and compounds to researchers worldwide. His collection of rare earths was sold to the National Bureau of Standards after his death. It has since been returned to the University of New Hampshire, where it is the James Collection of Rare Earth Compounds, in the Department of Chemistry. Lutetium Ytterbium Purified lutetium During 1906-1907, James prepared a substantial amount of highly purified lutetia, identifying it as a rare earth element that had not previously been extracted. Because he did not publish his results immediately, two other chemists published their own methods and results for the extraction of the new element before him: Georges Urbain and Carl Auer von Welsbach. All three scientists successfully separated ytterbia into the oxides of two elements, which were eventually named ytterbium and lutetium). None of these chemists were able to isolate pure lutetium, although James' separation was of very high quality. Promethium As early as 1913, James was involved in searching for element 61, the last of the rare earth elements. At least seven times, investigators believed that they had identified element 61. Charles James and B. Smith Hopkins from the University of Illinois both sought it. In 1926, himself close to publishing on the subject, James was asked to review a paper from Hopkins for the Journal of the American Chemical Society. James subsequently sent his own paper on element 61 to the lesser-known Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences to avoid any possible conflict of interest. As a result it received less attention than might have been expected. It is likely that neither chemist was aware of the other's work before James reviewed Hopkins' paper. James also reviewed Hopkinsʼs book Chemistry of the Rarer Elements, saying he recommended it. Eventually it was determined that promethium, a radioactive element, does not form stable isotopes. As a result, it is extremely rare and unlikely to occur in nature, but can be formed in a nuclear reactor. Thulium Thulium James determined that thulium, thought to be a mixture of three substances, was really a single element. James was the first researcher to isolate nearly pure thulium. In 1911 he reported his results, having used the method he discovered for bromate fractional crystallization to do the purification. He famously needed 15,000 purification operations to establish that the material was homogeneous. Honors * 1901, Ramsay Silver Medal * 1912, William H. Nichols Medal, New York Section of the American Chemical Society * 1999, Laboratory recognized as a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society * 2000, inducted into the Alpha Chi Sigma Hall of Fame Death By 1928, James was terminally ill. He died on 10 December 1928. There is a legend, captured by John Greenleaf Whittier in the poem, \\"Telling the bees,\\" which explains that someone must tell the bees of their master's death or they will fly away. James died in the winter, so he could not be buried in the intended cemetery plot until the spring. He was then buried in the desired plot. A day or two later a swarm of bees appeared at the grave. The bees belonged to Jesse Hepler, who lived two miles away. They had been given to him by James. No one told the James-Hepler bees of James' death, and, as in the legend, they flew away. Miraculously they flew to the grave of their former master, two miles away.

It was written by consulting producer Jane Espenson, and was directed by Michael Waxman. Espenson wrote it to give viewers some \\"crucial facts\\" about Rumpelstiltskin's origins. Guest stars included Brad Dourif, Giancarlo Esposito, Beverley Elliott, Ty Olsson, Meghan Ory, and Dylan Schmid. The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \\"real world\\" town by a powerful curse. In this episode, Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) runs for Sheriff against Regina's (Lana Parrilla) candidate, Sidney Glass (Esposito). Meanwhile, in the episode's flashbacks, Rumpelstiltskin's (Robert Carlyle) backstory is revealed. \\"Desperate Souls\\" first aired in the United States on ABC on January 8, 2012. Its broadcast was watched by an estimated 10.35 million viewers, a 29 percent increase from the previous episode. Television critics gave mostly positive reviews to the episode; most praised Carlyle's performance, but one noted that the storytelling was beginning to \\"feel stale.\\" Plot Opening sequence Zoso is shown in the forest. In Storybrooke It has been two weeks since Sheriff Graham's (Jamie Dornan) death, and the citizens of Storybrooke continue to mourn. Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) convinces Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) she ought to be sheriff, but Regina (Lana Parrilla) has already appointed Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito) for the job. Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) suspects Regina is responsible for Graham's death and starts to believe good cannot defeat evil because good plays by the rules. Gold offers Emma his support and reveals to her the town charter which states the Mayor can only choose a candidate for Sheriff and therefore an election must be held. Emma decides to run, so Regina declares Sidney Glass will as well. Henry becomes worried when he finds out Gold is Emma's benefactor, considering how dangerous it is to owe him one favor, let alone two. Regina is furious that Gold would work against her. Gold's plan was to set a fire at the Mayor's office with Emma there, knowing her conscience would force her to save Regina and look like a hero. This goes off perfectly, making Emma the town favorite going into the debate. When she finds out that Gold did this, Emma realizes Henry might be right about evil not playing by the rules. At the debate, Sidney explains what would make him the best sheriff following Regina's script to the letter. Emma reveals to the public that Gold set the fire, demonstrating her own honesty and integrity as well as Gold's ruthlessness. Later that evening at Granny's Cafe, Emma consoles herself with liquor when Henry walks in with the walkie talkies, saying that he was proud of her and they might continue \\"Operation Cobra.\\" Regina, Archie (Raphael Sbarge), Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Sidney arrive to tell Emma she was elected Sheriff. Regina gives her the badge and admits they have one thing in common: their distrust of Gold. Emma receives a visit from her new ally who reveals the rest of his plan. Gold knew Emma would do the right thing and tell everyone what he did, winning her the election. He also tells her that while the town feared Regina, they feared him more. In standing up to him, Emma became even more compelling to the townsfolk than when she rescued Regina. Now that Emma is Sheriff, Gold expects to be paid back for his favors. In the characters' past In the Enchanted Forest, Rumpelstiltskin's (Carlyle) backstory is revealed. During the ogre wars, the children that live in the Frontlands are conscripted to military service at age 14. The Duke's men gather young soldiers with the help of \\"The Dark One\\" who possesses great magical power. Rumpelstiltskin's son, Baelfire (Dylan Schmid), will turn 14 in three days and he is desperate to keep his child out of battle. As father and son flee from the village, they are confronted by the Duke's men. They mock Rumpelstiltskin for running away when he was supposed to serve, and reveal that his cowardice caused his wife to leave him. Rumpelstiltskin begs for his son's life but he has nothing to offer but fealty. The Duke's chief soldier commands Rumpelstiltskin to kiss his boot, but when the desperate man bends down the soldier kicks him to the ground. The old beggar (Brad Dourif) by the side of the road sees this and offers the pair assistance since they spared him a coin. The beggar tells Rumpelstiltskin a secret, the Duke possesses a dagger that allows him to command The Dark One and all his power. If Rumpelstiltskin steals the dagger, he will control The Dark One himself. If he kills The Dark One with the dagger, he will possess his magic. Rumpelstiltskin sets fire to the Duke's castle (in a parallel with Mr. Gold's actions) and steals the dagger which reads the name of The Dark One, \\"Zoso\\". Baelfire is worried about his father's plan to wield the dagger's power but Rumpelstiltskin just sends him home. Rumpelstiltskin summons Zoso and declares he is The Dark One's master. Zoso is not impressed and wonders aloud what the timid little man would have him do. Rumpelstiltskin's answer is \\"Die!\\" He kills The Dark One who reveals himself to be the beggar from before. Zoso laughs and tells Rumpelstiltskin that \\"All magic comes with a price.\\" Rumpelstiltskin becomes the new Dark One and his name is now inscribed on the dagger. He returns home and uses his power to save his son from the Duke's men. Baelfire is terrified of this man who no longer seems like his father at all. Production Consulting producer Jane Espenson wrote \\"Desperate Souls,\\" her second such credit for the series. \\"Desperate Souls\\" was written by consulting producer Jane Espenson, while Friday Night Lights veteran Michael Waxman served as director. The episode was Espenson's second writing credit for the series at that point. She intended the episode to reveal \\"some crucial facts about where Rumpel comes from,\\" believing him to be \\"a wild card\\" whose \\"ulterior motives are still always very complicated.\\" \\"Desperate Souls\\" partly deals with the aftermath of Sheriff Graham's death from the previous episode. Though her character is associated with evil, actress Lana Parrilla attempted to keep Regina as human as possible. She clarified, \\"You will see how there is a genuine love and care for Graham…There was a physical connection to the character. He did become sort of a boy toy in both worlds. But, you know, at the end of the day, in Storybrooke, she’s still trying to fill this void that Maleficent warned her about.\\" Leading up to the episode broadcast, Parrilla also gave a preview of what viewers could expect. Of the episode's plot, she explained, \\"We will be seeing some dirty politics between Regina and Mr. Gold. You’re going to see how threatening that is to Regina, and, as you know, she really takes on these challenges full force.\\" In early October 2011, TV Guide reported that actor Brad Dourif would be making a guest appearance as a \\"beggar who befriends evil Rumpelstiltskin.\\" Other guest stars included Meghan Ory as Ruby, Patti Allan as Miss Ginger, Beverley Elliott as Granny, Giancarlo Esposito as Sidney, Dylan Schmid as Baelfire, Conner Dwelly as Morraine, Ty Olsson as Hordor, Michael Phenicie as The Duke (scenes deleted), C. Ernst Harth as Burly Man, David-Paul Grove as Doc, and Gabe Khouth as Mr. Clark. The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013. Cultural references Morraine, Baelfire, and the Dark One are inspired by the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. A large Mickey Mouse figurine and small Minnie Mouse figurine are visible during Emma's confrontation with Gold over the fire. Zoso, the name of the Dark One, is a reference to the band Led Zeppelin, as it is a nickname for the guitarist Jimmy Page. Reception Ratings \\"Desperate Souls\\" first aired in the United States on January 8, 2012. It earned a 3.7/8 among 18-49s and an overall 5.9/9 rating, with an estimated 10.35 million viewers. It ranked second in its timeslot, beaten by NFL Overrun on CBS but ahead of Dateline NBC and The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show on Fox. Once Upon a Times ratings were up 28 percent compared to the last original episode. In Canada, the episode finished in eighteenth place for the week with 1.297 million viewers, a decrease from the 1.6 million of the previous episode. Reviews Robert Carlyle's performance was praised by critics. \\"Desperate Souls\\" received mostly positive reviews from television critics. In her first review of the series, Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly expressed her enjoyment of the episode, believing the following week would be \\"pretty difficult to top tonight's ep.\\" Busis praised the final fairytale scenes as \\"intense, effective... [and]... awesome.\\" IGN writer Amy Ratcliffe rated the episode 7/10, giving praise to Robert Carlyle and guest actor Brad Dourif, but criticizing Lana Parrilla's constant \\"dagger stares and pursed lips\\" to Emma. Ratcliffe did however believe Ginnifer Goodwin and Joshua Dallas had \\"electric chemistry,\\" and wished viewers could see more scenes between the two. Like Ratcliffe, Digital Spy columnist Catriona Wightman lauded Parrilla and Carlyle's performances, believing the latter \\"continues to be one of the best things about Once Upon A Time - this completely new version of Rumpelstiltskin we saw was illuminating. Turns out he does cowardly and pathetic quite well.\\" The Huffington Post editor Laura Prudom and TV Fanatic's C. Orlando also highlighted Carlyle's acting and storyline. Prudom liked Dourif's casting, but singled out praise for Mary Margaret and David's poster scene, calling it \\"beautifully written and played, understated and filled with longing.\\" The A.V. Clubs Oliver Sava was more critical of the episode, and graded \\"Desperate Souls\\" with a C. He remarked that Once Upon a Time \\"lacks Losts sophistication and insight, instead laying out plot in the plainest terms possible, no matter how tedious that may be... It hasn’t even been ten episodes, and the formula is already starting to feel stale.\\" Despite this, Sava saw potential for the series, noting that \\"the writers just need to take fuller advantage of the wealth of mythology that the fairy tale stories give them.\\" References External links  Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Once Upon a Time (season 1) episodes Category:Television episodes written by Jane Espenson ","title":"Desperate Souls"},{"id":"34322305","text":"Pseudomonas entomophila is a strain of bacterium that lives in the soil and can infect insects.

The organization continues to fight to protect the bay from development and landfill and to oppose redevelopment of salt flats; it instead encourages their restoration to a natural state. the bay History The organization helped to spark the environmental movement in the United States. The women were successful in saving the bay. They lobbied the state government until state legislation in 1965 established the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission as a state agency. The commission drew up a master plan for San Francisco Bay, which provided for orderly development as well as preservation. It was the first such agency in California and later inspired the creation of the California Coastal Commission. Today The organization still works to protect the wildlife of the Bay Area and water quality of the uniquely large inland body of water.Sylvia McLaughlin, Save the Bay founder, fights on, Peter Fimrite, San Francisco Chronicle, 31-10-2011, access date 10-01-2012 When it was founded it was the first successful regional grassroots campaign to achieve that sort of goal. Save The Bay prevented the destruction of San Bruno Mountain to fill 27 miles (44 km) of the San Mateo County shoreline. The founders' main goal was to preserve the natural beauty of the bay. Their efforts have also been noted as the first successful conservation efforts in an urban area. The women's efforts led to the creation of the Bay Conservation and Development Commission, which was later used as the blueprint and inspiration for other government commissions such as the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, California Coastal Commission, and Delta Stewardship Council.

He briefly attended the University of Arizona and graduated with a B.A. in history and English from Lawrence University, where he was the editor of the campus newspaper. He worked as a general assignment reporter for a succession of newspapers throughout the United States – including the Superior Express, the Wyoming Tribune-Eagle, the Savannah Morning News, The Salt Lake Tribune, the San Francisco Chronicle and The Arizona Republic—before leaving daily journalism altogether to write books. He received an M.A.L.S degree from Dartmouth College and now works as a professor of English at Chapman University.Chapman University Faculty Profile - Tom Zoellner, https://www.chapman.edu/our-faculty/tom-zoellner He lives in Los Angeles.Tom Zoellner - Professor Chapman.edu Professional life His first book was The Heartless Stone: A Journey Through the World of Diamonds, Deceit and Desire (St. Martin’s Press, 2006), an investigative chronicle of the diamond business reported from sixteen nations. Zoellner had to go deeply into debt to do the research for this book, which also told a personal story: the demise of his engagement to a woman in San Francisco and his consequent difficulties in letting go of the diamond ring which had been given back to him. The book was called “a dazzling display of intrepid reporting,” by Entertainment Weekly magazine, and “an illuminating expose of a mineral and an industry,” by The Wall Street Journal'. His follow-up book was Uranium: War Energy and the Rock that Shaped the World (Viking/Penguin, 2009), which took a similar multi-faceted approach to a mineral as his previous look at the diamond business. Zoellner has said it is impossible to understand the true historical effect of an object without seeing its international footprint, as well as the economics, politics, psychology, physics, theology and literature of that object. Uranium was praised by The New York Times and Washington Post, and by The Daily Show host Jon Stewart, who called it “crazy, fascinating.” The book won the 2010 Science Writing Award from the American Institute of Physics. Beginning in 2014, Zoellner was instrumental in gathering support from the Museum of Moab, San Juan County, the Bureau of Land Management, and Mark Steen—son of Charles Steen—for a historic marker commemorating Utah's uranium heritage. The marker is located on the Anticline Overlook road off U.S. 191 and was dedicated on November 4, 2016.http://www.moabtimes.com/view/full_story/27299328/article-New-historical- marker-installed-near-Lisbon-Valley-mine-site-commemorates-region-s-complex- uranium-heritage?instance=home_news_2nd_left Artist Michael Ford Dunton created an arch to frame the historical marker and view of the location of the Mi Vida mine seven miles to the east of the marker. While working as a reporter in Arizona, Zoellner had become friends with future U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was then in the state legislature, and he later worked as a speechwriter and field organizer on her Congressional campaigns. Shortly after Giffords was shot and badly wounded in a January 8, 2011, assassination attempt, Zoellner began writing an explanation of the sociological roots of the event. The manuscript was finished in slightly under 100 days and the resulting book, A Safeway in Arizona: What the Gabrielle Giffords Shooting Tells Us About the Grand Canyon State and Life in America (Viking/Penguin, 2012), was published to mixed reviews. The Boston Globe praised it as “a masterly work of reporting, historical analysis, and sly cultural criticism,” but other reviewers faulted the book for its conclusion that Giffords’ attempted killer had been influenced by a hateful climate in Tucson preceding the 2010 midterm Congressional elections. His next book, Train: Riding the Rails that Created the Modern World, from the Trans-Siberian to the Southwest Chief (Penguin-Random House, 2014) is a return to the multidimensional narrative of international scope. The book was reported via a series of rail journeys in Britain, Spain, Russia, China, India, Peru and across the U.S. and has been praised as “an exuberant celebration” by Booklist, \\"wonderful\\" by The Washington Post, \\"spirited and big-hearted,\\" by the San Francisco Chronicle and \\"engaging\\" and \\"keenly observed\\" by The New York Times'. In 2016, he has since published articles on various facets of train safety and infrastructure. Zoellner is also the co-author of An Ordinary Man (Viking/Penguin, 2006), the autobiography of Paul Rusesabagina, the real-life hotel manager whose story was featured in the film \\"Hotel Rwanda.\\" The book was a New York Times bestseller in hardcover and paperback, and was translated into 14 languages.

Phillip was born in Enfield, United Kingdom, but he grew up in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, where he was a pupil at Cheshunt School. From 1986 to 1989, Phillip studied for a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Media Studies, at what was the Polytechnic of Central London, currently the University of Westminster. Phillip worked as a broadcast radio journalist for BBC Scotland based in Glasgow, having previously worked in London. In 2006, Phillip left the United Kingdom, and immigrated to New Zealand, where he took a position at Radio New Zealand. In 2011, he was a news bulletin editor. He was one of the founding members of a gay immigrant group, \\"Queers Gone Kiwi.\\". Phillip was assaulted in a street attack on Boulcott Street in central Wellington, New Zealand, on 10 December 2011, less than 15 minutes after leaving the Radio New Zealand studios, where he had finished an overnight shift. He died from his injuries at Wellington Hospital on 11 December 2011, at the age of 43 without regaining consciousness. Although Phillip suffered from a degenerative bone disorder, this did not contribute to his death. Two teenagers were charged in connection with his murder. Phillip's funeral took place on 16 December 2011, in Wellington, New Zealand. On 21 January 2012, a memorial service was held for Phillip in Long Sutton, Lincolnshire, United Kingdom. The two men charged with his murder went on trial in December 2012, and both pleaded not guilty. A number of Radio New Zealand staff were due to give evidence. In December 2012 Nicho Allan Waipuka was found guilty of manslaughter while Manuel Renera Robinson was acquitted. Only at sentencing did Waipuka's violent history and the fact that he had almost sentenced to an intensive supervision sentence for charges including assault and threatening to kill just 17 days prior to his assault on Phillip Cottrell come out. Sue Hollow's (Phillip Cottrell's sister) made a victim impact statement. Phillip Cottrell's family, Wellington Central Baptist Church, other local residents, churches & businesses, the Gay & Lesbian community and representatives of Wellington Maori Iwi joined to dedicate a memorial bench & garden in Boulcott Street near where Phillip was assaulted as a tribute and to clearly say that the entire community abhors what happened.

She was the mother of Liao's founder Emperor Taizu of Liao (Yelü Abaoji) and the wife of his father Yelü Saladi (耶律薩剌的). During the reign of Emperor Taizu's son Emperor Taizong, she was grand empress dowager.  Background and marriage to Yelü Saladi  It is not known when Yaonian Yanmujin was born. (She is referred to in traditional historical sources (such as the History of Liao) as Xiao Yanmujin because, according to the History of Liao, Emperor Taizu greatly admired Emperor Gao of Han, and so referred to his own Yelü clan by the name of Liu as well, while he had the names of the traditional wife clans of Yelü chieftains — the most prominent of whom included the Yishi (乙室) and Bali (拔裏) clans — change their names to Xiao (after Emperor Gao's prime minister Xiao He), and thus almost all Liao empresses, both actual and posthumously honored ones, were known by the surname of Xiao.) Yaonian Yanmujin was of the Yaonian clan, and was a daughter of the chancellor Yaonian Tila (遙輦剔剌).History of Liao, vol. 71. At some point, Yaonian Yanmujin married the Yelü chieftain Yelü Saladi. She bore him six children — five of his six sons, including his oldest son Yelü Abaoji, and one daughter.History of Liao, vol. 64.  As empress dowager  After Yelü Abaoji succeeded Yelü Saladi as the Yelü chief, he conquered the other Khitan tribes by force, and by 907, he had declared himself the emperor of a new Khitan Empire (which would later become known as Liao) as its Emperor Taizu. He honored his mother Yaonian Yamujin as empress dowager.History of Liao, vol. 1. Still, despite her honored title, her daughter-in-law Empress Shulü Ping, because of Empress Shulü's own battlefield accomplishments, refused to bow to her (or Empress Shulü's own mother) and instead made them bow to herself, stating, \\"I only bow to Heaven, not to humans.\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. In 913, while Emperor Taizu was away at Lu River (蘆水), he believed that there would be a joint rebellion by his brothers Yelü Diela (耶律迭剌 (whom he had made the King of the Xi)) and Yelü Anduan (耶律安端), and therefore arrested them. When another brother, Yelü Lage (耶律剌葛) heard this, Yelü Lage then arrived at the Khitan headquarters with an army, apparently planning to declare himself emperor. It was at Empress Dowager Yaonian's orders that he departed from the headquarters. His army subsequently pillaged the headquarters but were repelled by Empress Shulü's army, and they subsequently departed. In 919, on an occasion when Emperor Taizu was attacking the Wugu Tribe (烏古), he heard that Empress Dowager Yaonian was ill, and therefore returned to headquarters to attend to her. He resumed the Wugu campaign once she recovered.History of Liao, vol. 2.  As grand empress dowager  In 927, Emperor Taizu died and was succeeded by his son Yelü Deguang (as Emperor Taizong).

When the Cobbs School closed in 1816, the manual method, which used American Sign Language, became commonplace in deaf schools for most of the remainder of the century. In the late 1800s, schools began to use the oral method, which only allowed the use of speech, as opposed to the manual method previously in place. Students caught using sign language in oral programs were often punished. The oral method was used for many years until sign language instruction gradually began to come back into deaf education.  Early history  Before the 1800s, few, if any, educational opportunities existed for deaf children in America. Some wealthy families sent their children to Europe's schools, but many non-high class children had no access to education.  Early oral education in the United States  In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, many wealthy colonists sent their deaf children to Europe to receive schooling. The best known deaf educational institution was the Braidwood Academy in Edinburgh, Scotland, established in 1760 by Thomas Braidwood as the \\"Academy for the Deaf and Dumb.\\" The Braidwood Academy was an expensive private oral school that was very secretive about its methods, only sharing their methodology with a few select people. The Bolling family, who lived in Virginia, were the most prominent colonists to send their deaf children to the Braidwood Academy. Thomas Bolling and his wife Elizabeth Gay (who was also his first cousin) had three deaf children, John, Mary, and Thomas Jr., as well as at least two hearing children. John was the first of the three children to go to the Braidwood Academy in 1771, with Mary and Thomas Jr. arriving later. The three Bolling children arrived back in the United States in 1783; however, they became ill shortly after arriving home, and John died on October 11, 1783. Because of this, it cannot be determined how effective the ten years of oral instruction he received were. Mary and Thomas Jr. lived for at least another four decades, and comments about Thomas Jr. noted that he was a \\"miracle of accomplishments.\\" The next generation of hearing Bollings had deaf children, and they wanted their children to be educated in the United States. William, the last child of Thomas and Elizabeth, married his first cousin Mary, who bore five children, two of whom were deaf. The couple's first deaf child, William Albert, drove his father's desire to create a school for the deaf in America. William Bolling met John Braidwood, a descendant of Thomas Braidwood, after he arrived in America in 1812. Bolling invited Braidwood to stay in his home as Braidwood sorted out a more permanent living arrangement. Braidwood discussed with Bolling his desire to open a school similar to the Braidwood Academy in America. After many setbacks, the Cobbs School was established in 1815. It closed about a year and a half later, in the fall of 1816, when Braidwood's personal problems caused him to leave the school and Bolling could no longer financially maintain it.  Early manual education in the United States  A sculpture of Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet and Alice Cogswell located on the Gallaudet University campus In 1812 in New England, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet met a little girl named Alice Cogswell, who inspired him to create a school for the deaf in the United States. In 1815, he traveled to Europe to gain insight on their methods of teaching deaf students. He attempted to learn from the Braidwood system, but the administrators wanted him to sign a contract, remain at the school for several years to be trained in oralism, and agree to keep the teaching methods of the school a secret; Gallaudet refused this. He attended a lecture in France by Abbé Sicard showcasing two successful pupils of Paris' National Institution for Deaf-Mutes, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc. Gallaudet spent several months at the school, and he convinced Clerc, a thirty-year-old assistant teacher, to return with him to Hartford, Connecticut. Back in America, they established the Connecticut Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, which was later named the American School for the Deaf, in 1817. Gallaudet was the director, and Clerc was the first deaf teacher in America. Alice Cogswell was one of the first seven students. For most of the remainder of the century, education of deaf children using sign language, a practice known as manualism, continued to grow. Approximately forty percent of all teachers were deaf. More than thirty schools for the deaf were opened, the majority of which were manual. William Willard was the first deaf superintendent in America and founded Indiana School for the Deaf in 1843. Gallaudet College (now Gallaudet University) was founded in Washington, D.C in 1864 with Thomas Gallaudet's son, Edward Miner Gallaudet, as the school's superintendent. Edward Miner Gallaudet strongly believed in the use of sign language and had a number of arguments with Alexander Graham Bell, an oralist. Before the 1860s and before the American Civil War, manual language was very popular among the Deaf community and also supported by the hearing community. The hearing community viewed deafness as “[isolating] the individual from the Christian community”. At the time, the people of the United States were fairly religious (notably Christian), and the hearing-advantaged believed that sign language opened deaf individuals' minds and souls to God. Through this, the hearing community believed that manualism brought deaf people closer to God and opened deaf people to the Gospel, which brought manualism general acceptance. Prior to the 1860s, the American hearing community viewed manualism, sign language, as an art, and naturally beautiful. They also thought of deaf people who signed as being like the Romans because of the pantomimes that are a part of the language.  Change from predominantly manual education to oral education  By the end of the American Civil War in the late 1860s, the argument for “Survival of the Fittest” was applied to the issue of education for the deaf as a result of a Darwinist perspective of Evolution. This movement brought manualists arguing their view that signs were closer to nature because the first thing babies learn to do is gesture, which is akin to sign language. To the Deaf community, manualism was at the time considered a gift from God. During this particular time in the United States, oralism was coming about which gave some a negative view of manualism because, it was argued, it was not a natural language. Support for oralism gained momentum in the late 1860s and the use of manualism started to decrease. Many in the hearing community were now in favor of the evolutionary perspective, which depicted deaf people who used manual language akin to “lower animals”. Some hearing people viewed speech as what separated humans from animals, which in turn caused manual language to be viewed as unhumanlike. The first schools for oralism opened in the 1860s were called The New York Institution for the Improved Instruction of Deaf Mutes and The Clarke Institution for Deaf-Mutes (now the Clarke Schools for Hearing and Speech). At that time the teaching of manual language was restricted because the American Hearing Society saw deaf people who used it as different, as foreigners, or as a group with a separate language that was a threat to the hearing society. Members of the hearing community who were in favor of oralism took offense to deaf people having their own group identity and refusing to integrate within the greater community. Oralists believed that the manual language made deaf people different, which in turn led them to believe that deaf people were abnormal. Oralists believed that the teaching of oralism allowed deaf children to be more normal. Oralists strongly believed that deaf children should put as much effort as possible into learning how to live in spite of their disabilities, thus promoting the teaching of lip reading, mouth movements, and use of hearing technology. Oralists also argued that if deaf people continued the use of manual language as their form of communication, they would never integrate within the rest of society. It has been remarked that the better-funded northern schools switched to oralism while their poorer southern counterparts kept signing because it was difficult to hire new oralist teachers. Footnote 37 references Baynton Alexander Graham Bell with a group of deaf students from the Scott Circle School, 1883 A model figure for oralism and against the usage of sign language was Alexander Graham Bell, who created the Volta Bureau in Washington, D.C. to pursue the studies of deafness. Two other Americans who encouraged the founding of oralist schools in the United States were Horace Mann and Samuel Gridley Howe, who travelled to Germany to see their oral schools and who wished to model them. In 1880, an event called the Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf (which, despite the name, was actually the first) took place. The Second International Congress was an international meeting of deaf educators from at least seven countries. There were five delegates from America and around 164 delegates total in attendance. The Congress was planned and organized by a committee created by the Pereire Society, a group that was against sign language. More than half of the people invited were known oralists; therefore, the Congress was biased and most, if not all, of the resolutions that were voted on by the delegates gave results in favor of the oral method. Many of the resolutions were worded in ways that supported the oral method, such as \\"Considering the incontestable superiority of speech over signs in restoring the deaf-mute to society, and in giving him a more perfect knowledge of language,/Declares –/That the Oral method ought to be preferred that of signs for the education and instruction of the deaf and dumb\\". Until the 1890s, deaf education in the United States was limited to children as in the school of Sarah Warren Keeler, but Lillie Eginton Warren and her assistant, Edward B. Nichie, expanded the teaching to adults.  Early 20th century  After the Congress, deaf education in America changed. Manualists, those who advocated for sign language usage, were effectively \\"kicked out\\" and replaced with teachers who used the pure oral method. Deaf teachers were removed from the profession and replaced with hearing ones. Most schools switched to the oral method or were created as oral schools in the first place, and few manual schools remained in existence. The work of deaf educators in the oralist schools, who were mostly women, was to prepare the deaf children for life in the hearing world, which required them to learn English, speech, and lipreading. All students that were sent to the oral schools were forced to use the oral method, and oralist schools restricted the deaf students' use of American Sign Language (ASL) in class and in public. Students in pure oral programs were not allowed to sign in class and were also forbidden to sign in dormitories. Students caught signing were punished, but students continued to learn sign from each other anyway. One type of punishment used on deaf students was to force them to wear white gloves that were tied together to prevent them from using signs. Those who were not successful under the oral method after several years were transferred to manual classes and considered \\"oral failures\\" who would never know anything or be able to make it in the world. Some consider this the \\"Dark Age of Oralism\\". Edith Mansford Fitzgerald opposed these views, as a deaf woman who felt that the oralist methods had stunted her learning. In 1926, she published a book, entitled Straight Language for the Deaf: A System of Instruction for Deaf Children was published in 1926 and was widely influential in the field of deaf education. Her Fitzgerald Key at one point was used in around 75% of the institutes teaching the deaf.  Instructors  In the early 20th century there was an increase of instructors who were deaf in many schools for the deaf. In America one of the biggest debates the deaf community had with the institutions was whether to hire more instructors who were deaf instead of hearing. Part of the reason why parents of students who are deaf wanted instructors who were deaf was to allow their children to have a role model, by allowing more instructors who were deaf allowing their children to see a possible future for themselves through their instructors.  Late 20th century  The almost exclusive use of the pure oral method in deaf education continued well into the twentieth century. Then, during the late 1960s, Roy Kay Holcomb coined the term \\"Total Communication\\". This term described an educational philosophy he popularized where the child could use the communication method that worked best for them given their needs. If a child learned better with American Sign Language or an English sign system, they were taught using that method. If a different method worked better with another child, they received their instruction that way. Some schools using the oral method changed to Total Communication; others just added sign into their existing program or simply allowed children to sign amongst themselves without punishment. Often, the \\"sign languages\\" used in oral programs were constructed Manually Coded English (MCE) systems such as Seeing Essential English or Signing Exact English or were ASL signs in English word order. The programs used these systems in order to use them with speech in a practice known as Sign Supported Speech or Simultaneous Communication.  Deaf President Now  In 1988, Gallaudet University students decided that they would take matters of their education into their own hands. The sixth president of Gallaudet had announced in late 1987 that he would be resigning his position as president. By early 1988, the committee that selected the candidates had narrowed it down to three finalists, two of which, Dr. Harvey Corson and Dr. I. King Jordan, were deaf, and one of which, Dr. Elisabeth Zinser, was hearing. On March 6, it was announced hastily through press release (even though the selection committee was supposed to come on campus) that Zinser, the only hearing candidate, had become the seventh president of the university. There had been rallies beforehand for a deaf president (most notably on March 1), but on the 6th, the rallying changed into protest. Students and faculty went on marches, made signs, and gave demonstrations. The students locked the gates to the university and refused let the school open until Zinser resigned. Under intense pressure from the students protesting, Zinser resigned on the fifth day of the protest, March 10. Many students decided to stay on campus instead of going on Spring Break, which was scheduled to begin on March 11. Two days later, on March 13 Jane Spilman resigned and was replaced by Phil Bravin as chair of the Board of Trustees, a taskforce was created to figure out how to achieve a 51% majority of deaf people on the Board of Trustees, and no one received any punishment for being in the protest. I. King Jordan was named eighth president—and first deaf president—of Gallaudet University. Deaf President Now changed deaf education. Before the protest, a select few deaf people held doctorates; however, since the protest, the number of deaf people pursuing and earning advanced degrees has steadily increased. Also, schools for the deaf across America have had “mini DPNs” where students demanded deaf superintendents and senior administrators. In addition, collegiate programs were created in other countries that did not previously have them (such as Japan, Sweden, and South Africa). Deaf President Now not only affected deaf education in America, but it also affected deaf education worldwide. In 1990, cochlear implants were approved for children two years of age and up. This drastically changed education for deaf children. More children than ever were migrated out of bilingual-bicultural residential schools and into oral schools and mainstream programs with no extra supports. Parents were not encouraged to sign with their children because it was feared that it would slow down their speech, even though research has shown that the opposite is true. This move from residential schools to day schools and mainstreaming has caused many residential programs to downsize.  Instructors  In the most recent years the deaf community has been fighting hard for more instructors who are deaf in the public school system. In 1991 Carlsbad Unified School District parents went to the school board to complain about the lack of any instructors who are deaf. Many parents stated that their children are not getting the best education they could be getting because of the lack of representation of instructors who are deaf. However, the department head of the deaf education program says his instructors are trained for deaf and hard of hearing students. Many parents felt that having the background of understanding of deaf education is vastly different from being a person who is deaf.  Today  Today, there are a few different methods used in the education of deaf children in the United States. All deaf students, regardless of placement, receive an Individualized Education Program (IEP) that outlines how the school will meet the student's individual needs. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires that students with special needs be provided with a Free Appropriate Public Education in the Least Restrictive Environment that is appropriate to the student's needs. Government-run schools provide deaf education in varying degrees of settings ranging from full inclusion to schools for the deaf.  Bilingual-bicultural education  The Alumni Hall, the middle and high school at Indiana School for the Deaf, a bilingual- bicultural school In this educational method, deafness is not seen as a medical issue; it is instead seen as a cultural issue. In the bilingual- bicultural program, it is advocated that children who are deaf be taught ASL as a first language, then be taught written and/or spoken English as a second language. Bilingual-bicultural programs emphasize that English and ASL are equal languages, and they work to help children develop age-appropriate levels of fluency in both languages. The bilingual-bicultural approach holds the belief that deaf children are visual learners as opposed to auditory learners, and therefore, academic content should be fully accessible to all deaf students (i.e. not contingent on spoken receptive/expressive skills, which may vary across students), so academic content is delivered in ASL and/or written English. Since it is not possible to simultaneously produce grammatically correct, fluent American Sign Language and spoken English, only one language is used at a time. Because there is no risk in learning sign language, the bilingual-bicultural approach mitigates the risk of language deprivation (a condition that arises when children have limited access to both spoken and sign language). Many bilingual-bicultural schools have dormitories, and deaf children can either commute to the school daily or stay in a dormitory as part of the residential program and visit their families on weekends and/or holidays and school vacations. Residential programs A residential program is an educational program in which a student lives at a school for the deaf during the week and goes home on weekends or holidays instead of commuting to the school daily. In residential programs, deaf children are fully immersed in Deaf culture. At a residential school, all students are deaf or hard of hearing, so deaf students are not looked at as different. They have \\"a common heritage,… a common language,… and a set of customs and values\\". People at deaf schools help pass on \\"Deaf folklore and folklife (jokes, legends, games, riddles, etc.)\\" from one generation to the next. Deaf parents of deaf children often send their children to residential schools so that they may participate in the Deaf community and culture. Hearing parents are often a bit more reluctant because they do not want to be separated from their children. The first deaf woman to hold the position of superintendent of a residential school for the deaf in the U.S. was Gertrude Scott Galloway.  Auditory-oral and auditory-verbal education  Northampton campus of Clarke Schools for Hearing and Speech, an oral school. The auditory-oral and auditory-verbal methods, sometimes referred to collectively as listening and spoken language, are forms of oral education. These methods are based on the belief that a deaf child can learn to listen and speak and that families do not need to learn sign language or cued speech. These methods are presented as communication options, and they rely on a large amount of parental involvement. Children who use this option may be placed in a continuum of educational placements including oral schools, such as Clarke Schools for Hearing and Speech, self-contained classrooms for deaf students in public schools, or mainstream classrooms with hearing students. Though some deaf children can learn to use hearing devices to speak and understand language, that is not the case for all deaf children. Therefore, auditory-oral only education puts children at risk of language deprivation: a condition that arises when children have limited access to both spoken and sign language. Unlike children who receive auditory-oral-only education, deaf children who use both signed and spoken language speak as well as their hearing counterparts.  Mainstreaming and inclusion  Two interpreters working for a school This educational method is what occurs when a deaf child attends public school in regular classes for at least part of the school day. Students may receive accommodations such as itinerant teachers, interpreters, assistive technology, notetakers, and aides. Inclusion can have benefits including daily interaction with hearing students and the opportunity to live at home, but it can also have drawbacks such as isolation and limited availability of support.

It was formed in June 1943 using a brigade from the Home Guard of the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH) with the addition of a German cadre. The division was commanded by Germans down to battalion and even company level in nearly all cases, and was commonly referred to as a \\"legionnaire division\\". Originally formed with the intention of service on the Eastern Front, it was used instead for anti-Partisan operations in the territory of the NDH until the end of the war. It fought mainly in the western areas of the NDH, and was involved in the attempt to kill or capture the leader of the Partisans, Josip Broz Tito, in May 1944. Severely depleted by desertion, the division withdrew towards the Reich border in the early months of 1945, eventually surrendering to the Partisans on 10 May 1945 near Brežice in modern-day Slovenia. History Formation After the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Ante Pavelić, the leader of the newly created Axis puppet state the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), offered Adolf Hitler volunteers to serve on the Eastern Front. This offer soon resulted in the formation and deployment of army, air force and naval detachments which, after being trained and equipped by Germany, were committed to fighting the Red Army. The largest element was the 369th Croatian Reinforced Infantry Regiment, which was part of the 100th Jäger Division, but was decimated at Stalingrad in January 1943. The Croatian forces performed creditably on the Eastern Front, and the Germans continued to support the development of NDH forces with the aim of raising several divisions to serve there. Due to the lack of trained leaders and staff, these divisions were raised using a German cadre. The 373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division was assembled and trained in Stockerau and Döllersheim, Austria, commencing from the end of January 1943 as the second Croatian division raised for service in the Wehrmacht, following its sister formation, the 369th (Croatian) Infantry Division. It was built around a cadre of 3,500 German troops, and 8,500 soldiers of the 7th Mountain Brigade of the Croatian Home Guard, the regular army of the NDH. It was established with two infantry regiments of three battalions each. Each regiment was allocated the manpower from two of the four battalions of the 7th Mountain Brigade. It was formed under the command of Generalmajor (Brigadier) Emil Zellner, with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipient Oberst (Colonel) Alois Windisch commanding the 383rd (Croatian) Grenadier Regiment and Oberst Boicetta commanding the 384th (Croatian) Grenadier Regiment. All battalions were commanded by Germans except for the reconnaissance battalion, which was commanded by a Croat officer, Major Bakarec. The Croatian divisions that served in the Wehrmacht were commonly known as \\"legionnaire divisions\\". Although originally intended for use on the Eastern Front, the division did not deploy there and returned to the NDH in May 1943 due to the need to combat the communist-led Partisans in the territory of the NDH. The division left its training area in Austria over the period 1–12 May 1943, travelling by train via the route Vienna–Graz–Marburg–Zagreb. It was known as the \\"Tiger Division\\" (), and was subordinated to the Croatia Command () of General der Infanterie (Lieutenant General) Rudolf Lüters. 1943 Initial tasks The first task of the division was to secure the area north and northwest of Mostar, which contained important bauxite reserves needed for the German war effort. The divisional headquarters was established in Bugojno with the regimental headquarters of the 383rd at Lise, and the 384th at Travnik. At the end of May, one battalion (III/383) and supporting artillery were deployed to Mostar to replace Italian forces. For the first few weeks the division had only minor contacts with Partisan forces, but by mid-June the division began sending out strong Jagdkommandos, lightly armed and mobile \\"hunter teams\\" of company or battalion strength, to break up and harass Partisans operating in the divisional area of responsibility. In early July, a search and destroy operation was conducted west of the Kupres–Bugojno–Jajce road, during which local Chetnik units began cooperating with the division. On 5 July, Bakarec summoned the inhabitants of a village and shot six captured Partisans in front of them. The division lost 23 killed during this operation. Following the conclusion of this sweep, the division moved north, and its headquarters redeployed to Prijedor. Throughout July and August 1943 the division patrolled constantly and fought minor engagements in its area of responsibility. On 5 August 1943, Generalleutnant (Major General) Eduard Aldrian became divisional commander replacing Zellner, who was transferred to the Army Headquarters officers' reserve pool (). On 16 August, Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel) Mück replaced Windisch as commander of the 383rd Regiment, and the division was placed under the command of the 2nd Panzer Army, which had been redeployed to the Balkans from the Eastern Front. Over the period 18–22 August, 102 Croat and Bosnian Muslim soldiers deserted, ten of whom were later arrested. There were a range of factors encouraging desertion, including Partisan propaganda and infiltration, the influence of the Croatian Peasant Party, and reverses suffered by the Germans in North Africa and at Stalingrad and elsewhere on the Eastern Front. Combat intensifies In late August and early September 1943, the division redeployed again, this time to Bihać, relieving the 114th Jäger Division which redeployed to the Adriatic coast. The move was difficult, with several significant ambushes resulting in numerous casualties and the loss of several vehicles and guns. In September, it was placed under the command of the newly formed XV Mountain Corps led by Lüters. That month, the division concluded a collaboration agreement with the 260-strong Chetnik detachment of Mane Rokvić, who was in control of an area which included parts of both western Bosnia and Lika. The division utilised the Chetniks to protect railway lines and key industries in their area, as well as for scouting against the Partisans and attacks on the rear of Partisan formations. Desertions worsened particularly after the capitulation of Italy in early September 1943. For example, during October 1943, 334 men deserted from the division. It handled thousands of Italian prisoners in the aftermath of the surrender, feeding them and marching them under guard towards the Reich. On 20 October 1943, the Germans formally confirmed that the division would not be utilised outside the NDH. In the second half of October 1943, Partisan forces surrounded the Croatian Home Guard garrison of Prijedor. The 383rd Regiment relieved the garrison and conducted clearing operations around the town until heavy snowfalls in the first week in November. On 4 December, Oberstleutnant Hühnewaldt replaced Mück as the commander of that regiment. Operations Panther and Ristow Between 10 and 24 December 1943, the division, along with the 371st Infantry Division and the 1st Cossack Division, participated in Operation Panther. The aim of the operation was to encircle Partisan forces located within the Kostajnica forest and the area north of Bosanski Novi. The operation achieved little, and was immediately followed by Operation Ristow. The objective of this operation was to clear the area south of the Sana river between Bosanski Novi and Prijedor, and destroy elements of the Partisan 7th Banija Division, which intelligence indicated were planning to establish winter quarters in the vicinity of Maslovare village, with the river Japra protecting their rear. The division committed the 383rd Infantry Regiment, reinforced by three tanks of the 202nd Panzer Battalion, and supported by the guns of I. Battalion, 373rd Artillery Regiment. The plan involved a three-day operation commencing on 24 December. Following up reconnaissance by the Croatian 3rd Mountain Brigade, the objective of the first day was to thrust eastward from Bosanski Novi to secure heights east of the Japra, and this was achieved against light resistance. The following day saw heavy fighting before the German force secured their objectives, suffering ten wounded in the process. After mopping up on 26 December, orders were issued for I. Battalion to continue the advance south of the Sana towards the village of Trgovište, while II. Battalion was ordered to cross the Sana on rafts and continue the advance on the northern side of the river. On the morning of 27 December, I. Battalion successfully advanced to a point about west of Prijedor, and occupied Trgovište. Advancing further east, I. Battalion lost formation and suffered heavy attacks from Partisan forces who also infiltrated between the companies and attacked their flanks and rear. The entire force, less two companies and the tanks which remained north of the river, consolidated on heights south of the Sana, and throughout the night fought off several large Partisan assaults which were supported by heavy mortar fire. On 28 December, the German force fought its way to the south bank of the Sana, and evacuated its casualties across the river on rafts. The main body then fought its way east to Prijedor with covering fire provided by the two companies and tanks remaining on the northern bank, with the majority arriving on 29 December. Operation Ristow was very costly for the division, with I. Battalion alone suffering 100 casualties, mainly from mortar fire on the night of 27/28 December. Information from the local population indicated that the Partisans lost at least 76 dead during the operation. 1944 Battle of Banja Luka In late December 1943, Hühnewaldt was tasked with the defence of Banja Luka, the second largest city in Bosnia, which had been under Partisan pressure for several days. The headquarters of XV Mountain Corps was in Banja Luka, along with the divisional replacement battalion, divisional support troops, some police and a few tanks. Elements of the 4th Jäger Brigade of the Croatian Home Guard were also in the city. On 31 December, Hühnewaldt deployed I/383 to Banja Luka to further bolster the defences. At 23:00 that day, a heavy artillery and mortar bombardment started, followed by a Partisan attack that quickly overran the Home Guard outposts and engaged the divisional units in heavy fighting. At first light on New Year's Day, I/383 counterattacked, recapturing the crucial power station. That evening the Partisans renewed their assault, overrunning the hospital and massacring the German sick and wounded, and capturing the railway station. By this point the defenders were concentrated in two blocks of the town centre and the Partisans were only away. A desperate but unsuccessful counterattack was mounted, and the city appeared lost when the force was relieved by the 901st Panzergrenadier Lehr Regiment. The Partisans quickly withdrew and the Ustaše Militia and Sicherheitsdienst (Security Police) subsequently executed all armed personnel captured in the city. Those killed during the battle included 67 Germans, 150 Croatian Home Guard and between 300 and 350 Partisans. Following the battle, the division cleared and secured the area around Banja Luka, and in February 1944 Hühnewaldt was replaced as commander of the 383rd Regiment by Major Ristow of I/383. At the end of March, most of the 383rd Regiment was deployed to Knin with responsibility for the road between Knin and Bihać, with the regimental commander designated as the commander of the garrison. In the latter task, it was assisted by the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen. From 7 to 16 May 1944, the division participated in Operation Morgenstern (Morning Star) in the Krbavsko Polje region west and southwest of Bihać, along with elements of its sister formation, the 392nd (Croatian) Infantry Division, the 92nd Motorised Regiment, the 1st Jäger Regiment of the Panzergrenadier Division Brandenburg, and Ustase units. The operation was a significant success, killing 438 Partisans and capturing 56, along with large quantities of arms, ammunition, vehicles and supplies. Operation Rösselsprung The division formed a significant part of the ground force used by XV Mountain Corps in Operation Rösselsprung, which was launched on 25 May 1944, with the objectives of killing or capturing the Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito, and destroying his headquarters at Drvar. The division was responsible for two of the nine coordinated thrusts converging on the Partisan stronghold in the Drvar-Bosanski Petrovac area. The first thrust consisted of the 384th (Croatian) Infantry Regiment, referred to as Kampfgruppe Willam after its commander. The 384th Regiment group was to advance east at 5 am on 25 May from the village of Srb towards Drvar. Kampfgruppe Willam had the primary responsibility for relieving then taking command of 500th SS Parachute Battalion who would land by parachute and glider in Drvar on 25 May, and the regiment was then to attack in the direction of Bosanski Petrovac. The second thrust consisted of a battalion group from the division, which was to set out at 5 am on 25 May from Lapac and drive east through Kulen Vakuf to capture the crossroads at Vrtoče. If necessary, they were then to advance north-west towards Bihać to open the road. Throughout 25 May, the ground forces of XV Mountain Corps were not able to advance as quickly as expected. There was unexpected resistance from strong Partisan forces along their axes of advance, and there was very poor communication between the various elements which resulted in lack of coordination of their movements. They were also subjected to several Allied air attacks. In the meantime, Tito and his key staff escaped to the south and were flown to Italy. Kampfgruppe Willam was unable to overcome the resistance of the 2nd Lika Brigade, and to force its way through to Drvar until the paratroopers had been relieved around midday on 26 May by a stronger column attacking from the direction of Bihać. On 29 May the battalion group from the division attacked strong Partisan positions east, north and northwest of Prekaja, but the attack was held up by a lack of ammunition. The attack was renewed on 31 May after new orders had been issued, with the division occupying the Prekaja area and capturing two Partisan tanks. Operation Rösselsprung was a failure as Tito and his principal headquarters staff escaped. Final months In the autumn of 1944, the division absorbed the 2nd Jäger Brigade of the Croatian Home Guard as its third regiment, renamed the 385th (Croatian) Infantry Regiment. On 20 October, Oberst der Reserves Karl Hermann replaced Aldrian, and was in turn replaced by Oberst Hans Gravenstein on 14 November. On 6 December 1944, the division participated in the defence of Knin against the Partisans, where it suffered serious losses. In January 1945, Gravenstein was promoted to Generalmajor, and withdrew the survivors of the division to the northwest towards Bihać. During this withdrawal, the division assisted the 6,000–7,000 Chetniks of Momčilo Đujić that had fought alongside them at Knin and accompanied them towards Bihać. Later that month, a large number of Croats from the division deserted to join the Partisans during the attack of the 35th Lika Division. This trend continued, with a further two companies of Croat soldiers deserting. The division saw action against the Partisans until the end of the war. However, by April 1945 a large part of its Croatian manpower had been lost or released, with the Croatian elements only numbering between 2,000 and 3,000 soldiers. During the last few months of the war, it fought in northern Dalmatia and parts of Lika and Kordun during Lika-Primorje operation and later in Banija. When the Partisans launched their spring offensive on 20 March 1945, it fought the Partisan 2nd Army as it advanced on Zagreb. The division withdrew from Gospić via Donji Lapac, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi and Kostajnica where most of its remaining Croatian soldiers were separated out from the German elements and probably dispersed. The remainder continued its withdrawal via Sunja, Sisak and Zagreb to Brežice in modern-day Slovenia, where it surrendered to the Partisans at the village of Raka on 10 May 1945, and the remaining Croat soldiers left the division. The division's disarmed German troops were allowed to travel towards Germany for several days before becoming prisoners of war of the Partisans. Gravenstein was tried by the Yugoslav authorities in 1947 and hanged. Organisational history The initial composition of the division was: * 383rd (Croatian) Grenadier Regiment (I, II, III battalions) * 384th (Croatian) Grenadier Regiment (I, II, III battalions) * 373rd Artillery Regiment (I, II, III battalions) * 373rd Fusilier Battalion * 373rd Reconnaissance Battalion * 373rd Pioneer Battalion * 373rd Signals Battalion * 373rd Division Support Units In autumn 1944 the division absorbed the 2nd Jäger Brigade of the Croatian Home Guard, which created a third infantry regiment, the 385th (Croatian) Grenadier Regiment.

Though claimed as a clone of the American town, the resort is not an exact replica. The architectural style and artifacts contained though could conceivably be from the original town. Jackson Hole, China is a resort town on the border between Huailai County, Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province, China, and Yanqing District, Beijing, wedged between Taihang and Yan mountain ranges. Its translated Chinese name is \\"Hometown, U.S.A\\" () according to another article, which says that resort towns in the countryside of China are rare and are usually associated with being \\"agrarian.\\" The locale contains spacious backyards that make the location feel like one from America away from the hustle and bustle of Chinese city life. History The town's inspiration comes from Allison Smith who came up with the idea to replicate the architecture found in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in the United States of America. According to KIRO-TV, \\"you can find a Jackson Hole in China\\". The intent of Jackson Hole, China, according to this article is to design the area to be Americanized. In the 1000 single-home housing development, the theme included designs reminiscent of \\"Billy the Kid, Geronimo, Stagecoach Station, Betsy (the play), Big Bear, etc.\\". Smith had researched various resort locations including Martha's Vineyard; Vail, Colorado and then eventually Jackson Hole and chose the latter for the design and theme of the resort town. In Smith's research she \\"gathered cowhide, antler chandeliers, saddle blankets, lodge pole chairs, wagon wheels, Navajo rugs, iron light fixtures, wildlife scene fireplace screens, wooden snowshoes, leather throw pillows, horseshoes, Charles Russell prints and plaid curtains, shipping them all to China.\\" Liu Xiangyang who is the Developer of the Community, says his selling point is more than architecture; his buyers want freedom and spirituality, so he has built a Christian church in the center of the community for residents. While the resort community's reception varies widely, its striking resemblance to its namesake Western town has raised concerns in academic circles over the possibility of American neocolonialism. In August 2018, Dr. Jåcobs pointed to the Chinese town as evidence that the most pernicious forms of governmental and societal control exist in the actions of capitalistic expatriates. Property values According to Smith, the properties \\"... have sold out and nearly tripled in value since being built.\\" As the first model was put up in a Beijing park for display, \\"... people apparently went nuts for it.\\" See also *Europe Street *Hallstatt (China) *Thames Town *Ju Jun – known as \\"Orange County, China\\" External links Category:Geography of Hebei Category:Tourism in China Category:Tourist attractions in Hebei Category:Replica constructions in China Category:Huailai County ","title":"Jackson Hole, China"},{"id":"34322582","text":"James Henry Bonella (17 December 1884 – 24 May 1918) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL), under the name of Jim Bonelli.

Shorinjiryu Koshinkai Karatedo is the school of karate taught by the Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo Association, the original Australian school of Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan Karate, founded in 1977.http://www.shorinjiryu.com.au/shorinjiryu-australia/  History of Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo  Shorinjiryu Koshinkai Karatedo is the school of karate practiced by the members of the Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo Association Inc. Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo has a history dating back to 1977, when it was founded by Laurence Vanniekirk (aka Lori Vann). Vanniekirk had immigrated to Brisbane, Australia with his family from South Africa in 1970. His previous background was in judo and the Shitō-ryū karate, having set up the South African branch of Tani Ha Shito-Ryu Shuko-Kai. After having sustained a shoulder injury in judo, Vanniekirk took up karate in 1959, initially studying from books, before visiting Japan in 1964. During his time in Japan, he was graded to 3rd Dan by Chōjirō Tani, founder of Shukokai.Overton, G 1989, 'Instructors Profile: Sensei Laurence Van Niekirk', Australasian Fighting Arts, Vol 12 No. 2, pp 21–23 After immigrating to Australia, Vanniekirk founded the Australian branch of the same organisation. He subsequently established the Australian branch of an offshoot of Shukokai, Renbukan. After leaving the Renbukan, Laurence Vanniekirk and a group of his students trained independently. Vanniekirk was given a copy of the book Scientific Karatedo by Masayuki Hisataka, and after reading it, he made contact with the author and subsequently visited Japan to train in Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan Karate with both Kōri Hisataka and Masayuki Hisataka. On returning to Australia in 1977, Laurence Vanniekirk established the Australian branch of Shorinjiryu Kenkokan Karatedo, and in so doing set up the Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo Association.Overton, G 1989, \\"Instructors Profile: Sensei Laurence Van Niekirk\\", Australasian Fighting Arts, Vol 12 No. 2, pp. 21–23 During the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo grew strongly, with many dojo established in Queensland (mainly around Brisbane), and New South Wales. The NSW group started in the Coonabarabran and Coolah area, having been started by local karateka Scott Brown and Graeme Bowden, who had travelled to Brisbane to train for an extended period with Laurence Vanniekirk. The NSW dojo expanded to include other country centres including Gunnedah and Tamworth, as well as the Sydney metropolitan area. Scott Brown also spent an extended period of timing training in Japan, directly studying under international head master, Masayuki Hisataka.Nowland, D 1991, \\"Instructors Profile: Sensei Scott Brown\\", Australasian Fighting Arts, Vol 14 No 6, pp. 26–29 In 1985, Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo (under Vanniekirk's leadership) hosted the 5th International Koshiki Karatedo Championships, in Brisbane. At that event, Masayuki Hisataka promoted Laurence Vanniekirk to 6th Dan in Shorinjiryu Kenkokan Karatedo. In the late 1980s, Vanniekirk retired as Chief Instructor, passing the reins jointly to the two senior instructors, Phillip Hooper (Queensland) and Scott Brown (NSW). Phillip Hooper was a long time student of Vanniekirk, while Brown had studied extensively under Vanniekirk, but was also a direct student of Masayuki Hisataka, having spent a significant period of time in Japan at the Shorinjiryu Kenkokan Karatedo so-hombu dojo. At the time, both were graded to 5th Dan in Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan Karatedo. In 1994, Scott Brown stepped aside, and Phillip Hooper became sole chief instructor. He was graded to 6th Dan in by Masayuki Hisataka at the World Koshiki Karate Championships in Japan during that year. In 1995, Phil Hooper lead Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo Association in separating from the Shorinjiryu Kenkokan organisation, thus becoming an independent school of Shōrinjiryū Karatedo. At this time, the school was simply known as Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo. Phillip Hooper retired as chief instructor in 2000, passing the reigns, jointly, to Jim Griffin (Queensland) and Max Estens (NSW). Griffin was a student of Phillip Hooper, whilst Estens was a student of both Scott Brown and Phillip Hooper. Both had also studied under Masayuki Hisataka in Japan and Australia. As of 2012, Jim Griffin and Max Estens continue to jointly lead Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo. Seeking to establish ties with the international community of practitioners of the Shorinjiryu Karatedo style of Kōri Hisataka (the founder of Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan Karate), in 2001 Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo became a member of the International Shorinjiryu Shinzen Kyokai, an umbrella organisation of various independent schools based on the same foundation. Contingents from Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo have competed in that organisations international tournament, held annually in New York, in 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2011. In conjunction with the 2006 trip, led by Jim Griffin, Max Estens and Des Paroz, the Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo contingent spent a week in Baltimore, training at the dojo of Shunji Watanabe, a direct student of the founder of Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan Karatedo, Kōri Hisataka.http://www.shishikai.com/shorinjiryu_australia.htm Shunji Watanabe was very forthcoming in sharing the karate taught to him by his teacher, giving the contingent a glimpse into the old style Shōrinjiryū Karate originally taught. Along with two of his senior instructors, Shunji Watanabe visited Australia in 2007. At that time, he invited the Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo Association organisation to become members of his organisation, the Shorinjiryu Kenyukai Watanabe-Ha Federation, and to become his students. So in 2007, the school of karate taught by the Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo Association became Shorinjiryu Kenyukai Watanabe-Ha Karate. Although the karate taught by both Masayuki Hisataka and Shunji Watanabe was each based on the Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan Karatedo of Kōri Hisataka, there were some significant differences, with Watanabe's karate relatively unchanged from that taught to him, while Hisataka's had evolved, particularly based on Hisataka's foundation of the Koshiki Karate competition system, utilising Supersafe Anzen Bogu protective equipment. In this way, the Australian organisation has the unique position of having learned two distinct interpretations of Shōrinjiryū, directly from the founder's two senior-most students. In 2011, the members of the Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo Association again elected to become an independent school of Shorinjiryu Karatedo. Jim Griffin and Max Estens, together with senior instructors Lesley Griffin, Des Paroz and Tony Fletcher, founded a new school of Shorinjiryu, which has been named Shorinjiryu Koshinkai Karatedo.Clarke, M., \\"Karate With a Twist\\", Blitz Australasian Martial Arts, Vol 25 No 9 (Sept 2011), pp. 32–36 Koshinkai means the group of the old and new, and represents the bringing together of the various teachings of Shorinjiryu they have been exposed to from Masayuki Hisataka, Shunji Watanabe, Laurence Vanniekirk and others. The name was chosen to reflect each of these influences, and also reflects the spirit of the Japanese koto waza known as \\"On Ko Chi Shin\\", which reminds us that by studying the old, we better understand the new. As of 2012, Shorinjiryu Koshinkai Karatedo, the school of karatedo taught by the Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo Association has seven active dojo, including Bribie Island, Brisbane (Coorparoo), Murgon and Rockhampton in Queensland, Coonabarabran and Sydney (Hunters Hill) in NSW, and Melbourne (Altona and Point Cook) in Victoria.  Grading structure  Like many schools based on Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan Karate, Shorinjiryu Koshinkai Karatedo utilises a belt system, with 10 coloured belt levels (kyu) for non- black holders (mudansha) and 10 levels (dan) for black belt holders (yudansha). The 10 levels of coloured belts used in Shorinjiryu Koshinkai Karatedo are: * 10th kyu – White belt * 9th kyu – White belt with yellow tips * 8th kyu – Yellow belt * 7th kyu – Yellow belt with orange tips * 6th kyu – Orange belt * 5th kyu – Orange belt with green tips * 4th kyu – Green belt * 3rd kyu – Green belt with brown tips * 2nd kyu – Brown belt * 1st kyu – Brown belt with black tips Black belt holders (yudansha) all wear a black belt that may be embroidered with the holder's name and style. There are ceremonial belts for high-ranking black belts, including the red-and-black panelled belt for 5th Dan, the red-and-white panelled belt for holders of 6th, 7th and 8th Dan, and a red belt for 9th and 10th Dan masters. Joint Chief Instructor Jim Griffin is currently the highest-graded proponent of the Shorinjiryu Koshinkai organisation, holding the rank of 7th Dan and the title of Kyoshi. Joint Chief Instructor Max Estens is also graded 7th Dan and holds the title of Shihan. Senior Advisory Council members Des Paroz and Lesley Griffin are graded 6th Dan and hold the title of Shihan.http://www.shorinjiryu.com.au/dan-grade- register/ Kata The range of kata practiced in Shorinjiryu Koshinkai Karatedo include forms passed down from Masayuki Hisataka of Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan Karate and Shunji Watanabe of Shorinjiryu Kenyukai Watanabe Ha Karate.

Anderson, set in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. It is the first book in their Great Schools of Dune prequel trilogy, which itself is a sequel to their Legends of Dune trilogy. The book is set eighty years after the events of 2004's Dune: The Battle of Corrin, in which the human military finally defeat the thinking machine armies of Omnius. Now, the fledgling Bene Gesserit, Mentat and Suk Schools, as well as the Spacing Guild, are threatened by the independent anti-technology forces gaining power in the aftermath of the Butlerian Jihad. The Great Schools of Dune trilogy, first mentioned by Anderson in a 2010 blog post, will chronicle the early years of these organizations, which figure prominently in the original Dune novels. Plot By the time of the novel, the Butler family, under the name Corrino, has consolidated a tenuous hold on the human-occupied universe. The head of the Corrino family, Emperor Salvador, lives in splendor on the planet Salusa Secundus with his brother and trusted advisor, Roderick, but their control of the Imperium is threatened by Manford Torondo, popular leader of the anti- technology Butlerian movement. The demagogue Torondo, deprived of both legs in a bomb blast decades previously, leads Swordmaster Anari Idaho and millions of people across the Imperium to cleanse humanity of its reliance on convenient technologies, often exploiting religious paranoia to advance his agendas. In opposition to the popular movement is the unscrupulous businessman Josef Venport, who holds a near-monopoly on space travel. Advised by his wife Cioba and great-grandmother Norma Cenva, who discovered the secret to creating space-folding \\"Navigators\\", Josef plots against his few remaining competitors and funds a secret group of scientific researchers who hold personal grudges against the Butlerians and are willing to salvage and optimize old cymek technology to satisfy their vendettas with Torondo. Meanwhile, on the planet Kepler, war hero Vorian Atreides attempts to keep his neighbors free from the threat of slavers. An attempt to obtain Imperial protection for his planet is successful, but Vorian is sent even deeper into exile by Salvador and Roderick, who are concerned that the Jihad hero may, through his celebrity, incite a rebellion against their authority. On the planet Lankiveil, the Harkonnen family ekes out a lean existence, far from the glory enjoyed by their ancestors after Vorian Atreides disowned the disgraced Abulurd Harkonnen. While the parents have decided to surrender ambition for survival and a humble existence, the two oldest children, Griffin and Valya, seek to rebuild their family fortunes through service to the Landsraad and the Sisterhood on Rossak, respectively. Vorian's granddaughter Raquella Berto- Anirul, who survived a poisoning that provided her with the memories and mental presences of her female ancestors, leads the Sisterhood. She thwarts Butlerian sympathizers within her own ranks, who correctly suspect that Raquella and her inner circle are using computers to manage their breeding index, which comprises an immense amount of family data from across the Imperium. Raquella is aided in these efforts by Sister Valya Harkonnen, who finds her efforts to rebuild her family's glory impeded when the spoiled Princess Anna Corrino (sister to Emperor Salvador and Roderick) is sent to Rossak. Anna, viewed as an embarrassment by the royal family, is meant to learn important skills with the Sisters, but instead follows her own childish ambitions and takes a drug designed to induce the near-death transformation that gave Raquella her abilities. Through the new director of the Suk Institute (and former Rossak Sister) Dr. Ori Zhoma, the Sisterhood also plots against Salvador, who it fears may be the ancestor of a potentially disastrous tyrant. The Mentat Gilbertus Albans attempts to maintain order in his Mentat school on the planet Lampadas and hide the existence of his old mentor, the robot Erasmus. However, Gilbertus is dragged into the Butlerian movement's anti-technology campaign by the fanaticism of his most vocal students, and the furor of Torondo, who coerces Gilbertus to serve as his special advisor. Gilbertus finds himself forced into a confrontation with his best student and friend, Draigo, who is in the service of Josef Venport's VenHold shipping conglomerate. Meanwhile, on the planet Arrakis, the Free Men of Dune, who have abandoned the easier life of the Arrakeen villages, continue to thrive in the desert, encountering various enemies and allies during the course of their existence. Reception Sisterhood of Dune debuted at #23 on The New York Times Hardcover Fiction Best-Seller List. Publishers Weekly called it a \\"shallow but fun blend of space opera and dynastic soap opera.\\" Library Journal noted the novel's \\"fully realized characters and intricate plotting\\".

For this project, only the upper reservoir had to be created as an existing reservoir, the Bailianhe Reservoir, was used as the lower. During periods of low energy demand, such as at night, water is pumped from Bailianhe Reservoir up to the upper reservoir. When energy demand is high, the water is released back down to the lower reservoir but the pump turbines that pumped the water up now reverse mode and serve as generators to produce electricity. The process is repeated as necessary and the plant serves as a peaking power plant. The Bailianhe Upper Reservoir was created with the construction of a tall concrete-face rock-fill dam. It has a crest length of and can storage up to of which can be used for power generation. The lower Bailianhe Reservoir was constructed on the Lotus River in the 1960s by an embankment dam as part of an irrigation plan for the region and to supply water for a small run-the-river power plant still in operation.

He is known for his investigations on the pharmacological properties and effects of quinine. He studied at the Universities of Würzburg and Bonn, later working at the University of Berlin in the pathological institute of Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902) and at the clinic of Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs (1819–1885). In 1868 he became an associate professor at Bonn, and several years later founded its pharmacological institute (1873). In 1885/86 he was university rector. During the Austro- Prussian War (1866) and Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) he served as a staff physician. In 1867 he discovered that quinine was highly toxic to micro- organisms in impure water, and demonstrated that quinine hydrochlorate with neutral or slightly basic reaction was an effective poison for the protoplasms of decomposing plants and impeded many fermenting and putrid processes. In addition to his research of quinine, he performed extensive pharmacological tests on arsenic, halogens and associated compounds, sleep-inducing substances, et al.

He was a discoverer of cosmic ray heavy nuclei and of solar proton events. He pioneered the use of high altitude balloons for scientific investigations and helped to develop procedures and equipment that underlie modern scientific ballooning. He was one of the first researchers to put experiments aboard spacecraft. In 1963, Ney became one of the first infrared astronomers. He founded O'Brien Observatory, where he and his colleagues discovered that certain stars are surrounded by grains of carbon and silicate minerals and established that these grains, from which planets are formed, are ubiquitous in circumstellar winds and regions of star formation.  Early life Ney's father, Otto Fred Ney and mother, Jessamine Purdy Ney, lived in Waukon, Iowa. However, in October 1920, his mother went to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Ney was delivered by Caesarean section. After elementary school, he attended Waukon High School, where he developed an interest in science and mathematics that was encouraged by Coach Howard B. Moffitt, who taught several of his courses and later became an administrator at the University of Iowa.  Career  In 1938, Ney began undergraduate studies at the University of Minnesota, where he became acquainted with Professor Alfred O. C. Nier, who was an expert in mass spectrometry. Soon, Nier recruited him to work in the spectroscopy laboratory for 35 cents per hour. In February 1940, Nier prepared a tiny but pure sample of Uranium-235, which he mailed to Columbia University, where John R. Dunning and his team proved that this isotope was responsible for nuclear fission, rather than the more abundant Uranium-238. This finding was a crucial step in the development of the atomic bomb. That summer, Ney and Robert Thompson prepared a larger sample of Uranium-235, which provided material for further important tests. Later, he helped Nier design and test mass spectrographs that were replicated for extensive use in the Manhattan Project. Graduate studies in Virginia In June 1942, after graduating with a B.S. degree in physics, Ney married June Felsing. They had four children: Judy, John, Arthur, and William. That year, Ney took his bride and two of Nier's mass spectrographs to Charlottesville, Virginia, where he began graduate studies with Jesse Beams at the University of Virginia. Ney brought experience and equipment that contributed significantly to Beams's wartime project to develop gas centrifuges for separation of uranium isotopes. With Beams as his thesis advisor, Ney measured the self-diffusion coefficient of uranium hexafluoride. At the time, his results were classified, but in 1947, they were published in the Physical Review. In 1946, Ney received his Ph.D. in physics and became an assistant professor at the University of Virginia. With Beams and Leland Swoddy, he began an underground cosmic ray experiment in Endless Caverns near New Market, Virginia Return to Minnesota John T. Tate, was an influential professor of physics at the University of Minnesota, who was Nier's mentor and editor of the Physical Review. After the war, he recognized the research potential of large plastic balloons, which had been invented by Jean Piccard and were being manufactured at the General Mills Laboratories in the Como neighborhood of Minneapolis. Here, Otto C. Winzen used polyethylene to make balloons whose performance at high altitudes was better than the cellophane ones developed by Piccard. In 1947, because of Ney's interest in cosmic rays, Tate offered him a position as assistant professor, which was immediately accepted. Except for a sabbatical and two brief leaves of absence, Ney spent the rest of his life at Minnesota. At center right, a primary cosmic ray heavy nucleus goes vertically through a cloud chamber, which was suspended under a balloon near the top of the atmosphere. At left, a Helium nucleus enters through the side of the chamber. Thin tracks are singly charged particles moving at nearly the speed of light. Note that this is a negative image, in which white droplets appear black, and that the horizontal bars are electrodes that do not introduce any material into the chamber. Photo provided by James A. Earl Discovery of heavy cosmic ray nuclei Back in Minneapolis, Ney met Frank Oppenheimer and Edward J. Lofgren, who had both arrived about a year earlier. In response to Tate's initiative, these three decided to use balloons to study primary cosmic rays at the top of the atmosphere. At first, they focused on developing cloud chambers small enough to fly on balloons, but soon realized that nuclear emulsions offer a more portable way to detect energetic particles. To take charge of emulsion work, they enlisted a graduate student, Phyllis S. Freier, as the fourth member of their group. Later, she became a renowned professor. In 1948, the Minnesota group collaborated with Bernard Peters and Helmut L. Bradt, of the University of Rochester, to launch a balloon flight carrying a cloud chamber and emulsions. This flight gave evidence for heavy nuclei among the cosmic rays. More specifically, the researchers discovered that, in addition to Hydrogen nuclei (protons), primary cosmic rays contain substantial numbers of fast moving nuclei of elements from Helium to Iron. In ordinary matter, atoms of these elements consist of a nucleus surrounded by a cloud of electrons, but when the nuclei arrive as cosmic rays, they are devoid of electrons, because of collisions with atoms in interstellar matter. In both emulsions and cloud chambers, these \\"stripped\\" heavy nuclei leave an unmistakable track, which is much denser and \\"hairier\\" than that of protons, and whose characteristics make it possible to determine their atomic number. In further flights, the group showed that the abundances of elements in cosmic rays are similar to those found on earth and in stars. These results had a major impact, for they showed that studies of cosmic radiation could play a significant role in astrophysics. Shortly after these discoveries, Lofgren left for California to build the Bevatron. In 1949, Oppenheimer was forced to resign from the Minnesota faculty, because he had concealed his prewar membership in the Communist Party USA. That year, John R. Winckler joined Minnesota's cosmic ray group. In 1950, with the aid of a cloud chamber that contained lead plates, Ney, together with Charles Critchfield and graduate student Sophie Oleksa, searched for primary cosmic ray electrons. They did not find them, but in 1960, James Earl, who joined the Minnesota group in 1958, used similar apparatus to discover a small primary electron component. During the decade from 1950 to 1960, Ney's cosmic ray research shifted away from cloud chambers toward emulsions. However, his graduate students used counter controlled cloud chambers to make significant advances in electronic instrumentation for the detection and analysis of cosmic rays. Specifically, in 1954, John Linsley used a cloud chamber triggered by a cherenkov detector to study the charge distribution of heavy nuclei, and in 1955, Frank McDonald used one triggered by a scintillation counter for a similar purpose. Later, McDonald combined these two electronic detectors into a balloon instrument that served as a prototype for devices carried on many spacecraft. Balloon technology Figure 1. From a patent: Tension Component Measuring Means US Patent and Trademark Office Although early plastic balloons performed spectacularly in a few cases, there were dangerous mishaps during launch and many unexplained failures in flight. Ney realized that this unreliability was due to inadequate engineering and a fundamental lack of understanding of balloon physics. In response, he collaborated with Critchfield and Winckler to carry out a project entitled \\"Research and Development in the Field of High Altitude Plastic Balloons\\", which was sponsored by the US Army, Navy, and Air Force under a contract with the Office of Naval Research, Nonr-710 (01), which was in force from December 1951 until August 1956. During the Cold War, the United States sponsored several heavily funded and top secret attempts to carry out surveillance of the Soviet Union by means of balloon overflights. These included: Project Mogul, Project Moby Dick, and Project Genetrix. In July 1958, responding to the disappointing results of these efforts and to the deployment of the Lockheed U-2, President Eisenhower ordered an end to balloon surveillance. Because the secret programs made use of information from the Minnesota balloon project, it too was secret, but all its materials were declassified in 1958. While the project was active, Ney and his coworkers carried out 313 major or experimental balloon flights, published 16 technical reports, and patented approximately 20 inventions. The final report lists 62 major innovations and achievements. The innovations include the duct appendix, the natural shape balloon, the Minnesota launch system, and the tetroon balloon design. The last achievement listed was the post-project flight of a mylar tetroon on September 7, 1956, which reached a maximum height of 145,000 feet (44,000 m) over Minneapolis. At the time, this was a record altitude for balloons, and there was considerable press coverage of the flight. Most of the project's balloons were launched at the University of Minnesota Airport in New Brighton, Minnesota. They were among more than 1000 flights launched here from 1948 until the airport was devastated by a tornado on May 6, 1965. Key personnel of the project were: Raymond W. Maas and William F. Huch, who provided engineering expertise, Rudolph B. Thorness, who was in charge of the physics machine shop, Robert L. Howard, who ran the electronics shop, and Leland S. Bohl, who worked on the project while earning his Ph.D. under Ney. Many of their names appear as authors not only of patents and technical reports, but also of scientific publications. In spite of its secrecy, many of the project's balloons carried instruments for open scientific research. For example, from January 20, 1953, until February 4, 1953, with Winzen Research, Inc, the project launched 13 flights at Pyote Air Force Base in Texas. Several of these carried packages for cosmic ray research, one of which was designated as \\"ballast\\". These were Skyhook flights, which is the generic term used by the Office of Naval Research to designate balloon flights whose primary objectives were scientific, rather than military. Some milestones of more than 1500 Skyhook flights are: the first Skyhook launch (1947), the first shipboard launch (1949), the Rockoon program (1952), the tetroon record flight of September 1956, Stratoscope (1957 - 1971), and Skyhook Churchill (1959 - 1976). In 1960, the National Center for Atmospheric Research was established. On October 17, 1961, its panel on scientific balloons met to select a permanent launch site for balloon operations. Members of this panel, whose chairman was Verner E. Suomi, were Ney, Charles B. Moore, Alvin Howell, James K. Angell, J. Allen Hynek, and Martin Schwarzschild, who was the prime mover behind Stratoscope. They chose Palestine, Texas, where the National Scientific Balloon Facility (NSBF) was created in 1962. Since then, thousands of balloons have been launched there, and it has served as the base for flight expeditions all over the world. The Minnesota balloon project pioneered procedures and equipment used in Skyhook, NSBF, and the manned flights of Projects Stratolab and Manhigh. These include launch methods, design of reliable balloons, knowledge of atmospheric structure, and reliable instrumentation for flight control and tracking. Atmospheric physics During the balloon project, winds and temperatures in the atmosphere were prime subjects for investigation, for they have a critical impact on balloon performance. To map out upper level winds, Professor Homer T. Mantis used \\"down cameras\\", which photographed features on the ground. Ney was interested in studying variations of air temperature with altitude. To measure them, he put thermistors and wire thermometers on many flights. With the aid of standard radiosonde equipment, Ney's student, John L. Gergen, carried out 380 radiation temperature soundings in parallel with the balloon project. With Leland Bohl, and Suomi, he invented and patented the \\"black ball\\", which is an instrument that responds not to air temperature, but to thermal radiation in the atmosphere. After 1956, the Office of Naval Research continued to support, under Nonr-710 (22), Minnesota's research in atmospheric physics. While this grant was in force, and earlier during the balloon project, Ney's students made major contributions, which he summarized as follows: > John Kroening studied atmospheric small ions, invented a chemiluminescent > ozone detector, and did a seminal study of atmospheric ozone. John Gergen > designed the \\"black ball\\" and studied atmospheric radiation balance, > culminating in a national series of radiation soundings in which a majority > of the weather bureau stations took part.

Ted Pepin > participated in photographic observations from balloon platforms, and has > subsequently carried this interest further with optical observations of the > Earth's limb from satellites. Solar energetic particles and the IGY The International Geophysical Year (IGY) was an international scientific initiative that lasted from July 1, 1957, to December 31, 1958. Because its agenda included studies of cosmic rays, Ney served on the IGY's US National Committee - Technical Panel on Cosmic Rays. Other members of the panel were: Scott E. Forbush (chairman), Serge A. Korff, H. Victor Neher, J. A. Simpson, S. F. Singer and J. A. Van Allen. With Winckler and Freier, Ney proposed to keep balloons aloft (nearly) continuously to monitor the intensity of cosmic rays during the period of maximum solar activity that coincided with the IGY. When this ambitious proposal was funded, Freier and Ney took responsibility for emulsion packs that went on every flight, and Winckler designed a payload that combined an ionization chamber with a geiger counter. On the first day of the IGY, this scheme paid off, when Winckler and his students, Laurence E. Peterson, Roger Arnoldy and Robert Hoffman, observed X rays whose intensity followed temporal variations of an aurora over Minneapolis. A few weeks later, Winckler and Peterson observed a brief burst of gamma rays from a Solar Flare. During the balloon project, Ney's research on cosmic-rays became less intense, but he continued to work with Freier and guided student work in the field. He became more active, in anticipation of IGY, when Peter Fowler came to Minnesota in 1956/57. Fowler, Freier and Ney measured the intensity of Helium nuclei as a function of energy. They found that, at high energies, the intensity exhibited a steep decrease with increasing energy, but at lower energies, it peaked and then decreased at even lower energies. Because the peak intensity varied within the solar cycle, these measurements were an early observation of the solar modulation of low-energy galactic cosmic rays. After Fowler had returned to Bristol, Freier, Ney and Winckler observed a very high intensity of particles on March 26, 1958, which examination of the emulsions proved were mostly low-energy protons, and which were associated with a solar flare. This was surprising, because the earth's magnetic field would normally have prevented these particles from reaching Minnesota. Consequently, the team concluded that a geomagnetic storm, which was underway during the event, had distorted the field enough to admit protons. Later, these influxes of solar energetic particles, whose discovery was an important achievement of IGY, became designated as solar proton events. Along with geomagnetic storms, they are important phenomena of space weather, and their intensive study continues in an effort to understand the propagation of charged particles in interplanetary space. After the IGY ended, Ney's interest in cosmic rays began to diminish, but in 1959, he wrote an often cited paper Cosmic Rays and the Weather, in which \\"he was probably the first person to discuss climatological effects of cosmic rays\\". Dim Light In 1959, Ney and his colleague Paul J. Kellogg developed a theory of the solar corona based on the idea that some of its light is synchrotron radiation emitted by energetic electrons spiraling in solar magnetic fields. This theory predicted that the polarization of coronal light would exhibit a component perpendicular to that arising from Thomson scattering of sunlight, which had been widely considered to be the source of coronal luminosity. To test this theory, Ney developed an \\"eclipse polarimeter\\", to measure the intensity and direction of coronal polarization during a total solar eclipse. Ney and his colleagues decided to perform these measurements during the eclipse of October 2, 1959, which was visible from North Africa, where there was only a small chance that clouds over the Sahara would spoil the observations. In July, Ney went to French West Africa to set up logistical support for an expedition. Here, a military truck, in which he was scouting locations to view the eclipse, overturned, and Ney suffered seven broken ribs, a broken collarbone and a broken leg. By October, Ney had recovered enough to return to Africa, where he and his colleagues deployed three polarimeters along the track of the total eclipse. One of these was clouded over, but the other two returned good data. The results disproved the theory of Kellogg and Ney. To confirm and extend these observations, Ney organized an expedition to The Forks, Maine and Senneterre, Quebec, where he set up two polarimeters to measure the corona during the eclipse of July 20, 1963. In coordination with these measurements, two balloons were launched into the path of totality with cameras to record the zodiacal light. Zodiacal cameras were also launched in Australia by V. D. Hopper and J. G. Sparrow, and astronaut Scott Carpenter took photographs of the corona from an aircraft at 40,000 feet over Canada. Airglow and lightning over Australia; Photographed from Faith 7 by Gordon Cooper Ney's studies of the corona piqued his curiosity about other sources of dim light within the solar system. Consequently, Ney and Huch developed reliable cameras whose low F-number enhanced their ability to record dim light, but sacrificed picture sharpness. This compromise proved to be appropriate for the dim and diffuse zodiacal light and airglow. On May 15, 1963, aboard Faith 7, one of Ney's cameras was operated in space by Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper. According to Ney's student John E. Naugle, NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, one of its images was: \\".... the first photograph of the night airglow taken from above.\\" NASA designated Ney's experiment as \\"S-1\\", which means that it was the first scientific experiment conducted on a manned space flight. Later, aboard Geminis, 5, 9, 10, and 11, astronauts photographed the Zodiacal Light and the gegenschein, which had been obscured in the Mercury missions by nightglow. Ney followed up his zodiacal experiments on manned space missions by putting instruments aboard the Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO). The observations showed that zodiacal light is highly polarized, and that its intensity and polarization are nearly constant in time. The OSO instruments also recorded terrestrial lightning and demonstrated the remarkable fact that there are ten times as many flashes over the land as over the ocean. This difference remains unexplained. Infrared astronomy In 1963, Ney went to Australia on sabbatical leave, where he helped Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss to construct the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer. When he returned, Ney left behind a working instrument, but with the advice of Fred Hoyle, who he met in Australia, had decided to focus his attention on a field of broader scope: infrared astronomy. His students, Wayne Stein and Fred Gillett, who had participated in the eclipse expeditions, were eager to work in this area. At this time, there were only two infrared astronomers: Frank J. Low, at the University of Arizona, and Gerry Neugebauer at the California Institute of Technology. To learn more, Ney and his technician, Jim Stoddart, went to Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, where Low, who Ney dubbed \\"The Pope of infrared astronomy\\", familiarized them with his newly developed low temperature bolometers. After Stein completed his Ph.D. in 1964, he went to Princeton University to help Professor Robert E. Danielson, an earlier Ney student, carry out infrared observations on Stratoscope II. Similarly, Larry Peterson convinced Gillett to begin a program in infrared astronomy at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Soon, Stein joined Gillett at UCSD. Until Ney began his infrared studies, astronomical research at Minnesota had been carried out mainly by Willem Luyten, who was an expert on white dwarf stars and is credited with coining this name in 1922. When Luyten retired in 1967, he was replaced by Nick Woolf, who had been involved with Stratoscope II, and whom Ney had recruited from the University of Texas. With this addition, the department's research emphasis shifted decisively to infrared astronomy, and Minnesota became a significant presence in this nascent field. O'Brien Observatory Infrared astronomy began at Minnesota under a severe competitive disadvantage: the lack of a nearby observatory. Because infrared radiation is primarily absorbed by atmospheric water vapor, infrared observatories were typically on mountain tops, above which there is minimal water. From his knowledge of atmospheric physics, Ney realized that, during its cold winters, the air above Minnesota was as free of water as that above a high mountain. Armed with this insight, he approached Nancy Boggess, who had just taken responsibility for NASA's infrared astronomy programs, and who quickly authorized funding for a Minnesota observatory. Ney persuaded Thomond \\"Tomy\\" O'Brien to donate a site on the hills above Marine on St. Croix, Minnesota, which is about 22 miles northeast of Minneapolis. Another 180 acre parcel from the extensive holdings of Thomond's grandfather formed the nucleus of William O'Brien State Park, two miles upriver from Marine. The 30 inch Cassegrain reflector, with which Ney fitted out O'Brien Observatory, saw first light in August 1967. That winter, it was put to use by Ney and Stein. The next winter, Woolf and Ney discovered that infrared radiation from certain cool stars exhibits a spectral feature which indicates that they are surrounded by grains of carbon and silicate minerals. Within two years, further work by the Minnesota/UCSD group established that these grains, from which planets are formed, are ubiquitous in circumstellar winds and regions of star formation. At O'Brien, Ney and his Australian colleague, David Allen, carried out imaging studies of the lunar surface which revealed temperature anomalies. To explain them, Allen and Ney suggested that large rocks in contact with deep subsurface layers cooled more slowly than the loosely packed regolith. Mount Lemmon observing facility Despite the success of the O/Brien Observatory, the Minnesota/UCSD group realized that they needed regular access to a large infrared telescope located at a high altitude site. Consequently, Stein, Gillett, Woolf and Ney proposed to construct a 60-inch infrared telescope. They obtained funding from their two universities, the National Science Foundation, and from Fred Hoyle, who offered a contribution with the understanding that aspiring British infrared astronomers would be trained at Minnesota. After Woolf's student, Robert Gehrz, completed a search for suitable sites, the group decided on Mount Lemmon, whose proximity to a source of liquid helium at the University of Arizona greatly simplified the logistics. The observatory was named the Mount Lemmon Observing Facility (MLOF). It achieved first light in December 1970. Teaching Ney loved to teach. In 1961 he gave the Minnesota department's first honors course in modern physics. He wrote up his lectures as Ney's Notes on Relativity, which were published as the book Electromagnetism and Relativity. In 1964, Ney received Minnesota's outstanding teaching award. Retirement In 1982, Ney had a serious heart attack. It was followed by open heart surgery on November 28 of that year, which left him with ventricular tachycardia for the rest of his life. Taking an active role in the treatment of this condition, Ney applied his knowledge of physics to the study of cardiology and of his heart's electrical system. This illness slowed Ney down for a few years, but he eventually began to study the effect of radon gas in the atmosphere. He thought that the ionization from radon, which comes from radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in rocks, might account for the high frequency of lightning over land, which had been demonstrated on OSO. This research continued after his retirement in 1990, but did not reach a conclusion before he died on July 9, 1996. Impact and legacy Frank Low summarized Ney's career: > Ed Ney at Minnesota had a strong belief that being at the scientific > forefront meant doing new and difficult things that few others were doing > and doing them better. He also felt that to be the best at what you do and > the master of your future, you had to be able to learn how to create and > advance all of the technology in your own house rather than collaborating > too closely with outsiders. Ed's eclectic interests led him in a natural > progression from the Manhattan Project, to measurements of cosmic rays, to > studies of the physics of balloon flight, to atmospheric and solar physics, > to research on the solar corona and the zodiacal light, and finally into the > world of astronomy. Doctoral students A less visible impact is that made by Ney's students after they finished their PhDs. In 1959, John Naugle joined Goddard Space Flight Center, and in 1960, took charge of the National Aeronautical and Space Administration's particles and fields research program. Later, he became associate administrator for NASA's Office of Space Science, and from 1977 until 1981, served as NASA Chief Scientist. Similarly, Frank McDonald joined Goddard in 1959 as head of the Energetic Particles Branch in the Space Science Division, where he was project scientist on nine satellite programs. In 1982 he became NASA Chief Scientist, serving until 1987, when he returned to Goddard as associate director/chief scientist. At Princeton Bob Danielson played a key role in the Stratoscope project, where he was a pioneer of infrared astronomy. James M. Rosen became a professor at the University of Wyoming Department of Physics and Astronomy, where he studied atmospheric dust and aerosols. He was also instrumental in the founding of the Wyoming Infrared Observatory, which was built by Robert Gherz and John Hackwell, another Ney student. In 1973, Fred Gillett moved from UCSD to Kitt Peak National Observatory where he helped to develop the Infrared Astronomical Satellite. His investigations on this mission revealed the \\"Vega phenomenon\\", which refers to dust in orbit around certain young stars. This discovery provided the first solid evidence that planet formation occurs throughout the galaxy. From 1987 to 1989, he was a visiting senior scientist at NASA headquarters, where he played a major role in defining the future of infrared astronomy. More specifically, he made major technical and programmatic contributions to the Space Infrared Telescope, which was renamed the Spitzer Space Telescope after its launch in 2003, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, which consists of a large infrared telescope aboard an airplane, and 2MASS, which is an infrared all-sky survey. After this administrative interlude, he went to the Gemini Observatory, where he became Project Scientist. After Gillett's untimely death on April 22, 2001, the telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, was officially named the Fredrick C. Gillett Gemini Telescope.

It is popular in the United States and in The Gambia. In New England cuisine, oyster stew is often associated with Thanksgiving. In Southern United States cuisine, oyster stew is often prepared on Christmas Eve. There have been a number of different explanations offered for oyster stew being traditionally consumed on Christmas Eve. Bill Neal suggests that before the acceptance of refrigerated food transport, sufficient cold weather for shipping was not guaranteed before December, and so \\"Far from the coast, oysters became a symbol of the arrival of the winter holiday season, appearing in the markets by Christmas Eve and on tables that night as oyster stew. Stephanie Butler, however, gives an alternate explanation: Irish Catholic immigrants would not eat meat on Christmas Eve, and were used to eating ling fish stew instead. Butler suggests that \\"oysters taste pretty similar to dried ling: they're salty, briny and can be quite chewy. The ling stew recipe was quickly adapted for oysters.\\" The basic southern oyster stew is made with milk and cream. Oyster stew is often served with oyster crackers, and that may be the origin of the cracker's name. Oyster stew is also a popular dish in Gambian cuisine.

He is one of the competitors in CMLL's Micro-Estrella (\\"Micro-Star\\") division where he competes with and against other wrestlers with dwarfism. He started his career working as a Mascota, a smaller version of a regular-sized wrestler, paired with El Alebrije, working under the name Cuije in AAA. Cuije and El Alebrije would on occasion team up and have collectively won the AAA Mascot Tag Team Championship and holds the record for the longest reign with that championship. The duo also competed in Chikara's King of Trios tournament. He began working for CMLL in 2010 as part of the Los Invasores group. His name was changed to Mije in 2012 following a lawsuit against AAA over the copyright of the characters Cuije and El Alebrije. Professional wrestling career AAA (1998–2009) Alebrije and Cuije during a match. In 1998, the Mexican professional wrestling promotion AAA introduced the wrestling character El Alebrije, a bright, colorful comedic character based on the Alebrije figures. AAA paired up El Alebrije with a mascotas, a smaller version of the character portrayed by a little person, called Cuije. The duo was often paired up against Monsther and his diminutive sidekick Chucky for a long- running storyline feud between the two teams. During this period of time, Cuije rarely wrestled, with his first recorded match taking place in April 2002 in Monterrey, where he lost to Chucky. The colorful duo teamed up with Máscara Sagrada and Mascarita Sagrada as part of the 2003 Verano de Escándalo (\\"Summer of Scandal\\") show, where they lost to Los Headhunters (I and II) and Los Mini Head Hunters (I and II). On August 20, 2004 Cuije and El Alebrije won the AAA Mascot Tag Team Championship by defeating champions Máscara Sagrada/Mascarita Sagrada as well as Monsther/Chucky and Psicosis/Mini Psicosis to win the title. They would defend the championship in subsequent years, primarily against Chucky and Monsther. Their final official AAA Mascota Tag Team Championship match took place on December 2, 2007, where they defeated Chucky and Monsther and the team of Guapito and Scorpio Jr. Independent circuit (2009–2010) In April 2009 Cuije and El Alebrije left AAA, citing their dissatisfaction with the amount of opportunities they were given in recent years. After leaving AAA Alebrije, with Cuije at his side, began working on the Mexican independent circuit, especially for International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) and Perros del Mal Producciones. While Cuije and El Alebrije continued to use the names they were given by AAA, the company claimed that they owned the characters. To try and address this issue the team began working as \\"Pequeño Cuije\\" \\"Little Cuije\\") and \\"Gran Alebrije\\" (\\"Big Alebrije\\") when appearing for Extreme Air Wrestling. El Alebrije and Cuije made their first appearance for the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Chikara as part of the 2010 King of Trios tournament that ran from April 23 to 25 at The Arena in Philadelphia. For the tournament Cuije wrestled alongside Alebrije El Oriental as Team Perros del Mal. After defeating \\"Team Delicioso\\" (Curry Man, El Hijo del Ice Cream and Ice Cream Jr.) in their opening round match, Team Perros del Mal was eliminated from the tournament in the quarterfinals by Der Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (Ares, Claudio Castagnoli and Tursas). Cuije and El Alebrije were never officially stripped of the AAA Mascot Tag Team Championship and on November 23, 2011, the team lost a match to El Pulpito and El Pulpo in Rio Bravo, Tamaulipa where Los Pulpos were given the championship belts, even though the match was not officially recognized by AAA. Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (2010–present) On April 12, 2010 a contingent of former AAA wrestlers including Cuije, El Alebrije, Histeria, Psicosis II and Maniaco appeared on a Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) show in Puebla, Puebla. The group drowe into the arena in a black SUV and attacked La Sombra, El Hijo del Fantasma, and La Máscara after they just finished wrestling. Brazo de Plata, Místico and Jon Strongman tried to help out but were kept away by CMLL rudos Averno, El Texano Jr., and El Terrible. Following the attack, the former AAA wrestlers returned to the SUV and left the arena. After weeks of run-ins the group, dubbed Los Independientes or \\"The Independents\\" after the Independent circuit, wrestled their first match for CMLL. In their debut for CMLL on April 26, 2010, El Alebrije, Histeria, and Psicosis defeated El Hijo del Fantasma, La Máscara, and La Sombra as Cuije helped them cheat throughout the match. While Los Invasores disbanded the following year Alebrije and Cuije became a regular fixture on CMLL shows, often with Cuije clashing with fellow mascotas KeMonito and Zacarías el Perico, and brawls between any of the Mascotas usually drew a loud reaction from the crowd. In January 2012, CMLL repackaged Cuije, Alebrije, and Histeria with new ring characters. Alebrije returned to performing under the Kraneo gimmick, while Cuije was renamed Mije, which was done because AAA claimed the copyright ownership of the names and characters. In early 2017 CMLL recruited Mije and fellow mascota Zacarías to help establish a Micro-Estrellas (\\"Micro- Stars\\") division, featuring only wrestlers with dwarfism. The first match of the Micro-Estrellas division took place on April 30, 2017, which saw Microman and El Gallito defeat Mije and Zacarías in a special featured match. Mije and the Micro-Estrellas would appear on various CMLL shows, as well as making special appearances on the Mexican independent circuit, such as The Crash Lucha Libre, Promociones El Cholo, or Desastre Total Ultraviolento. For the first anniversary of the Micro-Estrellas division, CMLL held an eight-micros torneo cibernético elimination match, featuring the entire active Micro- Estrella division at the time. Mije, Angelito, Chamuel, and El Gallito take on Microman, Átomo, Guapito, and Zacarías. In the end, Microman pinned Chamuel to win the tournament while Mije was the third man eliminated from the match. For the 2018 Día de Muertos (\\"Day of the Dead\\") supercard show Mije, Chamuel, and Zacarías lost to Microman, Átomo, and El Gallito, two falls to one. Four weeks later the Micro-Estrellas also appeared at CMLL's Leyendas Mexicanas (\\"Mexican Legends\\") show where Mije, Chamuel, and Zacarías lost to Microman, El Gallito, and Guapito in the second match of the night. At the 2019 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (\\"Homage to two legends\\") show Mije, Chamuel, Zacarías el Perico once again lost.

He previously played for the Penrith Panthers, Parramatta Eels and the Wests Tigers in the NRL. He was able to cover a number of positions in the backs. Playing career A Blackwater Crushers junior, and a student at St. Brendan's College, Yeppoon, Humble played in the North Queensland Cowboys NYC team in 2008, and the club's feeder team, Northern Pride in 2009. Humble said of his time with the Cowboys, \\"I was 18th man a few times but I never got a start in first grade. I would have liked to but I was still pretty young when I was there and I wasn't ready.\\" In 2010, Humble joined the Parramatta Eels. He made his NRL debut midway through the season. He made 6 appearances for the year, scoring 2 tries in games where he started at fullback, covering for an injured Jarryd Hayne. After his appearances in top grade, Humble was suspended after testing positive to methylhexaneamine, a banned stimulant, while playing for the Eel's feeder club. It was reported that he had, \\"unwittingly ingested the substance in a performance supplement that was routinely provided to Wentworthville players before games.\\" Humble joined the Wests Tigers for the 2012 season, starting the first match from the bench. However, a season-ending injury to James Tedesco saw him taking over as the team's starting fullback. Humble said at the time, \\"At this stage of my career I need to lock myself into one spot and that is fullback.\\" Only weeks later, Tim Moltzen had been shifted to fullback, and Humble was playing at halfback. In the second half of the season, Humble played a number of games from the bench or playing hooker when Robbie Farah was unavailable. Described as, \\"the ultimate utility,\\" Humble said, \\"I'm only 20 games in and wherever (coach) Tim Sheens puts me, I'll do the job to the best of my ability.\\" Humble finished the season playing for feeder team Balmain Ryde Eastwood Tigers and was a member of the side that lost the NSW Cup grand final. In November 2012, Humble signed a deal to join the Penrith Panthers for two years. He made 6 appearances at five-eighth early in the 2013 season, but played no further first grade. Humblee signed on with the Townsville Blackhawks in October, 2014 for their inaugural season in the Queensland Cup in 2015.

In round 17 against Manly-Warringah, Reynolds kicked a field goal in the dying minutes as South Sydney won 21-20 at ANZ Stadium breaking a four game losing streak. South Sydney would finished the 2019 regular season in third spot on the table and qualified for the finals. Reynolds played in all three of South Sydney's finals matches as the club reached the preliminary final for a second straight year but were defeated by Canberra 16-10 at Canberra Stadium. 2020 On 25 February, Reynolds was announced as the new captain of South Sydney. Reynolds spoke to the media saying \\"I grew up across the road from Redfern Oval in apartments on Elizabeth Street and always wanted to play for Souths, so to have the chance to captain the team is amazing\\". In round 14, Reynolds scored a try, kicked five goals and a last-gasp field goal as South Sydney defeated North Queensland 31-30 at the Queensland Country Bank Stadium. In round 15, Reynolds kicked nine goals from nine attempts as South Sydney defeated Manly-Warringah 56-16 at ANZ Stadium. In round 20, he kicked ten goals in South Sydney's 60-8 victory over bitter rivals the Sydney Roosters at ANZ Stadium.

The love of Christ is a central element of Christian belief and theology.Christian theology: the spiritual tradition (2002) by John Glyndwr Harris. . Page 193. It refers to the love of Jesus Christ for humanity, the love of Christians for Christ, and the love of Christians for others. These aspects are distinct in Christian teachings--the love for Christ is a reflection of his love for his followers. The theme of love is the key element of Johannine writings. This is evidenced in one of the most widely quoted scriptures in the Bible: (John 3:16) ”For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.” In the Gospel of John, the pericope of the Good Shepherd (John 10:1-21) symbolizes the sacrifice of Jesus based on his love for people. In that gospel, love for Christ results in the following of his commandments, the Farewell Discourse (14:23) stating: \\"If a man loves me, he will keep my word\\". In the First Epistle of John (4:19), the reflexive nature of this love is highlighted: \\"We love, because he first loved us\\", expressing the love of Christ as a mirroring of Christ's own love. Towards the end of the Last Supper, Jesus gives his disciples a new commandment: \\"Love one another, as I have loved you ... By this shall all men know that you are my disciples.\\" The love of Christ is also a motif in the Letters of Paul. The basic theme of the Epistle to the Ephesians is that of God the Father initiating the work of salvation through Christ, who willingly sacrifices himself based on his love and obedience to the Father. Ephesians 5:25 states \\"Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it\\". Ephesians 3:17-19 relates the love of Christ to the knowledge of Christ and considers loving Christ to be a necessity for knowing him. Many prominent Christian figures have expounded on the love of Christ. Saint Augustine wrote that \\"the common love of truth unites people, the common love of Christ unites all Christians\\". Saint Benedict instructed his monks to \\"prefer nothing to the love of Christ\\".Walled about with God (2005) by Jean Prou and David Hayes. Page 113. Saint Thomas Aquinas stated that although both Christ and God the Father had the power to restrain those who killed Christ on Calvary, neither did, due to the perfection of the love of Christ. Aquinas also opined that, given that \\"perfect love\\" casts out fear, Christ had no fear when he was crucified, for his love was all-perfect. Saint Teresa of Avila considered perfect love to be an imitation of the love of Christ.Teresa of Avila (2004) by Rowan Williams. . Page 108. Love of Christ for his followers Notre-Dame Cathedral, Paris. The love of Christ for his disciples and for humanity as a whole is a theme that repeats both in Johannine writings and in several of the Pauline Epistles. John 13:1, which begins the narrative of the Last Supper, describes the love of Christ for his disciples: \\"having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them unto the end.\\" This use of \\"to the end\\" in Greek (in which the gospel was written) may also be translated as \\"to the utmost\\".1-3 John, Volume 5 (2007) by John MacArthur. . Page 230. In the First Epistle of John (4:19) the reflexive nature of this love is highlighted: \\"We love, because he first loved us\\", expressing the origin of the love as a mirroring of Christ's love. The theology of the intercession of Christ from Heaven after he left the earth, draws upon his continued love for his followers and his ongoing desire to bring them to salvation as in 1 John 2:1-2 and Romans 8:34.Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Part 13 (2003) by James Hastings and John A. Selbie. . Page 384. In many Christological models, the love of Christ for his followers is not mediated by any other means but is direct. It resembles the love of the shepherd for his sheep, and the nourishment that the Vine (cf. John 15:1-17) provides for the branches.Who do you say that I am? Essays on Christology (1999) by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell and David R. Bauer. . Pages 255–256. In other models, the love is partially delegated to the apostles who formed the early church, and through them, it is passed to their successors. The pericope of the Good Shepherd appears about midway through the Gospel of John (10:1-21), and in John 1-11 Jesus states that as the good shepherd he will lay down his life for his sheep.Commentary on John (1993) by Thomas Whitelaw. . Page 229. This concept is then basis of Jesus' commands to Apostle Peter after his resurrection and before his Ascension to Heaven. In John 21:15-17, a resurrected Jesus asks Peter three times, \\"Do you love me?\\" And as a response, Jesus commands Peter three times to \\"feed my lambs\\", \\"tend my sheep\\" and \\"feed my sheep\\", implying that love for Christ should translate to loving actions and care for his followers.Thematic Guide to Biblical Literature (2007) by Nancy M. Tischler. . Pages 65–67.To Praise, to Bless, to Preach: Spiritual Reflections on the Sunday Gospels (2000) by Peter John Cameron. . Pages 71–72. The basic theme of the Epistle to the Ephesians is that of God the Father initiating the work of salvation through Christ, who is not merely a passive instrument in this scenario but takes an active role in the work of salvation. In Ephesians 5:1-2, Paul calls upon the Ephesians to be imitators of God: :Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children; and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God. Paul continues this idea in Ephesians 5:25 and states that: \\"Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it\\".New Testament Christology (1999) by Frank J. Matera. . Pages 155–156. The discussion of the love expressed by Christ throughout the New Testament is part of the overall theme of the outpouring of love from a merciful God and Christ's participation in it. In John 14:31, Jesus explains that his sacrificial act was performed so \\"that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.\\" This verse includes the only direct statement by Jesus in the New Testament about his love for the Father.Preaching the Gospel of John: proclaiming the living Word (2004) by Lamar Williamson. . Page 192. In the Book of Revelation (19:7-9), the imagery of the wedding feast of the Lamb represents the celebration of the culmination of this cycle of love and mercy of God, which begins in the first chapter of the Book of Genesis, and ends in salvation.Dictionary of biblical imagery (1998) by Leland Ryken. . Page 122. Love of Christians for Christ Detail of a Pietro Lorenzetti fresco showing the death of Christ, Assisi, c. 1320. In the New Testament The theme of love is the key element of Johannine writings: \\"God loves Christ, Christ loves God, God loves humanity, and Christians love God through their love for Christ\\". Christians are bound together through their mutual love, which is a reflection of their love for Christ.The Gospel of John: The New Daily Study Bible, Vol 2 (2001) by William Barclay. . Page 197.

In John 14:15, Jesus states, \\"If you love me, you will keep my commandments.\\" and John 14:23 reconfirms that: \\"If a man love me, he will keep my word\\".The People's New Testament Commentary (2005) by M.

In John 13:34-35, during the Last Supper, after the departure of Judas, and just before the start of the Farewell Discourse, Jesus gives a new commandment to his eleven remaining disciples: \\"Love one another; as I have loved you\\" and states that: \\"By this shall all men know that you are my disciples.\\" Outside of Johannine literature, the earliest New Testament reference to the love for Christ is 1 Corinthians 16:22--\\"If any man loveth not the Lord, let him be anathema\\".A Commentary on I Peter (1993) by Leonhard Goppelt, Ferdinand Hahn and John Alsup. . In 2 Corinthians 5:14-15, Paul discusses how the love of Christ is a guiding force and establishes a link between Christ's sacrifice and the activities of Christians:Christology in context (1988) by Marinus de Jonge. . Page 38. : For the love of Christ controls us; for we are convinced that one died for all, therefore all died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again. However, Paul assures the Corinthians that he is not trying to commend himself to them. The love of Christ controls his ministry because of his conviction in the saving power of the sacrifice of Christ.New Testament Christology (1999) by Frank J. Matera. . Page 100. This dovetails into Paul's Second Adam Christology in 1 Corinthians 15 in which the birth, death and Resurrection of Jesus liberate Christians from the transgressions of Adam. In the First Epistle to the Corinthians (13:8-13), Paul views love of Christ as the key element that makes a personal communion with God possible, based on the three activities of \\"faith in Christ\\", \\"hope in Christ\\" and \\"love for Christ\\".Christ, the sacrament of the encounter with God (1987) by Edward Schillebeeckx. . Page 182. In 1 Corinthians 13:13, he states: \\"Abide in faith, hope and love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.\\" The love of Christ is an important theme in the Epistle to the Romans.Reading Romans: a literary and theological commentary (2008) by Luke Timothy Johnson. . Page 87. In Romans 8:35 Paul asks, \\"What can separate us from the love of Christ?\\" And he answers:A commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians (2001) by John Muddiman. . Pages 172–173. \\"Shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? ... Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.\\" The use of \\"love of Christ\\" in Romans 8:35 and the \\"love of God\\" in 8:39 reflects Paul's focus on joining Christ and God in the experience of the believer without asserting their equality.The Epistle to the Romans (1996) by Douglas J. Moo. . Page 547. In the Epistle to the Ephesians (3:17-19) Paul relates the love of Christ to the knowledge of Christ, and considers the love of Christ as a necessity for knowing him:The letters to the Galatians and Ephesians (2002) by William Barclay. . Pages 152–153. :\\"... to know the love of Christ which is beyond all knowledge, that you may be filled until you reach the fullness of God himself.\\" Paul views the knowledge of Christ obtained through the \\"immeasurable love of Christ\\" (as in Ephesians 3:17-19) as surpassing other forms of spiritual knowledge, as in 1 Corinthians 2:12 which considers \\"spiritual knowledge\\" as divine knowledge acting within the human mind. Later Christian writers Saint Augustine referred to Ephesians 3:14 and suggested that the bowing of the knees to the Father is the best way to come to know the love of Christ.The Confessions of St. Augustine (2002) by St. Augustine and Albert Cook Outler. . Pages 272–273. Then building on the concept that \\"the common love of truth unites people, the common love of Christ unites all Christians,\\" Augustine taught that faith in Christ implies community in the Church, and that the goal of Christians should be the unity of mankind.Augustine of Hippo, selected writings (1988) by Mary T. Clark and Saint Augustine of Hippo. . Page 43. Saint Benedict emphasized the importance of the love of Christ to his monks, and in keeping with the rest of his Christology, focused on the non-earthly aspects.Benedict's Rule: A Translation and Commentary (1996) by Terrence G. Kardong. . Pages 596–597. Benedict wanted his monks to love Christ as \\"he had loved us\\", and again stated the reflexive nature of the love: \\"prefer nothing to Christ, for he preferred nothing to us\\". The Rule of Benedict also reminds the monks of the presence of Christ in the most humble and the least powerful of men, who can nonetheless experience and manifest a deep love of Christ. Saint Thomas Aquinas viewed the perfect love of Christ for humanity as a key element of his willing sacrifice as the Lamb of God and stated that although both Christ and God the Father had the power to restrain those who killed Christ on Calvary, neither did, due to the perfection of the love of Christ.Aquinas on Doctrine (2004) by Thomas Weinandy, John Yocum and Daniel Keating. . Pages 123–124. Referring to 1 John and Ephesians, Aquinas stated that given that \\"perfect love\\" casts out fear, Christ had no fear, for the love of Christ was all- perfect.Summa Theologiae: Volume 49, The Grace of Christ (2006) by Thomas Aquinas and Liam G. Walsh. . Pages 21–23. Aquinas also emphasized the importance of avoiding distractions that would separate those in religious life from their love of Christ.Reading John With St. Thomas Aquinas (2005) by Michael Dauphinais and Matthew Levering. . Page 98. Saint Teresa of Avila considered perfect love to be an imitation of the love of Christ. For her, the path to perfect love included a constant awareness of the love received from God, and the acknowledgement that nothing in the human soul has a claim to the outpouring of God's unconditional love.

On 24 June, 3 months after signing a contract extension with the club, Peats went on to sign a 3-year deal with the Parramatta Eels starting in 2014. Peats commented on his signing saying, “it was a tough decision, the biggest of my life. I'm a Souths junior and love the club to death but to further my career I believe it's what's best for me, There is a long way to go before the season is over and I'm fully committed to Souths and having a year to remember\\". After round 22, where the Rabbitohs lost 26-8 against the Melbourne Storm, Peats was dropped to the NSW Cup and didn’t feature in any more matches for the Rabbitohs for the remainder of the season.

In round 1, he made his debut for Eels, against the New Zealand Warriors, playing at hooker in the 36-16 win at Parramatta Stadium. In round 2, against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Peats scored his first try for the Eels in the 18-22 loss. After good early season form, his name was thrown up with others as a potential replacement for the injured Robbie Farah at hooker for New South Wales. Unfortunately, in round 12 against the Penrith Panthers, Peats suffered a season ending anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injury. Despite his season being cut short early, Peats was branded “one of the best buys of the year”.

Peats finished his time with the Eels in the middle of the season, playing in 6 matches and scoring a try. After being asked to leave by Parramatta, Peats spoke to the media about his displeasure with the club by saying “The only regret I probably have is with myself and the things I’ve done during the games, “I’ve got my body in the wrong spot a few times for the club, for myself and for the boys and I regret that at times because now look at it, I’m the one walking away, It’s been a poorly run business to be honest in the last couple of years ... until they sort that stuff out I think it’s going to keep continuing, No-one’s going to say sorry so it is what it is, I don’t really care.

The demonstration was inspired by Occupy Wall Street and is part of the larger \\"Occupy\\" protest movement. The aim of the demonstration was to begin a sustained culture of direct action and local activism against income inequality as well as both corporate and government unaccountability in the communities of Redwood City and elsewhere along the Peninsula. Redwood City is the county seat of San Mateo County which is the site of some of California's worst examples of income disparity. Occupy Redwood City protests perceived corporate greed and social inequality, including opposing corporate influence in U.S. politics, the influence of money and corporations on democracy, and a lack of legal and political repercussions for the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Occupy Redwood City continues to meet on Fridays at 5:00 PM on Courthouse Square, with a general assembly following the rally. As of June 2012, Occupy Redwood City had continued to engage in organized meetings, events and actions. Characteristics of the local Occupy group In addition to the Friday protests in front of the historic San Mateo County Courthouse, the group has two functional committees: a Media/Communications working group and a Planning/Events working group. They are currently starting a third working group to lobby local government entities to bank with local, community banks instead of large, national banks. Chronology of events * On Saturday, September 17, 2011, Occupy Wall Street protests began in New York. * On Friday, October 28, about fifty people came together for Occupy Redwood City's first general assembly. A proposal to continue to meet weekly on Friday evenings was passed. A proposal to officially stand in support of Scott Olsen was also passed, while a proposal to take action against the controversial Cargill development was tabled after being blocked by two participants. Former Assemblymember Sally Lieber attended. * On Friday, November 11, a small group of Occupy Redwood City members spoke out in honor of veterans in the downtown theater district. * On Friday, November 25, Congresswoman Anna Eshoo visited Occupy Redwood City and participated in the general assembly. * On Monday, December 5, an Occupy Redwood City protester delivered a letter to the City Council protesting outgoing mayor Jeff Ira's negative comments about the Occupy movement. * On Tuesday, December 6, Occupy Redwood City joined with Occupy San Jose and other community activists to protest inside the downtown branch of Chase in an effort to stop a homeowner's impending foreclosure and eviction. The protesters won a two-month moratorium and a promise to work with the homeowner from the bank. * On Saturday, December 17, about two dozen people from Occupy Redwood City, Occupy San Jose, Occupy Palo Alto, Occupy Half Moon Bay, and other groups marched into the downtown branches of the Big Four banks, urging customers and employees to move their money into credit unions and independent local community banks. * On Sunday, January 1, 2012, Occupy Redwood City released a set of twelve resolutions for the New Year; together the resolutions represent the closest thing to a manifesto the group has released to date.

That was the absolute beginning point, so from then he wouldn’t speak to me unless we were talking about me getting an abortion\\". The woman went on to say “He refused to talk about the possibility of having the baby and manipulated me by saying things like, ‘How could you do this to me? How could you bring a baby into the world whose father didn’t want it? How could you ruin my career like that? You’re doing this on purpose\\".

He was also an artist notable for his portrayal on life in the Theresienstadt concentration camp.  Biography  Norbert Troller was born in Bruenn, Austria-Hungarian Empire (now Brno, Czech Republic) in 1900.Leo Baeck Institute Archives, R. Joseph collection He served as a soldier in World War I, and was taken prisoner by the Italians but released within a year. After the war, he studied architecture at the Brno Technical University, and as a postgraduate student, in the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. He then worked in various architectural firms in Brno, Czechoslovakia, as a draftsman and an architect till he had established his own practice. His projects at that time included single family residences, multifamily residential buildings, industrial buildings, banks, warehouses, department stores, shops and the interiors. His architectural practice ended abruptly with the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in the fall of 1938. As a Jew, in 1942 he was imprisoned by the Nazis in the Theresienstadt ghetto-concentration camp. The self-government of the ghetto (the Council of Elders of Theresienstadt) hired him as an architect. During this time he produced a series of graphic drawings, showing the horrible conditions of the Jews in the camp, to be smuggled to the outside world. When the Gestapo found it, he was arrested and jailed in 1944. Later that year he was sent to another concentration camp, Auschwitz. The Red Army liberated him in 1945. After the war he lived briefly in Cracow, Poland, making a living as a painter, before settling in Prague, and, finally, in his native Brno, where he was able to resume his architectural practice. His first success was to get a commission to build a major department store with offices (the VICHR building) in Brno. Other commissions followed. Yet, being aware of the imminent communist coup, he applied for an American visa in 1945, and emigrated to the US as soon as the coup happened in 1948. For the next 10 years, Norbert Troller designed Jewish Community Centers for the US, Canada and Colombia, in the Building Bureau of the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York. He produced about 80 designs of those projects.Leo Baeck Institute Archives, R. Joseph collection The local architects had realized many of them. Simultaneously, he had developed and implemented planning and construction design standards for the Jewish Community Centers’ buildings. In 1958 he opened his own practice, and was involved in the design of residential houses, interiors of offices, showrooms, retail shops and restaurants in New York City and the metropolitan area. Many times during his life, Norbert Troller successfully participated in architectural competitions: in Brno, where he held two personal exhibitions in the Art Center, and in America, where he won the First prize and four Third prizes in the Chicago Herald Tribune Better Rooms Competitions, 1949 Chicago Sunday Tribune, May 1, 1949, Part 1, page 6– 1950. In 1981 he had an exhibition of his artwork at the Yeshiva University of New York: 300 Theresienstadt drawings. He also taught in the Peoples University in Brno and in a high school in New York City. He died in 1984. In his memoirs he presented a detailed account of the Nazi atrocities in the Jewish concentration camps.

His father was a wealthy shipowner and he was educated at Princeton. At the start of the American Revolutionary War he rallied to the patriot cause and was appointed lieutenant colonel of a New Jersey state regiment. When his commander assumed command of the brigade, he was promoted colonel of the regiment during the New York and New Jersey Campaign in 1776. At the time of the battles of Trenton and Princeton Forman's regiment waged a merciless war against the American Loyalists of Monmouth County. Then and later he became known as \\"Devil David\\" for his zeal in suppressing the local Tories. In January 1777, the Continental Congress authorized him to raise Forman's Additional Continental Regiment with the rank of colonel in the Continental Army. In March 1777 he was promoted brigadier general of New Jersey militia. He led a militia brigade in an unsuccessful attack at Germantown in October 1777. He resigned his general's commission because of political troubles but continued to assist the revolutionary cause. At the Battle of Monmouth he served on the staff of Charles Lee as an adviser. When local guides failed to appear on time, he directed the vanguard on the correct route. When Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing's French fleet appeared off the coast soon afterward, Forman stepped in as a liaison between the French and George Washington. His regiment was absorbed by Spencer's Additional Continental Regiment in April 1779. He organized a system of outposts on the coast in 1780 that reported British and French ship movements.

It has become a much- recorded standard, without ever having charted as a single. Webb appropriated the title from the 1966 science fiction novel The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A. Heinlein. The song is especially associated with Glen Campbell, who performed the song on his farewell tour, Judy Collins, Linda Ronstadt, and Joe Cocker, who first recorded the song in 1974. The song is commonly presented in the key of G (to B♭). The song structure consists of three seven-line verses and a two-line coda. The first two verses have a rhyme scheme of AABACDC. The third verse modulates three half steps (from G to B♭), with the rhyme scheme altered to ABABCDC, and the coda repeating the DC. The time signature of the song is common time with the lines introduced between the second and third beat. In a 2009 interview with Lisa Torem for Penny Black Music, Jimmy Webb talked about the influence of Robert Heinlein and the song's title: Since Joe Cocker's first recording of the song in 1974, \\"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\\" has been recorded by a variety of artists, from traditional renditions by female singers such as Judy Collins, Linda Ronstadt, and Joan Baez, to versions by male singers such as Glen Campbell, and Michael Feinstein. Webb recorded the song three times, in 1977 for his El Mirage album, again in 1996 for his Ten Easy Pieces album and finally in 2012 in a Duet with Joe Cocker for his 2013 album Still Within the Sound of My Voice. The song has attracted a wide range of artists, including the Norwegian singer Radka Toneff, who recorded the song on her 1982 album Fairytales, which in a 2011 poll of Norwegian musicians was voted the best Norwegian album ever. Various instrumental versions have also been recorded, including the 1997 version by Charlie Haden and Pat Metheny on the album Beyond the Missouri Sky (Short Stories), which won a Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Individual or Group.

Biblical references Drawing of the impression made by the onyx seal of Jaazaniah Four distinct individuals named Jaazaniah are mentioned in the Bible: Jaazaniah the son of Hoshaiah was an officer in the army of the kingdom of Judah. He joined the Babylonian-appointed ruler Gedaliah at Mizpah after the exile of Judah ( and ). He was also called Jezaniah. The onyx seal found at Mizpah dating to this period and bearing the inscription “(belonging) to Ya’azaniah the servant of the king” may have belonged to this individual. Jaazaniah, son of a man called Jeremiah (not the prophet), and grandson of Habazziniah, was the leader of the clan of the Rechabites at the time of the prophet Jeremiah. The prophet Jeremiah brings Jaazaniah and other members of his clan to the Temple, where they refuse to drink wine offered to them, in commemoration of their ancestor, Jonadab son of Rechab who had forbidden his followers to drink wine. Jeremiah commends them to the people and shows them as an example of people who know how to keep their principles. (). Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was one of the 70 elders of Israel whom the prophet Ezekiel sees in a vision committing idolatry because they believed that God had abandoned the world and was no longer watching them (Ezekiel 8:11). Jaazaniah son of Azzur was a leader of Israel and a false prophet whom the prophet Ezekiel sees in a vision of iniquitous elders standing at a gate of the Temple, falsely telling the people that Jerusalem will not be destroyed (Ezekiel 11:1). Onyx seal Photograph of the face of the seal, and drawing illustrating its construction from black and white onyx. The name Jaazaniah appears on a sixth-century BC onyx seal discovered during the excavation of the Tell en-Nasbeh site, likely the biblical city of Mizpah in Benjamin, near Jerusalem, conducted between 1926 and 1935 by William Frederic Badè of the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, CA. The seal was found in Stratum 3 of the tell, dating it to the period from shortly after 586 BCE until about 400 BCE (Iron Age II period). The epigraphy of the seal is consistent with dating it to the time of Gedaliah. The seal carries the inscription “(belonging) to Jaazaniah the servant of the king.” The seal may have belonged to an officer named Jaazaniah who, according to II Kings 25:23 and Jeremiah 40:8, came to the Babylonian-appointed ruler Gedaliah at Mizpah after the fall of Jerusalem. At the bottom of the seal is the image of a fighting cock, one of the earliest representations of this bird ever recovered, and certainly the first known representation of the chicken in ancient Israel. This depiction is consistent with the remains of these birds found at other Israelite Iron Age sites, when the rooster was used as a fighting bird. They are also pictured on other seals from the period as a symbol of ferocity, such as on the one engraved on a late seventh-century BCE red jasper seal inscribed “Jehoahaz, son of the king.” See also *List of artifacts significant to the Bible References Category:Hebrew Bible people Category:Archaeology of Israel ","title":"Jaazaniah"},{"id":"34323480","text":"Etiella is a genus of snout moths.
